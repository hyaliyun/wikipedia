For instance, a temperature‚Äìentropy diagram (T‚Äìs diagram) may be used to demonstrate the behavior of a fluid as it is changed by a compressor.  Overview  Especially in meteorology they are used to analyze the actual state of the atmosphere derived from the measurements of radiosondes, usually obtained with weather balloons. In such diagrams, temperature and humidity values (represented by the dew point) are displayed with respect to pressure. Thus the diagram gives at a first glance the actual atmospheric stratification and vertical water vapor distribution. Further analysis gives the actual base and top height of convective clouds or possible instabilities in the stratification. By assuming the energy amount due to solar radiation it is possible to predict the 2 m (6.6 ft) temperature, humidity, and wind during the day, the development of the boundary layer of the atmosphere, the occurrence and development of clouds and the conditions for soaring flight during the day. The main feature of thermodynamic diagrams is the equivalence between the area in the diagram and energy. When air changes pressure and temperature during a process and prescribes a closed curve within the diagram the area enclosed by this curve is proportional to the energy which has been gained or released by the air.  Types of thermodynamic diagrams  General purpose diagrams include: *PV diagram *T‚Äìs diagram *h‚Äìs (Mollier) diagram *Psychrometric chart *Cooling curve *Indicator diagram *Saturation vapor curve *Thermodynamic surface Specific to weather services, there are mainly three different types of thermodynamic diagrams used: * Skew-T log-P diagram * Tephigram * Emagram All three diagrams are derived from the physical P‚Äìalpha diagram which combines pressure (P) and specific volume (alpha) as its basic coordinates. The P‚Äìalpha diagram shows a strong deformation of the grid for atmospheric conditions and is therefore not useful in atmospheric sciences. The three diagrams are constructed from the P‚Äìalpha diagram by using appropriate coordinate transformations. Not a thermodynamic diagram in a strict sense, since it does not display the energy‚Äìarea equivalence, is the * St√ºve diagram But due to its simpler construction it is preferred in education. Characteristics Thermodynamic diagrams usually show a net of five different lines: * isobars = lines of constant pressure * isotherms = lines of constant temperature * dry adiabats = lines of constant potential temperature representing the temperature of a rising parcel of dry air * saturated adiabats or pseudoadiabats = lines representing the temperature of a rising parcel saturated with water vapour * mixing ratio = lines representing the dewpoint of a rising parcel The lapse rate, dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR) and moist adiabatic lapse rate (MALR), are obtained. With the help of these lines, parameters such as cloud condensation level, level of free convection, onset of cloud formation. etc. can be derived from the soundings. Example The path or series of states through which a system passes from an initial equilibrium state to a final equilibrium stateThermodynamics (Third Edition), Kenneth Wark, McGraw-Hill Inc, 1977, and can be viewed graphically on a pressure-volume (P-V), pressure-temperature (P-T), and temperature- entropy (T-s) diagrams.Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics (Seventh Edition), Michael J. Moran, Howard N. Shapiro, Daisie D. Boettner, Margaret B. Bailey, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2011, There are an infinite number of possible paths from an initial point to an end point in a process. In many cases the path matters, however, changes in the thermodynamic properties depend only on the initial and final states and not upon the path.Philip E. Bloomfield, William A. Steele, \\"Thermodynamic processes,\\" in AccessScience, ¬©McGraw-Hill Companies, 2008, http://www.accessscience.com Figure 1 Consider a gas in cylinder with a free floating piston resting on top of a volume of gas at a temperature . If the gas is heated so that the temperature of the gas goes up to while the piston is allowed to rise to as in Figure 1, then the pressure is kept the same in this process due to the free floating piston being allowed to rise making the process an isobaric process or constant pressure process. This Process Path is a straight horizontal line from state one to state two on a P-V diagram. Figure 2 It is often valuable to calculate the work done in a process. The work done in a process is the area beneath the process path on a P-V diagram. Figure 2 If the process is isobaric, then the work done on the piston is easily calculated. For example, if the gas expands slowly against the piston, the work done by the gas to raise the piston is the force F times the distance d. But the force is just the pressure P of the gas times the area A of the piston, F=PA.Physics ‚Äì Principles with Applications (Second Edition), Douglas C, Giancoli, Printice Hall, Inc., 1985, Thus *W=Fd *W=PAd *W=P(V2-V1) figure 3 Now let‚Äôs say that the piston was not able to move smoothly within the cylinder due to static friction with the walls of the cylinder. Assuming that the temperature was increased slowly, you would find that the process path is not straight and no longer isobaric, but would instead undergo an isometric process till the force exceeded that of the frictional force and then would undergo an isothermal process back to an equilibrium state. This process would be repeated till the end state is reached. See figure 3. The work done on the piston in this case would be different due to the additional work required for the resistance of the friction. The work done due to friction would be the difference between the work done on these two process paths. Many engineers neglect friction at first in order to generate a simplified model. For more accurate information, the height of the highest point, or the max pressure, to surpass the static friction would be proportional to the frictional coefficient and the slope going back down to the normal pressure would be the same as an isothermal process if the temperature was increased at a slow enough rate. Another path in this process is an isometric process. This is a process where volume is held constant which shows as a vertical line on a P-V diagram. Figure 3 Since the piston is not moving during this process, there is not any work being done.  References  * The Physics of Atmospheres by John Houghton, Cambridge University Press 2002.

Counting his radio broadcasts, he was a Bruins' announcer for an unprecedented 45 years, and was an active sports announcer for over seven decades. He is best known for yelling \\"SCORE!\\" when a Boston player scored a goal. Biography Early life and career Fred Cusick was born in the Brighton section of Boston. A graduate of (and former hockey player at) Northeastern University in Boston, Cusick began broadcasting sports at WCOP in Boston in 1941 while a senior at Northeastern, crediting his hockey background as the entree to the position. He subsequently went into the United States Navy in World War II, rising to lieutenant in command of a subchaser. After the war, he worked for several radio stations, hosting the popular Irish Hour on WVOM in Brookline, which focused on sports, especially hockey. After a brief time in Washington during the Korean War and upon the retirement of Bruins' radio broadcaster Frank Ryan, Cusick ‚Äì paired with ex-Bruin Jack Crawford ‚Äì became the radio play-by-play broadcaster of the Bruins from 1952 to 1963, during which time he was also Sports Director for WEEI radio in Boston. Cusick was the announcer for the first US network NHL broadcast (CBS- TV in January 1957); he would spend four years in all working the NHL Game of the Week for CBS. 1960s-1970s Fred Cusick was the color commentator on WEEI for the very first game of the fledgling American Football League, a Friday night contest between the Denver Broncos and the Boston Patriots on September 9, 1960, at Nickerson Field on the campus of Boston University. He served as the color man for Patriots radio between 1960 and 1964. He also had a notable interview with golfing legend Francis Ouimet in 1963, on the fiftieth anniversary of Ouimet's 1913 U.S. Open victory. It is the only video interview of Ouimet in existence. In the early 1960s, Cusick was responsible for getting Boston Bruins' games on local television on a regular basis. In 1963, Bruins CEO Weston Adams asked Fred and producer/director Neal P. Cortel to arrange the first-ever live telecast of a Bruins game from the old Boston Garden. The experimental telecast was wildly popular, and later during the 1963/1964 season, Fred hosted the Sunday morning rebroadcasts of edited CBC Television tapes of Saturday night Bruins games in Montreal and Toronto; flown back overnight with the team, seen first at 9 AM on WMUR-TV in Manchester, New Hampshire and WTEV-TV (now WLNE-TV) in the Providence/New Bedford market (the signal[s] of which covered most of the Boston area), then at 1 PM on the old WHDH-TV (now WCVB-TV) in Boston, WWLP-TV in Springfield, and WRLP-TV in Northampton. Fred's telecasts were enormously popular, and within a few years, games would be shown live on WKBG and later began a long run at WSBK-TV. From 1969 through 1971, Cusick was the radio voice of the Boston Bruins on WBZ-AM 1030 (Bob Wilson replaced him on WBZ-AM starting in 1972) when they reached the pinnacle of their popularity, winning their first Stanley Cup in 29 years in 1970, and setting a regular-season record for points and goals scored in 1970‚Äì71. His broadcasting partners were former NHL players Johnny Peirson in 1969‚Äì70 and Cal Gardner in 1970‚Äì71. In 1971, Cusick returned to TV, succeeding Don Earle, who had been hired by WSBK when they began covering the Boston Bruins, as play-by-play man for Bruins' games on WSBK with Peirson as his color man; when NESN was formed in 1984, he did double duty for 11 years, calling games for both channels, first with Johnny Peirson and later Derek Sanderson. In his last years before he retired from broadcasting the Bruins, he did games only on WSBK. 1980s-1990s He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the first wave of media honorees in 1984, and in that year was also named the first winner of the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award (along with Danny Gallivan, Rene Lecavalier and Hewitt himself), \\"in recognition of members of the radio and television industry who made outstanding contributions to their profession and the game during their career in hockey broadcasting.\\" He has also won the Lester Patrick Trophy in 1988 for outstanding service to hockey in the United States. It was Cusick who did the television play-by-play of the last Bruins' game at the old Boston Garden (a pre-season game against Montreal in 1995) and the first Bruins' game in the FleetCenter, the 1995‚Äì96 season-opener against the New York Islanders. 2000s After retiring from the Bruins' broadcasts in 1997, he began broadcasting home games for the AHL Lowell Lock Monsters with former Bruin Brad Park as his partner. He retired for good as a hockey sportscaster after the 2002 season at the age of 83. In 2007, he returned to the broadcast booth as the Cape Cod Baseball League game of the week play-by-play announcer on WBZ (AM) Radio. His autobiography, Fred Cusick: Voice of the Bruins (), was published in October 2006. Death Fred Cusick died in his sleep on September 15, 2009 at his home in Barnstable, Massachusetts from complications of bladder cancer. The following day he was posthumously inducted into the Massachusetts Broadcasters Hall of Fame, an honor he had been scheduled to receive before his death.

It is primarily intended to provide a minimum standard for due diligence to support responsible risk decision-making. As at February 2019, 94 adopting financial institutions in 37 countries have officially adopted the Equator Principles, covering the majority of international Project Finance debt in emerging and developed markets.Wright, Christopher, and Alexis Rwabizambuga. \\"Institutional pressures, corporate reputation, and voluntary codes of conduct: An examination of the equator principles.\\" Business and Society Review 111.1 (2006): 89-117. The Equator Principles, formally launched in Washington DC on 4 June 2003, were based on existing environmental and social policy frameworks established by the International Finance Corporation. The standards have subsequently been periodically updated into what is commonly known as the International Finance Corporation Performance Standards on social and environmental sustainability and on the World Bank Group Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines. The Equator Principles have recently been revised and the third iteration of the Equator Principles was launched on 4 June 2013. The Equator Principles are currently under review, with the intent of developing their fourth iteration during 2018-2019. The Equator Principles apply globally, to all industry sectors and (within in EPIII) to four financial products 1) Project Finance Advisory Services 2) Project Finance 3) Project-Related Corporate Loans and 4) Bridge Loans. The relevant thresholds and criteria for application is described in detail in the Scope section of the Equator Principles. Equator Principles Financial Institutions (EPFIs) commit to implementing the EP in their internal environmental and social policies, procedures and standards for financing projects and will not provide Project Finance or Project-Related Corporate Loans to projects where the client will not, or is unable to, comply with the Equator Principles. While the Equator Principles are not intended to be applied retroactively, EPFIs apply them to the expansion or upgrade of an existing project where changes in scale or scope may create significant environmental and social risks and impacts, or significantly change the nature or degree of an existing impact. The Equator Principles have greatly increased the attention and focus on social/community standards and responsibility, including robust standards for indigenous peoples, labour standards, and consultation with locally affected communities within the Project Finance market. They have also promoted convergence around common environmental and social standards. Multilateral development banks, including the European Bank for Reconstruction & Development, and export credit agencies through the OECD Common Approaches are increasingly drawing on the same standards as the Equator Principles. The Equator Principles have also helped spur the development of other responsible environmental and social management practices in the financial sector and banking industry and have provided a platform for engagement with a broad range of interested stakeholders, including non-governmental organisations (NGOs), clients and industry bodies. Members and reporting As of April 2017, 89 financial institutionshttp://equator-principles.com/members- reporting/ in 37 countries have officially adopted the Equator Principles. Their annual reporting related to Principle 10 is available here. The principles Principle 1: Review and Categorisation Principle 2: Environmental and Social Assessment Principle 3: Applicable Environmental and Social Standards Principle 4: Environmental and Social Management System and Equator Principles Action Plan Principle 5: Stakeholder Engagement Principle 6: Grievance Mechanism Principle 7: Independent Review Principle 8: Covenants Principle 9: Independent Monitoring and Reporting Principle 10: Reporting and Transparency Criticism NGOs have generally welcomed the Principles, but some have expressed concerns over their integrity. One of these is that the Principles will not make a real difference. They argue the case of the Baku- Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, which, in 2004, was financed by eight Equator Principles' banks and the IFC despite an NGO assessment that found 127 alleged breaches. The banks and IFC said they were confident that the Equator Principles were followed, and said an independent consultant had confirmed this assessment.BTC Project is the First Major Test of the Equator Principles Another expressed concern was that the banks might lobby the IFC to weaken its standards on which the Principles are based. The banks point out that IFC revised and strengthened its policies in 2006 and that the banks correspondingly strengthened the Equator Principles in the same year. Other criticisms include alleged lack of enforcement and accountability, free- riders, and that the scope of the principles is limited to project finance only. Several banks have sought to address these concerns by publishing summaries of their Equator Principles screening, including the number of projects they turned down for noncompliance. In 2005 some NGOs said that one of the adopting banks, ABN AMRO (before it was split up in 2010), was the most climate-unfriendly bank in the Netherlands, with estimated annual indirect CO2 emissions of almost 250 million tonnes in 2005 from industries to which it provides financial services. NGOs said this was just over the annual CO2-emissions of the Netherlands and almost 1% of the total annual worldwide CO2 emissions at the time. ABN AMRO defended its environmental record and announced steps to reduce its direct emissions, but some NGOs say it is the indirect emissions through their clients that make global banks such important targets in climate change. Following the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, investors learned that 13 of the 17 banks that financed the Dakota Access Pipeline were signatories to the Equator Principles. Despite concerns being raised that the project could threaten the water supply from Lake Oahe and the Missouri River if a leak occurred, project financing was still approved.http://www.ethicalcorp.com/why-banks-need-plug-gaps-equator- principles-prevent-community- conflicthttps://investorsforhumanrights.org/events/webinar-equator-principles- iv-human-rights-perspective See also *Corporate social responsibility *Ethical banking *Ethical investing *Socially responsible investing *Special purpose entity *Cross-sector biodiversity initiative References External links *www.equator-principles.com Official website of the Equator Principles. *www.BankTrack.org NGO website with fact sheet on the Equator Principles and critical comments. *www.BankTrack.org BankTrack comments on revised Equator Principles, July 7, 2006. * Equator Principles website discussion of the BTC project criticism. * ABN AMRO report on its application of the Equator Principles to the BTC pipeline project. * IFC rebuttal of NGO criticism of its environmental and social assessment of the BTC pipeline project. * The Equator Principles and IFC Performance Standards in Mining. *A Legal Guide - The Equator Principles * Review of the Equator Principles ‚Äì Towards EP4 Category:Ethical banking Category:Investment Category:Corporate social responsibility ","title":"Equator Principles"},{"id":"4262609","title":"Threaded binary tree"},{"id":"4262620","text":"Rojdi is an archaeological site belonging to the Indus valley civilization.

Chronology The site was excavated for seven seasons between 1982 and 1995 by the Gujarat State Department of Archaeology and the University Museum at the University of Pennsylvania. The excavation confirmed three periods of occupation, called Rojdi A, B and C. Twenty radiocarbon dates have helped to estimate the chronology of Rojdi as follows:Possehl, Gregory. (2004). The Indus Civilization: A contemporary perspective, New Delhi: Vistaar Publications, , pp.82-6. * Rojdi C 1900-1700 BCE * Rojdi B 2200-1900 BCE * Rojdi A 2500-2200 BCE Architecture Two large excavation areas have been exposed at Rojdi, which are known as the South Extension and the Main Mound. There was also a systematic excavation at an outer gateway and at an isolated structure at the northern slope of the site. All of these very finely preserved structures can be dated to Rojdi C period (early second millennium BCE). The houses in Rojdi were built on stone foundations, probably with mud walls above them. No bricks were found, baked or otherwise, in the excavations. No wells, bathing platforms and the associated street drains were found either. The material culture Much of the pottery found in Rojdi is a hard, red to buff ware made from well-prepared clay. The most frequently found vessel is the hemispherical red ware bowl, often with a stud handle, this accounts for over half of all shreds recovered from Rojdi. The pottery often has graffiti with signs from the Indus script, such as jar sign. There is also a short inscription in Harappan writing on the rim of a potshred. Five (four complete and one broken) copper or bronze flat axes were found, all belonged to Rojdi C period. Signs of industrial and manufacturing activities are absent in all phases at Rojdi. Its overall character suggests a farmer's village.

Dubris, also known as Portus Dubris and Dubrae, was a port in Roman Britain on the site of present-day Dover, Kent, England. As the closest point to continental Europe and the site of the estuary of the Dour, the site chosen for Dover was ideal for a cross-channel port. The Dour is now covered over for much of its course through the town. In the Roman era, it grew into an important military, mercantile and cross-channel harbour and ‚Äì with Rutupiae ‚Äì one of the two starting points of the road later known as Watling Street. It was fortified and garrisoned initially by the Classis Britannica, and later by troops based in a Saxon Shore Fort. Julius Caesar At the start of his first attempt to conquer Britain in 55BC Julius Caesar initially tried to land at Dubris, whose natural harbour had presumably been identified by Volusenus as a suitable landing place. However, when he came in sight of shore, the massed forces of the Britons gathered on the overlooking hills and cliffs dissuaded him from landing there, since the cliffs were \\"so close to the shore that javelins could be thrown down from\\" them onto anyone landing there.Commentarii de Bello Gallico 4.23 After waiting there at anchor \\"until the ninth hour\\" (about 3pm) waiting for his supply ships from the second port to come up and meanwhile convening a council of war, he ordered his subordinates to act on their own initiative and then sailed the fleet about seven miles along the coast to an open beach. Classis Britannica fort The Roman fleet in British waters, the Classis Britannica's main purpose was protecting the Gaul-to-Britain routes and supporting the land army in Britannia, not defending the British Isles from invasion. For this reason, its main harbor was in Gesoriacum (Boulogne), not Dover. However, it did have other, smaller bases in Britannia itself, at Rutupiae and Dubris. Lighthouses The Roman lighthouse at Dover Castle. The Western Pharos aka The Bredenstone Two lighthouses, each called the Pharos, were built soon after the conquest. Proposals of their date range from 50 (only seven years after the invasion of 43), 80 or (since the building includes tiles identical to the mansio in the town built at that date) c. 138, though the general consensus is for a 1st-century AD date. They were sited on the two heights (Eastern Heights and Western Heights) and modelled on the one built for Caligula's aborted invasion at Boulogne. The one on the Eastern Heights still stands in the grounds of Dover Castle to 80 feet (24 m) high close to its original height, and has been adapted for use as the bell tower of the adjacent castle church of St Mary de Castro. This Roman Pharos has been a Grade I-listed building since 1974. What little remains of the western lighthouse is called the Bredenstone or the Devil's Drop of Mortar after the putative nearby lost village of Braddon, within Drop Redoubt on Dover Western Heights ‚Äì it was covered in the 18th-century building works but then rediscovered in fresh works in the 1860s, and was the traditional site of the investiture of the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. Peak At its peak, Dubris was a major trading centre, taking over from Rutupiae as the main Roman cross-Channel port. With Rutupiae, it was one of the starting points for Watling Street, the Roman road to Canterbury and, ultimately, London. Roman Painted House During the construction of the new A256/York Street bypass in the 1970s Roman remains were discovered and an eight-week excavation followed. The archaeologists discovered a Roman mansio now known as the \\"Roman Painted House\\". The mansio, a hostel for government officials, was built in c. 200. It was discovered in 1970 by the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit and, as it houses some of the finest example of Roman murals in Britain (over . of painted plaster, the most extensive ever found north of the Alps), it has been called \\"Britain's Buried Pompeii\\". Wall painting Above a lower dado, of red or green, an architectural scheme of multi-coloured panels framed by fluted columns is still visible. The columns sit on projecting bases above a stage, producing a clear 3-D effect. Parts of 28 panels survive, each with a motif relating to Bacchus, the Roman God of wine. This Bacchic link, and the building's proximity to the baths, port and fort, has been said by some to suggest that the Painted House was once a brothel. However, this is entirely circumstantial evidence (frescos in brothels tended to be more explicit, as in those at Pompeii, and Bacchic motifs are very commonly found in simply domestic areas) and so most academics believe the rooms are too small to have supported this line of work and instead support its designation as a mansio. Other features of the Painted House include the Dover Gems, a medieval cut in the floor allowing the hypocaust system to be viewed and a medieval skeleton found in the nearby St Martin-le-Grand church, nicknamed \\"Fred\\" by the volunteers who keep the museum running. Saxon Shore fort Dubris's mansio was demolished in 270 for the construction of a Saxon Shore fort. This demolition preserved the mansio and its wall-paintings better than usual, since the foots of the walls were contained in the fort's rampart. 13th century Peutinger Map showing Roman roads between Canterbury, Richborough, Dover and Lympne Visible remains A small amount of the fort remains is now visible, on request, at Dover Library and Discovery Centre (the former White Cliffs Experience), and a public house off Market Square is built on and named after the Roman Quay. The most extensive and publicly accessible remains are at the Roman Painted House, where parts of the mansio, Saxon Shore Fort and Classis Britannica fort are all visible. 1980s excavations The town council had plans to build a car park on the site, when the KARU team, led by Brian Philp, began to find Roman remains. After a convoluted battle with the council and the builders, the excavation was allowed to continue and a cover- building was built on the site by KARU while the carpark was built elsewhere, with the museum being completed before the car park. It has since received thousands of visitors, including the Queen Mother, who signed a specially- presented guestbook. Philp continues to curate, giving talks to schoolchildren, tourists and academics alike. Other artefacts including an extremely important glass vessel are kept on the site, attracting academic study in recent years. This cover-building still stands over these remains. It has changed little since then and is now under threat from lack of funding. Many in the local area have commented that the site would have been better presented had it been integrated with the rest of the site, which was instead largely reburied under the new bypass, which was specially inclined to protect the remains, and White Cliffs Experience. All this has been widely criticised by, among others, Philp himself, who has said: References External links * Roman Painted House ‚Äì Official Site * Roman Painted House * Council for Kentish Archaeology * Roman Dover Category:Archaeological sites in Kent Category:History of Dover, Kent Category:Roman fortifications in England Category:Roman towns and cities in England Category:Saxon Shore forts Category:Former populated places in Kent Category:Museums in Kent Category:Museums of ancient Rome in the United Kingdom Category:Archaeological museums in England Category:Roman harbors in England Category:Grade I listed buildings in Kent Category:Grade I listed lighthouses ","title":"Dubris"},{"id":"4262671","text":"Saint Mildburh (alternatively Milburga or Milburgh) (died 23 February 727) was the Benedictine abbess of Wenlock Priory. Her feast day is 23 February. Life St Milburga's Priory, Much Wenlock Santa Milburga, c. 1605, by Juan de Roelas Mildburh was a daughter of Merewalh, King of the Mercian sub-kingdom of Magonsaete, and Domne Eafe. She was the older sister of Saint Mildrith and Saint Mildgytha. The three sisters have been likened to the three theological virtues: Milburh to faith, Mildgytha to hope, and Mildrith to charity.O.S.B., \\"Saint Mildred and her Kinsfolk\\", Virgin Saints of the Benedictine Order, Catholic Truth Society, London, 1903 Mildburh was sought in marriage by a neighboring prince, who resolved to have her for his wife, even at the cost of violence. Mildburh's escape took her across a river. The prince, in hot pursuit, was forced to desist when the river miraculously became so swollen that he was unable to ford. Mildburh entered the Benedictine monastery of Wenlock, Shropshire (now known as Much Wenlock). The nunnery was founded with endowments by her father and her uncle, Wulfhere of Mercia,\\"St. Milburga\\", Diocese of Shrewsbury under the direction of a French Abbess, Liobinde of Chelles. Milburga eventually succeeded her in this office,\\"St. Milburga\\", Beckbury Village and was installed as abbess by St Theodore. Educated in France, Mildburh was noted for her humility, and, according to popular stories, was endowed with the gift of healing and restored sight to the blind. She organised the evangelisation and pastoral care of south Shropshire. She is said to have had a mysterious power over birds; they would avoid damaging the local crops when she asked them to. She was also associated with miracles, such as the creation of a spring and the miraculous growth of barley. One story relates that one morning she overslept and woke to find the sun shining on her. Her veil slipped but instead of falling to the ground was suspended on a sunbeam until she collected it. She died on 23 February 727.\\"St. Milburga\\", St. Milburga's Roman Catholic Church, Church Stretton Her feast day is thus 23 February. There is evidence that Saint Mildburh was syncretized with a pagan goddess. According to medievalist Pamela Berger, \\"this saint was chosen to fill the role of grain protectress in Shropshire when the ancient pagan protectress could no longer be venerated.\\" Norman discovery Her tomb was long venerated until her abbey was destroyed by invading Danes. After the Norman Conquest Cluniac monks built a monastery on the site ‚Äì the ruins at Much Wenlock are those of the later house. The Cluniac monks arrived at Wenlock from France, and on discovering what they believed to be the bones of Mildburh, began, in 1101, a process of establishing her relics as a pilgrimage destination for lepers. This was unpopular with the local English people, but successfully attracted people from France and Wales. It also encouraged a spate of written accounts of her life and miracles. A document entitled Miracula Inventionis Beatae Mylburge Virginis was produced at about this time, and possibly soon afterwards the well-known hagiographer Goscelin wrote his Vita Mildburga into which he incorporated a pre-existing account called 'Mildburh's Testimony', which purports to be a first-person account of her life. She is named in some of the genealogies of the Kentish Royal Legend, which appear to draw on Anglo Saxon material, but have no surviving manuscript copies that pre-date the 11th century. She is also one of the 89 saints listed with their locations in the 11th-century text written in Old English, known as the Secgan, or On the Resting-Places of the Saints.* Notes External links * *Milburga at Patron Saints Index *23 February saints at SaintPatrickDC.org Category:Year of birth missing Category:715 deaths Category:Anglo-Saxon royalty Category:Mercian saints Category:Anglo-Saxon nuns Category:8th-century Christian saints Category:People from Much Wenlock Category:Benedictine nuns Category:Female saints of medieval England Category:8th-century Christian nuns Category:Medieval English saints Category:House of Icel Category:7th-century English people Category:7th- century English women Category:8th-century English people Category:8th-century English women ","title":"Mildburh"},{"id":"4262677","text":"Time in Brazil is calculated using standard time, However, in a non-binding referendum held on 31 October 2010, a slight majority of Acre voters voted in favour of returning the state to GMT‚àí05:00.

Details  The production and presentation team was largely taken from the earlier Channel 4 success Network 7 and had the same editor Charlie Parsons. At the time Club X was commissioned Channel 4‚Äôs new Chief Executive Michael Grade was attempting to make the channel‚Äôs cultural programming more accessible ‚Äì a process regarded by some as dumbing down. The Club X format was intended to blend items on relatively high-brow arts with the kind of quirky stories and items that had been features of Network 7, such as feminist pornography. Club X was broadcast live over 23 weeks during Summer 1989 in a Wednesday night 90-minute slot scheduled directly against BBC2‚Äôs new arts magazine The Late Show, another production by Network 7 graduates. There was an edited repeat the following Sunday. Fortunately the show's presenters led by Murray Boland and Martina Attille had live experience yet struggled bravely with the often spurious chaotic direction. The other presenters included drag artist Regina Fong and Fou Fou L Hunter. Hunter, a version of Leigh Bowery dressed as a green fairy, and who died mid-series (11 August 1989). In a reference to the then current Acid House scene the programme‚Äôs set was modelled on the nightclub Heaven though the constant background music made it impossible for the presenters to hear cues and studio interviews were often inaudible while members of the audience occasionally interfered with the set ups. Each week was themed around an avant-garde art movement, Dada, Surrealism etc. Buygones Club X was the first television work of Victor Lewis-Smith whose stand-alone segment Buygones featured humorous takes on disastrously conceived consumer items such as the Aztec Bar, or OMO washing powder. The comedy of the Buygones section was augmented by the amateurism of the programme that surrounded it. Memorable moments A staging of a Futurist supper during which the waiter poured water over Paul Morley who then punched the waiter and walked out. A re-enactment of Yves Klein's Anthropometry performance in which nude female models covered each other in blue paint and then rolled against a canvas. The item drew criticism as the programme was broadcast without a disclaimer. Cancellation An edited version of the Wednesday broadcast was shown at 2pm the following Sunday. Although the edited version tidied up the presentation and removed the more graphic elements, the content remained the same and an off-colour remark about the dead comedian Eric Morecambe drew complaints. A second series was not commissioned; as Channel 4 had (unusually) produced the series in-house, the channel bore the full cost. This made it one of the most expensive failures in the company‚Äôs history. Some elements such as 'Buygones' were recycled as stand-alone programmes or greatest hits compilations. Charlie Parsons went on to set up a production company with Waheed Ali, which then merged with Planet Pictures, brainchild of Tony Boland. Planet Pictures went on to produce several shows including The Big Breakfast and \\"The Word,\\" out of which several successful media careers were launched.

They were great innovators - not always successfully - and their locos had many original features. In 1838 two were built for the broad gauge Great Western Railway to the patent of T.E. Harrison, who later became the chief engineer for the North Eastern Railway. These could be viewed as the forerunners of the Garratt, with the boiler carried on a separate carriage to the cylinders and valvegear. This allowed the boiler to be large and low down, being carried on smaller wheels, while the driving wheels could be up to in diameter. With little weight on the drivers, adhesion was poor, but they ran very smoothly up to . However, the flexible steam coupling gave a great deal of trouble and they were withdrawn. They continued to build more conventional engines, possibly under sub- contract, among them, three for the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway. In 1850 the company built their first tank locomotive which was supplied to the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway. In the 1850s, they also built six 4-4-0ST, Crampton locomotives of the Sondes class for the East Kent Railway.Bradley (1979), pp. 19-20. Also, in the quest for a low centre of gravity, four 0-4-0s with the drivers spaced at apart connected to the cylinders by a dummy crankshaft. These were soon withdrawn, and the Cramptons rebuilt into traditional 2-4-0 tanks. CTR&D; No. 4 Wellington, derailed during labour unrest In 1860 eight tender locomotives with a 0-4-2 wheel arrangement, the first tender locomotives to work in South Africa, were built for the Cape Town Railway and Dock Company.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J.

In 1870 they built St. Peter's Works adjoining that of Robert Stephenson and Company and in 1880 amalgamated with the shipbuilder A. Leslie and Company, to become Hawthorn Leslie and Company. Hawthorns and Company, Leith In 1846 they bought the Leith Engine Works, in Leith, Scotland, for the assembly of locomotives prepared in Newcastle. These works were sold to another company also called Hawthorns and Company, which produced some four hundred locomotives on its own account until 1872. Cape Town station In 1859 Hawthorns, Leith, built an 0-4-0T locomotive for Messrs E. & J. Pickering, contractors for the construction of the Cape Town- Wellington Railway in the Cape Colony. This locomotive was the first steam locomotive to run in South Africa. In 1861 the Cape Town-Wellington Railway Company took over all construction, and the locomotive, from Pickerings and the locomotive became the Cape Town-Wellington Railway's no 9, later to become known as \\"Blackie\\". It was subsequently rebuilt to a configuration. In 1936 it was proclaimed a national monument and has since been plinthed in the concourse at Cape Town station. Notes and references *Bradley, D.L.

It once was the second- largest listed Portuguese bank and the ninth-largest contributor to the PSI-20 index. BES was the second-largest private financial institution in Portugal in terms of net assets (‚Ç¨80,700 million in March 2011), with an average market share of 20.3% in Portugal and 2.1 million clients. On 3 August 2014, Banco de Portugal, Portugal's central bank, announced a ‚Ç¨4.4 billion bailout of BES that heralded the end of BES as a private bank. The bailout was funded by the Portuguese Resolution Fund (). The bank was split into a healthy bank, Novo Banco, while the toxic assets remain in the existing bank. It has since been proven that the administration of BES led by Ricardo Salgado \\"disobeyed the Bank of Portugal 21 times, between December 2013 and July 2014\\", practising \\"wilful acts of ruinous management\\".  History  Branch of Banco Esp√≠rito Santo in Braga, Portugal. Banco Esp√≠rito Santo's origins began with the lottery, currency exchange, and securities business carried out by Jos√© Maria do Esp√≠rito Santo e Silva between 1869 and 1884. The first references to trading that the ‚Äúpatriarch of the only dynasty of Portuguese bankers‚Äù was undertaking was in the purchase and sale of lotteries, along with national and international transactions in loan securities, on his own account. This took place in his Casa de Cambio, situated in centre of Lisbon and which dated back to the second half of the 19th century (1869). Since then and until 1920, he founded a number of banking institutions, such as Beir√£o, Silva Pinto & C¬™., (1884‚Äì1887), Silva, Beir√£o, Pinto & C¬™. (1897‚Äì1911), J. M. Esp√≠rito Santo Silva (1911‚Äì1915), and J. M. Esp√≠rito Santo Silva & C¬™. (1915). In 1915, after the death of Jos√© Maria do Esp√≠rito Santo e Silva, these firms were dissolved and his heirs founded the Casa Banc√°ria Esp√≠rito Santo Silva & C¬™, which was transformed into a public limited-liability company in 1920 under the name Banco Esp√≠rito Santo with the bank, in this decade, managing to consolidate its position within the context of national banking by opening agencies and using a renewed management model. In 1937, the bank strengthened its position in commercial banking through a merger with Banco Comercial de Lisboa to form Banco Esp√≠rito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa (BESCL), which again changed its name to BES in 1999. Up to the mid-1970s, BESCL reinforced its international presence with acquisitions, partnerships, and the creation of banks in countries such as the United States, Angola, and the United Kingdom, among others. Under a Decree Law of 1975, the bank was nationalised and the Esp√≠rito Santo family was prevented from doing business in Portugal. Within this context, the family re-established its financial interests abroad in countries such as Brazil, Switzerland, France, and the United States, culminating in 1975 with the creation of a holding company based in Luxembourg. This company was the predecessor of the Esp√≠rito Santo Financial Group (ESFG).ESFG - Nossa historia retrieved July 13, 2011 The return to Portugal began in 1986 in partnership with Cr√©dit Agricole and with the support of a core group of Portuguese shareholders. They formed the Banco Internacional de Cr√©dito (BIC), also forming Esp√≠rito Santo Sociedade de Investimentos (ESSI), together with Swiss bank UBS and KBC Bank of Luxembourg. In 1990, the Esp√≠rito Santo Group recovered Companhia de Seguros Tranquilidade ‚Äî the Espirito Santo family held a stake since 1935 ‚Äî and the control of Banco Esp√≠rito Santo in 1991 with the creation of a holding company between ESFG and Cr√©dit Agricole, called BESPAR. In 1992, BES began operating in the Spanish market where it created Banco Esp√≠rito Santo S.A. and in 1995, to open Banco Esp√≠rito Santo do Oriente (BESOR) that offers corporate and investment solutions to private clients. Also, in 2001, Banco Esp√≠rito Santo Angola, a bank formed under Angolan law, was founded. In the first six months of 2014 the bank lost the equivalent of $4.8 billion raising concerns about the health of the bank. BES shares fell by 89 per cent. On 3 August 2014, Portugal's central bank announced BES would be restructured by splitting the bank into two. This announcement, following BES record Q2 loss of ‚Ç¨3.49 billion, allowed Portuguese stocks to outperform the broader European market the next day.  Former structure  BES has had a stable shareholder structure since 1991. The main shareholders, ESFG and Cr√©dit Agricole, hold 50.8% of the capital. The Group's presence today is felt in 23 countries on four continents through branches, offices of representation, or sub-companies, making the Banco Esp√≠rito Santo Group the most international of the Portuguese financial groups. Since 2007, BES has been the only Portuguese bank to be included on the sustainability index FTSE4Good Index reinforcing its positioning as a socially responsible institution.

History 1979‚Äì1982: Early History and Sharks' formation Sharks started in 1979 by vocalist Rick Czerny and lead guitarist, Spencer Sercombe. Czerny and Sercombe met in high school playing together and began writing original material. Spencer eventually began working for B.C. Rich guitars. While working at B.C. Rich, Spencer had a hand in the designing of one their most popular guitars, The Warlock. The band practiced out of a small home in a commercial area in Arcadia on Santa Clara Street. The walls of the studio were lined with empty Mickey's Big Mouth bottles, the official Sharks beer and the inspiration behind the band's original logo. The band was completed by drummer Dave Bishop and bassist Jim Volpicelli. The original band of Czerny, Sercombe, Volpicelli and Bishop released an independent album called Altar Ego in 1982. This album was produced by Jerry Tolman, and featured organist Mike \\"The Fin\\" Finnegan. Both had done work with Stephen Stills. Executive producer was Jeff Willmitt. It was recorded at That Studio in North Hollywood. As well as Altar Ego, Sharks released three singles. The first was a unique \\"triple fin-shaped\\" 45, that when inserted into the jacket, cut through the ocean image on the cover. Side A was \\"Kid Sister\\" and Side B was \\"Your Car or Mine.\\" Both were recorded at Mystic Studios in Hollywood, CA. \\"Hey\\" was a live single recorded on May 10th, 1981 at The Ice House in Pasadena, Sharks' hometown. On the flip side was Mark Bolan's \\"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\\". The executive producer for both 45s was Jeff Willmitt. The artwork of \\"Hey\\" featured a black 45 rpm sleeve with \\"Live Sharks\\" across the top in bold red letters with three USDA stamps stating, \\"Guaranteed Live\\" on the top of the stamp. \\"Packed in Its Own Juice\\" was on the bottom of the stamp. In the middle of the stamp it said, \\"U.S.D.A. Shark Meat Choice\\" looking like an actual stamp from the U.S.D.A. The other single was \\"I'm Electric\\" which featured a drum machine rather than Bishop playing real and live drums. On the backside of that single is \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\". The lyrics are substituted and recorded to the tune of the Judas Priest song, \\"Heading Out to the Highway\\". No artwork was created for this second single. This was considered a \\"souvenir\\" and was given out to the fans when Sharks headlined. Oftentimes, Sharks made themselves available after their performances to the dozens of fans who wanted, and somewhat demanded, autographs to these same \\"souvenirs.\\" During those years, Sharks became one of the most popular bands to emerge from the Los Angeles rock scene. American Heroes/Mondo Cane was an act that either opened for Sharks or had Sharks opening for them during their numerous performances. Moreover, there were multiple occasions when both bands played in the same venues such as The Whiskey, The Icehouse, The Roxy or The Troubadour. It was at that time that Lanny Cordola, American Heroes/Mondo Cane's guitarist and songwriter, began noticing the unique, one-of-a-kind and riveting stage persona and antics of Sharks' vocalist, Richard Czerny. Lanny seriously entertained the idea of Czerny being the frontman for American Heroes/Mondo Cane. However, both bands continued to perform separately without Cordola and Czerny ever discussing the idea. Rick Czerny, who later changed his name to Richard Black, had his unique and signature stage moves and dancing that eventually inspired and were an influence to Axl Rose. When Axl Rose had been asked about this \\"influence\\", Rose either avoided or ignored answering those questions altogether and would immediately change the subject. Dave Bishop was the drummer of Sharks while they were enjoying the height of their popularity in Hollywood, CA. Bishop used various shapes and sizes of cowbell instruments in his drumming giving him his unique sound along with his unusual style of playing. His drum kit had a shark's jaws permanently fastened to the outer drum head of his bass drum facing the crowd. Jim Volpicelli was handled the duties of playing bass guitar for Sharks. One of Volcipelli's bass guitars was custom-designed and had an air-brushed shark's head and teeth painted at the left side and at the end near the volume/tone knobs. Much like Michael Anthony of Van Halen, Volpicelli's vocals were strong and melodic bringing a very different sound to Sharks and Hollywood's rock scene. Many bands, at that time, only had the vocals of the lead vocalist with no background vocals. Clearly, this set Sharks apart from almost all of the current-playing rock bands at that time. 1985‚Äì1986: Name change and S'cool Buss In 1985, Sharks changed their name to Shark Island. In the tradition of Van Halen, M√∂tley Cr√ºe and other Los Angeles bands, Shark Island became the house band at Gazzari's on the Sunset Strip. Owner Bill Gazzari helped produce a cover of the Frank Sinatra song \\"New York, New York\\" which appeared on the band's independently released album, S'cool Buss, in 1986. The line-up now included Richard Black on lead vocals, Spencer \\"Burner\\" Sercombe on guitar/vocals, Walt Woodward III (ex- Rachel, Americade) on drums/vocals, Tom Rucci on bass/vocals/keyboards and Michael Guy on guitar/bass. Rick Derringer produced most of the album and there were 1,200 copies made (200 in a red cover and 1,000 in a turquoise color). \\"Palace of Pleasure\\" was the unofficial single of this album. The former Sharks' rhythm section, Jim Volpicelli (bass) and Dave Bishop (drums) are credited with co-writing four of its nine songs. Sharks Island were able to secure a record development deal. They were signed by A&M; Records for one year with no promise of being permanently signed to an official record contract. During this time, the line-up continued to shift with drummer Walt Woodward III leaving to join The Scream and on-and-off guitarist K.K. Martin parting ways due to \\"artistic differences\\". Rob Pace, from Chicago, filled in on drums during this time. Sercombe also did studio work with Sparks, playing guitar on the band's 1988 Interior Design album. 1989‚Äì1994: Law of the Order, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure and Point Break Chris Heilman and drummer Greg Ellis joined in 1989 to record and release the band's only official album, at that time, entitled, Law of the Order. The official single of that \\"debut\\" album, \\"Paris Calling\\" had an elaborate music video. Randy Nicklaus was the producer for Shark Island on that album on Epic Records. It's generally speculated that Randy was not familiar enough with Sharks/Shark Island's high-energy and bombastic live performances, and therefore not being able to fully capture Shark Island as they truly performed live. With the disappointing CD sales of the album and no promotion from Epic Records, the band vanished from the scene with most of its members joining other projects. Law of the Order was re-issued in 2004 by French independent label, Bad Reputation, as a double CD. That included bonus tracks culled from the July 14, 1989 Bastille Day - Alive At The Whiskey EP, \\"Father Time\\" and \\"Dangerous\\" from the 1989 Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure soundtrack, \\"My City\\" from the 1991 Point Break soundtrack, and LOTO era live cuts, \\"Spellbound' and \\"Sanctuary\\". In 1994, the band attempted to re-form with the new line-up of Ricky Ricardo on bass, Eric Ragno (Takara, Seven Witches) - keyboards, Richard Black - vocals, Simon Wright (AC/DC, Dio) - drums and Damir Simic Shine on guitar. 1991‚Äì2012: Break-up and solo projects * Richard Black went on to join short-lived supergroup Contraband in 1991, with Michael Schenker and Bobby Blotzer (Ratt), Share Pedersen (Vixen) and Tracii Guns (L.A. Guns). Black started a band called Black 13 in the mid-1990s but never released any albums. In late 2000, it was announced that Black would front Bourgeois Pigs, a band put together by guitarist Michael Guy (ex-Shark Island, Fire, House of Lords) and also featuring Jake E. Lee (ex-Ozzy Osbourne, Badlands) on lead guitar and Tony Franklin (ex-The Firm, Blue Murder) on bass. Ultimately, the band disbanded without releasing an album. * Spencer Sercombe teamed up with German guitar legend Michael Schenker and appeared on the 1992 MSG acoustic album Unplugged Live. In 1993, he recorded the Love Revolution EP with Jamie Rio And Newmatic Slam. He joined the Riverdogs for a European tour in 1994 and collaborated with the band's vocalist Rob Lamothe on his 1996 debut solo album, Gravity. Sercombe and Riverdogs drummer Ronnie Ciago both joined former Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward's solo band although only Ciago appears on the 1997 When the Bough Breaks album. Sercombe also played in a ZZ Top tribute band called Fandango. He later moved to Germany, guesting on Gigantor's 2001 album, 'Back to the Rockets, and singer/guitarist Eddie St. James' 2013 release, Streets Cry Freedom, with whom he has also done shows as an acoustic guitar duo. * Greg Ellis left the band and played in Michael Monroe's band and in Jerusalem Slim, featuring Monroe and guitarist Steve Stevens. They released one self-titled album in 1992. Ellis went on to form world music duo Vas with Iranian born vocalist Azam Ali, releasing a total of 4 albums between 1997 and 2004. He guested on Steve Stevens' 1999 solo album, Flamenco A Go-Go. Ellis has also recorded with Psytrance act Juno Reactor and his own ambient group, Biomusique, who issued 10,000 Steps in 2008. * Chris Heilman has previously been in Torm√© and went on to play guitar with Chromosapien with Doni Castello from Burning Tree on vocals, bassist Dan Rothchild, formerly of Tonic, guitarist Craig McCloskey, and LA session drummer Dan Potruch. * Walt Woodward III joined The Scream and appeared on their Let It Scream debut album before doing a stint with surf guitar legend Dick Dale. Returning to his native New Jersey, he played in various local bands, including The Painkillers. Woodward died June 8, 2010 from liver failure. 2005‚Äì2013: Gathering of the Faithful and new line-up In 2005, Shark Island reunited to re-record various previously-written and demoed songs for the album Gathering of the Faithful, produced by guitarist Spencer Sercombe with additional production from German Villacorta and vocalist Richard Black. The line-up featured Black on vocals, Sercombe on guitars, piano, synthesizer and vocals, Christian Heilman on bass and new drummer, Glen Sobel, now with Alice Cooper. The album was released in Europe on Frontiers Records in 2006 and via Manifest Music in the U.S. in 2007. In 2013, Black put together a new line-up of Shark Island and played classic era material in Europe including a show in Zagreb, Croatia 2019‚Äìpresent: New studio album In 2019, the band released a new studio album, Bloodline. The album was limited to a worldwide print of only 1111 copies. The Shark Island family now consists of Richard Black (vocals), Damir Simic (guitar), Alen Frjlak (drums) and returning Shark Island member Christian Heilmann (bass). Credit is also given to Marko Karacic (bass). Bloodline was produced by Alex Kane mixed by Sylvia Massy. The collection has ten original songs and one cover of \\"Policy of Truth\\" by Depeche Mode.

For U.S. Federal income tax purposes, mark-to-market accounting is used for each 1256 contract as of the end of each tax year, and such contracts are treated as dispositioned (i.e., as \\"closed\\") at year end. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is not clear on whether QQQ, DIA and SPY options should be treated as section 1256 contracts.\\"These final regulations do not provide substantive rules on index options. Rather, to determine whether an index substantially all the components of which are specified securities is a broad-based index under section 1256(g)(6)(B), a broker must look to rules established by the Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission that determine which regulator has jurisdiction over an option on the index.\\" https://www.irs.gov/irb/2013-20_IRB/ar07.html On one hand, these do not settle in cash (most Section 1256 contracts do), but on the other hand they meet the definition of a \\"broad-based\\" index option. Instead, the IRS grants penalty relief if a broker determines in good faith that an index is, or is not, a narrow-based index, following published guidelines. Tax advantages Any gain or loss from a 1256 Contract is treated for tax purposes as 40% short- term gain and 60% long-term gain. Because most futures contracts are held for less than the 12-month minimum holding period for long-term capital gains tax rates, the gain from any non-1256 contract will typically be taxed at the higher short-term rate. Thus the 1256 Contract designation enhances the marketability based on the after-tax attractiveness of these products. The reason for the implementation of section 1256 was the fact that traders were hedging their short term futures contracts (going long and short at the same time) to transition to the next tax year without paying the short-term capital gains tax on these positions, and were effectively making these positions qualify for long-term tax treatment. Section 1256 contract net losses can be carried back three years (instead of being carried forward to the following year), starting with the earliest year, but only to a year in which there is a net Section 1256 contracts gain, and only up to the extent of such gain (the carrying back cannot produce a net operating loss for the year), using Form 1045 or an amended return.

The aim is the study of basic processes or potential therapeutic interventions in this disease, and the extension of the pathophysiological knowledge on and/or the improvement of medical treatment of human ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke has a complex pathophysiology involving the interplay of many different cells and tissues such as neurons, glia, endothelium, and the immune system. These events cannot be mimicked satisfactorily in vitro yet. Thus a large portion of stroke research is conducted on animals. Overview Several models in different species are currently known to produce cerebral ischemia. Global ischemia models, both complete and incomplete, tend to be easier to perform. However, they are less immediately relevant to human stroke than the focal stroke models, because global ischemia is not a common feature of human stroke. However, in various settings global ischemia is also relevant, e.g. in global anoxic brain damage due to cardiac arrest. Different species also vary in their susceptibility to the various types of ischemic insults. An example is gerbils. They do not have a Circle of Willis and stroke can be induced by common carotid artery occlusion alone. Mechanisms of inducing ischemic stroke Some of the mechanisms which have been used are: *Complete global ischemia **Decapitation **Aorta/vena cava occlusion **External neck tourniquet or cuff **Cardiac arrest *Incomplete global ischemia **Hemorrhage or hypotension **Hypoxic ischemia **Intracranial hypertension and common carotid artery occlusion **Two-vessel occlusion and hypotension **Four-vessel occlusion **Unilateral common carotid artery occlusion (in some species only) *Focal cerebral ischemia **Endothelin-1-induced constriction of arteries and veins **Middle cerebral artery occlusion **Spontaneous brain infarction (in spontaneously hypertensive rats) **Macrosphere embolization *Multifocal cerebral ischemia **Blood clot embolization **Microsphere embolization **Photothrombosis Hypoxic Ischemia models One of the most commonly used animal models of hypoxic ischemia was originally described by Levine in 1960 and later refined by Rice et al., in 1981. This approach is useful to study hypoxic ischemia in the developing brain, since newborn rat pups are utilized in this model. Briefly, 7 day old rat pups undergo a permanent unilateral carotid artery ligation with a subsequent 3 hour exposure to a hypoxic environment (8% oxygen). This model creates a unilateral infarct in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the ligation, since the hypoxia alone is subthreshold for injury at this age. The area of injury is typically concentrated in periventricular regions of the brain, especially cortical and hippocampal areas. Focal ischemia models They are divided into techniques including reperfusion of the ischemic tissue (transient focal cerebral ischemia) and those without reperfusion (permanent focal cerebral ischemia). The following models are established : *Endothelin-1 -induced constriction of arteries and veins *Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) **MCAO avoiding craniotomy ***Embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion ***Endovascular filament middle cerebral artery occlusion (transient or permanent) **MCAO involving craniotomy ***Permanent transcranial middle cerebral artery occlusion ***Transient transcranial middle cerebral artery occlusion *Direct tissue damage **Cerebrocortical photothrombosis Endothelin-1 -induced constriction of arteries and veins Endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor which is produced endogenously during ischemic stroke and which contributes to overall loss of cells and disability. Exogenous endothelin-1 can also be used to induce stroke and cell death after sustained vasoconstriction with reperfusion. It can be microinjected to induce focal stroke in small tissue volumes (e.g., cortical grey matter, white matter or subcortical tissue) or after injection near the Middle cerebral artery. It is often used as a model of focal stroke to evaluate candidate pro-regenerative therapies. One advantage of this model of stroke is that it causes highly reproducible infarcts. Another benefit is that it can be used in elderly rats with only very low resulting mortality. Embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion Middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion is achieved in this model by injecting particles like blood clots (thrombembolic MCAO) or artificial spheres into the carotid artery of animals as an animal model of ischemic stroke. Thrombembolic MCAO is achieved either by injecting clots that were formed in vitro or by endovascular instillation of thrombin for in situ clotting . The thrombembolic model is closest to the pathophysiology of human cardioembolic stroke. When injecting spheres into the cerebral circulation, their size determines the pattern of brain infarction: Macrospheres (300‚Äì400 ¬µm) induce infarcts similar to those achieved by occlusion of the proximal MCA , whereas microsphere (~ 50 ¬µm) injection results in distal, diffuse embolism . However, the quality of MCAO ‚Äì and thus the volume of brain infarcts ‚Äì is very variable, a fact which is further aggravated by a certain rate of spontaneous lysis of injected blood clots. Endovascular filament middle cerebral artery occlusion The technique of endovascular filament (intraluminal suture) MCAO as an animal model of ischemic stroke was described first by Koizumi . It is applied to rats and mice. A piece of surgical filament is introduced into the internal carotid artery and forwarded until the tip occludes the origin of the middle cerebral artery, resulting in a cessation of blood flow and subsequent brain infarction in its area of supply. If the suture is removed after a certain interval, reperfusion is achieved (transient MCAO); if the filament is left in place the procedure is suitable as model of permanent MCAO, too. The most common modification is based on Longa (1989) who described filament introduction via the external carotid artery, allowing closure of the access point with preserved blood supply via the common and internal carotid artery to the brain after the removal of the filament. Known pitfalls of this method are insufficient occlusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage , hyperthermia , and necrosis of the ipsilateral extracranial tissue . Filament MCAO is not applicable to all rat strains . Permanent transcranial middle cerebral artery occlusion In this animal model of ischemic stroke the middle cerebral artery (MCA) is surgically dissected and subsequently permanently occluded, e.g. by electrocautery or ligation. Occlusion can be performed on the proximal or distal part of the MCA. In the latter, ischemic damage is restricted to the cerebral cortex. MCAO can be combined with temporal or permanent common carotid artery occlusion. These models require a small craniotomy. Transient transcranial middle cerebral artery occlusion The technique of modeling ischemic stroke by transient transcranial MCAO is similar to that of permanent transcranial MCAO, with the MCA being reperfused after a defined period of focal cerebral ischemia . Like permanent MCAO, craniotomy is required and common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion can be combined. Occluding one MCA and both CCAs is referred to as the three vessel occlusion model of focal cerebral ischemia. Cerebrocortical photothrombosis Photothrombotic models of ischemic stroke use local intravascular photocoagulation of circumscribed cortical areas. After intravenous injection of photosensitive dyes like rose-bengal, the brain is irradiated through the skull via a small hole or a thinned cranial window, leading to photochemical occlusion of the irradiated vessels with secondary tissue ischemia . This approach was initially proposed by Rosenblum and El- Sabban in 1977, and improved by Watson in 1985 in the rat brain. This method has also been adapted for use in mice.

G. Johnson, Notes on Perfectly Matched Layers, online MIT course notes (Aug. 2007). The key property of a PML that distinguishes it from an ordinary absorbing material is that it is designed so that waves incident upon the PML from a non-PML medium do not reflect at the interface‚Äîthis property allows the PML to strongly absorb outgoing waves from the interior of a computational region without reflecting them back into the interior. PML was originally formulated by Berenger in 1994 for use with Maxwell's equations, and since that time there have been several related reformulations of PML for both Maxwell's equations and for other wave-type equations, such as elastodynamics, the linearized Euler equations, Helmholtz equations, and poroelasticity. Berenger's original formulation is called a split-field PML, because it splits the electromagnetic fields into two unphysical fields in the PML region. A later formulation that has become more popular because of its simplicity and efficiency is called uniaxial PML or UPML, in which the PML is described as an artificial anisotropic absorbing material. Although both Berenger's formulation and UPML were initially derived by manually constructing the conditions under which incident plane waves do not reflect from the PML interface from a homogeneous medium, both formulations were later shown to be equivalent to a much more elegant and general approach: stretched- coordinate PML. In particular, PMLs were shown to correspond to a coordinate transformation in which one (or more) coordinates are mapped to complex numbers; more technically, this is actually an analytic continuation of the wave equation into complex coordinates, replacing propagating (oscillating) waves by exponentially decaying waves. This viewpoint allows PMLs to be derived for inhomogeneous media such as waveguides, as well as for other coordinate systems and wave equations. Technical description Specifically, for a PML designed to absorb waves propagating in the x direction, the following transformation is included in the wave equation. Wherever an x derivative \\\\partial/\\\\partial x appears in the wave equation, it is replaced by: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} \\\\to \\\\frac{1}{1 + \\\\frac{i\\\\sigma(x)}{\\\\omega}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} where \\\\omega is the angular frequency and \\\\sigma is some function of x. Wherever \\\\sigma is positive, propagating waves are attenuated because: :e^{i(kx - \\\\omega t)} \\\\to e^{i(kx - \\\\omega t) - \\\\frac{k}{\\\\omega} \\\\int^x \\\\sigma(x') dx'} , where we have taken a planewave propagating in the +x direction (for k > 0) and applied the transformation (analytic continuation) to complex coordinates: x \\\\to x + \\\\frac{i}{\\\\omega} \\\\int^x \\\\sigma(x') dx', or equivalently dx \\\\to dx (1 + i\\\\sigma/\\\\omega). The same coordinate transformation causes waves to attenuate whenever their x dependence is in the form e^{ikx} for some propagation constant k: this includes planewaves propagating at some angle with the x axis and also transverse modes of a waveguide. The above coordinate transformation can be left as-is in the transformed wave equations, or can be combined with the material description (e.g. the permittivity and permeability in Maxwell's equations) to form a UPML description. The coefficient œÉ/œâ depends upon frequency--this is so the attenuation rate is proportional to k/œâ, which is independent of frequency in a homogeneous material (not including material dispersion, e.g. for vacuum) because of the dispersion relation between œâ and k. However, this frequency-dependence means that a time domain implementation of PML, e.g. in the FDTD method, is more complicated than for a frequency- independent absorber, and involves the auxiliary differential equation (ADE) approach (equivalently, i/œâ appears as an integral or convolution in time domain). Perfectly matched layers, in their original form, only attenuate propagating waves; purely evanescent waves (exponentially decaying fields) oscillate in the PML but do not decay more quickly. However, the attenuation of evanescent waves can also be accelerated by including a real coordinate stretching in the PML: this corresponds to making œÉ in the above expression a complex number, where the imaginary part yields a real coordinate stretching that causes evanescent waves to decay more quickly. Limitations of perfectly matched layers PML is widely used and has become the absorbing boundary technique of choice in much of computational electromagnetism. Although it works well in most cases, there are a few important cases in which it breaks down, suffering from unavoidable reflections or even exponential growth. One caveat with perfectly matched layers is that they are only reflectionless for the exact, continuous wave equation. Once the wave equation is discretized for simulation on a computer, some small numerical reflections appear (which vanish with increasing resolution). For this reason, the PML absorption coefficient œÉ is typically turned on gradually from zero (e.g. quadratically) over a short distance on the scale of the wavelength of the wave. In general, any absorber, whether PML or not, is reflectionless in the limit where it turns on sufficiently gradually (and the absorbing layer becomes thicker), but in a discretized system the benefit of PML is to reduce the finite-thickness \\"transition\\" reflection by many orders of magnitude compared to a simple isotropic absorption coefficient. In certain materials, there are \\"backward- wave\\" solutions in which group and phase velocity are opposite to one another. This occurs in \\"left-handed\\" negative index metamaterials for electromagnetism and also for acoustic waves in certain solid materials, and in these cases the standard PML formulation is unstable: it leads to exponential growth rather than decay, simply because the sign of k is flipped in the analysis above. Fortunately, there is a simple solution in a left-handed medium (for which all waves are backwards): merely flip the sign of œÉ. A complication, however, is that physical left-handed materials are dispersive: they are only left-handed within a certain frequency range, and therefore the œÉ coefficient must be made frequency-dependent. Unfortunately, even without exotic materials, one can design certain waveguiding structures (such as a hollow metal tube with a high-index cylinder in its center) that exhibit both backwards- and forwards- wave solutions at the same frequency, such that any sign choice for œÉ will lead to exponential growth, and in such cases PML appears to be irrecoverably unstable. Another important limitation of PML is that it requires that the medium be invariant in the direction orthogonal to the boundary, in order to support the analytic continuation of the solution to complex coordinates (the complex \\"coordinate stretching\\"). As a consequence, the PML approach is no longer valid (no longer reflectionless at infinite resolution) in the case of periodic media (e.g. photonic crystals or phononic crystals)A. F. Oskooi, L. Zhang, Y. Avniel, and S. G.

It comes in cylinders, which have a special gas regulator. The company was formed in 1935, and is one of the UK's largest suppliers of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). It is currently servicing around 4 million homes and businesses, supplying LPG to power gas appliances from central heating and hot water, as well as cookers, fires and barbecues. The company predominantly supplies LPG to homes in rural areas where there is no mains natural gas supply. In the United Kingdom, Calor is part of the SHV Gas Group a private Dutch company. Calor originally dealt only with cooking and heating appliances, but now covers a wider range of products for home, business, and automotive fuels.  History  In 1934, Ritchie Gill, a Cornishman who had been working in the US, returned to England. He spotted an opportunity for a product successfully used in America ‚Äì liquefied petroleum gas. Gill coined the name Calor Gas and in January 1935 he set up Modern Gas & Equipment Co. Ltd, based in London. In August 1935 the trade was transferred to the Calor (Distributing) Co. Limited.Competition Commission Report 1981 The business expanded as people in rural areas of the UK realised the benefits of this new fuel ‚Äì LPG. So by 1939 the company had six offices in the UK: a head office in London and five regional offices.Calor: History Calor (Scotland) had been founded and in Ireland, Calor gas was being distributed by Messrs. McMullen Ltd., which was later purchased by Calor. In 1947, there was an exceptionally hard winter which led to a major change in the way that Calor was distributed. Up to this point Calor had been relying upon rail transport for the distribution of the LPG. Calor signed a contract with PX (Carriers) Ltd., to deliver cylinders by road. The first wholly owned filling plant was built at Saxham, near Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk and a further two filling plants were built in the 1950s to give Calor even wider coverage. These two plants were at Millbrook near Southampton (1956) and Port Clarence near Middlesbrough (1959). The Millbrook filling plant was closed in 2001; however the sales and service centre remains, selling gas and gas appliances. The 1950s saw the introduction of the Flavel B500 cooker, which used Calor gas; it became a great success story with caravan owners and smaller households. 1956 saw the birth of Calor's industrial division and installation of the first 'bulk propane' tank at the Meredith & Drew biscuit factory in Newmarket. In 1963 Calor Ltd. was formed. 1966 saw a new head office being acquired in Slough, which led to over 300 employees moving into this location. In 1967, Calor was granted a Royal Warrant for the supply of liquefied petroleum gas to Her Majesty the Queen. The company was later granted a second Warrant, this time for supplying Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. In 1969 the Imperial Continental Gas Association acquired all the shares in the Company that it did not already own. From the early 1970s onwards sales of cabinet heaters, and with them sales of butane in cylinders, escalated enormously, beginning with Super Ser which rapidly replaced the paraffin heater as the nation's number one choice for spot heating. In a decade, the market for cabinet heaters and the gas they burned grew from nothing to ¬£100 million p.a. This led to increasing demand for storage space, which led to Calor investing in the two largest storage facilities. The first was purchased in 1976: a 30,000 tonne refrigerated storage tank at Felixstowe in Suffolk. The second was a joint venture with Conoco to excavate a vast cavern on South Humberside, capable of containing some 100,000 tonnes of gas supplied from an adjacent sea terminal. This facility, opened in 1985, gave Calor the ability to overcome short-term supply difficulties and to cope with major changes in demand brought on by extremes of weather. During the 1980s, Calor's domestic central heating and industrial markets continued to expand and in 1982 the company's head office moved to a site near Slough. Despite great efforts to establish a nationwide network of outlets, Calor Autogas (vehicle propane) never quite reached expectations, due largely to the Government's inability to recognise its considerable environmental advantages by reducing duty. However, the fuel did become very popular for fork lift trucks, helped greatly by the launch, in 1989, of Calor's exhaust purification system, EPS2000, which enabled vehicles to be used both indoors and outside. In 1986 the company's parent, Imperial Continental Gas Association plc, rejected a bid from Gulf Resources & Chemical Corporation, a company controlled by the Barclay brothers.Imperial Gas New York Times, 23 October 1986 Instead in 1987 Imperial Continental Gas Association broke itself up into Calor Group and Contibel (now owned by Tractebel).Gulf Resources & Chemical Corporation In 1988 the privately owned Dutch company, SHV became a significant shareholder, acquiring 40% of Calor Group's equity. In 1991, a joint venture company involving Calor, SHV and Primagaz (in which SHV holds a 50% stake) had been started in both Poland and Slovakia. This was then followed by Hungary in 1992. In 1997 SHV acquired the rest of Calor's shares. In 2002 Calor opened 12 Customer Operations Centres at Grangemouth, Port Clarence, Stoney Stanton, Elland, Ellesmere Port, Coryton, Cranbrook, Saxham, Fawley, Neath, and Newbury. In December 2005 The Canvey LNG project was announced which commenced with a feasibility study into the development of a strategic LPG import and regasification facility at the existing Calor LNG terminal at Canvey Island, Essex UK. The project is led by Calor Gas and also includes LNG Japan Corporation, (Joint Venture of Sumitomo Corporation and Sojitz Corporation). Following this study Centrica has now been selected as a gas supply partner and would hold equity in the facility, together with capacity rights enabling it to deliver supplies to their British Gas customers from a range of international sources. A full scale planning application and project plan is now being developed.Centrica to fight for Canvey Island LNG  Products  Calor provide gas both for use in bulk tanks (which may be stored above or below ground) and in smaller gas cylinders.  Bulk tanks  Calor can provide a variety of sizes in both above- and below- ground formats. Tanks are available with a monitor, which automatically inform Calor when stocks are low so that the gas can then be refuelled without intervention by the tank's owner.  Gas cylinders  Calor's largest cylinder (47 kg) can be used in packs (4 x 47 kg gas cylinders) which are able to supply central heating systems of up to 60 kW as well as cookers and fires. When one pair runs low the valve automatically switches to the second pair so that the supply is continuous. For leisure use such as caravanning and barbecuing, Calor retail butane, propane and Patio Gas (an alternative brand name for propane) cylinders, all of which come in a number of sizes. A new Calor Lite cylinder, produced from lightweight steel, released in 2008, was targeted at the caravan market. Calor also provides LPG for business customers.  Autogas  Calor is involved in the supply of autogas in the UK and Ireland - LPG intended as a vehicle fuel. There are 115,000 vehicles in the UK that run on LPG, which emits 20% less carbon than petrol,LPG - The benefits and produces 120 times less particulate matter than diesel.WLPGA : Outdoor Air Quality  Calor Village of the Year  Calor fund and organise the Calor Village of the Year competition in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which over 1,000 villages enter every year. Calor is a member of the Business in the Community 'PerCent Club' investing more than 1% of its pre-tax profit in community projects. The first Calor UK Village of the Year 2008 was announced on 2 December 2008 as the Isle of Barra in the Western Isles of Scotland.

He claimed to have covered more than 100,000 miles and visited all states except Hawaii: His goats couldn't swim that far, he said, and if they could, \\"they'd just end up eating the grass skirts off the hula dancers anyway\\". He was a familiar sight to many travelers and vacationers during those years, and one difficult to not notice or remember. The main sources for biographical information about McCartney are McCartney himself and his son, and some of the often-colorful details vary. McCartney was the subject of numerous newspaper articles over the years, many of which are collected in the book 'America's Goat Man (Mr. Ches McCartney). Early years Born around the turn of the twentieth century (the exact year is unknown), McCartney ran away from his family's Iowa farm home at age 14. In New York he met and married a Spanish knife thrower ten years his senior and became part of her act, serving as near-miss target. When she became pregnant they tried to make a living as farmers, but were wiped out at the start of the Great Depression. She left one day before dawn. McCartney married at least two more times. At some point, while working for the WPA cutting timber, an injury from a falling tree left McCartney's left arm twisted. He was initially thought to have died in the accident, but he awakened on a mortician's table as the undertaker inserted an embalming needle in his arm. McCartney had always been fond of goats since his days on the family farm, and he came up with the idea of using a goat cart to travel with his family and work as an itinerant preacher. His wife did not like the idea, and left. One account says that McCartney sold his wife to another farmer for $1,000. Inspirations McCartney was taken with the book Robinson Crusoe, and carried a copy of it, along with a Bible, throughout his travels‚Äîthe only two books he carried. Robinson Crusoe inspired him to dress himself and his son Albert in goat skins. It also possibly inspired or validated his independent lifestyle, in which he lived off the land, the contributions of strangers, and his goats. Travel rig McCartney's iron-wheeled wagon was large, rickety, and garishly decorated with a clutter of objects he found and collected along the road. It contained a bed, a potbellied stove, lanterns, and lots of trash, and was pulled by a team of around nine goats, with a few trailing behind to occasionally push and serve as brakes on downhill stretches of road. His traveling goat herd sometimes numbered up to thirty. The goats were surprisingly sturdy and effective draft animals and McCartney managed to make five to ten miles a day, even pushing up Tennessee's Monteagle Mountain during a winter storm that stalled all other vehicle traffic. He claimed to have survived that cold night by pulling a couple of extra goats into the wagon with him. Kids and doe goats rode in the wagon while bucks did the draft and push work. McCartney kept and cared for his sick and injured goats, including one which had no front legs and had learned to hop on its back legs like a kangaroo. He named all his goats, and one of his favorites, Billy Blue Horns, supposedly lived three decades. The Goat Man usually kept his herd and rig to the sides of the roads he traveled, so while he may have slowed vehicle traffic, he rarely stopped it. Life on the road McCartney's diet consisted mainly of goat milk, supplemented by food given to him or bought with money he made selling scrap metal he collected, postcards of himself, or from posing for pictures. He also accepted donations for his \\"Free Thinking Christian Mission\\" based in Georgia. McCartney had no difficulty attracting attention and visitors as he was friendly, chatty, and quick to share an inspirational sermon. By most accounts he smelled very bad, as did his goats. Each night he camped on some tolerant landowner's property or farmer's field. He milked and fed his goats and built a large campfire that he always topped off with an automobile tire. This added acridity to the fragrance of the bivouac, but McCartney claimed the smoke effectively kept the bugs away. There were rumors that he was rich, and legends about how it was bad luck to harm him. These didn't protect him from being mugged with increasing frequency in later years on the road. Later years After retiring from the road, McCartney and his son Albert Gene McCartney lived in a rusted old school bus in Twiggs County near Jeffersonville, Georgia, after the wooden shack they had been living in burned. Also on the property were an outhouse and a concrete \\"tomb\\" that supposedly housed the bodies of his father and stepmother. There was no running water or electricity. McCartney became infatuated with the actress Morgan Fairchild and returned to the road in 1984 to hitchhike to California, ostensibly to woo her. He was mugged soon after arriving in Los Angeles, and that ended his road adventures. Cormac McCarthy's 1979 novel Suttree, set in Knoxville, Tennessee, features a character based on McCartney. Beginning in 1987 Ches McCartney lived out his late years in a nursing home in Macon, Georgia. In June 1998, he was given tragic news that his son (a character study in his own right) had been found shot to death on the Twiggs County property. McCartney requested that his son be buried in the tomb there, but it was found to be in disrepair. The city of Jeffersonville donated a cemetery plot to the McCartneys, and Albert Gene was buried there. The murder remains unsolved. Less than six months after his son's death, Ches McCartney died. He was believed to be in his late nineties, but he had claimed to be 106. References * Patton, Darryl. America's Goat Man (Mr. Ches McCartney).

Founded in 1983, UAT integrates technology into its general education requirements. The institution offers core classes (e.g., Legal Issues in Technology, Technology and Society, Ethics in Technology), as well as deep sets of courses in each major. Each student is required to complete a \\"Student Innovation Project\\" and internship to graduate. UAT offers Associate, Bachelor's and Master's degrees, on campus and online. The school has an enrollment of approximately 1000 students. UAT also participates in a student exchange with DeMontfort University, UK. History Founded in 1983, the University of Advancing Technology was first known as CAD Institute, a small school focused on training engineers and architects in the then new field of computer-aided design. Students came to CAD Institute seeking professional development training and certifications. The institution received accreditation in 1987 by the Accrediting Council for Continuing Education and Training (ACECT) at the diploma and occupational associate's level. In 1992, CAD Institute founded an initial research center, the Computer Reality Center. The center primarily performed research for the computer graphics industry, with specific emphasis on the field of virtual reality. The institute also shifted to a new accrediting agency, the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS), which certified it as a college. In 1996, CAD Institute was accredited as a four-year institution. That same year, the institute began offering educational programs outside the CAD focus. In order to reflect the broadened technology focus of students within the institution, the CAD name was retired in 1997 and the institution was renamed the University of Advancing Computer Technology (UACT). Associated with a growth in programs and the student body, the institution designed and built a technology-oriented campus in 1998 in Tempe, Arizona. The building features classrooms, computer labs and computing commons outfitted with approximately 300 computer workstations and an extensive technology infrastructure. Also in 1998, UACT received approval from ACICS to offer a Master of Science in Technology degree. In 2000, it received approval to offer online courses. The institution made another incremental change in its name in 2002, when it became the University of Advancing Technology (UAT) to recognize that computer technology had evolved beyond the personal computer to encompass all devices that communicate, manage information, and provide connections through all media, including the Internet. In 2003, UAT offered its first online bachelor's degree in game design. In the fall of 2007, housing facilities for 260 students were opened on campus. That same year, UAT became a candidate with The Higher Learning Commission and an affiliate of the North Central Association. In recognition of the quality of its Network Security program, the university was also designated a Center of Academic Excellence by the National Centers of Information Assurance Education (CAEIAE) sponsored by the U.S. National Security Agency and the Homeland Security Department. Academics UAT offers associate, bachelor's, and master's degree programs. There are 20 different undergraduate majors and 5 areas of study at the graduate level, with focus on technology innovation, video game design and programming, digital media, robotics, cyber security, and computer science. Accreditations, authorizations, and approvals In 2009, UAT became accredited by The Higher Learning Commission and a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. to award associate degrees, bachelor's degrees and master's degrees.

The highway extends from Route 54 in Hammonton to U.S. Route 9 (US 9) in Bass River Township. Route description CR 542 begins at an intersection with Route 54 in Hammonton, Atlantic County, heading east on two-lane undivided Central Avenue. The road passes through wooded residential areas, intersecting CR 724 and CR 680. Near Atlanticare - Kessler Memorial Hospital, the route intersects US 30, at which point CR 542 turns south for a brief concurrency on four-lane undivided White Horse Pike. Near Hammonton Lake, CR 542 splits from US 30 by heading east on two-lane undivided Hammonton-Pleasant Mills Road, soon intersecting CR 679. The road continues through a mix of homes and farms, turning northeast and entering Mullica Township, where CR 542 curves east again and passes through woods as it reaches a junction with CR 693. From this point, the route continues back into agricultural areas with some homes, meeting CR 658. CR 542 turns northeast and enters the Wharton State Forest, a part of the Pine Barrens. After passing to the north of Nescochague Lake, the road reaches the CR 623 junction.

He operated on the Rhine frontier near Trier. According to Zosimus, Charietto saw barbarian raiders crossing the Rhine and determined to take action. Going out into the forest at night he would kill a number of the raiders, sever their heads and bring them into the town come daytime. Charietto was joined by other men, and eventually their success earned him the admiration of Julian, who was commander in the region and later became the Emperor known as Julian the Apostate. Charietto was encouraged by Julian to attack the barbarian raiders at night, while Roman regular forces would confront them by day. After a long period of such activities, the raiders surrendered. Ammianus Marcellinus, the other major chronicler for the life of the Emperor Julian, also refers to a figure named Charietto, in this case a Roman general who was killed resisting an excursion by the Alamanni. While there is no conclusive evidence linking this individual with Charietto the head-hunter, some scholars have assumed a connection.  External links  *C. M.

Some types of livestock, coal, timber and domestic iron ore are also included. It does not include: inventory; property held for sale in the ordinary course of business; artistic creations held by their creator; or, government publications.IRS publication History The 1954 version of the Internal Revenue Code included section 1231 covering certain property held by a business.\\"Section 1231(a) and Uncompensated Losses. A Casualty of Statutory Interpretation?\\" A. D. P. Virginia Law Review, Vol. 52, No. 1. (Jan., 1966), pp. 89-116 The original section covering this matter - namely, section 117(j) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 - was enacted in 1942.Subsection (j) of section 117 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, enacted by subsection (b) of section 151 of the Revenue Act of 1942, Ch. 619, 56 Stat. 798, 846 (Oct. 21, 1942). The law was originally conceived as a way to help the shipping industry during World War II. The present version of the Internal Revenue Code has retained section 1231, with the provision now applying to both property lost in an involuntary conversion, and to the sale or exchange of certain kinds of business-use property. Application A taxpayer can calculate net 1231 gains and losses, often referred to as the hotchpot, as capital gains, with the caveat that if the gain is less than any ‚Äúnon-recaptured losses‚Äù from the preceding five years, it is re-characterized as ordinary income and is reported with Form 4797. ‚ÄúNon-recaptured loss‚Äù is covered by 1231(c). This provision refers to a situation when a taxpayer claims a 1231 loss in year one, but seeks a 1231 gain in any of subsequent years two through six. Any gain which is less than or equal to the loss in year one will be characterized as ordinary income rather than long-term capital gain (which has preferred tax rates). Gains and losses under 1231 due to casualty or theft are set aside in what is often referred to as the fire-pot (tax). These gains and losses do not enter the hotchpot unless the gains exceed the losses. If the result is a gain, both the gain and loss enter the hotchpot and are calculated with any other 1231 gains and losses. If there are more casualty loss(es) than gains, the excess is treated as an ordinary loss. Impact Section 1231 treatment allows taxpayers to enjoy tax-favored treatment for 1231 property gains that are greater than 1231 property losses. This means that if the asset can be sold for a value greater than its basis, it can be taxed at a capital gains rate, which is lower than an ordinary income rate. However, if the 1231 property results in a loss then the taxpayer can treat it as an ordinary loss and such a loss may reduce the taxpayer's taxable income. This provision is said to give a taxpayer the \\"best of both worlds\\" as it allows the favorable capital gains tax rate on section 1231 property while avoiding the negative implications of capital loss treatment. Ordinary losses are 100% deductible, while capital losses are subject to an annual deduction limitation of $3,000 against ordinary income. Within this framework, if capital losses exceed capital gains by more than $3,000 in any given tax year, the portion of the deduction that may be used to offset ordinary income is limited to $3,000; the excess loss over $3,000 must be carried over to the following year. C Corporations are not allowed to deduct capital losses against ordinary income, and must instead deduct capital losses only against capital gains. If capital losses exceed capital gains in any given tax year, the excess loss may be carried back three years and carried forward five years where it is offset against capital gains of those years. When carrying a C corporation's capital loss back or forward, the loss does not retain its character as short-term or long-term. In other words, the loss is treated as a short-term capital loss even if it was originally a long-term capital loss. Section 1231 does not reclassify property as a capital asset. Instead, it allows the taxpayer to treat net gains on 1231 property as capital gains, but to treat net losses on such property as ordinary losses. Congress has decided not to let this \\"best of both worlds\\" treatment give taxpayers undesired benefits beyond its purpose. This treatment would compel a taxpayer to sell a Section 1231 loss asset at the end of a year to get an ordinary loss and hold a Section 1231 gain until the next taxable year to receive capital gains treatment. To limit the impact of this undesired result, Congress included 1231(c). This is a controversial topic in U.S. taxation. Under 1231(c), the 1231 gain that was deferred until the second year in the example above will be recharacterized as ordinary income. This is done because the taxpayer has already received the benefit of having the loss in year one treated as an ordinary loss. Thus, if the 1231 gain is disposed of after year one, but before what becomes the seventh year under 1231(c)(2)(A), it will receive ordinary income treatment. If held onto and disposed of after the seventh year, it may be treated as a capital gain.

It is predominantly occupied by students at Durham University who favour the area due to its proximity to the university departments in the Elvet and Palace Green areas of the city. Local amenities Crossgate boasts two pubs (Ye Olde Elm Tree and The Angel), a working men's club and a pancake cafe, all of which exist as part of a cheerful community housed in pretty late Victorian brick terraced houses. St Margaret's Church, built in the 12th century, stands on a small bluff at the foot of Crossgate; its churchyard, extending from South Street up to Margery Lane, provides a significant green space in the Crossgate quarter of Durham. History Crossgate is one of the oldest centres of Durham.M. Bonney, Lordship and the Urban Community: Durham and Its Overlords, 1250-1540 (Cambridge, 1990), pp. 29-30, 43 In the Middle Ages, there was a borough separate from the borough of Durham, called Crossgate or Old Borough, and comprising Crossgate itself, Allergate and South Street; it was more or less coterminous with the chapelry of St Margaret of Antioch. It was under the lordship of Durham Priory and had its own borough court, but had no market of its own.Records of the Borough of Crossgate, Durham, 1312-1531, ed. Richard Britnell, Surtees Society 312 (Durham, 2008), pp. xvii-xxxvi Crossgate was first joined to the main centre of Durham, where the markets were held, when Bishop Flambard built Framwellgate Bridge, about the year 1128.N.

The station stands split across Hoscar Moss Road. Only 1,060 passenger journeys started or ended at Hoscar in 2014/15. 8 trains a day call on weekdays in each direction, all provided by Northern Trains, who also manage the station.  History  The station was built by the Manchester and Southport Railway and opened c.1871, and from January 1885 was part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;). The L&YR; amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922 and in turn was grouped into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923. Nationalisation followed in 1948. When Sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Regional Railways until the privatisation of British Rail. The station once boasted a goods yard which was used by local farmers to get their crops to the markets of Wigan, Manchester and Southport quickly. The former railway tavern is now a house In May 2019 Network Rail installed red light safety enforcement (RLSE) cameras at the station's level crossing to catch motorists flouting the crossing when the lights are on. The cameras were installed as the level crossing is an automatic half barrier (AHB) type this is part of an effort by network rail to improve the safety of such crossings across the UK. Facilities Hoscar has similar amenities to neighbouring New Lane and Bescar Lane, with no permanent buildings other than simple shelters (the old station house is still extant, but in private ownership) and staggered platforms either side of an automatic level crossing. it is unmanned and has no ticket machine, so all tickets have to be purchased on the train or prior to travel.

It is a broad band of cardiac muscle that passes from the right atrium, between the superior vena cava and the ascending aorta. Bachmann's bundle is, during normal sinus rhythm, the preferential path for electrical activation of the left atrium. It is therefore considered to be part of the \\"atrial conduction system\\" of the heart. History In 1916, Jean George Bachmann conducted canine experiments. He found that clamping the muscular bundle of fibers that connects the atria caused a significant conduction delay. Structure The Bachman's bundle receives its blood supply from the sinoatrial nodal artery (right, left or both). Besides Bachmann's bundle, the other three conduction tracts that constitute the atrial conduction system are known as the anterior, middle, and posterior tracts, which run from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node, converging in the region near the coronary sinus. Atrial automaticity foci are within the atrial conduction system. The concentration of converging conduction tracts near the coronary sinus results in considerable automaticity activity originating in that area. Function The normal cardiac rhythm originates in the sinoatrial node, which is located in the right atrium near the superior vena cava. From there, the electrical activation spreads throughout the right atrium. There are at least four different locations where the activation can pass to the left atrium. Apart from Bachmann's bundle these are the anterior interatrial septum, posterior interatrial septum, and the coronary sinus. Because it originates close to the sinoatrial node and consists of long parallel fibers, Bachmann's bundle is, during sinus rhythm, the first of these connections to activate the left atrium.

Route description View north along CR 541 at Route 206 in Shamong The divided portion of CR 541 north of Mount Holly CR 541 begins at an intersection with US 206 in Shamong Township, Burlington County, heading northwest on two-lane undivided Stokes Road. The road passes through forested areas before intersecting, entering a mix of farms and homes. The route reaches a junction with CR 648 before crossing CR 534. CR 541 continues through wooded areas with a few farm fields before heading into forested areas with a few residences. The route briefly joins with CR 620 as it crosses into Medford and intersects CR 622. CR 541 eventually forms the border between Medford to the west and Medford Lakes to the east before fully entering Medford Lakes as it continues through forested residential subdivisions to the west of Aetna Lake. After a junction with the western terminus of CR 532, the route gains a center left-turn lane and borders Medford Lakes to the west and Medford to the east before fully entering Medford again as it passes businesses, with a four-lane stretch near the Jackson Road intersection. The road narrows to two lanes and passes a few farms before coming into the residential and commercial downtown of Medford, where CR 541 becomes Main Street. The route crosses Route 70, at which point it becomes Medford-Mount Holly Road and passes residential areas as it reaches the CR 616 junction. CR 541 continues through a mix of farmland, woodland, and some homes as it crosses into Lumberton Township. Here, the road intersects CR 636 and CR 612 before coming near a few residential subdivisions as it comes to the CR 640 and CR 641 junctions, with the road name changing to Main Street. CR 541 southbound past CR 635 in Burlington Township CR 541 passes near woods and homes before splitting from Main Street by turning west onto four-lane undivided Mount Holly-Lumberton Road, with CR 691 continuing north on Main Street toward Mount Holly. The road turns north and becomes a divided highway as it passes through industrial areas and comes to an intersection with Route 38. After this, the route enters Hainesport Township and passes more industry before crossing Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Pemberton Industrial Track railroad line and CR 537. The road turns northwest and then northeast through wooded areas and crosses into Mount Holly Township. After crossing the Rancocas River, the route intersects CR 626 and heads north past residential neighborhoods. Upon intersecting CR 691 again, CR 541 turns northwest onto Burlington-Mount Holly Road, a four-lane divided highway that has intersections with jughandles. The route enters Westampton Township and crosses CR 630, where it heads into agricultural areas with some businesses, meeting CR 638. CR 541 comes to an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike and intersects CR 637 a short distance later. From this point, the road becomes a six-lane divided highway and crosses into Burlington Township, where it heads into businesses areas, passing the former Burlington Center Mall. The route comes to a cloverleaf interchange with I-295 and narrows back to four lanes, passing more businesses. At the CR 634 intersection, CR 541 narrows into an undivided road that passes a mix of residences and commercial establishments, becoming Mount Holly Road before intersecting CR 635. At this point, the route turns north onto High Street, a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane that runs through residential areas as it comes into Burlington. After the CR 632 junction, CR 541 becomes a four-lane undivided road that passes businesses before coming to its northern terminus at US 130. High Street continues north from here into downtown Burlington.  History  From Mount Holly to Medford, the road was once maintained by the Mount Holly, Lumberton, and Medford Turnpike, chartered in 1854. The road from Mount Holly to Burlington was once maintained by the Mount Holly and Burlington Turnpike, chartered in 1857.

It is currently operated by Northern Trains.  History  The station was built by the Manchester and Southport Railway as a branch of the East Lancashire Railway on 9 April 1855. It radically altered the village, allowing workers to live in Parbold and commute to urban areas throughout the North West. The railway station also provided a natural centre for the village which it still is today. It was absorbed by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;) in 1859. The main stone-built station building (still in use) was built during this time, in the standard L&YR; style. Parbold railway station then became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When Sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Regional Railways until the privatisation of British Rail. The station has retained its L&YR; signal box, which operates the adjacent barrier level crossing. In 2005 the railway station underwent a ¬£250,000 restoration project which saw the ticket office restored to its former glory and new fences and CCTV installed. Facilities The station is staffed on a part-time basis, with the ticket office open from 06:30 to 11:00 on weekdays only (closed Saturdays and Sundays). At other times, tickets must be purchased prior to travel or on the train. Train running information can be obtained from timetable posters and by phone. There are shelters on both platforms and step-free access is available to each one.Parbold station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 19 December 2016  Name  The station was originally named Newburgh after the nearest large village (Newburgh) but this became Newburgh for Parbold and then Parbold for Newburgh. At this point Dalton wanted to also to be mentioned in the official name so the railway company decided to just call the station Parbold (this happened before 1910 as the station was called Parbold in the Bradshaw of that date). At one point however the station was again renamed as Parbold for Newburgh (see 1960s and 1980s British Railway timetables.) Finally in 1973 the station became once again plain Parbold. Services On Monday to Saturday daytimes, there are two trains an hour westbound to Southport and eastbound to Wigan. Beyond here, services run via alternately to via Manchester Victoria and to Stockport and via Manchester Piccadilly. Only a limited number now run via , mainly at peak times and late evenings (travellers to these destinations and for stations along the Calder Valley line now need to change at Wigan).

The tip marks the meeting point of the South China Sea and Sulu Sea.  Geology  The tip as part of the Kudat Peninsula was form through the Kudat formation in the Early Miocene age. The Kudat formation is divided into three major lithological unit, namely the lower, middle and upper units based on significant changes in the composition of the sediments. The lower unit consisted mostly of sandstone and mudstone with the sandy beds predominating, the middle unit consisted of sandstone and mudstone with some occurrence of limestone beds and lenses, and the upper unit consisted of sandstone and mudstone of various proportions mainly in the southern part of the Peninsula.  History  Inscription on the tip history. Inscription on the Chinese reference on the area. The original name of Tanjung Sampang Mangazou comes from the language of the indigenous Rungus, an ethnic group which resides mainly in the district of Kudat. The words Tanjung (cape), Sampang (union) and Mangazou (battle) refers to this location of a battle that occurred when the ethnic Rungus defended their territory against the attack from Moro Pirates. According to legend, this place was a favourite landing point for the pirates. Local Chinese people referring the place as Den Foh Liew, which in Hakka means \\"lighthouse\\" due to a lighthouse on a nearby island of Kalampunian Island can be seen from here. The lighthouse also serves as a reminder of treacherous coastline and past shipwrecks since during the Chinese dynasties era of Song, Ming and Qing, many Chinese trading vessels were capsized while on their way to Celebes Islands, to reach Moluccas (which is known as the Spice Islands). During the famous circumnavigation era, Ferdinand Magellan fleet supposedly went here to perform repairs on his ships.  Features  The tip is one of Sabah's popular tourist attractions. Within the area, there is a park-like grounds with a Malaysian flag pole and a large bronze globe which opened since 2004. The bronze globe marks the location of the Borneo Island tip at latitude 7 degrees north and longitude 116 degrees east with a map featuring the island embossed in bronze and laid on a flat surface at an angle with inscriptions to mark the tip. Over the years, several infrastructure and public amenities have been erected at the site which including a public rest area with a caf√©, souvenir shop and washrooms.

Development While the Vought VE-7s were serving the Navy well in the early 1920s, they were not originally designed as fighters. The Naval Aircraft Factory came up with a simple design driven by a Lawrance J-1 air-cooled radial engine. Its boxy fuselage was suspended between the upper and lower wings (essentially having both dorsal and ventral sets of cabane struts), with the center area of the lower wing enlarged to accommodate a fuel tank.Lloyd S. Jones, U.S. Naval Fighters (Fallbrook CA: Aero Publishers, 1977, ), pp. 14-17 The NAF provided Curtiss with the plans to build the aircraft, and the result, designated TS-1, arrived at Anacostia on May 9, 1922. The TS-1 from Curtiss was delivered with wheels, so the NAF also designed wooden floats to enable their use on vessels other than aircraft carriers. Testing went well, and in late 1922 the Navy ordered 34 planes from Curtiss, with the first arriving on board the aircraft carrier in December. The NAF built another five themselves, as a test of relative costs, as well as four more used to experiment with water-cooled inline engines. Two all-metal versions of the aircraft, F4C-1s, were developed by Curtiss. This aircraft made its first flight on September 4, 1924. The wings had tubular spars and stamped duraluminum ribs, the fuselage was constructed of duraluminum tubing in a Warren truss form. Compared to the TS-1, the lower wing was raised to the base of the fuselage. The F4C-1 was armed with two machine guns and was powered by a 200 hp nine-cylinder Wright J-3 radial. Operational history In addition to operating from the carrier deck, the TS-1s served for several years in floatplane configuration aboard destroyers, cruisers, and battleships. The aircraft were slung over the side by crane. Squadron VO-1 operated this way from 1922, and VF-1 flew its float- equipped TS-1s from battleships in 1925 and 1926.\\"United States Navy Aircraft Since 1911\\" by Gordon Swanborough & Peter M. Bowers (Naval Institute Press Annapolis, MD, ) 1976, 546 pp. The TS-1 was not universally liked by its crews. Positioning of the lower wing below the fuselage resulted in short wheel struts.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 647. The village is situated on the A607 road, south from Lincoln and north-west from Sleaford, and between the villages of Leadenham and Wellingore. To the east lies the course of Ermine Street, now the Viking Way. Castle Hill The village church is St Chad's, part of the Loveden Deanery of the Diocese of Lincoln. The village public house is the Joiners Arms. At Castle Hill to the north of the village are the earthwork remains of Welbourn Castle, a medieval ringwork. The site was purchased in 1998 by Welbourn Parish Council, with the help of a grant from the Heritage Memorial Fund, and is now maintained as a scheduled monument and community open space. Memorial to Field Marshal Sir William Robertson (1860-1933) in the parish church In 1598 Francis Trigge, Rector of Welbourn, arranged for a library to be set up in the room over the south porch of St Wulfram's Church, Grantham for the use of the clergy and the inhabitants of the town; the Francis Trigge Chained Library is claimed as the first public library. The anti-slavery campaigner and academic Peter Peckard was born in the village, the son of the Rev. John Peckard. Field Marshal Sir William Robertson, who served in the First World War, was born in Welbourn. The village secondary school, Sir William Robertson Academy, is named after Robertson.

She is a fictional character from DC Comics' Supergirl series. The character first appeared in Supergirl #1,000,000, created by Peter David and Dusty Abell. Fictional character biography When Linda Danvers tried to take the place of pre-Crisis Kara Zor-El, she unknowingly won the heart of the pre-Crisis version of Superman. The two married, and had a daughter named Ariella Kent (R'E'L in Kryptonian). When Spectre came to send Linda back to the post-Crisis era, and return the pre-Crisis to its original state (and replace her with Kara), Linda agreed on the condition that Ariella would be spared. The Spectre agreed to her terms, and when all traces of Linda Danvers' existence were wiped from the pre-Crisis era, Ariella was left alone to wander the universe. Possessing incredible powers at the very tender age of 6, Ariella began to play in space, unknowingly causing massive devastation. Her ability to time-travel carried her to the 853rd century, where she saved a planet from destruction by playing with the invaders (and accidentally destroying all of their ships and weapons). She became very attached to alien refugee, Dura, who had been fleeing from her, since she had nearly destroyed his planet. She called him \\"Daddy\\" (he called her \\"R'E'L, the Destroyer of Worlds\\"), and he was able to use her affection to exert some degree of control over her, and keep the universe safe. Ariella appears in the 853rd century. Later, she time-traveled to the post-Crisis era, shortly after the \\"Sins of Youth\\" storyline, and met her newest playmate, Klarion the Witch Boy (who seemed smitten with the 6-and-a half year old powerhouse). Her whereabouts are unknown, but it is assumed she is still having adventures somewhere. Powers and abilities A hybrid of metahuman/Kryptonian heritage, Ariella possesses vast powers for her young age. She has incredible superhuman strength and speed. She can fly, travel through time at will, move objects via telekinesis, and teleport anywhere she wishes. She is invulnerable, and ages at an extremely slow rate, energy blasts, energy absorption and also duplication. She also has X-ray vision and heat vision. Due to her high level of power and young age, Ariella can be highly destructive, as she has not learned to hold back her abilities. Post-Infinite Crisis According to an interview with Newsarama, following the events of Infinite Crisis, Didio stated that the Matrix Supergirl was wiped from existence. However, Geoff Johns later stated in 2006 \\"As for this‚Ä¶huh? Linda Danvers hasn't been retconned out at all.\\" The Linda Danvers character was used in the 2008 comic Reign in Hell, but the existence of Ariella in current canon has yet to be established.

It was founded in 1978 as a purpose-built 11‚Äì18 comprehensive and sixth form. It was opened in September 1978. The school is a designated academy and Training School which has also been accredited with both Sportsmark and Artsmark awards.  House system  Pupils are sorted into four houses: Arley, Capesthorne, Moreton and Tatton. Each year, the houses compete for the house cup- which is awarded at the end of each school term. All siblings (Brothers and Sisters) shall be housed together. Each house is led by a member of staff, a Head of House, who manage and care for the students in their house. The current Heads of Houses are: *Arley ‚Äî Mrs Sue Holt *Tatton ‚Äî Mr Patrick Hogg *Moreton ‚Äî Mr Mike Henshall *Capesthorne ‚Äî Mrs Ann Bentley  OFSTED  The most recent Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (OFSTED) report concluded as follows: This very effective school provides excellent value for money. Its success is based on exceptionally strong leadership, much very good teaching and the very good attitudes of the overwhelming majority of the pupils. The achievement of all groups of pupils is very good. Pupils make very good progress in most subjects and overall results in National Curriculum tests and GCSE and A-level examinations are well above average.http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/oxedu_reports/download/(id)/89033/(as)/111428_310596.pdf  Expansion and development Since it first opened over 40 years ago, HCCS's pupil population has grown enormously, leading to considerable expansion of the school buildings. In the last five years, a new Arts building was opened, as was an extension to the science department, and a complete refurbishment of all the science rooms was completed during the summer of 2007. Partially funded by donations and sponsorship from parents and local businesses, the Arts building is home to the art and music faculties, along with a number of rooms dedicated to Sixth Form use on the first floor including a common room, and other 'A level only' courses such as sociology and photography. They are looking into another extension which is intended to boost the number of intakes. In September 2006 a new dining hall facility was completed. This building helped to resolve the problem of over-crowding at lunchtime, allowing lunch to be served in two sittings, rather than four. It also houses a dedicated 'bistro' for the use of Sixth Form pupils, which currently provides food in the mornings, which ends after lunch. A cashless system for dining came into action on 29 January 2007 using cards, and that has since been updated for some years to bio-metric thumbprints, to help solve the problem of lost cards. Finally, from the start of the school year in September 2012, the school will no longer have independent heads of year who follow their year group through the school, instead adopting a house system of four houses led by a head of house. The four houses are; Capesthorn, Arley, Morton and Tatton. In 2013, the sixth form/arts block was redeveloped, also expanding the sixth form building. Temporary buildings were installed on the site for use as teaching facilities for the 6th form during the building period due to the structural defects discovered in the original facility.http://moderngov.cheshireeast.gov.uk/ecminutes/documents/s22510/13%200506C.pdf In 2016, the Arts building was demolished and has been replaced with a building which boasts its own theatre. The sixth form also resides in this building, with a large amount of teaching rooms, a large common room and a quiet study area. It also has its own cafe which is only for students in year 12 and 13, as well as teachers.

Synopsis The film, referred to as \\"A Cine- Radio Revue\\" in its original publicity, is a lavish musical film revue and was Britain's answer to the Hollywood revues which had been produced by the major studios in the United States, such as Paramount on Parade (1930) and The Hollywood Revue of 1929. The revue has a slim storyline about it being a television broadcast. The film consists of 19 comedy and music vignettes linked by running jokes of an aspiring Shakespearean actor and technical problems with a viewer's TV set. Production background Among Hitchcock's contributions was the comic linking segments about a man trying to \\"tune in\\" the revue on his television set, but always failing to get the picture for long because of his needless tinkering. In the UK, John Logie Baird's work in mechanical television in the 1920s made television a topical subject at the time. The film's ensemble numbers were staged by Andr√© Charlot, Paul Murray and Jack Hulbert. Imitating the lavish use of Technicolor by Hollywood studios at that time, four sequences in the film were coloured by the Path√©color process, which used stencils to tint selected areas of the black and white prints. In their book Film's musical moment, Ian Conrich and Estella Tincknell write: :\\"The British equivalent of Hollywood's all-star revues was Elstree Calling (1930), produced by British International Pictures (BIP), which consisted mainly of musical and comedy items from stage shows of the day introduced by comp√®re Tommy Handley. Lacking the lavish production values and visual spectacle of its Hollywood equivalents, Elstree Calling is now something of a curio item interesting chiefly for two reasons: Alfred Hitchcock (then contracted to BIP) was... employed on the production; and the film is quite possibly the first ever to refer directly to television (the linking narrative concerns a television broadcast of the revue, some six years before the BBC began regular television transmissions).\\"Ian Conrich, Estella Tincknell, Film's musical moments, Publ.

The station is north-west of Wigan Wallgate on the Manchester- Southport Line. The station is in Lancashire, but it is supported by the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive and as such within the GMPTE ticketing zone. It is operated by Northern Trains. The main stone-built station building survives adjacent to the Wigan-bound platform, but is now a public house; there are modest shelters on both platforms for rail travellers. History The station was built by the Manchester and Southport Railway and opened on 9 April 1855. From January 1885 it was part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;). The main stone-built station building (no longer in use) was built during that time, in the standard L&YR; style. The L&YR; amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922, and this, in turn, was grouped into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923. Nationalisation followed in 1948. When sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Regional Railways until the privatisation of British Rail. A Greater Manchester Council landfill site and transfer terminal was formerly located a short distance west of the station, served by a siding connection from the up (eastbound) line. This received regular trainloads of domestic waste from terminals in and around Manchester from the early 1980s until 1995, when the site reached capacity and was closed. The defunct siding is still intact and is visible from passing trains. Facilities The station is unmanned, but there is a ticket machine provided to allow passengers to buy prior to travel or collect pre-paid tickets. Train running information can be obtained by phone and timetable posters. There is step-free access to both platforms from the nearby road bridge via ramps.Appley Bridge station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 20 December 2016 Services On Monday to Saturday daytimes, there are two trains an hour westbound to Southport and eastbound to Wigan.

He married Luisa Isabel Lopez y Bru ‚Äîa daughter of Antonio L√≥pez y L√≥pez first Marquis of Comillas, in 1871 and the couple had ten children. One of G√ºell's daughters, Isabel G√ºell i L√≥pez, became a noted composer. Biography G√ºell was born in Barcelona and was the son of Joan G√ºell i Ferrer, a wealthy industrialist from Torredembarra who had amassed considerable riches during his stay in Cuba and thanks to the numerous activities established at his return in Barcelona. His mother, Francesca Bacigalupi I Dolcer, was a member of an ancient merchant family from Genoa who had moved to Catalonia in the late 18th century. G√ºell took over his father's business, which was predominantly in textiles, and added to the family's wealth. G√ºell met the young architect, Antoni Gaudi, following a visit to the World Fair held in Paris in 1878, where he had seen Gaudi's work at the Spanish Pavilion. The pair become lifelong friends and associates and found that they had mutual interests, including religion (both were devout Catholics). G√ºell became a 'Mediciesque' patron to architect Antoni Gaud√≠. Their many collaborations began at the start of Gaudi's career, when G√ºell saw Gaud√≠ as the man who could provide him with uniquely designed buildings. Among G√ºell's early commissions for the aspiring architect were the Bodega G√ºell (winery) at Garraf, the Pabellones Guell de Pedralbes and Park G√ºell which was originally the G√ºell family home and only later bequeathed to the state. In 1890, G√ºell moved his textile factory from Sants to Santa Coloma de Cervello, south of Barcelona. There he established a worker's colony along the lines of the British worker's colonies which had been built in the late nineteenth century. The colony or village at Santa Coloma, now known as Colonia G√ºell, was built with high socialist ideals; homes with larger than average rooms, wide windows and good ventilation so that the textile workers and their families could enjoy comfortable living conditions. The village was to be relatively self-contained and included shops, cafes, a theatre, library and a school (only for boys). In 1890, Gaudi was commissioned to build a church and crypt on the hill overlooking the village.http://www.gaudicoloniaguell.org/en However, G√ºell ran into financial difficulties and the project was eventually abandoned. In spite of its unfinished status, the work is a masterpiece and demonstrates many of Gaudi's signature architectural devices including catenary arches and tessellated finishes. The village, which is still fully operational boasts many fine examples of modernist architecture. Reportedly on one occasion Gaud√≠ said to G√ºell, \\"Sometimes I think we are the only people who like this architecture.\\" G√ºell replied, \\"I don't like your architecture, I respect it.\\"youtube in 1900, G√ºell bought land in Gracia, Barcelona and employed Gaud√≠ to build an estate for the rich. At that time, the area was considered to be remote and the project failed to realize commercial success. Only two houses were built. In 1923, the G√ºell family gave the land to the city, as Park G√ºell. King Alfonso XIII ennobled Eusebi G√ºell as count in 1908. He died in his house in Park G√ºell in 1918.

It is part of the Montijo District of that province. History Coiba separated from continental Panama about 12,000 to 18,000 years ago when sea levels rose. Plants and animals on the new island became isolated from mainland populations and over the millennia most animals have diverged in appearance and behaviour from their mainland counterparts. The island is home to many endemic subspecies, including the Coiba Island howler monkey, the Coiba agouti and the Coiba spinetail. Coiba was home to the Coiba Cacique Indians until about 1560, when they were conquered by the Spanish and forced into slavery. In 1919 a penal colony was built on the island and during the years that Panama was under the dictatorships of Omar Torrijos and Manuel Noriega, the prison on Coiba was a feared place with a reputation for brutal conditions, extreme tortures, executions and political murder. Nobody knows exactly how many people were killed in the prison during this period, but sources claim that the number could be close to three hundred. As such, the island was avoided by locals, and other than the prison, was completely undeveloped. After the prison was closed down in 2004, the island's pristine condition made it ideal as a reserve. It is now said that the prison is haunted by the ghosts of prisoners. One story is that a guard was chasing a prisoner, but the prisoner was a ghost. The guard was so scared that he shot himself. It is also one of the last places in Central America where the scarlet macaw can be found in large numbers in the wild. The island is about 75% forested with a large fraction standing ancient forest. Coiba Island is home to rare flora and fauna found only on the island. The island also harbours tree species that have long disappeared from the mainland due to deforestation and overharvesting. Coiba National Park In 1992, Panama created Coiba National Park, encompassing over 1,042 square miles of islands, forests, beaches, mangroves and coral reefs, and in July 2005, Unesco declared it a World Heritage Site. The park includes Coiba island, 38 smaller islands off the southwest coast of Panama, and the surrounding marine areas within the Gulf of Chiriqu√≠ providing protection for coral reefs, humpback whales, pilot whales, killer whales, dolphins, sea turtles, manta rays, marlins and other marine creatures. Due to the Gulf of Chiriqu√≠'s capacity to buffer against the effects of El Ni√±o temperature swings, the marine ecosystems within Coiba National Park harbor a high degree of biodiversity. The park harbors 760 species of marine fishes, 33 species of sharks and 20 species of cetaceans. Climate Coiba has a tropical monsoon climate (Am) with moderate to little rainfall from January to April and heavy to very heavy rainfall from May to December.

In 2004 it opened the Grange Building, housing over 100 boarders, as well as classrooms and house staff accommodation. In 2006, the 19th century Argyle buildings in the heart of the College were refurbished. The old Cadogan Building opened in January 2008 as a new music school. Academic standards are high; in 2006, the average points score by all Leaving Certificate candidates was 440 out of 625, and in 2007 this went up slightly to 442. In 2008 it was 424, in 2009 446, and in 2010 the highest yet at 459. Over the past five years the average has been: 442 points. Average class size is 12 pupils per teacher. The Sunday Independent newspaper has identified it as the most expensive school in Ireland.Sunday Independent, 4 May 2008. School fees continued to rise in 2015-16. House system St Columba's operates a house system. Each pupil is placed in one of seven houses; Stackallan, Glen or Gwynn for all boys Form II to VI; Hollypark or Iona for all girls; Beresford for junior girls; Tibradden for boys under 13. The size of house ranges from 20 to 65 pupils. A Housemaster or Housemistress, assisted by at least one resident House Tutor, is in charge of each house, and acts in loco parentis in every aspect of the children's welfare throughout their time at the college. Tibradden and Beresford occupy separate buildings in the centre of the college. Like the senior houses each has its own living and sleeping quarters and routine. Older boys and girls, selected by the house staff, help to provide an existence more structured and more protected than that of the rest of the school. Terms The school year is divided into three terms of which the first, the Michaelmas Term (September to December) is the longest. The Hilary Term is from January to March. The third is the Trinity Term, from April to June, and this is when external public examinations are taken. The Michaelmas Term has a substantial holiday at half- term, when the college closes down. There are also shorter half-term breaks in the other terms, including following the St Columba's Day celebrations in late May or early June. Each term there is a three- or four-day Exodus during which the college closes; most pupils from outside of Ireland stay with their guardians, or Irish school friends. Old Columban Society Founded in 1909, the Old Columban Society is the alumni organization of the college. The first president of the society was Acting-Warden R M Gwynn supported by OCs W.F.S. Bantry White and Cecil L. Smith. It keeps members in touch with each other and the college and has also published books about the history of the college. The school magazine TheColumban was first published in 1879. During the First World War it denounced the Easter Rising. Many OCs were officers in the British Army, so that when one of them died the bell in college was rung in commemoration. In 1917, a Treasurer was appointed to oversee editorials and printing. Each year in May the Old Columban Bulletin is published, containing about 25 pages of news of Old Columbans and the college. Regular dinners and drinks parties are organised, in Dublin, London and Belfast. An Old Columban Scholarship is awarded to children of Old Columbans, who are all entitled to a discount on College fees. Currently they have over 3,000 members, of whom over 50% live in the Republic of Ireland, 5% in Northern Ireland, 16% in Great Britain, 5% in continental Europe and 7% in the rest of the world. Old Columbans Germany has established a website, and is organizing events for Old Columbans from Germany as well as Old Columbans living in Germany.

He has been called \\"Japan's greatest lacquerer\\",Earle, Joe, \\"Zeshin Redux\\", Orientations, Vol. 29, No. 2, March, 2008, p. 136 but his reputation as painter and print artist is more complex: In Japan, he is known as both too modern, a panderer to the Westernization movement, and also an overly conservative traditionalist who did nothing to stand out from his contemporaries. Despite holding this complicated reputation in Japan, Zeshin has come to be well regarded and much studied among the art world of the West, in Britain and the United States in particular.  Biography  Zeshin was born and raised in Edo (modern-day Tokyo). His grandfather Izumi Chobei and his father Ichigoro were shrine carpenters (miyadaiku) and skilled wood carvers. His father, who had taken his wife's family name of Shibata, was also an experienced ukiyo-e painter, having studied under Katsukawa Shunsh≈ç. This, of course, gave him an excellent start on the road to being an artist and craftsman. At age eleven, Kametaro, as Zeshin was called in his childhood, became apprenticed to a lacquerer named Koma Kansai II. At age 13, the young man who would become Zeshin abandoned the name Kametaro and became Junzo. Koma Kansai decided that his young charge would need to learn to sketch, paint, and create original designs in order to become a great lacquerer. He arranged for young Shibata to study under Suzuki Nanrei, a great painter of the Shij≈ç school. Shibata then took on yet another artist's name, abandoning Junzo and signing his works \\"Reisai,\\" using the Rei from Suzuki Nanrei, and the sai from Koma Kansai. It was during his time with Nanrei that he was given the name Zeshin, which he would stick with for the rest of his life. The name has a meaning similar to \\"this is true\\" or \\"the Truth\\", a reference to an old Chinese tale of a king who held an audience with a great number of painters. While nearly all of the painters afforded the king the proper respect, bowing before him and comporting themselves appropriately, one arrived half-naked, did not bow, and sat on the floor licking his paintbrush; the king exclaimed \\"now, this is a true artist!\\" From this the name Zeshin was taken. Zeshin learned not only the basics of painting and sketching, but also Japanese tea ceremony, haiku and waka poetry, history, literature and philosophy. This would form the foundation of his training in not only the techniques of the traditional arts, but also, and perhaps more importantly, the aesthetic and philosophy of Japanese traditional art. Many of his works from the period of his studies with Nanrei were fan paintings. The great ukiyo-e artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi was impressed with these fan paintings and, approaching the young painter, began a friendship which would last for many years. Zeshin later studied under other great artists of the Kyoto school, including Maruyama ≈åkyo, Okamoto Toyohiko, and Goshin. Though he would later be known primarily for his work with lacquers, Zeshin excelled at traditional ink painting, and produced many works of traditional subjects such as tigers and waterfalls. Though Japanese masters (sensei) are often quite egotistical and arrogant before their students, one of Zeshin's teachers is reputed to have made the comment that \\"just as you cannot appreciate the size of Mt. Fuji while standing upon it, so you cannot truly appreciate my skill and reputation while in Kyoto; when you return to Edo you will realize my incredible import and your great fortune in having studied under me.\\" Zeshin, on the other hand, is reputed to have told his own students that he did not wish them to be known as \\"a pupil of Zeshin's, but rather as a great artist who studied under a man called Zeshin.\\" Koma Kansai died in 1835, and Zeshin inherited the Koma School workshop. He took on a young man by the name of Ikeda Taishin as a pupil; Taishin would remain his pupil and close friend until his death in 1903. Zeshin married in 1849 and named his first son Reisai, but lost his mother and his wife both soon afterwards. In the 1830s and 1840s, Japan suffered an economic crisis, and artists were strictly limited, by law, in their use of silver and gold, both nearly essential for traditional styles of lacquer decoration. Zeshin compensated by using bronze to simulate the look and texture of iron, and with a variety of other substances and decorative styles to keep his work beautiful, while remaining traditional and doable. Many of his pieces could be said to embrace the concept of wabi, that is, beauty and elegance in the very simple, as exemplified by the Japanese tea ceremony. Although very few of his Edo period (pre-1868) pieces survive, it is evident in many of his later pieces that he would use, at times, a very simple and nearly colorless style of decoration, while continuing to use the traditional designs such as flowers and reeds. \\"Waves\\" maki-e panel, 1888-1890, the Khalili Collection of Japanese Art Beginning in 1869, Zeshin was commissioned to work for the Imperial government, and created many works of art for them which are no longer extant. These included a set of gold-lacquered chairs for the Imperial Palace decorated in a sakura (cherry blossom) motif. He was later made Japan's official representative to several international expositions, including Vienna in 1873, Philadelphia the following year, and Paris, although he did not personally attend any of these.O'Brien, Mary Louise, Martin Foulds, and Howard A. Link, The art of Shibata Zeshin, The Mr. and Mrs. James E. O'Brien Collection at the Honolulu Academy of Arts, Honolulu Academy of Arts, 1979, p. 17 One year before his death in 1891, Zeshin was granted the immense honor of membership in the newly created Imperial Art Committee and is uptoday the only one artist who has been recognized in 2 fields (painting and maki-e) of work. The honor of Imperial Commissioned Artists was only granted to 53 artists between 1890 and 1944. Today, one of the greatest collections of Zeshin's works is the Khalili Collections of London, containing over 100 works by the artist. Style Crows Fly by Red Sky at Sunset, woodblock print, ca. 1880 (Brooklyn Museum) Autumn Grasses in Moonlight, ink, lacquer, and silver leaf on paper, 1872‚Äì91 (Metropolitan Museum of Art) Inr≈ç with design of lotus, made of wood, lacquer, shell and glass, with silk cord, late Edo-early Meiji period (Metropolitan Museum of Art) Zeshin experimented with the technical aspects of lacquer. He mixed his lacquers with a variety of substances to achieve different colors and textures, and to control the consistency and flexibility. He invented a method of painting with lacquer sap directly on paper sized with d≈çsa (a solution of alum and animal glue), to prevent flaking when his urushi-e scroll paintings were rolled up.O'Brien, Mary Louise, Martin Foulds, and Howard A. Link, The art of Shibata Zeshin, The Mr. and Mrs. James E. O'Brien Collection at the Honolulu Academy of Arts, Honolulu Academy of Arts, 1979, p. 25Doshin, Sato, Shibata Zeshin: From Lacquer Arts to Painting, Nezu Museum, Tokyo, 2012, p. IX He used bronze in his lacquer to simulate the appearance and texture of iron, and cereal starch to thicken his lacquer to simulate, at least in some respects, the effect of Western oil painting. Zeshin remains, in fact, the only artist to be successful in the medium of urushi-e, as it requires specially treated paper, and a very particular consistency of lacquer to be used as paint. Zeshin also revived a complex lacquer technique called seikai-ha to produce wave forms by drawing a comb through the rapidly solidifying lacquer; this technique is so difficult it had not been used for over a century.O'Brien, Mary Louise, Martin Foulds, and Howard A. Link, The Art of Shibata Zeshin, The Mr. and Mrs. James E. O'Brien Collection at the Honolulu Academy of Arts, Honolulu Academy of Arts, 1979, p. 119 However, although he used many revolutionary elements in his work, both technically and creatively, Zeshin's works were always, on the whole, very traditional. In the brand-new medium of lacquer painting, he would paint traditional subjects like birds and flowers, insects, waterfalls and dragons. He copied a famous painting of a tiger by his teacher Maruyama Okyo, in lacquer. A red, black and gold lacquer picnic set by Zeshin serves as another good example of this revolutionary traditionalism. The picnic set is made in very traditional style, almost entirely of red and black lacquer with gold decorations of leaves and branches. However, on the serving tray is a series of butterflies and dragonflies, inlaid into the surface of the serving tray and carved out of iridescent seashell. Zeshin's signature was always quite subdued, and on occasion he would be playful with the idea of the signature. There is a decorative tsuba (sword handguard) made by him on which an ant, displayed in relief in lacquer, is carrying away the \\"shin\\" character (Áúü) of Zeshin's signature to the other side of the piece. It has been said that much of Zeshin's work strongly represents the aesthetic concept of iki (Á≤ã), which might be translated as \\"chic.\\" The Edo concept of iki, known as sui in Kansai, was described most authoritatively by Kuki Sh≈´z≈ç, but like the English ideas of chic, cool, and stylish, the precise colors, patterns, and other stylistic elements that constitute iki are nearly impossible to pin down. Nevertheless, that said, Zeshin's works are often labeled as iki, and considered to have just the right balance of tradition with the new, being beautiful but not gaudy and simple but not boring and smart but not arrogant. His style has been compared by some to haiku, in that its beauty and meaning is more powerful in what is not shown than by what is. Along with Nakayama Komin and Shirayama Shosai, he is considered one of the three great late lacquerers of Japan.  Exhibitions Exhibitions of Zeshin's works have taken place in various institutions internationally. * Japanese Lacquer, 1600-1900 : selections from the Charles A.

A Baby Guinness contains no Guinness stout. Its name is derived from the fact that it is made in such a way as to look like a tiny glass of stout. Preparation A portion of coffee liqueur (e.g., Tia Maria, Kahl√∫a or Patr√≥n Cafe) is topped by a layer of Irish Cream (e.g., Baileys or Coole Swan, the premium Irish Cream liqueur) which is poured over the back of a spoon so that it sits on the coffee liqueur. The ratio of coffee liqueur to Irish cream varies but is generally around 3-to-1. The resulting drink looks like a miniature pint of Guinness stout, with the coffee liqueur as the beer and the Irish cream as the head. It is normally served in a shot glass. Some recipes call for the Irish cream to be whipped then spooned on top of the coffee liqueur in order to look more like the head on a pint of Guinness.

Its school colors are maroon and gold, and the Mascot is monarchs.  History  The Papillion- La Vista Public Schools District originated well over a century ago. It is reported to be the first school district to be established in Nebraska Territory, in 1872. Papillion-La Vista High School dates back to September 1876. Originally housed in a single brick building at the corner of Halleck & Adams Streets, Papillion's only school served students in all 12 grades. In 1893 the school moved to a new brick building at 420 S. Washington Street, the present site of the district offices. The city continued to grow, and in February 1957, Papillion High School opened in a new building across Washington Street (presently Papillion Junior High) to students in grades 7-12. The city of La Vista incorporated in 1960 and presented no education system. The students of this new development area north of Papillion had been incorporated into the Papillion School District. Papillion's steady growth continued. By September 1969, voters in the district had passed a bond issue to build a new high school facility at 84th Street and East Centennial Road. A similar bond issue the preceding year had been defeated. The high school moved north to its present location in August 1971, serving students in grades 9 through 12. In 1987, La Vista was officially added to the district and the high school's name was officially changed to Papillion-La Vista High School.plhs.esu3.org - accessed 2011-09-08 The 1999 film Election was shot mainly in Papillion-La Vista High School. Papillion-La Vista High School had actual classes going on during much of the filming of Election. The background noises during much of the film are actual teachers and their students in nearby rooms.  Second high school  Continued population growth resulted in the construction of Papillion-La Vista South High School (PLSHS), in southwest Papillion, which opened in August 2003. PLHS had previously been a 10-12 school, and 9th graders had attended classes at the two junior high schools in the district. After the school district opened a second high school, the freshman class was moved from the junior high schools to the two high schools.

History Saint Swithun's church, Leadenham There is evidence of Bronze Age, Romano-British and Early Medieval occupation. The name of the village probably comes from the Anglo-Saxon 'Leodan' and 'ham' for \\"homestead or village of a man called Leoda.\\" It appears in the Domesday Book as \\"Ledeneham\\". Much of the village belonged to the Reeve family whose family seat is still Leadenham House, a Georgian country house built from 1790 for William Reeve. The Royal Flying Corps airfield to the east was built in 1916, and closed in 1919. In 1995 the village was bypassed to the south by the A17.

The monument is also referred to as a 'Medieval Tower House'. The tower is located on the route of the Fife Coastal Path. History Built in the 16th century (c. 1542), Seafield Tower lies between Kinghorn and Kirkcaldy in Fife, Scotland. The lands of Seafield and Markinch were granted to Robert Multrare by James II of Scotland in 1443.South Carolina Historical and Genealogical Magazine p. 230. The lands and the tower remained in the ownership of the Multrare (or Moultrie as the family name became) until 1631 when the lands were sold to James Law, the Archbishop of Glasgow.South Carolina Historical and Genealogical Magazine p. 239. With Law's death in 1632, the tower passed through various owners. The Methven family were the last known owners of the tower. Its last owner was Methven of Raith who abandoned it in 1733, leaving it to it fall into disrepair and, eventually, ruin. The completed tower was believed to be five stories high with walls thick and maximum internal dimensions of by .South Carolina Historical and Genealogical Magazine p. 243. It was constructed in an 'L' shape configuration using local red sandstone. The Tower would have had a vaulted storage area on the ground floor and a Great Hall on the first floor. The upper levels would have been the lord's accommodation. A plan from 1774 shows ancillary buildings - including a bakery, brewery and stables - which were located in an enclosure to the west of the Tower. These buildings would normally have been protected by a barmkin (curtain wall) but, unfortunately, any evidence of this has been lost due to coastal erosion. As it stands today, the ruin is merely a shell in derelict condition. Following a storm in January 2013, a significant part of the northwest corner of the tower collapsed.  Scheduled Monument  Between 1973 and 2015 the remains of the tower were designated a Category B listed building by Historic Scotland. The tower was removed from Category B in 2015 as, since 2003, the tower and its surrounding area (which has been schedule since 1937) have been designated as one combined scheduled monument.

Pettyfer is best known for his work on the independent circuit in the United Kingdom, where he is a former Unified British Tag Team Champion alongside Mark Haskins in International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom and Real Quality Wrestling and was a regular competitor in the Frontier Wrestling Alliance. He is also known for working in WWE's developmental territory NXT under the ring name Oliver Grey, where he was one half of the inaugural NXT Tag Team Champions along with Adrian Neville, often collectively known as 'British Ambition'. Professional wrestling career Early career (2006) Pettyfer started wrestling with Devon Junior Wrestling Alliance, where he wrestled under his own name, before going to Revolution British Wrestling and other UK indie promotions. His first appearance in the newly named Varsity Pro Wrestling (formerly RBW's southwest branch) was in Crediton, Devon where he would wrestle as Joel Redman in a match where he would be defeated by American wrestler Spiro from San Antonio, Texas on 26 January 2006. On a later VPW show, Redman attacked Aviv Maayan after Maayan's match. \\"The Twisted Genius\\" Dean Ayass then made his way to the ring and introduced Redman as his new prot√©g√©. On VPW's first Charity Show, Maayan got his chance to face Redman which Maayan won. However, this would not end their feud as once again after Mayaan lost a match to Jorge Castano, Redman and Ayass would once again come to the ring and attack Mayaan. After this attack Ayass would grab the microphone and tell the fans that on the next show back in Horndean, Joel Redman would face Aviv Mayaan once again. Redman's feud with Aviv Mayaan would not just be contained to VPW. After becoming an alumnus of the training school, Redman went on to train in the FWA Academy where he would face off with Mayaan once again, touring a Title tournament this time coming on the losing end of the match. After dominating several opponents throughout the end of 2006 in FWA:A, Redman would team up with FWA:A Champion LT Summers to defeat Mark Sloan and Ollie Burns for the FWA:A Tag Team Championships. Premier Promotions (2006‚Äì2012) Over the year, Redman has become a regular for Premier Promotions and made his debut in 2006 teaming with Kris Kay to defeat Chris Andrews and Sam Andrews. In late 2007, Redman participated in a one night tournament losing to Danny Collins in the semi finals. In early 2008, the PWF Mid-Heavyweight Championship was vacated by Doug Williams and to find a champion there was a round robin tournament which Redman was involved in, however, he would lose all his matches and was eliminated. Throughout 2008, Redman had made an impression on Premier Promtoions with his technical prowess and spirit to never give up, this culminated on 4 September when Redman defeated Marty Scurll in the finals of the Ian Dowland Trophy. With this win he took on Ricky Knight for the PWF Mid- Heavyweight Championship but lost via count out. Towards the end of 2009, a year Redman spent away from Premier Promotions, he returned to take part in the Ken Joyce Trophy 2009 but would lose to legendary British wrestler, Robbie Brookside, in the semi final. In March 2010, he won a one night tournament and would win another in April. Redman would once again become a regular for Premier Promotions and towards the end of the year defeated Justin Starr to win the Ken Joyce Trophy 2010. Following this win, on 27 February 2011, he defeated UK Dominator in a British rules match for the vacant PWF International Championship. As the reigning champion, Redman entered the Worthing Trophy 2011 and reached the final where he was defeated by Danny Garnell. Redman teamed up with Jonny Storm to take on Kris Kay and UK Dominator in a British rules match for the vacant PWF Tag Team Championship which they lost. Redman would vacate the PWF International Championship when he was signed by World Wrestling Entertainment and moved to their developmental system NXT Wrestling. Independent circuit (2007‚Äì2009, 2015‚Äìpresent) Redman formed a team with Mark Haskins known as The Thrillers, on their debut match together they lost to The South Coast Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ian Logan and Jake McCluskey) on 14 July 2007 which involved a special guest referee. The team would go on a losing streak for the next few months and even lost to The Kartel (Sha Samuels and Terry Frazier) in a match for the IPW:UK Tag Team Championship. The Thrillers won their first match as a tag team in a dark match by defeating JP Monroe and Jules Lambrini on 27 January 2008. The team debuted for Real Quality Wrestling on 16 February 2008 and defeated the Maximum Head (Dan Head & Max Voltage) and would next month beat The Lost Boys (Danny Darko and Jo FX). After their two successful matches they challenged The Damned Nation (Cameron Kraze and Dragon Aisu) on 26 April for the RQW Tag Team Championship which they won. The Thrillers returned to International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom on ‚çå152‚çç triumphant with tag team gold in the form of RQW Tag Team Championship only to lose the championship The Kartel (Sha Samuels & Terry Frazier) in a championship unification match which also involved IPW:UK Tag Team Championship. The team debuted for One Pro Wrestling losing to BritRage (Mark Sloan & Wade Fitzgerald). However they would beat The Kartel on 28 September for the Unified British Tag Team Championship. The Thrillers would then debuted for Westside Xtreme Wrestling at the beginning of 2009 and won a wXw Tag Team Championship contendership match defeating Adam Polak and Lazio Fe. With that win, they challenged Doug Williams and Martin Stone for the wXw Tag Team Championship the following month, but were unable to win the title. Upon their return to IPW:UK, The Thrillers lost the Unified British Tag Team Championship to The Leaders of The New School (Marty Scurll and Zack Sabre, Jr.). The Thrillers tried to regain the championship on two separate occasions, the first ending in DQ and the second where they were defeated clean in a tables, ladder and chairs match. On 15 February 2015, Martin Stone was confirmed to have returned to the United States for another company, so Joel Redman had to choose another partner to substitute for Stone. At High Stakes, this partner was revealed to be Mark Haskins, not only successfully defending the titles, but reuniting once more. After Haskins was injured in mid-2015, Jake McCluskey stepped in as a replacement partner at Summer Sizzler, however, Redman and McCluskey were unable to defeat The Kartel (Sha Samuels and James Castle) and subsequently lost the British Tag Team Championship. In 2016, Redman began teaming with Charlie Garrett, and the duo successfully defeated The Kartel on 12 June 2016 at Angle vs Sabre Jr. to end their reign at two days short of one year. Their first defence took place the next month at Summer Sizzler, defeating Jody Fleisch and Jonny Storm, Jake McCluskey and Kieran Bruce and The Legion of Lords (Gideon Grey and Rishi Ghosh) in a fatal four way to retain. Redman and Garrett successfully defended the championships once again in November, defeating NJPW's Los Ingobernables de Japon (Evil and Bushi) at Global Wars UK. Redman and Garrett (now known as Charlie Sterling) made two successful defences in January 2017, first defeating The London Riots (James Davis and Rob Lynch) at Live at the Cockpit 12, and War Machine (Hanson and Raymond Rowe) at High Stakes.

After competing only a few matches in 2008, the next year he became a regular at the promotion. He took on LA Warren for the IWW Zero Gravity Championship and Mandrake for the IWW International Heavyweight Championship on multiple occasions but would also come up short. In mid-2009, Redman had formed a partner ship with Captain Rooney which for their short time together worked, winning all their matches, however Rooney would turn on Redman and joined up with Bingo Ballance. The Redman and Ballance feud culminated with Ballance coming out on top. Redman's last match for IWW was against Mandrake for the IWW International Heavyweight Championship, once again losing. WWE =Florida Championship Wrestling (2012)= In a March 2012 interview, Pettyfer stated that he had signed a contract with WWE following two try-out matches and was waiting for his visa to be approved before he could travel to Florida to join WWE's developmental territory. Pettyfer made his debut under the Joel Redman name at a Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) live event on 20 June 2012, teaming with Conor O'Brian, against Garrett Dylan and Rick Victor in a losing effort.

The closest town is Market Harborough. The population of the civil parish (including Laughton, Leics) at the 2011 census was 209. The name Gumley is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon \\"Gutmundesleah\\" ‚Äì meaning Godmund's clearing.  History  The village is first mentioned in 749. King √Üthelbald of Mercia (r.716-757) held a synod at Gumley in that year, at the instigation of Saint Boniface, to answer accusations that he had been oppressing churches and monasteries. The outcome was that √Üthelbald released the Church from all public burdens except the three common burdens of providing military service, and building and repairing bridges and fortresses. These obligations arguably initiated changes in the land tenurial system of England and eventually led to serfdom. King Offa visited Gumley in 772 and 779 for the witanagemot of the kings of Mercia. On the south side of Gumley Covert there is a pond called \\"the Mot\\" which may be a Saxon site. The pond stands in a small natural amphitheatre near a mound surmounted with trees. After the Norman Conquest Gumley was given to Countess Judith, the Conqueror's niece. At that time there were twenty inhabitants. In the medieval period there were dwellings below the village towards Thornhill Farm, of which little remains apart from some surface irregularities and cobbles on the footpath passing by Too Cottage. There were also houses by the 'holloways' in Crow Spinney beside the parish church. Gumley's population peaked in 1821 when 281 residents were engaged working the land as well as making lace and stockings. Now there are about 105 people on the electoral roll. Because Gumley has been surrounded by pasture predominantly, the medieval ridge and furrow method of working the land is particularly well preserved and its fields are subject to preservation orders.  Gumley Hall  Gumley Hall was built in 1764 for Joseph Cradock (d. 1826). It consists of a large three storey red brick central block, flanked by two-story pavilions connected to the main block by quadrant walls. Internally many of the features, including the main staircase with its cast-iron balustrade, appear to date from the earlier 19th century. These were probably inserted between 1823 and 1833 by Sir Edmund Cradock-Hartopp who apparently took over the house in an unfinished condition. South of the hall and opening upon the village street the red-brick stables built round a courtyard were erected by Capt. Whitmore; the clock tower in the style of an Italian campanile bears the inscription Incorrupta Fides and a weathercock dated 1870. Cradock laid out the gardens and plantations of Gumley Hall in imitation of the Parc de Saint- Cloud, and in the summer months they became a fashionable resort for the gentry of Leicester, particularly those who came to take the mineral waters of its 'spa', a chalybeate spring found in 1789. Cradock moved in the literary society of Goldsmith, Johnson, and Burke, and built a theatre at Gumley which was used for amateur productions and by Garrick. The owners of Gumley Hall in the 19th century, were not always resident. There were at least two periods when the hall was in the hands of tenants-the 1860s and the 1890s. The Cradock-Hartopps let it to Lt.-Col. Dottin Maycock (1816‚Äì79) before he moved to Foxton Lodge, and then to Viscount Ingestre (1830‚Äì77) before he succeeded as 19th Earl of Shrewsbury in 1868. After many structural alterations in 1869-70, the new owner, Capt. Whitmore, came into residence. From c. 1890, when he moved to Essex, he let the hall to a succession of tenants: Thomas Keay Tapling (1855‚Äì91), M.P. for South Leicestershire; James Coats (1834‚Äì1913), of J. & P. Coats, Ltd.; and from 1893 Mrs. Emma Bellville, who afterwards moved to Stoughton Grange. In 1897 the hall was bought by the Murray Smiths, who lived there until 1940. One of their governesses was Evelyn Cheesman, later a celebrated entomologist and traveller. G. A. Murray Smith then moved into the Rectory, which was no longer required by the incumbent. During the Second World War the Hall was used to train resistance fighters and Special Operations Executive and afterwards Leonard Cheshire was given the use of the Hall for those servicemen returning homeless after demobilisation. The Hall became increasingly dilapidated and was demolished in 1964. Other buildings St Helens Church mostly dates from the 14th century with later additions. The tenor bell was cast around 1520. The interior of the church was restored in the Victorian era in 1874 and is a good example of the Decorative style. There is a service every Sunday with a family service once a month. At the Engine House gas was manufactured for the Hall. There was a Post Office and part of the bakery remains as outbuildings of Westfield. The Butchers shop was at the 'Js' where it was preserved as a museum until recently. There were two public houses in the 1840s, the Hartopp Arms and the Bluebell, which later became The Bell. Only two of seven farms in Gumley are left. Grade 2 listed structures in the village include Hall Farm, Rose Cottage and Fenleigh House, Stone House, Leys Farm and the village pump. The Motte Castle, a tree ringed mound to the west of Gumley is a Scheduled Monument. The Village Hall was opened in 1969 on the site of Gumley's former school, which closed in 1933. It is run as a charitable trust and has a small committee open to anyone from the village who cares to join. There is a fish and chips evening in February and a summer barbecue in August as well as other social events. Village activities  Gumley Women's Institute was founded in 1918 and is one of the oldest in the whole country. Meetings are still held most months in the Village Hall. The Fernie Hunt, founded in 1919, traditionally holds its opening meet in Gumley in October. Gumley Cricket Club is a village cricket team based in Gumley, Leicestershire, England. The club has three teams, the Saturday and Sunday XI's play friendly fixtures against an established selection of clubs.

It is situated in the north of the town, on Burnmill Road, close to St Luke's Hospital. History Around 1570, Robert Smyth, from the town, walked to London. By 1598, he had become comptroller of the City of London. In 1607 he founded Market Harborough Grammar School. The building still exists in the Market Place. For the first 150 years, it was only open to boys who were of the Anglican faith. In 1909, Leicestershire County Council built a new school, called the County Grammar School of Edward VII, on the present location on Burnmill Road. In 1944, the school fees were stopped and it became known as Market Harborough Grammar School. In 1978, it became Robert Smyth School, and in 2011, it became Robert Smyth Academy It used to be known as Market Harborough Upper School, being one of the few remaining upper schools in England. It is now one of the most rapidly improving schools in Leicestershire with an increase to Progress 8 of +0.25 signalling the best results attained by students since the inception of new accountability measures in 2016. The Academy is now well on track to becoming the only outstanding secondary school in the town. With around 100 staff and 881 pupils, it provides a comprehensive education for pupils from Year 7 and then into Key Stage 4 (KS4), for GCSE and Post-16 (A-levels). It has been awarded both an Investors in People award and an Artsmark Gold award. In 2006 a successful application was put forward for the school to become a dual status technology/arts college. The catchment area of the school covers both the town of Market Harborough itself and the surrounding South Leicestershire villages, primarily Kibworth, Fleckney, Great Glen, King's Norton, Foxton, the Langtons, Gumley and Laughton. The school converted to academy status in September 2011.http://www.rsacademy.co.uk/?p=10 In September 2017, the Academy became a member of the Tudor Grange Academies Trust (TGAT). Since then, many changes have taken place, such as the new tutor groups, houses, lesson times, uniforms, dress code, IT infrastructure and more. The Academy has introduced several changes in September 2018 to maximise the quality of education experienced by students, with six 50-minute lessons changing to five 60-minute lessons, including different lunch times for Y7-8 and Y9-13. Additionally, bells will no longer be used to signal lesson times and instead students are trusted to rely on their own timekeeping to get to lessons on time.https://www.robertsmyth.tgacademy.org.uk/files/2018/07/Changes-to-the- school-day.pdf Houses and forms The school consists of four 'houses', Bragg, Logan (formerly Wartnaby), Moseley and Hammond (formerly Pickering). The houses are named after historical figures from the town and are mainly in existence for administrative purposes (main school lessons are timetabled by house group and house assemblies are held weekly) but inter-house sports are also popular activities. Two Year 12 pupils from each house are nominated by staff annually to become school prefects. Sixth Form Post-16, or sixth form as it's commonly known, is housed in the 'Sixth Form Centre', a separate building to the lower school, providing a cafeteria, computer suite and quiet work areas. Sixth form lessons are held throughout the school - the Sixth Form Centre has a few classrooms, but the majority of classes are still taught in the main buildings. Both sixth form and main school pupils have access to the library, which also contains computers. Lower school pupils have a separate canteen. Facilities Other notable facilities of the school are the Main Hall - an assembly hall, in which assemblies are held, as well as concerts, proms and other large-scale events. The Old Gym, which previously allowed pupils can take part in activities such as trampolining and table tennis, has been converted into a performing arts hall - \\"The Max\\", named after governor Maxwell Corney. This has a highly flexible format with space for dancing classes, acting and small offset theory classrooms. A new/extended sports centre has been built adjacent to the existing one (in which indoor football, netball, basketball and other sports can be played) to modernise the sports facilities at the school. There is also a large school field, on which football, hockey and rugby are played, an outdoor basketball court and two tennis courts. The library offers the usual reference facilities plus a thriving lunch time chess club. The school has a number of IT rooms, all networked with internet access and several science labs. A new canteen for years 10 and 11 opened on 18 February 2011. The ¬£1 million facility was built to replace a Nissen hut style structure and contains a kitchen, dining room and new food technology classroom. Pupils voted for the name of the canteen, selecting 'Sixteen07' in honour of the school's founding date.http://www.harboroughmail.co.uk/news/local- news/school_kitchen_officially_open_1_2429708 Alumni * Richard Clarke (diplomat), High Commissioner to Tanzania from 2001‚Äì03 * Matthew Cornwell - Northampton Saints player, Ex Exeter player, Ex Leicester Tigers player and England U21 Captain * Dan Cole (rugby union) - Leicester Tigers player and England Saxon * Josh Devine - Drummer for One Direction * Martin Johnson - Former rugby player and former manager of the England rugby union team. * Josh Knight - footballer on loan to Peterborough United from Leicester City * Andy Peake - Former footballer * Allison Pearson (n√©e Judith Lobbett) - Daily Mail columnist * Frances Quinn - winner of The Great British Bake Off * Ben Smith - Leicestershire and Worcestershire county cricketer and batting coach * Prof Bob White FRS, geophysicist, Professor of Geophysics at the University of Cambridge *Nina Stibbe -Writer of \\"Love Nina\\", \\"Man at the Helm\\", \\"Paradice Lodge\\" \\"An Almost Perfect Christmas\\" & \\"Reasons to be Cheerful\\" Market Harborough Grammar * Sir William Henry Bragg KBE, Nobel prize-winning physicist and inventor of the X-ray spectrometer * Prof Dame Rosemary Cramp (1940-7), Professor of Archaeology, University of Durham (1971‚Äì90) * Prof Ann- Louise Kinmonth CBE, Professor of General Practice from 1997‚Äì2011 at the University of Cambridge, and Professor of Primary Medical Care from 1992‚Äì96 at the University of SouthamptonAnn-Louise Kinmonth * Sqn Ldr Tony Pickering, Battle of Britain pilotTony Pickering * Sir Edmund Spriggs FRCPEdmund Spriggs * David Wells, Managing Director of the Service Division from 1993‚Äì96 at British Gas * Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Keith Williamson (1939‚Äì44) Chief of the Air Staff 1982-85 References External links * Official School website * School history Category:Academies in Leicestershire Category:Upper schools in Leicestershire Category:Market Harborough ","title":"Robert Smyth Academy"},{"id":"4263389","text":"BAAS may refer to * Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences, a bachelor's degree offered at some universities * Belgian Association of Ambulatory Surgery * British Association for the Advancement of Science, now the British Science Association * British Association for American Studies * British Association of Audiological Scientists * Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society  See also  * Baas, surname * wikt:baas ","title":"BAAS"},{"id":"4263391","text":"Marion Higgins may refer to: *Marion Higgins (supercentenarian) (1893-2006), American supercentenarian *Marion West Higgins (1915-1991), first female Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly ","title":"Marion Higgins"},{"id":"4263408","text":"The Late Show (1989‚Äì1995) is a British television arts magazine programme that was broadcast on BBC2 weeknights at 11.15pm--directly after Newsnight--often referred to as the \\"graveyard slot\\" in terms of television scheduling. Details The programme was commissioned by BBC2 Controller Alan Yentob, who had a background in serious arts documentaries, but the production team -- led by Michael Jackson -- were mostly from youth programming backgrounds including Network 7. The programme combined a number of format elements from earlier BBC arts magazine programmes such as Monitor and Late Night Line-Up. Once a week, during the first two series, the slot featured a round-table discussion hosted by Clive James on Friday nights. With the cancellation of The Old Grey Whistle Test, The Late Show featured music performances, live or pre-recorded, including Van Morrison, Leonard Cohen, Public Enemy, Joni Mitchell, The Stone Roses, Dick Dale, The Cramps, The Smashing Pumpkins, The Fall, R.E.M., Little Village, Jane's Addiction and Jeff Buckley. At the time, The Late Show came under the now closed Music and Arts Department of BBC Television, which also produced Omnibus and Arena. The forty and sometimes fifty-minute programmes were presented mostly live from a bare black set in Lime Grove Studio D until 14 June 1991, when it transferred to BBC Television Centre in White City, west London. The regular format was for a single presenter to provide links for a number of packaged features and interviews or panel discussion in the studio. Some editions were given over to in-depth coverage of a single topic, for example a whole programme on National Poetry Day. The 1989‚Äì1995 revival of Face to Face, this time presented by Jeremy Isaacs, was also an element of the programme. Some weeks would be given over to one subject across the week, such as Italy week, Berlin week and, in 1995, Ireland week. Some outside broadcasts were made at the time by the Late Show team including the ceremonies to award the Booker Prize and the Mercury Music Prize. Most items were pre-recorded on videotape. Amongst the directors who worked on the programme are Paul Tickell, David Upshal, Sheree Folkson, Mark Cooper, David Evans, Anand Tucker, Mary Harron, Vanessa Engle and Sharon Maguire. Later in the programme's run a regular panel discussion -- Late Review -- was introduced looking at new films, books and plays and other arts and cultural events. Regular contributors to this included Tony Parsons, Tom Paulin and Allison Pearson, and it was chaired by The Guardian journalist Mark Lawson. In 1991, Jackson left the programme to become Head of Music and Arts at the BBC; he later became Controller of BBC2 in 1993. From 1992 The Late Show was joined by the follow-on weekly music slot Later with Jools Holland that also drew away the programme's appeal to popular music acts. As Controller of BBC1, Alan Yentob began to revamp that channel's arts coverage which also competed editorially with The Late Show. The programme proper was cancelled by Jackson in 1995. Late Review continued until March 2013 when it was moved from BBC Two to BBC Four and went from a weekly to a monthly broadcast slot. It went through a number of incarnations, and now entitled The Review Show, it is produced by the team that makes Newsnight. Former Editor Roly Keating is now the Chief Executive of the British Library. Janice Hadlow is now the controller of BBC Two. Presenters The Late Shows presenters were mostly picked from up-and- coming writers and critics rather than professional broadcasters or journalists. For many it was their first exposure on mainstream television. Regular presenters included: *Paul Morley, presenter of first episode *Tracey MacLeod *Michael Ignatieff *Sarah Dunant *Clive James *Waldemar Januszczak *Matthew Collings *Kirsty Wark *Francine Stock *Mark Lawson Occasional presenters: *Melvyn Bragg *Jeremy Isaacs *Fintan O'Toole *Susan Sontag Regular reporters: *Benjamin Woolley *Tom Brook Notable moments *Outburst by actor Keith Allen (eventually directed at a producer on the studio floor) during a round-table discussion on comedy.

The Honda VTX 1800 was launched in 2001 as a 2002 model. At the time this bike was introduced the Honda VTX engine was the largest displacement production V-twin in the world, but that distinction would be short-lived as the VTX1800 was superseded in 2004 by the 2.0-liter Kawasaki Vulcan 2000. Nevertheless, the VTX 1800 still produced better 0-60 mph and 1/4 mile times. VTX stands for V-Twin Extreme. The VTX1300 line was introduced for the 2003 model year, which evolved into the VT1300C line starting with the 2010 model year. In addition to the 52¬∞ V-twin layout, commonalities for the 1800 and 1300 powertrains include: *radiator with cooling fan; *cylinder heads with two intake valves and a single, larger, exhaust valve; *rocker arms with screw-and-locknut clearance adjusters; *electronic control unit with 3-D ignition maps for each cylinder; *two spark plugs per cylinder; *dry sump oil system with the oil tank inside the gearbox case; *shaft final-drive.  VTX1800  Honda VTX1800 motorcycle engine Making amends for years of underperforming V-twins, Honda set out to produce a cruiser with the biggest CID ever and so designed a big bike with a muscular looking body that was long and low to the ground, featuring significant rake and trail. Honda claimed that the 1800 put out of torque at only 3,000 rpm and at 5000 rpm, making the VTX1800 one of the most powerful production V-twin motorcycles of its time. (See infobox for measured horsepower and torque values.) On the VTX1800, Honda updated its linked braking feature, instead of having the usual separate hand and foot brakes, the hand brake operated two-thirds of the front pistons while the foot operated the other third in front and all the rear via a proportioning valve. The induction system was Honda's programmed Fuel Injection (PGM-FI) system using a Manifold Air Pressure (MAP) sensor in the small throttle areas until the standard throttle position sensor (Alpha N) took over at greater throttle opening values. The VTX1800 also had an emission control system that utilized air injection and catalytic converter controlled by the ECU to reduce hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen to levels surpassing emissions standards. The 52-degree V-twin included an offset-dual-pin crankshaft, a design first used on the 1983 Honda Shadow to produce perfect primary balance, as well as two primary-shaft-mounted counterbalancer weights to reduce the inevitable rocking couple vibration in a large V-twin engine. There were three 2002 models, the initial VTX1800C Classic and then two Retro models, the VTX1800R with cast wheels plus the VTX1800S with spoke wheels (and tube-type tires). When the VTX1800C was introduced in 2001, it was known as the VTX1800, or more often simply called the VTX. Honda of Japan announced the immediate importation of the American-manufactured VTX1800 cruiser model for their domestic market. Compared to the Retro models (and the others that would follow) the VTX1800 type C was identifiable by its two-into-one exhaust system, and its speedometer mounted within the handlebar risers. All the other models had staggered dual exhausts and a tank-mounted speedometer, as well as a larger radiator. Honda's sales of the VTX1800 by late 2003 were approaching 30,000 units. A new model was introduced in late 2003 for the 2004 model year; the VTX1800N took its Neo-Retro style cues from the limited edition Valkyrie Rune. Honda added a more performance-oriented VTX1800F model in 2005, which had low-profile radial tires on cast alloy wheels with a five twin-spoke design, and also incorporated an LCD tachometer and clock into the tank- mounted speedometer. As one of the motorcycles that helped to define the Performance Cruiser market, the VTX1800F faced competition from the Yamaha Warrior, Victory Hammer, Kawasaki Mean Streak, and the Harley-Davidson Street Rod. A VTX1800T Tourer model equipped with saddlebags holding each, a windshield and a passenger backrest, was included in the 2007 line-up. 2008 was the final year for Honda's jumbo twin, available in three models: VTX1800N; VTX1800S; and VTX1800T. VTX1300 Honda VTX1300 motorcycle engine In 2002 Honda made the VTX1300S available, as a 2003 model, with an all-new liquid-cooled V-twin engine in traditional cruiser bodywork, rolling on spoked wheels. It sold quickly, and by the close of 2003 sales totaled almost 12,000 units. In contrast to the VTX1800 line, VTX1300 bikes used standard unlinked brakes, with a single large front disk, 336mm in diameter. The rear brake was a 296mm disc. Although it was similar to the 1800, the 1300 was not the same engine with a smaller bore or shorter stroke, but a new design. The 1300 engine used a 38 mm constant velocity carburetor unlike the fuel injected 1800. The single carb had a manual choke for cold starts, and was heated by engine coolant to improve cold-weather operation. The configuration of the new powerplant was the same liquid-cooled overhead-cam 52-degree V-twin layout as its larger sibling, but the VTX1300 engine was designed around a single-pin crankshaft, unlike the 1800s dual-pin crank. As a result, the 1300 required dual two-axis primary counterbalancers to control engine vibration. The VTX1300 engine had a cable-operated clutch, instead of the hydraulic clutch of the VTX1800. The 1300 engine used an air injection system and catalytic converters, similar to the bigger engine, as well as a lean fuel-air mixture to control emissions. The VTX1300 line employed the same two-into-two exhaust system across the board, as opposed to the model specific two-into-one system of the VTX1800C. In a road test on the Motorcycle USA website, editor Ken Hutchison observed that the VTX1300C had an \\"extra-muffled exhaust note that may be politically correct but it really detracts from the Big Twin experience potential buyers might be looking for.\\" Nevertheless, Motorcyclist magazine's Art Friedman opined that the VTX1300 \\"sound is classic V-twin\\", and that the bike had more responsive handling as well as a smoother drivetrain than its 1800cc lookalike. VTX1300 bikes came with the least possible instrumentation, one large analog speedometer (with a digital odometer) in a nacelle on top of the fuel tank, unaccompanied by so much as a clock or fuel gauge. The 2004 VTX1300S was joined by the lighter and shorter VTX1300C Custom with cast-alloy wheels, a drag-style handlebar, and without the floorboards and heel-and-toe shifter of the S model. The new C model also sold in large numbers in its first year, upwards of 11,000 units. 2005 saw the VTX1300 family grow to three models with the introduction of VTX1300R Retro, which combined traditional cruiser styling with cast-alloy wheels (and tubeless tires) in place of the wire wheels used on the otherwise identical VTX1300S. The R-model also did well on the showroom floor, with first-year sales over 8000 units. Honda continued on with those three models, type C, S and R, changing only the paintwork in 2006 and 2007. Honda dropped the spoked-wheel VTX1300S in 2008, but maintained lineup at three models by adding the VTX1300T Tourer variant (with cast wheels). The Tourer was basically a type R bike equipped at the factory with what had been the three accessories most often added by Honda dealers; saddlebags holding each, a windshield and a passenger backrest. In a Los Angeles Times road test, Susan Carpenter described the VTX1300T as a \\"Midwesterner's motorcycle\\", noting that many sales of the VTX1300 line were made in \\"corn country.\\" For 2008, the two-into-two exhaust system was redesigned to be more compact. 2009 was the final year for the VTX1300, available as type C, R and T models in new colors, but otherwise identical to the previous year. Competitive models included the Yamaha DragStar 1100 (aka V Star 1100) and V Star 1300, the Suzuki Boulevard S83, the Harley-Davidson Sportster 1200 Custom, the Kawasaki Vulcan 900 Classic and Vulcan 1500 Classic. Total sales for all types of VTX1300 cruisers amounted to 82,900 for all model years. VT1300C 2010 Honda Fury engine at the 2009 Seattle International Motorcycle Show In a series of introductions during 2009, Honda introduced the 2010 VT1300C Custom line to replace the VTX1300 line. In January 2009 Honda introduced the Fury VT1300CX at the New York International Motorcycle Show. The Sabre VT1300CS and Stateline VT1300CR were introduced at the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show, and the Interstate VT1300CT debuted at the Toronto Motorcycle Show in December of that year. The new VT1300C bikes used updated versions of the VTX1300 powertrain and brakes; but with unusual frame geometry, new suspension components and bodywork designed collaboratively by Honda R&D; Americas (HRA) and Honda's Asaka R&D; Center (HGA) in Japan. The carburetor that had been used on the VTX1300 engines was replaced with fuel injection (PGM-FI) for the VT1300C, and the new engines also received new cam profiles and a redesigned exhaust system. Exhaust emission controls included secondary air injection, the PGM-FI system and two catalytic converters. The Fury's design went beyond the domain of traditional Honda cruisers and onto full-out chopper turf, having austere bodywork on a faux-hardtail frame with a high-mounted steering head and long fork tubes that made the rake angle conspicuous at 38 degrees, The caster angle being 32 degrees with 6 degrees added into the steering yokes, A wide rear tire was paired with a narrow front wheel, and the two were spanned by the longest wheelbase for any Honda production motorcycle. Honda also offered an extra-cost version of the Fury with CBS and ABS. There were only cosmetic changes to the VT1300CX (aka VT13CX) model in years 2011 through 2013, and the Fury remains in the Honda lineup for 2014. While the Fury name was not used in all markets, Honda sold the VT1300CX internationally, including Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa, the UK and Northern Ireland, as well as the UAE and the GCC states. Motorcycle Cruiser magazine named the Honda Fury as their \\"2010 Cruiser of the Year.\\" In 2011, the Visordown website included the Fury in their list of \\"Top 7 cruisers with huge engines\\", despite the fact that the Honda's engine was the smallest of the lot. Beyond the chopper-style Fury, the VT1300C line offered three conventional cruiser models for 2010, all of which remain in the lineup for 2014: Sabre, Interstate and Stateline. Honda previously used both the Interstate and Sabre names for other models, the most recent being the VT1100C2 Shadow Sabre. In contrast to the Fury, the 2010 Sabre emphasized function over form with a less extreme seating position, narrower handlebar and lower steering head, making the VT1300CS (aka VT13CS) a fairly typical cruiser design, competing with other mid-size cruisers such as the Star Stryker. Front forks on the Sabre were shorter as a consequence of the lower steering head, and so they did not need the large-diameter tubes used on the Fury. The Sabre had slightly more travel in its rear mono-shock and a steel swingarm rather than aluminum, plus a larger fuel tank that incorporated an instrument panel. The VT1300CS wheelbase was about an inch shorter that the Fury's (but 4.5 inches longer than the old VTX1300C). Of the three 2010 cruisers, The VT1300CR Stateline was the entry-level bike, by virtue of its lower price. It was also a more touring oriented bike, thanks to its wider seat, pull-back handlebars and larger, more valanced fenders. The Stateline used the same suspension and fuel tank as the Sabre. The VT1300CT Interstate used the same bodywork and running gear as the Stateline, but with additional amenities for touring, such as a windshield, saddlebags, floorboards for the rider and covers for the fork tubes. ABS was not available on the 2010 Interstate, the only model in the VT1300C line to not offer that option, however, Honda included the ABS option starting with the 2012 model year. The VT1300CT Interstate's competitors were other mid-size Baggers, such as the Yamaha V Star 1300 tourer and Suzuki Boulevard C90T touring cruiser.

Wiseman (born 17 September 1966) is a Professor of the Public Understanding of Psychology at the University of Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom. He has written several best-selling popular psychology books that have been translated into over 30 languages. He has given keynote addresses to The Royal Society, The Swiss Economic Forum, Google and Amazon. He is a fellow for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and a patron of Humanists UK. Wiseman is also the creator of the YouTube channel Quirkology. Early life and education Wiseman was born and raised in Luton. His mother a seamstress and his father an engineer, he learned his trade as a teenage magician working the crowds in Covent Garden. At 18 he continued as a street performer and went to University College London to study psychology, partly because it \\"was right around the corner\\". He shared accommodation as a student with Adrian Owen, later also to become a psychologist. In his years as a street performer he learned how to adapt or get out of what you are doing because \\"Sometimes you would start your act and after five minutes there was no audience.\\" He moved to Edinburgh where he obtained his PhD in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh for research supervised by Robert L. Morris. He went from there to the University of Hertfordshire, becoming Britain's first professor in the Public Understanding of Psychology. In his early years at the University of Hertfordshire, Wiseman partnered with Simon Singh on a BBC segment about lying for the National Science Week. The segment spanned TV, radio and print and featured a \\"politician making a statement, and letting the public vote on whether they thought this figure was telling the truth in each medium.\\" It was the first time that Wiseman and Singh met. From the beginning, the two got along well and on Singh's idea, ended up creating a show together called Theatre of Science. The show aimed to deliver science to the audience in an entertaining manner. Wiseman describes how one stunt involved standing in a cage between two Tesla coils while lightning struck the cage. Wiseman ended up writing The Luck Factor in part due to Singh as well. With the success of Singh's book, Fermat's Last Theorem, Singh introduced Wiseman to his agent and encouraged him to write a similar book in the psychology arena, which led to The Luck Factor. Career and research Psychological research Wiseman is known for his critical examination and frequent debunking of unusual phenomena, including reports of paranormal phenomena. He is a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI). His research has been published in numerous academic journals, reported at various conferences, and featured on television. Wiseman has studied the principles of good and bad luck, publishing the results in the self-help book The Luck Factor. He showed that both good and bad luck result from measurable habits; for example, lucky people, by expecting good luck, might expend more effort in their endeavours, resulting in more success, reinforcing their belief in good luck. Lucky people are outgoing and observant and therefore have many more chance encounters than unlucky people, each of which could bring a lucky opportunity. Moreover, lucky people are more likely to look on the bright side of 'bad' encounters. In a mental exercise describing being shot during a bank robbery, lucky people considered themselves lucky not to have been killed while unlucky people considered themselves unlucky to have been shot. Public engagement Much of Wiseman's work tends to be oblique, as he prefers to make people go outside, discuss, research and think about the implications of his work rather than trying to convey his points in a 45-minute talk. So instead of talking directly about eyewitness testimony in law he would set something up that looked like it, something like the colour changing card trick. In this mind set he has presented keynote addresses to organisations around the world and in well known forums and congresses like the Swiss Economic Forum and ESOMAR Congress. Much of this work has involved helping organisation become more successful by embracing the lucky mind-set. In 2001 Wiseman led LaughLab, an international experiment to find the world's funniest joke. The winning joke described a caller to emergency services who shoots his friend who has collapsed to comply with the instruction \\"First, let's make sure he's dead\\". The experiment also explored regional and cultural variations in humour. These public psychology experiments ‚Äì such as enlisting people to name, and rate, their favourite gags in the search for the world's funniest jokes ‚Äì have drawn hundreds of thousands of participants and plenty of press. In 2011, Wiseman wrote the first section of a collaborative story at Libboo in an attempt to produce a full-length novel in two months. The final result of this experiment, was a novel called, Paradox: The Curious Life, and Mysterious Death, of Mr Joseph Wheeler. In 2013 Richard Wiseman became the first guest curator at Edinburgh's International Science Festival. He participated in the festival with \\"Richard Wiseman's Beginners Guide to... Climate Change\\". In 2014 he does a repeat of his 'Beginners Guide to' but this time with 3 different talks: * \\"Richard Wiseman's Beginners Guide to... Fermat's Last Theorem\\" with writer and broadcaster Simon Singh. * \\"Richard Wiseman's Beginners Guide to... Astrobiology\\" with Imperial College's Dr Zita Martins. * \\"Richard Wiseman's Beginners Guide to... the Earth\\" with earth scientist and broadcaster Hermione Cockburn (BBC). Wiseman has also become a content creator on YouTube after uploading a video of the colour changing card trick in 2007 that has 6. 5 million views as of April 2020. He is best known for his \\"Bets You Will Always Win\\" series, which has amassed over 60 million views throughout 10 videos. On 7 January 2014, Wiseman uploaded a video to a new channel called \\"59 Seconds\\" in promotion of his book of the same name. Wiseman is a patron of Humanists UK and appeared in the Nine Lessons and Carols for Godless People Christmas stage show organised by the New Humanist. He is also a Distinguished Supporter of Humanist Society Scotland. In 2017 Wiseman interviewed Richard Dawkins at CSIcon Las Vegas 2017 covering topics on evolution, extra terrestrials and god. Edinburgh Secret Society The Edinburgh Secret Society organises events for those of a curious disposition. These include verbal, theatrical and experimental presentations intended to inform, entertain and bewilder. This group, as the name states, tends to be low key and has appeared in very few news outlets. The Society motto is 'The king cannot be saved, the king cannot make custard', which is one of many things the group won't openly say the meaning of. It is run by Peter Lamont, friend and colleague, and Richard Wiseman having events involving The Filmhouse, the British Science Association, Edinburgh's World of Illusions, and The Edinburgh International Science Festival. Through the Edinburgh Secret Society Wiseman has found a new following, hosting evenings of irreverent talks and entertainment on topics including self-help and dying. In February 2011 they staged 'An Evening of Death' in A Victorian Anatomy Theatre at the University of Edinburgh, an event that sold out its 250 tickets within minutes. Teaching Wiseman is a professor in \\"public psychology\\" at the University of Hertfordshire who divides his time between London and Edinburgh. He is a skeptic who does not believe in extrasensory perception or prayer and who, as a former magician, rejects the purported supernatural experiences reported in seances conducted in darkened rooms where every kind of trickery is available. Media appearances Wiseman's research has been featured on over 150 television programmes, including Horizon, Equinox and World in Action. He is regularly heard on BBC Radio 4, including appearances on Start the Week, Midweek and the Today programme. Wiseman also makes numerous appearances on some British television shows; in The Real Hustle he explains the psychology behind many of the scams and confidence tricks; in Mind Games he's a regular team captain of a panel game of puzzles, anagrams and conundrums; and in People Watchers, a hidden-camera show examining human behaviour. Besides being interviewed in several of these television programmes, he was a creative consultant in an episode of Your Bleeped Up Brain and a researcher of the documentary Unlawful Killing. Feature articles about his work have regularly appeared in The Times, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian. Wiseman's 2011 book, Paranormality: Why We See What Isn't There was electronically self-published in the United States, as Wiseman was told by American publishers there was no interest in scepticism. In 2011, Wiseman wrote the first section of a collaborative story at Libboo in an attempt to produce a full-length novel in two months. The final result of this experiment, was a novel called, Paradox: The Curious Life, and Mysterious Death, of Mr Joseph Wheeler. Focus on the paranormal Wiseman is known for his critical examination and frequent debunking of unusual phenomena, including reports of paranormal phenomena. He is a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI). His research has been published in numerous academic journals, reported at various conferences, and featured on television. In 2004, he took part in a preliminary test of Natasha Demkina, a young Russian woman who claims to have a special vision that allows her to see inside of people's bodies and diagnose illnesses. The test, whose validity has been disputed by Demkina's supporters, was featured in the Discovery Channel documentary, The Girl with X-Ray Eyes. Wiseman has published studies on anomalistic psychology and the psychology of paranormal belief. He is the author of the book titled Paranormality: Why We See What Isn't There (2011) which takes a psychological approach to paranormal phenomena. The book offers its readers tools to investigate paranormal claims using QR Codes, which Wiseman saw as \\"exciting use of new media\\" to allow people to see footage and make up their minds themselves. In 2020, Wiseman, illustrator Jordan Collver and writer Rik Worth created Hocus Pocus, an interactive comic-book series that \\"promotes skepticism and critical thinking\\". The first issue focuses on Victorian performer and mind reader Washington Irving Bishop and pioneer of parapsychology Joseph Banks Rhine. The second issue features the Fox sisters and s√©ances. Dream:ON The App Wiseman launched the Dream:ON App at the Edinburgh International Science Festival 2012. It is developed and maintained by YUZA, a mobile experience team based in London. The app is powered by an engine which constantly monitors and adjusts the behaviour of Dream:ON; optimising the experience for the user. When the user enters the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep where dreaming is most common, the app delivers unique audio soundscapes which the subconscious is shown to respond to. \\"We have created a new way of carrying out mass participation experiments. We still know relatively little about the science of dreaming and this app may provide a real breakthrough in changing how we dream, and record and track those dreams.\\" ‚Äì Professor Richard Wiseman The app is also a social experiment: in the morning it presents users with a graph of their movement during the night, allows users to tag any friends who appeared in their dreams via Facebook and invites them to post a short description of their dreams to an experimental \\"Dream Bank\\", creating the world's largest dream experiment. The Good Magic Awards In collaboration with the Good Thinking Society, Wiseman set up The Good Magic Awards. These awards recognize and reward performers that use magic tricks to improve the lives of people in disadvantaged groups, charities, community groups, hospital patients, and others struggling with physical and psychological challenges. The awards were announced on March 17, 2020, and were awarded for the first time on May 5, 2020..

As the elder child and heir of Friedrich Alfred Krupp she was the sole proprietor of the Krupp industrial empire from 1902 to 1943, although her husband, Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, ran the company in her name. In 1943 ownership of the company was transferred to her son Alfried. Biography Bertha Krupp was born in Essen, home of the Krupp family and their company since the 16th century. Her mother was Baroness Margrethe von Enden. At the time of Bertha's birth the company was owned and managed by her grandfather Alfred. Upon his death the following year, her father Friedrich inherited ownership and control. Her sister Barbara was born in 1887 (d. 1972), but the absence of a male heir put the future of the company in doubt. Friedrich Krupp died in 1902, leaving Bertha as the heiress to the Krupp interests. However, it was considered unsuitable for a woman to exercise control over the vast Krupp coal, steel and state-connected armaments empire. In 1907, therefore, Kaiser Wilhelm II personally led a search for a suitable husband for Bertha. The Kaiser then successfully proposed Gustav von Bohlen und Halbach, a professional diplomat of good family and a familiar figure at the Kaiser's court. They were married on May 7 and Bertha became sole owner of the company with Gustav adding the name Krupp to his surname and assuming executive control of the company. Barbara received a large cash settlement in lieu. Gustav and Bertha had eight children: Alfried (1907‚Äì67), Arnold (1908-1909), Claus (1910‚Äì1940), Irmgard (1912‚Äì1998), Berthold (1913‚Äì87), Harald (1916‚Äì85), Waldtraut (1920‚Äì2005) and Eckbert (1922‚Äì1945). Of these only Alfried as the eldest son took the surname Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach. The others used the surname von Bohlen und Halbach. Claus and Eckbert were killed on active service in World War II, and Harald spent ten years in captivity in the Soviet Union. During World War I, the Krupp company manufactured large mortars that the German army used to bombard forts in Belgium and France. German troops nicknamed these various names of which Dicke Bertha (\\"Big Bertha\\") after Bertha Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach. Allied troops used the translated name, \\"Big Bertha,\\" to refer to all German long-range artillery, particularly those that shelled Paris in 1918.Triana, J. Ruiz, J. The secret weapon of the great war, Revista Cubana de F√≠sica, 35(1) 2018, p√°gs. 60-66. However, \\"Big Bertha\\" entered the lexicon due to the Paris Gun, a piece of German artillery which was constructed of three artillery barrels welded together. It had a range of 75 miles and its appearance was a major surprise to Parisians in 1917 who had previously only come under attack from German aircraft, since previous artillery reached a maximum of thirty miles. After Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach suffered a stroke in 1941, his health declined sharply. In 1943 Adolf Hitler issued a decree known as the Lex Krupp, which passed full ownership of the Krupp empire‚Äîwhich was vital to Germany's war effort‚Äîfrom Bertha to her son Alfried, who then assumed control of the company. Bertha took Gustav to a family estate in Tyrol, where they remained until the end of the war. In 1945 Gustav was indicted as a war criminal, but was declared medically unfit to stand trial. He died in 1950. Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach was indicted on charges of crimes against humanity in relation to the Krupp company's use and mistreatment of concentration camp inmates as slave labour in Krupp factories‚Äîparticularly at the Berthawerk, a factory near the Markstadt forced labour camp, which was named after Bertha. He was sentenced to twelve years in prison and the confiscation of all his property. He served five years in prison before being freed in 1951 when the US High Commissioner in Germany, John J. McCloy, granted clemency, after deciding that there was no danger of a Nazi revival. In 1951 Bertha Krupp returned with Alfried to Essen, where Alfried resumed control of the company and rapidly restored it to a dominant position in the German economy, (although it no longer made armaments). She had become a much- loved figure in the city, known for her charitable work and her frequent visits to injured or ill Krupp workers and their families. Bertha Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach died in Essen on 21 September 1957. She was buried in the family crypt outside the city. Legacy By the time of Bertha's death she had 5 living children, and many grandchildren, but only Alfried and his only child Arndt had the right to use the Krupp surname. Arndt (1938‚Äì1986) had, in 1966 refused to take his family's inheritance, so he lost right to the Krupp surname. Because of that with the death of Bertha her son Alfried in 1967 the Krupp surname will become extinct. (Any members of the family with the Krupp name are cousins whose common ancestor dates back to the early 19th century or earlier.)

This decree was repealed by the law of the Vichy collaborationist government of 16 August 1940.\\"Abrogation du d√©cret-loi interdisant les insultes raciales\\", Loi du 27 ao√ªt 1940, portant abrogation du d√©cret-loi du 21 avril 1939 modifiant la loi du 29 juillet 1991, Journal officiel, 30 August 1940 The decree came again into force after the Liberation of France in 1944 by an ordinance of 9 August 1944 repealing most of the Vichy legislation.Gilles Devers, \\"Vichy: L'antis√©mitisme l√©galis√©\\", Actualit√© du droit, 25 July 2010\\"Ordonnance du 9 ao√ªt 1944 relative au r√©tablissement de la l√©galit√© r√©publicaine sur le territoire continental\\", Journal officiel Pleven Law (1972) Ren√© Pleven, center-rightformer leader (1947-1953), before Fran√ßois Mitterrand, of the centrist Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance, then affiliated to various center-right splinter parliamentary groups Justice Minister in the Chaban-Delmas and Messmer governments in 1969-1973, proposed in 1972 a new law against racism, which was unanimously adopted by the National Assembly, the 72-546 1 July 1972 Law pertaining to the fight against racism. This law came as a requisite after France's ratification in 1971 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It differed considerably from the 1939 decree, which permitted only the prosecutor's office to initiate a procedure, whereas the 1972 law allowed any representative organization to initiate a legal procedure. Legal challenges After Robert Faurisson was removed from his university chair under the Gayssot Act, he challenged it as a violation of his right to freedom of expression under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The Human Rights Committee upheld the condemnation of Faurisson, but mentioned that the Gayssot Act may be too broad.Communication No 550/1993 : France. 16/12/96.

It has a rich history within continental philosophy, beginning in the 1920s and 1930s and running through critical theory, Lacanian psychoanalysis, and post-structuralism. Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud Both Marx and Freud were Jewish atheists who developed distinctive critiques of religion. In his 1965 book Freud and Philosophy: An Essay on Interpretation, the French philosopher Paul Ric≈ìur compared the two (together with Friedrich Nietzsche), characterizing their common method as the \\"hermeneutics of suspicion\\". Certain philosophers have revised Marx's concept of commodity fetishism in the light of Freud's concept of sexual fetishism, theorizing a sexually charged relationships between a person and a manufactured object. Freud remained prolific up until his death in 1939. Civilization and Its Discontents, one of his most influential works (with particular relevance to socio-cultural and political issues), was published in 1930.  Emergence  The beginnings of Freudo-Marxist theorizing took place in the 1920s in Germany and the Soviet Union. The Soviet philosopher V. Yurinets and the Freudian analyst Siegfried Bernfeld both discussed the topic. The Soviet linguist Valentin Voloshinov, a member of the Bakhtin circle, began a Marxist critique of psychoanalysis in his 1925 article \\"Beyond the Social\\", which he developed more substantially in his 1927 book Freudianism: A Marxist Critique. In 1929, Wilhelm Reich‚Äôs Dialectical Materialism and Psychoanalysis was published in German and Russian in the bilingual communist theory journal . At the end of this line of thought can be considered Otto Fenichel's 1934 article Psychoanalysis as the Nucleus of a Future Dialectical-Materialistic Psychology which appeared in Reich's . One member of the Berlin group of Marxist psychoanalysts around Reich was Erich Fromm, who later brought Freudo-Marxist ideas into the exiled Frankfurt School led by Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno.  Wilhelm Reich  Wilhelm Reich in his mid-20s Wilhelm Reich\\"Wilhelm Reich is again the main pioneer in this field (an excellent, short introduction to his ideas can be found in Maurice Brinton's The Irrational in Politics). In Children of the Future, Reich made numerous suggestions, based on his research and clinical experience, for parents, psychologists, and educators striving to develop libertarian methods of child rearing. (He did not use the term \\"libertarian,\\" but that is what his methods are.) Hence, in this and the following sections we will summarise Reich's main ideas as well as those of other libertarian psychologists and educators who have been influenced by him, such as A.S. Neill and Alexander Lowen.\\" \\"J.6 What methods of child rearing do anarchists advocate?\\" in An Anarchist FAQ by Various Authors.\\"In an earlier article (‚ÄúSome Thoughts on Libertarianism,‚Äù Broadsheet No. 35), I argued that to define a position as ‚Äúanti-authoritarian‚Äù is not, in fact, to define the position at all ‚Äúbut merely to indicate a relationship of opposition to another position, the authoritarian one...On the psychoanalytic side, Wilhelm Reich (The Sexual Revolution, Peter Neville- Vision Press, London, 1951 Character Analysis, Orgone Institute Press, N.Y., 1945; and The Function of the Orgasm, Orgone Institute Press, N.Y., 1942) was preferred to Freud because, despite his own weaknesses ‚Äì his Utopian tendencies and his eventual drift into ‚Äúorgones‚Äù and ‚Äúbions‚Äù ‚Äì Reich laid more emphasis on the social conditions of mental events than did Freud (see, e.g., A.J.

Here a division developed between a more radical wing (including e.g. Waters and Grahame Harrison) and a more conservative wing (including e.g. Stove and Eric Dowling). The general orientation of these meetings may be judged from the fact that when Harry Hooton proposed \\"Anarchist\\" and some of the conservative proposed \\"Democratic\\" as the name for the new Society, both were rejected and \\"Libertarian Society\\" was adopted as an acceptable title. Likewise then accepted as the motto for this Society - and continued by the later Libertarian society - was the early Marx quotation used by Wilhelm Reich as the motto for his The Sexual Revolution, vis: \\"Since it is not for us to create a plan for the future that will hold for all time, all the more surely what we contemporaries have to do is the uncompromising critical evaluation of all that exists, uncompromising in the sense that our criticism fears neither its own results nor the conflict with the powers that be.\\" \\"SYDNEY LIBERTARIANISM & THE PUSH\\" by A.J. Baker, in Broadsheet, No 81, March, 1975. (abridged) was an Austrian psychoanalyst, a member of the second generation of psychoanalysts after Freud, and a radical psychiatrist. He was the author of several influential books and essays, most notably Character Analysis (1933), The Mass Psychology of Fascism (1933), and The Sexual Revolution (1936).That he was one of the most radical figures in psychiatry, see Sheppard 1973. *Danto 2007, p. 43: \\"Wilhelm Reich, the second generation psychoanalyst perhaps most often associated with political radicalism ...\\" *Turner 2011, p. 114: \\"[Reich's mobile clinic was] perhaps the most radical, politically engaged psychoanalytic enterprise to date.\\" *For the publication and significance of The Mass Psychology of Fascism and Character Analysis, see Sharaf 1994, pp. 163‚Äì164, 168. *For Character Analysis being an important contribution to psychoanalytic theory, see: :*Young-Bruehl 2008, p. 157: \\"Reich, a year and a half younger than Anna Freud, was the youngest instructor at the Training Institute, where his classes on psychoanalytic technique, later presented in a book called Character Analysis, were crucial to his whole group of contemporaries.\\" :*Sterba 1982, p. 35: \\"This book [Character Analysis] serves even today as an excellent introduction to psychoanalytic technique. In my opinion, Reich's understanding of and technical approach to resistance prepared the way for Anna Freud's Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence (1936).\\" :*Guntrip 1961, p. 105: \\"... the two important books of the middle 1930s, Character Analysis (1935) by Wilhelm Reich and The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence (1936) by Anna Freud.\\" *For more on the influence of The Mass Psychology of Fascism, see Kirkpatrick 1947, Burgess 1947; Bendix 1947; and Turner 2011, p. 152. His work on character contributed to the development of Anna Freud's The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence (1936), and his idea of muscular armour--the expression of the personality in the way the body moves-- shaped innovations such as body psychotherapy, Fritz Perls's Gestalt therapy, Alexander Lowen's bioenergetic analysis, and Arthur Janov's primal therapy. His writing influenced generations of intellectuals: during the 1968 student uprisings in Paris and Berlin, students scrawled his name on walls and threw copies of The Mass Psychology of Fascism at the police.For Anna Freud, see Bugental, Schneider and Pierson 2001, p. 14: \\"Anna Freud's work on the ego and the mechanisms of defense developed from Reich's early research (A.

Critical theory Frankfurt School The Frankfurt School, from the Institute for Social Research, took up the task of choosing what parts of Marx's thought might serve to clarify social conditions which Marx himself had never seen. They drew on other schools of thought to fill in Marx's perceived omissions. Max Weber exerted a major influence, as did Freud. In the Institute's extensive (ed. Max Horkheimer, Paris 1936), Erich Fromm authored the social- psychological part. Another new member of the institute was Herbert Marcuse, who would become famous during the 1950s in the US. =Herbert Marcuse= Eros and Civilization is one of Marcuse's best known early works. Written in 1955, it is an attempted dialectical synthesis of Marx and Freud whose title alludes to Freud's Civilization and its Discontents. Marcuse's vision of a non-repressive society (which runs rather counter to Freud's conception of society as naturally and necessarily repressive), based on Marx and Freud, anticipated the values of 1960s countercultural social movements. In the book, Marcuse writes about the social meaning of biology ‚Äì history seen not as a class struggle, but fight against repression of our instincts. He argues that capitalism (if never named as such) is preventing us from reaching the non- repressive society \\"based on a fundamentally different experience of being, a fundamentally different relation between man and nature, and fundamentally different existential relations\\". =Erich Fromm= Erich Fromm, once a member of the Frankfurt School, left the group at the end of the 1930s. The culmination of Fromm's social and political philosophy was his book The Sane Society, published in 1955, which argued in favor of humanist, democratic socialism. Building primarily upon the works of Marx, Fromm sought to re- emphasise the ideal of personal freedom, missing from most Soviet Marxism, and more frequently found in the writings of classic liberals. Fromm's brand of socialism rejected both Western capitalism and Soviet communism, which he saw as dehumanizing and bureaucratic social structures that resulted in a virtually universal modern phenomenon of alienation. Frantz Fanon The French West Indian psychiatrist and philosopher Frantz Fanon drew on both psychoanalytic and Marxist theory in his critique of colonialism. His seminal works in this area include Black Skin, White Masks (1952) and The Wretched of the Earth (1961). Lacanianism Jacques Lacan was a philosophically-minded French psychoanalyst, whose perspective gained widespread influence in French psychiatry and psychology. Lacan saw himself as loyal to and rescuing Freud's legacy. He inspired new cross-fertilisation of Freudian and Marxist ideas. Louis Althusser The French Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser is widely known as a theorist of ideology, and his best-known essay is Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses: Notes Toward an Investigation. The essay establishes the concept of ideology, also based on Gramsci's theory of hegemony. Whereas hegemony is ultimately determined entirely by political forces, ideology draws on Freud's and Lacan's concepts of the unconscious and mirror-phase respectively, and describes the structures and systems that allow us to meaningfully have a concept of the self. These structures, for Althusser, are both agents of repression and inevitable ‚Äì it is impossible to escape ideology, to not be subjected to it. The distinction between ideology and science or philosophy is not assured once for all by the epistemological break (a term borrowed from Gaston Bachelard): this \\"break\\" is not a chronologically-determined event, but a process. Instead of an assured victory, there is a continuous struggle against ideology: \\"Ideology has no history\\". Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek in 2008 His essay Contradiction and Overdetermination borrows the concept of overdetermination from psychoanalysis, in order to replace the idea of \\"contradiction\\" with a more complex model of multiple causality in political situations (an idea closely related to Gramsci's concept of hegemony).  Cornelius Castoriadis  Greek-French philosopher, psychoanalyst, and social critic Cornelius Castoriadis also followed up on the work of Lacan.  Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek  The Slovenian philosopher Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek has developed since the late 1980s a line of thought which uses Lacanian psychoanalysis, Hegelian philosophy and Marxism. Althusser is also among his references. His The Sublime Object of Ideology deals with the original Freudo- Marxist perspective. Post-structuralism Major French philosophers associated with post-structuralism, post-modernism, and/or deconstruction, including Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Derrida, engaged deeply with both Marxism and psychoanalysis. Most notably, Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari collaborated on the theoretical work Capitalism and Schizophrenia in two volumes: Anti-Oedipus (1972) and A Thousand Plateaus (1980).

It was built as a place of worship for the people on a hillside in a manufacturing suburb in Santa Coloma de Cervell√≥, near Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain). Col√≤nia G√ºell was the brainchild of Count Eusebi de G√ºell; who enlisted the help of architect Antoni Gaud√≠ in 1898. However, work was not started until 1908, 10 years after commission. The plan for the building consisted of constructing two naves, an upper and a lower, two towers, and one forty-meter-high central dome. In 1914, the G√ºell family halted construction due to the death of Count G√ºell. At the time, the lower nave was almost complete so between the years of 1915 and 1917, it was completed and readied for use. The Church is one of the seven properties Gaud√≠ built near Barcelona that are Unesco World Heritage Sites. Collectively, these sites are known as the Works of Antoni Gaud√≠, and show his, \\"exceptional creative contribution to the development of architecture and building technology in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\\"  History  At the age of 28, the Church of Col√≤nia G√ºell was one of several commissions Guad√≠ received from Count G√ºell in the suburb of Santa Coloma de Cervell√≥.  Planning  To start the designing process of the church, Gaud√≠ used his very unique process of gravity and rope, known as a funicular system. As seen in the planning of La Sagrada Familia, Gaud√≠ hung hemp ropes attached to lead-filled sacks from the ceiling. By doing this, it allowed him to reproduce the curves of the church at a 1:10 scale. Guad√≠ also used canvas sheets to imitate the vaults and walls of the structure. By weighing down the ropes with lead-filled sacks, it allowed him to see the loads that would be exerted on the actual structure. To turn this hanging structure into his actual design, Guad√≠ photographed his model, flipped the image, and traced over it while adding some ornament and design. All that remains of the model for Church of Col√≤nia G√ºell is an image in a book written by architect Josep Francesc R√°fols i Fontanals. This method of planning led to the development of a new architectural vocabulary, such as hyberbolic paraboloids and hyperboloids, which are prominent elements in many of Gaudi's designs.  The Crypt  The crypt portion of the church, constructed from 1908 to 1915, was the only segment of the church that was fully completed. It was built partially below ground, due to being on a hillside, and it was designed so that it would feel like it belonged in the surrounding nature. There are pillars on the exterior of the crypt, made of many bricks, while others were made of a solid block of stone. The roof of the structure has a geometric shape that is morphed by the connecting of the various pillars. The crypt is very dimly lit, due to it being built partially underground since the structure is on a hillside. There are however, 22 lead stained glass windows in the crypt, to let in some colorful lighting.  The Chapel  Although it remains unfinished, the chapel is a very important aspect of the church. The designs of the chapel is similar to that of the Sagrada Familia. This is a common theme seen throughout the church, since Gaud√≠ used it in preparation for the building of the Sagrada Familia. He tested many of his ideas and theories here, since G√ºell gave him the liberty of being as creative as possible. The shape of the worship area was planned in extensive detail, right down to the pews. All of the furniture in the Church was designed by Gaud√≠ himself, and have been preserved. Very few pieces of his furniture have been saved, though some examples are still seen in the Sagrada Familia and private homes. Recent history In 2000, local architects set about repairing the crypt. This took away aspects of the unfinished nature of the buildings. However, it did present a more tourist-friendly structure, and now visitors can stand on the roof, which would have been the church floor.

Named for the Pago de Monte Grande founded by a Spanish Empire Conquistador, the town initially grew around tala and omb√∫ forests, to which vineyards and peach trees were later added. The Sociedad Coni, Sansinena y C√≠a., prominent Avellaneda-area saladero operators, purchased the land from the Fair family in 1889; Governor M√°ximo Paz signed a bill establishing Monte Grande on April 3 of that year. Among Monte Grande's first significant businesses were kiln opened by Coni & Sansinena, and the Bon March√© market. Esteban Echeverr√≠a Partido was established in 1913, with Monte Grande as its county seat. A number of meat packing plants operated here during much of the 20th century, though these eventually closed. A Coca-Cola bottling plant and the Sof√≠a Santamarina Hospital thus became two of the largest employers in the city, which became a bedroom community with a services-oriented economy. In Monte Grande, there was an oversea telegraphy radio station.

Geography It is about south from Pickering by road and about north from Malton, just west of the A169 road. Adjacent to the village lies one of the most popular amusement parks in England, Flamingo Land Theme Park and Zoo. A gas field nearby, discovered in 1985, pipes gas to the Knapton Generating Station. The fields were bought by Kelt UK Ltd (owned by Kelt Energy plc and Edinburgh Oil & Gas plc) from Candecca Resources Ltd (owned by BP) in 1992. History Main Street in 1976 The place-name 'Kirby Misperton' conflates the names of two adjoining places. Kirby is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as Chirchebi. This means 'church village' in Old Norse. Misperton is also first attested in the Domesday Book, where it appears as Mispeton. This may mean 'foggy hill' or 'dung hill', possibly from mistbeorg in Old English. The two names first appear together in early Yorkshire charters, as Mispertona Kirkeby circa 1090, and as Kircabimispertun in 1157.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.279. The Domesday Book recorded a total population of 14 households (13 villagers and 1 priest) with a total tax assessed of 2.8 geld units. The Lord in 1066 was recorded as Thorbrand, son of Karli and from 1086 the Canons of York (St. Peter). The Tenant-in-chief in 1086 was Berengar of Tosny.  Kirby Misperton Church  St Laurence's Church The Anglican parish church is dedicated to St Laurence and is part of the Benefice of Kirby Misperton, which is made up of the parishes of Kirby Misperton, Normanby and Salton, and the Benefice of Middleton, which is made up of the parishes of Middleton, Newton and Sinnington. The church has stood in the village since the 9th century. Incorporated in the stone work of the chancel walls are a number of 'wheeled crosses' and fragments of a tomb headstone, dating from the late Anglian period which came to an end with the Danish invasion of Northumbria in 867 AD. Kirby Misperton is thought to have been one of the few stone-built churches to have existed in Yorkshire at this time when \\"there was not a stone church in all the land, but the custom was to build them all of wood.\\" The church was entirely rebuilt in the 15th century, and no part of the present building has survived since before that reconstruction, although the Norman chancel arch was not removed until the late 19th century. The chancel was rebuilt by rector George Body in 1857 and designed by Charles Hodgson Fowler. In 1886 the East window commemorating the family of rector Charles John Symson was removed to its present position near the pulpit and replaced by that given in memory of Squire and Mrs Robert Tindall. The window above the altar depicting the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Infant Christ is a memorial to two former rectors and was dedicated on the feast of the Purification in 1949 by Eric Milner-White, Dean of York. The crucifix on the Lady Chapel altar came from the disused Mission Church at Ryton. The carved oak lecturn, at the base of which may be seen the figure of St Laurence, was given by Miss Jane Tindall of Kirby Misperton Hall, in 1891. The baptistery is dedicated to the memory of Canon F.W. Drake, rector 1914‚Äì1928. On the walls are baptismal rolls dating back to the early 1920s. The tower, of which the lower half is from the 15th century, houses three bells, recast by Mears of Newcastle at the expense of Charles Duncombe, 1st Baron Feversham, to commemorate the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838. In 1891 the present church clock, made by Potts of Leeds, was given by the rector W. H. Hutchings. Alexander Neville was a cleric at Kirby Misperton and rose to become the Archbishop of York, was subsequently deposed, and exiled to France, where, he ended his days as a parish priest in Louvain. Other notable rectors include John Thornborough who became chaplain to Queen Elizabeth I, was one of the translators of the Authorised Version of the Bible, and died Bishop of Worcester at the age of 90 in 1641. His immediate successor, Peter Rollock, was a member of the Scottish Privy Council, and sometime Titular Bishop of Dunkeld. In the early 19th century the Rev'd. and Hon Augustus Duncombe held the Living for seven years and became Dean of York in 1858. George Body, who rebuilt the chancel, was a noted preacher and writer in his day and one of the leaders of Anglo-Catholicism.  Gas industry  Oil and gas exploration has a history in North Yorkshire dating back to the 1930s. In 1937 the first well was drilled at Eskdale on the North York Moors and in 1938 gas was discovered in a deeper second well. There was much oil and gas exploration in the Vale of Pickering during the 1970s and 1980s. A significant number of seismic surveys were shot and several fields were discovered, some of which are still in production today. During the 1980s the fields of Kirby Misperton and Marishes were discovered. Well KM-1 was drilled in March 1985 and found gas at two levels. Since 2000 eleven new wells have been drilled in North Yorkshire with drilling at Ebberston, Marishes, Pickering and Kirby Misperton. Third Energy Onshore drilled the KM8 well (located about 500m WSW of the village of Kirby Misperton), within the Kirby Misperton gas field, during 2013. Samples were taken at several different depths to assess the hydrocarbon potential. Analysis of the gas bearing zones in the deeper Bowland section concluded that they should be appraised further. To assess their commercial potential, Third Energy applied for a hydraulic fracturing permit to stimulate gas flow from these inter-bedded sandstone and shale sections. The planning application C3/15/00971/CPO (NY/2015/0233/ENV) submitted to North Yorkshire County Council in 2015 for the proposed hydraulic fracturing operation was approved by the Planning Committee on 23 May 2016; Friends of the Earth and a local pressure group, Frack Free Ryedale, applied for judicial review of the decision, but this application was rejected in December 2016. In October 2017, Third Energy Onshore announced its intention to begin fracking within weeks. 2018 fracking suspension In November 2017, opponents to the fracking operation called upon Third Energy to confirm its financial standing before commencing work; the company was over a month late in filing its accounts (which were eventually filed on 1 February 2018). In January 2018, Business Secretary Greg Clark said permission for Third Energy to frack would not be granted until financial checks had been completed by the Infrastructure and Projects Authority, amid concerns about its resilience and ability to fund clean-up costs. The 2016 accounts of its wholly owned subsidiary Third Energy UK Gas Ltd showed it made a ¬£3.4 million loss (down from a ¬£3.85 million loss in 2015), but owed ¬£44.7 million to its ultimate parent company, Third Energy Holdings, based in the Cayman Islands. Third Energy began removing equipment from the site in early February 2018, as questions about the company's finances and management continued, including about the September 2017 appointments of former Carillion interim CEO Keith Cochrane as non-executive chairman, and of Jitesh Gadhia, a Conservative party peer and donor, as a non- executive director. Cochrane and Gadhia resigned as directors in September 2018. In October 2018, owner Barclays was reported to be considering selling Third Energy Onshore rather than invest a further ¬£5m to make the Kirby Misperton fracking site fully functional in the next 12 months. In April 2019, the Kirby Misperton site remained dormant over a year after Third Energy Onshire vacated it; the company had earlier said it would drill at the site before the end of 2019. In July 2019, Third Energy Onshore and two sister companies were sold to York Energy, a subsidiary of US-owned Alpha Energy, raising fears that fracking preparations might be restarted.

It was released worldwide for the Xbox in 2003.  Plot  Kung Fu Chaos often breaks the fourth wall. The entire game is about the player controlling a selection of characters making a kung fu film. The actions of these characters are then processed as films and the player can watch them. Although the game is centered on a classic kung fu film, it has certain characters and levels that do not belong in a martial arts film (such as a city under attack by aliens).  Characters   Original main  * Master Sho Yu: An elderly martial arts master. *Ninja Fu Hiya: A blue ninja. Prized possession is his signed poster of Bruce Lee. *Monkey: A parody of the Monkey King from Journey to the West. Became immortal after urinating on the Mountain king's favorite tablecloth. *Lucy Cannon: A parody of blaxploitation heroines such as Foxy Brown and Cleopatra Jones. Prized possession is Babydoll, her shotgun. *Xui Tan Sour: A young martial artist who seeks to avenge her parents, who were killed by members of a rival circus, parodying the idea that in martial arts films, the hero/heroine is avenging their families' death from a rival, often a rival clan. *Chop & Styx: A samurai and baby pair that parodies Lone Wolf and Cub.  Original recurring  *Candi Roll: A roller-skating blonde. *Captain Won Ton: An overweight luchadore. Wrestler by day, justice avenger by the rest of the day. *Shao Ting: The film's loud and obnoxious director. He also serves as the final boss of the game. He sees himself as a womanizer, and after creating Kung Fu Chaos the Movie, with no plot whatsoever, he creates an experimental art film where he runs around naked for two hours chased by zombie nurses. Development Kung Fu Chaos is the first game developed by the Cambridge- based developer Just Add Monsters. The game's concept was co-created by design director Tameem Antoniades, producer Nina Kristensen, and technical director Mike Ball once the company was founded. According to Antoniades, the game was prototyped in three months using four to eight people. In early 2003, Just Add Monsters began working on a more mature sequel to the game titled Kung Fu Story. However, realizing it would be a difficult idea to sell an existing intellectual property (IP) to prospective publishers, they shifted their focus on developing for the next-generation of consoles. Specifically, they started work on a new IP, Heavenly Sword for the PlayStation 3. The company resurfaced in 2004 under the name Ninja Theory after it was purchased by former Argonaut Games CEO Jez San. Reception Kung Fu Chaos received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where the game was ported for release under the name on 29 May 2003, Famitsu gave it a score of one eight, one seven, one eight, and one seven, for a total of 30 out of 40. The game was included among the best Xbox party games by IGN in 2005.

Dickson Mounds is located near the center of this map in the upper part of the Middle Mississippi area. Dickson Mounds is a Native American settlement site and burial mound complex near Lewistown, Illinois. It is located in Fulton County on a low bluff overlooking the Illinois River. It is a large burial complex containing at least two cemeteries, ten superimposed burial mounds, and a platform mound. The Dickson Mounds site was founded by 800 CE and was in use until after 1250 CE. The site is named in honor of chiropractor Don Dickson, who began excavating it in 1927 and opened a private museum that formerly operated on the site. Its exhibition of the 237 uncovered skeletons uncovered and displayed by Dickson was closed in 1992 by then-Gov. Jim Edgar. Don Dickson was a chiropractor and discovered the burial mounds on his family farm. Instead of removing the bones, he only removed the dirt. He covered his excavation with a tent. He later replaced his tent with a building and set up a private museum.\\"Discover Dickson Mounds Museum.\\" Welcome to the Illinois State Museum--Illinois State Museum. Dickson Mounds Museum. Web. 09 Apr. 2012. . The Dickson Mounds Museum is a museum erected on the site in 1972 by the U.S. state of Illinois; it describes the life cycles and culture of Native Americans living in the Illinois River valley over a period of 12,000 years since the last Ice Age. The museum is part of the Illinois State Museum system.Note: This website mistakenly asserts that Dickson Mounds is a National Historic Site Native life site Ogden-Fettie Mound Group While the members of most hunter-gatherer cultures travel extensively or even practice a nomadic lifestyle, the exceptional productivity of the Illinois River valley in fish, shellfish and game made it possible for semi-permanent settlements to develop. Archaeological examination of these sites have generated significant insights into the living conditions of Native Americans over time and the levels of technology they possessed. A large parcel of the adjacent river bottomland is undergoing preservation and ecosystem restoration as part of the Emiquon Project. The Emiquon wetlands generated much of the food eaten by the people who lived on or near this blufftop site. In 2009, an excavation by Michigan State University turned up sherds of pottery, arrowheads and the foundations of houses and other structures that date back to about 1300 CE. Some of the people who lived here were actually buried in Dickson Mounds itself. Their skeletons were excavated and displayed to the public from the 1930s until 1992, when in a controversial move the burial display was resealed due to Native American concerns. It is estimated that there are at least 3,000 burials at this site. The earlier burials were in mounds that were still being built as late as the ninth century, while later burials were in cemeteries. This exemplifies the shift away from the earlier focus on burial mounds as the monumental foci of communities lacking large settlements to the later emphasis on platform mounds at the center of towns. Mississippians decentralized cemeteries, making their communities rather than their burial places the center of their lives. \\"One group of four Mississippian people buried together appear to have been sacrificed at the Dickson Site\\". Their heads were removed and replaced by pots. This was not a practice that would have been common earlier. After the sealing, the museum was renovated as a series of galleries that attempt to portray the history of the site. For example, the River Valley Gallery exhibition attempts to depict indigenous life patterns here since the close of the last Ice Age, while the \\"Reflections on Three Worlds\\" Gallery exhibition attempts to describe how scholars have used archeological findings to generate inductive evidence on the residents' life and culture. Excavators left 248 burials in place after exposure, and these were long displayed inside a specially built museum enclosure. The American Indian objections to the display led to its closure in 1992. After that, three excavated dwellings now remain open to visitors at the site and the museum displays chronicle prehistoric life in the region. Health and lifestyle Combined, the various burial sites at Dickson Mounds comprehensively represent all of the known eras of Native American culture in Illinois. Excavation and analysis of over eight hundred Native American skeletons from these burial sites indicate a transition from hunting and gathering to an agrarian economy and significant health changes in the population as a result of this transition. Earlier settlements at Dickson Mounds (950-1050 CE) indicate an economy based primarily on hunting and gathering. Hunting and gathering provided this population with a mixed and balanced diet. At this time, the population was small and autonomous, traded little with outsiders, and maintained only seasonal camps. From 1050-1175, Dickson Mounds underwent a transitional phase, moving towards a mixed economy of hunting and gathering combined with agriculture, particularly the cultivation of maize. The population was also developing more permanent settlements and trade networks. From 1175 onward to about 1350, the population size expanded significantly and developed complex permanent settlements. These changes can be attributed to the increased reliance on agriculture and expansion of long-distance trade during this period. The significant lifestyle changes from a small, nomadic, hunter- gatherer society to a large, sedentary, agrarian society resulted in major health changes among the population. After analyzing trends in bone growth, enamel development, lesions, and mortality, archaeologists determined that there was a major decline in health following the adoption and intensification of agriculture. Compared to the hunter-gatherers before them, skeletons of farmers at Dickson Mounds indicate a significant increase in enamel defects, iron-deficiency anemia, bone lesions, and degenerative spinal conditions. The decline in health of Dickson Mounds‚Äô population over time can be attributed to the increased reliance on agriculture, which led to a less varied and less nutritious diet, more strenuous physical labor in the fields, and more crowded permanent settlements that facilitated the spread of infectious diseases. Some also say the decline in health is due to the expansion of long-distance trade with larger economic systems, such as Cahokia, which resulted in exploitative relations in which residents of Dickson Mounds were giving away needed food for items of symbolic value. Social organization Analysis of mortuary behavior from excavations of burial sites at Dickson Mounds provides important insight into the social organization of early Native Americans. Dickson Mounds was a hierarchically organized society. The particular objects an individual was buried with largely indicate his or her social status. For example, an abundance of tools, copper ornaments, and objects made from imported raw materials suggest high rank of an individual. Burials containing pots, spoons, and beads are much more common and indicate a modest social rank. Age and sex were also visible determinants of status, which is uncommon in most hierarchically organized societies. Burials were clustered into distinct age- sex classes. For example, mature males with high-ranking status characterized one cluster of burials. Another cluster of burials contained individuals of younger age and lower status. Specific objects signified the status of the various age-sex groups. Whereas objects serving functional purposes (such as cutting or piercing) noted the status of men, cultural and religious artifacts along with ornamental items noted the status of females. Marine shells tended to note the status of children. Deep class divisions in the society at Dickson Mounds are also apparent through analysis of the health and heights of the individual skeletons. For example, skeletons from burials show children of an elite class tended to be taller and healthier compared to children from lower classes. This is most probably due to better diets and less strenuous labor requirements among the elite class. Trade Records show that Dickson Mounds was part of a complex trade network with many culturally diverse populations from the Plains area, the Caddoan area, and Cahokia by 1200 CE. In particular, Cahokia provided Dickson Mounds with luxury items such as copper ornaments and marine shell necklaces in exchange for food items such as meat and fish. The trade of foodstuffs for luxury goods required individuals at Dickson Mounds to generate a surplus of food, resulting in an intensification of agricultural production, which bore serious health and social consequences. Decline The population at Dickson Mounds is said to have inexplicably vanished during the late thirteenth to mid fourteenth century. Possible reasons for the decline of Dickson Mounds are warfare, climate change, and widespread epidemics. Climate change may have had detrimental effects on agriculture, particularly the cultivation of maize, on which the population had become so dependent for subsistence and trade. The significant expansions of the population as well as trade increased contact and transfer of infectious diseases and could also be possible causes of decline.

It was published in 2002 and is the sequel to The Magicians' Guild (2001) and is followed by The High Lord (2003). The book continues the story of a young girl named Sonea as she discovers and learns to control her magical powers; in The Novice, she has agreed to study at the Magicians' Guild under the protection of her new guardian Lord Rothen, and swears to Lord Rothen and another magician, Administrator Lorlen, to keep secret that the High Lord, Akkarin, is using forbidden black magic. Plot summary Sonea, formerly a slum girl--or \\"dwell\\"--begins her studies as a novice at the Magicians' Guild as part of the summer intake. Sonea does not have life easy, particularly with her rival and fellow pupil, Regin, who does his best to make Sonea's life at the Guild a living hell. She tries to ignore him at first but it only gets worse as Regin begins to circulate rumours about Rothen (her mentor) and her having a relationship. Though they truthfully deny this, Lorlen is forced to move Sonea to the Novice's Quarters to quell the rumours. Sonea, unable to take the bullying, studies hard and is promoted to the winter intake. The studies are harder and the students more mature, so the bullying does not continue in her new class. However, nor do the children befriend her, except for a slow-learner named Porril. Later, Regin is also promoted to Sonea's class, and with his old classmates from the summer intake continues to bully her. He frames her by putting one of her classmate's gold pens in her box, and she is accused of stealing. However, she can not prove her innocence since if she were 'truth-read' (her mind read by another magician), then the truth would come out about Akkarin's (the High Lord's)use of black magic, putting herself and those she cares about in danger. Meanwhile, Administrator Lorlen hopes to discover some way to counter Akkarin's powers in black magic (considered evil and forbidden in the guild), by studying the High Lord's past travels across the Allied Lands. Lorlen sends Lord Dannyl (now Second Ambassador to Elyne) to seek out information about the ancient magic which he may have studied. Dannyl is assisted by Tayend, a librarian from Elyne, who was also Akkarin's past helper. Tayend at first is terrified of magic, but it later turns out this is because he is afraid his homosexuality will be revealed. This is frowned upon in Elyne. Dannyl finds out Tayend's secret late in the story when healing him, and though surprised at first, eventually admits he too is homosexual, and the two begin a relationship. Lord Rothen's son, Dorrien, is a healer working in the countryside near Sachaka. He visits his father and befriends Sonea. He learns of the bullying and later sets a trap to catch Regin trying to frame Sonea by putting something from the library into her box. Dorrien teaches Sonea levitation, and the two gradually begin to become attracted to each other. On the day he leaves, Dorrien kisses Sonea for the first time. The High Lord, becoming suspicious about what he knows, eventually force-reads Administrator Lorlen's mind and discovers that Sonea, Rothen, and Lorlen are all aware of his use of black magic. He gives Lorlen a ring that enables the High Lord to hear and see everything Lorlen does as well as privately mind-speak to him. Akkarin decides to claim guardianship over Sonea to ensure that as long as she remains \\"hostage\\", Rothen and Lorlen cannot reveal anything that will jeopardize Sonea's safety whilst she will also stay quiet in order to protect them. In the city, a number of murders have plagued the slums: deaths that have the hallmarks of black magic. Administrator Lorlen is kept abreast of the murders by a family friend in the city's guard and suspects the High Lord's involvement, as does Sonea. Akkarin learns that Sonea's weakest subject is Warrior Skill and Lord Yikmo is made to be her teacher. Later, Yikmo discovers that Sonea is cautious with her powers since she is both against violence and aware that her powers are stronger, by how much she does not know, than the other students, and does not want to hurt them, even if they continue to harass her. Despite Sonea's position as the High Lord's favourite, Regin's harassment of her only intensifies. He and other novices begin ambushing her in the halls and torturing her with magic. Sonea shields herself from these attacks but always ends up unable to hold them off indefinitely. However, her power continues to grow as she fends off stronger and stronger attacks from larger numbers of pupils. Eventually, Yikmo and Lorlen find her being attacked, and, though she begs them not to tell Akkarin, they feel they must. However, it becomes clear that The High Lord is already aware of this and has done nothing to stop Regin's bullying, since he has noticed how much it is increasing her power. Dorrien comes back for another visit and Lorlen tells Rothen to discourage him from having a relationship with Sonea. Sonea, fearing for Dorrien's safety, decides to put an end to any relationship there may have been. At Lord Dorrien's suggestion, Sonea challenges Regin to a formal duel in the Arena. She works hard to train for the battle, which through skill (rather than brute strength) she wins 3 to 2, and her healing of the unconscious Regin after the battle only reinforces her newly-won respect from her peers and teachers. The Higher Magicians are shocked however at the extent of power Sonea has displayed. At the end of the story, Sonea witnesses the High Lord kill a man from Sachaka. The High Lord Akkarin explains the man was an assassin sent to kill him, but Sonea is not sure what to believe.

He was an author of plays and novels that are generally about African village life, customs, beliefs, and religious practices prior to contact with the Western world. Amadi is best regarded for his 1966 debut novel, The Concubine, which has been called \\"an outstanding work of pure fiction\\".Eldred Jones, \\"African Literature 1966-1967\\", African Forum, vol. 3, no. 1, p. 5.  Early life and education  Born in 1934, in Aluu in the Ikwerre local government area of Rivers State, Nigeria, Elechi Amadi attended Government College, Umuahia (1948‚Äì52), Survey School, Oyo (1953‚Äì54), and the University of Ibadan (1955‚Äì59), where he obtained a degree in Physics and Mathematics.  Career  He worked for a time as a land surveyor and later was a teacher at several schools, including the Nigerian Military School, Zaria (1963‚Äì66).Hans M.

Reviewing it, Lindsay Barrett wrote: \\"When an author has attained the status of an icon in his profession, based on the publication of works that have been declared iconic masterpieces from the earliest period of his career, it is unusual to find him engaging in experimentation in the latter stages of that career. This is the surprising trajectory that this short but profoundly memorable booklet by the late Elechi Amadi represents. Although the two narrative treatises contained in this work were described by the author as an excursion into the medium of science fiction it would really be more accurate to define them as philosophical allegories. Their contents contemplate the human condition and the limits of the potential for human achievement based on the concept of the supernatural rather than simply being exercises in the conceptualisation of events of an otherworldly nature, which popular science fiction often is. ... In the final analysis these works read like fables from the future that the author must have had immense enjoyment creating. Amadi‚Äôs love for literature and his prolific output in his early years overshadowed his scientific background especially after the Civil War when he settled down to work as an educationist and public administrator in Rivers State. It was in this period that he embarked on the experiments in new forms of writing of which this work is a slight but unforgettable example.\\"Lindsay Barrett, \\"Fables From The Future: Elechi Amadi‚Äôs Philosophical Allegories\\", The Independent (Nigeria), 21 August 2016.

Published in 2001, it is followed by The Novice (2002) and The High Lord (2003). The book tells the story of Sonea, a young girl from the slums, as she discovers her magical potential. When she hurls a stone through a magical barrier, accidentally injuring a magician behind it, Sonea finds herself on the run from the powerful Magicians' Guild. The magicians must find her before her uncontrolled and untrained powers kill her and destroy the city, as well as overcome Sonea's distrust and fear of the magicians and their Guild as they try to convince her to join their ranks. Plot Each winter in Imardin, the capital city of Kyralia, the streets are purged of the \\"dwells\\", the city's poor under-class, by magicians who drive away the inhabitants of the city's slums. Although young gang members gather to throw rocks at them, the magicians are protected by a magical shield‚Äîuntil Sonea, a young dwell, hurls a rock through their barrier and injures the magician Lord Fergun. Fearing a rogue magician, the Guild begins searching for Sonea. Lords Dannyl and Rothen lead the search into the slums, worried that Sonea's increasingly uncontrolled magic will harm her and those around her. But Sonea both distrusts the Guild for their apparent lack of compassion for the poor dwells and fears their reprisal for her accidental injury of Lord Fergun. She flees with her friend Cery, eventually seeking the aid of the shady Thieves, who see the value of having their own magician and take her under their care. With Cery, she sneaks into the Magician's Guild in an attempt to gain knowledge of how to control her magic, and observes a black-robed magician covered in blood performing a strange rite on a servant. However, her attempt to learn more is unsuccessful, and Sonea continues to lose control of her powers, setting fire to her surroundings repeatedly, before Lord Rothen at last locates her. At the magician's Guild, Lord Rothen and the sinister Fergun fight for Sonea's mentorship, though she is uninterested in training and only wants to return home to her friends and family. Lord Fergun attempts to sway Sonea to betray the Guild and thus prove that dwells are not fit to enter the Guild and goes so far as to kidnap and threaten Cery, but Fergun's plans are discovered and he is made to stand trial. In order to prove Fergun's guilt, Sonea submits to a mental examination, or 'truthreading', by Administrator Lorlen, who, finding the memory of the black-robed magician, reveals the man to be Lord Akkarin, head of the guild, explaining that she saw him practising black magic which is forbidden in Kyralia. Sonea decides then to join the Guild and train her magical potential.

This is the Pacific War companion game to Advanced Third Reich (A3R), using similar rules, and containing once again a copy of \\"Ultra\\" magazine with a synopsis of the game. A previous version, occasionally discussed in the pages of The General magazine, had been in development the late 1970s, but was never published.  Pacific Map  The map (designed by Charlie Kibler) is made up of two 31\\" √ó 22\\" sheets with 1\\" hexes and depicts the whole of the Pacific Ocean including parts of Australia, India, China, Russia & Japan. As in Europe the United States is represented by an off-map U.S. Box, although the Aleutian Islands (Alaska) and the Hawaiian Islands are shown on the map. The map is on a larger scale than the European war, so air units have range of 3 not 4, armour Zones of Control cost only one extra movement point (not 2) to move through and do not extend into rough terrain, while exploiting armour must keep to a chain of adjacent hexes, rather than one hex apart. The capture of hexes through attrition is much less likely. Eastern India and the northern parts of Australia (including Darwin and Cairns) are shown on the map. A (black-and-white) extension map for the whole of Australia was published in \\"Ultra\\" magazine in the late 1990s. The game includes rules for a successful Japanese player to force the surrender of India or Australia by transferring units into the relevant off-map box and conducting attrition combat. Strategic Redeployment of forces from one theatre to another (it takes a turn to move from one off-map box - the European US box, the Pacific US box, South Africa, Western India, Southern Australia, SouthWest Pacific - to another) can take several seasons. Much of the eastern map is taken up by ocean, dotted with island groups - a player need not occupy every single island to control the group, provided no enemy units are present. Units can stay unsupplied in a port or on a 1-hex island without being eliminated. The summer turn is the monsoon, in which attack or movement into rough terrain is forbidden. In normal weather Allied units (apart from Chindits or stealthy Australians) must stop in rough or jungle terrain, but Japanese can move freely through. However, after the Japanese seizure of Malaya and Burma in Winter 1941, land movement will probably play little role in the game, until the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in the final turns; the land war in China is usually an ongoing attrition and stalemate.  Naval Warfare   Aircraft Carriers & Naval Aviators  The naval war will take up most of players' time during the game, the explicit idea being that a major Pacific naval battle will take as long to resolve as an armour offensive on the Eastern Front. Players still have generic naval factors as in the European game, but also have separate named aircraft carriers, normally of two (CVL) or three (CV) factors. The former are much easier to sink, and take a year to rebuild (CVs take two years). The US also has some optional four factor carriers (CVB) which did not see service in the actual war. Each carrier factor can base a single Naval Air Squadron (NAS) - one third of the size of an Army Air Factor, but equal for combat strength if fighting \\"over water\\" (although, because of the size differential, three losses would need to be inflicted to destroy a single AAF). Naval Air Squadrons may also base at cities, and one squadron and/or 9 naval factors may base on a one-hex island. Japanese naval air squadrons start the game as \\"elite\\", using distinctive black-on-yellow counters and with a +1 Die Roll Modifier for combat. When eliminated, these are replaced with normal air squadrons, but the intense training required by naval aviators means Japan is limited to rebuilding 3 squadrons per turn. Whereas the American Air Training limit increases over time, a major battle (like Midway in reality) can cost Japan more naval air squadrons than she can replace in a year, and by 1944 Japan may well find herself with empty aircraft carriers as was the case at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. When the Americans draw close enough to the Home Islands, Japan may resort to building nine kamikaze air squadrons per turn. Kamikazes, for which the elite black-on-yellow counters are once again used, perform poorly in combat (-2 Die Roll Modifier) but their suicide attacks hit Allied ships at double strength.  Taskforces & Patrols  Naval forces may now be sent out as taskforces, which may not be examined by the other side. A taskforce may \\"Patrol\\" by \\"changing base\\" to a sea hex, where it remains throughout the enemy player turn. A patrol may attack any enemy land-based air in range (rolling for surprise as appropriate), after which enemy naval interception of the patrol, if attempted, is automatic. The following player turn the patrol (or a successful intercepting force, which may itself remain on patrol in the sea hex) may intercept enemy naval moves or give ground support to an attack (carriers may never give Defensive Air Support to ground units). A patrol might, therefore, lurk near to the target hex of a seaborne invasion, ready to take out enemy land-based air and head off enemy naval forces. Like any naval force, a patrol may not be intercepted on its way home after its mission is completed.  Naval Combat  For naval combat a player may split his taskforce into \\"combat groups\\" of at least nine factors each. Before each combat round each player allocates his naval air squadrons to attack enemy land bases in range or the enemy fleet, while up to half his naval air squadrons may be CAP (combat air patrol - flying in defence of their own combat group). Each player then makes a search roll to see how many enemy combat groups are located (if not located they cannot be attacked that round). The search roll is affected by radar, and will be higher, the more friendly combat groups a player has and the more nearby airbases containing at least one friendly squadron (the number of squadrons in each base is irrelevant, so it is better to build a network of small forces), and the more enemy combat groups which are escorting a supply line, or carrying invasion troops (it therefore makes sense to group these \\"slow\\" elements in a single combat group - players also sometimes place a single 9-factor fleet as a decoy in the first combat group to make the fast carriers harder to locate and attack). Although some element of the fog of war is (obviously) lost naval battles are perfectly playable solitaire by making rational deployment choices for each side. Before located combat groups are attacked, that group's CAP (which have a +1 DRM) may engage as many attackers as they like (so 2 squadrons of CAP might pick off a single attacking squadron to improve their chances). AAF based nearby may also give air cover. As in the European game the combat group then makes a defence roll (surviving CAP added to the defence strength), after which any surviving non-aborted attacking air may now attack the enemy combat group. Naval Air Squadrons - but not army air factors - may target individual fast carriers, which may themselves make a separate defence roll prior to being attacked. It will be recalled that a fast carrier has 2 or 3 factors - if each factor is \\"destroyed\\" or damaged twice by the attack, the ship as a whole is deemed \\"sunk\\", while if each factor is either \\"destroyed\\" or damaged once, the ship as a whole is deemed to be \\"damaged\\" and must leave the combat (attacking NAS must return to the aircraft carrier from which they took off, or be lost if she has been sunk, although those flying CAP may land at any carrier or friendly land base (at the cost of inverting)). Any other result (i.e. at least one carrier factor remaining in pristine condition) is deemed to be repaired at sea and the carrier begins the next round of combat with all factors once again intact. The difference between the two players' search rolls is the \\"surprise\\" result enjoyed by the player with the higher search result for that round of combat. High levels of surprise can be catastrophic, with CAP or defence rolls delayed until after the air attack or disallowed altogether, or all damage being lethal - this is what makes a disaster like the Battle of Midway possible. A second round of air attacks may now ensue, starting with a fresh search roll. After two rounds of air attack, naval surface combat may commence, with each side adding in a new combat group with each round (once engaged in surface combat, a combat group need no longer be \\"searched\\" for!). Surface combat is actually and perhaps unrealistically rare, and not the way to sink fast carriers as they are deemed to be \\"screened\\" by any ordinary naval factors in their combat group. There are some hard-to- remember rule anomalies - army air factors (if they survive counterair) are added to the defence strength of a naval base, but this is not true if they are giving air cover to a naval force - the opposite is true of naval air squadrons flying CAP. Some of these intricate rules were streamlined somewhat in A World At War.  Escort Carriers & Other Units  US Escort carriers (CVE) - generic factors, which do not carry separate naval air squadrons - also appear in the game. They are too slow to take part in naval interceptions, but can be used to provide ground support for attacks (carrier- based air may not intercept enemy Defensive Air Support), or take part in anti-submarine warfare. Japan may build Island Fortresses (1 per turn), which receive an extra +1 DM if subjected to invasion. The US player receives six single-factor US Marine Divisions, added gradually to the US forcepool throughout the game, which give a countervailing DM benefit in seaborne invasions, but which must be used to take any losses resulting from such combat. The US player also receives Artificial Harbours to increase his naval basing capacity in 1944 and 1945.  Strategic Warfare  Strategic Warfare may feature destruction of BRPs by submarines of both sides. Japanese submarines - which have an initial advantage from their \\"Long Lance\\" torpedoes - determine their effectiveness by tracing distance to the eastern map edge from the most easterly Japanese naval base. American submarines grow in power throughout the game, their effectiveness being determined by tracing distance to Japan's oil supply route (from the Dutch East Indies to Japan) from the nearest US naval base. BRP losses from US submarines will be massive by 1944 but are limited to 1/4 of the value of Japan's overseas conquests each turn, but once they pass 15 BRPs per turn Japan begins to suffer from incremental \\"oil effects\\", gradually degrading her economy, submarines and surface fleet. Japan is deemed to be subject to \\"oil effects\\" in Winter 1941 from the US embargo, but these will probably be lifted once Japan achieves control of the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia). Submarines may also operate on the map, and may attack damaged surface ships as they leave combat. Each side may also send surface factors to sea as raiders. The USA may also raid the Japanese oil route, which may also be bombed by Army Air Factors. The USA may also build strategic bombers. These are more effective than in Europe, as Japanese cities were built from wood, but will not be usable until the final turns of the game - although permissible bombing range increases throughout the game, in practice the USA needs to occupy the Marianas and then Okinawa, or bomb Japan from China if a sea supply route can be traced. In the final turns US strategic bombers may drop two Atomic Bombs, which besides exterminating any Japanese units in the target hex also increase the chances of Japanese surrender (see below). Each turn the US player receives between 0 and 4 \\"Magic\\" points, representing breaking of Japanese codes, and which may be used to affect naval & submarine effectiveness, or which can be used to Strategically Redeploy a 9-factor fleet.  Game Play   Combatants  The game is essentially for two players - the USA and Japan. Britain (including Australia and India, now treated as British Minor Allies, although Australian units can be lent to the USA) has some forces in the Far East, including a few CVLs normally based in India or Ceylon (other CVLs which were based in Europe are also included, for use if the game is combined with Advanced Third Reich). The Dutch, Filipinos and Thais (Japanese Associated Minor) have tiny forces. Counters are also included for pro-Japanese Indian and Chinese separatists, who may enter through play of variants. China and the USSR also play a role, but there is no diplomacy per se during the Pacific War. Nationalist China (white counters), the weakest of the great powers, has a theoretical base of 40 BRPs - 20 in practice (allowing a minuscule 10 BRP per turn spending limit) as four out of her five Key Economic Areas (Shanghai, Peking, Canton, Nanking, but not Chiang Kai-Shek's capital at Chungking) are already occupied by Japan prior to the start of the US-Japanese War. This makes China dependent on US BRP grants to rebuild her forces, which given the Japanese occupation of the land supply route through Vietnam and Burma, means that small numbers of BRPs must be flown \\"over the Hump\\" (over the Himalayas from Ledo to Kunming - the Allied player normally needs to base some US air factors in India to achieve this - two air factors are needed to carry each BRP). Claire Chennault's Flying Tigers (orange counters) give China her own tiny (two factor) air force. Communist China (red counters), a minor power, has small forces present. A Chinese Resistance Table reduces the freedom of action of Chinese forces and the degree of cooperation between the two Chinese factions if China is in serious trouble.  Course of the Game  The game starts with a Japanese double-turn across Winter 1941 and Spring 1942. Japan may use this to attack Pearl Harbor, with the location of the six US fast carriers (in Pearl Harbor, out on patrol, or in the US Box) decided by die roll; Japan may also make a second air strike but without the devastating surprise of the first. Japan may also seize Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore (whose fortifications do not protect against landward attack from Malaya), Burma, the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines. During the opening turn Japanese land units may invade undefended beaches and walk inland on the same turn, while Allied ground units are subject to a -1 DM (except the US Marines on Wake Island) and Allied air units are inverted. During 1942 the forces will be roughly equal, with six or so aircraft carriers on each side - this was the period which in reality saw tense fighting for Midway, the Coral Sea and Guadalcanal. As in Advanced Third Reich the US economic base (counted separately from the \\"European War\\" US economy) starts at 150 BRPs, but grows automatically by 20 BRP per turn after entering the war, so by 1944-5 the US economy will have grown to colossal size. American SR and initial deployment capacity are linked to the size of her base, while her forcepool increases in tranches, so by 1944-5 the USA will have achieved overwhelming strength in submarines, surface fleet and air factors. After the end of the war in Europe, the Soviets may invade Manchuria, which Japan has been required to garrison up until this point. Japanese surrender is governed by a table, similar to the British and Soviet surrender tables in Advanced Third Reich, in which Japan is assessed each turn for loss of oil, destruction of her armed forces (a rules anomaly allows the Japanese air force to escape destruction by sheltering in the Strategic Warfare Box), loss of objectives and atomic attacks. Japan is unlikely to \\"win\\" in real terms so game victory is determined by how quickly the Allies achieve Japanese surrender (whether or not requiring atomic attacks or invasion of the home islands) compared to the actual historical timeline.  Scenarios  Besides the introductory scenarios (for Pearl Harbor, and the battles of the Coral Sea, Midway, Leyte Gulf) the game also includes full- map scenarios starting in 1942 and 1944. The game also provides experimental rules for combining with Advanced Third Reich to simulate the whole global conflict. If there is no separate Chinese player Nationalist China, at war with Japan from the start, would be controlled by the US player, and Communist China by the Soviet player. The Designer's Notes state that ERS, shorter and less strategically complex than A3R, fits into the global war in the same proportion that the Eastern Front fits into the European War. A US-Japanese tensions table, similar to the US-Axis Tensions table, governs relations between those two powers until they go to war with one another. Japan may seize various territories (e.g. French Indo-China‚Äîmodern Vietnam‚Äîafter the Fall of France in 1940, leaving Burma as the only Allied land supply route for BRPs to China), while the USA may deploy her fleet‚Äîpossibly placed on alert‚Äîto Pearl Harbor and subject Japan to an oil embargo prior to the outbreak of hostilities. Another feature of these rules is the replacement of variants (of which a basic Pacific set is included for old-fashioned players) with rudimentary rules allowing players to \\"research\\" changes in, say, bomber, jet fighter, rocket, submarine or torpedo technology, and thus shape the development of her armed forces over the course of the game. These rules were greatly expanded in A World at War. Reception Empire of the Rising Sun won the Origins Award for Best Modern-Day Board Game of 1995.

Published in 2003, it is the sequel to The Novice and The Magicians' Guild and concludes the story of Sonea, a former slum-girl discovered to possess magical potential. Having earned the respect of her fellow students and her teachers, Sonea must face the terrible secret of the High Lord's use of forbidden Black Magic. Plot summary A year has passed since Sonea had challenged Regin to a public duel and had beaten Regin by one bout. Since that victory, she has finally won the respect she deserves, not only as a novice with exceptional power, but also as the High Lord's favorite. But even with this new respect, she still has one challenge left to face: Akkarin. Still unable to shake off the memory she has after the duel, she continues to avoid Akkarin. Ceryni, Sonea's old friend, now has a powerful position with the Thieves. He has a task which he must perform which could cost him his life. But that task is not a secret. A strange woman, named Savara, with great skill knows of this task and wishes to help Cery, however he will not accept her aid as he does not trust her. Akkarin surprises Sonea by showing her a book, which is an autobiography of Coren, a famous architect. This book reveals that Coren himself had discovered and no doubt used black magic. Sonea is amazed at this knowledge but is suspicious why he has shown this information to her. Akkarin is pleased that Sonea has read the book and gives her another one which is nearly 500 years old. From reading it, Sonea discovers that many centuries ago black magic was referred to as 'higher magic.' The book tells of a novice who desired power and used the higher magic to obtain more power by killing many magicians and absorbing their power. The Guild, in the end, suffered greatly from confronting the novice. They decided to store the knowledge of higher magic and rename it black magic. They sealed the knowledge, hoping that no one would take advantage of that power, but only use it in the greatest need and the knowledge was hidden in a secret passage of the University. The author also tells of a threat from Sachaka, that the Sachakans will have vengeance for losing an ancient war. Only the Head of Warriors knew of this secret weapon, however the knowledge was later lost. As Sonea starts to absorb this new information, Akkarin takes her into the city in disguise. Sonea realises that the Thieves are in on a secret with Akkarin as they use their 'private road.' Sonea and Akkarin come to a room face to face with a captured Sachakan slave who was sent to see how weak the Guild was. Akkarin starts to search the man, and finds a gold tooth with a red gem inside it; the gem is a blood gem, used by their masters to see and hear what the holder sees, hears and does. Akkarin then tells Sonea that he will teach her to read a mind of an unwilling person. Struggling at first, Sonea discovers the name of the Sachakan. She also discovers that Akkarin was a slave. Amazed and shocked, Sonea starts seeing memories of a group called the Ichani, powerful magicians that have been labeled as outcasts by the Sachakan King. Sonea is then taken outside while Akkarin stays inside and kills the man using black magic. Back at the Guild, Sonea starts to question everything she knows and has been told. She misses a class, instead finding solitude at a stream in the forest, a secret place that Dorrien had shown her. To her surprise, she is met by Akkarin as it was also where Akkarin and Lorlen used to go when they were young. Akkarin begins telling Sonea about his past, about how he entered Sachaka and was captured by an Ichani named Dakova who easily overpowered Akkarin. Whilst in servitude, Akkarin and his fellow slaves, all latent magicians, constantly had their power absorbed by Dakova. For five years, Akkarin was a magical source of energy for Dakova, but everything changed when Dakova was attacked by a fellow Ichani. Though Dakova won, he was left weak. He borrowed slaves from his brother Kariko. After some time Dakova found a previous enemy of his and decides to kill him. Upon arriving at an abandoned mine, the floor gives way and Akkarin falls down, only to be saved by another Ichani. The Ichani made a deal with Akkarin to spare his life if he killed Dakova, Akkarin agrees and is taught black magic by the Ichani. Akkarin headed back with wine laced with a sleeping drug. While Dakova drank the wine, Akkarin then killed the slaves, but when he came to Takan he could not take his dormant power because they had helped each other at times of need. When he came to Dakova, he took his power as quickly as possible, killing him in the process. With the deed done and now free, Akkarin then started his long journey home without food thinking he would die on the journey back to the guild but Takan followed him with a supply of food and drink and became Akkarin's servant. Sonea wondered why he had told her and asks him, his only answer is that someone else needs to know. As the gong strikes Akkarin ends the tale and tells Sonea to get back to her classes. Meanwhile Lord Dannyl has been instructed by Akkarin to infiltrate a group of Elyne nobles, led by a powerful Dem, attempting to illicitly learn magic. Having managed to enter the Dem's circle of trust by having them learn the \\"false secret\\" of his relation with Tayend, he begins teaching Farand, a young man whose powers have been unleashed but who has not learnt Control. Slowly, Dannyl gains more trust from the Dem. When Dannyl enters Farand's mind, he realises the Elyne King used Farand for eavesdropping. Farand had overheard the King order a political assassination, because of this Farand was prevented from joining the Guild by the King. Back at the Guild, Sonea is unable to sleep. She is continuously replaying what Akkarin had told her, and wondering why he told her. She even starts to believe that black magic isn't necessarily evil, only the wielder of the magic can determine that. She starts to wonder what would happen if Akkarin was to die and no one would be able to carry on the secret struggle with the Sachakan spies. She decides to tell Akkarin that she wants to learn black magic. The next day when Sonea tells Akkarin that she wants to learn, he refuses, he starts to change her mind saying that if she is caught, she will be executed. However her mind is made up, Akkarin refuses but says that he has another use for Sonea. He informs her that, if she was willing, she can be a source of power for him. He says he will only teach her black magic if the Ichani invade Kyralia. Even though she isn't helping in the way she thought she would, she is still pleased to assist Akkarin. Lord Dannyl visits Farand once more to assure everyone that he has learnt Control. When in Farand's mind, Dannyl starts questioning him. Before Dannyl can get any answers, Farand is aware of what Dannyl is doing and breaks the connection. Revealing him as a traitor, Farand tells everyone that more magicians are on their way, but don't know Dannyl's location. However Dannyl informs the group of rebels that that won't be the case. Farand perceives Dannyl's and the other magician's conversation and agrees with him. The other nobles are apprehended, Farand and the Dem surrender. At night, Sonea is worried about Akkarin, since he is not back for hunting the latest spy. (This is the first indication that, where she shortly before hated Akkarin and wanted him dead, now she starts to be positively concerned for him.) Once he returns, Sonea realises that the fight must have been terrible, and that Akkarin lost. She and Takan follow him to his bedroom and Akkarin starts filling in the details about the new spy. Akkarin believes that this new spy is another slave, but Takan tells Akkarin that she must be an Ichani, as she is cunning and strong. Takan once again tells Akkarin to teach Sonea black magic for help in case he dies, Akkarin finally agrees that he will teach Sonea tomorrow night. Cery is surprised that Akkarin lost to the latest spy, and vows to find her again. Savara enters Cery's room saying that if Cery had trusted her, she could have dealt with the new spy, unlike Akkarin. Savara then continues, saying that she knows the spy and wishes revenge for a past act. However she realises that now that Akkarin knows about the new spy, she cannot intervene without revealing herself, something she does not wish to do. Cery promises that she can hunt the next spy. The next day, while Lorlen and Lord Sarrin discuss building plans, Lord Osen informs them that there has been a massacre last night, a magician and his family have been murdered. All the victims had shallow cuts, which weren't fatal wounds. Osen also reports that there was a major battle between some unknown magicians. Lorlen decides that someone should go to the location of the fight and see if it had been magical. At night, Sonea makes her way to the underground passage to start her training in black magic. Akkarin informs Sonea that all living things have a natural barrier. With black magic, the idea is to break the barrier and draw their magical power from them. Sonea, under Akkarin's instructions, starts to learn how to take power, with Takan as her source. Once she is done, she heals him and is given some more books on black magic to read. While heading back to Imardin, Dannyl and Farand start talking about the future, and what consequences he and the other rebels would have to face. Realising that he is tired, Dannyl tells Farand to get some sleep, as he starts to leave Dannyl notices that Farand's lips are blue and comes to the conclusion that he has been poisoned. Dannyl then calls on Lady Vinara using telepathy, she informs him of how to purge the poison. Dannyl barricades the door to prevent anyone stopping him from healing Farand. Akkarin takes Sonea to show her how to defeat the spies, the Thieves inform them of where she is but when they reach her rooms she is not there. They look around, hearing footsteps Sonea hides in an alcove. The spy enters and talks to Akkarin before they start attacking one another. The spy moves closer to the alcove and Sonea tries to stay hidden, the combat is causing damage to be building and Sonea is forced to use her shield. She finds a ring in the alcove, one worn by an elder of a noble house. A heavy blow is struck and the alcove collapses, however Sonea creates a hollow with her shield, she then realises the spy is not a slave but a powerful Ichani. A hole is formed as the hollow begins to collapse, Sonea then sees that the Ichani is moving backwards and will soon detect her. Sonea drops her shield and the Ichani's passes over her undetected, she then slashes the Ichani's neck with a piece of wood and drains her power, killing the woman. Akkarin and Sonea then return to the Guild. The Magicians Guild have learned that Akkarin and Sonea are using black magic and believe they may be responsible for the murders. They are tried and convicted of using forbidden magic, but not of the murders. Akkarin is sentenced to exile in Sachaka, Sonea is allowed to remain but refuses saying that, if alone, Akkarin will be killed. Unsure about Akkarin's explanation of an imminent Ichani invasion they are both exiled. Akkarin and Sonea are forced to hide in the wastes of Sachaka where they are pursued by a pair of Ichani but manage to elude them. Meanwhile the Ichani invade Kyralia, easily overcoming the (reinforced) border defenses and slaughtering over twenty Guild magicians. They then advance on the capital Imardin, but are slowed by an ambush. It seems that only Akkarin and Sonea will be able to hold back the Ichani invasion as the Guild magicians are no match for them. Whilst in Sachaka, Sonea develops feelings for Akkarin, but tries to hide them. However Sonea awakes Akkarin from a nightmare and accidentally senses his feelings for her - seeing herself through his eyes, she sees a far more beautiful and alluring woman than she ever saw when looking in the mirror. Akkarin is hesitant because he argues he is 13 years older than Sonea, but Sonea doesn't seem to care. They kiss, and later sleep together. As eventually comes out, Akkarin's recurring nightmare was about a woman fellow slave, with whom he had been in love during his captivity in Sachaka, and whose death he witnessed and was unable to prevent. Finding a new love with Sonea lays this ghost, and Akkarin ceases to have such nightmares. The two then return to the borders of Kyralia where they encounter Dorrien, who isn't too happy to see them there, he escorts them back to the border but they are ambushed by one of the Ichani (called Parika), who is eventually killed by Sonea using Healing Magic, and Akkarin drains his energy. The Ichani have no knowledge of Healing Magic, and are surprised when Sonea heals a cut in front of them. The three return to Dorrien's small home and discuss possible plans, they seem to decide one. Whereby Sonea and Akkarin will secretly return to Imardin, their city. Akkarin and Sonea return to Imardin and enlist the aid of the Thieves, including Cery, Sonea's old friend and slum dwellers in fighting the Ichani who now roam the city searching for victims to strengthen them. Sonea and Akkarin search the slum dwells for any magical potential and take it to strengthen their power, however, unlike the Ichani, they do not kill their helpers. The night before, Cery gives Akkarin and Sonea some changes of clothes, including full length, black, magician robes. Sonea and Akkarin are able to pick off many of the Ichani one by one, while another is killed with the help of Regin, Sonea's old Novice enemy. One Ichani is then killed by the Thieves and another by the Guild. Eventually only three Ichani remain. But Lorlen is badly wounded, and tells Akkarin that he understands why he did what he did, he asks if Sonea is ok, and then he dies and Akkarin takes his ring. Unfortunately, the three Ichani left have been absorbing the magic from various magically constructed buildings, and increasing in strength. Before the remaining Ichani can absorb the magic held in the Guild buildings (including the Arena, which has masses of power around it), Akkarin and Sonea force the three into a final battle at the Guild. A climactic battle ensues and the Ichani begin to tire. However, the lead Ichani, Kariko, lays a trap and a knife springs out of the ground and stabs Akkarin through the chest. As Akkarin is unable to fight, he persuades Sonea to make use of and channel his energy to supplement her dwindling reserves and with that combination of force, Sonea manages to destroy the last three Ichani. However, in doing so, all of Akkarin's life force is absorbed by Sonea, and he dies. 'He had given her too much power. He had given her everything.' Sonea deeply grieves for him and becomes extremely depressed, locking herself in her old room at Rothen's lodgings and losing the will to live - totally exhausted, physically and emotionally, and though never having been formally married to him, feels herself very much as Akkarin's widow. Whilst Dannyl and Tayend, his assistant and lover, return to Elyne, the Higher Magicians debate about whom to appoint to various positions in the Guild and appoint Rothen as the Head of Alchemic Studies. Lord Osen will probably replace the late Lord Lorlen. Lord Balkan is expected to replace Akkarin. The Higher Magicians are reconciled to the need to have a recognised Black Magician, since otherwise the Guild and the country would be completely helpless before further invasions - and Sonea is the only possible candidate, since it seems the books left behind by Akkarin do not provide enough information on how to do it. At first they intend to impose on her the condition of not being allowed to leave the Guild premises. However, arguing against that restriction, Rothen explains to them that she joined the guild in order to help the poor, and they reconsider. They rule that if she is to venture out beyond the guild premises, she must be accompanied by an escort, and she must not venture beyond the city slums in which she seeks to aid the poor. In a matter of months the Guild builds a hospital for the slums, a reversal of the long-standing discriminatory policy whereby the Healing magic was only available to the Aristocratic Houses. Though Sonea has done only three years of training out of the five required of a novice, it is obviously out of the question to treat her as anything but a full-fledged magician; instead, Dorrien (who is still in love with her) and Lady Vinara volunteer, and are formally assigned, to complete Sonea's training as a Healer. She is also to wear black robes from then on, and the High Lord is to wear white. In the final scene, Sonea spots her Aunt in the queue at the slum hospital with a baby in her arms and tells Rothen to call her over in the office. Her Aunt tells her what the problem is and Sonea gives her the prescriptions for the baby's fever. Sonea then hesitantly tries to explain to her Aunt that she would like her to come live in the guild with Sonea because she is in need of her help. At first, Sonea's aunt is confused, as is Rothen, but when Sonea taps her belly, Sonea's Aunt understands and they make explanations to Rothen. Sonea is fearful; she is carrying Akkarin's baby and didn't plan for it to happen. Sonea's Aunt smiles and soothingly assures her that she will indeed look after her, at least for a while, to help guide and prepare her for what is to come. As already disclosed by the writer, Sonea would give birth to a son named Lorkin, who is a major character in the sequel \\"The Ambassador's Mission\\". Characters ;Sonea: Former novice of Lord Rothen and High Lord Akkarin, first person to be admitted to the guild from the lower classes and first Guild Black Magician. Sonea, having learned of Akkarin's true nature and his reasons behind learning Black magic, sought to learn the art herself despite having to break the laws of the Guild to do so. She was banished to Sachaka along with Akkarin when the Guild learned of their practices, and having admitted to killing a woman - a murderer and Sachakan black magician. While in Sachaka the two fall in love and return to Imardin in secret, knowing that the Ichani are heading there also. She fights and kills Kariko, the leader of the Ichani, but doing so causes the death of Akkarin as well. Following that, Sonea loses the will to live. The Guild feel they need her to take the position as the Guild's official Black Magician, or elso to teach somebody elso to take the role. To encourage her, they build a hospital in the slums and allow her to continue her education in healing. Finally, it is revealed that she is pregnant with Akkarin's son. ;High Lord Akkarin: Beginning the novel as the main antagonist, Akkarin is Sonea's guardian. Sonea learned of the High Lords' use of Black Magic, so he took her guardianship from Lord Rothen, claiming that she would benefit more from his influence. He is suspected by both Lorlen and Sonea to have committed a series of murders in the city. However it is revealed that Akkarin is not in fact the murderer, but has been trying to prevent the murders for some time. He learned Black magic after being captured and enslaved by a Sachakan outcast (Ichani). He escaped, killing the Ichani, to return to Imardin where he was appointed as High Lord, despite his youth. When Akkarin - and Sonea's - use of Black magic is discovered, both out banished from the Allied Lands and sent to Sachaka. Akkarin and Sonea fall in love, and return to Imardin in secret, knowing that the Ichani are heading there also. When fighting Kariko, the leader of the Ichani, Akkarin gives all of his strength to Sonea and dies as a result. ;Lord Rothen: Sonea's former guardian. Rothen is the first third to learn of Akkarin's use of Black Magic.

It was named Enham until 1945 and previously Lower Kings Enham. There are three population areas, in order from north to south, now named Upper Enham (formerly Upper King's Enham), Enham Alamein (formerly Lower Enham and earlier Lower King's Enham) and Knight's Enham. At the 2011 Census the population of the civil parish was 804. Knight's Enham is now part of the north edge of suburban spread of Andover, about a kilometre south along the A343 road from the current site of Enham Alamein. This is a hamlet of 3 or 4 houses and a church with a first recorded date of 1241. The village of Enham was one of the original \\"Village Centres\\" chosen for the rehabilitation of injured and war-disabled soldiers returning from the front line of World War I. Originally funded by King George V in 1919, the Village Centre became a hub for the care of these soldiers where they were retrained in new trades such as basketry, upholstery, gardening services and other trades. This formed the basis of the charity which still exists today and owns the majority of Enham Alamein village, Enham Trust, providing care for civilians with disabilities. Etymology and history Enham Houses, Enham Alamein The spelling Anglo-Saxon \\"Eanham\\" is recorded from the year 1008, pointing to ƒìan-hƒÅm = \\"lamb homestead\\" or ƒìan-hamm = \\"enclosure, for the raising of lambs\\". There is a speculation that the \\"raising of lambs\\" refers to the rebirth of England under the one Christian God, as decreed in the Enham Codes written in the year 1008 at what later became Kings Enham (Upper and Lower), the royal estate of the 1008 lawcode and known as such in the later Middle Ages. Of particular interest is the meeting of the Witan including Bishop Wulfstan and King Aethelred II at Upper (Kings) Enham on 16 May 1008.Anglo Saxon England No.43 published by Cambridge University press 2007 ). This law-making council of 40 nobles and around 360 retainers, put into draft a decree detailing the social ordering of England and to bring England as a whole under one Christian God, One King, and giving all men the right to law.English historical documents c500 - 1042 pp.448 (Dorothy Whitelock) These laws were aimed at bringing the populace together against the Viking raiders and are referred to as \\"the Enham Codes\\"\\"Voices from reign of Aethelred II\\" by Janna Muller https://www.academia.edu/3536979/_Ealla_thas_ungesaelda_us_gelumpon_thuruh_unraedas_Voices_from_the_Reign_of_Aethelred_II_in_Von_Aethelred_zum_Mann_im_Mond_Forschungsarbeiten_aus_der_englischen_Mediavistik_ed._F._Reitemeier_und_J._Muller_Gottinger_Schriften_zur_Englischen_Philologie_4_Gottingen_2010_pp._13-120 According to Cambridge University, the meeting of the Witan was held at what later became Kings (Upper) Enham Anglo Saxon England no.43 published by Cambridge University Press, 2007 on the high ground along what is now MacCallum Road (previously Enham Lane) at Home Farm, (previously Kings Enham Farm). At Home Farm there are Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Roman, Anglo- Saxon and medieval deposits indicating consistent habitation, with at least one Roman villa confirmed as significant by Andover Museum, and a clear boundary ditch locally known as \\"the valley\\". Other deep earthworks can be remembered in living memory before they were filled in to make way for modern farm machinery.

In 1919, George Hughes Earle of the Cavalry Club in Piccadilly in London inherited a landed estate, and sold of it to the trustees of the Village Centres for Curative Treatment and Training Council (Incorporated). The centre was set up, using this land, with the support of King George V and his wife Queen Mary, and adapted to house and rehabilitate and employ soldiers returning disabled from World War I with \\"the effects of amputations, neurasthenia, shellshock or fever\\". By the end of 1919, 150 men were residing in and about Enham Place and Littlecote House. In 1921 the trust bought 8 more acres in 4 parcels at Knight's Enham. The trust received from the Board of Trade a licence to hold not more than 10,000 acres of land to carry out the trust's purpose. During the 1920s and 1930s, much of the land had to be sold to pay expenses; one sale of 1934 was for the Home Farm. Some of the home's patients remained there and set up in jobs such as carters, hauliers, market gardeners and dairy farmers. In World War II, many of the injured from the Battle of El Alamein were brought back to the UK and to the recovery centre in Lower Enham. This close association of servicemen and the village continued during and after the war. In November 1945, two public subscriptions in Egypt raised ¬£250,000 (worth around ¬£6 million as at AD 2010), to thank Britain for ridding their country of the Axis forces. A small part went to build a new UN Forces Sports Club in Gezira in Cairo; most was given to the charity Enham to care for disabled ex-servicemen. This greatly improved the charity Enham's finances, and let them build their disabled ex-servicemen's centre as it is. In thankfulness for this, the component \\"Alamein\\" was appended to the village's name.  Community  In Enham Alamein is The Enham Trust, a disability charity.

Like compulsory figures, special figures involved tracing patterns on the ice with the blade of one ice skate. This required the skater to display significant balance and control while skating on one foot. While compulsory figures were standard patterns derived from the figure 8, the special figures were elaborate patterns of the skaters' own invention. These designs included rosettes, stars, crosses, and other elaborate curlicues. The building blocks for special figures included not only the elements of the standard compulsory figures, but shapes known as beaks, spectacles, and cross-cuts. Tracing of elaborate patterns on the ice was a characteristic of the American and British schools of figure skating. By the early 20th century, this had been largely displaced by the \\"International Style\\" of free skating which utilized the entire ice surface and featured more athletic movements set to music. Special figures was an event in the 1908 Summer Olympic Games. Nikolai Panin of Russia won the event.

It may also be known as a cornhouse or corn house.Corn-house def. 2. Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed. Overview After the harvest and while still on the cob, corn is placed in the crib either with or without the husk. The typical corn crib has slats in its walls to allow air to circulate through the corn, both allowing it to dry initially and helping it stay dry. The slats expose the corn to pests, so corn cribs are elevated beyond the reach of rodents. Corn cribs were first used by Native Americans and were quickly adopted by European settlers. Struggling European settlers often raided corn cribs for food. As a result, at least some Native groups abandoned the corn crib and buried food in caches.Bruce E. Johansen, ed., The Encyclopedia of Native American Economic History. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1999. 125. Print. Corn crib designs vary greatly. They were originally made of wood, but other materials such as concrete have also been used. The basic corn crib consists of a roofed bin elevated on posts. Another typical early American design has walls slanted outward. Most of the larger designs have an open space in the middle for accessing corn and promoting airflow. In larger designs, this space was often used to store wagons. By the early 20th century, the term \\"corn crib\\" was applied to large barns that contained many individual bins of corn.Indiana Department of Natural Resources Today a typical corn crib on many farms is a cylindrical cage of galvanized wire fencing covered by a metal roof formed of corrugated galvanised iron.

It was one of the Police (Scotland) Acts 1857 to 1890.The Short Titles Act 1896, section 2(1) and Schedule 2 The legislation made the establishment of a police force mandatory in the counties of Scotland, and also allowed existing burgh police forces to be consolidated with a county force. Establishment of County Police Forces The Commissioners of Supply for each county were required to form a Police Committee to administer a police force for their area. The committee was to consist of not more than 15 commissioners, plus the Lord Lieutenant and Sheriff of the county (or their deputies). The police force forces were to come into existence on 15 March 1858. A Chief Constable was to be appointed to each police force by the committee. It was, however, permitted for two or more adjoining counties to appoint a single chief constable. The chief constable was to run the day-to-day activities of the force, and to appoint and dismiss constables. He was also to appoint a deputy chief constable to act in his absence. The commissioners of supply were to levy a \\"police assessment\\" or special rate to finance the constabulary. They were also permitted to divide a county into Police Districts, with constables allocated to each district, and a separate assessment to be paid in each area. Jurisdiction of County Constables Constables of a county police force were to have full powers within their county, which was to include for policing purposes any detached parts of other counties locally situate within it. Similar provisions were made in regard to sheriffs and justices of the peace. They had jurisdiction in all harbours, lochs and bays, and in burghs within the county, and in any adjoining county. Constables in Berwickshire, Dumfriesshire and Roxburghshire were permitted to serve warrants in the counties of Cumberland and Northumberland across the English border. Inspector of Constabulary An Inspector of Constabulary was to be appointed to ensure that an efficient police system was being operated by the various forces in Scotland. He was to certify annually that each force was being effectively, making it eligible to payment of one quarter of its costs by the treasury. According to the Inspector's first report in 1859, 32 counties and 57 burghs had established police forces. Burgh Police Forces A number of burghs had established police forces, either under the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act 1833 or by local Acts. The magistrates and town council of a burgh could agree with the commissioners of supply of a county to consolidate the burgh force with the county police. One or more members of the town council would be appointed to the county police committee in this case. Conversely, the Act allowed any burgh which had not yet established a police force to do so within six months of the passing of the Act. Burgh forces were also to be subject to inspection, but those unconsolidated burghs with a population of 5,000 or less were not permitted to avail of central government funds. Exceptions The Act did not automatically extend to Orkney and Shetland, although it could be applied by Order in Council on the request of the Sheriff of the county. The Act did not affect any police forces employed by railway or canal companies, or established by local act of parliament.

Biography Born into a poor family in Valencia, Pinazo was forced from a young age to assist in supporting the family by practising various trades. He had only attended eight grades when his mother died of the cholera, and young Ignazio was variously employed as a silversmith, a painter of tiles, and a decorator of fans. After his father's death, he lived with his grandparents, and in 1864 enrolled in the San Carlos Academy of Fine Arts, Valencia, earning his living as a hatter. His artistic career started when he was 21, and he achieved his first success in Barcelona three years later. In 1871, work by him was displayed in the National Exhibition of Fine Arts for the first time. In 1873 the sale of a painting provided sufficient funds for him to visit Rome for the first time. When he returned to his native city in 1874, he abandoned the conventional historic themes he had so far devoted his efforts to, and instead started painting family subjects, nude figures, and scenes from daily life, thereby anticipating Joaqu√≠n Sorolla y Bastida and Francisco Domingo both in subject and style. This is the beginning of a more intimate, Impressionist style. He returned to Rome in 1876, having obtained a grant from the Diputaci√≥n de Val√®ncia, this time staying for five years. In 1884, due to a cholera epidemic in Valencia, Pinazo temporarily moved to the town of B√©tera, where he stayed in the villa ‚ÄúMaria‚Äù of the banker Jose Jaumandreu. From 1884 to 1886 he taught at the School of Valencia. He received many commissions from the Valencian aristocracy, among them the Marchioness of Benicarl√≥. The annual art exhibitions brought Pinazo silver medals in 1881 and 1885, and gold medals in 1887 and 1899. He also received a royal medal and in 1912 a street in Valencia was named after him. He was married to Teresa Martinez Montfort. They had two sons, Ignacio and Jose, both of whom became painters themselves. He died in Godella, aged 67. Work Ignazio Pinazo worked with dark colours: black, brown and other earth-like shades, as well as in the scintillating palette typical of Impressionism. His work often shows rapid brush strokes. Paintings include: * Las hijas del Cid (1879) * Los √∫ltimos momentos del rey Don Jaime el Conquistador en el acto de entregar su espada a su hijo Don Pedro * El guardav√≠a (1877) * Barca en la playa (1890). Part of his work can be seen in the Basilica de la asunci√≥n in the town of Cieza, and in the Museu de Belles Arts de Val√®ncia (Valencia Museum of Fine Arts). The largest collection of this painter's work is held at the Institut Valenci√† d'Art Modern (Valencia Institute of Modern Art), with over one hundred paintings and six hundred drawings, although unfortunately these are not on permanent display. A selection of his work may also be viewed at the Museo del Prado in Madrid.

Jefferson House Jefferson House is a department of Hartford Hospital that has provided long-term care and rehabilitation services to seniors in the greater Hartford area for more than 120 years. Jefferson House is 104-bed long-term care facility, and serves approximately 92 residents. History The hospital was formed in 1854 after the State of Connecticut granted a charter for the Formation of Hartford Hospital following a boiler explosion and resulting fire at the Fales and Grey Car Works resulting in 19 deaths and 23 people seriously injured. Fundraising drive for Hartford Hospital in WWII Jefferson House history Originally located at 36 Jefferson Street in Hartford, the Old People's Home of Hartford offered the \\"elderly an alternative to the county poorhouse.\\" The Connecticut Legislature authorized the facility by a Special Act in 1873 and opened its doors in December 1, 1884. Public Documents of the State of Connecticut described the home: > PRIVATE PROVISION FOR THE AGED > THE OLD PEOPLE'S HOME HARTFORD > LA Sexton MD Superintendent The Old People's Home is under the same > management as the Hartford Hospital and was organized by an act of the > General Assembly in 1873.

The home cared for and honored its commitment under the old life-care concept until 1979 when the last original resident died. It cared for 662 patients from 1884 to 1979. A new facility was constructed and opened in Newington, Connecticut in 1980, as a short-term rehabilitation facility. Medical education Hartford Hospital has trained physicians for over 160 years, through its residency and fellowship programs. A number of training programs are offered to newly graduated physicians (MD and DO), each of which is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.

The Foundation's projects are articulated around its flagship: the sailing boat \\"Fleur de Passion\\" which will circumnavigate the world exploring its most important and threatened marine regions as identified by the WWF‚Äôs Global 200 project. This expedition named \\"The Changing Oceans Expedition\\"The Changing Oceans Expedition website is conducted in close co-operation with the IUCN.\\"What is the real state of our oceans?\\", IUCN http://cms.iucn.org/fr/congress_fr/nouvelles_congres/index.cfm?uNewsID=1836 In 2008 Antinea Foundation and its expedition received patronage of the UNESCO. To carry out its mission the Foundation is creating a partnership network of leading organisations in the scientific, conservation, eco-tourism and media fields. The organisation acts as a supporting and strengthening element, not only assembling skills and know-how but also contributing its resources to the particular mission of each of its partners and communicating the underlying conservation issues to a wider public. Objectives Antinea Foundation's mission to play an innovative role in protecting the oceans is carried out by focussing on three main objectives: #Scientific Research: Contributing to a better scientific understanding of the marine environment, in particular by providing scientists access to the organisation's expedition vessel \\"Fleur de Passion\\" #Communication & Education: Raising public awareness and media attention on marine conservation issues making use of cutting-edge communication tools #Participation: Giving members of the Foundation and further individuals the opportunity to become involved in projects as eco- volunteers History The history of the Antinea Foundation dates began in early 2000 with the creation of the Association Pacifique and the inauguration of the Association Antinea in 2005. Both organisation were based in Geneva, Switzerland. In 2002, the Association Pacifique bought \\"Fleur de Passion\\", an almost 60-year-old abandoned 32-meter sailing boat. This boat was used by its previous owner in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic in the framework of socio-educational, navigation, diving and scientific projects. Since 2001, the Association Pacifique worked assiduously to completely restore \\"Fleur de Passion\\", preparing it to sail once again soon. Meanwhile, the Association Antinea had as its objective to organise a global circumnavigation on board of a yacht which would serve as a platform for research and communication, in a quest to contribute to the protection of the marine environment. The sailing ship Antinea, a 17-meter sloop accomplished the first leg of the expedition, crossing the Atlantic from the Caribbean to Europe in 2005. The project quickly outgrew its humble beginnings with the realisation that the boat had become too small to fulfill Antinea's new ambitions. Realising that the objectives of the two organisations were complementary, the Associations Pacifique and Antinea decided, at the beginning of 2006, to unite their assets, resources and energy and create the Antinea Foundation effectively carrying out their projects together. In June 2007 the Antinea Foundation was officially established as a foundation under Swiss law. The Changing Oceans Expedition On October 8, 2008 at the World Conservation Congress in Barcelona the Antinea Foundation, in partnership with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), launched a worldwide expedition called \\"The Changing Oceans Expedition\\".Not to be confused with The Changing Oceans Expedition, Heriot Watt University's expedition performed with \\"Royal Research Ship James Cook.\\" The purpose of the initiative was to take stock of the current state of the oceans, study to what extent how they have changed especially in regard to human activity and explore what solutions are available to strengthen their health. During its voyage, Antinea's flagship Fleur de Passion would visit marine sites that are exceptional for the richness of their biodiversity. Included in those will be marine World Heritage Site and other globally significant marine protected areas. Small and large organisations will be given access to use the ship for research purposes.

The Flagship \\"Fleur de Passion\\" Fleur de PassionFondation Pacifique is the Foundation's flagship and project station. It is a sailing ship with a surprising past. Originally a motor boat of the German Navy, it was built in 1941 for war services, such as de-mining and resupplying submarines. For this reason, the boat has a mixed structure with a wooden hull and steel ribs. In 1945 it was surrendered to the French Navy in compensation for war damages. In 1976 it was disarmed and sold to an individual who transformed it into a ketch and named it Fleur de Passion. For the following 20 years it was used in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic for socio- educational and scientific activities. Fleur de Passion, which had been abandoned for years, was bought in 2002 by the Association Pacifique and put it in a dry dock in January 2003 to start its total restoration. After more than 5 years and 60‚Äô000 hour of work it was ready to set sail.

She was born in Trieste (now Italy, then Austro- Hungarian Empire) in 1905. Her early childhood was spent in Vienna and eventually moved to Zagreb, Croatia where she attended grammar school. She graduated with a degree in mathematics and physics from Zagreb University in 1928 and was immediately employed in the National and University Library in Zagreb. She worked in different departments of the Library as her career progressed. She reorganized the natural sciences section in the classified catalogue and also worked on the foreign periodicals collection. She also was in charge of choosing and purchasing works dealing with the natural sciences, technology, and librarianship. Verona remained at the University Library until retiring in 1967. Starting in 1968 she was a professor at the University of Zagreb for students of librarianship. She was also active in the library journal Vjesnik bibliotekara Hrvatske and in the Croatian Encyclopedia, for which she wrote numerous works about the history of Croatian libraries. Verona served as the journal's editor-in-chief from 1960-1965. She also took part in the Croatian Library Association. In the fifties, Verona's focus switched to the theory of alphabetical catalogues. She published multiple papers on this subject, and soon became the leading international expert. Her papers published in \\"Vjesnik bibliotekara Hrvatske\\", \\"Libri\\", and \\"Library Resources and Technical Services\\" examined her comparisons of different approaches practiced by individual foreign catalogues and cataloging codes in cataloging anonymous works and corporate headings. She also studied the history of these cataloging practices. Using her experience in cataloguing rules she wrote Cataloguing Code, published in 1970 and 1983. The IFLA Committee on Cataloguing noted Verona's contribution in 1954 at its meeting in Zagreb. She became known and accepted by the International library community and in 1961 played an important part in the International Conference on Cataloguing Principles in Paris. Verona served as both a member of the Consulting Committee of the International Committee of Bibliographic Control and as the chairperson of the IFLA's Section for cataloguing from 1974-1977. During this three-year period, she wrote a critical study on corporate headings, in which she compared the use of corporate headings in diverse catalogues and national biographies. Eva Verona will be remembered by generations of her students for her logic and consistent thought, exquisite politeness, and generosity in transmitting her ample knowledge. In addition to her many other accomplishments, she also was the first European librarian to receive the American Library Association's Margaret Mann Citation in 1976 and was the first person to be awarded a PhD in the librarianship by the University of Zagreb. Since 1998, the Croatian Library Association presents the Eva Verona Award for \\"outstanding dedication to work, innovative practice and promotion of library profession\\". Upon her death in 1996, library journals around the world published obituaries and celebrated the life of Croatia's most influential librarian.

Route 11 originally was planned to be a freeway/expressway, running northwest-to-southeast, from Colchester to Waterford. However, only about half of the freeway was constructed; one end is in Salem. As a result, many people in New London County, who would have benefitted most from the original project, derisively refer to the highway as Route 5¬Ω. https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/investigations/hidden-in-plain-sight- connecticut-roads-to-nowhere/124886/ The delays, and eventual effective cancellation of the project in 2009, were due to funding and environmental issues. However, more recently, there has been a push to complete the expressway. This would be done by installing tolls on Route 11 to make up for the expenses. Route description Route 11's southern terminus is the interchange with Route 82 (Exit 4) in the town of Salem. When completed, Route 11's southern terminus will be at an interchange with Interstate 95 and Interstate 395 in the town of East Lyme. It proceeds northward, soon crossing the Eightmile River. The road continues about crossing over Witch Meadow Road (Exit 5) at a diamond interchange, which leads to Salem center. Route 11 soon crosses into the town of Colchester, then has an interchange with Lake Hayward Road (Exit 6) about after crossing the town line. Lake Hayward Road, an unsigned state highway known as State Road 637, provides access to eastbound Route 2, Route 85, and Route 354\\\\. Northbound Route 11 merges onto westbound Route 2 0.6 miles later. History Aerial view of the split between Route 11 (bottom left) and Route 2 An expressway connecting Route 2 in Colchester and the Connecticut Turnpike in New London had been planned as far back as the 1950s. It was originally designated the Route 85 Expressway. Construction began in 1966 but was halted due to lack of funding. The half-finished expressway opened in 1972 as Route 11. Plans to finish Route 11 were revived in the late 1990s due to increased traffic in the area (primarily due to Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun). Contrary to local opposition to new highways, most of the residents of the area were in favor of completing the highway. Subsequently, Route 11 was submitted to the U.S. Department of Transportation for inclusion on the federal government's \\"fast-track\\" streamlining process, designed for federal agencies to quickly complete necessary steps on stalled projects, and was approved in August 2004. Funding for Route 11 has also been included in the proposed 2006 Connecticut state transportation bill. The State of Connecticut purchased, and still owns, the right-of-way for the project in Salem. The Final Environmental Impact Statement for extending Route 11 was issued on October 26, 2007. The EIS was published three months behind schedule due to a dispute between ConnDOT and the consulting firm that prepared the EIS‚Äîthe Macguire Group‚Äîover payment for services rendered. A Record of Decision from federal officials was expected by the end of 2007,Key Step Forward for Route 11, New London Day, October 27, 2007 but the Environmental Protection Agency had expressed concern over the environmental mitigation plan for Route 11, and expressed it still favored the Route 82/85 upgrade over extending Route 11\\\\. Because the EPA has veto power over Army Corps of Engineers permits, EPA opposition could have forced the delay or cancellation of the Route 11 extension. In December 2007, Federal Highway Administration extended the FEIS review period through the end of January 2008 to provide the EPA with a detailed environmental mitigation plan. Additionally state and federal elected officials requested the FHWA and ConnDOT present a detailed financial management plan for activities related to the extension. In September 2009, ConnDOT indicated that due to funding constraints, it will indefinitely suspend further work on Route 11\\\\. CT 11 approaching its intersection with CT 2 In 2011, Governor Dan Malloy indicated that completing Route 11 to the I-95/I-395 interchange was a high priority for the state and ordered ConnDOT to resume environmental and funding studies. In August 2011, ConnDOT initiated a financial study that focused on building the Route 11 extension as a toll road, which could potentially accelerate construction of the extension by using a combination of funds from tolls and traditional state and federal highway funds.Route 11 Financial Study to Begin this Month Including the Distribution of Driver Surveys at Various Locations in Southeast Connecticut, Connecticut Department of Transportation, Aug 4, 2011 The final section of Route 11 was proposed to be built not to Interstate highway standards. While it would have been built as a fully controlled-access freeway, it would not have met Interstate standards due to two key design features: First, opposing lanes of traffic would have been separated by a concrete Jersey barrier versus the wide median on the existing Route 11 section. Secondly, the greenway was being planned to have curve radii that would have been tighter than what is allowed by Interstate standards, although it would have still had a design speed of . With these two features, Route 11 would have been built using a footprint that was less than half the size required for an expressway built to Interstate standards. The Route 11 Greenway Authority was created by the state legislature in 2000 as a committee designated with the responsibility of purchasing land on either side of the completed Route 11 to be preserved as hiking and biking trails and open space. As of 2010, the Authority still held monthly meetings and the funds from the State of Connecticut still existed to purchase land for the Greenway, despite the near certainty the expressway itself would never be completed. The Authority did not have the power of eminent domain. The cross-section profile for the Route 11 Greenway would have been similar to that of the Route 8 expressway through the Naugatuck State Forest between Beacon Falls and Naugatuck. Extension cancelled On October 19, 2016, the Federal Highway Administration published a notice in the Federal Register announcing the withdrawal of the Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement, that effectively ceased any further work on the Route 11 extension.Route 11 project given a death notice, The Day, October 19, 2016 The major issues cited in the FHWA and ConnDOT abandoning the Route 11 extension include: opposition from the Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA has long opposed the extension of the Route 11 freeway, and would not approve any \\"build\\" alternative), the prohibitive cost and lack of funding for the extension, and the discovery of Native American and colonial-era archaeological sites along the route that could not be avoided. Local officials who have long supported completing Route 11 conceded that spot improvements to the Route 85 corridor could be done more quickly and at a much lower cost than extending Route 11 to I-95.Route 11 is out, Route 85 is in as council revises transportation plan, Norwich Bulletin, March 25, 2019 Unused bridges, roadbed and ramps The northernmost mile (1.6 km) of the Route 11 extension would have been built more to Interstate standards as it transitioned between the Greenway profile and the profile of the existing segment ending at Exit 4 in Salem. When Route 11 opened to its present-day terminus at Route 82, crews had cleared and graded the roadbed for about a mile beyond Route 82 for the anticipated extension south, including two deep rock cuts and a pair of unused bridges over Route 82 just past present terminus. Two \\"ghost ramps\\" built during the 1970s would have been paved as the new roadway was built, creating full diamond interchange at Exit 4. The bridges, ramps, and rock cuts, as well as unused storm drains, were left behind when work stopped on Route 11 in 1972. An interchange with Interstate 95 and 395 was also planned to be built as part of the highway extension, and accounted for about half of the $1 billion cost of the project. Exit list Exit numbers are currently sequential, but are scheduled to be converted to mile-based numbering starting in 2022. Mileage will be based on the originally-planned southern terminus at I-95 that includes the approximately 9-mile unbuilt section from Route 82 to I-95.

They performed at police stations to entertain the officers, and also gave public concerts in aid of police charities. The Minstrels wore evening dress and blackface makeup, in the manner of the typical minstrel shows of the period, and sang negro spirituals and popular ballads and songs, as well as playing instrumentals. They also performed comedy sketches, originally written for them by the popular music hall artiste and pantomime dame Clarkson Rose. The Minstrels were very popular - in the 1928/29 season alone, they gave about 140 performances. Seats for the public concerts were sold door-to-door by uniformed Sergeants. Commissioners Sir William Horwood and Lord Byng both objected to this, as did the Police Federation, claiming that people may feel intimidated into buying tickets and that it detracted from the dignity of the rank. The Minstrels survived by pointing to the amounts of money they raised for charity. However, Lord Trenchard discovered that ticket sales were entirely dependent on this method of selling and felt that this was a form of blackmail. In 1932, he ordered that the door-to-door selling should cease. The Minstrels attempted to continue by selling tickets from theatre box offices and police stations, but were disbanded the following year. The Minstrels raised a total of ¬£250,000 for the Metropolitan and City Police Orphanage, the Metropolitan and City Police Convalescent Home Fund, and the Widows' and Relief Funds. Trenchard set up the Commissioner's Fund to replace this vital source of income for these police charities. The most prominent member of the Minstrels was Sir James Olive, the first Deputy Commissioner, who had been a founder member in 1872 and later became the group's president.

Its colour, pale pink, is one of the rarest to be found in diamonds. The diamond is currently found in the Iranian Crown Jewels collection of Central Bank of Iran in Tehran.  Dimensions  It is 41.40 x 29.50 x 12.15 mm and weighing around 182 metric carats, the world's largest known pink diamond. History This diamond, like the Koh-i-Noor, was mined in Vijayawada, India. It was originally owned by the Kakatiya dynasty, later it was possessed by the Khalji dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate and to Mughal emperors. It was part of Shah Jahan's Peacock Throne. In 1739, Nader Shah of Iran invaded Northern India, occupied Delhi. As payment for returning the crown of India to the Mughal emperor, Muhammad, he took possession of the entire fabled treasury of the Mughals, including the Daria-i-Noor, in addition to the Koh-i-Noor and the Peacock Throne. After Nader Shah's death in 1747, the diamond was inherited by his grandson, Sharukh Mirza. From there, it fell into the hands of the Lotf Ali Khan. After Lotf Ali Khan's defeat at the hands of Mohammad Khan Qajar, who established the ruling Qajar dynasty of Iran, the Daria-i-Noor entered the Qajar treasury. During this time, Naser al-Din Shah Qajar was said to be very fond of the diamond, often wearing it as an armband, aigrette, or a brooch and maintenance of the diamond was an honor bestowed upon higher ranking individuals. Possible association Drawing of the Great Table diamond, by Tavernier in 1676 Noor-ul-Ain tiara In 1965, a Canadian team conducting research on the Iranian Crown Jewels concluded that the Daria-i- Noor may well have been part of a large pink diamond that had been studded in the throne of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, and had been described in the journal of the French jeweller Jean-Baptiste Tavernier in 1642, who called it the Great Table diamond (\\"Diamanta Grande Table\\"). This diamond may have been cut into two pieces; the larger part is the Daria-i-Noor; the smaller part is believed to be the Noor-ul-Ain diamond, presently studded in a tiara also in the Iranian Imperial collection.https://www.britannica.com/topic/Darya-e- Nur#ref92943 See also * Elizabeth II's jewels * Golconda Diamonds * Great Table diamond * Koh-i-Noor diamond * Noor-ul-Ain * List of diamonds * List of largest rough diamonds References External links *Treasury of National Jewels of Iran Category:Iranian National Jewels Category:Jewels of the Mughal Empire Category:Individual diamonds Category:Pink diamonds Category:Golconda diamonds Category:Dhaka Nawab family ","title":"Daria-i-Noor"},{"id":"4263842","text":"Lake Hood Seaplane Base is a state-owned seaplane base located three nautical miles (6 km) southwest of the central business district of Anchorage in the U.S. state of Alaska.

Tullio Avoledo (born 1 June 1957) is an Italian novelist. Biography Avoledo was born in Valvasone, in Friuli. After earning a degree in law, he worked as legal counselor for banks. His first novel, L'elenco telefonico di Atlantide, was released in January 2003 by the minor Italian publisher Sironi. It turned into a best-seller and won the Fort Village Montblanc Award for the best debutant writer. Avoledo could pull the reader into a science-fictional narrative involving a mysterious global plot and a character modeled on himself. Mare di Bering, his second novel, was published in November of the same year. His last novel for Sironi was Lo stato dell'unione in 2005. In the same year his first novel for Einaudi, one of the most renowned Italian publishers (which had also issued pocket editions of the former two), was released, under the title Tre sono le cose misteriose. Avoledo won the prestigious Grinzane Award with this fourth book in 2006. The following Breve storia di lunghi tradimenti loosely alludes to characters (like Giulio Rovedo and Cecilia Mazzi) and situations of L'elenco telefonico di Atlantide, but it has a new plot set in a world of global economics and of industrial delocalization. A movie inspired by this novel was released in 2013. La ragazza di Vajont is set in a dystopian alternate Italy dominated by a fascist regime, and plunged into a seemingly endless winter. L'ultimo giorno felice is a short novel which Avoledo wrote for Legambiente, an Italian environmental organization. The plot is centered on the predicament of a young architect, Francesco Salvador, selling his soul to the mafia for money. The novel describes the last hours of Francesco, during an exclusive tour of the Venetian lagoon. Science fiction is often present in the works of Avoledo. Avoledo's novel L'anno dei dodici inverni (2009) deals with time travel, love and redemption, in a mix of science fiction themes and a realistic narrative approach to the feelings and emotions of the characters. In 2011 he published another science fiction novel, Un buon posto per morire, in collaboration with Davide \\"Boosta\\" Dileo, keyboard player of the Turinese band Subsonica. The novel won the Emilio Salgari Prize 2012 for the best Italian adventure novel. He also wrote Metro 2033: Le radici del cielo, and Metro 2033: La crociata dei bambini written for the Metro 2033 Universe project set up by Dmitry Glukhovski. Both books have been published in Italy by Multiplayer.it. The last novel of the Metro 2033 trilogy - Metro 2033: Il Conclave delle tenebre will be published in 2018. Tullio Avoledo is running for the Italian Senate at the national elections of March 5, 2018, as a member of the Friulan party \\"Patto per l'Autonomia\\".

They are also used to estimate term fetal weight. The maneuvers consist of four distinct actions, each helping to determine the position of the fetus. The maneuvers are important because they help determine the position and lie of the fetus, which in conjunction with correct assessment of the shape of the maternal pelvis can indicate whether the delivery is going to be complicated, or whether a caesarean section is necessary. The examiner's skill and practice in performing the maneuvers are the primary factor in whether the fetal lie is correctly ascertained. Alternately, position can be determined by ultrasound performed by a sonographer or physician. Performing the maneuvers Leopold's maneuvers are difficult to perform on obese women and women who have polyhydramnios. The palpation can sometimes be uncomfortable for the woman if care is not taken to ensure she is relaxed and adequately positioned. To aid in this, the health care provider should first ensure that the woman has recently emptied her bladder. If she has not, she may need to have a straight urinary catheter inserted to empty it if she is unable to micturate herself. The woman should lie on her back with her shoulders raised slightly on a pillow and her knees drawn up a little. Her abdomen should be uncovered, and most women appreciate it if the individual performing the maneuver warms their hands prior to palpation. First maneuver: fundal grip While facing the woman, palpate the woman's upper abdomen with both hands. An obstetrician can often determine the size, consistency, shape, and mobility of the form that is felt. The fetal head is hard, round, and moves independently of the trunk while the buttocks feel softer, are symmetric, and the shoulders and limbs have small bony processes; unlike the head, they move with the trunk. Second maneuver: umbilical grip After the upper abdomen has been palpated and the form that is found is identified, the individual performing the maneuver attempts to determine the location of the fetal back. Still facing the woman, the health care provider palpates the abdomen with gentle but also deep pressure using the palm of the hands. First the right hand remains steady on one side of the abdomen while the left hand explores the right side of the woman's uterus. This is then repeated using the opposite side and hands. The fetal back will feel firm and smooth while fetal extremities (arms, legs, etc.) should feel like small irregularities and protrusions. The fetal back, once determined, should connect with the form found in the upper abdomen and also a mass in the maternal inlet, lower abdomen. Third maneuver: first pelvic grip or Pawlik's grip In the third maneuver the health care provider attempts to determine what fetal part is lying above the inlet, or lower abdomen. The individual performing the maneuver first grasps the lower portion of the abdomen just above the pubic symphysis with the thumb and fingers of the right hand. This maneuver should yield the opposite information and validate the findings of the first maneuver. If the woman enters labor, this is the part which will most likely come first in a vaginal birth. If it is the head and is not actively engaged in the birthing process, it may be gently pushed back and forth. The Pawlik's grip, although still used by some obstetricians, is not recommended as it is more uncomfortable for the woman. Instead, a two-handed approach is favored by placing the fingers of both hands laterally on either side of the presenting part. Fourth maneuver: Leopold's second pelvic grip  The last maneuver requires that the health care provider face the woman's feet, as he or she will attempt to locate the fetus' brow. The fingers of both hands are moved gently down the sides of the uterus toward the pubis. The side where there is resistance to the descent of the fingers toward the pubis is greatest is where the brow is located. If the head of the fetus is well-flexed, it should be on the opposite side from the fetal back. If the fetal head is extended though, the occiput is instead felt and is located on the same side as the back. Cautions Leopold's maneuvers are intended to be performed by health care professionals, as they have received the training and instruction in how to perform them. If performed at home as an informational exercise, the examiner should take care to not roughly or excessively disturb the fetus. It is important to note that all findings are not truly diagnostic, and as such ultrasound may be required to conclusively determine the fetal position.

Sometimes referred to as being in Carpiquet in Greater Caen, the theme park receives approximately 110,000 visitors a year. Background Parc Festyland is a true theme park as it has a central unifying theme in accordance with which the whole park - from rides to restaurants to surroundings - is built. The theme of Parc Festyland is the 1066 era. Being a family theme park, it concentrates on the architecture and personalities of the time. The park's logo is a friendly, young-looking dragon's head sporting a Viking hat and a large grin. Visiting Figures In 2005, the park received 110,000 visitors, compared to Caen's five museums which received 550,000 visitors between them (source: Caen tourist office). Advertising Parc Festyland runs an advertising campaign in association with the Caen tourist office.

The band has released six albums and four EPs since its inception in 1999. Their music has been described as \\"Soundgarden, Tool, Black Sabbath, Oceansize and Pink Floyd taking copious amounts of mind-altering substances and venturing on a trip through time and space (to another dimension), and back again.\\" Their music is characterised by guitarist Sel Balamir's effect pedals, Matt Brobin's complex drumming, extended heavy sections, atmospheric compositions and philosophical lyrics. Their self-titled debut album, Amplifier, was released in 2004 by Music for Nations. Their second album, Insider was released in Europe in 2006 on the SPV label. Their third album, The Octopus, was released to fans in December 2010 ahead of a full release in January 2011. Their fourth album, Echo Street was released in 2013, and the fifth album, Mystoria, was released in September 2014. They are often cited as one of the most underrated bands of the UK's rock scene, although they retain a strong cult following around Europe. History Early career and Amplifier (1998‚Äì2005) After forming around 1998 Amplifier toured the UK and recorded a few demos and sent promo CDs to labels and the press. After being signed in May 2002 by British label Music for Nations, Amplifier were asked to support Deftones at Manchester Apollo. After the two singles \\"The Consultancy\\" (b/w \\"Glory Electricity\\") and \\"Neon\\" (b/w \\"Boomtime\\" and \\"Throwaway\\"), the band‚Äôs self-titled debut album, Amplifier, was released on 6 June 2004 by Music for Nations ‚Äì which is a subsidiary of the larger label distributor Zomba Records - and was very well received by English media and critics. As well as the standard 10-track jewel case, the album was released as a 13-track digipak. The extra tracks were the two segues (\\"Drawing No 1\\" and \\"Drawing No 2\\") and new track \\"Half-Life\\". The label ran out of funds and was bought-out by Sony, which was not interested in working with smaller bands. After buying the rights for the album back the band went label-hunting. In 2005, they signed a deal with SPV (Germany). The debut was re-released in May 2005 with a second disc containing the three B-sides and \\"Half-Life\\" and videos for the singles \\"The Consultancy\\" and \\"Neon\\". Throughout 2005, the band toured across both the UK and Europe. The EP \\"The Astronaut Dismantles HAL\\", which contains 6 songs as well as a hidden track, was released on 17 October 2005. In 2006, the band played numerous festival dates including opening the main-stage at Download Festival, UK. Insider (2006‚Äì2008) Their second album, titled Insider includes 12 tracks, three of which were posted to the band's MySpace before the album's release. The band also recorded extra tracks to be used as future B-sides. The album was released on 29 September 2006 in Germany and Austria and 2 October in the rest of Europe on SPV in a digipak with 12 page booklet. \\"Procedures\\" was chosen as a radio single to promote the album and has been played by Zane Lowe on Radio One. No singles from the album will be released to the public. A video for \\"Procedures\\" was filmed during the band's Munich show, on the European tour. After their own UK and European tour, Amplifier were main support for Opeth's European Tour. During their European tour in early 2007 they were supported by the Swiss indie rock band Cloudride. Before taking time to write and record their third album Amplifier were main support to Porcupine Tree on their UK tour in April 2007. The Octopus (2009‚Äì2012) In March 2008, Amplifier confirmed that they were recording their third and fourth albums simultaneously. In January 2010, Amplifier confirmed that this had changed and that they planned to release the combined works as a double album, named The Octopus. The album was released online a year later in 2011, quickly followed by a full release on 21 February 2011. It was met with generally positive acclaim in the press. After his former band Oceansize had broken up, guitarist Steve Durose joined Amplifier for their 2011 tour. In mid-2012 the band announced the departure of Neil Mahony who was replaced by Alexander \\"Magnum\\" Redhead for the band's support tour with Anathema the same year. Echo Street and Sunriders EP (2013‚Äì2014) Their fourth album Echo Street was released in March 2013. The band stated that they recorded the album in sixty days. It is also their first effort under their new record label, Kscope and the first one to chart, peaking at number 90 on the German Albums Chart. The band began touring in mainland Europe and the UK in spring, after headlining the Pearl Festival in Hyderabad, India. On 20 November 2013, the Sunriders EP was released online. Mystoria and Residue EP (2014‚Äì2015) The band moved to the Superball Music label early in 2014 and began work on their fifth album, Mystoria, recording at Monnow Valley Studio in the May of that year. The album was released on 8 September 2014 in the UK and mainland Europe, and on 30 September in the USA. It is their first record to break into the Top 100 in the UK, peaking at 97, and at number 91 on the German Albums Chart. The band resumed touring by adding dates around Europe in October and the UK in November. The band released the Residue EP, which was limited to 500 copies and was sold on the tour. Trippin' With Dr. Faustus and Rockosmos (2016‚Äìpresent) After the release of Mystoria, the band decided to start their own independent label, Rockosmos. Besides releasing their own music on it, they signed local acts such as AWOOGA, Dead Blonde Stars or Thumpermonkey among others. In June 2017, the band's 6th studio record, Trippin' With Dr. Faustus was released in several formats. Starting December 2017, an EP of outtakes, called Record was available as a digital download. In 2018, Amplifier re-released their critically acclaimed, self-titled debut LP on the Rockosmos label as CD and 2LP, followed in April 2019 by The Octopus on 4LP. This is the first vinyl release for the latter, limited to 500 copies.  Live performances  Amplifier's live stage performance is dominated by Sel Balamir's use of many effects and loops controlled by a large board of pedals and controls, a similar (if smaller) arrangement also used by Alex Redhead for bass guitar. The combinations of effects lead to a sound much greater than the number of performers would normally be able to produce, and unusual sounds and soundscapes that would otherwise require additional musicians with different instruments, but without diminishing the 'live' feel. Amplifier have a devoted following as a live band, particularly in mainland Europe, and amongst members of the Manchester music community. Amplifier released a DVD/CD package entitled Live in Berlin in 2009, comprising the following tracks \\"Continuum\\", \\"Fall of the Empire\\", \\"Panzer\\", \\"Motorhead\\", \\"The Wave\\", \\"Interglacial Spell\\", \\"Interstellar\\", \\"Golden Ratio\\" and \\"Neon\\".

Beyond a simple agreement about it being linked to some kind of measurement of performance there is little consensus about how to define or use performance measures. In the light of this what has happened is the emergence of organising frameworks that incorporate performance measures and often also proscribe methods for choosing and using the appropriate measures for that application. The most common such frameworks include: * Balanced scorecard‚Äîused by organisations to manage the implementation of corporate strategies * Key performance indicator‚Äîa method for choosing important/critical performance measures, usually in an organisational context Operational standards often include pre-defined lists of standard performance measures. For example EN 15341CEN (2007). EN 15341: Maintenance ‚Äì Maintenance key performance indicators. European Committee for Standardization (CEN), Brussels. identifies 71 performance indicators, whereof 21 are technical indicators, or those in a US Federal Government directive from 1999‚ÄîNational Partnership for Reinventing Government, USA; Balancing Measures: Best Practices in Performance Management, August 1999. Defining performance measures or methods by which they can be chosen is also a popular activity for academics‚Äîfor example a list of railway infrastructure indicators is offered by Stenstr√∂m et al., a novel method for measure selection is proposed by Mendibil et al. Academic articles that provide critical reviews of performance measurement in specific domains are also common‚Äîe.g. Ittner's observations on non-financial reporting by commercial organisations, or Boris et al.'s observations about use of performance measurement in non-profit organisations.Boris, E.

It stars Ben Gazzara, Peter Falk, and Cassavetes as three middle class men in the throes of a midlife crisis following the death of a close friend. Distributed by Columbia Pictures, Husbands polarized critics upon release. Jay Cocks of Time described it as Cassavetes's finest work, but other critics, including Vincent Canby, Pauline Kael, and Roger Ebert, lambasted it. Plot Gus, Harry, and Archie are three nominally happy husbands with families in suburban New York. All are professional men, driven and successful. The three of them have known each other since their school years. They have grown up together and have now had enough time to discover that their youth is disappearing and that there is nothing they can do to preserve it. They are shaken into confronting this reality when their best friend Stuart dies suddenly and unexpectedly of a heart attack. After the funeral, they spend two days hanging out, playing basketball, sleeping in the subways, and drinking, including an impromptu singing contest at a bar. Harry goes home, has a vicious argument with his wife, and decides to fly to London. The other two decide to go with him. They check into an expensive hotel, dress in formal clothing, and meet three young women at a gambling casino. They go back to their rooms with the women. Gus pairs off with Mary, Archie with Julie, a young Asian woman who appears not to speak English, and Harry with Pearl. However, their efforts to hook up with these women are awkward and unsuccessful. Gus and Archie return to New York, but Harry stays behind. Gus and Archie express concern about Harry and what he will do without them. Production Cassavetes has stated that this was a very personal film for him, having experienced the loss of a loved one after his older brother died at the age of 30. Cassavetes wrote the dialogue after improvising with Falk and Gazzara, and built the characters around the personalities of the actors. Falk said that he was asked by Cassavetes to appear in Husbands at a lunch meeting at which Cassavetes agreed to appear with Falk in the 1976 Elaine May film Mikey and Nicky. Falk said that he and Gazzara contributed to the Husbands script, but that the story, structure and scenes were devised by Cassavetes. Falk suggested the scene at the end of the movie where Archie and Gus arrive home and divide up the gifts. A scene between Archie and Julie was improvised in a hotel room, with Cassavetes at the camera and no other crew present. Release Promotion On September 18, 1970, Cassavetes, Falk, and Gazzara appeared on The Dick Cavett Show, ostensibly to promote the release of Husbands. However, they actively avoided almost every question Cavett asked about the film, and later admitted to drinking alcohol before the show. Running time edits Cassavetes cut around 85 minutes of footage from the film in order to shorten it to its contractual requirement of 140 minutes. After the film was released, distributor Columbia Pictures cut removed an additional 11 minutes from the film in response to negative reviews and audience walkouts. Critical reception Upon release, Husbands received disparate reviews from critics. Jay Cocks of Time wrote that \\"Husbands may be one of the best movies anyone will ever see. It is certainly the best movie anyone will ever live through.\\" He described it as an important and great film, and as Cassavetes' finest work. In response, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that \\"seldom has Time given a better review to a worse movie.\\" Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, and wrote that it \\"shows an important director not merely failing, but not even understanding why.\\" He also criticized the improvisations, writing: \\"There are long passages of dialogue in which the actors seem to be trying to think of something to say.\\" Pauline Kael of The New Yorker described Husbands as \\"infantile and offensive.\\" Writing for The New York Times, critic Vincent Canby called the film \\"unbearably long\\", and concluded of the three characters that \\"when it's all over, they are tired, but not much wiser‚Äîwhich is pretty much the sum and substance of Husbands.\\" Tony Mastroianni of the Cleveland Press wrote that the \\"[film's] dialog consists of fragments, of exclamations, of three actors trying to upstage each other. What has been done is undisciplined and what has been given us is unselective. The camera runs and simply photographs everything that passes before it. The microphone listens. It is like a big budget home movie.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune included the film on his list of top 10 films of the year. In a retrospective assessment of the film, Philip French of The Observer called it \\"highly uneven, painfully drawn- out, deeply sincere, wildly misogynistic and at times agonisingly tedious. It is also intermittently brilliant, with moments of piercing honesty. There is, however, not a single memorable line of dialogue or anything that might pass for wit. On the other hand, Cassavetes's gifts as a director of actors are evident.\\" Conversely, Richard Brody of The New Yorker called the film a \\"formally radical, deeply personal work\\" that \\"still packs plenty of surprises.\\" Dave Calhoun of Time Out also gave the film a positive review, awarding it four out of five stars. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Husbands holds an approval rating of 64% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews, with an average score of 6.32/10. Home media In August 2009, Husbands was released on DVD, with the 11 minutes that had been cut by Columbia Pictures restored. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by the Criterion Collection on May 26, 2020.

Following the independence of Chad, he served as its first Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1960 to 1961. Life and career He was born on December 28, 1920 at Maibyan, near Moissala, in the prefecture of Moyen-Chari in southern Chad. He served as a diplomat at Brazzaville and worked for a long time as a teacher in places like Ati, Ab√©ch√©, Bongor and Fort-Archambault (now called Sarh). When Chad was still a French colony, a Representative Council for which some of the African inhabitants could vote was instituted. Toura entered politics and became a member of this council from 1946 to 1956. A year later, he founded the Chadian Progressive Party (PPT) with Gabriel Lisette, in which Toura became secretary-general and Lisette president. The 1956 reforms greatly boosted the suffrage, strengthening the PPT, which triumphed in the first democratic elections. Toura was among the PPT representatives elected and became Minister of Agriculture in the first black government led by Lisette in 1958. But in February, Lisette lost his position and a month later Toura lost his office in the party to Fran√ßois Tombalbaye, who, later in the same month, became the new head of the government. This position was strengthened by the following elections in May, which were triumphantly won by the PPT. A new government was formed, headed by Tombalbaye and with Toura as Minister of Public Works. With the independence of Chad on August 11, 1960, Tombalbaye became President and Toura was made Minister of Foreign Affairs. As such he headed the Chadian delegation that on September 29, 1960 was present at the United Nations General Assembly that admitted Chad into the UN. In 1961, Toura became Minister of National Education. Nevertheless, Tombalbaye had become increasingly suspicious and authoritarian. As a result, Toura fell in disgrace and was arrested in 1962. He remained in jail for several years, after which the President decided he could use him as a diplomat and sent him as Ambassador to West Germany in 1966. In 1973, Toura resigned and went into exile in France. In Paris he wrote Non √† Tombalbaye! - Fragments autobiographiques, a critique of the Tombalbaye Regime (1974). By August, the work started circulating secretly in Chad among opponents of the President.

It is situated on the right bank of the Rhine, approx. 15 km (10 mi) northwest of Neuwied, and 30 km (20 mi) southeast of Bonn. Bad H√∂nningen is the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde (\\"collective municipality\\") Bad H√∂nningen. The town contains three other districts called Ariendorf, Girgenrath and Reidenbruch. History Bad H√∂nningen Arenfels castle Archeological findings suggest that the first settlers lived here over 1800 years ago when the Romans occupied the Rhineland. The limes ran between Bad H√∂nningen and Rheinbrohl, opposite the Vinxtbach, the border between Germania Inferior and Superior. At this point the limes crossed the Rhine and continued on the eastern bank. On this site a small castellum was built. In 1972 a Roman watchtower was reconstructed from archeological finds. In 1019, the town was documentary mentioned as \\"Besitztum Hohingen\\" for the first time. During Thirty Years' War in 1632 Bad H√∂nningen burned down except twelve houses. The first bathhouse for medical treatment opened in 1895. Because of this, the town is legitimated to have the title \\"Bad\\" since 1950. On July 12, 1969, it was granted the privileges of a town.

Function  FLAP is necessary for the activation of 5-lipoxygenase and therefore for the production of leukotrienes, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid, and specialized pro-resolving mediators of the lipoxin and resolvin classes. It is an integral protein within the nuclear membrane. FLAP is necessary in synthesis of leukotriene, which are lipid mediators of inflammation that is involved in respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. FLAP functions as a membrane anchor for 5-lipooxygenase and as an amine acid-bind protein. How FLAP activates 5-lipooxygenase is not completely understood, but there is a physical interaction between the two. FLAP structure consist of 4 transmembrane alpha helices, but they are found in 3‚Äôs( trimer) forming a barrel. The barrel is about 60 A high and 36 A wide.;  Clinical significance  Leukotrienes, which need the FLAP protein to be made, have an established pathological role in allergic and respiratory diseases. Animal and human genetic evidence suggests they may also have an important role in atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and stroke.

Prior to his election to the Senate, he served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 1st District from 2001 to 2010. Background Evers was born in Milton, Florida, and grew up on his family's farm, later attending Pensacola Junior College, and then eventually joining his family's fertilizer business. When he became the owner of the business, he moved it to Baker, where he started growing cotton, soybeans, peanuts, wheat, and corn. Florida House of Representatives In 2001, when United States Congressman Joe Scarborough, who represented Florida's 1st congressional district, resigned, State Representative Jeff Miller ran in the special election to succeed him, and resigned from his seat in the legislature. A special election was called to replace Miller in the 1st District, which included northern Escambia County, northwestern Okaloosa County, and northern Santa Rosa County. Evers ran in the special election, and faced Mary Golden, the wife of State Attorney Curtis Golden; C. Robert Hilliard, an attorney; Donald Middlebrooks, a salesman; Jim Reeves, a former State Representative and Pensacola City Councilman; and Floyd Rose, a retired sheriff in the Republican primary. Hilliard ended up receiving a plurality of the vote in the initial primary election, receiving 27% of the vote to Evers' 25%, Reeves' 24%, Golden's 17%, Middlebrooks' 4%, and Rose's 2%, but because he did not receive a majority, a runoff election was held between Evers and Hilliard. In a close election, Evers narrowly defeated Hilliard, winning 54% of the vote to Hilliard's 46%. Advancing to the general election, Evers faced Eddie Cook, the Democratic nominee and a retired oil technician. Owing to the conservative nature of the district, Evers defeated Cook in a landslide, winning his first term in the legislature with 77% of the vote. When Evers ran for re-election in 2002 to his first full term, he was challenged in the Republican primary by Santa Rosa County Commissioner Byrd Mapoles. During the campaign, Evers' daughter found the cell phone of Mapoles' son next to an Evers roadside campaign sign that had been knocked down, which resulted in a grand jury investigation that ultimately cleared Mapoles' son of criminal charges. Evers ended up defeating Mapoles handily, winning renomination with 73% of the vote. He was re-elected unopposed in the general election that year, and then again in 2004 and 2006. In 2008, he faced Ryan Gilbert in the Republican primary, but defeated him easily, winning renomination with 76% of the vote, and was re-elected in the general election without opposition. Florida Senate When State Senator Durell Peaden was unable to seek re-election due to term limits, Evers ran to succeed him in the 2nd District, which stretched from Panama City to Pensacola and included northern Bay County, northern Escambia County, Holmes County, northern Okaloosa County, northern Santa Rosa County, northern Walton County, and Washington County. He was originally set to face fellow State Representative Dave Murzin in the Republican primary, but Murzin opted to run for a seat on the Escambia County Commission instead, so Evers faced Tea Party activist Mike Hill. Despite Hill racking up a number of local endorsements, Evers significantly outraised him, and ended up defeating him in a landslide, receiving 71% of the vote to Hill's 29%. In the general election, Evers was opposed by Christopher S. Crawford, the Tea Party nominee, and defeated him by a wide margin with 79% of the vote. In 2012, following the reconfiguration of the state's legislative districts, the 2nd District was redrawn and made more compact, trading the reach down to Panama City for more of Escambia and Santa Rosa Counties. Evers ran for re-election, which he won unopposed. When he sought re-election in 2014, he won uncontested again. Evers wrote a number of pieces of legislation concerning guns. Following the Marissa Alexander case, Evers wrote legislation that exempted certain acts of self-defense from a law that required twenty years of jail time if a gun was fired during the commission of certain felonies, and the bill was eventually signed into law by Governor Rick Scott. He also authored legislation, nicknamed the \\"Pop Tart\\" bill, that prevented schools from \\"disciplining students who play with simulated weapons\\", which was also signed into law. In 2015, Evers joined State Representative Greg Steube to author legislation that would have allowed individuals with concealed-carry permits to bring guns onto college and university campuses, but the bill ultimately died in the Florida Senate when the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Miguel D√≠az de la Portilla, refused to bring it up in committee. 2016 Congressional election Evers announced that in 2016 he would run for election to Florida's 1st congressional district; the incumbent, Republican Jeff Miller, was not running for re-election. On August 30, 2016, Evers lost the Republican primary to State Representative Matt Gaetz by 21.5% to 35.7%.

Background The Allied April 1945 offensive on the Italian front, which was to end the Italian campaign and the war in Italy, was to decisively break through the German Gothic Line, the defensive line along the Apennines and the River Po plain to the Adriatic Sea and swiftly drive north to occupy Northern Italy and get to the Austrian and Yugoslav borders as quickly as possible. However, German strongpoints, as well as bridge, road, levee and dike blasting, and any occasional determined resistance in the Po Valley plain might slow the planned sweep down. Allied planners felt that dropping paratroops onto some key areas and locales south of the River Po could help wreak havoc in the German rear area, attack German communications and vehicle columns, further disrupting the German retreat, and prevent German engineers from blowing up key structures before Allied spearheads could exploit them. Lieutenant General Sir Richard McCreery, commander of the Commonwealth 8th Army, had a number of Italian paratroopers at hand for the task. History In March 1945, the airborne forces of the Allied-aligned Esercito Cobelligerante Italiano (Italian Co-belligerent Army) comprised: the 114-strong \\"F\\" Reconnaissance Squadron, which was made up of 12 sections/squads under Captain Carlo Gay, and; a 112-strong contingent, led by Lieutenant Guerrino Ceiner, that had defected from the Axis-aligned 184¬™ Divisione paracadutisti \\"Nembo\\": four platoons, each made up of three sections/squads. After being assigned to Operation Herring, the Italian paratroopers received a rapid but thorough training update under the supervision of a British SOE officer, Major Alex Ramsay, who was reportedly pleased by the Italian paratroopers' performance. Italian parachutists en route to the drop zone of Operation Herring The mission would entail eight battle drops on as many areas south of Po River, southeast of Ferrara, the Mirandola area, and Poggio Rusco and the Modena-Mantua highway. It would last 36 hours. Every paratrooper was to be equipped with an Italian Beretta MAB submachine gun with 400 rounds, high explosive charges, four hand grenades, dagger, maps, and foodstuff for 48 hours. On the night of 19/20 April 1945, the Italian paratroopers, plus at least one British paratrooper who had joined them, jumped from 14 Douglas C-47 transport aircraft of the US 64th Troop Carrier Group. During the drop, they were scattered considerably, a few were captured upon landing, and 16 paracadutisti barricaded themselves in a farmhouse, after becoming surrounded by German forces; all but two of the Italians died while fighting until running out of ammunition. Other groups of paracadutisti proved to be more effective, inflicting heavy damage and suffering light casualties. Two squads from \\"F\\" Squadron (18 personnel) captured two small towns, Ravarino and Stuffione, took 451 prisoners and held out until the arrival of Allied ground forces. Some paracadutisti were effective to the point of notoriety ‚Äì several German prisoners were reportedly murdered in cold blood by their captors. The Germans reciprocated by killing some Italian prisoners, as well as a few civilians.. Aftermath German prisoners captured by italian paras (Mirandola, April 1945) Operation Herring lasted over 72 hours instead of the 36 initially foreseen, but it turned out to be a success. With some help on the part of the local partisan groups, according to some sources 481 German soldiers were killed, 1,083 surrendered, 44 vehicles were destroyed and many captured including some tanks, armored cars and guns, 77 telephone lines severed, three bridges taken intact, an ammunition storage site blown up. The price the Italians paid for the success was 31 dead (including a British paratroops sergeant) and 10-12 wounded. An Italian lieutenant and a private were posthumously awarded the Gold Medal for Valor.

A lot of the gags center around the character's interest in the opposite sex, most notably he and his pals coming up with ways of spying on the girls' showers and dressing room. Other topics concern religion and the contradictions and absurdities of the adult world.

Characters In La Jeunesse de Spirou, regular characters such as Fantasio, Spip the squirrel and their enemy Zantafio also featured as children.

He is the leading Scandinavian surrealist author, language anarchist, poet and text technician. He cannot be placed in any literary tradition, but his novels have recurring aspects of puns and wordplay, dadaistic eagerness and literary puzzles, and contain erotic digressions. His texts are extremely verbose with few visible threads, let alone plot or characterization, and have a distinct embellishment in a baroque pattern, partly with a Shakespearean solemnity.Whilde, Stefan (26 July 2006).

Leopold is widely known in his primary field for his work in fluvial geomorphology and for the classic book, Fluvial Processes in Geomorphology, that he wrote with Gordon Wolman and John Miller. Leopold suggested that a new philosophy of water management is needed, one based on geologic, geographic, and climatic factors as well as traditional economic, social, and political factors. He argued that the management of water resources cannot be successful as long as it is na√Øvely perceived from an economic and political standpoint, as it is in the status quo. Career From 1937 to 1940, Leopold worked as an engineer for the U.S. Soil Conservation Service in New Mexico. In 1940, he enlisted and was a part of the U.S. Army Weather Service and the Army Air Force. He was in the Army until 1946 and he rose from the rank of Private to Captain. From 1946 to 1950, Leopold served as the Chief Meteorologist of the Pineapple Research Institute, Hawaii. In 1950, he joined the U.S. Geological Survey. He worked for the USGS until 1972 serving as Hydraulic Engineer (1950‚Äì56), Chief Hydrologist (1956‚Äì66), and Senior Research Hydrologist (1966‚Äì72). In 1972, Leopold joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley as a professor in the Department of Geology and Geophysics and Department of Landscape Architecture.

The general process starts with modification of DNA with bisulfite, specifically to convert unmethylated cytosine in CpG sites to uracil, while leaving methylated cytosines untouched. The modified DNA region of interest is amplified via PCR and during the process, uracils are converted to thymine. The amplicons are labelled with a fluorescent dye and hybridized to oligonucleotide probes that are fixed to a glass slide. The probes differentially bind to cytosine and thymine residues, which ultimately allows discrimination between methylated and unmethylated CpG sites, respectively. A calibration curve is produced and compared with the microarray results of the amplified DNA samples. This allows a general quantification of the proportion of methylation present in the region of interest. This microarray technique was developed by Tim Hui-Ming Huang and his laboratory and was officially published in 2002. An example diagram of a MSO microarray that would be used to produce a calibration curve  Implications for cancer research  Cancer cells often develop atypical methylation patterns, at CpG sites in promoters of tumour suppressor genes. High levels of methylation at a promoter leads to downregulation of the corresponding genes and is characteristic of carcinogenesis. It is one of the most consistent changes observed in early stage tumour cells. Methylation specific oligonucleotide microarray allows for the high resolution and high throughput detection of numerous methylation events on multiple gene promoters. Therefore, this technique can be used to detect aberrant methylation in tumour suppressor promoters at an early stage and has been used in gastric and colon cancers and multiple others. Because it allows one to detect presence of atypical methylations in cancer cells, it can also be used to reveal the major cause behind the malignancy, whether its main contributor is mutations on chromosomes or epigenetic modifications, as well as which tumour suppressor genes' transcription levels are affected. An interesting use of this microarray includes specific classification of cancers based on the methylation patterns alone, such as differentiating between classes of leukemia, suggesting that different classes of cancer show relatively unique methylation patterns. This technique has also been proposed to monitor cancer treatments that involve modifying the methylation patterns in mutant cancer cells.

It belongs to the Georgian Orthodox Church and dates from the sixth century. History According to the old Georgian annals, the church was built by the King Dachi of Iberia (circa 522-534) who had made Tbilisi his capital. Originally dedicated to the Virgin Mary, it was renamed Anchiskhati (i.e., icon of Ancha) in 1675 when the treasured icon of the Savior created by the twelfth-century goldsmith Beka Opizari at the Ancha monastery in Klarjeti (in what is now part of northeast Turkey) was moved to Tbilisi so preserve it from an Ottoman invasion. The icon was preserved at the Basilica of St Mary for centuries (it is now on display at the Art Museum of Georgia). The Anchiskhati Church, 1890 The basilica was damaged and rebuilt on several occasions from the 15th through 17th centuries due to wars between Georgia and the Persians and Turks. The brick belfry near the Anchiskhati Basilica was built by Catholicos Domenti in 1675. The look of the structure was drastically changed in the 1870s, when a dome was added. During the Soviet period, all religious ceremonies at Anchiskhati Basilica were halted, and the building transformed into a museum for handicrafts. It was later used as an art studio. From 1958 to 1964 restoration works took place in celebration of the 1500th Jubilee of the founding of Tbilisi, which changed the view of the church back to the seventeenth-century version, however, it was not until 1991, after the independence of Georgia was restored, that the basilica reverted to religious use. The Anchiskhati Choir based out of the Anchiskhati Basilica is the world's leading exponent of Georgian polyphonic choral music. Architecture Anchiskhati Basilica is a three-span basilica, divided by two abutments forming horseshoe shaped conches, which indicates the antiquity of its construction. Originally constructed of blocks of yellow tuff stone, the 1958-1964 restoration made extensive use of brick. The structure has entrances on three sides, but today only the western entrance is in use. Aside from the altarpiece, which was painted in 1683 by order of Catholicos Nikoloz Amilakhvari, all of the remaining paintings in the church date from the 19th century.

It was re-released in 1993 along with With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness and then in 2003 with bonus tracks. Background information When At the Gates began recording The Red in the Sky Is Ours, the group had been together for a mere year. In comparison to 1991 EP Gardens of Grief, guitarist Anders Bj√∂rler feels that The Red in the Sky Is Ours is more structured. In certain instances, Bj√∂rler deems the record \\"experimental\\" nonetheless. At this time, the group's members started to learn about one another musically. Bj√∂rler was at the time very inspired by guitarist Alf Svensson's ideas, and called them \\"over the top\\" and \\"extremely challenging\\". However, Bj√∂rler went on to comment that the group \\"tried too hard to impress people with too many riffs and weird songwriting\\". Bj√∂rler has criticised the production also, dubbing it \\"weird\\" and \\"very weak-sounding\\". Reception Decibel awarded the album an induction into the Decibel Magazine Hall of Fame in September 2014, becoming the second At the Gates album to receive such award.

It has 213 bedrooms, including 52 suites, and is located on Saint Isaac's Square, next to Saint Isaac's Cathedral and across from the historic Imperial German Embassy. Hotel Astoria, along with its neighboring sister hotel, Angleterre Hotel, is owned and managed by Rocco Forte Hotels and is a member of The Leading Hotels of the World. The hotel underwent a complete refurbishment in 2012. History The Astoria was commissioned in 1910 by the Palace Hotel Company, based in the UK, which owned the land. It was designed by Russo-Swedish architect Fyodor Lidval, who developed a style based on Art Nouveau and also influenced by Neoclassical architecture. The hotel was constructed by the German firm of Wais and Freitag. It was built to host tourists visiting Russia for the Romanov tercentenary, a huge celebration of 300 years of Russian imperial rule in May 1913. Hotel Astoria opened on December 23, 1912. The luxurious hotel was used during the celebrations to house guests of the imperial family, and was afterwards popular with the aristocracy. Rasputin was said to stay there with some of his married lovers. The Angleterre and the Astoria in 1930 The Astoria soon proved such a success that the neighboring Angleterre Hotel was set for demolition for a huge expansion of the Astoria designed by Lidval, mirroring the existing building. However, the outbreak of World War I prevented this. After the Russian Revolution, the Hotel Astoria housed members of the Communist Party. Lenin spoke from its balcony in 1919. During World War II, the hotel served as a field hospital during the Siege of Leningrad. Adolf Hitler reportedly planned to hold a victory banquet in the hotel's Winter Garden. He was so convinced Leningrad would fall quickly that invitations to the event were printed in advance. The hotel was managed by the state-run Intourist group during the Soviet period, until it closed in 1987 for renovations. It reopened in 1989, completely restored. Rocco Forte Hotels purchased the hotel in December 1997 and spent $20 million on further renovations. The hotel was renovated again in 2012 for its centennial. Rocco Forte Hotels also owns and manages the adjacent Angleterre Hotel. It is marketed as the business-class wing of its more luxurious sister, the Astoria. The upper guest room floors of the two hotels are connected. Famous guests The hotel's many famous guests have included Lenin, Isadora Duncan, H. G. Wells, Alexander Vertinsky, Prince Charles, Luciano Pavarotti, Madonna, Elton John, Jack Nicholson, Vladimir Putin, Alain Delon, Gina Lollobrigida, Marcello Mastroianni, Pierre Cardin, Jean Paul Gaultier, Margaret Thatcher, Jacques Chirac, Tony Blair and U.S. President George W. Bush. Writer Mikhail Bulgakov spent his honeymoon at the hotel in 1932 and is said to have written parts of The Master and Margarita in room 412.

Additional music was provided by Masaharu Iwata and Hayato Matsuo, who also orchestrated the opening and ending themes. Former regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu's only work for this game was \\"Kiss Me Good- Bye\\", the theme song sung by Angela Aki. The Final Fantasy XII Original Soundtrack was released on four Compact Discs in 2006 by Aniplex. A sampling of tracks from the soundtrack was released as an album entitled Selections from Final Fantasy XII Original Soundtrack, and was released in 2006 by Tofu Records. Additionally, a promotional digital album titled The Best of Final Fantasy XII was released on the Japanese localization of iTunes for download only in 2006. \\"Kiss Me Good-Bye\\" was released by Epic Records as a single in 2006, and Symphonic Poem \\"Hope\\", the complete music from the game's end credits, was released by Hats Unlimited in 2006. An abridged version of the latter piece, which originally accompanied a promotional video for the game, was included in the official soundtrack album. An album of piano arrangements, titled Piano Collections Final Fantasy XII, was released by Square Enix in 2012. The soundtrack received mixed reviews from critics; while several felt that it was an excellent album, others disagreed, finding it to be a good soundtrack but lacking in substance. Common complaints about the album were the large number of filler tracks, which seemed to be uninspired and hurt the soundtrack as a whole. However, several reviewers commented on \\"Kiss Me Good- bye\\", finding it to be one of the soundtrack's strongest areas. The singles for the soundtrack were very well received by critics, who found them to be very enjoyable but short in duration, and the piano album was considered by reviewers to be one of the best in the series. The game's soundtrack was nominated for a British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for Best Original Score. Creation and influence Hitoshi Sakimoto was the lead composer of Final Fantasy XII Hitoshi Sakimoto composed most of the game's soundtrack; Nobuo Uematsu, following his departure from Square Enix in 2004, only contributed the theme song, \\"Kiss Me Good-Bye\\", sung by Angela Aki. Uematsu noted that Aki's style of playing the keyboard while singing reminded him of his childhood idol, Elton John, which was one of the reasons he chose her. Aki was approached for the role three years before the release of the game. She based her words for the song on \\"a scene of a new journey after good-bye\\", which was the sense she had gotten from Uematsu's melody, and was encouraged by Uematsu not to limit herself in her lyrics to what she thought the producers wanted. Sakimoto was brought in to compose the soundtrack to the game by Yasumi Matsuno, the producer of the game, five months before the game was officially announced. Sakimoto experienced difficulty following in Uematsu's footsteps, but he decided to create a unique soundtrack in his own way, although he cites Uematsu as his biggest musical influence. Sakimoto did not meet with Uematsu for direction on creating the soundtrack and tried to avoid copying Uematsu's style from previous Final Fantasy soundtracks. However, he did attempt to ensure that his style would mesh with Uematsu's \\"Kiss Me Good-Bye\\" and the overall vision of the series. The soundtrack also includes pieces composed by Uematsu for previous Final Fantasy games, with new arrangements by Sakimoto. These tracks include \\"Final Fantasy ~FFXII Version~\\", \\"Victory Fanfare ~FFXII Version~\\", \\"Chocobo FFXII Arrange Ver. 1\\", \\"Chocobo ~FFXII Version~\\", and \\"Clash on the Big Bridge ~FFXII Version~\\". Of these, all but \\"Clash on the Big Bridge\\" are recurring pieces used in almost every Final Fantasy game. \\"Clash on the Big Bridge\\" plays during the battle with Gilgamesh, as it did in Final Fantasy V. Sakimoto created the music for the game based on the atmosphere of the game and the emotional changes of the characters, rather than the story, so that the music would not be affected by changes in the development of the game. Sakimoto stated in an interview included in a bonus disc of the collector's edition of the game that his favorite pieces from the soundtrack are the \\"world\\" themes in the outdoor areas, and that his overall favorite is \\"The Cerobi Steppe\\". Soundtrack Final Fantasy XII Original Soundtrack is the soundtrack album of Final Fantasy XII, containing musical tracks from the game, and was composed and produced by Hitoshi Sakimoto. Additional music was provided by Masaharu Iwata and Hayato Matsuo, who also orchestrated the opening and ending themes. The soundtrack spans four discs and 100 tracks, covering a duration of 4:54:34. It was released on May 31, 2006 in Japan by Aniplex, bearing the catalog numbers SVWC-7351~4. The limited edition of the soundtrack included a 28-page booklet featuring artwork for the game and providing information about the soundtrack. An album entitled Selections from Final Fantasy XII Original Soundtrack was released on October 31, 2006 by Tofu Records containing 31 tracks from the full Final Fantasy XII soundtrack. The tracks were the same versions as on the full soundtrack, although some tracks that repeated were cut shorter. The album covers a duration of 73:23 and has a catalog number of TOF-033. Additionally, a promotional digital album titled The Best of Final Fantasy XII was released on the Japanese localization of iTunes for download only on March 15, 2006. The album contains 11 tracks handpicked by Hitoshi Sakimoto, including versions of \\"Theme of Final Fantasy XII\\" and \\"Chocobo FFXII Arrange Ver. 1\\" that were ultimately not used in the game. The game's soundtrack was nominated for a British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for Best Original Score. Final Fantasy XII Original Soundtrack has sold 31,000 copies as of January 2010. It reached #7 on the Japanese Oricon charts, and stayed on the charts for six weeks. The album received mixed reviews from critics. Jared's review from Square Enix Music Online cited that the soundtrack \\"utilizes ambiance, power, intensity and beauty\\" and termed the album to be \\"amazing\\", though he felt that the lack of melody \\"hurts this soundtrack\\" and that some of the tracks were \\"bare of inspiration\\". Meghan Sullivan of IGN thought that the composer was \\"trying too hard to evoke emotion\\" and that many of the tracks were \\"over-the-top and bombastic\\", though she did feel that there were certain tracks that \\"manage[d] to be stirring\\". She also stated that Uematsu's only work for the soundtrack, \\"Kiss Me Good-bye\\", is a \\"strong end to a surprisingly trite collection\\". Greg Kasavin of GameSpot, on the other hand, felt that it was a \\"beautifully composed soundtrack\\" that sounded \\"fantastic\\". Patrick Gann of RPGFan found it to be \\"a great work\\", but \\"somewhat lacking in substance\\", concluding that he had \\"a lot of mixed feelings about it\\", while Ben Schweitzer of RPGFan disagreed, enjoying the soundtrack and finding it to be an \\"excellent\\" album, and \\"better than [he] could have expected\\". Track list Piano album Piano Collections Final Fantasy XII is an album of piano arrangements of music from the game. The thirteen tracks on the album, totaling 1:01:48 in length, were composed by Sakimoto and arranged and performed by Casey Ormond. The album was released by Square Enix on November 7, 2012 with the catalog number SQEX-10347, and was also published that same day as part of Final Fantasy XII OST & Piano Collections, a pack containing the album and the original soundtrack album with the catalog numbers SQEX-10348~52. A book of sheet music for the album has also been released. Sakimoto originally heard of Ormond due to an arrangement he had made of \\"The Skycity of Bhujerba\\" in 2009, which, after discussion between the two about several other arrangements Ormond made of Sakimoto's work, lead to the two officially working together on Valkyria Chronicles Piano Pieces, an album of piano arrangements for Valkyria Chronicles. The style of arrangements on the Final Fantasy XII album range from classical to a \\"moody piece with plenty of sultry jazz tones\\", one of the two pieces located at the end of the album which Ormond had arranged prior to officially beginning the project. Many of the pieces contain an \\"improvisational\\" sense, even when not technically jazz-based, and several depart notably from the style of the original works. Ormond based many of the changes in theme or mood of his arrangements off of where the pieces were used in the original game, attempting to highlight the perspectives of different characters or ideas from the scenes they were played in. The album was well received by reviewers, with Don Kotowski of Square Enix Music Online calling it one of the best Final Fantasy piano arrangement albums, a claim echoed by Derek Heemsbergen of RPGFan. Heemsbergen added that \\"Ormond shows reverence for Sakimoto's original material while exploring musical ideas in a style all his own\\" and praised the variety of the music. Kotowski praised both the \\"variety of moods\\" covered by the pieces as well as the overall cohesiveness of the album. The Zodiac Age Corresponding with the release of a high- definition remaster of the International Zodiac Job System version of Final Fantasy XII, subtitled The Zodiac Age, Square Enix released an album of music from the game. The 102-track album, released digitally and physically on blu- ray on July 19, 2017, contains new compositions and arrangements of the original tracks by Sakimoto. A limited edition of the album included an additional CD of just the arrangements. Singles Kiss Me Good-Bye Kiss Me Good-Bye is the theme song of Final Fantasy XII, and is the third Japanese single by Angela Aki. The only vocal piece in the game, it was set to tunes composed by Nobuo Uematsu, arranged by Kenichiro Fukui and produced by Motoki Matsuoka. The single was released by Epic Records in Japan on March 15, 2006, covering a duration of 19:59 and bearing the catalog number ESCL-2810. A limited edition was also released bearing the catalog number ESCL-2808 featuring a DVD containing the Kiss Me Good-Bye video clip which included both shots of Aki performing the single and clips from the video game. Unlike previous Final Fantasy games, the theme song is sung in English in both the Japanese and North American versions of the game. The version featured on the CD single has a slightly different arrangement and Japanese lyrics; however, the English version that was featured in the game is included as a bonus track. An English version of the single was released as a digital single on May 16, 2006 under the title Kiss Me Good-Bye [EP] in North America through Tofu Records. \\"Kiss Me Good-bye\\" reached #6 on the Oricon charts and remained on the charts for 18 weeks. The release was seen by critics as an excellent single, with Gann feeling that both the Final Fantasy XII and non-game tracks held their weight equally. Symphonic Poem \\"Hope\\" is a single released by violinist Taro Hakase and is the full version of the game's ending credits music. The piece has been described as a \\"mini-symphony\\" for Final Fantasy XII inspired by the main theme for the game. The single contains five tracks, arranged by Taro Hakase and Yuji Toriyama and produced by Taro Hakase, and features performance by the London Philharmonic Orchestra. A shorter edit blending the first, second and fifth movements of the symphonic poem was used in a promotional video for the game, and appears as a single track in the official soundtrack release. Symphonic Poem \\"Hope\\" was released on March 1, 2006 by Hats Unlimited bearing the catalog number HUCD-10015. Hope was found by critics to be an enjoyable single, though at only 9 minutes long, Gann felt he could have \\"gotten by without it\\", although he said that for other listeners, their \\"collection may not be complete without this little gem\\". Dave of Square Enix Music Online concurred with that sentiment, saying that \\"despite the length of the album, it easily grew on\\" him. \\"Hope\\" reached #15 on the Oricon charts and remained on the charts for 16 weeks. Legacy \\"Kiss Me Good-bye\\" was performed by the Chicagoland Pops Orchestra and Angela Aki for Play! A Video Game Symphony, a worldwide video game music orchestral concert series. The Eminence Symphony Orchestra performed \\"Victory Fanfare\\", \\"Clan Headquarters\\", and \\"Penelo's Theme\\" at the three \\"Passion\\" concerts held in Australia and Singapore in December 2006. \\"Penelo's Theme\\" was again played at the Fantasy Comes Alive concert in Singapore on April 30, 2010. Selections of music from the game also appear on Japanese remix albums, called dojin music, and on English remixing websites.

The Hermitage Theatre was the second theatre of the Winter Palace. It replaced the Russian Imperial Theater, which operated from 1764 until 1783. The Hermitage Theatre was built between 1783 and 1787 at the behest of Catherine the Great to a Palladian design by Giacomo Quarenghi. The crumbling Third Winter Palace of Peter the Great was demolished to make room for the new structure, although its old foundations are still visible in the ground floor. Quarenghi's designs for the theatre were engraved and published in 1787, earning him a European reputation. The semicircular auditorium is decorated with color marble and surrounded with ten niches for statues of Apollo and the muses. As the interior has never been overhauled, the original stage machinery remains in situ, but the elaborate sets, an acclaimed work of the Italian artist Pietro Gonzaga (1751-1831), were lost during the years of Soviet neglect. Hermitage Bridge in front of the theatre The ceremonial opening of the theatre took place on 22 November 1785. Though the auditorium could seat no more than 250 spectators, it was often overcrowded. Usually, the performance would be attended by several dozen aristocratic spectators, all invited by the monarch herself. As a sign of gratitude, a separate loge was reserved for the architect Quarenghi and his family. In the 19th century, selected members of the diplomatic corps were admitted to the theatre as well. Although the building was used to entertain the imperial family until the Russian Revolution, it came to be viewed as a rare monument to Catherine's personal tastes and affections. The empress brought out several comedies specifically to be staged in this theatre, which also saw the premieres of Domenico Cimarosa's operas composed to her own librettos. As for the costumes, they were chosen from a 15,000-dress personal wardrobe of the late Empress Elizabeth. Mathilde Kschessinska, Anna Pavlova, and Fyodor Chaliapin were among the great artists who performed at the Hermitage Theatre for the last Russian tsar. Among the ballets performed there was the premiere of Marius Petipa's Harlequinade, in 1900. The Bolsheviks closed the theatre and utilised the building for administrative purposes. It was not until 1991 that performances were resumed on this stage, with the likes of Svyatoslav Richter, Mstislav Rostropovich and Yelena Obraztsova appearing as guest stars.

It used to be known as Arch Bridge, named for the stone bridge crossing Shickshinny Creek. It served as a logging community until the Battle of Wyoming in 1778, when most of the white settlers fled their homes, fearing Iroquois raids. Several white farmers and loggers returned a few years later to rebuild, including Shadrick Austin, who bought of land and, in 1801, established the Austin Family Inn. Upon the establishment of the post office in 1850 the area was renamed and incorporated as Koonsville after William Koons, who was the first postmaster. The post office was decommissioned at the beginning of World War II, and Koonsville is now serviced by the Shickshinny post office. In 1850 William Koons moved to the area and occupied the Austin family Inn. Koons was survived by B.D. Koons, who was not only a charter member of Shickshinny but also one of the first officers.

He was the first officer to hold the position of Deputy Commissioner as a separate rank and not as an honorary title while also serving as an Assistant Commissioner. Early life and education Trevor Bigham was the third son (although the second surviving) of the judge, John Charles Bigham, 1st Viscount Mersey, and was entitled to the style \\"The Honourable\\" after 1910 due to his father's peerage. He was a King's Scholar at Eton College from 1890 to 1895, and then went up to Magdalen College, Oxford. He took a second in Mods in 1895 and a first in Literae Humaniores in 1899. In 1901, he was called to the Bar by the Middle Temple. On 24 January 1900, he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the 24th (Territorial Force) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment. Police career On 4 December 1909, Bigham was appointed the Chief Constable of the Metropolitan Police Criminal Investigation Department (CID). On 29 January 1914, he succeeded Frederick Bullock as Assistant Commissioner \\"L\\", in charge of the Legal Department of Scotland Yard. During the First World War, he spent most of his time dealing with the control of aliens, and in 1919 he was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). On 6 November 1922, Bigham and his colleague, Assistant Commissioner Frank Elliott, were sent a box of chocolate √©clairs poisoned with arsenic. Luckily, they were suspicious and did not eat them, and Walter Tatam, who had a history of mental problems, was later found guilty of attempted murder. In 1928, he became Assistant Commissioner \\"C\\", in charge of CID. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the Metropolitan Police Centenary Honours of 3 June 1929. Following the sudden death of Sir Charles Royds on 5 January 1931, Bigham succeeded him as Assistant Commissioner \\"A\\", in charge of administration and uniformed operations and with the courtesy title of Deputy Commissioner. He also immediately became Acting Commissioner, as Lord Byng was absent on medical leave in France. Shortly afterwards, following a reorganisation, he became solely Deputy Commissioner, being succeeded as Assistant Commissioner \\"A\\" by Lieutenant-Colonel David Allan. Bigham retired in January 1935. Family Bigham married, at Temple Church, London, on 17 December 1901, Frances Leonora Tomlin, daughter of J. L. Tomlin. They had two daughters.

Their language is one of the few on Timor which is not an Austronesian language, but rather a Papuan language, belonging to the Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea linguistic family. They are surrounded by groups which speak Malayo-Polynesian languages, like the Atoni and the Tetum. According to Languages of the World (Voegelin and Voegelin, 1977), there were about 100,000 speakers of the language, split evenly between the two nations. Settlement area Today's settlement area of the Bunak people is located in the mountains of central Timor, ranging from the East Timorese town of Maliana in the north to the Timor Sea in the south, where both the Bunak and the Tetun communities often live side by side in coexistence. The Bunak people are isolated linguistically and socially, since the adjacent Kemak people to the north, the Mambai people in the east, the Tetun people in the south and west and the Atoni people speak to the west speak Malayo-Polynesian languages. Bunak is considered as being one of the Papuan languages, even though there are strong influences from the neighboring languages. The other Timorese Papuan languages are spoken in the east of Timor. Because of the language diversity in the region, the Bunak people are able to speak at least one of the Malayo- Polynesian languages fluently (in East Timor, Tetum is the lingua franca), while their surrounding neighbors rarely learn the Bunak language. In the hard-to-reach mountains, the townships of the Bunak people are relatively isolated from their neighboring communities. In East Timor, their area expands to the west of Manufahi District and in West Timor (Indonesia) towards the east of the Belu Regency and Malaka Regency. The Bunak people of East Timor live mainly in places like Bobonaro and Lolotoe in the town of Bobonaro District, Tilomar Subdistrict and Zumalai in the municipality of Cova Lima District, Cassa in the municipality of Ainaro District, and Betano and Same in the municipality of Manufahi District. In the western border area of Cova Lima District, the Bunak people form a minority among the Tetun people. However, many townships are mixed. Between Fohoren and the coast south of Suai mixed townships of Tetun and Bunak people are found. A total of 55,837 East Timorese speak the Bunak language as their native language. In the eastern regions of West Timor, the Bunak people in Belu Regency form the majority in Lamaknen and South Lamaknen districts, and a minority in Riahat district in the southeast. Similarly, in the southeast of West Timor, the Tetun people form the majority. Individual Bunak settlements can be found among Tetun villages in the Rai Manuk district of Belu Regency, Kobalima, East Kobalima and East Malaka district of Malaka Regency. The westernmost Bunak settlements are Haroeh (Sanleo Administrative village, East Malaka district) and Welaus (North Lakekun Administrative village, Kobalima district). In the northwest are the isolated Bunak villages of Faturika, Renrua (both in Rai Manuk district) and Babulu (Kobalima district). To the east Bunak townships lie along the road to the Alas and South Alas Administrative village of East Kobalima district at the border with East Timor. History and expansion Mythical origins According to legend, there was once a man named Mau Ipi Guloq who first domesticated the water buffalo. Together with his brother Asa Pharan, he one day caught two sows, which turned into women. His brother, however, claimed both women for himself, which eventually led Mau Ipi Guloq to part with him after a fight. One day a crow disturbed his buffalo, and so Mau Ipi Guloq shot a golden arrow at the bird with a golden blowpipe that he had borrowed from his brother. The crow flew with the arrow and Mau Ipi Guloq followed her into the underworld, where he met her sick ruler. Mau Ipi Guloq offered his help and discovered that his golden arrow was stuck in the ruler. He exchanged it with a bamboo arrow, which he soaked in his betel pouch. The ruler of the underworld was restored to health and gave Mau Ipi Guloq two oranges from a tree in the Underworld that turned into princesses. Asa Pharan asked his brother to exchange one of his wives for one of the princesses. But when he refused, Asan Paran threw Mau Ipi Guloq into a ravine and killed him. However, Mau Ipi Guloq's wives found him and brought him back to life by using an oil from the Underworld. He returned home healthy and brought back to his youth again; his brother also asked for a bath in the oil in order to be young again. Mau Ipi Guloq's wives heated the oil bath so much that Asa Pharan was scalded and died. Mau Ipi Guloq also married his brother's wives and became one of the main ancestors of the Bunak people. Overview Just as with any other Timorese ethnic group, there was originally no written tradition. All history and traditions were passed in by word of mouth until the coming of European colonization. Rich traditions do exist among the Timorese, especially the Bunak people. These narrative traditions are recited with repetition, rhyme and alliteration. This helps the performer remember the verses. In general, it is assumed that Melanesians migrated to Timor around 3000 BC, to be partially displaced by later Proto-Malayo-Polynesian groups from 2500 BC. Some claim that the Fataluku people might have reached Timor from the east only after the Austronesians and that they were repressed or assimilated. There has been speculation of such a scenario even with the Makasae language. In the case of the Bunak people, however, there are only place names of Papuan linguistic origin in the homeland country, thus the Bunak people must have settled here before the Austronesians. Moreover, as the Bunak people have common non-Austronesian vocabulary with the Fataluku language, Makasae language and Makalero language, the existence of a Proto-Timor-Papuan language, from which all the Papuan languages of Timor originate, had been postulated. The present area of the Bunak people is the result of different migrations. Due to population growth, the Bunak people were forced to expand again and again to find new arable land. External influences also led to groups having to flee as well as forced resettlement. Portuguese colonization began on Timor Island in the 16th century, while in the middle of the 18th century the Dutch extended their influence into the area of the Bunak people, so that it was divided into two sections, comprising a Western Dutch and an Eastern Portuguese sphere of interest. However, European rule remained predominantly nominal, with rule exercised by local traditional rulers. It was only in the early 20th century that the two colonial powers succeeded in building up a real colonial administration. In the Second World War the Japanese occupied Timor from 1942 to 1945, ruling it as a single entity. There was fighting with Australian guerrilla commandos, with the aid of some Portuguese as well as many Timorese. After the war, the west became part of Indonesia, while the east remained a Portuguese colony until 1975. When the Portuguese departed from Timor, the Indonesians first occupied the border region of East Timor. Nine days after the declaration of the Independence of East Timor, a full invasion followed, and a 24 year long struggle for independence. The civilian population fled the invasion into the wilderness, to only later have to gradually surrender to the invaders; it was not until 1979 that the last of the Bunak people living in the forests were forced to capitulate. It was not until 1999 that Indonesia withdrew, and after three years of administration by the United Nations in East Timor did East Timir finally regain independence. however, the Bunak people and their homeland continued to be divided by the colonial border. Since independence, more and more people from rural areas have moved to the capital, Dili, including many of the Bunak people. Many took up residence according to their geographical origin. Bunak speakers live in the west of the city in Comoro, Fatuhada and Bairro Pite, as well as in the city center in Suco Gricenfor, Acadiru Hun, Suco Santa Cruz and Suco Lahane Oriental. In 2006 there was unrest in the county, started mainly by East Timorese from Firaku and Kaladi. Bunak people belonging to the Kaladi were also involved in the conflict. In Dili, for example, there was confrontation between the Bunak people from Bobonaro District and Ermera District and Makasae people from Baucau District and Viqueque District for dominance in the market place. Heartland A Company of Moradores parade in Bobonaro, circa 1968-1970. The heartland of the Bunak is located in the middle east of the East Timorese area of Bobonaro and north east of the municipality of Cova Lima District. Here is the only place where place names of Bunak origin are to be found, while in other areas inhabited by the Bunak there are also place names of Austronesian origin. Bunak settlements in bordering territories only have Austronesian place names. This indicates that the original homeland of the Bunak people lies in the center of the territory where the Bunak now cover. In the Bunak language there are influences from Kemak and somewhat less from Mambai. From this we can conclude that the Bunak also had contact with the Mambai people and Kemak people in the past. In the northeast, the Bunak people refer to themselves and their language as Gaiq or Gaeq, which is likely to derived from Mgai; the Kemak name for the Bunak people. According to Bunak oral traditions, they formerly belonged to the former kingdom of Likusa (Likosa), which once existed in the region of the Tokodede and Kemak people, which explains the adoption of anAustronesian name of the Bunak people. as well as the strong linguistic influence of the Kemak language on the Bunak language. In Marobo (Atsabe Administrative Post) and Suco Obulo, the Kemak people intermingled with the Bunak people, leading to cultural differences between the Kemak people on this side compared to the neighbouring Kemak people of Atsabe. Between Maliana, Lamaknen and Maucatar According to Bunak folk history in the northwest, they originally migrated from the east to the region south of Maliana and the present Indonesian districts of Lamaknen and Raihat. There they mingled peacefully with the local peoples, these being, according to source, the local Tetun or Atoin Meto people. The existing village names of Austronesian origin support these accounts. Legends of the Bunak people from the upper Lamaknen district, however, report that their forefathers had either expelled or killed the Melus (Timor) people when they came into the region. Research so far has not clarified whether the Melus were Tetun, Atoin Meto or another people. Investigations of the Bunak dialects suggest that the Bunak from the northeast and southwest met and settled in Lamaknen district. According to oral tradition, the region around Lamaknen district was an autonomous region of the Wehali Tetun people, bordering on the kingdom of Likusa. This influence can still be seen today as the Lamaknen dialect uses loanwords for ritual formulations from Tetum language. In 1860 the region around Maucatar became a Dutch enclave, while the surrounding area was claimed by Portugal. The borders of the enclave coincided with the borders of the local Bunak kingdoms. The area now belongs to the Sucos of Holpilat, Taroman, Fatululic, Dato Tolu and Lactos. The territory of the then enclave of Maucatar is still inhabited by a large majority of Bunak. However, there are also Tetun place names. Therefore it is assumed that the Bunak immigrated to this region and largely replaced the local Tetun, who today form a small minority. In 1897 there were several battles around Lamaknen District areas between the northeastern kingdom of Lamaquitos (Lamakhitu) and the southern Lakmaras kingdom, which had as coalition partners the Bunak in the southwest. The end of this last traditional conflict between the indigenous kingdoms of the region has meant that the Bunak people in Lamaknen district have since gradually left their fortified villages on high ground and built houses close to water supplies. Spread out over a larger area, the clan members now only come to their clan houses to perform ceremonies. As a result of the various territorial shifts between the Bunak kingdoms, however, the border between the two colonial powers of Portugal and the Netherlands remained a long-standing issue and was the subject of lengthy negotiations. In Lakmaras District, there were several deaths in the same year in clashes between Dutch and Portuguese troops. The Dutch claim to Maucatar was justified by Lakmaras sovereignty, which created a link to Maucatar. Meanwhile, Lakmaras had become subject to the kingdom of Lamaquitos, and this was part of the Portuguese sphere of power established by the Treaty of Lisbon in 1859. Maucatar would have failed as an Portugal enclave, according to the agreements that were already in place. On the other hand, the state of Tahakay (Tahakai, Tafakay, Takay; now in southern Lamaknen district) belonging to Portugal had subsequently become part of Lamaknen district. Tahakay, however, belonged to the Portuguese sphere of influence, while Lamaknen district belonged to the Dutch. Portugal opposed this loss in the negotiations of 1902, and therefore demanded the entire Dutch territories in the center of Timor. A compromise was reached with The Hague Convention of October 1, 1904: Portugal was to receive Maucatar, in exchange for the Portuguese enclave Noimuti in West Timor, and the border areas of Tahakay, Tamira Ailala and Tamiru Ailala of Lamaknen District. Portugal respected the treaty until 1909, but then there was a dispute over the border crossing on the eastern border of Oecusse District. In 1910, the Netherlands took advantage of the overthrow of the Portuguese monarchy in order to regain Lakmaras with the help of European and Javanese troops. Map series referring to the PCA Award from 25 June 1914 belonging to the boundaries in the island of Timor. In February 1911, following the 1904 Convention, Portugal tried to occupy Maucatar. However, in June, it faced a superior Dutch armed force from the Ambonese infantry, supported by European soldiers. On June 11, Portuguese troops occupied the territory of Lakmaras, but on July 18, Dutch and Javanese troops regained it. After the Dutch victory, the Portuguese then sought a peaceful agreement. They soon fell into trouble with a rebellion in the Manufahi District, which brought them to the negotiating table. On August 17, 1916, a treaty was signed in The Hague, which largely defined the borders between East and West Timor. On 21 November the agreed areas were exchanged. Noimuti, Maubisse, Tahakay and Taffliroe fell to the Netherlands, and Maucatar to Portugal, causing panic. Before the transfer to the Portuguese, 5,000 locals, mostly Bunaks, destroyed their fields and moved to West Timor. The population in Tamira Ailala would rather have stayed with Portugal, while in Tahakay the Dutch were welcomed. It was only a few generations ago that Bunak established villages in the lowlands around Maliana, such as Tapo-Memo. Even today these villages still retain ritual relations with their native villages in the highlands. After the Second World War, Bunak people from Lebos fled from the then Portuguese Timor to Lamaknen district. They were afraid of reprisals after collaborating with the Japanese during the Battle of Timor. The then ruler of Lamaknen, the Loroh (king) Alfonsus Andreas Bere Tallo, welcomed the arrival of the refugees, who founded the village of Lakus (in today's Desa Kewar). As a result of the civil war between Augustine and UDT, refugees from East Timorese villages came to the border from August 1975 onwards. Among them were many Bunak people. They came from Odomau, Holpilat, Lela, Aitoun, Holsa, Memo and Raifun. At the end of August, the conflict crossed over to the other side of the border. Villages were destroyed, such as Henes in the Desa on the west side of the same name, which has not been rebuilt. The invasion of East Timor by Indonesia, which took place later in the following months, also caused more Bunak people to flee from their villages to escape the invasion. Some crossed the border, others sought shelter in the forests, where some of the people spent up to three years in hiding. Village communities were thus torn apart and resettled in different places until 1999. A similar fate befell the village of Abis in Lamaknen District. Although the inhabitants returned to their village after their escape in 1975, the village was burned down near the East Timor border. In 1999, other refugees also came to Lamaknen district from East Timor after the independence of East Timor and remain there to this day. There was fighting with the locals and in the process fields, huts and streets were destroyed. Southwest of Cova Lima Man in Fatuc Laran, Lactos, Cova Lima District, East Timor, 2009. Recently, Bunak people migrated to the southwest of Cova Lima District in two independent waves. The earlier group lives in slightly higher areas of Suco Beiseuc (formerly known as Foholulik, 2010: 30% Bunak) and Suco Lalawa (35% Bunak). They came in a large stream of refugees from the community of Bobonaro, when they fled in the Second World War before the arrival of the Japanese army. Guerrilla units of the Allies had operated against the Japanese of Lolotoe and the village of Bobonaro, and the Japanese troops carried out reprisals against the civilian population in Bobonaro in August 1942. This probably cost several tens of thousands of people their lives and drove others to flee. The second wave are those Bunak people who settled in the lowlands between Suai and the border. They were forcibly resettled from northern Sucos in the Cova Lima District, such as Fatululic and Taroman, by the Indonesian occupation forces. The official reason was a development program for rice cultivation. However, in 1977, many East Timor peoples were forcibly removed from remote areas in order to cut support for Fretilin. The Indonesian army in East Timor set up so-called \\"Internment Camps\\", in which hundreds of thousands of civilians were interred. Malaka and southern Belu The Bunak of Namfalus village (Desa Rainawe, Kobalima District) originated in the same exodus of Bunak people in South Fohorem before the arrival of Japanese troops in the Second World War. Other Bunak people in this region are the descendants of the 5,000 refugees from Maucatar, who left the former Dutch enclave after the takeover by the Portuguese. The more recent Bunak people joined these villagers when they fled in 1975 and in 1999 when the violence in East Timor broke out. The resettlement of the Maucatar Bunak people led to controversy with the local Tetun people, causing the Bunak to shift repeatedly. It was only in the 1930s that the administration succeeded in settling the refugees at their present places of residence. The Bunak people in these areas still trace their origin to certain places in Maucatar, such as those from Raakfao (Raakafau, Desa Babulu) in Fatuloro and those from Sukabesikun (Desa Litamali, Kobalima District) in Suco Belecasac. Despite the threat of assimilation to the neighboring Tetun people, they are still able to trace their origins. Eastern Cova Lima The Bunak settlements from Suai to Zumalai were also established only recently. The area was previously uninhabited. These relatively recent settlements also have connections to their places of origin. Thus, Beco village has a deep relationship with Teda village, east of Lolotoe, even though the migration was a few generations ago. Their dialect is close to that of the Lolotoe region, even if some of their vocabulary was taken from the southwestern dialect. Other settlements emerged only during the Indonesian occupation when all villages from the north along the southern coastal road around Zumalai were resettled. Their dialect is a Highlands dialect. Ainaro and Manufahi Holy House in Maununo, Suco Cassa, Ainaro Subdistrict, Ainaro District, East Timor. Bunak people live among the Mambai people in the south of Ainaro District and in the south-west of Manufahi District. Speakers of the Bunak language in these districts recognize their origin from the north-eastern Bunak region. Through the close contact with the Mambai people, most of the Bunak people are bilingual in Mambai, which is a Malayo-Polynesian language; their language also shows influence from Mambai. Maununo was a suco that consisted of only three villages during the Indonesian occupation. The population of Maununo is 60% Tetun, 30% Bunak and 10% Mambai. In Suco Cassa the Bunak people form 55% of the population, followed by the Tetun and a small minority of Mambai. Even in Fohoailiku the Bunak people represent the majority. According to oral traditions, the Bunak people of Fahoailiku originated from western Ainaro, which they left due to conflicts with other Bunak groups during the Portuguese colonial period. The linguistic characteristics of the three Bunak groups in Ainaro suggest a common origin. There are accounts of their origin that are conflicting. While parts of the Bunak stated that they had only entered the region later, others claimed that they were the original inhabitants. However, all Bunak settlements have Australian names, which would indicate an originally Malayo-Polynesian peoples settlement. So are places with names that begin with Mau (Mau Nuno, Mau-Ulo, Maubisse); that is typical of settlement areas inhabited by the Mambai people, Kemak people and Tocodede people. In the heartland of the Bunak people, such naming does not occur. Other places with names that are clearly of Mambai origin, such as Suco Beikala, which means bei \\"grandparents\\" and kala \\"ancestors\\". In addition to the three main groups of the Bunak people in Ainaro, there are two other smaller groups, which were moved from the region around Zumalai only during the Indonesian occupation. The first group lives in the villages of Civil (Sivil) and Lailima (both in Suco Cassa). The second group from the east of Suco Casa are two Bunak villages, Leolima and Hutseo (along with its subsequent offspring, Hutseo 2 village) are surrounded by vast Mambai settlements. The inhabitants of these four villages speak the northeast dialect, with the variations typical of Zumalai. In Manufahi District there are four isolated Bunak villages. The oldest of them is Loti (Lotin) in the southeast of Suco Daisula. The Bunak people emigrated here from Suco Aiasa in 1891, after a conflict with the ruler of Bobonaro. According to oral traditions, the inhabitants of Suco Aiasa had killed the ruler's wife, whereupon Bobonaro requested assistance from the Portuguese in August 1891. After several battles some of the inhabitants of Suco Aiasa fled to Manufahi. They first settled somewhat further north of today's Loti, where they had only contact with Mambai people and Lakalei speakers. This resulted in a unique deviation and even change in meaning in the local Bunak dialect. After the failed rebellion of Manufahi, a part of the Bunak people of Loti was moved by the Portuguese to the location of today's Loti. Others were settled in two new villages in Suco Betano. One of them is Bemetan as it is known in Mambai language or Il Guzu (meaning \\"black water\\") in Bunak language, and the second being Leoai (Leo Ai / Leouai). During the Indonesian occupation, Bunak people who remained in the old Loti was also relocated to the new Loti. These three villages share their own extraordinary dialect. The fourth Bunak village in Manufahi is Sessurai (Sesurai) in Suco Betano, on the road between Loti and Leoai. According to their traditions, these Bunak people fled from the region around Zumalai to Manufahi during the Portuguese colonial period. Their dialect corresponds to that from Zumalai, but has taken over some words from the Bunak people of Loti. Culture Social organization A woman weaving in Fatuc Laran, Lactos, Cova Lima District, East Timor. The social isolation has also been reinforced part of the reputation of Bunak people. They have been described as rough and aggressive by their neighbors. This characterization can also be found in a Bunak legend, in which Kemak people have long ears and the Bunak people have small ears. The metaphorical length of the ears in the Bunak people points to a short-tempered and impatient temperament, while the Kemak people are described as calm and patient. Although Bunak and Atoin Meto people differ culturally, the social organization and the ecology of both cultures belong in the same context where both the cultures of Atoin Meto and Bunak people benefit from each other. The approach of the Bunak people from a cultural and linguistic point of view is so far that Louis Berthe described it in 1963 as a mixture of Papuans and Austronesian roots. The smallest social unit in the Bunak society is the clan or the house, which for example, in the upper Lamaknen is called deu. Several clans live together in villages (tas). Each village has its own territory. The clans have a different status. The clans of the nobles are called sisal tul (meaning, bones piece). The name derives from a ritual in which the bones of an animal that was sacrificed belonging to the noble clan. The highest of the nobility houses belong to the clan of the \\"feminine\\" chieftain. This man decides in case of problems in the village. The second highest clan represents the \\"masculine\\" chieftain who takes care of the village's relations with the outside world. Other clans are the consultants of the village chefs. Despite their extensive power (), the two chiefs are subordinate to the ritual chief. This has a limited power () within the affairs of the clan. Together with one of his sisters, the ritual chief is also the guardian of the holy objects in the clan house. In Lamaknen the siblings are called \\"the man holding the black basket\\" () and the \\"woman holding the black basket\\" (). The different clans are connected to each other in the system of the malu ai. The malu clan are in this case in a partnership, the woman and feminine goods such as pigs and clothes, while from the ai baqa, clan receive wives and give masculine goods. This used to include gold, silver and water buffalo, now replaced by money and cattle. On ceremonial occasions, such as funerals or of the clan house repair, goods between are again malu and ai baqa replaced. However, women rarely leave their clan. In the majority of the Bunak family, a matrilineal system prevails for the succession. The man traditionally moves into the clan of the bride (Matrilocality), where the later children also grow up. The husband has to provide as a mane pou (\\"new man\\") his children and wife, but is not considered a family member. He also has no claims or rights over his wife and children, even if he had to pay a high bride price. In 1991 this was about US dollars 5,100. If the wife dies first, the widower must leave the village and even his own children, and return to his old home village. This may also be necessary through certain ceremonies. He is not allowed to take any valuable property, therefore he is dependent on the help of his clan and his family. He also does not receive the support from his own children as a clan. When the woman moves into an ai baqa clan, one speaks of the clipping of the woman from her clan. She is admitted to her husband's clan, where the family forms a new line of lineage (dil), establishing a new malu - ai baqa relationship. The children also belong to the clan of the father. Clans can maintain as much as fifteen malu relationships but there can never be more than three to six dil. They maintain their status in the further course of the mother line. The members of the dil lead the name of the maternal clan and keep their property and their sacred objects. In Ainaro, however, the influence of neighboring Mambai people has led to a patrilineal structure. Also here the Mambai and Bunak people share a common legend. Thus, the Bunak people from Mau-Nuno derive from the same mythical ancestral couple and the summit of the mountain from which they are derived has both a Bunak and a Mambai name. In a Holy House (Uma Lulik) in Fatuc Laran, Lactos, Cova Lima District, East Timor. Holy objects are handed down by the men to his uterine nephew. In any case of the marriage type, the father can only pass on to the son the objects which he has acquired in the course of his life. Other holy objects belong to the entire clan. They are generally regarded as sources of life energy. They are kept in the clan houses, where only the guardians reside. Previously, all clan members lived together in single lineage or clan house. Sometimes, the guardians still have a young couple who would help them with the daily work. Every clan house has an altar that can be found both inside and outside the house. In the house is the altar on one of the two piles which carry the first beam (lor bul). Across the street is the fireplace. On the common altar of the village (bosok o op, meaning \\"altar and height\\") are aligned to all the clan houses' lor bul. The village altar () represents the vital energy of the inhabitants. It is also called '; meaning \\"root of women, leaves of men\\", a metaphor for vitality where leaves move and roots allow plants to absorb water. The longer the roots, the longer the plant lives. Bunak people wishes each other a long life by saying (meaning \\"Let our roots be long\\") or (meaning \\"Let our roots be cool\\"). Cooling, in conjunction with water, symbolizes fertility; Heat is associated with danger and death. Other altars can be located at water sources, others were only used in the event of war. Agricultural rites in Lamaknen Rice fields in the subdistrict of Maliana, East Timor. According to legend, when the Bunak people reached Lamaknen, they asked their ancestors in heaven for seeds so that they could work the land. On a field altar, Bei Suri; a man who had joined the Bunak people, was sacrificed and burned. Various parts of his body then appeared on the different plantations that the Bunak people had planted. Several traditional prose describes how various crops such as rice; which still the ceremonial food, were provided by parts of the hero's body. However, there are also versions that incorporate the corn into the legend, which today is the main food source of the Bunak people in Lamaknen. But this was only brought to Timor by the Europeans. The rain is also linked to the self-sacrifice of Bei Suri. After his death, he asked people not to cry anymore, and took the form of a bird that predicts the rain. The researcher Claudine Friedberg explored the rituals of the Bunak people in Abis (Lamaknen) during the 1970s to the early 1980s and described in detail the ceremonies of the Bunak people in this region. However, the place no longer exists and a road now connects the region with the outside world, which previously could only be reached with horses at that time. Agriculture here is entirely dependent on the amount of monsoon that occurs. The reliability of sufficient rainfall is the critical moment of the agricultural calendar during the sowing season. It takes place in Lamaknen before the rain comes between October and December. The fields are prepared by means of slash-and-burn. Then the 'Lord of the Seeds' and the 'Rice Masters' lay down the dates for numerous ceremonies. The 'Lord of the Seeds' belongs to the clan to whom the legend is attributed to the sacrifice of Bei Suri. It is, however, none of the nobility houses. On the other hand, 'Rice Masters' are the guardians of the holy objects of certain, distinguished clans. Before the sowing, a hunting takes place several days, in which the men usually take wild pigs. In the remaining time of the year, they will no longer hunt like they did. Wild game has become rare with the increase of population growth, so they beat around the countryside to prevent possible damage of their fields by wild animals. The prey is associated with the kukun, \\"the obscure ones\\". This refers to the local spirits of the deceased Melus who were once expelled by the Bunak people from the region. The kukun are the masters of heaven and earth (pan o muk gomo) and the masters of the prey. On the contrary, the living are the roman, the \\"clear ones\\". For the kukun there are small, inconspicuous altars from only a few stones in the surroundings that are scattered. About these muk kukun (\\"earth obscure\\") are the sites where the Bunak people make contact with the kukun spirits. The main altar stands near the village. In the evening of the first day of the hunt, the 'Lord of the Seeds' puts a liana around the wide cairn and binds its ends to two wooden stakes standing a few centimeters apart. The liana symbolizes the circling of the pigs, which can only flee through a narrow gate where the hunters are waiting for them. On the following day, the Rice Masters sacrifice some betel nuts, some alcohol and feathers of a live chicken, to the muk kukun; which is in the selected hunting area, so that the 'Master of the Land' would surrender the wild pigs. At the same time, the 'Rice Masters' lie down in front of the altar and deceive themselves to sleep, so that the pigs are also to fall into a deep sleep. This makes it easier for the hounds to chase them. The booty of the first hunting day is brought back to the village in the evening, where a woman from the clan of the 'Lord of the Seeds' welcomes with betel just as one welcomes a guest. It is followed by \\"Welcome to the Smoke of Fire\\" (hoto boto hoso) ritual. The 'Lord of the Seeds', and the 'Rice Master' recite verses in reference to the seeds that were entrusted by the corpse of Bei Suri. One of the 'Master of the Word' sacrifices a cock with red feathers by killing him. The throat is not cut with a knife as it is usually done, to prevent severing ties with the \\"seed\\". The 'Lord of the Word' recites a welcome text and prays to the 'lord of the village altar'. This title refers to the Melus, who had originally erected the altar, and the first Bunak man who took it over. From the appendages of the cock is used predict about the upcoming planting season. The boiled cock is dissected and spread over small baskets of cooked rice. Some of them are offered to the altar and placed on its top. Then they are handed over to the clan of the female chief. Those baskets at the foot of the altar go to the Sabaq Dato, the clan of the \\"feminine chief\\" of the Melus. A basket is sacrificed at Bei Suri. This is the 'Lord of the Seeds'. The other baskets are distributed among the hunters. On the third day of the hunt at night, the 'Lord of the Seeds' and the 'Rice Masters' bring the meat; which according to their belief contains the seeds of the future harvest, to the lataq altar at the edge of the village. This is done in silence, so as not to attract attention in carnivores. On the lataq, birds, insects and other animals are symbolically fed with rice and chicken to keep them away. In the afternoon of the third day, the various clans visit their graves and bring them fruits and special cakes. At the graves they meet with members of the respective malu clans that also bring fruits and cakes. After being presented to the deceased, the gifts are given to the ai baqa clan. On the fourth day, after the last hunt, one last common ritual is performed. Women from all clans of the village bring in large baskets of cooked rice to the 'Lord of the Seeds' at the lataq altar. This is distributed to the hunters who have injured or killed a pig. It is a kind of compensation, because, contrary to the customary custom, they do not receive any part of the prey from this traditional hunting. The meat is consumed only by the 'Lord of the Seeds' and the rulers within the ritual circle. Exactly at this time the first heavy rain is expected to fall. It is in the experience of ritual leaders that the ritual and rain coincide on the same day and thus marks the success of the harvest. Every three years, the final ritual is even more complex. This period coincides with the three-year rhythm of the slash-and-burn. From the next day, the fields are sown after a piglet and a goat have been slaughtered at the respective field altar. The blood of the piglet is said to be cold and also to cool down the seeds. Coldness is a synonym for fertility for the Bunak people, while combining heat with death, danger, and struggle. The goat is said to carry the souls (melo) of the fallen trees to the hereafter on the top of their horns. Friedberg, however, noted in 1989 after a visit to the region that this ritual was no longer carried out at the field altars. The reason was that there was simply no one to sacrifice. Instead, a common cooling-down ritual of all village villagers was held at the village altar. The ritual for the souls of the trees was omitted, possibly because there was simply no more trees in the fields due to the short frequency of the slash-and-burns. Seeds are being sown on the fields after it is directly slash-and-burned without being worked on. The digging-stick (nut) has an eight to ten centimeter large metal blade and it also the same tool used for weeding. Irrigated fields did not exist in Abis village, but in other parts of Lamaknen. These irrigation are prepared with the help of water buffaloes and cattle. As long as the crops are not ripe, there are strict harvest prohibitions from kapitan and those supporting him, (meaning \\"to hear to see\\") are monitored. The kapitan himself is subordinate to the 'Master of the Firstfruits' (), also known as the 'Master of the Germs, the Sandalwood and the Beeswax' (). Sandalwood and beeswax were formerly important commodities whose production was under the control of the local rulers who protect the stocks. The Tobe (customary ritual leader with authority over land, forests, and water) of Atoin Meto people in Oecusse District also has a similar function as a resource manager. Kapitan and 'Master of the Firstfruits' came from the same clan, the house Sabaq Dato, at the Bunak people in Abis village. Mangoes and candlenut are the first to become ripe. The entire harvest of both fruits is collected on the main square of the village. The clans of the male and female chieftains are the first to get their share of the mangoes, which is also larger than that of the others. Only the female chief receives a share of the candlenut. The rest is kept by the kapitan for general use.

He died in Lahore jail after a 63-day hunger strike. Early life Jatindra Das was born in 1904 at Calcutta. He joined the Anushilan Samiti, a revolutionary group in Bengal, at a young age and also participated in Gandhi's Non-Cooperation movement in 1921. He was a bright student and passed the Matriculation and Intermediate examinations in the First Division. He joined the Anushilan Samiti, a revolutionary group in Bengal, and also participated in Mahatma Gandhi's Non-Cooperation movement in 1921, at the tender age of just 17. In November 1925, while studying for a B.A. at Bangabasi College in Calcutta, Das was arrested for his political activities and was imprisoned at the Mymensingh Central Jail. While interned there, he went on a hunger strike to protest the ill-treatment meted out to the political prisoners. After fasting for twenty days, the Jail Superintendent apologised and he gave up the fast. He was contacted by revolutionaries in other parts of India and agreed to participate in bomb-making for Bhagat Singh and comrades. Sachindra Nath Sanyal taught him how to make bombs. On 14 June 1929 he was arrested for revolutionary activities and was imprisoned in Lahore jail to be tried under the supplementary Lahore Conspiracy Case. Hunger strike In Lahore jail, Das began a hunger strike along with other revolutionary fighters, demanding equality for Indian political prisoners with those from Europe. The conditions of Indian inhabitants of the jails was deplorable. The uniforms that Indian prisoners were required to wear in jail with were not washed for several days, and rats and cockroaches roamed the kitchen area making the food unsafe to eat. Indian prisoners were not provided with any reading material such as newspapers, nor paper to write on. The condition of the British prisoners in the same jail was strikingly different. Das's hunger strike started on 13 July 1929 and lasted 63 days. The jail authority took measures to forcibly feed him and the other independence activist. Eventually, the jail committee recommended his unconditional release, but the government rejected the suggestion and offered to release him on bail. Jatin died on 13 September 1929.Indian Post article Durga Bhabhi led the funeral procession, which went from Lahore to Calcutta by train. Thousands of people rushed to the railway stations to pay homage to Das. A two-mile long procession in Calcutta carried the coffin to the cremation ground. It was Subhash Chandra Bose, who received the coffin of Das at Howrah Railway Station and led the funeral procession to the cremation ground. The hunger strike of Jatin Das in prison was one crucial moment in the resistance against illegal detentions. Das on a 1979 stamp of India After his death, the Viceroy informed London that \\"Mr Das of the Conspiracy Case, who was on hunger strike, died this afternoon at 1 p.m. Last night, five of the hunger strikers gave up their hunger strike. So there are only Bhagat Singh and Dutt who are on strike.\\" Tributes were paid by almost every leader in the country. Mohammad Alam and Gopi Chand Bhargava resigned from the Punjab Legislative Council in protest. Motilal Nehru proposed the adjournment of the Central Assembly as a censure against the inhumanity of the Lahore prisoners. The censure motion was carried by 55 votes against 47. Jawaharlal Nehru said \\"Another name has been added to the long and splendid roll of Indian martyrs. Let us bow our heads and pray for strength to act to carry on the struggle, however long it may be and whatever consequences, till the victory is ours \\". Subhas Chandra Bose described Das as the \\"young Dadhichee of India\\", referring to the well known mythological yogi Dadhichee who sacrificed his life for the sake of killing a demon. Popular culture In the 2002 film The Legend of Bhagat Singh, the character of Jatin Das was played by Amitabh Bhattacharjee.Amitabh Bhattacharjee.

It is owned by Cumulus Media. The station's studios are located in Little Rock off Chenal Parkway, and the transmitter tower is located on Shinall Mountain, near the Chenal Valley neighborhood of Little Rock. KURB is the area's continual top performer for women listenership. The station's current lineup includes mornings with Kevin Idol and Robyn Cisar; mid-days with Randy Cain; and afternoon drive with Becky Rogers. The station features John Tesh with \\"Intelligence for your Life\\", Sunday through Friday nights at 7pm, and the Best of Tesh on Saturday mornings from 7am to 10am. The station also has a positive reputation in the community with its involvement with charitable organizations, most notably Arkansas Children's Hospital where more than $2.5 million has been raised through a very successful annual fundraising effort. The station won the \\"Ken Peterson Founder's Award for Station of the Year\\" in 2008 for its work with ACH. B98.5 was competing against stations in the US, UK and Canada. Personalities who have previously worked at KURB include Little Rock radio icon Craig O'Neill, who left the station in 2000 for a position in local television. He now anchors evening newscasts for Little Rock's CBS-TV affiliate, KTHV. Jeff Matthews, now with Conway Corp, and long-time local TV host and radio personality, Lisa Fischer. History The station signed on with call letters now on a CHR in Hot Springs, KLAZ. KLAZ 98 began like many FMs in the early 1970s, with a progressive \\"underground\\" format. It adopted the top-40 format in the late 1970s and benefited from the increasing popularity of FM radio and being one of the first FMs in the market doing the format. Although it changed calls to KZOU and became Zoo 98 in the mid-80's, it was wildly successful and ran original sister station KAAY out of the format. Zoo 98 was also the only station to beat KSSN in the first 10 years of its existence. It mopped the floor with top-40 competitor KKYK, though it would eventually fall to KKYK after a series of missteps, including letting popular morning man Craig O'Neill leave for KKYK, and an ownership change at KKYK that took the station and its format more seriously. Despite being overtaken by KKYK in '89, KZOU would continue to be a top-5 station. In 1991, KZOU's owners were trying to exit the radio business and sold the station to GHB Broadcasting. GHB flipped the station to Hot AC as KURB \\"B-98.5\\" following a continued decline in ratings and the overall decline of the top-40 format at the time. In a twist of irony, B-98.5 would assure KKYK would not be able to gloat over its apparent victory. It hired Craig O'Neill back from KKYK and once again beat its former rival, which continued to struggle with its fellow CHR's nationwide. Around 2000, B-98.5 shifted from Hot AC to AC, which it continues to run today.

The glass envelopes illustrate the dark blue color of Wood's glass, although these modern tubes actually use another optical filtering material. Wood's glass is an optical filter glass invented in 1903 by American physicist Robert Williams Wood (1868-1955), which allows ultraviolet and infrared light to pass through, while blocking most visible light. History Wood's glass was developed as a light filter used in communications during World War I. The glass filter worked both in infrared daylight communication and ultraviolet night communications by removing the visible components of a light beam, leaving only the \\"invisible radiation\\" as a signal beam. Wood's glass was commonly used to form the envelope for fluorescent and incandescent ultraviolet bulbs (\\"black lights\\"). In recent years, due to its disadvantages, other filter materials have largely replaced it.\\"...a BLB [black light bulb] has a thin coating of a visible wavelength (VIS) filter generally applied to the inner wall of the bulb\\" from See also the 2009 report: Composition Wood's glass is special barium-sodium-silicate glass incorporating about 9% nickel oxide. It is a very deep violet-blue glass, opaque to all visible light rays except longest red and shortest violet. It is quite transparent in the violet/ultraviolet in a band between 320 and 400 nanometres with a peak at 365 nanometres, and a fairly broad range of infrared and the longest, least visible red wavelengths. Some sources erroneously state presence of cobalt(II) oxide in Wood's glass. Properties and uses Wood's glass has lower mechanical strength and higher thermal expansion than commonly used glasses, making it more vulnerable to thermal shocks and mechanical damage. The nickel and barium oxides are also chemically reactive, with tendency to slowly form a layer of hydroxides and carbonates in contact with atmospheric moisture and carbon dioxide. The susceptibility to thermal shock makes manufacture of hermetically sealed glass bulbs difficult and costly, therefore most contemporary \\"black-light\\" bulbs are made of structurally more suitable glass with only a layer of a UV-filtering enamel on its surface; such bulbs, however, pass much more visible light, appearing brighter to the eye. Due to manufacturing difficulties, Wood's glass is now more commonly used in standalone flat or dome-shaped filters, instead of being the material of the light bulb. With prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation, Wood's glass undergoes solarization, gradually losing transparency for UV. Photographic filters for ultraviolet photography, notably the Kodak Wratten 18A and 18B, are based on Wood's glass. Health effects Bulbs made of Wood's glass are potentially hazardous in comparison with those made of enameled glass, since the reduced visible light output may cause observers to be exposed to unsafe levels of UV, because the source appears dim. The low output of black lights is not considered sufficient to cause DNA damage or cellular mutations, but excessive exposure to UV can cause temporary or permanent damage to the eye.

The postal designation for Chemeketa Park is \\"Los Gatos 95033\\", although it lies approximately five miles South of the official boundaries of the incorporated town of Los Gatos. The community is in area codes 408 and 669. Nearby communities are Redwood Estates, Aldercroft Heights, and the ghost town of Holy City. Chemeketa Park is accessed off of State Route 17, on Old Santa Cruz Highway along the Big Moody Curve. Early history Chemeketa Park was developed in 1925 and 1926 by J.B. Balcomb, a civil engineer from Palo Alto who had acquired a orchard in the Santa Cruz Mountains. An advertisement in the Sunday, June 20, 1926 edition of the San Jose Mercury Herald lists a \\"pre-opening sale\\" of lots \\"as low as $50.00.\\" Initially, lots were used for vacation cabins. The mountain communities of Chemeketa Park and Redwood Estates, etc., were considered too remote, and too difficult to access, for year-round living. Lots were advertised to Bay Area families as a summer retreat, far from the stress of city living in San Francisco or San Jose. By the mid-1930s, with the improvement of roads and water systems, many residents began occupying their cabins year-round and combining smaller lots into larger parcels. The Balcomb Family and Chemeketa Park J.B. Balcomb was killed in an automobile accident in the summer of 1927. His widow and son continued the sale of lots at Chemeketa Park. Balcombs continued to own property in the development until the mid-1960s. Name derivation Chemeketa is a Kalapuya Indian word with various meanings attributed to it, including \\"resting place,\\" \\"meeting place,\\" \\"old home,\\" or \\"old camping ground.\\" The Kalapuya lived in the area now known as the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Chemeketa was an original name of Salem, Oregon, and still exists as the name of a community college, a library district, and various parks and streets in the Salem and Portland areas. When J.B. Balcomb and his wife emigrated from the mid-West to California, they first stopped through eastern Oregon where they most likely heard the name. The Native American theme is present throughout Chemeketa Park with street names including \\"Comanche Trail,\\" \\"Ogallala Warpath,\\" \\"Apache Trail,\\" and \\"Navajo Trail.\\" Governance Chemeketa Park lies in the unincorporated area of Santa Clara County. Districts for local elected representatives are: *1st Supervisorial (County) *18th Congressional (US) *28th State Assembly (CA) *15th Senate (CA) Most of the roads within Chemeketa Park are considered private, and are not maintained by the County. The water system is also privately owned by the community and draws from natural sources and creeks within the Santa Cruz Mountains. The Chemeketa Park Mutual Water Company was incorporated in 1929. Each property owner is a member and shareholder in the water company and may take part in its management. A five- member board is elected from the membership at an annual meeting each Spring. Board members, who are not paid for their service, meet monthly, with meetings open to all members. The board is responsible for hiring the water master and bookkeeper and maintaining the roads. Each property owner pays a set fee each month for water and roads. Additionally, the water company owns and maintains a clubhouse that is used for meetings and community events. A separate volunteer group organizes the events, such as bluegrass music concerts and family picnics. Individual members may also arrange to use the clubhouse for private events.

Hanson became a national figure promoting law and order when he took a hardline position during the 1919 Seattle General Strike. He then resigned as mayor, wrote a book, and toured the lecture circuit, earning tens of thousands of dollars in honoraria lecturing to conservative civic groups about his experiences and views, promoting opposition to labor unions and Bolshevism. Hanson later left Washington and founded the city of San Clemente, California in 1925. Biography Early years Ole Hanson was born in a log cabin in Union Grove in Racine County, Wisconsin, the son of Thorsten Hanson and Goro Tostofson Hanson.Lawrence Kestenbaum, \\"Ole Hanson,\\" PoliticalGraveyard.com Retrieved September 4, 2010. He was the fifth of six children raised by the Norwegian immigrant couple.Don Kindred, The Legend of Ole Hanson (San Clemente Journal, SanClemente.com/) As a teenager, the precocious Hanson worked as a tailor during the day and studied law at night. He passed the Wisconsin bar in 1893, despite being two years too young to practice law. In the end, Hanson never did work in the legal profession, instead going into the grocery business before moving west and going into real estate.Ole Hanson Quits as Seattle Mayor (New York Times August 29, 1919) He worked as a real estate developer and co-founded Lake Forest Park, Washington in 1912 as a rural planned community for professionals in the Seattle area. Political career Entering political life, he served in the Washington House of Representatives during 1908 and 1909. In 1912 he supported Theodore Roosevelt for President of the United States. In 1914, Hanson himself ran for the United States Senate as the candidate of the so-called Bull Moose Party. Hanson garnered nearly a quarter of the vote in the five-way race, won by Republican incumbent Wesley Livsey Jones with a 37% plurality. In 1918, Hanson was elected the thirty-third mayor of Seattle. University Bridge, July 1, 1919. While in office, he became famous for claiming that he broke the Seattle General Strike of 1919, even though conservative national labor leaders pressured the Seattle unions into ending the general strike and Hanson's intervention mattered little. [Source?] Nevertheless, he was hailed by some of the press as a defender of public order against labor radicals. In April 1919, anarchists made him one of the targets of booby-trap bombs mailed to approximately 30 prominent American officials. Hanson survived the assassination attempt, and responded by calling for a nationwide campaign of hangings and life imprisonment for members of the I.W.W. and other radicals. He resigned as Mayor on August 28, 1919, saying: \\"I am tired out and am going fishing.\\" Following his resignation, Hanson set to work writing a book on what he perceived to be the radical menace to America, published in January 1920 in the immediate aftermath of the so-called \\"Palmer Raids\\" as Americanism versus Bolshevism. In this tome, Hanson declared:Ole Hanson, Americanism versus Bolshevism. New York: Doubleday, Page & Co., 1920; pp. vii-viii. In Hanson's view, the fact that the 1919 Seattle general strike was peaceful belied its revolutionary nature and intent. He wrote:Quoted in Jeremy Brecher, Strike!, 126 Ole Hanson and his wife were parents to ten children, one of whom died in infancy in a train wreck Hanson toured the country giving lectures about the dangers of \\"domestic bolshevism.\\" He earned $38,000 in 7 months, 5 times his annual salary as mayor. Founding San Clemente In 1925, Hanson put some of his wealth to work by purchasing a tract at the southern tip of Orange County, California. Hanson believed that the area's pleasant climate, beautiful beaches and fertile soil would serve as a haven to Californians who were tired of urban life. He named the city San Clemente after neighboring San Clemente Island, southernmost of California's Channel Islands. Hanson envisioned his new project as a Spanish-style coastal resort town. He proclaimed, \\"I have a clean canvas and I am determined to paint a clean picture. Think of it ‚Äî a canvas five miles long and one-half miles wide!\\" In an unprecedented move, Hanson had a clause added to all deeds requiring that building plans be submitted to an architectural review board in an effort to ensure that future development would retain Spanish Colonial Revival style influence. Red tile roofs became a stylistic signature of the new community. Hanson succeeded in promoting his new venture and selling property to interested buyers. The area was officially incorporated as a city on February 27, 1928. Over the years, Hanson built various public structures in San Clemente, including the Beach Club, the Community Center, the pier, and Max Berg Plaza Park, which were later donated to the city. He also had a Spanish Style home built overlooking the San Clemente Pier. This home was later named Casa Romantica. The Great Depression did not treat Hanson kindly. Financially leveraged with mortgages on his various property ventures, Hanson lost all his remaining holdings, including his beloved mansion in San Clemente. Hanson eventually moved along to launch a new property development at Twentynine Palms in San Bernardino County, California. Death and legacy Ole Hanson died of a heart attack on July 6, 1940 in Los Angeles, California. He was 66 years old at the time of his death. Hanson was survived by his widow and ten children. The city of San Clemente bears numerous reminders of its founding father, including the Ole Hanson historic pool which overlooks the Pacific Ocean. His home in the center of the city overlooking the historic pier was restored and opened to the community as a cultural center.

As a child he went to Globe Lane Primary School and Audenshaw High School. As a young lad he played for Stalybridge Celtic, and was later picked up by the Tameside Centre of Excellence. From there he picked up a Youth Training Scheme with the Oldham Athletic youth team, which led to him signing a professional contract with Oldham Athletic in 1999. Rumours spread early in his career of a possible move to the Premier League with either Bolton Wanderers or Blackburn Rovers, but a string of injuries, culminating in a long period of absence due to patella tendinitis, proved to be a frustration to his progress. He spent one month's loan at Scarborough in 2003, only playing the first half of one game before returning to Oldham Athletic. He made a total of 78 appearances for Oldham. He joined Shrewsbury Town on 13 May 2006. After joining Shrewsbury, Hall commented on his delight at signing for a club who are ambitious and also seem to be heading in the right direction under manager Gary Peters. Gary Peters claims to have been following the progress of Danny for around 3 years, starting during his time at Everton. At this time Hall was 19 years old and just making his step up to first team football at Oldham. Hall made his Shrewsbury debut in the 2006‚Äì07 opener against Mansfield Town, which finished 2‚Äì2. He went on to make a total of 27 league appearances over the course of the season. On 10 January 2008 he completed a move to Scottish Premier League side Gretna until the end of the season. Hall was one of forty remaining employees made redundant by Gretna on 19 May 2008, shortly before the club was forced out of business due to financial problems. Hall signed an initial one-year contract with Chesterfield in July 2008. Hall made thirty-two league appearances during a two-year stay at Saltergate, scoring twice. During his second season at Chesterfield, the player spent a brief period on loan at Darlington. In May 2010, Hall opted to drop down a division to go and play for Conference National side Crawley Town. It was reported that Crawley had fought off competition from other clubs to sign Hall. On 7 January 2011, Hall signed for fellow Conference National side Forest Green Rovers on a short-term loan deal. He was given the number 16 shirt number. He made his debut the next day in a 1‚Äì0 victory over Fleetwood Town. Hall impressed in his first month at The New Lawn and Rovers extended his loan contract until April. After 17 appearances his loan spell with Forest Green expired after their home victory over Altrincham on 9 April 2011. He returned to Crawley on the same day they had secured promotion to the Football League for the first time in their history. He joined Stockport County on an initial month deal in August 2011 but was released on 1 September after his contract had expired, having appeared just once for the club.Latest News . stockportcounty.com. 3 September 2011. Just a day after his release from Stockport, he joined Conference North outfit Hyde. In May 2012 he joined Altrincham. Shortly after Mark Bower took over Guiseley, He signed Hall. He was a key player for The Lions Promotion push. Covering for Danny Ellis after his injury he made a solid partnership with Adam Lockwood. In the pre-season of 2014‚Äì15 playing against Farsley he broke his leg and missed the first half of the season. Danny joined Bradford Park Avenue on a season long loan from Guiseley on 21 August 2015. He subsequently joined Curzon Ashton in the summer of 2016. In September 2016 he returned to Altrincham before leaving the club again in November.http://www.nonleaguedaily.com/latest-transfer-news/one-defender-in- one-out-at-altrincham.html He finished his career at Mossleyhttps://www.mossleycorrespondent.co.uk/?p=3463 Honours ;Shrewsbury Town *Football League Two Play-off Final runner-up: (1) 2006‚Äì07 ;Chesterfield *Banner Jones Middleton Cup winner: (1) 2008‚Äì09 References External links * * Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Ashton-under-Lyne Category:English footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Oldham Athletic A.F.C. players Category:Scarborough F.C. players Category:Shrewsbury Town F.C. players Category:Gretna F.C. players Category:Chesterfield F.C. players Category:Darlington F.C. players Category:Crawley Town F.C. players Category:Stockport County F.C. players Category:Hyde United F.C. players Category:Altrincham F.C. players Category:Celtic Nation F.C. players Category:Guiseley A.F.C. players Category:Bradford (Park Avenue) A.F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Scottish Premier League players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Curzon Ashton F.C. players Category:Stalybridge Celtic F.C. players Category:Droylsden F.C. players Category:Mossley A.F.C. players ","title":"Danny Hall (footballer)"},{"id":"4264509","text":"To the definition of an ovoid: t tangent, s secant line In projective geometry an ovoid is a sphere like pointset (surface) in a projective space of dimension . Simple examples in a real projective space are hyperspheres (quadrics). The essential geometric properties of an ovoid \\\\mathcal O are: # Any line intersects \\\\mathcal O in at most 2 points, # The tangents at a point cover a hyperplane (and nothing more), and # \\\\mathcal O contains no lines. Property 2) excludes degenerated cases (cones,...). Property 3) excludes ruled surfaces (hyperboloids of one sheet, ...). An ovoid is the spatial analog of an oval in a projective plane. An ovoid is a special type of a quadratic set. Ovoids play an essential role in constructing examples of M√∂bius planes and higher dimensional M√∂bius geometries.  Definition of an ovoid  * In a projective space of dimension a set \\\\mathcal O of points is called an ovoid, if : (1) Any line meets \\\\mathcal O in at most 2 points. In the case of g\\\\cap\\\\mathcal O=0, the line is called a passing (or exterior) line, if g\\\\cap\\\\mathcal O=1 the line is a tangent line, and if g\\\\cap\\\\mathcal O=2 the line is a secant line. : (2) At any point P \\\\in \\\\mathcal O the tangent lines through cover a hyperplane, the tangent hyperplane, (i.e., a projective subspace of dimension ). : (3) \\\\mathcal O contains no lines. From the viewpoint of the hyperplane sections, an ovoid is a rather homogeneous object, because *For an ovoid \\\\mathcal O and a hyperplane \\\\varepsilon, which contains at least two points of \\\\mathcal O, the subset \\\\varepsilon \\\\cap \\\\mathcal O is an ovoid (or an oval, if ) within the hyperplane \\\\varepsilon. For finite projective spaces of dimension (i.e., the point set is finite, the space is pappian), the following result is true: * If \\\\mathcal O is an ovoid in a finite projective space of dimension , then . :(In the finite case, ovoids exist only in 3-dimensional spaces.) *In a finite projective space of order (i.e. any line contains exactly points) and dimension any pointset \\\\mathcal O is an ovoid if and only if \\\\mathcal O=n^2+1 and no three points are collinear (on a common line). Replacing the word projective in the definition of an ovoid by affine, gives the definition of an affine ovoid. If for an (projective) ovoid there is a suitable hyperplane \\\\varepsilon not intersecting it, one can call this hyperplane the hyperplane \\\\varepsilon_\\\\infty at infinity and the ovoid becomes an affine ovoid in the affine space corresponding to \\\\varepsilon_\\\\infty. Also, any affine ovoid can be considered a projective ovoid in the projective closure (adding a hyperplane at infinity) of the affine space.  Examples   In real projective space (inhomogeneous representation)  #\\\\mathcal O=\\\\\\\\{(x_1,...,x_d)\\\\in {\\\\mathbb R}^d \\\\; \\\\; x_1^2+\\\\cdots +x_d^2=1\\\\\\\\}\\\\ , (hypersphere) #\\\\mathcal O=\\\\\\\\{(x_1,...,x_d)\\\\in {\\\\mathbb R}^d \\\\;  x_d=x_1^2+\\\\cdots +x_{d-1}^2\\\\; \\\\\\\\} \\\\; \\\\cup \\\\; \\\\\\\\{\\\\text{point at infinity of } x_d\\\\text{-axis}\\\\\\\\} These two examples are quadrics and are projectively equivalent. Simple examples, which are not quadrics can be obtained by the following constructions: : (a) Glue one half of a hypersphere to a suitable hyperellipsoid in a smooth way. : (b) In the first two examples replace the expression by . Remark: The real examples can not be converted into the complex case (projective space over {\\\\mathbb C}). In a complex projective space of dimension there are no ovoidal quadrics, because in that case any non degenerated quadric contains lines. But the following method guarantees many non quadric ovoids: * For any non-finite projective space the existence of ovoids can be proven using transfinite induction.W. Heise: Bericht √ºber \\\\kappa-affine Geometrien, Journ. of Geometry 1 (1971), S. 197‚Äì224, Satz 3.4.F. Buekenhout: A Characterization of Semi Quadrics, Atti dei Convegni Lincei 17 (1976), S. 393-421, chapter 3.5  Finite examples  * Any ovoid \\\\mathcal O in a finite projective space of dimension over a field of characteristic is a quadric. The last result can not be extended to even characteristic, because of the following non-quadric examples: * For K=GF(2^m),\\\\; m odd and \\\\sigma the automorphism x \\\\mapsto x^{(2^{\\\\frac{m+1}{2}})}\\\\; , the pointset :\\\\mathcal O=\\\\\\\\{(x,y,z)\\\\in K^3 \\\\; \\\\; z=xy+x^2x^\\\\sigma+y^\\\\sigma \\\\\\\\} \\\\; \\\\cup \\\\; \\\\\\\\{\\\\text{point of infinity of the } z\\\\text{-axis}\\\\\\\\} is an ovoid in the 3-dimensional projective space over (represented in inhomogeneous coordinates). :Only when is the ovoid \\\\mathcal O a quadric. :\\\\mathcal O is called the Tits-Suzuki-ovoid.  Criteria for an ovoid to be a quadric  An ovoidal quadric has many symmetries. In particular: * Let be \\\\mathcal O an ovoid in a projective space \\\\mathfrak P of dimension and \\\\varepsilon a hyperplane. If the ovoid is symmetric to any point P \\\\in \\\\varepsilon \\\\setminus \\\\mathcal O (i.e. there is an involutory perspectivity with center P which leaves \\\\mathcal O invariant), then \\\\mathfrak P is pappian and \\\\mathcal O a quadric.H. M√§urer: Ovoide mit Symmetrien an den Punkten einer Hyperebene, Abh. Math. Sem. Hamburg 45 (1976), S.237-244 *An ovoid \\\\mathcal O in a projective space \\\\mathfrak P is a quadric, if the group of projectivities, which leave \\\\mathcal O invariant operates 3-transitively on \\\\mathcal O, i.e. for two triples A_1,A_2,A_3,\\\\; B_1,B_2,B_3 there exists a projectivity \\\\pi with \\\\pi(A_i)=B_i,\\\\; i=1,2,3.J. Tits: Ovoides √† Translations, Rend. Mat. 21 (1962), S. 37‚Äì59. In the finite case one gets from Segre's theorem: * Let be \\\\mathcal O an ovoid in a finite 3-dimensional desarguesian projective space \\\\mathfrak P of odd order, then \\\\mathfrak P is pappian and \\\\mathcal O is a quadric.  Generalization: semi ovoid  Removing condition (1) from the definition of an ovoid results in the definition of a semi-ovoid: :A point set \\\\mathcal O of a projective space is called a semi-ovoid if the following conditions hold: :(SO1) For any point P \\\\in \\\\mathcal O the tangents through point P exactly cover a hyperplane. : (SO2) \\\\mathcal O contains no lines. A semi ovoid is a special semi-quadratic setF. Buekenhout: A Characterization of Semi Quadrics, Atti dei Convegni Lincei 17 (1976), S. 393-421. which is a generalization of a quadratic set. The essential difference between a semi-quadratic set and a quadratic set is the fact, that there can be lines which have 3 points in common with the set and the lines are not contained in the set. Examples of semi-ovoids are the sets of isotropic points of an hermitian form. They are called hermitian quadrics. As for ovoids in literature there are criteria, which make a semi-ovoid to a hermitian quadric. See, for exampleK.J.

He was born in Red Banks, Mississippi. When he was a child, his father, Grant Belfour, taught him to play the guitar, and he continued his tutelage in the blues from the musicians Otha Turner, R. L. Burnside, and Junior Kimbrough. Kimbrough, in particular, had a profound influence on him. His music was rooted in Mississippi hill country traditions, in contrast to Delta blues. His playing was characterized by a percussive attack and alternate tunings. When Belfour was thirteen, his father died, and music was relegated to what free time he had, as his energy went to helping his mother provide for the family. In 1959, he married Noreen Norman and moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he worked in construction for the next 35 years. In the 1980s, Belfour began playing on Beale Street. Eight of his songs are included on the musicologist David Evans's compilation album The Spirit Lives On: Deep South Country Blues and Spirituals in the 1990s, released by the German Hot Fox label in 1994. This led Belfour to Fat Possum Records and record his first album, What's Wrong With You, released in 2000. The album Pushin' My Luck followed in 2003, receiving a positive critical review.

It includes the John Hauberg Museum of Native American Life. The state park is located on a bluff overlooking the Rock River in western Illinois. It is most famous for being the birthplace of the Sauk warrior Black Hawk. The disputed cession of this area to the U.S. Government was the catalyst for the Black Hawk War. Under the Sauk Map of Rock Island at Saukenuk, 1820 The Sauk nation occupied this site as their principal village, called \\"Saukenuk.\\" It was a well-drained area, suitable for growing corn. The Sauk had arrived by 1750, probably after the Fox Wars (1712-1733). When the explorer Jonathan Carver reached Saukenuk in 1766, he called it \\"the largest and best built Indian town\\" he had ever seen, \\"more like a civilized town than the abode of savages.\\" The Sauk successfully farmed the area during part of the year and spent the winters in camps down and across the Mississippi collecting fur-bearing animals. Sauk hunters skinned their catches and sold the peltry to fur traders from the Great Lakes. From 1763 on, these traders were mostly British, and from the 1780s on, most of them were employees or contractors of the Canada-based North West Company. In the spring, the Sauk gathered in sugar camps for maple sugaring before returning to the village (left empty since the fall) to plant crops and bury their dead. The Sauk developed military and economic ties with British Canada. Due to these ties, the Sauk expected British military assistance. Some of the Sauk traveled every year to British forts on far-away Lake Superior and near Detroit for trading and gift-giving. A disputed 1804 St. Louis Treaty between Quashquame and William Henry Harrison led to the transfer of Illinois lands to the U.S. Government, including Saukenuk. The Sauk did not consider this treaty valid, and they continued to live at the village.Channick, Herbert S. (1998) \\"William Henry Harrison Steals Western Illinois From the Sauk and Fox\\" Illinois Heritage 1(2):6-10. When Thomas Forsyth arrived in Saukenuk in 1817, he described it as the most populous Indian village he had ever seen. By 1826, an estimated 4,800 Sauk lived in and around Saukenuk. Others who passed through, such as William H. Keating, noted that the village was not limited to the Sauk. Keating estimated only about 20% of the warriors that the Sauk could muster had pure Sauk ancestry. It was the largest single settlement in the new U.S. state of Illinois. This is how Black Hawk described Saukenuk: thumbuprightBlack Hawk led the Sauk and Fox Indians in many battles from the War of 1812 to the Black Hawk War of 1832 from a painting by artist George Catlin Plaster life cast of Black Hawk, original ca. 1830, at Black Hawk State Historic Site The Black Hawk War Black Hawk War Memorial at Black Hawk State Historic Site The defeat of the British Canadians in the War of 1812 and the spread of settlers into Illinois and up the Mississippi River doomed the village. In multiple treaties, many of the Sauk had signed land cessions that sold the land under Saukenuk to the new American nation. Part of the tribe established new villages in Iowa and in Missouri nearer their winter hunting grounds. The campaign of 1832 led to a complete victory for the U.S. Army and the state of Illinois. Many of Black Hawk's followers were killed and the Quad Cities region was completely opened to settlement. However, many white Americans admired Black Hawk's courage in defense of his band's ancestral lands, and the native leader was elevated to the rank of a folk hero. A statue of Black Hawk was raised on the site in 1892, and the Civilian Conservation Corps redeveloped and improved the park in 1934-1942. The village site today The last couple of blocks on the southern portion of 11th street Rock Island (HWY 67) now cover the former site of the Sauk village of Saukenuk, with Black Hawk State Historic Site and John Hauberg Museum of Native American Life slightly to the east. Saukenuk had strong ties with the Meskwaki village to the north, what is now downtown Rock Island. Vandruff Island in the Rock River to the south of the village was also a place in which villagers spent their days. The island is now mainly a 180-foot-deep quarry with some residential development on the west side. The historic site is served by Illinois Route 5, which intersects with Interstate 74 in nearby Moline, Illinois at exit #4. John Hauberg Museum of Native American Life The Hauberg Museum specializes in Sauk and Mesquakie cultural objects and artifacts. The museum is located in a lodge constructed in 1934 by the Civilian Conservation Corps and was named after Dr. John Hauberg, a philanthropist from Rock Island. Exhibits include full-size replicas of Sauk winter and summer houses, dioramas depicting Native life typical of the period from 1750 to 1830, trade goods, jewelry and domestic items, and several Black Hawk artifacts, including his tomahawk, two of his clay tobacco pipes, and a bronze bust fashioned from a plaster life mask.

On return they converted an Austin van, which attracted five orders from Henlys in Bristol. Going into business with local builder Bob Halling, the first retail products were produced. Auto-Sleepers clamshell design, based on a Volkswagen Transporter (T4) chassis Auto-Sleepers core product developed through the adoption of the successful monocoque body, a two-piece clamshell glass-fibre unit which gave the living unit strength and a lack of edge joints, which on a traditional sandwich construction produce a weaker body which is prone to leaking. The company developed rapidly and quickly became a product market leader in the United Kingdom, as well as exporting its vehicles to France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, New Zealand, Australia and Japan The Trevelyan family sold the business in 1997 to Steven Riley and Bill Cook, whilst retaining a small shareholding themselves.

The Whin Sill or Great Whin Sill is a tabular layer of the igneous rock dolerite in County Durham, Northumberland and Cumbria in the northeast of England. It lies partly in the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and partly in Northumberland National Park and stretches from Teesdale northwards towards Berwick. It is one of the key natural features of the North Pennines. A major outcrop is at the High Force waterfall in Teesdale. Bamburgh Castle, Dunstanburgh Castle, Lindisfarne Castle and stretches of Hadrian's Wall all strategically take advantage of high, rocky cliff lines formed by the sill. The Whin Sill complex is usually divided into three components: Holy Island Sill, Alnwick Sill and the Hadrian's Wall-Pennines Sill, which were created by separate magma flows, but at about the same time.D. Liss, W.H. Owens and D.H.W. Hutton, New palaeomagnetic results from the Whin Sill complex: evidence for a multiple intrusion event and revised virtual geomagnetic poles for the late Carboniferous for the British Isles, Journal of the Geological Society; December 2004; v. 161; no. 6; p. 927‚Äì938; , 2004 Geological Society of London, England The Little Whin Sill is an associated formation to the south, in Weardale. Derivation of name Much of the early study of geology began in the British Isles, whence much of the terminology is derived. Quarrymen of Northern England used the term 'sill' to describe a more or less horizontal body of rock. 'Whin' was applied to dark, hard rocks. As the intrusive igneous origin of the Whin Sill was determined in the 19th century, the term 'sill' was adopted by geologists for concordant, tabular intrusive bodies. Geology Towards the close of Carboniferous Period and in the early Permian, some 295 million years ago (Ma), crustal extension caused by movement of the Earth's tectonic plates during the Variscan orogeny allowed the emplacement of igneous intrusions of magma across much of northern England of a suite of tholeiitic dolerite intrusions. These were largely concordant with the strata of the existing country rock. On cooling, these crystallised and solidified to form the Great Whin Sill. It is dated at around 301- 294 million years old, thus spanning the Carboniferous/Permian boundary at 299 Ma. It underlies much of south and east Northumberland and the Durham Coalfield. Its maximum known thickness of around 70 metres occurs in the North Pennines. Surface and subsurface records of the Great Whin reveal it is not always concordant over wide areas and often rises and falls in the stratigraphical succession in marked leaps and gentle transgressions different levels. Studies of the petrology of the dolerites of the Whin Sill complex have revealed significant differences between the Little Whin and the Great Whin. The Little Whin Sill is olivine-bearing and believed to be composed of an early differentiate of the Whin dolerite magma. On the other hand, the Great Whin, non-olivine-bearing and slightly density graded, is a later differentiate of the Whin magma. Two separate periods of Whin dolerite injection are confirmed by studies of vitrinite reflectance over the Alston Block where two periods of Whin contact metamorphism have been recognized. The two periods of Whin dolerite emplacement form part of the end-Carboniferous earth movements in northern England. They can be shown to have occurred between a period of compression from a W-SW direction and later gentle doming of the Alston Block near the Westphalian-Stephanian boundary, dated about 300‚Äì295 Ma. The lithology is notable in many respects, including well developed pegmatite segregations which can be found in Upper Teesdale. Late stage hydrothermal mineralisation has filled the joints with pectolite. The dolerite has been carbonated as metasomatic selvages into veins and joints and other flaws to produce 'White Whin'. Thermal metamorphism of the country rock in the contact zone produced coarse grained marbles within the aureole in a small number of places in Teesdale. Disused roadstone quarries along the course of the sill offer sections for its interpretation. Long ridges of basalt, such as that between Cauldron Snout and Lonton may indicate the presence of surface fissure eruptions. Effects on landscape and geography The regolith supports alpine/Arctic flora which includes spring gentian (Gentiana verna), bird's-eye primrose (Primula farinosa), mountain avens (Dryas octopetala) and Teesdale violet (Viola rupestris). This is an example of the intimate interaction and dependence of geology and ecology. The resistance to erosion of the dolerite gives rise to a number of striking geomorphological features such as High Force, Low Force, Cauldron Snout, High Cup Nick and Holwick Scars.

The station opened in 1887 and closed in 1958 when the Erie Railroad moved its passenger services to nearby Hoboken Terminal. The New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway also ran commuter trains from the terminal and various street cars, ferries and the underground Hudson and Manhattan Railroad serviced the station. The station was abandoned in 1958 and demolished in 1961. History Pavonia was one of five passenger railroad terminals that lined the western shore of the Hudson Waterfront from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries, along with those at Weehawken, Hoboken, Exchange Place, and Communipaw, with Hoboken being the only one still in service. The Erie began developing the waterfront site in 1856. The intermodal complex was open December 4, 1887. Across the river- facing facade was New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad, the name of the entity that built it, though it was also called Jersey City Terminal StationJersey City Terminal Station or Erie Railroad Station The colloquial name is taken from the 17th century European settlement of Pavonia, New Netherland, which began in the area and the ferry that served it. It has been described as \\"a brightly colored Victorian eclectic three story terminal located at the foot of Pavonia Avenue to serve a twelve track\\" station. It was designed by George E. Archer. The end of track was at about 40.7266 N 74.0304 W. Besides the railroad, the complex was served by ferries, streetcars and the rapid transit Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (now PATH). The terminal was also used by New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway trains.NYSW Stations Long distance and suburban passenger trains reached the terminal by travelling through Bergen Hill via the Long Dock Tunnel and later under the Bergen Arches. In October 1956 the Erie Railroad began moving its trains out of Pavonia Terminal and into Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad's Hoboken Terminal, and by 1960 had merged to become the Erie Lackawanna Railway. Erie's Northern Branch trains moved to Hoboken in 1959; the New York, Susquehanna and Western operated to the terminal until it pulled back to Susquehanna Transfer in 1961. The terminal was razed by 1961. Service Railroads The few remnants of the Erie's extensive holdings include the embankment from the Palisades to the river (now demolished) The Erie Railroad's Main Line ran from Jersey City to Chicago via Binghamton and Youngstown; with a line to Buffalo, and a line to Akron with a spur to Cleveland.http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/1884_Erie.gif The name and a portion of the route exists in the form of the New Jersey Transit Main Line to Suffern, New York and, under contract for Metro North, all the way to Port Jervis. Parts of the contemporary Bergen County Line and Pascack Valley Line were also Erie operated, while sections of its Greenwood Lake Branch have been incorporated into the Montclair-Boonton Line. The Northern Branch of the Northern Railroad of New Jersey is another line from the Erie era along which freight is transported and that may be revived as light rail service. The last train to leave the station, the #1205 at 6:35 p.m. on Friday, December 12, 1958, was along the Northern Branch. The Newark Branch (with continuing service to Paterson) and the Orange Branch were also parts of its suburban network. The New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway main line ran to Wilkes-Barre, although passenger service was operated that far for only a few years (and that Wilkes Barre and Eastern line was completely abandoned, even for freight service, in 1939), while regular commuter service ran only to Butler, NJ until 1966. The timetable for August 17, 1947, shows 96 weekday departures: 48 to the main line and Bergen County line (including 6 long distance routes beyond Port Jervis), 6 to Spring Valley, 26 NY&GL;, 5 Newark Branch, 3 to Nyack and 8 NYS&W.; Named trains, many of them long distance, originated at the station. These included Atlantic Express, Erie Limited, Lake Cities, Midlander, Mountain Express, Pacific Express, and Southern Tier Express. Ferry An undated photograph of an Erie-owned ferryboat named the \\"Susquehanna\\" docked at the Pavonia Ferry Terminal. The Pavonia Ferry began running in 1851, along a route that had been established some decades earlier as Budd's Ferry. It was taken over by the Erie and sold to the Pavonia Ferry Company of Jersey City for what was considered a low price of $9,050, at New York City Hall, in February 1854. In February 1859 Nathaniel Marsh of the Erie Railroad Company purchased the lease on behalf of the Pavonia Ferry Company. He started a ferry which ran from Chambers Street (Manhattan) to the foot Pavonia Avenue on the other side of the Hudson River. Legal problems had prevented the Pavonia Ferry Company from establishing a ferry along this route. The New York and Erie Railroad paid an annual rent of $9,050 to transport passengers back and forth. Eventually the railroad constructed its Pavonia Terminal on the land-filled Harsimus Cove. Suburban and long distance travelers would transfer from trains to boats for the passage across the river. Its final two routes from the terminal across the Hudson to Lower Manhattan were to Chambers Street Ferry Terminal and 23rd Street. New York Waterway re-introduced service to Pier 79 at West 39th Street on December 1, 2006. Service officially ended January 2014. Ferry service is being restored in the Summer of 2019. Streetcar Newport PATH station Numerous streetcar lines served the station. Eventually they (and indeed all of Hudson County lines) were operated by the Public Service Railway. The Grove Street, which operated between Exchange Place and Hudson Place (Hoboken), passed nearby. The Pavonia and the Crosstown originated at the station. The Hudson Bergen Light Rail Pavonia/Newport Station opened in 2002, and is located one and half blocks west of the PATH system. H & M tube station Originally named \\"Erie\\", the PATH's Newport station, originally built by the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (H&M;), still bears the letter \\"E\\" engraved on its pillars. Opened on August 2, 1909, the station was built with only the island platform. The side platform was added around 1914 to handle the heavier passenger volume. It was closed in 1954 in order for the bankrupt railroad to reduce costs. The side platform remained dormant for nearly 50 years. The northernmost stairway exit from the two platforms led to a steep passageway, which originally went directly to the Erie Railroad terminal. In the 1920s, a second passageway and mezzanine area was built over the existing platforms and northbound trackway. This second passageway and mezzanine area were also closed in 1954 (as was also the entrance to/from Henderson Street), but was reopened in the late 1980s/early 1990s after the station was renovated. Also in 1954, the first moving sidewalk, or travellator, in the United States was installed. Named the \\"Speedwalk\\" and built by Goodyear, it was long and moved up a 10-percent grade at a speed of . The walkway was removed a few years later when traffic patterns at the station changed. Site Site of former terminal across the Long Slip. Ventilation tower is part of Holland Tunnel, which contributed to the demise of terminals along the west bank of the North River. The complex was built on the northern portion of landfilled Harsimus Cove. The southern part was the Pennsylvania Railroad abattoir and freight yard. A narrow slip kept that name, while another called the Long Slip was created and separated it from Hoboken Terminal. The only visible trace of the Erie's waterfront complex that remains today is part of the right of way/viaduct which carried trains from the foot of the Palisades escarpment to the waterfront. Part of it runs parallel to Boyle Plaza (the toll plaza for the Holland Tunnel) and is used for motor vehicular traffic to the Newport Section of the city.Erie ROW See also *North River (Hudson River) *Bergen Hill *Timeline of Jersey City area railroads *List of ferries across the Hudson River in New York City *Railroad terminals in New York City *Houston, West Street and Pavonia Ferry Railroad *Pier 63 References External links *New York Times 1873 Terminal fire *New York Times 1903 terminal relocation *New York times 1903 letter listing ferries * Evolution of the New York Harbor ferries *Overview of rail companies serving Hudson Waterfront *Departure from terminal (video) *New York, Lake Erie, and Western Jersey City Passenger Terminal 1886 *meeting to discuss better service 1879 *Paterson and Newark Railroad *and Pavonia collision *photos of Hudson River ferries and terminals *Map of Erie System 1884 Category:Former Erie Railroad stations Category:Railway stations in New Jersey Category:Former New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway stations Category:Demolished buildings and structures in New Jersey Category:Defunct railway stations in New Jersey Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1887 Category:Railway stations closed in 1958 Category:Ferry terminals in New Jersey Category:Ferries of New Jersey Category:Ferries of New York City Category:Water transportation in New York City Category:Railway stations in Hudson County, New Jersey Category:Hudson River Category:Transit hubs serving New Jersey Category:Demolished railway stations in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Jersey City, New Jersey Category:1887 establishments in New Jersey Category:1958 disestablishments in New Jersey ","title":"Pavonia Terminal"},{"id":"4264590","text":"Labour Inspection Convention, 1947 is an International Labour Organization Convention.

morphism. is a homomorphism that sends a Boolean algebra B onto the two-element Boolean algebra 2 = {0,1}. It is essentially the same thing as an ultrafilter on B, and, in a different way, also the same things as a maximal ideal of B. 2-valued morphisms have also been proposed as a tool for unifying the language of physics.  2-valued morphisms, ultrafilters and maximal ideals  Suppose B is a Boolean algebra. * If s : B -> 2 is a 2-valued morphisms, then the set of elements of B that are sent to 1 is an ultrafilter on B, and the set of elements of B that are sent to 0 is a maximal ideal of B. * If U is an ultrafilter on B, then the complement of U is a maximal ideal of B, and there is exactly one 2-valued morphism s : B -> 2 that sends the ultrafilter to 1 and the maximal ideal to 0. * If M is a maximal ideal of B, then the complement of M is an ultrafilter on B, and there is exactly one 2-valued morphism s : B -> 2 that sends the ultrafilter to 1 and the maximal ideal to 0.  Physics  If the elements of B are viewed as \\"propositions about some object\\", then a 2-valued morphism on B can be interpreted as representing a particular \\"state of that object\\", namely the one where the propositions of B which are mapped to 1 are true, and the propositions mapped to 0 are false. Since the morphism conserves the Boolean operators (negation, conjunction, etc.), the set of true propositions will not be inconsistent but will correspond to a particular maximal conjunction of propositions, denoting the (atomic) state. (The true propositions form an ultrafilter, the false propositions form a maximal ideal, as mentioned above.) The transition between two states s1 and s2 of B, represented by 2-valued morphisms, can then be represented by an automorphism f from B to B, such that s2 o f = s1. The possible states of different objects defined in this way can be conceived as representing potential events. The set of events can then be structured in the same way as invariance of causal structure, or local-to- global causal connections or even formal properties of global causal connections. The morphisms between (non-trivial) objects could be viewed as representing causal connections leading from one event to another one. For example, the morphism f above leads form event s1 to event s2. The sequences or \\"paths\\" of morphisms for which there is no inverse morphism, could then be interpreted as defining horismotic or chronological precedence relations. These relations would then determine a temporal order, a topology, and possibly a metric. According to, \\"A minimal realization of such a relationally determined space-time structure can be found\\". In this model there are, however, no explicit distinctions. This is equivalent to a model where each object is characterized by only one distinction: (presence, absence) or (existence, non-existence) of an event. In this manner, \\"the 'arrows' or the 'structural language' can then be interpreted as morphisms which conserve this unique distinction\\". If more than one distinction is considered, however, the model becomes much more complex, and the interpretation of distinction states as events, or morphisms as processes, is much less straightforward.

Biography  Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, he received his Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Manitoba in 1961. A gold medalist in his graduating class, Posner pursued post-graduate work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland before joining the Royal Victoria Hospital and the McGill University Faculty of Medicine in 1970 as an assistant professor. He was appointed to the ranks of Associate Professor in 1975 and Professor in 1979. He is currently the Director of the Polypeptide Hormone Laboratory at McGill University and a Professor in the Department of Medicine and the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, as well as senior physician at the Royal Victoria Hospital. He has served as Director of the McGill Endocrine training program and physician-in-chief at the Sir Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General Hospital.  Research  His fundamental research on insulin signaling led to the discovery of the endosomal system and the view that this is a central site for both initiating and regulating signal transduction. In the late 1980s, he discovered the peroxovanadium compounds as potent insulin mimetics; and in elucidating their mechanism of action, he defined the key role of phosphotyrosine phosphatases in regulating receptor tyrosine kinases. His group went on to define the role of lipid rafts as sites of intense signaling at both the cell surface and within endosomes. More recently Posner's diabetes research focused on the genes responsible for diabetes, the discovery of which will aid in the prediction and treatment of this disease.  Publications and scholarly activities  He has published over 290 scientific manuscripts, and, as a Visiting Professor, has delivered numerous prestigious lectures including the Banting and Best Memorial Lecture of the International Diabetes Federation (1991), the Pfizer Lectures at Harvard University (1993), the Joe Doupe Memorial Lecture at the University of Manitoba (1994), the Novartis lecture of the Canadian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism (1997), the David M. Kovitz Memorial Lecture at the University of Calgary (2000), the 2nd John & Mary Davidson Lecture (and Award) of the University of Toronto in 2002, and the Volpe Distinguished Service Award of the Canadian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008).  Recognition and awards  His academic contributions have been recognized by election to the Association of American Physicians (1988), receipt of the Distinguished Scientist Award of the CSCI (1991), election to Fellowship in the Royal Society of Canada, appointment as Officer of the Order of Canada (1999), and receipt of the Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal (2002). In 2014, he was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec; and in 2015 received the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Canadian Diabetes Association.

The car was billed as the \\"F1 on the Road.\\" The original design of the car was done by Kunihisa Ito, who was the vice- president and chief designer of Jiotto Design Incorporated. 1989 Jiotto Caspita (Mk I) The car was the brainchild of the president of Wacoal Corp Yoshikata Tsukamoto and the president of DOME Minoru Hayashi. A joint venture between the two companies was formed in July 1988 by the name of Jiotto Inc (60% held by Wacoal and 40% held by DOME) to design and build the car. The mechanical work was entrusted to Dome while a newly incorporated studio was assigned to design the car. The design emphasis was Group C race cars and keeping that in mind, the car had a sleek and aerodynamic body design. Design mockups of 1/5 scale were made for wind tunnel testing. Later, full size models were made and tested at DOME's own wind tunnel as well as JARI‚Äôs (Japan Automobile Research Institute) wind tunnel for aerodynamic refinement. Jiotto Design selected three designs out of initially proposed 200 for final development. Out of the three, a proposal having an integrated rear wing and large side air intakes was fully developed. The interior focused on the driver and was spartan in nature. It was trimmed in red and black leather. A tachometer with white digits was mounted centrally behind a lightweight twin- spoke steering wheel while all necessary switches were combined into the central console as well as the dashboard; an electronic LED speedometer and fuel gauge were placed on the left along with a small LCD display which displayed fuel and oil pressure. The interior lacked air conditioning, cruise control and other driver amenities. The car had a bonded aluminium and carbon fibre monocoque chassis made by Mitsubishi Rayon Co. The construction technique involved sandwiching aluminium between layers of carbon fibre and then baking them to create a rigid structure. The process was repeated 15 times and it took 2 months to make a chassis. This technique resulted in a weight of . The car was named Caspita which means \\"good heavens!\\" in Italian, an expression of surprise. It was displayed at the 28th Tokyo Motor Show. The Caspita employed advanced technology of the time, such as an electronically retractable rear spoiler and an electronically controlled adjustable suspension system which raised the car by . The first car was powered by a Motori Moderni Flat-twelve engine, a detuned Formula One engine rated at and originally built for Subaru, and then in 1990 a second concept was built with a Judd GV V10 engine, new twin circular taillights, and more traditionally styled side mirrors. The reason being that Subaru took the engine to use in its Formula-one car for the 1990 season. Seeing the disappointing results, Subaru pulled the plug on the project leaving Jiotto without an engine supplier. Both engines were longitudinally mounted, and powered through a 6-speed gearbox built by Wiesmann. The project would die out in 1993 due to the global recession which meant lack of demand for sports cars. With the Judd engine, the Caspita is capable of at 10,750 rpm and of torque at 10,500 rpm. This, along with a curb weight of , gives the Caspita a 0-60 mph (97 km/h) acceleration time of approximately 4.7 seconds and a top speed of . Seeing the positive rception, a limited production run of 30 units was considered.

Life and career Ridpath attended Beal Grammar School in Ilford where he wrote astronomy articles for the school magazine. Before entering publishing he was an assistant in the lunar research group at the University of London Observatory, Mill Hill. He now lives in Brentford, Middlesex.

His early books on the subject of extraterrestrial life and interstellar travel ‚Äì Worlds Beyond (1975), Messages from the Stars (1978) and Life off Earth (1983) ‚Äì led him to investigate UFOs. But he became a sceptic, a position reinforced by his findings about the Rendlesham case. He was one of the first to offer an explanation for the so-called Sirius Mystery involving the supposedly advanced astronomical knowledge of the Dogon people of Mali, west Africa. He was a space expert for LBC Radio from the 1970s into the 1990s, and was also seen on BBC TV's Breakfast Time programme in its early years. It was for Breakfast Time that he first investigated the Rendlesham Forest UFO case.Rendlesham Forest UFO report by Ian Ridpath His star show Planet Earth ran at the London Planetarium from February 1993 to January 1995; it was the last show to use the planetarium's original Zeiss optical projector.Zeiss projector Awards In 2012 he received the Astronomical Society of the Pacific's Klumpke-Roberts Award for outstanding contributions to the public understanding and appreciation of astronomy.ASP 2012 Award Winners In 1990 he won an award in The Aventis Prizes for Science Books (in the under-8 children's books category) for The Giant Book of Space.

It was built in 1830 by Robert Stevenson and has an elevation of and 203 steps to the top of the tower. History At the Battle of Tarbat Ness in the 11th century, Thorfinn the Mighty defeated \\"Karl Hundason\\", possibly a Viking name for Macbeth. Further down the peninsula at Portmahomack, in the 1480s the Clan Ross slaughtered a raiding party from the Clan Mackay by locking them in the Tarbat Old Church and setting fire to it. This event is known as the Battle of Tarbat. Lighthouse Close up view of the Lighthouse A storm in the Moray Firth in November 1826 saw the loss of 16 vessels and brought many applications for lighthouses to be constructed at Tarbat Ness and at Covesea Skerries. Tarbat Ness Lighthouse was engineered by Robert Stevenson for the Northern Lighthouse Board and the light was first exhibited on 26 January 1830. James Smith of Inverness was the contractor responsible for the building of the lighthouse which cost ¬£9,361. The lighthouse tower is the third tallest in Scotland behind North Ronaldsay and Skerryvore and is notable for having two distinguishing broad red bands. Bella Bathurst's 1999 'The Lighthouse Stevensons' refers to a rescue made by the principal keeper William Davidson of 4 of the 5 crew members of a Norwegian schooner. No date given for this. She mentions this in the context that Robert Stevenson required keepers to stay with the light and not risk rescuing shipwrecked people. It seems that even with the light ships could still be driven ashore. She accessed the full entries of logs and diaries available at the Northern Lights Board. Earthquake shocks were sometimes reported and Tarbat Ness once shook so that the shades and lamp glasses rattled. Probably the lighthouse was built on the foundations of a Roman fortification, Roman foundations of the lighthouse that were later identified in the Middle Ages as a \\"Roman landmark\\" near Port a' Chait (now called \\"Port a Chaistell\\").

He was the head football coach at Kentucky State University in Frankfort, Kentucky, a position he held from 2016 until he was fired by the university in 2018. Smith was previously the head football coach at the University of Idaho (1989‚Äì1994), Utah State University (1995‚Äì1997), the University of Louisville (1998‚Äì2002), Michigan State University (2003‚Äì2006), University of Arkansas (2012), and Fort Lewis College in Colorado (2013‚Äì2016). He had been named head coach of his alma mater, Weber State University, after the 2011 season, but left after spring drills to take over at Arkansas following the firing of Bobby Petrino in April 2012. Smith has also been an assistant at multiple programs, most recently at Arkansas under Petrino, where he was in charge of special teams from 2009 to 2011. Early life Born in Idaho Falls in eastern Idaho and raised in nearby Iona, Smith lettered in football, basketball, and track for the Bees at Bonneville High School, and graduated in 1967. He played college football at Weber State College in Ogden, Utah, as both a linebacker and quarterback for the Wildcats in the Big Sky, then a college division conference for football. Smith was a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity and graduated in 1971 with a bachelor's degree in physical education. Coaching career Early coaching career Smith began his coaching career in 1971 as a graduate assistant at his alma mater, Weber State. For the next 17 seasons, Smith was an assistant coach, first at Montana for five seasons (1972‚Äì76) and then at Nevada (1977‚Äì81) for five more as the defensive coordinator. He then joined Dennis Erickson as defensive coordinator and assistant head coach for seven seasons at three schools: Idaho (1982‚Äì85), Wyoming (1986), and Washington State (1987‚Äì88). The middle initial \\"L\\" became part of his public moniker in 1982, due to another John Smith at Idaho, John G. Smith (1924‚Äì1998). On the UI athletic staff since 1965, the elder Smith was the equipment manager at the time; he was the last head baseball coach (1967‚àí1980) and a former assistant coach in football and basketball. Idaho After serving as an assistant head coach under Erickson for seven seasons, Smith began his head coaching career in 1989 back at Idaho, where he posted a record in six seasons. Under his leadership, the Vandals won two Big Sky championships and made the 16-team NCAA Division I-AA playoffs five times, advancing to the national semifinals in 1993. Smith's 53 wins remain the most in school history, seventeen clear of runner-up Erickson (36 in five years). His starting salary at Idaho was under $60,000, but after two seasons he became the first UI coach to be granted a multi-year contract, with a four-year deal in January 1991. Smith inherited an 11‚Äì2 team from Keith Gilbertson that had made the I-AA semifinals in 1988, and returned All- American quarterback in John Friesz. Despite losing the first two games of the 1989 season to Washington State and Portland State, Idaho went undefeated (8‚Äì0) in conference play, the only time in school history; the Vandals lost in the first round of the I-AA playoffs and finished at 9‚Äì3. Friesz won the Walter Payton Award, was drafted by the San Diego Chargers, and spent a decade in the NFL. Smith's next Vandal quarterback was southpaw Doug Nussmeier, who threw for over 10,000 yards and won the Walter Payton Award in 1993; he was drafted in the fourth round by the New Orleans Saints. Utah State In January 1995, Smith left Moscow to move up to Division I-A at Utah State in the Big West, with a five-year contract exceeding $100,000 per year. He stayed in Logan with the Aggies for three seasons (16‚Äì18, .470). Although Smith took another job in late November, he coached the 1997 Aggies in the first Humanitarian Bowl on December 29, a loss to Cincinnati. Louisville On November 24, 1997, Louisville hired Smith as head coach with a five-year contract at $375,000 per year. Inheriting a one-win team from 1997, the Cardinals improved to 7‚Äì5 in 1998 and were through 2002, with five straight bowl appearances and consecutive Conference USA titles in 2000 and 2001. Under Smith's tutelage, quarterback Dave Ragone was a three-time conference player of the year (2000‚Äì02). On December 19, 2002, Smith accepted the head coaching job at Michigan State. He informed his Louisville players of the decision at halftime of the GMAC Bowl, which ended with a 38‚Äì15 loss to Marshall. Michigan State =2003= After opening his first season at Michigan State in 2003 with wins over Western Michigan and Rutgers, Smith's team was unable to hold off a series of late game drives by WAC member Louisiana Tech, losing a 20‚Äì19 decision. The Spartans ended the regular season 8‚Äì4, and were then defeated by Nebraska, 17‚Äì3, in the 2003 Alamo Bowl, a game which also featured the injury of the Spartans' anticipated star quarterback Drew Stanton while he was playing on special teams. Smith was named the Big Ten Conference Coach of the Year in 2003. =2004= The second game of the 2004 season was the second of a \\"home-and-home\\" series against Rutgers, which the Spartans lost in New Jersey, 19‚Äì14. The Spartans also lost to Notre Dame and dropped a three-overtime game against rival Michigan, but beat a top-10 ranked Wisconsin team, 49‚Äì14. The Spartans lost their final two games that season and did not receive a bowl invitation‚Äîthe first time a Smith-coached team hadn't gone to a bowl since 1997. =2005= Michigan State began the 2005 season with a 4‚Äì0 record in non-conference play including an overtime win against Notre Dame in South Bend. However, the Spartans only won two games in the Big Ten and were again unable to beat Michigan, losing 34‚Äì31 in the second straight overtime game between the two schools. One of the most significant games of the season was against Ohio State. The Spartans had a brief 17‚Äì7 lead in the second quarter. With 24 seconds and no time outs remaining in the first half, Michigan State faced a second down and 12 yards to go at the Ohio State 17 yard-line. Michigan State tried a running play resulting in no gain. Facing third down, Michigan State likely could have easily spiked the ball to stop the clock. However, with the clock running, it was perceived by many fans and sports commentators that chaos reigned on the MSU sideline. The confusion resulted in Michigan State lining up on the field with only ten players. The ensuing field goal attempt was blocked, and returned by Ohio State for a touchdown to cut the lead to 17‚Äì14. In half-time comments on ABC by Jack Arute, Smith, while raising his voice, blamed the coaching staff remarking, \\"That's a dang coaching mistake...the kids are playing their tail off, and the coaches are screwing it up!\\" Michigan State finished the season 5‚Äì6, and did not receive a bowl bid for the second straight year. =2006= Michigan State began 2006 with three wins and then suffered an infamous late-game loss against Notre Dame. The Spartans led 37‚Äì21 midway through the fourth quarter, but, despite a raging thunderstorm, the Irish rallied for a 40‚Äì37 victory. This led to a now-famous video of John L. Smith slapping himself at the post- game press conference. The following week, Michigan State's homecoming game, the Spartans were defeated 23‚Äì20 by an Illinois team that had not won a Big Ten game since 2004. After the game, players from both teams fought at midfield after several Illinois players tried to plant their flag at midfield of Spartan Stadium. In the post-game press conference, Smith admitted the coaches were having trouble motivating the players. Smith also slapped himself in the face as a reference to a claim by Notre Dame head coach Charlie Weis who stated that he had been hit in the face during a sideline scrum earlier that season when his Fighting Irish played Michigan State. Following another defeat to Michigan, Michigan State hosted and lost 38‚Äì7 to top-ranked Ohio State. At halftime, Spartan Stadium had mostly emptied, with a large portion of the remaining attendees being Ohio State fans. MSU followed up those losses with a 41‚Äì38 win at Northwestern. The Spartans, down 38‚Äì3 in the middle of the third quarter, rallied for 38 unanswered points for the largest comeback in NCAA history. The Spartans then fell to Indiana the following week. On November 1, Michigan State decided not to retain John L. Smith, and the remainder of his contract was bought out for $1.5 million. Smith and his coaching staff stayed on the job through the end of the 2006 season. Michigan State finished 4‚Äì8 (1‚Äì7 in the Big Ten). Smith was replaced by Mark Dantonio, previously the head coach of Cincinnati on November 27. Smith had a record of 22‚Äì26 (.458) in his four seasons at Michigan State. Smith has compiled a record of 132‚Äì86 (.605) in his 18 years as a college head coach. 12 of his 18 teams have participated in postseason play, including seven straight from 1997 to 2003. Smith is one of 18 head coaches in college football history to take three different teams to bowl games. A defensive coach for most of his career, Smith is also known as one of the disciples of the spread offense, learned from Dennis Erickson, which he introduced at Michigan State. Return to coaching: Arkansas After two years of broadcasting, Smith returned to the sidelines in 2009 as the special teams coach at the University of Arkansas under head coach Bobby Petrino, his former assistant.arkansasnews.com ‚Äì Smith accepts Weber State job ‚Äì December 6, 2011 ‚Äì accessed March 13, 2012 Weber State Following his third year as an assistant at Arkansas in 2011, Smith left in December to lead his fifth Division I program at Weber State, his alma mater, an FCS program in the Big Sky Conference. He succeeded Ron McBride, who retired after seven seasons with the Wildcats. Smith coached the Wildcats through spring drills in April, but left days later to replace Petrino at Arkansas, who had been recently fired. Arkansas On April 10, 2012, the University of Arkansas fired head coach Bobby Petrino. Almost immediately, there was considerable media speculation that Smith would return to Arkansas, and replace Petrino. ‚Äì April 23, 2012 This was confirmed less than two weeks after the firing of Petrino, when multiple media outlets reported that Smith would indeed return to Arkansas. He was introduced as Arkansas' 29th full-time head coach the next day. The event was a reversal of roles as it was now Smith replacing Petrino as head coach; Petrino succeeded Smith at Louisville following Smith's departure in 2003. Smith signed a 10-month contract, leading to speculation that he was only taking the post on an interim basis for the 2012 season. The Razorbacks' formal announcement described him as \\"head coach\\", without any qualifiers; however, it also indicated that Smith's hiring would allow Arkansas to hire \\"a head coach for the future of the program\\" in a more appropriate timeframe following the 2012 season. On Saturday, November 24, following a disappointing season, the university announced that Smith would not be retained as head coach, but would serve as a consultant to the team until his contract ran out in February 2013. Fort Lewis College On January 16, 2013, Smith was introduced as the head coach at Fort Lewis College, a Division II team in Durango, Colorado He took over a Skyhawks program that was 0‚Äì10 in 2012, last in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference (RMAC). In his three years at the helm, the Skyhawks went overall and in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference. Fort Lewis notched seven wins in 2015, including six in conference games (7‚Äì4, 6‚Äì3 RMAC). The last time the Skyhawks notched seven wins in a season was 2006, during Ed Rifilato's first stint as the head coach. All four losses in 2015 came at the hands of nationally ranked teams. Kentucky State University On December 7, 2015, it was announced that Smith had been hired as the head coach at Kentucky State University in Frankfort, a member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SIAC) in Division II. Personal life, family, and honors Smith married the former Diana Flora on August 15, 1970, and they have three children: Nicholas, Kayse, and Sam. He is the uncle of Washington Redskins quarterback Alex Smith. Smith has earned a reputation for his adventurous attitude and actions, including para-gliding with his children in Zermatt, Switzerland, climbing 19,340-foot Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, flying in a T-38 Talon jet trainer in Texas at Randolph Air Force Base, skydiving from 14,000 feet over Greensburg, Indiana, and running with the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. In 2000 Sports Illustrated recognized Smith as one of Idaho's top 100 athletes of the 20th century. He was later inducted into the Idaho Athletics Hall of Fame in 2001. Smith filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection on September 6, 2012. Smith said he began land investments when he was coach at Louisville from 1998 to 2002, and that he and other investors lost money when the real estate market softened.Arkansas coach John L.

At some underage grades Milltown, along with Allenwood, Ballyteague & Robertstown, form part of the highly successful combined Parish of Allen club, Na Fianna. Milltown have been affiliated to the GAA since 1888, and have affiliated each year since. This makes it the oldest club still in continuous existence in County Kildare. Adding to their history, the Milltown U21s team were the first 21s team of Milltown to win a Championship Title in November 2017.

The song is historically performed in the country-blues style from the viewpoint of the prisoner and has been covered by many artists. History Lead Belly, photographed by Alan Lomax in the 1940s. Lyrics appearing in the song were first recorded in print by Howard Odum in 1905:Oliver, Songster and Saints, p. 247: \\"An example of this form of nodal ballad is The Midnight Special, a prison song known in penitentiaries in many parts of the South. One stanza fragment which relates to the song was noted by Howard Odum about 1905 and published in his 1911 collection.\\" However, these lyrics are known to be floater lines, appearing in various African-American songs of that period, notably in the \\"Grade-Songs\\", which are about prison captains and have nothing to do with a train or a light.Howard Odom, \\"Folk-Song and Folk-Poetry As Found in the Secular Songs of the Southern Negroes\\", in Journal of American Folk-Lore, Ed. Franz Boaz, Vol. 24, no. 94, p. 382, 1911. The first printed reference to the song itself was in a 1923 issue of Adventure magazine, a three-times-a-month pulp magazine published by the Ridgway Company.Cohen, Long Steel Rail, p 479: \\"The earliest reference to the song I have found was in a letter to Robert W. Gordon, conducting the column 'Old Songs That Men Have Sung' in Adventure magazine. Dated August 3, 1923, the requested additional verses ...\\" In 1927 Carl Sandburg published two different versions of \\"Midnight Special\\" in his The American Songbag, the first published versions.Cohen, Long Steel Rail, p 479: \\"Carl Sandburg published two variants in his 1927 anthology, American Songbag, both without attribution.\\" The song was first commercially recorded on the OKeh label in 1926 as \\"Pistol Pete's Midnight Special\\" by Dave \\"Pistol Pete\\" Cutrell (a member of McGinty's Oklahoma Cow Boy Band).Russel, Country Music Records, p. 240: \\"Dave Cutrell; St. Louis, MO; May 1926; 9650-A; 'Pistol Pete's Midnight Special'; Despite the label credit to McGint'y Oklahoma Cow Boy Band as accompanists, the instrumentation is as shown. Rev. Okeh 45057 by McGinty's Oklahoma Cow Boy Band ...\\" Cutrell follows the traditional song except for semi-comedic stanzas about McGinty and Gray and \\"a cowboy band\\":Cutrell, \\"Pistol Pete's Midnight Special\\", British Archive of Country Music. In March 1929, the band, now Otto Gray and the Oklahoma Cowboys, recorded the song again, this time with the traditional title using only the traditional lyrics.Waltz, The Traditional Ballad Index: \\"McGinty's Oklahoma Cowboy Band (now led by Otto Gray), \\"The Midnight Special\\" (Vocalion 5337; c. 1929).\\" Sam Collins recorded the song commercially in 1927 under the title \\"The Midnight Special Blues\\" for Gennett Records.Discography of Sam Collins (musician) by Stefan Wirz. His version also follows the traditional style. His is the first to name the woman in the story, Little Nora, and he refers to the Midnight Special's \\"ever-living\\" light: In 1934 Huddie William \\"Lead Belly\\" Ledbetter recorded a version of the song at Angola Prison for John and Alan Lomax, who mistakenly attributed it to him as the author. However, Ledbetter, for his Angola session, appears to have inserted several stanzas relating to a 1923 Houston jailbreak into the traditional song.Cohen, Long Steel Rail, p. 480: \\"McCormick's researchers do not prove that the song \\"The Midnight Special\\" originated at the time of this 1923 jailbreak. It seems more probable that Lead Belly and others set the details of that event into the framework of an earlier, well-established traditional song. The strongest evidence for this assumption is that the song appeared widely throughout the South within a very few years after 1923, and invariably in versions that did not mention any of the individual associated with the Houston events of 1923.\\" Ledbetter recorded at least three versions of the song, one with the Golden Gate Quartet, a gospel group (recorded for RCA at Victor Studio #2, New York City, June 15, 1940). John and Alan Lomax, in their book, Best Loved American Folk Songs, told a credible story identifying the Midnight Special as a train from Houston shining its light into a cell in the Sugar Land Prison. They also describe Ledbetter's version as \\"the Negro jailbird's ballad to match Hard Times Poor Boy. Like so many American folk songs, its hero is not a man but a train.\\" The light of the train is seen as the light of salvation, the train which could take them away from the prison walls. It is highly reminiscent of the imagery of such gospel songs as Let the Light from your Lighthouse Shine on Me. Carl Sandburg had a different view. He believed the subject of the song would rather be run over by a train than spend more time in jail.Waltz, The Traditional Ballad Index: \\"Carl Sandburg, on the other hand, believes that the song refers to suicide: That the convict would rather be dead under the wheels of the train than spend another twenty years in prison.\\" The song, as popularized by Ledbetter, has many parallel lines to other prison songs. It is essentially the same song as \\"De Funiac Blues,\\" sung and played by Burruss Johnson and recorded by John Lomax at the Raiford State Penitentiary in Florida on 2 June 1939. Many of the lines appear in prison work songs such as \\"Jumpin Judy,\\" \\"Ain't That Berta,\\" \\"Oh Berta\\" and \\"Yon' Comes de Sargent.\\" These songs, including Ledbetter's \\"Midnight Special\\" are composite. They mix standard prison song verses indiscriminately. Many of these component pieces have become canonized in the blues idiom and appear in mutated forms regularly in blues lyrics. Although later versions place the locale of the song near Houston, early versions such as \\"Walk Right In Belmont\\" (Wilmer Watts; Frank Wilson, 1927) and \\"North Carolina Blues\\" (Roy Martin, 1930) ‚Äî both essentially the same song as \\"Midnight Special\\" ‚Äî place it in North Carolina.Cohen, Long Steel Rail, p 479: One version, collected from prisoners at the state prison at Parchman, Mississippi, has this chorus: \\"Let the Midnight Special shine her light on me, You take the Illinois Central, and come to Kankakee\\" Most of the early versions, however, have no particular location. Only one recording, collected by the Lomaxes at the Mississippi State Penitentiary, actually identifies the railroad operating the Midnight Special ‚Äî the Illinois Central which had a route through Mississippi. Other versions Creedence Clearwater Revival, whose version of the song appeared on their album Willy and the Poor Boys (1969). Folk/bluegrass musicians Wilma Lee and Stoney Cooper had a top 5 country hit with the song in 1959 as \\"Big Midnight Special\\". Only two versions of the song have reached the US Billboard Hot 100. Paul Evans recorded the highest-charting version of \\"Midnight Special,\\" reaching number 16 in the winter of 1960. Five years later, Johnny Rivers' version reached number 20 in 1965. The Johnny Rivers version was used as the theme for the NBC music program The Midnight Special. Lead Belly, Big Bill Broonzy, Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee, Odetta, Les Paul, The Kingston Trio (who also recorded their song \\"The Tijuana Jail\\", which retains the same music but with new lyrics), Pete Seeger, Peter, Paul and Mary, Burl Ives, Big Joe Turner, Bobby Darin, Cisco Houston, Jimmy Smith, Mungo Jerry, Van Morrison, Little Richard, Buckwheat Zydeco, Otis Rush, The Spencer Davis Group, Lonnie Donegan, Eric Clapton, The Louvin Brothers, Long John Baldry, The Kentucky Headhunters, Willie Watson, Mischief Brew, Hoyt Axton and Creedence Clearwater Revival, among others, have recorded the song. Jody Miller arranged her own version and included it on her first album Wednesday's Child is Full of Woe in 1963. Harry Belafonte's 1962 version is notable for containing the first official recording of Bob Dylan, who played harmonica. Paul McCartney has performed it numerous times. It was the closing song on his 1988 album CHOBA B CCCP and was performed on his 1991 appearance on MTV Unplugged, but was not included on the accompanying album. ABBA recorded the song in 1975 for charity, as a part of a folk medley, along with \\"Pick a Bale of Cotton\\" and \\"On Top of Old Smokey\\". It was the B-side to their 1978 single \\"Summer Night City\\". The medley represents the group's only recording of material not written by Benny Andersson and Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus after their breakthrough with \\"Ring Ring\\" in 1973.Companion book to Thank You For the Music Boxed Set, Polydor 1992, Cat.-No. 314 523 472-2 Dylan references a line from the song ‚Äî \\"Shine your light on me\\" ‚Äî on the second track, \\"Precious Angel\\", of his 1979 gospel album Slow Train Coming.

He spent most of his 13-season playing career with the Cleveland Spiders, and went on to manage the Cleveland Blues, St. Louis Browns, and Washington Senators. Shortly before his retirement, he became a major shareholder in the Boston Red Sox. His career ended abruptly. During his brief tenure as co-owner of the Red Sox, McAleer quarreled with longtime friend and colleague Ban Johnson, president of the American League. In the wake of this disagreement, he sold off his shares in the Red Sox and broke off his relationship with Major League Baseball. McAleer's rift with Johnson, along with his sudden retirement, damaged his professional reputation, and he received little recognition for his contributions to baseball. Today, he is most often remembered for initiating the customary request that the President of the United States throw out the first ball of the season. Early years McAleer on a baseball card c. 1887 McAleer was born in Youngstown, Ohio, an industrial center located near the border of western Pennsylvania. His father, Owen McAleer, died at a young age, leaving McAleer's mother, Mary, to support three children. The family lived on the city's west side, where the McAleer children were raised to value the concept of formal education. McAleer attended local public schools and graduated from Rayen High School. In later years, all three of the McAleer brothers moved on to successful careers, and the oldest, Owen McAleer, Jr., served for a time as mayor of Los Angeles. A \\"strapping six-foot 175-pound outfielder,\\" McAleer won early recognition for his physical speed. He became involved with a Youngstown minor league baseball club in 1882, remaining with the team until 1884. In 1885, McAleer joined another minor league organization in Charleston, South Carolina; and in 1887, he played for a team based in Memphis, Tennessee. His skill as a center fielder was recognized in 1888, while he was playing for a club in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Although his primary focus was organized sports, McAleer was also drawn to the field of entertainment. During one season of his minor league career, he became part-owner of the DeHaven Comedy Company, a theatrical road troupe that was organized in Youngstown. His interest in show business remained a constant, and in later years McAleer developed a strong friendship with Broadway composer and performer George M. Cohan. Playing career On April 24, 1889, McAleer broke into the Major Leagues in Cleveland, Ohio, where he established a reputation as a graceful outfielder.Dewey and Acocella (2005), p. 220. In 1891, when Patsy Tebeau became manager of the Cleveland Spiders, the club became known for its aggressive tactics. Tebeau encouraged players to block and hold runners, while he himself openly challenged and harassed officials. In 1896, the Cleveland manager was jailed for attacking an umpire who \\"decided it was too dark to continue a game\\". On June 27, 1896, McAleer was among several Cleveland players to be fined by a Louisville (Kentucky) judge for their role in the incident. Later that year, the club's notoriety prompted other National League teams to propose a boycott of Cleveland, \\"until the Spiders mended their ways.\\" McAleer's periodic displays of temper were in keeping with this rowdy environment. During an August 18, 1891 game with the Cincinnati Reds, Reds player Arlie Latham tripped McAleer as he rounded third base; McAleer responded by chasing Latham around the field, while brandishing his bat. At the same time, McAleer proved a strong performer. A later newspaper account described him as an outstanding outfielder who was \\"blessed with excellent speed\\". The article noted that McAleer's skills as a sprinter helped him steal 51 bases in one year and 41 in another. According to some accounts, he was \\"the first centerfielder to take his eyes off a fly ball, run to the spot where it fell to earth, and catch it\\". Less proficient as a hitter, McAleer accumulated a lifetime batting average of .253. During his career, the league's batting (pitchers removed) average for players with the same home field was .284. On April 24, 1894, he assisted in Cleveland's 1‚Äì0 victory over Cincinnati with a single in the ninth that drove home Buck Ewing, who had doubled. Along with teammates Cy Young, Jesse Burkett, John Clarkson, and Charles Zimmer, McAleer also participated in the Spiders' victory over the Baltimore Orioles in the 1895 Temple Cup, a post-season series between first and second-place teams of the National League. The Spiders placed second to the Orioles at the close of both the 1895 and 1896 seasons. McAleer's performance came in spite of a serious injury he received during a game held in Philadelphia on August 24, 1895, when he collided with a fence. Furthermore, he balanced his achievements in sports with a foray into politics in his hometown of Youngstown. During the summer of 1895, McAleer was promoted in the local media as a mayoral candidate, first as a Republican, and then as an independent. In 1898, when the Spiders' owners purchased the St. Louis Browns franchise, McAleer opted to stay in Cleveland, taking a brief hiatus from baseball until the Cleveland Blues franchise joined the newly formed American League (AL). During his two-year absence, the Spiders lost many of their more experienced players.Okrent and Wulf (1989), pp. 36‚Äì37. In 1899, the team won 20 games and lost 134, which is still percentage-wise the worst season record in Major League history. As baseball historian Bill James noted, the Spiders were forced to cancel home games due to poor attendance and \\"turned the last two months of the season into a long road trip\\".James (2001), p. 57. After a full year out of baseball in 1899, McAleer was back in a Cleveland uniform in 1900, in a new league, as player- manager of the Cleveland Lake Shores of the fledgling American League, then a minor league. McAleer's subsequent career as a major league manager (1901‚Äì11) overlapped with his playing career (1882‚Äì1907). Although he did not play professionally between 1903 and 1906, McAleer played in his last Major League game on July 8, 1907. Managing career Cleveland Lake Shores/Blues In 1900, McAleer became player-manager of the Cleveland Lake Shores (a predecessor of the Cleveland Indians) and continued with the franchise in 1901, when the American League became a major league and the club was renamed as the Blues,Dewey and Acocella (2005), p. 224. a name borrowed from a team that had participated in the National League during the 1870s and 1880s.Dewey and Acocella (2005), p. 219. The Blues made their major league debut on April 24, 1901, with an 8‚Äì2 loss to the Chicago White Sox. Two other league games were canceled due to inclement weather, and the contest between the Blues and White Sox served as the inaugural game of the AL. In July of that year, McAleer presided over the Blues' upset 6‚Äì1 loss to the Detroit Tigers. Although the Tigers' manager, Tommy Burns, agreed to forfeit the game for fear that the umpire, Joe Cantillon, would be injured by an angry crowd, McAleer agreed to play the Tigers using a reserve umpire. The Blues eventually closed the season with a 54‚Äì82 record, placing seventh in the eight-team American League. McAleer, however, contributed little to this outcome. In 1901, he played in only three games with the Blues. The AL, established in 1900 by Ban Johnson, former president of the Western League, was by this time in direct competition with the well-established National League (NL). McAleer, a close friend of Johnson and his associate, Charles Comiskey, played a significant role in the new league's development, recruiting scores of experienced players from the NL. St. Louis Browns McAleer in 1905 As manager of the Browns, McAleer lured players such as Hall of Famers Jesse Burkett and Bobby Wallace. In 1902, the Browns took second place in the league, with a record of 78 wins and 58 losses.Dewey and Acocella (2005), p. 554. Between 1903 and 1907, however, the team never ranked higher than fifth or sixth place in the AL. Then, in 1908, the club rebounded, finishing just six-and-a-half games out of first place, with a record of 83 wins and 69 losses, landing at fourth in the AL. The Browns ended the 1909 season, however, with a record of 61‚Äì89, earning seventh place. McAleer was fired at the close of the season. Browns owner Robert L. Hedges, a Cincinnati carriage maker, replaced the \\"affable\\" McAleer with the \\"crustier\\" Jack O'Connor, who was expelled from the league in 1910 for seeking to influence the outcome of the annual batting championship. Washington Senators On September 22, 1909, McAleer went on to manage the Washington Senators (popularly known as the \\"Nationals\\"), a team that had ceased to be competitive since the death of star hitter Ed Delahanty six years earlier.Casway (2004), pp. 269‚Äì282.Dewey and Acocella (2005), pp. 628‚Äì629. The team fared little better under McAleer's management, finishing with a lackluster 66‚Äì85 record (seventh place) at the close of the 1910 season.Dewey and Acocella (2005), p. 630. The high point of the season was a game in which McAleer initiated what became a baseball tradition. On April 14, 1910, he asked visiting President William Howard Taft to throw out the first ball of a season opener. President Taft, an ardent fan of the game, readily agreed.Nemec and Wisnia (2000), p. 42. Baseball historians Donald Dewey and Nicholas Acocella noted that the game \\"almost put an end to the career\\" of U.S. Vice President James S. Sherman, who \\"took a foul ball off the bat of Frank Baker directly in the head\\". This contest also featured a one-hit performance by pitcher Walter Johnson, who led the Senators to a 3‚Äì0 victory over the Philadelphia Athletics.Neft, Cohen, and Neft (2003), p. 48. Executive career Boston Red Sox Toward the close of the 1911 season, McAleer announced his resignation as manager of the Senators. In 1912, he became a major stockholder in the Boston Red Sox, purchasing a half-interest in the team. That year, the Red Sox \\"cruised to the pennant with 105 victories\\". Red Sox as 1912 champions By the time the Red Sox entered the sixth game of the 1912 World Series, the team had secured a 3‚Äì1 lead over the New York Giants. (The second game of the Series ended in a tie.) Then, McAleer pressured the team's manager, Jake Stahl, to hand the ball to unseasoned pitcher Buck O'Brien for the \\"clincher\\". McAleer's recommendation was apparently part of a strategy to ensure that the seventh game of the Series would be played at Boston's new Fenway Park. Although the Red Sox's loss to the Giants (at 5‚Äì2) guaranteed that the Series would conclude in Boston, the incident created conflict between McAleer and Stahl. Subsequent press releases suggesting that Stahl would replace McAleer as club president exacerbated these tensions.Dewey and Acocella (2005), p. 74‚Äì75. In the seventh game of the Series, the Red Sox opened Fenway Park with a 7‚Äì6 victory over the Giants.Walton (1980), p. 201. The team suffered a public relations fiasco, however, when a Red Sox shareholder sold seats at the stadium that had been reserved for the club's most ardent fans, the \\"Royal Rooters\\".Dewey and Acocella (2005), p. 74. Finding themselves without seats, the Royal Rooters, led by Boston Mayor John \\"Honey Fitz\\" Fitzgerald, marched around the stadium in protest. A riot ensued, and in the aftermath of the disturbance, only 17,000 Boston residents showed up for the final game. Nevertheless, the Red Sox emerged as victors, with a final score of 4‚Äì3 and one tied game.Neft, Cohen, and Neft (2003), pp. 56‚Äì59. Following the Series victory over the Giants, McAleer returned to his hometown to celebrate the event. A brass band met him at Youngstown's train depot, and a parade and fireworks display were held in his honor. The Youngstown Daily Vindicator reported: \\"As the auto bearing Mr. McAleer turned into West Federal Street, hundreds of sticks of red fire were burning at Central Square, while the quiet atmosphere was occasionally punctured by the explosion of a bomb\\". Downfall McAleer's tenure as part-owner of the Red Sox came to a swift end. On July 15, 1913, McAleer became involved in a dispute with the AL president, Ban Johnson, when McAleer forced the resignation of Red Sox manager Jake Stahl, one of Johnson's closest friends. While McAleer claimed that he released Stahl because of a foot injury preventing Stahl from serving as a player-manager, rumors suggested that the two men had strong personal differences. Following a bitter quarrel with Johnson, McAleer sold his holdings in the Red Sox. His feud with Johnson turned out to be a lifelong affair, despite efforts taken by their mutual friend, Charles Comiskey, to smooth over the rift. While McAleer never publicly discussed the disagreement that spurred his retirement, he supposedly relayed his version of events to Frank B. Ward, a sports reporter with The Youngstown Daily Vindicator, with the understanding that the details remain confidential until McAleer's death. Ban Johnson in 1905 Although other sources tell a different story, Ward wrote that McAleer termed his \\"break\\" with Johnson as the result of a \\"betrayal\\" of trust. McAleer indicated that his controlling interest in the Red Sox entitled him to make all major decisions regarding the organization, Ward wrote. This view of McAleer's powers, however, was not shared by the club's manager, Stahl, the article added. To further complicate matters, Stahl's father-in- law, a Chicago-based banker, was reportedly a shareholder in the Red Sox. After one particularly heated exchange between Stahl and McAleer at the close of the 1912 season, Stahl went to Chicago to confer with Johnson. The article indicated that, after this meeting, Johnson sent McAleer a \\"sternly worded\\" letter, which may have been designed to preserve his relationship with Stahl and Stahl's father-in-law. According to the article, Johnson later confided to McAleer that he owed Stahl's father-in-law money and therefore felt obliged to take Stahl's side in the dispute. McAleer, however, took the admonition from Johnson as a betrayal of their friendship, refused to accept Johnson's explanations, and promptly retired, Ward wrote. This version of events is largely corroborated by the early research of baseball historian David Fleitz. Baseball historians Dewey and Acocella, however, described a markedly different scenario in which Johnson secretly sold off McAleer's shares while McAleer was away on a 1913 world tour with Comiskey, New York Giants manager John McGraw, and members of the Red Sox team. According to this account, McAleer's conflict with Stahl was followed up by his involvement in a feud between two pairs of players ‚Äì Tris Speaker and Joe \\"Smoky Joe\\" Wood, on one side, and Heinie Wagner and Bill Carrigan, on the other. The conflict had a \\"religious dimension\\" and was described in the press as \\"pitting Masons against members of the Knights of Columbus\\". McAleer evidently supported Wagner and Carrigan, the Catholic players in the dispute. These back-to-back incidents involving individuals associated with the Red Sox team \\"reinforced Johnson's belief that the club president was the source of all the trouble\\", Dewey and Acocella wrote. In his recent book, The Irish in Baseball, David Fleitz observed that McAleer's abrupt dismissal was typical of Johnson, \\"who had a history of ending relationships when they no longer benefited him personally\\".Fleitz (2009), p. 174. Personal life Relatively little is known about McAleer's private life. Research suggests that he was married three times, with his first marriage (to Hannah McAleer) taking place in the early 20th century. At some point, he married the former Anna Durbin, a native of Trenton, New Jersey. The couple had no children. According to her obituary, Anna McAleer was her husband's \\"constant companion\\" during his \\"active career as a baseball magnate\\". When the couple settled in Youngstown in 1913, she participated in charity work and joined the Altar and Rosary Society at St. Columba's Church, where she attended religious services. In 1930, Anna McAleer died suddenly at an apartment the couple shared on the north side of Youngstown. James McAleer, who discovered his wife's body after returning from a walk, was \\"overcome\\". McAleer had recently been released from a local hospital following an appendicectomy; he was quickly readmitted following his wife's death. A few months later, McAleer married a Youngstown woman, Georgianna Rudge, a graduate of the Juilliard School of Music who was almost 23 years her husband's junior. Ultimately, Georgianna McAleer survived her husband by more than five decades. By the time of James McAleer's second marriage, his health was in decline. He was hospitalized within a few months of the wedding. Final years Youngstown, Ohio (1910s) McAleer returned to Youngstown, where he spent his last years. Active in the community, McAleer served on the city's original draft board, which had been authorized under Ohio Governor James M. Cox during World War I. In retirement, the former baseball manager maintained friendships with celebrities including George M. Cohan and King Alfonso XIII of Spain. McAleer became acquainted with the Spanish monarch during a European tour with the Red Sox in the winter of 1912‚Äì13. His final years were marked by poor health. Several weeks before his death, McAleer was admitted to a local hospital, where his health reportedly improved. This account, however, differs from that of baseball historian David Fleitz, who suggested that McAleer had been diagnosed with cancer in the early 1930s. In any event, McAleer died suddenly on April 29, 1931, shortly after being released from the hospital. He was 66 years old. After private funeral services at Orr's funeral home, McAleer's remains were interred at Oak Hill Cemetery, on Youngstown's near south side. Apart from his widow, he left behind two brothers, J.C. McAleer of Austintown, Ohio, and Owen McAleer of Los Angeles. Other survivors included two nephews, Captain Charlies McAleer, an officer in the U.S. Army, and James McAleer of Los Angeles. Rumors persist that McAleer's death was the result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. While his name is included on some lists of Major League Baseball players who committed suicide, contemporary newspaper accounts indicated that McAleer died of natural causes. Legacy James R. McAleer in 1909 McAleer's hometown newspaper, The Youngstown Daily Vindicator, eulogized the ex-Major Leaguer in the following terms: \\"Forceful and resourceful, but always retiring when there was talk of his share in the development of baseball, James R. McAleer died within a matter of weeks after the passing of Byron Bancroft Johnson, his chief partner in the forming of the American League, and the man with whom he 'broke', which break brought about his retirement\\". The article praised McAleer for assisting the careers of other baseball figures. In 1905, during his tenure as manager of the St. Louis Browns, McAleer helped future Hall of Fame umpire Billy Evans secure a position with the American League, writing a personal letter to Johnson on Evans' behalf. Meanwhile, McAleer served as a contact for another Youngstown resident, John \\"Bonesetter\\" Reese, the Welsh-born \\"baseball doctor\\"Strickland (1984), pp. 140‚Äì141. who worked with players such as Cy Young, Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, Walter Johnson, and John McGraw. McAleer's contributions to the game failed to win him a place in the Baseball Hall of Fame, however. In 1936, during the first elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame, he received just one vote in the balloting for 19th- century figures. Nevertheless, McAleer received an unofficial endorsement from Hall of Fame second baseman Nap Lajoie, who described McAleer as \\"one of the best ever\\". McAleer's obituary in The New York Times suggested that he was \\"one of the fastest outfielders the major leagues ever produced\\". In 2003, Bill James described McAleer as \\"the best defensive outfielder of the 1890s\\".James (2003), p. 764. More recently, baseball historian David Fleitz observed, \\"this brilliant defensive outfielder was a smart, clever, and ambitious man who helped to create two of the original eight franchises of the American League\\".

It covers 9,459 acres (38.3 km2), primarily swamps, bogs, and upland \\"islands\\". The park was started by local grassroots efforts in 2002, it became a state recreation area and officially opened in June 2006. The \\"Big Bog\\" is composed mostly of wetlands. The name was not widely used but had shown up previously in maps, such as by the National Geographic Society. The greater Big Bog region stretches from jackpine forests north of Upper Red Lake in Beltrami County, Minnesota and Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota to the communities along U.S. Route 71 leading to International Falls (Mizpah, Gemmell, Margie, Big Falls, and Littlefork) in Koochiching County, Minnesota. This includes much of the Pine Island State Forest and two National Natural Areas: Upper Red Lake Peatland, and the Lost River Peatland. It is also almost entirely unpopulated, except for the town of Waskish along Highway 72. Flora and Fauna Common trees include tamarack, tag alder, cedar, diamond willow, black and white spruce, jackpine, and green ash and black ash with paper birch, \\"popple\\" or quaking aspen, white and red pines in the uplands. There are numerous rare plants, including carnivorous sundews and pitcher plants. Animals include bald eagles, timber wolves, black bears, white-tailed deer, and moose. History The Big Bog sits on the southeast side of glacial Lake Agassiz, formed during the last ice age. This former lake bottom is quite flat, with occasional hills of gravel deposits or rock. As the lake drained, this area slowly filled in with wetland plants and animals. The Anishinaabe gathered blueberries, fished, and hunted game here until the late 19th century. In the 1920s and 1930s virtually all areas in the vicinity had their majestic old growth pine trees cut down as a massive logging effort swept through, but because of the swampy nature and lack of large stands of mature pines, the Big Bog area was relatively untouched. (Also see the Lost Forty in the Chippewa National Forest). Some efforts have been made to drain portions or harvest the peat, but met with little success. Scattered communities of mixed farming were relocated from some of the more remote areas during rural reform as part of the Rural Electrification Act during the 1930s and 1940s. The fishing-dependent community suffered after a disastrous fall in walleyed pike or walleye (Sander vitreus) population in both basins of Upper and Lower Red Lakes during the 1990s. In 2002 members of the Upper Red Lake Area Association pushed the idea of a new state park, soon after nearly 10,000 acres (40 km2) were classified as the Big Bog State Recreation Area. Bog Walk Boardwalk in the Big Bog State Recreation Area, near Waskish, Minnesota A recent addition to the Big Bog State Recreation Area is a raised boardwalk across the bog which allows visitors to explore one mile (1.6 km) into the \\"islands\\" of spruce within the bog, as well as the open wetlands. The boardwalk was designed to allow up to 37% of natural sunlight to fall through, allowing delicate bog plants to continue to grow under the walkway. Numerous signs identify aspects of the bog, including pitcher plants and an early failed attempt at draining the swamp lands. A parking pass needs to be purchased at the nature center nine miles south, on the northern side of the town of Waskish.  Natural Landmark designation  The greater Big Bog area includes the Upper Red Lake Peatland, a National Natural Landmark under the Historic Sites Act. It received this designation in May 1975 from the United States Secretary of the Interior, giving it recognition as an outstanding example of the nation's natural history. The designation describes it as > One of the largest peatlands remaining in the conterminous United States, > illustrating a variety of geological features and plant associations, > especially the dominant and rare string bog. An outstanding habitat for > wildlife including endangered species. Also included in the greater Big Bog area is the Lost River Peatland, a designated Scientific and Natural Area for the state of Minnesota. It was designated in 1991. It is also an Audubon Important Bird Area, and contains the largest number of rare plant species of any peatland in Minnesota.

Affectionately called ThAyAr (\\"Holy Mother\\" in Tamil), she is the consort of Lord Ranganatha, the male deity of Srirangam. She is regarded as the manifestation of Lakshmi. She is also called Ranga NAchiAr and Periya Piratti. Ranganayaki is held in high reverence by the people of Srirangam and by Vaishnavites. Acharyas that sang the grace of Ranganatha venerate her. She is the feminine aspect of the universe and Vaishnavite traditions regard her co- equal to Ranganatha himself; she is both the means and the end of worship to them.All Vaishanvites revere her as ThAyAr. Temple As with Hindu tradition, the shrine has both a Moolavar and an Uthsavar (presiding deity). Unlike other temples, the Uthsavar of Thayar never leaves her sannathi (shrine). It is a temple custom that the goddess of the temple takes her place beside the god of the temple during processions. In Srirangam, however, Thayar never leaves her shrine. All others, including Ranganatha himself, come to see her. Once a year, in the month of Panguni Uthiram, the day in the Tamil month of Panguni when the star Uthiram is in ascension, Dhivyadhampathigal, the divine couple (Lord Azhagiya Manavalan and Thayar), come together for a day. (This day is not fixed, but falls sometime in the Western months of March or April.) This Darshan is called \\"SErthi SEvai.\\" In Tamil, SErthi is alongside/together and SEvai is Darshan. Unlike many temples, Srirangam does not have a Thirukkalyana uthsavam, The Marriage Festival, between Namperumal and ThAyAr. They are regarded as Divyadhampathigal (divine couple), existing beyond mortal confines or limitations. In the Srirangam Ranganatha Swamy temple, along with the goddess Ranganayaki, one can also find, just behind her, Bhudevi and Sridevi, in sitting posture. There are many Shlokas composed about the goddess Mahalakshmi but the \\"Sri Gunaratna Kosam,\\" a Sanskrit Shloka composed by Parasara Bhattar, is exclusive to Sri Ranganayaki. However the traditional Lakshmi Astothram is recited in the temple during rituals. Apart from this, Sree Sthuthi composed by Vedanta Desika and Kanaka dhara Sthothram given by Adi Shankaracharya are chanted by devotees of the temple. All Acharyas of Hindu tradition, irrespective of their philosophical positions, have visited and continue to visit the Srirangam to pay their homage to Ranganatha and ThAyAr.

Tarnas' second book, Prometheus the Awakener, published in 1995, focuses on the astrological properties of the planet Uranus, describing \\"the uncanny way astrological patterns appear to coincide with events or destiny patterns in the lives of both individuals and societies\\".Ray Grasse, untitled book review, Quest Winter 1995 Tarnas suggests that the characteristics associated with the mythological figure Uranus do not match the astrological properties of the planet Uranus, and that a more appropriate identification would involve the mythological figure Prometheus. In 2006, Tarnas published his third book, Cosmos and Psyche: Intimations of a New World View.

The highway extends from the intersection of U.S. Route 130 (US 130) and Route 140 in Carneys Point Township to Harding Highway (US 40) in Buena Vista Township. Mile markers on CR 540 continue from Route 140's mileage, which would indicate a short concurrency with Route 140 to that road's western terminus at US 130, while posted signage indicates CR 540's western terminus is at Route 140's eastern terminus at US 40. Route description View west along CR 540 at CR 723 in Hopewell Township The first of CR 540 are concurrent with the entire length of Route 140, running southeast through commercial areas of Carneys Point Township from an intersection with US 130 and interchanging with I-295 and the New Jersey Turnpike/US 40 at the point US 40 splits from the New Jersey Turnpike. From the east end of Route 140, signage for CR 540 begins past US 40, with the route heading southeast on two-lane undivided Hawks Bridge Road. The road runs through residential neighborhoods before crossing the Salem River into Mannington Township. The route intersects CR 631 as it heads through forests before entering a mix of woods and farms as the road turns south and briefly becomes a divided highway at the CR 646 junction. From here, CR 540 becomes Pointers Road and runs through more agricultural areas, crossing the marshy Mannington Creek before briefly turning southeast onto Bypass Road and intersecting CR 620 and Route 45. Here, CR 540 turns to the east and forms a concurrency with Route 45, passing some homes before heading into farm fields with occasional residences. CR 540 splits from Route 45 by heading southeast on Welchville Road and passing through more farmland, crossing CR 653. After an intersection with CR 676, the road turns south-southeast into Alloway Township and crosses the Southern Railroad of New Jersey's Salem Branch line, entering more wooded areas with some farms. The route intersects CR 664 and CR 657 before crossing the Alloway Creek into the residential community of Alloway, where it heads south and comes to junctions with CR 581 and CR 640. From here, CR 540 heads southeast into more forested areas with occasional homes, entering Quinton Township. Upon coming to an intersection with CR 647 and CR 667, the route turns east onto Harmons Mill-Cohansey Road and enters agricultural areas, crossing back into Alloway Township and crossing CR 635. A short distance later, the route enters Hopewell Township in Cumberland County and becomes Deerfield Road as it comes to intersections with CR 721 and CR 723. The road enters Upper Deerfield Township in wooded areas before passing more farms as the route crosses CR 663 and Route 77. CR 540 continues northeast and crosses CR 677, at which point the road heads into a mix of farmland and woodland, intersecting CR 612, CR 711, and CR 687. CR 540 westbound past CR 645 in Pittsgrove Township The route continues into Pittsgrove Township, Salem County and becomes Centerton Road and forms a concurrency with CR 553 as the road passes near Centerton Pond in wooded areas.

It was built in 1998 as part of Sydney Olympic Park sporting complex, having held matches for the field hockey events at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Its current capacity is 8,000 people, with seating capacity for 4,000. For the Sydney Olympic Games capacity was boosted to 15,000 through the use of temporary stands. Usage Sydney Olympic Park Hockey Centre during the 2000 Summer Olympics The Sydney Olympic Park Hockey Centre is a premier field hockey facility, with the governing body of hockey in New South Wales, Hockey NSW being based there. The Sydney representatives of both the male and female versions of the semi professional Australian Hockey League, the New South Wales Waratahs and the New South Wales Arrows both play their home games at the stadium. The stadium also hosted the field hockey at the 2000 Summer Olympics, in which the Kookaburras, the men's Australian national hockey team, won the bronze medal, and the Hockeyroos, the woman's Australian national hockey team won the gold medal for the third consecutive time. At the Sydney Paralympic games in 2000, the Paralympic football 5 and 7-a-side games were played at the stadium. Other sports such as gridiron, touch football, Oztag and lacrosse have all been played at the stadium. The stadium has also been hired out by schools who require such a facility. Facilities The stadium contains two fields, one for warm-ups with the other for actual competition. The surface of both these fields, resurfaced in 2008, are POLIGRAS Olympia 2008 which contain polyethylene yarn for improved durability, UV stability, optimum ball/surface interaction and significantly less water requirements. POLIGRAS uses 100% recycled rubber for the elastic layers and heavy-metal-free yarns for the playing surface and uses 30-40% less water than other surfaces available on the market at the time. The pitch is 91.44 metres long by 54.86 metres wide. The main grandstand was designed by architects Ancher Mortlock Wooley and has seating for 1,500 people. It has a roof resembling a soaring glider or sail that sits 25 metres above the ground. It is held up by a 41m high mast removing any requirement for columns, a design that gives spectators an uninterrupted view of the action on the pitch. Other facilities available at the stadium include a conference room (Waratah) overlooking the Olympic Pitch, and the Eva Redfern Lounge (overlooking Pitch 2) also available for hire. The Olympic pitch also has a series of team changerooms, FA room, tournament and drug testing rooms. A kiosk and retail outlet are open during competition and tournament events. Being part of the Sydney Olympic Park sporting complex, it shares many other facilities with the rest of the complex and makes it easily accessible by bus, train, ferry and car.

It was incorporated on March 25, 1884. J.S. Emery was listed as the railroad's president, for which present day Emeryville is named. On March 1, 1885 the track was completed between Oakland and San Pablo via Emeryville. The track to Oak Grove (present day El Sobrante) was completed on January 1, 1887. California & Mt. Diablo Railroad DeLaveaga station, the sole extant C&N; station, is preserved in downtown Orinda The first of the California & Nevada was built by its predecessor, the California & Mt. Diablo Railroad. The California & Mt. Diablo Railroad was organized on March 21, 1881 at Emery's, an unincorporated settlement which later became the city of Emeryville. The narrow gauge track commenced at 40th Street/San Pablo Avenue and continued north through present day Berkeley, Albany, El Cerrito and terminated in Richmond. The California & Mt. Diablo Railroad proposed to run from a pier on San Francisco Bay in Emeryville, then across central California and across the Sierra Nevada mountains at Sonora Pass near Bodie, California, and then east to a connection with the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad in Utah. The California and Mt. Diablo was sold to the California and Nevada. The California and Nevada reached San Pablo, California in 1886. It was subsequently extended around the northern end of the Berkeley Hills and the San Pablo Ridge, then southeastward down the valley drained by San Pablo Creek to Orinda, running along what is now the eastern shoreline of San Pablo Reservoir. A shortage of capital and constant problems with washed-out tracks barred further extensions. For most of its duration, the railroad was primarily run for weekend excursions. The railroad reached Orinda (then called \\"Bryants\\"), its furthest extent, in November, 1891. At this point, it owned and operated of track. On May 29, 1896 and again on July 12, 1899 the railroad was placed into receivership. After 1900 the railroad ceased to operate. The railroad was sold at foreclosure on November 29, 1902. Oakland & East Side Railroad The nascent pier into San Francisco Bay was acquired by \\"Borax\\" Smith who used it as the basis for construction of his massive interurban Key System causeway and ferry pier. On March 7, 1903 the Oakland and East Side Railroad acquired the right-of-way of the California and Nevada on behalf of its parent company, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (see \\"paper railroad\\"). Santa Fe wanted the California & Nevada to gain access to Oakland from the Santa Fe's terminal at Richmond, California. The track beyond Richmond (from a point just north of today's El Cerrito Del Norte BART Station) to Orinda was abandoned. In 1903, Santa Fe converted the narrow gauge to standard track gauge between Richmond and Oakland. Upon completion of the standardization, on May 16, 1904, the Oakland and East Side Railroad was leased to the Santa Fe. That same day, the first Santa Fe train passed over the line. Route Clancy's Cut *Oakland *Emerys (Emeryville) *Berkeley *Albany *El Cerrito *Richmond *San Pablo *Oak Grove (El Sobrante) *Fargos *Orinda Park *Bryant The right-of-way today The track from San Pablo to Orinda follows much of the route of the San Pablo Dam Road through El Sobrante. The Santa Fe line between Richmond and Oakland was abandoned by the Santa Fe in the early 1980s when the Santa Fe obtained trackage rights into Oakland via Southern Pacific Railroad's parallel line to the west. Today, the Ohlone Greenway runs along the original California & Nevada right-of-way between El Cerrito Del Norte Station and Albany. A bicycle path follows the course of the tracks while a BART aerial line runs along the western edge, within the old right-of way.

He was Conservative MP for Manchester North West from 1883 to 1906, and sometime chairman of the Fine Cotton Spinners' Association. He was made a baronet in 1887. Life Ape in Vanity Fair, 1885 Houldsworth bought farmland by the Stockport Branch Canal in Reddish in the 1860s and built Reddish Mill, then the largest cotton-spinning mill in the world (started 1863, completed 1865). Four members of the Houldsworth family were 60% shareholders in the Reddish Spinning Company Limited which built the North Mill (started 1870) and the Middle Mill (started 1874). An Institute (now Houldsworth working men's club) was completed in 1874. All the above were designed by the architect Abraham Stott. Houldsworth commissioned the architect Alfred Waterhouse to design St. Elisabeth's church, rectory and school. All the above buildings are still standing. The start of a model village was also laid out, Houldsworth Model Village, with a variety of houses built in front of the mill. Some of the houses have been demolished, but those in Houldsworth Street and Liverpool Street remain. He was created a baronet in 1887 as Sir William Henry Houldsworth, of Reddish, in the Parish of Manchester, in the County Palatine of Lancaster, and of Coodham in the Parish of Symington in the County of Ayr. The City of Manchester made him a freeman in 1905, and the Victoria University of Manchester awarded him an honorary LLD. In later life, Houldsworth moved away from Reddish and Manchester, and concentrated on his estate, Coodham, Ayrshire in Scotland, where he built a domestic chapel designed by Alfred Waterhouse. Legacy Several features in Reddish are named after Houldsworth. A drinking fountain and four-faced clock, paid for by public subscription, was unveiled in Houldsworth Square on 11 September 1920.

The band included two other surviving members of Lynyrd Skynyrd, Billy Powell and Leon Wilkeson. The band wished to develop their own sound rather than being regarded as a reformed Lynyrd Skynyrd, and toward that objective they hired a female lead vocalist, Dale Krantz, who later married Rossington. The Jacksonville-based band released two albums before disbanding in 1982. Their biggest hit, \\"Don't Misunderstand Me,\\" charted in late 1980. Formation history Following the crash of the Skynyrd plane in October 1977, chances for a reunion looked slim. Allen Collins had severe injuries to his arm that almost made it necessary for the arm to be amputated. Leon Wilkeson had suffered internal injuries that initially made doctors declare him dead at the scene of the crash, only to be resuscitated later. He also had a badly broken arm. Gary Rossington had also suffered severe injuries in the crash. Only Artimus Pyle (former Lynyrd Skynyrd drummer) and Billy Powell were in good enough condition to be released from the hospital within two weeks of the crash. The earliest recording effort made by former band members were Pyle and Powell's involvement in the studio sessions for musician Leo LeBranche. Soon after, Powell, Pyle, Wilkeson, and Jo Billingsley (former Skynyrd vocalist) formed the band Alias (not to be confused with the 1980s Canadian rock band of the same name), which only existed for one album and a small round of live shows. The band also featured guitarist Barry Lee Harwood (who had played mandolin on Skynyrd's \\"Gimme Back My Bullets\\" record of 1976) and who would later be involved with the RCB. Charlie Daniels gave new hope to fans in January 1979, when he announced \\"Lynyrd Skynyrd is back!\\" at his Volunteer Jam V in Nashville, Tennessee. All remaining members of Lynyrd Skynyrd, with the exception of bassist Wilkeson (whose arm was still in a cast) performed an instrumental version of \\"Free Bird.\\" From there, plans began to form a new band. However, Rossington and Collins did not wish for this new venture to be another Lynyrd Skynyrd, so they opted for Dale Krantz, who had been a backing singer for .38 Special and who Gary Rossington later married in 1982. Guitarist Barry Lee Harwood was living in Atlanta at the time when he got the call from Rossington and Collins to be in the band. All seemed set, until Artimus Pyle, who had been slated to start rehearsals with the band, was involved in a motorcycle accident that broke his leg. Pyle decided that the RCB should find a new drummer rather than wait for him to recuperate. The suggestion came from Harwood to hire Jacksonville native Derek Hess. The Rossington-Collins Band, as it was named, then began rehearsals and writing, which took a little longer than expected because of Krantz's initial anxiety about being in this band. Even while in the studio, RCB would continue to write and revise their songs until they were considered finished. This led to the use of many master reels of recordings. Touring history The band initially premiered in the summer of 1980 to positive reviews. One highlight of the 1980 tour backing their album Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere, was a New Year's Eve performance at the Omni in Atlanta, Georgia. One permanent feature in the set lists was \\"Free Bird,\\" which was performed without vocals and was dedicated to Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines, Cassie Gaines, and Dean Kilpatrick. At one performance in Springfield, Massachusetts during 1980, guitarist Rossington had to play onstage with a broken leg, which happened the day before. Following the death of his wife, Kathy, Allen Collins would routinely walk off from gigs or not appear. This led to the cancellation of many performances during 1982. In addition to his Fender Stratocaster and Gibson Explorer, guitarist Collins switched between two double-cutaway Gibson Les Paul Specials during the live shows. Collins had not used a Les Paul since the early 1970s. Despite the short length of The Rossington-Collins Band's existence, there were many soundboard recordings made of live shows, and studio recordings made by Allen Collins in preparation for their first studio album.  Allen Collins Band  In 1983, the Allen Collins Band, featuring Allen Collins, Barry Lee Harwood, Leon Wilkeson, Billy Powell, and Derek Hess from RCB along with Randall Hall and Jimmy Dougherty, former singer in Alias, was formed but quickly fell apart due to Collins' erratic behavior and lack of leadership. Collins tried to resurrect the project in 1985 but was sidelined by a serious injury, which left him partially paralyzed, when he crashed his car into a culvert near his Mandarin home. Collins assembled a Skynyrd-tribute band in 1987, which would evolve into a full-fledged Skynyrd re-formation.

Arts festivals may feature a mixed program that include music, literature, comedy, children's entertainment, science, or street theatre, and are typically presented in venues over a period of time ranging from as short as a day or a weekend to a month. Each event within the program is usually separately ticketed. Arts festivals are largely curated by an artistic director who handles the organizations' artistic direction and can encompass different genres, including fringe theater festivals that are open access, making arts festivals distinctive from greenfield festivals, which typically are weekend camping festivals such as Glastonbury, and Visual Arts Festivals, which concentrate on the visual arts. Another type of arts festivals are music festivals, which are outdoor musical events usually spanning a weekend, featuring a number of bands and musical genres including pop, rock, heavy- metal, and more. Since the 1960s, world-music festivals have become popular in a variety of countries. The most well-recognized music festival was Woodstock, which took place in 1969 in Bethel, New York. It was attended by 400,000 people and featured performances by The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and the Grateful Dead. History Probably the two oldest arts festivals are located in England. The Three Choirs Festival in the West of England was established as a \\"yearly musical assembly\\" by 1719. The other is the Norfolk and Norwich Festival which first took place in 1772. The largest arts festival in England today is the Brighton Festival Fringe. Leading arts festivals include the Edinburgh Festival in Edinburgh, Adelaide Festival of Arts in Adelaide, the Biennale of Sydney, Festival d'Avignon in Avignon, France, and Tongyeong International Music Festival in Tongyeong, Korea and Sanskruti Arts Festival, Upvan, India. One-off arts festivals have included the Liverpool08 European Capital of Culture in 2008. In the summer of 1793, revolutionary France was invaded by foreign armies which resulted in the destruction of all signs of royalty. During this time, French citizens sang, danced, and theaters as well as indoor music multiplied. By 1793, two dozen new venues for music and drama had been established, as a result of the end of restrictive monopolies that previously ruled. Art dealings were rapidly increasing and as a flood of paintings were for sale, this reduced artists to near impoverishment. Therefore, as a result, this called for an attempt to replace the old system of the arts with a new one. This gave rise to festivals that were used not only as an artistic outlet, but also for political protest against the old government system. These festivals often included religious symbolism, political messages and embodied the spirit of liberty, equality and fraternity. In 1792, The \\"Festival of Liberty\\" included a Declaration of the rights of man, busts of Voltaire, Rousseau, and Franklin, a hymn to liberty, women in white carrying chains, and a large chariot with a seated statue of liberty Types of arts festivals Arts festival An Arts Festival is an umbrella-term for a festival that focuses on multiple art genres including fine art (painting, drawing, pottery), music, photography, film, and other visual styles. Fringe festivals are a type of arts festival, often focusing on many arts but sometimes focusing on a specific art such as theater more than others. Some subgenres of an arts festival include art fairs, theater festivals, dance festivals, film festivals, music festivals (pop festivals) and more. Art fair An art fair is a subgenre of arts festival that focuses on visual art specifically, or specific fields of visual art such as new media art festivals. Other subgenres of art festivals are termed photography festivals or street art festivals, for example. Typically, an art fair has a wide range of artists, art dealers, collectors, and curators who buy or sell artwork in a venue, or gallery, that is open to the public. Some items for sale include photography, paintings, drawings, metalwork, handcrafted items and pottery. Festivals of visual arts are also not to be confused with commercial art fairs. Artists participate in the most important of such festival exhibitions by invitation, and these exhibitions (e.g. the Venice Biennale) are organised by internationally recognized curators chosen by a committee of peers. Conversely art fairs are market-oriented shows where art dealers exhibit and sell the work of the artists they represent. Theater festival The first drama festival was in 543BC, at the Athenian Great Dionysia. At the drama festivals, playwrights and poets competed to have their plays performed, and the actors competed to win the title for best performance. The performances were given in semi-circular auditorium cut into hillsides and capable of seating 10,000‚Äì20,000 people. The stage consisted of a dancing floor, an orchestra, dressing room and scene-building area, known as a skene. The actors were typically men who wore masks appropriate to the characters they represented, and each might play several parts. Film festival Film festivals are organized events, usually staged by universities, private organizations, local governments, or arts associations, that show films in cinemas or screening venues and provide filmmakers a chance to get notable recognition among fellow film enthusiasts. Films can include international and domestic releases and can even be on a specific film-maker, genre or subject matter. Film festivals are typically annual events and can feature full-length or short films. One of the most notable Film Festivals is the Sundance Film Festival, which originated from Salt Lake City in 1984 as part of the Sundance Institute organization and was founded by Robert Redford. To this date, it is one of the largest independent cinema festivals in the United States. Poetry festival Poetry festivals are organized events staged by poetry and literature groups, local arts associations, private organizations and others that showcase contemporary poetry and provide a chance for poets to meet each other, celebrate poetry, critique each other's work and debate poetic issues. Poets can include international, national and local writers, and can include a specific theme. They are often held in a particular location over set dates. In contrast to literary festivals, poetry festivals put poetry centre stage. Poetry Festivals are typically annual events. Festivals established for more than 10 years in the UK include the festivals at Aldeburgh, Ledbury and Torbay, and the Stanza Poetry festival in Scotland. In India, a number of popular poetry festivals and in Northeast India, Guwahati Grand Poetry festival and Assam Arts Biennale, which began in 2018, are the first of its kind in the region.

Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court regarding the power of Congress, pursuant to Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, to enact laws that enforce and interpret provisions of the Constitution.  Background  Prior to the 1960s, many US states and municipalities used literacy tests to disenfranchise minorities. In 1959, the US Supreme Court held, in Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections, that literacy tests were not necessarily violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, nor of the 15th Amendment. In 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which sought to safeguard the voting rights of disenfranchised minorities. Among other provisions, the Voting Rights Act made some literacy tests illegal. Section 4(e) was aimed at securing the franchisement of New York City's large Puerto Rican population and \\"provides that no person who has completed the sixth grade in a public school, or an accredited private school, in Puerto Rico in which the language of instruction was other than English shall be disfranchised for inability to read or write English.\\" Registered voters in the state of New York brought suit by alleging that Congress exceeded its powers of enforcement under the 14th Amendment and alleging that Congress infringed on rights reserved to states by the 10th Amendment. Decision By a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court sided with Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, reversed the District Court, and held that Section 4(e) was constitutional. Writing the majority opinion, Justice Brennan stressed that Section 5 of the amendment is \\"a positive grant of legislative power authorizing Congress to exercise its discretion in determining the need for and nature of legislation to secure Fourteenth Amendment guarantees.\\" Justice Brennan applied the appropriateness standard of McCulloch v. Maryland (1819) to determine whether the legislation passed constitutional muster. Section 4(e) arguably expanded rights beyond what the Court had recognized in Lassiter, but Brennan ruled that Section 4(e) was appropriate. In doing so, he has often been credited with introducing the \\"ratchet theory\\" for congressional legislation enacted under Section 5. It held that Congress could ratchet up civil rights beyond what the Court had recognized, but Congress could not ratchet down judicially recognized rights. The \\"ratchet theory\\" essentially set judicially recognized rights as a support on which Congress could expand if it so chose. According to the theory, Brennan's opinion allowed for multiple interpreters of the Fourteenth Amendment, as opposed to just that of the judiciary. In dissent, Justice Harlan criticized the \\"ratchet theory\\" and the idea of multiple interpreters of the 14th Amendment. Harlan relied on the separation of powers doctrine to argue that allowing Congress to interpret the 14th Amendment undercut the power of the judiciary. He objected to Congress having the power to interpret the 14th Amendment substantively (to create new rights). Harlan argued that the appropriate use of Section 5 power was the enforcement of judicially- recognized 14th Amendment rights. Significance Katzenbach v. Morgan is a prime example of judicial deference to Congressional authority. It allowed Congress great latitude in use of Section 5. The Supreme Court, 31 years after Katzenbach, revisited the \\"ratchet\\" interpretation, in the case of City of Boerne v. Flores (1997) and stated, \\"This is not a necessary interpretation, however, or even the best one.\\" By striking down the state application of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, it addressed the separation of powers concerns that had been voiced earlier by Harlan.

Etymology View of Finansbank Tower and B√ºy√ºkdere Avenue in Levent, from the observation deck of Istanbul Sapphire. View of B√ºy√ºkdere Avenue in Levent at night, from the observation deck of Istanbul Sapphire. Levent is also a name for men in Turkey (cf. Levent) that derives from the Levend, a type of soldier (naval infantry) of the Ottoman Navy.Kƒ±yafet-i Asakir-i Bahriyye: Costumes and ranks of the Ottoman Navy Levend itself has derived from Levantino (Levantine) which means Person from the Levant (East Mediterranean) in Italian.Dictionary of American Family Names, Oxford University Press, . This was how the Italians (the Genoese and Venetians) used to call the Ottoman sailors, a name which was also adopted by the Ottoman Turks.Sevan Ni≈üanyan. S√∂zlerin Soyaƒüacƒ±: √áaƒüda≈ü T√ºrk√ßenin Etimolojik S√∂zl√ºƒü√º. URL: http://www.nisanyansozluk.com/search.asp?w=levent Retrieved 30 October 2009. The use of the word levend for describing seamen first appeared in the Ottoman Turkish language during the 16th century. These marine soldiers had the reputation of possessing strong, muscular physiques and daring, fearless characters; which is the reason why the Turkish word levent, its Greek cognate lev√©nti (ŒªŒµŒ≤Œ≠ŒΩœÑŒ∑) and its Bulgarian cognate lev√©nt (–ª–µ–≤–µ–Ω—Ç) are still popularly used for defining \\"athletic, gallant, brave\\" men. The name Levent (Levend) came to be applied to the neighbourhood because in 1780 the Ottoman Fleet Admiral Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha was awarded a farmland here by the Ottoman Sultan Abd√ºlhamid I; and in the early 19th century a military compound was built in the area of this farm.Haldun H√ºrel. Semtleri, Mahalleri, Caddeleri ve Sokaklarƒ± A'dan Z'ye ƒ∞stanbul'un Alfabetik √ñyk√ºs√º. ƒ∞karus, 2008. . Page 220. The nearby ƒ∞stinye neighbourhood on the European shoreline of the Bosphorus also featured an important shipyard and dock for maintaining and repairing the military vessels of the Ottoman Navy. However, the Imperial Arsenal (Ters√¢ne-i √Çmire) and the Naval Ministry (Bahriye Nezareti) of the Ottoman Navy were located on the shores of the Golden Horn. History Kanyon Towers & Mall on B√ºy√ºkdere Avenue in Levent. Heading towards Levent through the Bosphorus Bridge (1973), the oldest of three suspension bridges and two tunnels which connect Istanbul's Asian and European sides. In the early 19th century, during the final years of the reign of Sultan Selim III, the first military compound of the Nizam-ƒ± Cedid (New Order) Army was built in Levent; which was then known as the Levend √áiftliƒüi (Levend Farmlands), eventually becoming known as the Levend Kƒ±≈ülasƒ± (Levend Barracks). In 1868, during the first territorial organization of the Istanbul Municipality, Levend (Levent) was placed within the district of Be≈üikta≈ü (which was designated as the 7th Area of the Istanbul Municipality), having remained within this district ever since. The modern neighbourhood of Levent was formed in 1947, when Emlak Kredi Bankasƒ± (a Turkish bank which was established to finance housing projects) chose the Levent area for constructing a well-planned residential compound, formed mostly of villa type houses with gardens. After the completion of the first phase of the Levent project in 1960, numerous other residential compounds were constructed in the area, eventually extending towards nearby Etiler. Starting from the late 1980s and early 1990s, with initial projects such as the Sabancƒ± Center, Yapƒ± Kredi Towers, TAT Towers, Metrocity Towers and ƒ∞≈ü Bankasƒ± Towers, Levent became a popular location for constructing new skyscrapers, mostly owned by Turkish banks and conglomerates. One of the city's major skyline clusters (together with those of Maslak and ≈ûi≈üli on the European side; and Ata≈üehir and Kozyataƒüƒ± on the Asian side of Istanbul) is located in Levent. At present, Levent hosts the tallest skyscraper of Istanbul and Turkey, the 54-floor Istanbul Sapphire; while the construction of numerous new mixed-use skyscraper projects and shopping malls are ongoing in the neighbourhood, which has evolved into a central business district.

His pen names included Minh Du·ªá, Phong Tr·∫ßn, L·ªá Thanh, and finally H√†n M·∫∑c T·ª≠, by which name is known today. He grew up in a poor family, his father having died when he was young. He showed poetic talent at a young age. When he met Phan B·ªôi Ch√¢u, he received encouragement and praise that made him well known. He contracted leprosy in 1937, and was finally hospitalized at Quy H√≤a Hospital in September 1940, where he died two months later. His many poems addressed to real or fictive women‚Äîin the manner of Giacomo Leopardi in the West, for example‚Äîremain popular, and he is known as a love poet in Vietnam. His poems on folk subjects are also well known. Poetry H√†n M·∫∑c T·ª≠'s early poems‚Äîpraised by Phan B·ªôi Ch√¢u‚Äîare famous for their purity of diction and form, and show him to be a fluent Classicist with a strong interest in realistic subjects. Subsequently, his poetry showed the influence of French Symbolism, and after he fell sick, became increasingly violent and despondent. Personal despair combined with the search for poetic novelty led him to found the short-lived \\"Chaos\\" (Lo·∫°n) or \\"Mad\\" (√êi√™n) school of poetry. More than a love poet, H√†n M·∫∑c T·ª≠ was a Modernist, who sought to fuse, in a new poetic language, disparate traditions and experiences. Beginning with poems that refreshed the Classical tradition, he went on to absorb the French influence, which he directed toward the turbulence of his own painful history. His language, increasingly tortured, remained both Classical and innovative throughout; and though a Catholic, he made frequent use of Buddhist ideas and imagery.

It was based on the novel of the same name written by Piers Paul Read. The film is about Eddie Dawson, a monk who has led a sheltered existence at a Benedictine monastery, but when he is expelled from his order he has to learn to deal with the harsh realities of everyday life in 1970s London, finding work as a journalist. He falls in love with a beautiful widow then discovers she has been having an affair with his best friend. Eddie later marries a young girl who he first met whilst a priest in the parish, however he decides to return to live as a monk on a remote island. Despite being well received by film critics, the lack of a well-known cast led to a short box office run in the United Kingdom, and a straight to video release for the United States market. The film was chosen as the closer for the Leeds International Film Festival, and in 1999 it was also nominated for Best Film at the UK Creative Freedom Awards. In Canada and the United States the film was re-released in 2004 as Passion of the Priest.

He was notable for having written Total Access while at MIT, and was hired by EarthLink at the age of 16 to work on its development. In 2008, the company had more than one million users. By the age of 17, Gale had earned roughly a million dollars' worth of stock options at EarthLink for his innovative ISP programs. In 1995, Gale's father died from a heart attack, and friends said Gale struggled to come to terms with the loss. He returned to MIT in 1996 and became a music major. After complaints of boredom and depression, on March 13, 1998, Gale jumped to his death from a classroom on the 15th floor of a building on the MIT campus.  Early life and education  Philip Gale and his sister in 1991 Philip Chandler Gale (born 1978, Los Angeles, California) and his younger sister Elizabeth were the children of Marie and David Gale. His parents and much of his immediate family were deeply committed to the Church of Scientology. His mother Marie had been in the church from the age of 12, and her parents and grandparents were also believers. Philip's father was a software engineer, and in 1981 had founded RealWorld, a supplier of accounting software. His parents met through the church in Los Angeles, where Marie was on staff and David was a fanatic. They were married the year Philip was born, until David's sudden death from a heart attack in 1995. The family moved from Los Angeles to New Hampshire when Philip was young, and he showed \\"an early aptitude for numbers and machines\\". Seeing his abilities, Marie taught him at home with another mother, and said that before the age of five, he was reading and doing math at the second and third-grade level. Later they lived in Clearwater, Florida; Charlotte, North Carolina; Utah; and Oregon. From the age of 8, Gale lived and studied at The Delphian School in Sheridan, Oregon, a private boarding school based on L. Ron Hubbard's study technology. Philip's parents personally knew the founder/s of the school. He graduated from there at age 14. At that time, his family had moved to Utah. Gale got a job in programming at the marketing firm where his father worked, but he had contentious relations with fellow workers, as he could outperform many older programmers and had a tendency to treat people who were not as intelligent as he was with contempt. College and EarthLink Gale at a piano Gale was admitted to MIT at the age of 15 in 1993. He initially pursued studies in physics and engineering. In addition to his ability in programming, he was an accomplished musician. At MIT, he joined the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity as a freshman in late 1994. At 16, Gale wrote an important software program called \\"Total Access\\", to increase usage of Internet service providers (ISP). He was hired by EarthLink over Christmas break his first year as a student, and took a 3-semester sabbatical from MIT to work at the company, which had been founded by Sky Dayton, a Scientology member and fellow Delphian School alumnus. As director of research and development, Gale developed his program to increase the ability of the company's internet servers to connect customers to the Internet, giving the firm a competitive advantage that helped it ascend to the top ranks among ISPs. It eventually acquired one million customers and a market share worth $2 billion. During his time away from MIT, Gale started indulging in drinking, smoking, gambling, and unmarried sex, exploring experiences that were at odds with his earlier religious education. He abandoned Scientology, and compared its methods to the self-parodying Church of the SubGenius. During his time at EarthLink, Gale dated a couple of women, but had difficulties relating to many of his coworkers. His father died from a heart attack in 1995, when Gale was 17. It was a sudden death with no previous health conditions known to the family, who was then living in Charlotte, North Carolina. Friends and family said that Gale was profoundly affected by the loss of his father. A year later, he seemed to be struggling with real grief and trying to come to terms with it. Before his 17th birthday he declared legal emancipation, which allowed him to exercise stock options worth about a million dollars at EarthLink, which was about to go public. Return to MIT Gale returned to MIT in 1996, still aged 17. In fall of 1997, he switched from physics to the humanities, becoming a music major and surprising some of his friends. He performed with a chorus and Balinese-style percussion orchestra. With a friend Michael Tarkanian, a materials science major, Gale formed a rock band and played drums. In late 1997 he took a course in \\"Musical Aesthetics and Media Technology\\" with MIT Media Laboratory professor Tod Machover. Machover later said that Gale was \\"a quiet, serious, unusual, talented and brilliant young man\\". As an example, Machover said that a week before his death, Gale had returned with a proposal for a complex project, having gone in his own direction after some of their preliminary discussions. He had proposed to develop a way to analyze diverse sounds, among them crowd noises, nature sounds, and machines clanging, permitting them to be organized and associated according to rhythmic, loudness, and coloristic similarities. \\"The idea was great, and very much in line with some of the more ambitious hopes that our group has for the future of music\\", Machover commented. Gale acquired an expensive new digital recorder to work on this project. Also in the fall of 1997, Gale had moved out of the fraternity house and room which he had shared with his friend Eric Hu, and into an apartment in Central Square with two other students. Hu later said that Gale had mentioned suicide in the weeks before his death, complaining about being bored and depressed, and feeling that his state would not change. Gale had a relationship for months with Christine Hrul, a student at Wellesley College, but he had abruptly broken off their relationship in February 1998. About that time, he wrote an email to an old friend saying he was depressed and thought about suicide. Friends said he had mostly stopped going to class and wasn't eating well. According to Hu, Gale was smoking marijuana regularly at this time, and tried to get Zoloft from his girlfriend, who refused him. He then tried talking to a psychiatrist, with no success. He also tried to obtain LSD, but could not get it immediately. Death For weeks, Gale had been asking classmates how to get access to the roof of MIT's tallest structure, the Cecil and Ida Green Building, which is occupied by the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences Department. On March 13, 1998, at about 7:30 pm in an empty classroom on the 15th floor of the Green Building, Gale brought his portable digital recorder, which he switched on. Gale then wrote and drew the following on the blackboard: Isaac Newton's equation for how an object accelerates as it falls, along with a sketch of a stick figure tossing a chair. He signed it, \\"Phil was here\\", picked up a chair and hurled it through the heavy plate glass window. Witnesses said that he cleared the glass shards away, and then jumped out the window. Eric Plosky, a student at MIT, was inside an adjacent dorm watching television at the time of Gale's death, and heard a crashing sound. Plosky recounted to National Public Radio, \\"The windows of the building were sealed. So he actually had to throw a chair out the window to break it so that he could jump through. The noise that we heard was that chair hitting the ground. Some of the people in my dorm actually looked out the window in time to see him fall.\\" \\"It was typical Phil. It's so like him to have planned a show\\", said his former girlfriend, a Wellesley College student Christine Hrul, \\"He was so careful with things in his life, so methodical\\". Students reported hearing the sound of breaking glass, then a splintering sound, and last a scream. Gale was taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 8:05 pm. Police released part of Gale's suicide note, which was found at his apartment: > Presumably I have jumped from a tall building. Yes, it is odd. To tell you > why would be to tell you my mind! I cannot do this. I am not crazy, albeit > driven to suicide. \\"It is not about any single event, or person. It is about > stubborn sadness, and a detached view of the world. I see my life ‚Äî so much > dreary, mundane, wasted time wishing upon unattainable goals ‚Äî and I feel > little attachment to the future. But it is not so bad, relatively. I > exaggerate. \\"In the end, it is that I am unwilling (sick of living) to live > in mediocrity. And this is what I have chosen to do about it. \\"The saddest > part is the inevitable guilt and sorrow I will force on my family and > friends. But there is not much I can say. I am sorry. Try to understand that > this is about me and my 'fuked up ideas.' It is not because I was raised > poorly or not cared for enough. It just is. \\"Please give my $ to my family > and my gizmos to people who will use them. ‚Äî and no fuking suing! \\"I am > scared of the fall. I am scared of the impact. But when it is through, it > will be through. \\"take care world, Philip\\" Gale closed his handwritten suicide note with a smiley face and the words \\"And stay happy!\\" After an investigation and an autopsy by Cambridge police, Gale's death at the age of nineteen, late on the evening of March 13, 1998, was ruled a suicide. A memorial service was held at the MIT Chapel on March 19. His body was cremated in Boston and his ashes were shipped to his mother for a private ceremony. Gale was survived by his mother Marie and a sister Elizabeth. Media coverage and Scientology Gale on drums Gale was raised a Scientologist, but at the time of his death he had distanced himself from its practices. Gale was said to have fully abandoned his Scientology beliefs while at EarthLink. A close friend at EarthLink, Brian Ladner, said that \\"Leaving Scientology was a traumatic experience. He was brought up thinking it was the only way.\\" Ladner says while they worked together, he introduced Gale to Church of the SubGenius, which specializes in debunking cults and has developed its own cult following. During that period, Ladner reported that Gale hung a poster of J. R. \\"Bob\\" Dobbs, SubGenius' fictional spiritual leader, on his office door. According to Ladner, the pair of young men had also done a lot of partying in Los Angeles, and worked for a time on a \\"pornographic Web site hosted by EarthLink\\". Shortly after Gale's death, speculation on campus, in the media, and on the Internet newsgroup alt.religion.scientology arose. Questions arose about the role his Scientology background may have played in his suicide, particularly because he died on the day that adherents celebrate founder L. Ron Hubbard's birthday. Gale had been in contact with a reporter for the Boston Herald and had been interviewed as part of a scathing 5-part series titled \\"Scientology Unmasked\\", published March 1 through 5, 1998, just days before his suicide by Joseph Mallia. Though Gale was not named in the special report he had been interviewed for, Mallia also wrote an article about his death shortly thereafter. Matthew Munsey, an MIT student who witnessed Gale's suicide, created a website called \\"Who is Philip Gale?\\" in an effort to make sense of the incident. He stated \\"Since this tragedy, I have thought a great deal about Philip and what he was trying to say. These questions need to be answered. Meanwhile, I will collect information here.\\" This site included some personal notes from friends and photos, until it was taken down; it can only be accessed by web archival machines. Others who spoke publicly dismissed the idea that Scientology was significant in his suicide. Lauren McLeod, a reporter with the Concord Journal and friend of Gale's, said that he had been struggling to deal with lasting grief following his father's sudden death from a heart attack in October 1995. His friend Eric Hu said that Gale had complained of being depressed and bored. Another friend from EarthLink had received an email expressing his discontent about a week before his death. In November 1999 a fellow MIT student, Matthew Herper, published an article reflecting on several student deaths, including Gale's suicide. People magazine featured Gale's story in a 2001 series of articles on suicides at MIT, describing him as a music major \\"so prodigiously bright that he counted few of his much older peers as intellectual equals\\". His mother and sister were interviewed and photographed for the article. Though it touched on Gale's Scientology upbringing, it mostly focused on the high suicide rate at MIT and student access to health care on campus. In August 2001, the National Public Radio program All Things Considered noted that, in the wake of Gale's death, MIT had investigated how to deal with issues of student suicides. The student Eric Plosky commented to NPR, \\"In many ways, suicide has been looked on as something that's just part and parcel of life at the Institute. That ingrained thinking historically, I think, has prevented administrators from looking at suicide as a problem to which there might be some reasonable response.\\" The investigative report released by MIT identified deficiencies within its mental health program. Between 1995 and 2015, the rate of suicides among MIT undergraduate students was 50% higher than the national average for college students, and slightly higher than comparable figures at nearby Harvard University. In a 2015 interview, MIT Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart acknowledged that the numbers were of concern, but had improved since the early 2000s.

Rivermont Collegiate is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS), specifically the Independent Schools Association of the Central States (ISACS), the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB), Council for Advance and Support of Education (CASE), and the National Honor Society (NHS). The school currently resides on the former property of Joseph Bettendorf, namesake of the city. History The Joseph Bettendorf Mansion which now houses the upper school. Under the mansion is a tunnel which serves as a tornado and fallout shelter.In 1846, a group of transplanted New England Congregationalists with a strong social-reformer orientation formed the Trustees of Iowa College. Although founded in Davenport, Iowa, Iowa College moved from its Davenport location to the town of Grinnell after being invited by Josiah Bushnell Grinnell to move to his newly founded town, located at the intersection of two major railroads. The Davenport location was later renamed to Griswold College, after Bishop Alexander Viets Griswold of the Eastern Diocese of the Episcopal Church. Griswold College began growing slowly, adding a theological department, and Kemper Hall (which served as a boys' school). In 1883, the trustees of Griswold College received a legacy from the estate of Miss Sarah Burr (an eastern churchwoman), for the establishment of a Church School for Christian girls in the Episcopal Diocese of Iowa. These funds were invested in Cambria Place, a magnificent residence designed by a famous architect (who designed the Illinois State Capitol and the Chicago Board of Trade Building), with five acres of land high on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River in Davenport, Iowa. On September 24, 1884, Bishop William Stevens Perry founded St. Katharine's School, which was placed high among college preparatory schools in the country. Meanwhile, Griswold college, theological department and boys' school were forced to close in the 1890s. The school was originally organized as St. Katharine‚Äôs School, an Episcopal boarding and day school for girls. Located at 10th and Tremont Streets in Davenport, for over eighty years the school educated local girls as well as those from afar. However, St. Katharine‚Äôs later dropped its boarding program, became co-educational, in 1968 adding St. Mark‚Äôs to its name to reflect the change. In 1973, St. Katharine's St. Mark's moved to its current location, the former home of Joseph Bettendorf, and by 1980, the school amicably broke ties with the Episcopal Church. In 2001, the Board of Trustees voted to change the name of the school to Rivermont Collegiate, in order to reduce confusion about its religious affiliation. The Early Days St. Katharine's in the very beginningThe girls at St. Katharine's were subject to strict rules. Students were not allowed to have books, magazines, or newspapers delivered without the principal's permission. Students could not keep any food except for fruit. Students couldn't go to town without a parent or teacher, and no student could spend the night out of the building. The only time students could go home was on Thursdays, but only till 8:00 p.m. They couldn't even spend Sundays at home. The girls were not allowed to wear jewelry, big dresses or silk dresses. Also, one hour of exercise was required every day. In 1910, the taxpayers of Davenport gave an observatory and telescope to the school but it burned to the ground in a fire. Meanwhile, local industrialist Joseph Bettendorf was building his dream house, which later became the signature building of Rivermont Collegiate. Mr. Bettendorf, whose Bettendorf Company manufactured truck frames for railroad cars, helped draw the plans English Manor style mansion on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River. In 1915, he supervised construction of the mansion, complete with a sweeping terraced lawn overlooking the Mississippi. Designed for entertaining railroad executives and community members, the house included a stained glass domed conservatory, formal dining room, parlor, music room, and billiard room. The second floor contained several bedrooms, a large sitting room and servant quarters. A ballroom was located on the third floor, and at one time two bowling alleys were located in the basement. Craftsmen added Italian marble, carved stone, molded plaster and hand-carved woodwork, doors, paneling and staircases throughout the home. The Campus Rivermont Collegiate's campus consists of five buildings on the former Joseph Bettendorf property: The Mansion, which is the former home of Joseph Bettendorf, now houses upper school and middle school classes, as well as administrative offices. The Carriage House, formerly Joseph Bettendorf's garage, is now rebuilt as a boarding house for boarding students. The ribbon cutting for the opening of the rebuilt Carriage House was on July 31, 2017. Becherer Hall was completed in 1999 and houses the lower school and early childhood program, as well as the auditorium and cafeteria. The Gym serves as a basketball and volleyball court. It was added to the mansion in 1974. The STEAM Center was completed in 2019 on the old site of the Wallace House, which was demolished on December 19, 2017. This building includes science, technology, engineering, art, and math classrooms on the first 2 levels, as well as 2 floors capable of holding 32 dorm students, in a 22,000 square foot space. It was estimated to cost $6 million.

However, federal procurement is much more heavily regulated, subject to volumes of statutes dealing with Federal contracts and the Federal contracting process, mostly in Titles 10, 31, 40, and 41 of the United States Code. Value of government procurement In fiscal year 2019, the US Federal Government spent $597bn on contracts. This compares with $442bn in fiscal year 2015 and $461bn in 2016. Federal Procurement Reports provide contract data which may be used for geographical, market, and socio-economic analysis, as well as for measuring and assessing the impact of acquisition policy and management improvements. In Fiscal Year 2010, the top five departments by dollars obligated were: * Department of Defense ($365.9 bn) * Department of Energy ($25.7 bn) * Health and Human Services ($19.0 bn) * General Services Administration ($17.6 bn) * NASA ($16.0 bn). The Top 100 Contractors Report for Fiscal Year 2009 lists contracts totalling $294.6 billion, the top five comprising aerospace and defense contractors: * Lockheed Martin ($38.5 bn) * Boeing ($22.0 bn) * Northrop Grumman ($19.7 bn) * General Dynamics ($16.4 bn) * Raytheon ($16.1 bn) In the same period, small business contracts totalled $96.8 billion. Law The Federal Government's authority to enter into contracts derives from the U.S. Constitution, which defines its powers. The Federal Government acts through legislation, treaties, implementing regulations, and the exercise of those authorities. The Federal Government's power to contract is not set forth expressly and specifically in the U.S. Constitution, but Article 6 appears to assume the continued vitality of \\"Engagements\\" entered into under the preceding Articles of Confederation.U.S. Const., Art. VI Moreover, the power to contract was and is regarded at law as necessarily incidental to the Federal Government's execution of its other powers. An early Supreme Court case, United States v. Thomas Tingey, recognized that the United States Government has a right to enter into a contract.30 U.S. 5 Pet. 115 (1831) It is an incident to the general right of sovereignty, and the United States may, within the sphere of the constitutional powers confided to it and through the instrumentality of the proper department to which those powers are confided, enter into contracts not prohibited by law and appropriate to the just exercise of those powers. Scores of statutes now also expressly authorize departments and agencies to enter into contracts. The U.S. Congress passes legislation that defines the process and additional legislation that provides the funds. Contract law Private parties entering into a contract with one another (i.e., commercial contracts) have more freedom to establish a broad range of contract terms by mutual consent compared to a private party entering into a contract with the Federal Government. Each private party represents its own interests and can obligate itself in any lawful manner. Federal Government contracts allow for the creation of contract terms by mutual consent of the parties, but many areas addressed by mutual consent in commercial contracts are controlled by law in federal contracting and legally require use of prescribed provisions and clauses. In commercial contracting, where one or both parties may be represented by agents whose authority is controlled by the law of agency, the agent is usually allowed to form a contract only with reference to accepted notions of commercial reasonableness and perhaps a few unique statutes which apply. In Federal Government contracting, specific regulatory authority is required for the Government's agent to enter into the contract, and that agent's bargaining authority is strictly controlled by statutes and regulations reflecting national policy choices and prudential limitations on the right of federal employees to obligate federal funds. By contrast, in commercial contracting, the law allows each side to rely on the other's authority to make a binding contract on mutually agreeable terms. Executive branch agencies enter into the contracts and expend the funds to achieve their Congressionally defined missions. When disputes arise, administrative processes within the agencies may resolve them, or the contractor can appeal to the courts. The procurement process for executive branch agencies (as distinguished from legislative or judicial bodies) is governed primarily by the Armed Services Procurement Act and the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act. To address the many rules imposed by Congress and the courts, a body of administrative law has been developed through the Federal Acquisition Regulation. This 53-part regulation defines the procurement process, including special preference programs, and includes the specific language of many clauses mandated for inclusion within Government contracts.The FAR can be found at Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations Most agencies also have supplemental regulatory coverage contained in what are known as FAR Supplements. These supplements appear within the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) volumes of the respective agencies. For example, the Department of Defense (DOD) FAR Supplement can be found at 10 CFR. Government contracts are governed by federal common law, a body of law which is separate and distinct from the bodies of law applying to most businesses‚Äîthe Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and the general law of contracts. The UCC applies to contracts for the purchase and sale of goods, and to contracts granting a security interest in property other than land. The UCC is a body of law passed by the U.S. state legislatures and is generally uniform among the states. The general law of contracts, which applies when the UCC does not, is mostly common law, and is also similar across the states, whose courts look to each other's decisions when there is no in-state precedent. Contracts directly between the Government and its contractors (\\"prime contracts\\") are governed by the federal common law. Contracts between the prime contractor and its subcontractors are governed by the contract law of the respective states. Differences between those legal frameworks can put pressure on a prime contractor. United States Constitution The authority to purchase is not one of the explicitly enumerated powers given to the Federal Government by Section 8 of Article One of the United States Constitution, but courts found that power implicit in the Constitutional power to make laws that are necessary and proper for executing its specifically granted powers, such as the powers to establish post offices, post roads, banks, an army, a navy, or militias. Statutes Model of the Acquisition Process Behind any Federal Government acquisition is legislation that permits it and provided money for it. These are normally covered in authorization and appropriation legislation. Generally, this legislation does not affect the acquisition process itself, although the appropriation process has been used to amend procurement laws, notably with the Federal Acquisition Reform Act (FARA) and the Federal Acquisitions Streamlining Act (FASA). Other relevant laws include the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, the Armed Services Procurement Act (ASPA) and the Antideficiency Act. = Antideficiency Act = U.S. Federal fiscal law is about Congressional oversight of the Executive Branch, not principally toward getting the mission accomplished nor getting a good deal for the Government. Fiscal law frequently prevents Government agencies from signing agreements that commercial entities would sign. Therefore, fiscal law can constrain a Federal agency from the quickest, easiest, or cheapest way to accomplish its mission. This Constitutionally mandated oversight of the use of public funds is associated with the principle of checks and balances. A good working relationship and robust communication between the Executive and Legislative branches is the key to avoiding problems in this area. The teeth for fiscal law comes from the Antideficiency Act (ADA), which provides that no one can obligate the Government to make payments for which money has not already been appropriated. The ADA also prohibits the Government from receiving gratuitous services without explicit statutory authority. In particular, an ADA violation occurs when a Federal agency uses appropriated funds for a different purpose than is specified in the appropriations act which provided the funds to the agency. The ADA is directly connected to several other fiscal laws, namely the Purpose Act and the Bona Fide Needs Rule. Money appropriated for one purpose cannot be used for a different purpose, according to the Purpose Act ().The Purpose Act says \\"Appropriations shall be applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law.\\" The annual DoD appropriations acts include approximately 100 different appropriations (known as \\"colors of money\\"), and by this rule operations and maintenance (O&M;) funds may not be used to buy weapons. Even an expenditure within the apparent scope of one appropriation may not be permissible if there is a more specific appropriation or the agency has made a previous funds election contrary to the proposed use of funds. For example, O&M; fund can be used for purchasing repair parts, but if the parts are required to effect a major service life extension that is no longer repair but replacement ‚Äì procurement funds must be used if the total cost is more than $250,000 (otherwise known as the Other Procurement threshold, for example, Other Procurement Army (OPA) threshold) or another procurement appropriation is available such as the armored vehicle or weapons appropriation. An Antideficiency Act violation can also occur when a contract uses funds in a period that falls outside of the time period the funds are authorized for use under what is known as the Bona Fide Needs rule (31 USC 1502), which provides: \\"The balance of a fixed-term appropriation is available only for payment of expenses properly incurred during the period of availability or to complete contracts properly made within that period.\\" The Bona Fide Need Rule is a fundamental principle of appropriations law addressing the availability as to time of an agency's appropriation. 73 Comp. Gen. 77, 79 (1994); 64 Comp. Gen. 410, 414-15 (1985). The rule establishes that an appropriation is available for obligation only to fulfill a genuine or bona fide need of the period of availability for which it was made. 73 Comp. Gen. 77, 79 (1994). It applies to all Federal Government activities carried out with appropriated funds, including contract, grant, and cooperative agreement transactions. 73 Comp. Gen. 77, 78-79 (1994). An agency's compliance with the bona fide need rule is measured at the time the agency incurs an obligation, and depends on the purpose of the transaction and the nature of the obligation being entered into. 61 Comp. Gen. 184, 186 (1981) (bona fide need determination depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case). In the grant context, the obligation occurs at the time of award. 31 Comp. Gen. 608 (1952). See also 31 U.S.C. Sec. 1501(a)(5)(B). Simply put, this rule states that the Executive Branch may only use current funds for current needs ‚Äì they cannot buy items which benefit future year appropriation periods (i.e., 1 October through 30 September) without a specific exemption. The net result of this rule is funds expire after the end date for which Congress has specified their availability. For example, a single year fund expires on 1 October of the year following their appropriation (i.e., FY07 appropriations. (for example, 1 October 2006 through 30 September 2007) expire on 1 October 2007). For example, operations and maintenance funds generally cannot be used to purchase supplies after 30 September of the year they are appropriated within with several exceptions ‚Äì 1) the severable services exemption under 10 USC 2410 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-34, Instructions on Budget Execution, 2) Authorized stockage level exceptions and 3) long lead time exception.

It was revoked by President Reagan in 1983 by Executive Order 12430.US Code, Title 41, section 252 Kennedy's order reflected concern that \\"the prevalence of identical bidding [was] harmful to the effective functioning of a system of competitive bids\\" and that \\"identical bidding [might] constitute evidence of the existence of conspiracies to monopolize or restrain trade or commerce\\".Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project, Executive Order 10936 ‚Äî Reports of Identical Bids, published April 24, 1961, accessed 24 May 2018 Reagan's order argued that the requirement had \\"proved ineffective\\" and \\"consume[d] resources that could be employed in a more effective manner to prevent antitrust violations\\".Gerhard Peters and John T.

Reg. 25,648 (May 9, 1997) for Government response to comments on the proposal, and 62 Fed. Reg. 25,786 (May 9, 1997) (proposed rules), 63 Fed. Reg. 35,719 (June 30, 1998) (interim rules), and 63 Fed. Reg. 36,120 (July 1, 1998) (interim rules), Federal Acquisition Regulation, Reform of Affirmative Action in Federal Procurement addressing the General Services Administration (GSA), NASA, and DoD. Federal Acquisition Regulation The procurement process is subject to legislation and regulation separate from the authorization and appropriation process. These regulations are included in the Code of Federal Regulations (\\"CFR\\"), the omnibus listing of Government regulations, as Title 48. Chapter 1 of Title 48 is commonly called the Federal Acquisition Regulation (\\"FAR\\"). The remaining chapters of Title 48 are supplements to the FAR for specific agencies. The process for promulgating regulations including the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) includes publication of proposed rules in the Federal Register and receipt of comments from the public before issuing the regulation. Courts treat the FAR as having the \\"force and effect of law\\", and Contracting Officers do not have the authority to deviate from it. Supplements to the FAR have been issued following the same process, and have the same force and effect. The FAR and its supplements permit a substantial variation from the purchases of paperclips to battleships. The Contracting Officer and the contractor must seek to achieve their sometimes conflicting goals while following the requirements of the regulations. As with any complex document (in book form, Title 48 of the CFR requires several shelves), the FAR and its supplements can be interpreted differently by different people. Trade-in or sales authority 40 USC 181(c) provides that \\"In acquiring personal property, any executive agency, under regulations to be prescribed by the Administrator, subject to regulations prescribed by the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy pursuant to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, may exchange or sell similar items and may apply the exchange allowance or proceeds of sale in such cases in whole or in part payment for the property acquired\\". The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 gives agencies general authority to sell federal personal property and use the proceeds to replace similar property during the same fiscal year or the next one, like a used car trade-in.US Dept of the Treasury, Disposition of personal property, accessed 11 July 2020 The Miscellaneous Receipts Act mandates that funds received by the US Government must be deposited in the miscellaneous receipts account at the US Treasury unless a specific exemption was authorized by Congress.31 USC 3302 The Miscellaneous Receipts Act prevents the Executive Branch from financing itself except as specifically authorized by Congress. 40 USC 181(c) thus is necessary to ensure a command that essentially trades or sells items, frequently information technology (IT) equipment, can retain the receipts from the trade-in or sale and apply them to acquisition of replacement items. Acquisition process Generally, federal acquisitions begin with identification of a requirement by a specific Federal activity. A basic idea of what is needed and the problem statement are prepared and the requiring activity meets with an acquisition command having a Contracting Officer with an appropriate warrant issued by a specific acquisition activity. A contracting agency has the discretion to determine its own needs and the best method to accommodate them.Government Accountability Office (GAO), Matter of: Ocean Services LLC B-292511.2, published 6 November 2003, accessed 8 July 2020 Contracting Officers Each Contracting Officer (CO) has a specific warrant which states the conditions under which they are permitted to engage in Federal contracting as an agent of the Government. The authority of a Contracting Officer to contract on behalf of the Government is set forth in a public document (a certificate of appointment, formerly called a \\"warrant\\") which a person dealing with the Contracting Officer can review. The CO does not have authority to act outside this warrant or to deviate from the laws and regulations controlling Federal Government contracts. The private contracting party is held to know the limitations of the CO's authority, even if the CO does not. This makes contracting with the United States a more structured and restricted process than a commercial one. Unless specifically prohibited by another provision of law, an agency's authority to contract is vested in the agency head, for example, the Secretary of the Air Force or the Administrator, National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Agency heads delegate their authority to Contracting Officers, who either hold their authority by virtue of their position or must be appointed in accordance with procedures set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Only Contracting Officers may sign Government contracts on behalf of the Government.48 CFR ¬ß 1.601 A Contracting Officer has only the authority delegated pursuant to law and agency procedures. Unlike in commercial contracting, there is no doctrine of apparent authority applicable to the Government. Any action taken by a Contracting Officer which exceeds their actual delegated authority is not binding on the Government, even if both the Contracting Officer and the contractor desire the action and the action benefits the Government. The contractor is presumed to know the scope of the Contracting Officer's authority and cannot rely on any action of Contracting Officers when it exceeds their authority. Contracting Officers are assisted in their duties by Contracting Officer Representatives (CORs) and Contracting Officer Technical Representatives (COTRs), who usually do not have the authority of a Contracting Officer. Planning The Contracting Officer and internal departments/end users ideally undertake a planning exercise in advance of procurement commencing. Acquisition planning is described in FAR Part 7, Acquisition Planning, and in agency supplements to the FAR, for example, Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) 207, Acquisition Planning and the US Army's supplementary regulation, AFARS Part 7, Acquisition Planning.Acquisition.gov, Army Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement: Subpart 5107.1 - Acquisition Plans, accessed 22 July 2020 Acquisition planning is frequently dependent on the circumstances. For example, during World War II, quantity was the key. As in the Civil War, the U.S. achieved victory due in large part to the industrial base in the northern states. A war of attrition requires massive quantities of material, but not necessarily of great quality. During the Cold War, quality was key. The United States may not have had as many pieces of equipment as their opposition, but that equipment could be more effective, efficient, or lethal, and offset the opposition's numerical advantage. Today, the military needs equipment that works where it is needed, is dependable, has a high degree of maintainability, has long-term reliability, is agile and versatile, and aims to avoid equipment choices which might result in political debate and partisan politics. As part of the acquisition planning process, the Government must address its buying power leverage. Many Government acquisition commands write acquisitions solely based on haphazard acquisition strategies which are primarily directed toward avoiding bid protests. Thus, it is necessary to emphasize competition and understand the acquisition from the view point of the contractor; Government acquisition commands should ask what is to be achieved and whether or not the program is really in the best interest of the Government, specifying needs in a manner designed to achieve full and open competition and including restrictive requirements \\"only to the extent that they are necessary to satisfy the agency's legitimate needs\\".Government Accountability Office (GAO), Matter of Maritime Industries, Inc., B-407254, published 20 November 2012, accessed 22 July 2020 Many federal acquisitions are rushed due to poor time management. In these cases, the tendency is to issue a sole-source contract to known vendors even though FAR Part 6 specifically forbids sole-source contracting when it is due to lack of advanced planning. There is also a high cost premium that is added to the cost of an acquisition when a buyer wants a supplier/vendor to rush to execute a contract or push their contract to the head of all other work the contractor/vendor is executing. It is often said that \\"if you want it bad, you get it bad\\". Accordingly, poor acquisition planning generally produces poor and unjustifiable acquisition outcomes. Thus, it is critical to understand the time resources required to properly plan and execute a federal acquisition: generally, the acquisition of moderate to complex requirements requires at least 120 days. Preparing a proposal Frequently, contractor proposals in response to a Request for Proposals (RFP) include an exact copy of the RFP's statement of work. An offeror's response usually indicates their approach to performing the statement of work, their approach to managing the program or project, and examples of past performance on projects similar in size, scope, and complexity. ;Responsible bidders and responsive bids Potential vendors responding to RFPs may be characterised as \\"responsible\\" and/or \\"responsive\\". A \\"responsible bidder\\" is one who is qualified or capable of meeting the requirements set out by the government in its bid solicitation or RFP.Comptroller General of the United States, Matter of Airtronics, Inc., published 4 August 1978, accessed 24 June 2020 Kate Manuel notes that the concept of responsibility on the part of a bidder \\"has been the federal government‚Äôs policy since its earliest days\\". James F. Nagle, in his History of Government Contracting, describes how Robert Morris made contract awards to the lowest-priced qualified responsible bidder in contracting for the U.S. Army during the Revolutionary War.Manuel, K. M., Responsibility Determinations Under the Federal Acquisition Regulation: Legal Standards and Procedures, Congressional Research Service, published 4 January 2013, accessed 24 June 2020 A \\"responsive bidder\\" is one who submits a \\"responsive bid\\", one which, if accepted by the government as submitted, will obligate the contractor to perform the exact thing being called for in the solicitation.U S Government Accountability Office, Decision B-233321, B-233321.2, Jan 23, 1989, 89-1 CPD 58, accessed 24 June 2020 FAR 14.301 states: :To be considered for award, a bid must comply in all material respects with the invitation for bids. Such compliance enables bidders to stand on an equal footing and maintain the integrity of the sealed bidding system.FAR 14.301(a), accessed 23 June 2020 The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has observed that \\"responsiveness is determined at the time of bid opening from the face of the bid documents\\",GAO, Decision: Matter of Veterans Construction of South Carolina LLC, file B-401723.3, 21 January 2010 and that \\"unless something on the face of the bid, or specifically a part of it, limits, reduces or modifies the bidder's obligation to perform in accordance with the terms of the solicitation, the bid is responsive\\".GAO, Cal-Tex Lumber Co Inc, B-277705, 24 September 1997, 97-2 CPD, section 87 at 3 Furthermore, \\"the required commitment to the terms of the invitation need not be made in the exact manner specified by the solicitation; all that is necessary is that the bidder, in some fashion, commit itself to the solicitation's material requirements\\".GAO, Challenger Piping, Inc., 65 Comp.Gen. 505, 507 (1986), 86-1 CPD Para. 385 at 4 In general, failure of a bidder to include completed standard representations and certifications does not render the bid nonresponsive because it does not affect the bidder's material obligations.See GAO, Matter of Charter Environmental, Inc., B-297219, 5 December 2005, accessed 30 June 2020GAO, B-244993.2, B-245521.2, October 9, 1991, 9 October 1991, accessed 30 June 2020 ;Evaluation Evaluator scoring penalizes proposals that contain \\"fluff\\" or generic information that does not directly pertain to the specifics of the solicitation‚Äîthe Government's need, source selection factors and work statement or performance specification. Charts and other infographics can help a proposal. Examples would be: a six-line chart of the most compelling credentials of contractor's key personnel, or including a picture of a uniformed security guard on the pages describing contractor's uniforms. Professional proposal writers often have graphic design experience. A proposal can be too long, causing the Government's source selection authority to skim over it. The Government source selection team may not wish to spend much time on the acquisition source selection. Also, it is possible for vendors to put too much information into proposals which do not go to the heart of the acquisition, particularly information not related to the source selection criteria as well as the work statement. For simple acquisitions, Government source selection authorities have responded favorably to proposals which emphasize experience with the specific requirement that the Government is seeking to source and information on how a product or service will meet the needs of the Government as stated in the source selection factors and the work statement. Contractors must also be aware of whether or not price is more important than non-price factors. Where price is more important than non-price factors, then the lowest bidder who is technically acceptable in view of the source selection factors and work statement requirements will be selected. Where the solicitation indicates that the requirement is a best value acquisition, then a contractor must draft their proposal to emphasize how their proposed technical solution will meet each and every requirement and source selection factor. For more complex acquisitions, source selection authorities will be interested in how the contractor will produce service or non-service deliverables. Thus, staffing plans, methodology to produce, past experience, ISO certifications, and other information which shows that risks to the Government acquisition have been identified and mitigated should be rated higher than other proposals which do not show such information. However, it is important that the proposal first and foremost address the solicitation's work statement or technical specifications and source selection factors. Contractors must also be aware of the contract clauses in the contract to include requirements for specific standards which do not directly relate to the deliverables in question to include small business or minority set-aside requirements, Davis-Bacon (essentially local union labor rates must be used), specific accounting standards, specific certifications, etc. A variety of factors can affect the contracting process and the contract clauses that are used in a Federal acquisition, including: * Cost: A number of cost thresholds exist that trigger increasing degrees of complexity in the acquisition process. These thresholds include the micro-purchase threshold, the simplified acquisition threshold, and the commercial items threshold. The micro-purchase threshold, as of August 2007, is generally $3,000, with some exception. No competition or publication requirements are mandated for micro- purchases; generally, the Government Commercial Purchase Card (GCPC) can be used for these purchases under FAR Part 13. From $3,000 to $100,000, agencies may make use of Simplified Acquisition Procedures under FAR Part 13. Blanket purchase agreements, basic ordering agreements, or other contracts may be awarded under simplified procedures, which allow supplies or services to be ordered at a predetermined fair and reasonable price. The simplified acquisition threshold can be increased in situations specified in FAR Part 13, including overseas contingency operations (for example, military operations) and during nuclear/biological/radiological disasters up to the limits described in FAR Part 2, Definitions. FAR Part 13 simplified acquisition procedures can be used up to $5,000,000 ($11M under specified exceptions) under a test program in which Congress continues to reauthorize for acquisition of commercial items under FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. Items must qualify as a commercial item under the definition of FAR Part 2 and be supported by market research as specified in FAR Part 10. * Type of acquisition (FAR Part 16, Types of Contracts): There are two main types of contracts ‚Äì fixed price and cost reimbursement. In deciding which type to use, a Contracting Officer's identification of risk is key. A very well known requirement, such as for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items (in which no R&D; would be needed and there are no high risk aspects) would be best acquired using a fixed-price contract, in which a price is fixed and includes the contractor's profit; all risk of cost overrun is transferred to the contractor. A higher risk, more unknown requirement is more suited for cost reimbursement type contracts, in which the contractor is reimbursed for all costs, and is paid a fee above that amount. In this arrangement, cost overrun risk is placed mainly upon the Government. * Buying patterns: If an agency has a continuing need for a requirement over a period of time, a vehicle that permits multiple orders may be advantageous. For example, a blanket purchasing agreement (BPA) or a basic ordering agreement (BOA) as described in FAR Part 13 may be used, which allow for repeated purchases at predetermined fair and reasonable prices. Above the simplified acquisition threshold, an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract may be executed, as described in FAR Part 16.5. * Availability of existing contract vehicles: Agencies may use existing BPAs or BOAs, provided that the use is within the general scope of the contract. For example, an agency can make use of Federal Supply Schedules as described in FAR Subpart 8.4. Schedules offered by the General Services Administration (GSA) provide a number of pre-competed contract vehicles that give an immediate ability to obtain goods or services without going through the full contracting process (http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?contentId=8106&contentType;=GSA_OVERVIEW). * Mandatory Sources: FAR Part 8 discusses the mandatory use of certain sources for acquiring some types of supplies and services. These sources include the Federal Prison Industries, various vendors who hire blind and disabled persons, and Federal Supply Schedules. Certain items cannot be purchased by most agencies, such as passenger motor vehicles; all passenger motor vehicles must be purchased by GSA, unless a waiver is obtained. This is due in part to Congressional restrictions on the use of appropriated funds to purchase vehicles and the special authority that GSA has as the Federal Government's motor pool manager. * Small Businesses and Socioeconomic Issues: Contracting with small businesses and firms affected by certain socioeconomic factors require a highly complex subset of Government regulation which is described by FAR Parts 19 and 26. * Other requirements often apply to acquisitions depending upon the circumstances. These can include those listed in FAR Part 36, Construction and Architect-Engineer Contracts; FAR Part 41, Acquisition of Utility Services; and FAR Part 37, Service Contracting. Outside of a specified exception, acquisitions having a cost above the simplified acquisition threshold or the special authority under FAR Subpart 13.5 must be performed using the process specified under FAR Part 14, Sealed Bidding, or FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. * Workload of the Government contracting office and requiring activity. Contract vehicle selection (primarily indefinite duration, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) versus stand alone \\"C\\" contracts), market research, competition, use of performance incentives (or not), earned valued management system (EVMS) use, length of contract, number of options periods, simplification of source selection strategy and evaluation factors, inattention to fine acquisition details such as with regard to technical data rights, bundling of contract requirements into larger contract vehicles, and other decisions having a direct impact on acquisition outcomes including cost are frequently driven by workload of contracting and requiring activities. Bundling of requirements to reduce contracting actions in particular reduce contracting workload but necessarily create increased risks and other undesirable impacts to include reduction of potential vendors who directly accomplish the work in question (thereby increasing subcontracting and decreasing specific experience with particular categories of work by prime contractors). Overbundling also reduces competition by reducing the number of vendors willing to take responsibility as a prime integrator over areas that are not in their core business. At some point, bundling reduces vendor base to so called prime integrators who do little to none of the work in house. An acquisition plan may have numerous elements as listed in FAR 7.105; depending upon the estimated cost of the acquisition, these elements include: *Statement of need and background *Applicable conditions *Cost *Life cycle costs if applicable *Capability or performance *Delivery or performance requirements *Tradeoffs ‚Äì expected consequences of tradeoffs among cost, capability and schedule *Milestone chart depicting acquisition objectives *Plan of action *Potential sources *Competition plan ‚Äì whether full and open competition used, and if not, justification *Source selection procedures *Acquisition considerations *Potential Government furnished information, equipment or services *Security and/or force protection considerations *Budgeting and funding *Product or service description *Logistics considerations *Environmental considerations *Contract administration issues *Participants in acquisition plan preparation (including source selection committee) During the planning of an acquisition, several key aspects of the effort are decided, including: * The degree of competition required under FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements (i.e., full and open competition, full and open competition after exclusion of sources, or other than full and open competition, also called \\"sole-source\\") * Publication requirements for the acquisition (FAR Part 5, Publicizing Contract Actions) * Preparation of the SOW/PWS ‚Äì a document that specifies the \\"who, what, when, where, how\\" of the contract; it must be specific enough for the contractor to adequately price the requirement and to be enforceable in court. Measurable outcomes must be stated clearly. * Required amount and type of funding for the proposed acquisition * Contract line item number (CLIN) structure: this is generally in Section B of an issued contract that is constructed in the Uniform Contract Format. The CLIN Schedule is what the offeror prices in their offer/proposal. It is often advantageous to construct a CLIN Schedule that matches an outline of the work statement. Failure to properly structure the CLIN structure to the contents of a work statement can lead to an inability to determine how much a contractor should be paid or penalized if performance issues arise. * Source selection criteria (SSC): Source selection criteria \\"1) Represent the key areas of importance and emphasis to be considered in the source selection decision; and (2) Support meaningful comparison and discrimination between and among competing proposals.\\" (FAR 15.304, Evaluation factors and significant subfactors). *Independent Government cost estimate *Market research: Market research is a critical part of knowledge-based acquisitions. Information-driven and informed decision-making requires complete information to execute successful acquisitions. FAR Part 10, Market Research, gives guidance on the process of market research and its role in Federal acquisitions. * Acquisition Risks: Risk in contracting falls into three categories ‚Äì schedule risk, performance risk and cost risk. Risks to the acquisition, including negative past experiences, must be identified and mitigation measures and risk allocation between the Government and a potential vendor determined. * Government provided equipment, resources, support or information: Often, the Government must provide for equipment, logistics support, information, and many other items vital to performance of a contract. If there is proprietary information in the potential Government furnished information (GFI), then measures must be taken to avoid violation of applicable regulations. Effective market research assists the Government in: *understanding industry terminology, *understanding the basic concepts of the desired service or equipment item, *identifying potential contractors that provide the item *determining the correct scope of the requirement to best fit the vendor base Lack of adequate market research often results in contracts that fail to achieve the customer's expectations. Requiring activities are sometimes asked to write work statements on subject matter with which they have little experience. Persons with little knowledge as to how to conduct market research must seek training or guidance or apply the same common sense they would use if they were buying a high value item for themselves. =Stripped Down Components= 1\\\\. Work statement: Deliverable list with performance and objective specifications if not a service contract (no brand names except as example) :*Measurable outcome deliverables in a service contract :*Construction or architecture & engineering (A&E;) (FAR Part 36) :*Schedule / milestones (included in work statement) 2\\\\. CLINS matched tightly with work statement structure/outline 3\\\\. Source selection criteria =Risk= Contracting is all about risk allocation and minimizing risk to include cost, schedule and performance. The more vague the contract work statement, the more risk that the Government assumes. *Risk from Program Manager, Contracting and Investor's Perspective: Risk. A measure of the inability to achieve program objectives within defined cost and schedule constraints. Risk is associated with all aspects of the program, for example, threat, technology, design processes, Work breakdown structure (WBS) elements, etc. It has two components, the probability of failing to achieve a particular outcome, and the consequences of failing to achieve that outcome. *Risk from a Lawyer's Standpoint: Does this contract adequately describe all essential work / expectations, is there a schedule and is it enforceable? What are our remedies, if any? Requiring activities and frequently contracting officers want to get an acquisition on contract as quickly as possible; sometimes too quickly. Thus, contracting officers and acquisition attorneys will frequently have to carefully review the overall acquisition to identify risks to cost, schedule and performance and recommend mitigation measures to decrease these risk areas. *Risk from an Investor's perspective: What is my expected payoff? The larger the expected payoff, the larger the associated risk, and vice versa. An Investor, who is a shareholder in a contracting company, will seek to carefully balance the expected payoff with the associated risk, and he is incentivized to seek a large payoff, as long as the risk is acceptable. This perspective is unique in the sense that risk represents both opportunity and danger to the Investor, while it only represents danger to the Program Manager and the Lawyer. In other words, there is a misalignment in the perception of risk between the Program Manager, the Lawyer, and the Investor. It is ultimately the Investor who owns the contracting company, and this misalignment will have an effect on the Investor's behavior and the stock's performance. Requirement overbundling Cost, schedule and performance risk can be increased by over-bundling of a requirement into a single acquisition exercise. Over-bundling dries up the possible vendor base that might otherwise compete for a requirement. Thus, it is critical that an evaluation of the potential vendors who might compete for the overall work statement / deliverables be accomplished. This analysis will frequently require splitting up a requirement into different components. The bundling of a requirement also has a detrimental effect on the SSCs and CLIN structure, making it difficult to use in source selection, price evaluation and contract administration. Northern Missouri congressman Sam Graves introduced draft legislation in 2014 intended to address some of the shortcomings of excessively bundled contracts.Congress.gov, H.R.4094 - Contracting Data and Bundling Accountability Act of 2014, introduced 26 February 2014, accessed 11 July 2020 Overbundled requirements frequently suffer from very vague requirements and work statements, particularly in service contracts. In service contracts, the CLIN structure is priced on a per person per hour basis rather than on the service work deliverables themselves. Government or contractor ability to prepare cost or price estimates for vague work statements is severely limited; accordingly, the Government will negotiate a labor rate, number of people and individual qualifications for the requirement given that is the only feasible way to get an idea of cost. However, use of per person/per hour pricing for services is a poor contracting practice given the Government retains virtually all performance, cost and schedule risk given the contractor has fully performed under the CLIN statement when they provide the qualified body, rather than providing the needed service. One could argue that a CLIN statement which overbundles work in even a well written work statement and prices the work on a per person/per hour basis with limits on the numbers of person and types of qualifications the contractor can use is in contradiction to the work statement given the means the Government has asked the contractor to price the contract bears no relationship to the actual work itself and the Government is directing the contractor on how to execute the requirement ‚Äì thus interfering with contractor performance and a sign of an employee-employer relationship rather than an independent contracting relationship. Also, the CLIN structure which prices on a per person basis or per hour basis generally pays for such persons on an annual basis rather than merely for the service on an a la carte or as-needed basis, therefore driving up costs in many cases. Pricing on a per person or per hour basis is a sign that a contract likely also qualifies as a personal services contract under FAR Part 37 ‚Äì technically violating at least the spirit, if not the letter, of the Classification Act and FAR Part 37 except in specific circumstances and with specific determinations and findings. Use of prime integrators in overbundled contracts sometimes has led to poor results in a number of major systems acquisitions. For example, what would happen if say the US Navy went too far in allowing contractors to make choices that make economic sense in the specific acquisition but add cost to the overall Navy? Example is a prime integrator who gets a good deal on a specific radar system that is not used in any other ship system ‚Äì makes this specific buy cheaper but overall this costs the Navy a great deal of money given a lack of interoperability that drives a need to stand up training schools, supply system, work force increase, etc. Over-bundling makes it easy for contracting, but many times, especially for complex acquisitions, does not deliver the results expected by the customer or war fighter for complex acquisitions, especially acquisitions that the acquisition command in question has little experience with or has substantial turn over of personnel during the life of the acquisition. Small business acquisitions have mandatory restrictions on over-bundling. However, non-small business acquisitions are not subject to the same rules. Example of how over- bundling causes big problems (permutations and evaluation of total price in source selection): Lets say a requiring activity wants to get polling services. Acquisition planning reveals there are five polls in ten different regions. However, it turns out that the Government will only be ordering one of the five polls in any real numbers and that particular poll is much more expensive in actual cost than the other four. If a weighting scheme is not applied to this bundled requirement, a vendor can make the four lightly ordered polls very cheap in their offer and the high volume poll very expensive, based on their knowledge of the ordering patterns of the Government in past acquisitions. Thus, on its face, the overall price of a bid when each poll is added together to arrive at a total price (used in source selection) would look attractive but in practice, the Government will burn through its budget very quickly given the vast majority of the actually ordered polls are extremely expensive (even though the actual cost of the most frequently ordered poll is far less than what was in the offer). To avoid the headache of a weighting scheme, all five polls should be broken apart and contracted for separately so they can be judged on their merits. This is an example of what is frequently done on major indefinite duration, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts and explains why some acquisitions are appallingly expensive and require additional funding to achieve the requiring activity's objectives. Statement of work The statement of work (SOW) is a formal document submitted along with the request for proposal (RFP) to a vendor that defines the work to be performed, the location of the work, the deliverable schedule, applicable performance standards, any special requirements (e.g., security clearances, travel, and special knowledge), and the period of performance.FAR 8.405-2 Ordering procedures for services requiring a statement of work. accessed July 8, 2011 Source selection Source selection refers to the process for evaluating contractor proposals or quotes submitted in response to a request for proposals (RFP) or request for quotes (RFQ) based on the contract solicitation. Source selection is driven by what instructions to offerors clause is included in the contract solicitation (e.g., FAR 52.212-2 with the tailored language spelling out what the source selection criteria are, weighting, etc.). After the requiring activity has written their SOW/PWS, figured out source selection approach, then selected factors and subfactors, then figured out weighting of non cost/price factors, then understood consequences of the above, they write a source selection plan (SSP). A SSP gives instructions to a source selection committee on how to evaluate each proposal. Courts will defer to the source selection committee's business judgment, so facts must be included to base a decision on; the source selection committee must not be arbitrary or lack facts in the record for their findings. Ultimately, risk evaluation is where a source selection team wants to be. That is what is used to determine weakness, significant weakness and deficiencies, which are briefed to unsuccessful offerors. Making the connection between risk evaluation/source selection criteria/factors and offeror proposals is what source selection is all about The process used for source selection can be selected from FAR Parts 13, Simplified Acquisition, 14, Sealed Bidding or 15, Contracting by Negotiation. Contractors competing for a Government requirement have an opportunity to request clarification or amendment of a work statement or solicitation. The request for clarification must be done relatively early in the acquisition process, preferably as close to the publication of a solicitation, RFQ, RFP or other publication. Frequently contracting officers will agree to such clarifications if a contractor's request is well reasoned. Key principles for source selection: * Tell them what basis you are going to award it on (award criteria) (tell them) * Award it based on what you said you would award it based on (do what you said you would do) * Document what you did. (Tell them that you did what you said you would do in the first place) More is better as long as it makes sense. * If discussions are held, read the bid protests on discussions first to make sure you understand how to do it. *Formulation of a Competitive Range, defined at FAR 15.306(c)(1) as comprising \\"all of the most highly rated proposals\\",FAR 15.306 Exchanges with offerors after receipt of proposals., accessed 28 July 2020 a tool which may enable uncompetitive proposals to be eliminated from further consideration. FAR 15.209 states that if the Government intends to make award after exchanges with offerers after receipt of proposals, due notice of the intention to \\"conduct discussions with offerors whose proposals have been determined to be within the competitive range\\" must be provided.FAR, - competitive-acquisition 52.215-1 Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition, Alternate 1 (October 1997), accessed 28 July 2020 Notification procedures at 15.503(a) and debriefing procedures at FAR 15.305(c)(4) to FAR 15.306(c) must be followed in respect of offers excluded from the competitive range. If a competitive range is used, COs must send pre-award notifications to offerors thus excluded. An agency entering into discussions must provide \\"meaningful discussions\\".See GAO decisions on this issue If FAR Part 15 is used, there must be a proposal evaluation under FAR 15.305 to include a \\"fair and reasonable\\" price determination under FAR 15.305(a)(1), a past performance evaluation under FAR 15.305(a)(2) and a technical evaluation under FAR 15.305(a)(3). For each factor rating, identify each offeror's key strengths, uncertainties and deficiencies of the proposal and then explain how the strengths, uncertainties and deficiencies resulted in that rating. Focus specifically on the factors and subfactors specifically stated in the solicitation/instructions to offerors. Do not use unstated source selection criteria to select the winning offer. Discuss those discriminators that make one offeror better than another based on the selection criteria. Be as detailed and focused upon discriminators as the source selection results allow. If something was not a discriminator then say so and also state why it was not. If the strength had no bearing on the offeror's rating, state so. Adequately address the impact of past performance on the decision; remember, no past performance is rated NEUTRAL!! A drafter of the source selection decision document must show the source selection authority's thought process and reasons behind the comparative analysis. Use a declaration of thinking/intent on the part of the source selection authority (SSA). For example: I selected; I thought; I determined; I reviewed; etc. Source selections cannot compare the offers against each other, only against the award criteria. Spend some time on the summary to make it correct as it is very important. It is meant to very quickly put in words the best of the key discriminators used by the SSA to reach their decision. Don't focus the discussion on only one offeror. The Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD) compares assessments of the successful offeror against the others. If there are a large number of offerors, the detailed discussion may be limited to the most highly rated offerors. Some light discussion of lower rated offerors is needed when a competitive range is not established. Don't use ratings with contradicting supporting language, such as a \\"not detailed\\" rated \\"excellent.\\" Examine ratings closely as they relate to your technical discussions. Ensure they are consistent (i.e., avoid having a weakness discussed in one proposal evaluation and not another proposal having the same weakness). Don't identify or list weaknesses without discussing them and their importance to the thought process. Don't treat a neutral performance confidence assessment favorably or unfavorably. (Don't disqualify an offeror for having a neutral rating.) No past performance must be rated as neutral under FAR Part 13 and FAR Subpart 15.3. Ensure that, when documenting an award decision in the SSDD, SSA's are focusing on the underlying advantages and disadvantages of the proposals rather than merely the ratings themselves. HoveCo, B-298697: http://www.gao.gov/decisions/bidpro/298697.pdf Agency regulations frequently provide guidance on source selections: See for example, AFARS 5115.308 Source selection decision ‚Äì \\"A source selection decision document must be prepared for all source selections and reflect the SSA's integrated assessment and decision. The document must be the single summary document supporting selection of the best value proposal consistent with the stated evaluation criteria. It must clearly explain the decision and documents the reasoning used by the SSA to reach a decision. The document should be releasable to the General Accounting Office and others authorized to receive proprietary and source selection information. When releasing a copy to offerors or to anyone not authorized to receive proprietary and source selection information, redacted material should be limited to that which is proprietary and that which must continue to be protected as source selection information.\\" Consistency: what is bad for one proposal is bad for all; find an adverse comment, then look at of the proposals of the other bidders and see if the same problem exists in there and was not written up in the evaluation for those proposals. What is good for one proposal is good for all proposals (See above) Take a hard look at definitions in instructions given to source selection committee ‚Äì look at the words in them; start with the worst definition, i.e., unacceptable, look at the words in it, then see if those words show up in evaluations that are rated higher than that definition in the rating worksheets. If you have something bad in the proposal you want to win, then acknowledge it in your source decision document, and STATE THAT IT DID NOT AFFECT YOUR DECISION OF X REGARDING RATING OF THAT PROPOSAL!!! ‚Äì if the same thing is bad in another proposal, then say the same thing in that one as well. The word \\"non-responsive\\" IS ONLY USED IN SEALED BIDDING! It should NEVER be used in FAR Parts 13 or 15 evaluation processes. Packages missing things are just rated lower for example, poor, good, unacceptable or IAW FAR of weakness, significant weakness, etc. Compare SOW and delivery schedules on solicitation (for example, RFP/RFQ) to what is in proposals word for word to see if everything was addressed. State if something is missing to justify lower ratings; talk about everything that applies for each award criteria to \\"pile on\\" good comments for proposals you like; then show that more good was said about the ones you liked, and less good was said about the ones you don't. Do the best you can with bad source selection or award criteria. Just make sure it is consistently applied = Source Selection Criteria = Source Selection Criteria (SSC) can be simple or complex depending on the subject of the acquisition. If FAR Part 15 is used, then a concept called best value can be used; best value simply is an idea that the lowest bidder is not necessarily the winner of a competition ‚Äì rather, an evaluation of the overall offer based on specified SSCs is accomplished and a source selection decision is accomplished (see below) based on those specified SSCs using a fact-based business judgement of the acquiring activity. SSCs can vary widely in complexity depending on the acquisition process used, for example, FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition, or FAR Part 15, Negotiated Procurement. For example, under FAR Part 15, there is a range of source selection models including: # Lowest Price (LP) that is Technically Acceptable (TA) based on statement of work (SOW) (LPTA) (use this for VERY SIMPLE BUYS ‚Äì for example, pencils) # LPTA with Past Performance (partial tradeoff) (more complicated) # Full Tradeoff based on LP, TA, past performance and stated criteria including SOW (VERY COMPLICATED BUYS) (sometimes known as best value) ##Do not have to select lowest price ##Can select higher priced proposal that provides better solution to objectives ##A Business Judgment-based decision with rational basis If FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition is used, then a contracting officer can select from a range of processes including Government Purchase Card (GPC) for purchases under the micro-purchase threshold (see definition section of FAR for current value (for example, in U.S., it is currently $2,500), simplified acquisition threshold (see FAR definition section, currently up to $150,000 within the U.S. with certain exceptions), or up to $6.5M for commercial items/services. Under FAR Part 13, contracting officers are not required to use FAR Part 15 processes or follow the publication requirements of FAR Part 5, however they MUST create their own processes to follow. Vendor past performance is generally included as a source selection criteria. It is important to include a requirement for \\"recent and relevant\\" past performance. Inadequate SSCs renders the best work statement and CLIN worthless. Metrics/performance measures A metric is a meaningful measurement taken over a period of time that communicates vital information about a process or activity, leading to fact-based decisions. Focus on where things go bad ‚Äì not resource effective to measure everything. Instead, select the critical few metrics for mission essential processes, process that have historically experienced chronic problems or process choke points and monitor them. * Characteristics of a good metric: **Meaningful to the customer **Simple, understandable, logical and repeatable **Shows a trend **Clearly defined **Data that's economical to collect **Timely **Drives appropriate action (this is most important feature of a good metric) **Shows how organizational goals and objectives are being met through tasks and processes Contract management Contract administration Contract administration tasks can include: * Payments (prompt payment essential) ‚Äì frequently Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) is used. * Modifications and Adjustments, typically done using a changes clause * Includes Requests for Equitable Adjustments (can process under FAR 49.002(c)) (these are essentially modifications under the applicable contract changes clause e.g., FAR 52.212-4 clause) * Terminations for cause or convenience ‚Äì for commercial items, you use the terminations clauses in the 52.212-4 clause. * Bid protests, ratifications and contract claims See the DCMA Handbook for more information on contract administration.  Requests for Equitable Adjustments  Requests for Equitable Adjustments (REAs) are modifications of the contract that were not done formally or properly. REAs are frequently based on the changes clause. They typically occur when new work is added or a change in current work is ordered, perhaps by the contracting officer, without the required documentation. Changed circumstances and equity are possible justifications for a contractor to ask for a REA. Contractors can ask for delay damages arising from contract changes in REAs. The burden of showing evidence of increased costs lies with the contractor. Special rules exist for entitlement to whether or not contractor is entitled to profit in addition to the actual costs they incurred, especially in the cases of leased equipment that was held over due to delays on the part of the Government or the Government's failure to properly integrate other contractors who then interfered with our contractor's work. Cases out there that say the Government can reduce profit if risk was reduced due to the change. Can use the settlement procedures in FAR Part 49, per FAR 49.002(c) but be advised that this section is really written for terminations ‚Äì you have to adapt the settlement procedures, probably for terminations for convenience, to the REA. The Government should make sure there is a release of claims (ROC) clause in the REA's contract modification ‚Äì FAR / DFARS do not have a sample ROC clause. In the context of FAR Part 12 commercial items, the changes clause requires bilateral agreement. A substantial number of Federal cases deal with REAs: * \\"It is black letter law that every contract with the Government contains an implied obligation that neither party will do anything to prevent, hinder, or delay performance.\\" Sterling Millwrights, Inc. v. United States, 26 Cl.Ct. 49, 67 (1992) (citing Lewis-Nicholson, Inc. v. United States, 213 Ct.Cl. 192, 550 F.2d 26, 32 (1977)). * When Government actions delay contractor performance and increase costs, \\"the contractor has a claim for damages.\\" (Lewis-Nicholson, 550 F.2d at 26). * \\"A constructive change generally arises where the Government, without more, expressly or impliedly orders the contractor to perform work that is not specified in the contract documents.\\" Lathan, 20 Cl.Ct. at 128 (citing Chris Berg, Inc. v. United States, 197 Ct.Cl. 503, 525, 455 F.2d 1037, 1050 (1972)). * Contractors may recover excess costs through an equitable adjustment, however, it \\"bears the burden of proving liability, causation, and resultant injury.\\" Ralph L. Jones, 33 Fed.Cl. at 331 (citing Wunderlich Contracting Co. v. United States, 173 Ct.Cl. 180, 199, 351 F.2d 956 (1965); Electronic & Missile Facilities, Inc. v. United States, 189 Ct.Cl. 237, 253, 416 F.2d 1345 (1969)). * The standard of meeting this burden is high. Before an equitable adjustment will be granted, contractors must demonstrate: (1) increased costs arose from conditions materially different from what the contract documents indicated and that such conditions were reasonably unforeseeable based on all information available to the contractor; and (2) the changes in the requirements caused the increased costs in question. Johns-Manville Corp. v. United States, 12 Cl.Ct. 1, 33 (1987). * A contractor must distinguish for the court those delays for which the Government is responsible as opposed to its own; the contractor's standard for proving damages does not require \\"absolute exactness or mathematical precision.\\" Ralph L. Jones, 33 Fed.Cl. at 336 (quoting Electronic & Missile, 189 Ct.Cl. at 257). * The court \\"needs only enough evidence to make a fair and reasonable estimate.\\" Id. (citing Miller Elevator, 30 Fed.Cl. at 702; Electronic & Missile, 189 Ct.Cl. at 257). Modifications Two types of scope determinations in contracts. One is scope of the original contract ‚Äì meaning, do we have to pay anything for this modification. The second one is whether or not the modification or change is within the scope of the original competition. The first issue comes up when a contractor demands more money (i.e., demand for more money in a CDA claim or REA); the second issue comes up when the Government wishes to modify the contract and the contractor agrees, but another contractor objects to the failure to recompete the contract. Modifications are governed by the changes clause in the contract. However, the question of competitive scope must be determined first to determine if there will be a Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) violation first. As a collateral issue, the question of whether or not the modification is a good deal must be evaluated because any modification is inherently a sole source award to the incumbent contractor. Thus, there is no price competition for the modification. If the acquisition was done under FAR Part 12, Commercial Items, the Government has no ability to demand cost and pricing information from the Contractor to evaluate whether or not the contractor is ripping off the Government with inflated or padded charges. With regard to competitive scope determinations, the GAO in American Air Filter Co., 57 Comp. Gen 567 (B-188408), 78‚Äì1, para 443, at 573, stated: \\"The impact of any modification is in our view to be determined by examining whether the alteration is within the scope of the competition which was initially conducted. Ordinarily, a modification falls within the scope of the procurement provided that it is of a nature which potential offerors would have reasonably anticipated under the changes clause. To determine what potential offerors would have reasonably expected, consideration should be given to the procurement format used, the history of the present and related past procurements, and the nature of the supplies or services sought. A variety of factors may be pertinent, including: whether the requirement was appropriate initially for an advertised or negotiated procurement; whether a standard off the shelf or similar item is sought; or whether, for example, the contract is one for research and development, suggesting that broad changes might be expected because the Government's requirement are at best only indefinite.\\" GAO issued a decision on 31 Jan 06 in DOR Biodefense Inc. and Emergent BioSolutions, B-296358.3 and B-296358.4 regarding whether a modification is within the scope of the original competition under the Competition In Contracting Act (CICA). Modifications outside the scope of the original competition must be competed or justified as sole source actions. Scope analysis is not mechanical, but requires an integrated assessment of multiple factors, including contract type, specification or statement of work, cost and performance period. Whether the modification requires competition also depends upon whether the original solicitation adequately advised offerors of the potential for that type of change, and thus whether the modification would have changed the field of competition. In Biodefense, the Army issued a single award ten year indefinite quantity contract for development and certification of vaccines for biological defense. The challenged modification was exercise of an optional CLIN for development of a type of vaccine not expressly listed in the solicitation's option that extended the performance period for the option by 8 years at a significant increase in cost. The GAO determined that this modification was, nevertheless, within the overall scope of the original competition based on the broad developmental purpose of the contract and the solicitation's express notice to offerors that additional vaccine types could be added after award and that changes in regulation may affect performance period and costs. The discussion of actions taken by the Army in the original solicitation to put competitors on notice of the potential for post-award modifications provides good practice insight. See DOR Biodefense, Inc.; Emergent BioSolutions: http://www.gao.gov/decisions/bidpro/2963583.pdf See DCMA's Contract Administration Handbook for more information: https://web.archive.org/web/20070807083159/http://guidebook.dcma.mil/15/instructions.htm Claims =Release of a claim= Release of Claims In consideration of the premises contained in contract modification number _______________ of contract number ______________________________, executed on _____________, and sum of $______________to be paid by the United States Government under the above noted contract, the undersigned contractor does release and discharge the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of, from all liabilities, obligations, and claims whatsoever in law and equity arising out of or by virtue of said contract, except as follows: [fill this in or state ‚Äì no exceptions] IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this release has been executed this ___ day of _________. __________________________ Contractor Signature = Contract Disputes Act = Contract claims are handled under the disputes clause in commercial items contracts or another clause in different types of contracts. The clause simply refers to another clause, the contract dispute clause. That clause invokes the Contract Disputes Act (CDA) and specific procedures that must be followed. The Government seeks to avoid treating requests for additional money or changes to the contract as a claim, for several reasons. For starters, the Government has to pay interest from the date of receipt to the date of payment. Second, if the amount is over a specified amount, then the claim must be certified (see the FAR and CDA). Certification is essentially a company swearing under pain of 18 USC false claims act penalties that they are not falsifying the claim. Instead of dealing with it as a claim, the Government should deal with it as a REA; the contractor will have to decide what is more advantageous to it ‚Äì a REA or CDA claim. Cancellation of contract Contractors are understandably quite upset when an awarded contract is cancelled before contract performance can begin. There is some authority for a contractor to recover bid preparation costs in very limited circumstances. Even so, a contracting agency need only establish a reasonable basis to support a decision to cancel an RFQ; in this regard, so long as there is a reasonable basis for doing so, an agency may cancel an RFQ no matter when the information precipitating the cancellation first arises, even if it is not until quotations have been submitted and evaluated. Quality Tech., Inc., B-292883.2, Jan. 21, 2004, 2004 CPD para. 29 at 2‚Äì3; Datatrak Consulting, Inc., B-292502 et al., September 26, 2003, 2003 CPD para. 169 at 5. It is well established that an agency's lack of funding for a procurement provides a reasonable basis for cancellation, as agencies cannot award contracts which exceed available funds. First Enter., B-221502.3, Mar. 24, 1986, 86-1 CPD para. 290 at 3. Procurement authorities are presumed to act in good faith and in order for GAO to conclude otherwise, the record must show that procuring officials intended to injure the protester. Cycad Corp., B‚Äë255870, April 12, 1994, 94-1 CPD para. 253 at 5. A protester's mere inference of bad faith is insufficient. Terminations The Government may terminate a contract for cause (commercial items), for default (T4D) or for convenience (T4C). Terminations for commercial items (FAR Part 12) contracts are governed by FAR 52.212-4(l) and (m), not the T4C or T4D clauses of FAR 52.249-x. FAR Part 49 prescribes T4D and T4C clauses in FAR Part 52 for non-commercial items (FAR Part 12) related contracts. In particular, T4D is covered by FAR Subpart 49.4, Terminations for Default. T4C is covered by several sections of FAR Part 49. Termination for default reviews can be done a variety of ways, however, one method is to start with what is the ACTUAL deliverable on the contract, not the one that the customer thought they had. Carefully track what the contractor's actual performance is against the specific language in the contract. If there has been verbal changes by the Government without going through the contracting officer (which should never happen), is there something that indicates the contractor consented to those changes? In writing? For example, the DFARS 252.212-4 clause section that deals with modifications states that mutual consent is required for all modifications. In this review, use the language from the contract and then see if you have adequate evidence from the Government documenting the actual performance. Ask if the Government COR has signed any receiving reports e.g., DD Form 250s accepting performance (so they can get paid). Is there anything in the record that shows the Government placed the contractor on notice of their default or non conforming deliveries? FAR Part 49 should be read that to get information on terminations including notice to cure and show cause notices. The more the Government tries to give the contractor chances to remedy their default, the more the Government bolsters its case that T4D is appropriate. The various courts that review T4Ds have a high standard of review for T4Ds, so the Government should consider making sure the T4D is well supported and the Government has had little or no role in the contractors non-conforming performance as well as ensuring there is a clearly defined deliverable, several chances to cure and nothing in the record that indicates the Government failed to do something that was condition precedent to performance or the Government interfered with contract performance or failed to provide required cooperation/support. (For example, failure to provide security escorts or access to a work site thus causing delays on the part of Contractor performance). The key point for T4Ds is that it is the only way that a Government agency can use prior year single year appropriated funds, such as O&M; or many types of procurement funds, for reprocurement of the item in question. Accordingly, it is very important the Agency get the acquisition right up front because bad work statements and poor contract administration destroy the Government's ability to T4D, thus keep their prior year funds to get a replacement contractor. Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) has a Terminations Handbook which is very useful in dealing with terminations for convenience issues. Real options analysis One approach to analysing Government procurements of large systems, such as weapons systems, is to use real options analysis.Arnold, Scot, and Marius Vassiliou (2010). A Real Options Approach to valuing the Risk Transfer in a Multi-Year Procurement Contract. Ch. 25 in Thawar T. Arif (ed), Aerospace Technologies Advancements. Zagreb, Croatia: INTECH, pp. 475-492. .Arnold, Scot, and Marius Vassiliou (2007). Real Options Analysis of Multiyear Procurements,√Æ Proc. 2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference. Such procurements can be done in single annual lots (\\"single-year procurements,\\" or SYPs), or, with Congressional approval, multi- year procurement (MYP) contracts. Multi-year contracts generally lower the risk for the contractor, and thus the unit price paid by the Government. One way to look at this situation is that a multi-year contract contains a real option for the contractor to escape the uncertainty associated with a sequence of single-year contract negotiations (analogous to a put option). Real options analysis can give an estimate of the value to the contractor of transferring revenue risk to the Government as a function of the contract's size and the volatility of the contract's value, even though the option is not actively traded. The negotiated price is also influenced by the attitudes towards risk of the negotiating parties.

Seferlis (1930-2005) is acknowledged as a master sculptor and stone carver whose works exemplified a group of public monumental artists in the United States during the second half of the 20th century. Many of these stone masters were immigrants, primarily from southern Europe, including Italy and Greece, and they trained and worked in the classical milieu. Seferlis himself was born near Sparta, Greece, and, because of his precocious talent, was enrolled at an early age in the National Academy of Fine Arts in Athens. It was at the National Academy that Seferlis developed his artistic voice, his naturalistic style, and his love for the medium of stone. The National Cathedral Seferlis immigrated to the Washington, D.C., area in the latter part of the 1950s. His talent, grace, and humor were already evident in the sculptures he carved at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, his first job in the United States. Two years later, his art truly began to blossom and mature as he started work on the National Cathedral. Over the next two decades, he worked on the Cathedral‚Äôs various ongoing interior and exterior construction projects. The National Cathedral was declared completed in 1990, almost nine decades after the cornerstone was laid, though restoration, elaboration, and intense maintenance continue to the present day. Seferlis‚Äô contributions to the Cathedral take the form of limestone gargoyles, grotesques, capitals, pinnacles, saints, angels, keystones, bosses, column capitals, and freestanding figural sculptures of historical personages such as Helen Keller and Pope John XXIII. The Smithsonian Castle on the National Mall In addition to the Shrine and the Cathedral, Seferlis enthusiastically undertook a number of high-profile restoration projects on both public and private buildings. He carved elaborate capitals used in restoring the Corinthian columns of the east front of the U.S. Capitol building. Under the auspices of the National Park Service, he worked on restoring or replacing a number of the almost 200 historical commemorative stones that line the granite interior of the Washington Monument. For the Smithsonian Institution, Seferlis worked on renovating the fa√ßade of the emblematic Smithsonian Castle; carved exterior gates and finials; and restored the statue of St. Dunstan donated to the Institution by Westminster Abbey. The fountain in Dupont Circle depicting the seas and the stars. The wind is on the north side. He also restored and renovated a number of famous fountains in the Washington, D.C., area, including the Dupont Circle fountain and the swan fountain in the French parterre at Hillwood Museum and Gardens (the Washington residence of Marjorie Merriweather Post). Seferlis mounted several major exhibitions at prestigious venues, including the National Academy of Design and National Sculpture Society in New York. As a result of his highly regarded figural and ornamental sculptures, he was awarded a number of sought-after prizes in recognition of his artistic contributions. In 1971, he was inducted into the National Sculpture Society, followed by membership in the National Academy of Design in 1974. Seferlis‚Äô works, along with those of his colleagues, were highlighted for a wider audience in the documentary, ‚ÄúThe Stone Carvers‚Äù (1984). This half-hour-long film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary, Short Subjects in 1985 for filmmakers Marjorie Hunt and Paul Wagner. After being broadcast on public television, the short also won an Emmy. Despite being continuously occupied with projects around the country and in his suburban Maryland studio, Seferlis managed to find the time and patience to guide aspiring artists and to mentor young talents. Many famous (and unsung) stone carvers working today at preserving and advancing the craft readily acknowledge his influence. He also reached out to the public to make them aware of the importance of stone carving and the arts in general by teaching at a number of museums, academic institutions, and continuing education programs in Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia. Among his many students was his own son Andy. Mr. Seferlis died in March 2005. References  External links  * Seferlis' profile at the Stone Carvers Guild website.

For information on the church associated with the Blagoveschenskaya Tower in Russia, see Kremlin towers or Cathedral of the Annunciation. The Church of the Annunciation (, , , Ekklis√≠a tou Evangelismo√∫ tis Theot√≥kou), sometimes also referred to as the Basilica of the Annunciation, is a Catholic Church in Nazareth, in northern Israel. It was established over the site where the Catholic tradition holds to be the house of Virgin Mary, and where angel Gabriel appeared to her and announced that she would conceive and bear the Son of God, Jesus ‚Äì an event known as the Annunciation. History Tradition The church was established at the site where, according to one tradition, the Annunciation took place. Another tradition, based on the apocryphal Protoevangelium of James, holds that this event commenced while Mary was drawing water from a local spring in Nazareth, and the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation was erected at that alternate site. Late Roman/Byzantine shrine The first shrine was probably built sometime in the middle of the 4th century, comprising an altar in the cave in which Mary had lived. Christian tradition has held that a larger structure was commissioned by Emperor Constantine I, whose mother, Saint Helena, helped to found churches commemorating important events in Jesus Christ's life. The Church of the Annunciation was founded around the same time as the Church of the Nativity (the birthplace) and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (the tomb). Some version of it was known to have still been in existence around 570 AD, but it was destroyed in the 7th century after the Muslim conquest of Palestine. Crusader church The second church was built over the ruins of the Byzantine era church during the Crusades, following the conquest of Nazareth by Tancred in 1102.Emmett, 1995, p. 100. The Crusader era church was never fully completed. Five Romanesque capitals carved by artists from northern France, and discovered during excavations in 1909, had not yet been installed in 1187 when news of Saladin's victory in the Battle of Hittin reached the city. Saladin granted permission to Franciscan priests to remain in Nazareth to oversee services at the church. In 1260, Baybars and his Mamluk army destroyed the church during their attack on Nazareth. Mamluk and early Ottoman period A small number of Franciscans managed to stay in Nazareth until the fall of Acre in 1291. In the three centuries that followed, the Franciscans were in and out of Nazareth, depending on the local political situation, which was constantly in flux. Franciscan accounts of this period document their expulsion in 1363, their return in 1468 and a massacre of some of their members in 1542. Local Christian families with Franciscan support took care of the holy site even during this difficult period.Emmett, 1995, p. 101. 17th- and 18th-century churches The Church of the Annunciation, interior (about 1925) Emir Fakhr ad-Din granted the Franciscans permission to return to Nazareth and the church ruins in 1620, at which time they constructed a small structure to enclose the holy grotto that is venerated as the house of Mary. In 1730, Dahir al-Umar permitted construction of a new church, which became a central gathering place for Nazareth Latin community. The church was enlarged in 1877. 20th-century basilica The old church was completely demolished in 1954 to allow for the construction of a new basilica, which was completed in 1969, after being dedicated in 1964 by Pope Paul VI. The new basilica was designed by the Italian architect Giovanni Muzio, and built by the Israeli building firm Solel Boneh during the years 1960‚Äì1969. The Chief Engineer at this project was Ing. Shlomo Lopatin (Aluf) who was dedicated to the Basilica building process for more than 10 years, and it was indeed his life-project. It is built in a style sometimes characterised as Italian Brutalism. Used by the Latin parish, it remains under the control of the Franciscans. It is the largest Christian sanctuary in the Middle East. Significance and rank Under Canon Law, the church enjoys the status of a minor basilica.Norms for the Granting of the Title of Minor Basilica, Adoremus Bulletin, December 31, 2007. Adoremus, Society for the Renewal of the Sacred Liturgy. Retrieved 9 April 2020. A historically significant site, considered sacred within some circles of Christianity, particularly Catholicism, the basilica attracts many Catholic, Anglican, and Eastern Orthodox Christian visitors every year. Description The current Catholic Church is a two-storey building finished in 1969 over the site of earlier churches from the Byzantine, Crusader, and Ottoman-period churches. Lower church The lower level contains the Grotto of the Annunciation, believed by many Christians to be the remains of the original childhood home of Mary. Upper church The upper level contains a number of images of Mary, mainly mosaics, each from a different country with significant Catholic population. Courtyard gallery of Madonnas On the walls enclosing the courtyard of the basilica, there is a gallery with icons (mainly mosaics, but also some made of ceramic tiles) representing some of the most important Marian devotions in different countries. Some of the main Marian devotions from Spain are included: the Virgin of Candelaria, patron saint of the Canary Islands;Cristianos en Tierra Santa the Virgin of Montserrat, patroness of Catalonia; the Virgin of the Forsaken, patroness of Valencia; and the Virgin of Guadalupe, patroness of Extremadura.La patrona extreme√±a ser√° entronizada en la bas√≠lica de la Anunciaci√≥n Mass arrangements As of November 2018, Catholic Masses are given in the Grotto, Upper Basilica, and adjacent St. Joseph's Church in the Arabic and Italian languages, according to the main church sign in English.

It is named for German mathematician and aerodynamicist Martin Kutta. Kuethe and Schetzer state the Kutta condition as follows: :A body with a sharp trailing edge which is moving through a fluid will create about itself a circulation of sufficient strength to hold the rear stagnation point at the trailing edge. In fluid flow around a body with a sharp corner, the Kutta condition refers to the flow pattern in which fluid approaches the corner from both directions, meets at the corner, and then flows away from the body. None of the fluid flows around the sharp corner. The Kutta condition is significant when using the Kutta‚ÄìJoukowski theorem to calculate the lift created by an airfoil with a sharp trailing edge. The value of circulation of the flow around the airfoil must be that value which would cause the Kutta condition to exist.  The Kutta condition applied to airfoils  Comparison of zero-circulation flow pattern around an airfoil; and the flow pattern with circulation consistent with the Kutta condition, in which both the upper and lower flows leave the trailing edge smoothly. Applying 2-D potential flow, if an airfoil with a sharp trailing edge begins to move with an angle of attack through air, the two stagnation points are initially located on the underside near the leading edge and on the topside near the trailing edge, just as with the cylinder. As the air passing the underside of the airfoil reaches the trailing edge it must flow around the trailing edge and along the topside of the airfoil toward the stagnation point on the topside of the airfoil. Vortex flow occurs at the trailing edge and, because the radius of the sharp trailing edge is zero, the speed of the air around the trailing edge should be infinitely fast. Though real fluids cannot move at infinite speed, they can move very fast. The high airspeed around the trailing edge causes strong viscous forces to act on the air adjacent to the trailing edge of the airfoil and the result is that a strong vortex accumulates on the topside of the airfoil, near the trailing edge. As the airfoil begins to move it carries this vortex, known as the starting vortex, along with it. Pioneering aerodynamicists were able to photograph starting vortices in liquids to confirm their existence.Millikan, Clark B. (1941) Aerodynamics of the Airplane, Figure 1.55, John Wiley & SonsPrandtl, L., and Tietjens, O.G. (1934) Applied Hydro- and Aero-mechanics, Figures 42-55, McGraw-Hill Massey, B.S. Mechanics of Fluids. Fig 9.33, 2nd Edition The vorticity in the starting vortex is matched by the vorticity in the bound vortex in the airfoil, in accordance with Kelvin's circulation theorem.A.M. Kuethe and J.D. Schetzer (1959) Foundations of Aerodynamics, 2nd edition, John Wiley & Sons As the vorticity in the starting vortex progressively increases the vorticity in the bound vortex also progressively increases and causes the flow over the topside of the airfoil to increase in speed. The starting vortex is soon cast off the airfoil and is left behind, spinning in the air where the airfoil left it. The stagnation point on the topside of the airfoil then moves until it reaches the trailing edge. The starting vortex eventually dissipates due to viscous forces. As the airfoil continues on its way, there is a stagnation point at the trailing edge. The flow over the topside conforms to the upper surface of the airfoil. The flow over both the topside and the underside join up at the trailing edge and leave the airfoil travelling parallel to one another. This is known as the Kutta condition.Clancy, L.J. Aerodynamics, Sections 4.5 and 4.8 When an airfoil is moving with an angle of attack, the starting vortex has been cast off and the Kutta condition has become established, there is a finite circulation of the air around the airfoil. The airfoil is generating lift, and the magnitude of the lift is given by the Kutta‚ÄìJoukowski theorem. One of the consequences of the Kutta condition is that the airflow over the topside of the airfoil travels much faster than the airflow under the underside. A parcel of air which approaches the airfoil along the stagnation streamline is cleaved in two at the stagnation point, one half traveling over the topside and the other half traveling along the underside. The flow over the topside is so much faster than the flow along the underside that these two halves never meet again. They do not even re-join in the wake long after the airfoil has passed. This is sometimes known as \\"cleavage\\". There is a popular fallacy called the equal transit-time fallacy that claims the two halves rejoin at the trailing edge of the airfoil. This fallacy is in conflict with the phenomenon of cleavage that has been understood since Martin Kutta's discovery. Whenever the speed or angle of attack of an airfoil changes there is a weak starting vortex which begins to form, either above or below the trailing edge. This weak starting vortex causes the Kutta condition to be re- established for the new speed or angle of attack. As a result, the circulation around the airfoil changes and so too does the lift in response to the changed speed or angle of attack.\\"This starting vortex formation occurs not only when a wing is first set into motion, but also when the circulation around the wing is subsequently changed for any reason whatever.\\" Millikan, Clark B. (1941), Aerodynamics of the Airplane, p.65, John Wiley & Sons, New York The Kutta condition gives some insight into why airfoils usually have sharp trailing edges, even though this is undesirable from structural and manufacturing viewpoints. In irrotational, inviscid, incompressible flow (potential flow) over an airfoil, the Kutta condition can be implemented by calculating the stream function over the airfoil surface.Farzad Mohebbi and Mathieu Sellier (2014) \\"On the Kutta Condition in Potential Flow over Airfoil\\", Journal of Aerodynamics Farzad Mohebbi (2018) \\"FOILincom: A fast and robust program for solving two dimensional inviscid steady incompressible flows (potential flows) over isolated airfoils\\", . The same Kutta condition implementation method is also used for solving two dimensional subsonic (subcritical) inviscid steady compressible flows over isolated airfoils.Farzad Mohebbi (2018) \\"FOILcom: A fast and robust program for solving two dimensional subsonic (subcritical) inviscid steady compressible flows over isolated airfoils\\", Farzad Mohebbi (2019) \\"On the Kutta Condition in Compressible Flow over Isolated Airfoils\\", Fluids . The viscous correction for the Kutta condition can be found in some of the recent studies. C. Xu (1998) \\"Kutta condition for sharp edge flows\\", Mechanics Research Communications  The Kutta condition in aerodynamics  The Kutta condition allows an aerodynamicist to incorporate a significant effect of viscosity while neglecting viscous effects in the underlying conservation of momentum equation. It is important in the practical calculation of lift on a wing. The equations of conservation of mass and conservation of momentum applied to an inviscid fluid flow, such as a potential flow, around a solid body result in an infinite number of valid solutions. One way to choose the correct solution would be to apply the viscous equations, in the form of the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. However, these normally do not result in a closed-form solution. The Kutta condition is an alternative method of incorporating some aspects of viscous effects, while neglecting others, such as skin friction and some other boundary layer effects. The condition can be expressed in a number of ways. One is that there cannot be an infinite change in velocity at the trailing edge. Although an inviscid fluid can have abrupt changes in velocity, in reality viscosity smooths out sharp velocity changes. If the trailing edge has a non-zero angle, the flow velocity there must be zero. At a cusped trailing edge, however, the velocity can be non-zero although it must still be identical above and below the airfoil. Another formulation is that the pressure must be continuous at the trailing edge. The Kutta condition does not apply to unsteady flow. Experimental observations show that the stagnation point (one of two points on the surface of an airfoil where the flow speed is zero) begins on the top surface of an airfoil (assuming positive effective angle of attack) as flow accelerates from zero, and moves backwards as the flow accelerates. Once the initial transient effects have died out, the stagnation point is at the trailing edge as required by the Kutta condition. Mathematically, the Kutta condition enforces a specific choice among the infinite allowed values of circulation.

It was founded in 1315 CE by Shah Kamal Quhafah and his disciples. It is approximately one hour drive away from the city of Sylhet and also from Sunamganj. The village is at the heart of the Sylhet Division and nestles on the bank of the river Ratna.Achuytacharan Chowdhury Etymology The name Shaharpara derived from the title of its founder, Shah Kamal. 'Shah' means 'monarch', 'ar' (variant of 'er') means 'of' and 'para' means 'village' or 'footstep'; Shaharpara is a compound of Shah, ar and para (Shah+ar+para=Shaharpara), which is attributed to the footsteps of Shah Kamal Quhafah. Literal meaning of Shaharpara is 'footsteps of Shah', referring to the footsteps of Shah Kamal. It was when Shah Kamal Quhafah alighted himself on an island to survey the terrain for settlement and when a settlement was established, it inherited the phrase 'Shaharpara' as an honour for the settlement and ascription to Shah Kamal Quhafah.Amara Atmakatha, Qureshi, Shah A M, Sylhet 1988  Origin of Shaharpara Shaharpara is a village that nestles on the bank of river Ratna in Syedpur Shaharpara Union Parishad, Jagannathpur upazila, Sunamganj district, Sylhet Division of Bangladesh. In 1315 CE, Shah Kamal Quhafah established a settlement on a group of islands in Ratnang Sea. Nowadays, it lies on the bank of river Ratna (river Ratna is a remnant of erstwhile Ratnang Sea). The settlement of Shah Kamal Quhafah became an epicentre for spiritual occurrence, academic and esoteric learning. Gradually, it transformed into a mega village enticing a number of adjoining islets when they transmuted into hamlets: Kamalshahi, Tilak, Mirpur, Muftirchawk, Nurainpur, Lalarchar, Kurikiyar and Noagaon. From ancient to medieval periods, Jagannathpur upazila and all of its bordering upazilas were submerged in a vast sea by the name of Ratnag.Achyutacharan Chowdhury, Purbansh, Sylheter Itibritta Kamalshahi Kamalshahi (), aka Kamalshah, was founded by Shah Muazzamuddin Qureshi and it was named in honour of his father, Shah Kamal Quhafah. Kamalshahi was the capital of Muazzamabad and centre of academic and esoteric learning. At present, Kamalshahi has lost its past grandeur, but mausoleums of Shah Kamal Quhafa, his wife and children are sites for historical and archaeological interests.Syed Mujtaba Ali, Shreehatte Islam Jyoti Tilak Tilak () was a settlement established by kith and kin of ‚ÄòMoi‚Äô or ‚ÄòMai‚Äô, who was a female disciple of Shah Kamal Quhafah. Family and friends of Moi came to Shaharpara from Moi‚Äôerchar or Moiyarchar in southwest of Sylhet and they established a settlement on an islet of Shaharpara archipelago, which later came to be known as 'Tilak', as Moi's family belong to a Brahmanic denomination that required them wearing a mark on their forehead called, tilak, and the settlement later derived its name from that insignia on their forehead. At present, Tilak is considered as a hamlet of Greater Shaharpara.Nur Chowdhury Muftirchawk Muftirchawk () was an estate of Mufti Da‚Äôeem Uddin Qureshi of Mullah Barhi and it was named after his appellation of mufti. Mufti Da‚Äôeem Uddin Qureshi returned to Shaharpara on vacations and married his paternal cousin. Descendants of Mufti Da‚Äôeem Uddin Qureshi have settled in Dargah Mahalla, Sylhet. Mufti Da‚Äôeem Uddin Qureshi's eldest son, Maulana Zia Uddin Qureshi, was a philanthropist, who founded the very first school in Sylhet.Syed Mujtaba Ali Nurainpur Nurainpur () is a hamlet within the periphery of Shaharpara; it was established by Shah Nurain Uddin Qureshi and thus named after him. Shah Nurain Uddin Qureshi was a descendant of Shah Kamal Quhafah; he was a social activist, who dedicated most of his life for welfare of people and societal improvement.Chowdhury, N; Sylheter Kotha Mirpur Mirpur () hosted a garrison from the formation of Muazzamabad until it was annexed and absorbed by the Mughal Empire of Delhi. Consanguinity People of Shaharpara are related to each other; this is because most of them have descended from three sons of Shah Kamal Qu·∏•ƒÅfah and their surnames are Shah, Khwaja, Kamali or Kamaly, Qureshi, Mufti and Siddiqui after their ancestor Shah Kamal Qu·∏•ƒÅfah, who settled on the bank of river Ratna and founded a village that was named \\"Shaharpara\\" (derived from his first name). Family ties and relations with other clans are strikingly similar to that of the Arab tribes. Descendants of Shah Kamal Quhafah have extended to five families: Mullah Family, Baglar Family and Shahjee Family in Shaharpara, Qureshi Family in Patli and Mufti Family in Sylhet Dargah Mahallah. Maulana Shah Shamsuddin Qureshi, who was a descendant of Shah Kamal Quhafah, established the Qureshi Family in Patli and Maulana Shah Zia Uddin, another descendant of Shah Kamal Quhafah, established the Mufti Family in Dargah Mahallah, Sylhet. Today the Kamali population stands at approximately 5000 and most of them have immigrated to western countries for a better life, but they maintain a website that aims to bring the clan members together. History In 1303, Shah Jalal Yamani vanquished Sylhet with aid of his 360 disciples and the military might of Sultan Shamsuddin Firoz Shah. After about a decade of Muslim governance of Sylhet, an expedition of 12 Sufi disciples was sent to Sunamganj under the leadership of Shah Kamal Qu·∏•ƒÅfah, commonly known as Shah Kamal, son of Khwaja Burhanuddin Qu·∏•ƒÅfah, who was a commander and companion of Shah Jalal. The expedition suffered due a turbulent rainfall of monsoon season and thus Shah Kamal Qu·∏•ƒÅfah ended up near a village called Tilak in Jagannathpur upazillah in Sunamganj District with his disciples. It is assumed that the expedition was less adventurous because Shah Kamal Qu·∏•ƒÅfah was accompanied by his Arab wife, who was not accustomed to the local weather. Shah Kamal Qu·∏•ƒÅfah with his 12 disciples settled on the bank of river Ratna. These twelve Sufi disciples of Shah Kamal Qu·∏•ƒÅfah are as follows: 1\\\\. Pir Kallu Shah, 2. Shah Chand, 3. Dawar Bakhsh Khatib, 4. Dilwar Bakhsh Khatib, 5. Shaikh Shamsuddin Bihari, 6. Shah Faizullah, 7. Shah Jalaluddin, 8. Syed Tajuddin, 9. Syed Bahauddin, 10. Syed Ruknuddin, 11. Syed Shamsuddin and 12. Shah Manik. After Shah Kamal Qu·∏•ƒÅfah founded a settlement on the bank of river Ratna, which is nowadays known as Shaharpara, though initially it was Shahpara, he established a mosque and khanqah in Shaharpara proper. Shah Kamal Qu·∏•ƒÅfah came to Sylhet with his wife from Mecca in Saudi Arabia and she begot three sons and a daughter. Three sons of Shah Kamal Qu·∏•ƒÅfah were Shah Jalaluddin Qureshi, Shah Muazamuddin Qureshi and Shah Jamaluddin Qureshi. State of Muazzamabad (Iqlim-i-Muazzamabad) was established by Shah Muazzamuddin Qureshi. Silhat was conquered in 1384, and its north-western thana contained the mint town of Muazzamabad.Bourdillon J A, Bengal Under the Muhammadans ‚Äì Brief Notes on its geography and history. By, Indian Civil Service Calcutta, Bengal Secretariat Press 1902: 6. Around 1620 CE, Mughal annexed Muazzamabad and Sylhet; the seat of administration was transferred from Shaharpara and Sylhet to Sonargaon. Sonargaon comprised two iqlims, which is evidenced in inscriptions of Bengal: one stretching towards east and north- east, called iqlim e Muazzamabad, and the other stretching towards west and south-west keeping Dhaka in the middle, called iqlim e Mubarakabad.Stapleton Economy Greater Shaharpara has a number of markets, emporiums and bazaar where people from neighbouring villages and beyond trade. Shaharpara Bazaar is largest amongst other bazaar in the area. Education Shaharpara has a number of primary schools, one seminary by the name of Shah Kamal Madrasa and one high school by the name of Shaharpara Shah Kamal High School.

It is located approximately 10 km (6 mi) northwest of the capital Ashgabat (Ashkhabad). The old airport, with its air traffic control tower and a precision approach runway (12L-30R), opened in 1994 and was named after the country's first president, Saparmyrat Niyazov. The new airport opened in 2016 after being completely redesigned and rebuilt. History  Soviet time  The beginning of Turkmen civil aviation can be considered 1927, at that time air communications began to work between Chardzhou and Tashauz, flying through the settlements of Turtkul and Novo-Urgench (both Uzbek SSR). For this flight, aircraft were used for Junkers F.13 passengers for four people who were purchased in Germany, as well as Soviet passenger Kalinin K-4 aircraft. 8 aircraft served this airline. Later, in 1932, Soviet aircraft were purchased for the transport of passengers. Kalinin K-5 aircraft had six seats, as well as Tupolev ANT-9 aircraft, which had twelve seats. With the replenishment of the air fleet of Turkmen SSR, in 1932, an air division was formed at Chardzhou Airport that directly served the Chardzhou-Tashauz route, without transfers to other settlements.  Independent Turkmenistan  Ashgabat Airport building from 1994 to 2013 The airport terminal opened in 1994 and it had a capacity of 1,600 passengers per hour. In Soviet times, the airport was used exclusively for domestic flights. As part of Saparmurat Niyazov's aspiration to transform Turkmenistan into 'the new Kuwait', he sought to construct a distinctive airport. This zeal resulted in the control tower being constructed on the wrong side of the runway. The 'gaudy new terminal' now blocked the view of air traffic controllers as they guided pilots. The builders warned him of this, however, he responded that, \\"It looks better this way.\\"Ghost Wars, Steve Coll; pg. 303 along with the corresponding footnote on pg. 627. The building was dismantled in 2013.  New building (2016)  Interior of the new terminal Interior of the new terminal The Turkmen government opened an international tender in 2012 for the construction of a new international airport in Ashgabat, to be named \\"Oguz Han\\". Polimeks, a Turkish construction company active in Turkmenistan since the late-1990s, was declared as the winner of the tender. The new airport was opened on 17 September 2016 by the President of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow. The project costed $2.3 billion (‚Ç¨1.7 billion) and featured a highly unusual terminal design featuring a Turkmen bird. The new airport is able to serve 14 million passengers per year. It has the capacity to handle 1,600 passengers per hour. The airport has a closed- area of 350,000 m2 and includes a passenger terminal, VIP terminal, cargo terminal with a capacity to handle 200,000 tonnes of freight per year, a new air traffic control tower (ATCT), a maintenance hangar for three narrow-body aircraft, new fuelling stations, catering, fire brigade, flight simulation, repair and maintenance buildings, parking space for 3.000 cars, a civil aviation school as well as a medical center. The airport has also a new 3,800m long runway to serve wide-body, double-deck jet airliners such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8. Facilities There are two artificial runways, equipped with the second category ILS and platform, enabling them to take aircraft of all types. All services of the airport work around the clock. The airport includes passenger waiting rooms, service passport, customs, border control, a 24-hour reference service, VIP and CIP rooms, a business club, a ticket office (Turkmenistan Airlines), shops, bars, fast-food outlets, currency exchange, a new baggage handling conveyor system, international telephone, a mother and child room and the offices of the airlines (Star Alliance and Turkish Airlines). On 26 March 2014 a small passenger terminal was opened during a ceremony attended by President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow. The terminal is located on the site of a pre-existing Turkmen SSR airport (after the bus station) down the street No.2013 (Cosmonaut Blvd). For the period of construction of the main passenger terminal the temporary terminal took the service of passengers departing and arriving to Ashgabat. After commissioning of the main terminal, the terminal is used for charter flights. Airlines and destinations In Soviet times, the airport was used exclusively for servicing flights within the USSR. Currently, in addition to the aircraft of the local airline fleet, the airport serves the planes of several foreign airlines of the world, performing both passenger and cargo flights.

He began his career as a left fielder and catcher for the Cincinnati Red Stockings, and he soon moved his way around the infield. He also played for the Columbus Solons from 1889 to 1891, and in 1892, he joined the Cleveland Spiders, where he would stay until 1898, when the owners of the St. Louis Browns were buying their players from the Spiders, who ceased to exist in 1899. O'Connor moved west to play with the Perfectos until 10 games into the 1900 season, he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He played one season with the New York Highlanders before finishing his career back in St. Louis with the Browns. O'Connor is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date who have appeared in Major League games in four decades.  Scandal  Jack O'Connor in a Coca-Cola ad from 1910, as manager of the St. Louis Browns O'Connor was the player-manager of the Browns in 1910, finishing a dismal 47‚Äì107. He is best known for trying to help Nap Lajoie win the batting title and the associated 1910 Chalmers Award over Ty Cobb in the last two games of the season, a doubleheader at Sportsman's Park. Cobb was leading Lajoie .385 to .376 in the batting race going into that last day. O'Connor ordered rookie third baseman Red Corriden to station himself in shallow left field. Lajoie bunted five straight times down the third base line and made it to first easily. On his last at-bat, Lajoie reached base on a fielding error, officially giving him a hitless at-bat and lowering his average. O'Connor and coach Harry Howell tried to bribe the official scorer, a woman, to change the call to a hit, offering to buy her a new wardrobe. Cobb won the batting title by less than one percentage point over Lajoie, .385069 to .384095. The resulting outcry triggered an investigation by American League president Ban Johnson, who declared Cobb the rightful winner of the batting title (though Chalmers awarded cars to both players). At his insistence, Browns' owner Robert Hedges fired both O'Connor and Howell and released them as players; both men were informally banned from baseball for life. O'Connor accepted responsibility for the scheme, but maintained that it was the players' idea; he didn't object because the game was not a factor in the pennant race.Bio of Robert Hedges at Society for American Baseball Research To date, it is the most severe penalty handed down to a manager for in-game misconduct. It is tied for the most severe penalty overall ever handed down to a manager; Pete Rose of the Cincinnati Reds was also banned for life for betting on baseball. In 1981, however, research revealed that one game was counted twice for Cobb when he went 2-for-3. As a result, his 1910 batting statistics should have been shown as 194-for-506 and .383399, less than 0.0007 behind Lajoie at 227-for-591.

They supposedly trace their descent to the Ghorids, a dynasty originating from Mandesh in the Ghor region of modern-day central Afghanistan. The founder of the Suri Empire in India, Sher Shah Suri, belonged to the Sur tribe. They ruled the Suri Empire from 1540 until they were removed from power in 1555 after the Battle of Sirhind by Humayun and the Persian army, who re- established the Mughal Empire. Today, the Sur are part of the Pashtun tribal system, and identify with the Lodi Bettani confederacy. The Sur are also related to the Ghilji, another Bettani tribal confederacy but it is also believed that Suri is the sub-tribe of Kakar Pashtun. History Amir Suri Amir Suri was a BuddhistPage 65 from The History of India told by its own Historians H M Eliot and Dowson Volume 3 king from the ancient Ghorid dynasty in the 9th and 10th century. He was a descendant of the Ghorid king Amir Banji Baharan whose rule was legitimized by the Abbasid caliph Harun al- Rashid after a peace treaty. Amir Suri was defeated in war with the Saffarid ruler Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar. Amir Muhammad ibn Suri Muhammad ibn Suri, despite his name, was also a Buddhist king of the Ghorid dynasty from the 10th century to 1011. He fought against Mahmud of Ghazni. According to Minhaju-S Siraj, ibn Suri was defeated and captured by Mahmud of Ghazni, made prisoner along with his son Abu Ali and taken to Ghazni, where ibn Suri died by poisoning himself.The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians by Eliot and Dowson, Volume 2 page 286 Ibn Suri's son Abu Ali ibn Muhammad (reigning from 1011 to 1035) later converted to Islam, and constructed mosques and Islamic schools in Ghor.History of Civilizations of Central Asia, C.E. Bosworth, M.S. Asimov, p. 185. Conversion to Islam According to tradition, Surs are descended from the Ghori tribe. Several books by Islamic historians including Tarikh-I-Guzida of Hamdu-lla-Mustaufi, Towareekh Yumny, as well as Ferishta record that besides Muslim Surs there were also Non-Muslim Hindu and Buddhist, pagan Surs, who were attacked by Mahmud of Ghazni and converted to Islam by him. Ferishta states that the rulers of Ghor belonged to the Sur tribe, with Tarikh Yamini saying that Ghor was only converted after attacks of Mahmud while Tabaqat-i Nasiri claims they were converted even before him. Other famous Surs Another Sur king, Amir Banji Baharan, was appointed by the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid as the king of Ghor after he signed a peace treaty. The most famous Sur in history was Sher Shah Suri of Sasaram, Bihar,Moslem nationalism in India and Pakistan By Hafeez Malik, Washington DC Public Affairs Press (1963) p. 38 who ruled the Sur Empire which covered a large northern territory of the Indian subcontinent, with Delhi serving as its capital.

The route begins at an intersection with NY 28 in the town of Shandaken, just southwest of the hamlet of Phoenicia. The route runs through the narrow mountain pass called Stony Clove Notch before reaching the town of Hunter, where it ends at NY 23A. NY 214 was part of a tannery road constructed by Colonel Charles Edwards of Hunter in the late 1840s, opening by 1849. The road was upgraded in 1873 to the Stoney Clove Turnpike, which serviced hotels and resorts in the Catskills. In 1930, the route was designated as NY 214, but the part in Greene County was not state-maintained, instead by the county. From 1946 to 1956, the residents of the hamlet of Lanesville spent time fighting for NY 214 to be reconstructed due to being an unsafe dirt road for their children to attend school using their bus. After two sections were completed by 1952, the last section in Greene County was a political debate for four years over the New York State Department of Public Works delaying the project for a multitude of reasons. Construction of the final section finally commenced on July 16, 1956. In 1994, it was proposed that NY 214 become part of a scenic byway and in 2013, the state of New York approved a bill creating the Mountain Cloves Scenic Byway, which is a byway with multiple branches serving the Catskill Mountains. Route description NY 214 heading southbound from NY 23A facing Hunter Mountain NY 214 begins at an intersection with NY 28 in the town of Shandaken as the latter runs along the Esopus Creek. NY 214 gains the moniker of Main Street, climbing downhill into the hamlet of Phoenicia, crossing a tributary of Esopus Creek, Stony Clove Creek, into the center of the community. A block after the water crossing, NY 214 turns northwest off Main Street, becoming a two-lane commercial street, bypassing the downtown section of Phoenicia, now paralleling the waterway. NY 214 soon leaves Phoenicia, bending northeast along Stony Clove Creek, crossing northeast along the sides of the nearby mountains, reaching the hamlet of Chichester, where it becomes a two-lane residential road in the middle of the notch. NY 214 continues northeast out of Chichester, crossing through the town of Shandaken, remaining a two-lane roadway. A short distance northeast of Chichester, the route crosses out of Ulster County and into Greene County. NY 214 continues northeast through the town of Hunter. Reaching the hamlet of Lanesville, the route becomes a rural mountainside road through various mountains of the Catskill High Peaks. For a short distance along the route east of Lanesville, the route bends eastward rather than northeast, reaching the hamlet of Edgewood, which consists of a few homes and a junction with Notch Hill Road. At this junction, NY 214 turns northward between Plateau and Hunter mountains, becoming a two-lane woods road. NY 214 passes a small pond of Stony Clove Notch, continuing north and turning northeast near Higgins Road. After the northeastern turn, the route junctions with the southern terminus of County Route 83 (CR 83 or Ski Bowl Road). The route winds out and becomes a flat area through Hunter, reaching a junction with NY 23A in the hamlet of Hunter, just west of Tannersville. History  Construction and designation  alt=A two-lane road winding between two steep and wooded slopes. There is a small body of water on the left NY 214 dates back to a road constructed in the late 1840s by Colonel Charles Edwards, a tanner from Hunter. This road was constructed along the clove that marks eastern flank of Hunter Mountain and western of Plateau Mountain in the Catskills so that Edwards to get hemlock tree bark to the tannery from the mountains. The road constructed by Edwards and first used by Amos Connolly by 1849 for the first wagon use was upgraded in 1873 upon state approval of the Stoney Clove Turnpike, which occurred by the New York State Legislature on April 30. The road's design used has been speculated that there was a significant issue with erosion when it comes to the road through Stony Clove Notch, even into the 1940s. Stacked rock walls were commonly used to create abutments and construct banks from the streams below. In 1881, construction begun on the Stony Clove and Catskill Mountain Railway, a narrow- gauge railway from Phoenicia and the Ulster and Delaware Railroad to the village of Hunter. This new railroad was constructed to serve the Hotel Kaaterskill through the notch. The railroad was completed in 1883 and converted to standard gauge in 1899. An inn was constructed at the station in Edgewood, helping tourists and recreation through the Catskills. The railroad was shut down in April 1936 and in 1940, the tracks were torn up, though the right-of-way remains. The Notch Road was not originally included in the New York State highway map in 1912. By 1921, it had not been added. However, in 1925, with pressure from New York State Senator Arthur F. Bouton, Notch Road was added to the state highway map in 1925. The dirt road was taken over by the state of New York in the late 1920s and designated as NY 214 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.  Reconstruction debacles  = 1946-1951 = NY 214 became the subject of controversy for the conditions of the road through Lanesville and Greene County. The members of a committee of parents in Lanesville noted on December 2, 1946 that they would hold their students from going to school starting on January 6, 1947 if the state did not start work on repairing the road for safety. The committee noted that the conditions of NY 214 were dangerous, with the road's pavement not being maintained for use of the school bus and guard rails were not installed to keep cars from going into waterways. The parents remained committed and held about 55 students out of school starting January 2, stating that nothing still had been done to maintain NY 214\\\\. Burton Belknap, part of the State Education Department, stated that they intended to make sure they would work with the local parents in order to get the students back in school. The student strike was lifted on January 13 on conditions that the town of Hunter made for repairing the road. Parents noted that they demanded safer guard rails because the ones that stood were dangerous to poor construction. They also noted several sections with drops that had none whatsoever. Petitioners had sent 700 signatures to the state stating that the road had been neglected for the previous 20 years. However, by May 22, nothing still had been done despite talks, but the state claimed they needed time to get this work done. The parents pointed out a case where a driver ended up in Stony Clove Creek due to lack of guard rail. The state stated that bids on upgrading NY 214 would not go out until July and that the repairs to pavement would be within two weeks. Bids on NY 214 for the regular repairs were accepted in mid-September, with an announcement on September 17 that a bid of $281,418.74 (1947 USD) was provided by Triple Cities Construction of Binghamton to reconstruct a long section of NY 214 from Edgewood to a point north of Stony Clove. In November 1948 Greene County's Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to support getting funds for the continuation of reconstruction of NY 214\\\\. Funding for this project would come from the Federal Aid Secondary Highway Program. The Board had received letters noting that getting the road a contract should be urgent once money is located. On February 22, 1949, the county announced that the amount of $155,000 (1949 USD) was allotted for the construction on NY 214 as a continuation of funds already allotted since 1946. This would cover the rest of the road through the town of Hunter. However, the chairman of the Board, Claude Tompkins and the supervisor for Hunter, G. Richard Ham, both requested an investigation into whether or not this would be enough money to pay for the project. That August, the Lanesville Parents Committee joined other groups in forming the Greene County chapter of the New York Good Roads Association. John Papp, the chairman of the Parents Committee noted that they were focused with the chapter on urging reconstruction of NY 214 By February 1950, Papp had been elected temporary president of the new Greene County chapter. In February 1950, New York State Senator Arthur H. Wicks announced that the funds for construction of NY 214 would be put into a contract by May 1. The plans were completed and bridge designs were being finished. On May 16, the state announced that the bid would be let on the second section of NY 214. By September, things had gone backwards after an automobile with four children fell off the side of NY 214 due to the roadway caving in. This caused yet another parent strike, refusing to let their kids ride the bus on September 27. Senator Wicks called the capital in Albany to find out what the delay was in construction. The state noted that because NY 214 was not maintained by the state, but by Greene County, that it would require approval by the Federal Bureau of Roads in Washington D.C.. The state noted that they cannot do any construction until once approval on the plans was obtained. In response, Wicks arranged to get the contract let advertised on October 12 and that a bid would be accepted by November 15. Residents were continuing to hold students from taking the bus to school and that the road was falling apart in numerous areas and that people would have to drive on the shoulder regularly. However, there were no bidders on the contract, and the New York State Department of Public Works opened more bids on December 13 for the long section of NY 214 at the cost of $214,000. This second bidding process was met with success, as the John Arborio, Inc. company of Poughkeepsie for a total of $203,242.80 (1951 USD) won the bid in January 1951\\\\. The contract would include the construction of the two bridges and reconstruction of NY 214\\\\. The new roadway would be wide and paved with gravel and asphalt, replacing the dirt road that went through the notch. This contract would also eliminate curves and grades along NY 214 from Stony Clove Notch to Kaaterskill Junction and be completed by December 1, 1951. = 1952-1956 = After construction began on the section of NY 214 at its northern end, the issue came up with Greene County and its southern section of road. The state had put the project on its construction program for 1952, however, it required federal approval. The explanation was due to a request for action created by Wicks to the state superintendent of Public Works, B. D. Tallamy. Henry TenHagen, the deputy chief engineer at the state noted that the project was given to the Federal Bureau of Public Roads, who did not approve it due to restrictions on materials required for construction. The Board of Supervisors for Greene County and the town board for Hunter voted for construction the next year. The demand was raised not only due to the incident in 1950 of the car tumbling off the cliffside, but that a section of road had been washed out in a recent storm. On June 9, the federal government approved that the last section of NY 214 was eligible for federal aid, at the cost of $700,000 (1952 USD), which would be subsidized by half by the government. However, due to the approval being announced late in the fiscal year, there was no ability on part of the state to let a bid contract until the next, as all state money for the year had dried up. The $700,000 project would go to four miles of grading, drainage structures, three bridges and paving of two lanes through Greene County. The federal government announced they would approve construction bidding once the state sent documents noting they acquired rights-of-way for the project. However, by July 30, no progress was made by the state on construction despite federal approval according to J. Ernest Wharton, a United States Congressman from Richmondville. The debacle over the final section of NY 214 dragged into 1953 and soon 1954, when the residents of Lanesville pressed New York State Governor Thomas E. Dewey to take action on the stalled project. The federal appropriation of aid would expire on June 30, 1955 and the committee noted that the state had been making empty promises since February 1952. They pressured Dewey to take steps to expedite the project, as the Public Works department had been making excuses from federal aid, to engineer shortages, to lack of money, approval by Greene County and that the state must match the amount of the federal government provided. By May, the committee turned their requests to United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower for his support on the highway. Eisenhower referred the letter to the Bureau of Public Roads who noted that while the money was still there, it hinged on documents that were never sent regarding the right-of-way in 1952. On August 24, the Department of Public Works noted a letter to the parents committee noting that NY 214 had been placed on the 1955 program for construction, like it had three years prior. The state also noted that they would do survey and design during the winter of 1954-1955 and then move the project to the contract stage in 1955. By late December 1954, the district engineer for the state noted that the work would be able to be contracted by April 1. However, plans were not sent to the state until late July 1955 to the main office in Albany. To make things worse, the defeat of a $750 million road bond amendment in November 1955 would potentially delay the work on NY 214 even further. Stating more run-around by the state, John Papp, the chair of the parents committee noted that the letting proposal for a contract was to start December 1, 1955, but defeating the amendment changed plans, even though part of the road was severely damaged in a storm on October 16. By December 1955, however, the committee was fed up once again with the state and their treatment of the NY 214 reconstruction. They threatened yet another school strike after disappointed results from new Governor Averell Harriman, stating it was their only weapon left in the situation. Papp noted that a letter sent by Bellamy noted that the money was not contingent on the failed amendment. Soon after, the state canceled bids on the project, angering Wicks and New York State Assemblyman William E. Brady from Coxsackie. Angered by the decision, the parents went through with their threat to pull their children once again for a week in January 1956 until Wicks and Brady agreed to talk to the state. However, the state accused Papp in late January of confusing the issues over money for funding of the NY 214 project. The new Superintendent for the Public Works Department, John W. Johnson noted that the defeat of the amendment was the reason for canceling the bids of December 1. On April 19, a letting for the section of NY 214 was finally held, but no bids were received on the project, requiring a second set to begin on June 7. However, Governor Harriman noted that the cost of the project had gone up to $815,000 instead of the original $700,000 estimated in 1952. The bid was won by Rock Construction Company of Sunset Park on June 25 at the cost of $757,886.60, who noted that official construction began on July 16. By August, trees had been removed and the flooded out would be moved away from the creek to avoid future issues. By early September, the company noted that they were about to pour concrete for one of the new bridges and that construction was progressing at a steady rate.  Scenic byway  In March 1994, the town of Hunter, the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development and the Greene County Planning Department nominated NY 214 along with the Kaaterskill Clove portion of NYS 23A and the clove portion of Platte Clove Rd. to the New York State Scenic Roads Program. In 2011, it was proposed that the Mountain Cloves Scenic Byway would serve a section of NY 214 from State Route 23A to the Greene County line. Eventually, this would connect the Catskill Mountains Scenic Byway with the Mountain Cloves Scenic Byway, with the designation of the former in 2015. On June 20, 2013, a bill passed the New York State Assembly to designate the Mountain Cloves Scenic Byway and sent to Governor Andrew Cuomo to be signed. On July 12, the Governor signed the Mountain Cloves Scenic Byway into law. The southern section of Route 214 was designated part of the Catskill Mountains Scenic Byway in November 2015.

He served as the first Gauleiter of Pomerania and was a member of both the SA and SS.  Education  His father was German classical philologist Johannes Vahlen (1830‚Äì1911). Theodor studied in Berlin from 1889 and received his doctorate there in 1893.  Career  From 1893, Vahlen was a Privatdozent in mathematics at the K√∂nigsberg Albertina University. In 1904, he began teaching at the University of Greifswald, and in 1911 he became an ordinarius professor there. He entered military service in World War I and was an artillery battery commander. He left the service in 1917 with the rank of Major of the reserves in the 6th Royal Saxon Field Artillery Regiment 68, after having earned the Iron Cross first and second class. Vahlen in 1919 initially became a member of the German National People's Party (DNVP). In 1922 he had joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) but when it was outlawed as a result of the Beer Hall Putsch he joined the National Socialist Freedom Movement. In May 1924, under its auspices, he was elected to the Reichstag for electoral constituency 6 (Pomerania). When the ban on the Nazi Party was lifted, he rejoined (membership number 3961) and on 22 March 1925 was named the first Nazi Gauleiter of Gau Pomerania. By 1927, Adolf Hitler was replacing many early Party leaders whom he considered not to have the attributes to be effective party administrators.Dietrich Orlow: The History of the Nazi Party: 1919-1933 (University of Pittsburgh Press), 1969, p. 119,. Consequently, Vahlen was placed on indefinite leave on 1 May 1927 and his newly appointed Deputy, Walther von Corswant, was effectively put in charge. On 21 August, Vahlen was finally dismissed and Corswant officially became Gauleiter.Michael D. Miller & Andreas Schulz: Gauleiter: The Regional Leaders of the Nazi Party and Their Deputies, 1925-1945, Volume I (Herbert Albrecht - H. Wilhelm H√ºttmann), R. James Bender Publishing, 2012, p. 31, . In 1923, Vahlen was made a Rector at the University of Greifswald. On 11 August 1924, Constitution Day, Vahlen had incited a crowd at the University against the Weimar Republic, which resulted in taking down the flags of the Republic and the Free State of Prussia. The University placed him on leave for political abuse of his function, and in 1927 he was dismissed without a pension.Walker, Mark (1995) Nazi Science: Myth, Truth, and the German Atomic Bomb, pages 95‚Äì99, (Persius, 1995) Upon his dismissal, Friedrich Schmidt-Ott increased the funding Vahlen had been receiving for his work for the German Navy since 1922. Vahlen worked briefly as an assistant in Johannes Stark's private physics laboratory. In 1930 Vahlen returned to his birthplace and became a lecturer of mathematics at the Technische Hochschule Wien.Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see entry for Vahlen.Macrakis, 1993, pp. 78-79. Once Hitler became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933, Vahlen's career gained momentum and flourished in Germany as a result of his support for the NSDAP. In that year, he became an ordinarius professor of mathematics at the Humboldt University of Berlin, as successor to Richard Edler von Mises,Richard von Mises and the economist Ludwig von Mises were brothers. who emigrated from Germany as a result of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, which was in part directed against professors with Jewish ancestry, which von Mises had. After 1933, Vahlen was a strong advocate of Deutsche Mathematik, a parallel movement to Deutsche Physik, advocated by the Nobel Laureate physicists Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark; both movements were anti-Semitic. From 1934, he was ordinarius professor at the University of Berlin, a position he held until attaining emeritus status in 1937. In July 1933 Vahlen joined the Sturmabteilung (SA), and in July 1936 he switched to the Schutzstaffel (SS), with the rank of Sturmbannf√ºhrer. He received successive promotions, the last being to SS-Brigadef√ºhrer on 9 November 1943. During the period 1933 to 1937, Vahlen served as third vice president of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft. From May 1934, he was Assistant Secretary and head of the Science Office at the Reichserziehungsministerium (Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Culture.). Actually, the Science Office was split into two components, WI, a continuation of the Prussian department, and WII, the army office for research. Vahlen was head of WI, but, in actuality, the deputy chief, the chemist Franz Bach√©r ran WI.Beyerchen, 1977, p. 57. From this position, in 1936, Vahlen began publishing the journal Deutsche Mathematik, for which the Berlin mathematician Ludwig Bieberbach was the editor; in the journal, political articles preceded the scholarly articles. On 1 January 1937 Vahlen was relieved of his duties at the Ministry. Through a manipulation of the election process by Vahlen and his supporters, he was selected as president of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1938 and remained in this post until 1 April 1943.Beyerchen, 1977, pp. 144-145. In 1944-45 Vahlen worked as a lecturer at the Charles University in Prague. At the end of the war he was imprisoned in Prague and died in Czech custody in November 1945.  Mathematics  Vahlen gained his doctorate with Beitr√§ge zu einer additiven Zahlentheorie, and continued to specialise in number theory, but later turned to applied mathematics. Theodor Vahlen was an early proponent of geometric algebra. His 1902 paper in Mathematische Annalen recounts William Kingdon Clifford's construction of his 2n dimensional algebra with n ‚àí 1 anti- commuting square roots of ‚àí1\\\\. Vahlen also recounts split-biquaternions and parabolic biquaternions originated by Clifford. But Vahlen cites Eduard Study most of all since Study also focussed on the geometric motions (translation and rotation) as implicit in algebra. Since Vahlen explores some of the fractional-linear transformations of Clifford algebras, he is sometimes remembered for the Vahlen matrices. These are 2\\\\times 2 matrices with coefficients in a Clifford algebra that act on a projective line over a ring. In 1985 Lars Ahlfors recalled the article as follows: \\"The method was introduced as early as 1901 by K.T. Vahlen in a rather short, but remarkable, paper. His motivation was to unify the theory of motions in Euclidean, hyperbolic, and elliptic space, which is obviously in the spirit of Clifford. In this respect the paper seems somewhat antiquated, but the essence is in the method it advocates.\\"Lars Ahlfors (1985) \\"Mobius transformations and Clifford numbers\\", pages 65 to 73 in Differential Geometry and Complex Analysis, H.E. Rauch Memorial Volume, I. Chavel & H.M. Farkas editors, Springer books The subject of relativity was a polemical issue in Nazi Germany. As Mark Walker writes :Eventually Vahlen adopted the common tactic of ascribing the theory of relativity to other \\"Aryan\\" physicists, thereby accusing Einstein of plagiarism, but also making the theory palatable to the National Socialist state.

Biography Misha Dichter was born in Shanghai to Polish-Jewish parents who fled during WWII. He moved with his family to Los Angeles, California, at the age of two, and began studying piano at the age of five. He studied with Aube Tzerko, a pupil of Artur Schnabel, which established a concentrated practice regimen and intensive approach to musical analysis; and composition and analysis with Leonard Stein, a disciple of Arnold Schoenberg. He attended the Juilliard School in New York and studied with Rosina Lh√©vinne. While enrolled at the Juilliard School, Misha Dichter won the Silver medal at the 1966 International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, an accomplishment which helped launch his international musical career. Shortly after, he performed Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 at Tanglewood with the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erich Leinsdorf, nationally broadcast live on NBC and subsequently recorded for RCA. Dichter made his debut with Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic in 1968 performing the same concerto. Appearances with the Berlin Philharmonic, Concertgebouw of Amsterdam, the principal London orchestras, and major American orchestras soon followed. Dichter has contributed articles to leading publications including the New York Times. He has been seen frequently on national television, was the subject of an hour-long European television documentary, and was featured with his dog Thunder in the film My Dog: An Unconventional Love Story. Recordings Misha Dichter's acclaimed recordings for Philips, RCA, MusicMasters, and Koch Classics illustrate the scope of his musical interests. They include the Brahms piano concertos with Kurt Masur and the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, Brahms solo works including the Handel Variations, Beethoven piano sonatas, the complete Franz Liszt Hungarian Rhapsodies, the Liszt piano concertos with Andr√© Previn and the Pittsburgh Symphony, and Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue with Neville Marriner and the Philharmonia Orchestra, as well as music of Chopin, Mussorgsky, Schubert, Schumann, Stravinsky and Tchaikovsky. Many of Dichter's recordings have also been reissued; his recording of Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata and Brahms's Piano Concerto No. 2, Op. 83 with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra conducted by Kurt Masur, and his recording of Beethoven's \\"Moonlight\\" Sonata and Brahms's First Piano Concerto, also with Kurt Masur and the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra were released on SACD by PENTOTONE. His recording of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsodies has been reissued on the Newton label. Awards Misha Dichter was honored in 1998 with the \\"Grand Prix International Du Disque Liszt\\" for his recording of Liszt's piano transcriptions released on the Phillips label. He was inducted as a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity on April 13, 1999.Delta Omicron News Archives Cipa Glazman Dichter At Juilliard, he met his future wife, Cipa Glazman. She was born in Brazil of Polish-Russian parents and had her first piano lessons at the age of six. She made her professional debut at 16 with the Symphony Orchestra of Brazil and came to the United States to study at Juilliard shortly thereafter. Together, Misha and Cipa Dichter are an accomplished piano duo. They have performed throughout North America, Europe, and at summer festivals in the U.S. such as Ravinia, Caramoor, Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart, and the Aspen Music Festival. The Dichters have performed many previously neglected two-piano and piano-four-hand works. They recorded Mozart's complete piano works for four hands, which was released in a 3-CD set by Nimbus records. Official website of Mischa and Cipa Dichter The Dichters live in New York City.

Directed by Volker Schl√∂ndorff, the film stars Natasha Richardson (Offred), Faye Dunaway (Serena Joy), Robert Duvall (The Commander), Aidan Quinn (Nick), and Elizabeth McGovern (Moira). The screenplay was written by playwright Harold Pinter. The original music score was composed by Ryuichi Sakamoto. The film was entered into the 40th Berlin International Film Festival. It is the first filmed adaptation of the novel, succeeded by the Hulu television series which began streaming in 2016. Plot In the near future, war rages across the Republic of Gilead ‚Äîformerly the United States of America‚Äî and pollution has rendered 99% of the population sterile. Kate is a woman who attempts to emigrate to Canada with her husband and daughter. As they take a dirt road, the Gilead Border Guard orders them to turn back or they will open fire. Kate's husband uses an automatic rifle to draw the fire, telling Kate to run, but he is shot. Kate is captured, while their daughter wanders off into the back country, confused and unaccompanied. The authorities take Kate to a training facility with several other women, where she and her companions receive training to become Handmaids ‚Äîconcubines for one of the privileged but barren couples who run the country's religious fundamentalist regime. Although she resists being indoctrinated into the cult of the Handmaids, which mixes Old Testament orthodoxy with scripted group chanting and ritualized violence, Kate is soon assigned to the home of \\"the Commander\\" (Fred) and of his cold, inflexible wife, Serena Joy. There she is named \\"Offred\\" ‚Äî\\"of Fred\\". Her role as the Commander's latest concubine is emotionless. She lies between Serena Joy's legs while being raped by the Commander in the collective hope that she will bear them a child. Kate continually longs for her earlier life, but she is haunted by nightmares of her husband's death and of her daughter's disappearance. A doctor tells her that many of Gilead's male leaders are as sterile as their wives. Serena Joy desperately wants a baby, so she persuades Kate to risk the punishment for fornication ‚Äîdeath by hanging‚Äî in order to be fertilized by another man who may make her pregnant, and consequently, spare her life. In exchange for Kate agreeing to this, Serena Joy provides information to Kate that her daughter is alive, and shows as proof a recent photograph of her living in the household of another Commander. However, Kate is told she can never see her daughter. The Commander also tries to get closer to Kate, in the sense that he feels if she enjoyed herself more she would become a better handmaid. The Commander knows Kate's background as a librarian. He gets her hard-to-obtain items and allows her access to his private library. However, during a night out, the Commander has sex with Kate in an unauthorized manner. The other man selected by Serena Joy turns out to be Nick, the Commander's sympathetic chauffeur. Kate grows attached to Nick and eventually becomes pregnant with his child. Kate ultimately kills the Commander, and a police unit then arrives to take her away. She thinks that the policemen are members of the Eyes, the government's secret police. However, it turns out that they are soldiers from the resistance movement (Mayday), of which Nick is also a part. Kate then flees with them, parting from Nick in an emotional scene. Kate is now free once again and wearing non-uniform clothes, but facing an uncertain future. She is living by herself, pregnant in a trailer while receiving intelligence reports from the rebels. She wonders if she will be reunited with Nick, but expresses hope that will happen, and resolves with the rebels' help she will find her daughter.

Gale, in his book Sharp Cut, \\"the final cut of The Handmaid's Tale is less a result of Pinter's script than any of his other films. He contributed only part of the screenplay: reportedly he 'abandoned writing the screenplay from exhaustion.' ‚Ä¶ Although he tried to have his name removed from the credits because he was so displeased with the movie (in 1994 he told me that this was due to the great divergences from his script that occur in the movie), ‚Ä¶ his name remains as screenwriter\\". Gale observes further that \\"while the film was being shot, director Volker Schl√∂ndorff\\", who had replaced the original director Karel Reisz, \\"called Pinter and asked for some changes in the script\\"; however, \\"Pinter recall[ed] being very tired at the time, and he suggested that Schl√∂ndorff contact Atwood about the rewrites. He essentially gave the director and author carte blanche to accept whatever changes that she wanted to institute, for, as he reasoned, 'I didn't think an author would want to fuck up her own work.' ‚Ä¶ As it turned out, not only did Atwood make changes, but so did many others who were involved in the shoot\\". Gale points out that Pinter told his biographer Michael Billington that > It became ‚Ä¶ a hotchpotch. The whole thing fell between several shoots. I > worked with Karel Reisz on it for about a year. There are big public scenes > in the story and Karel wanted to do them with thousands of people. The film > company wouldn't sanction that so he withdrew. At which point, Volker > Schl√∂ndorff came into it as director. He wanted to work with me on the > script, but I said I was absolutely exhausted. I more or less said, 'Do what > you like. There's the script. Why not go back to the original author if you > want to fiddle about?' He did go to the original author. And then the actors > came into it. I left my name on the film because there was enough there to > warrant it‚Äîjust about. But it's not mine'.Pinter, as quoted in Harold > Pinter, 304 In an essay on Pinter's screenplay for The French Lieutenant's Woman, in The Films of Harold Pinter, Gale discusses Pinter's \\"dissatisfaction with\\" the \\"kind of alteration\\" that occurs \\"once the script is tinkered with by others\\" and \\"it becomes collaborative to the point that it is not his product any more or that such tinkering for practical purposes removes some of the artistic element\\";Gale, 73 he adds: \\"Most notably The Handmaid's Tale, which he considered so much altered that he has refused to allow the script to be published, and The Remains of the Day, which he refused to allow his name to be attached to for the same reason ‚Ä¶\\" (84n3).Cf. \\"Harold Pinter's Lolita: 'My Sin, My Soul'\\", by Christopher C. Hudgins: \\"During our 1994 interview, Pinter told [Steven H.] Gale and me that he had learned his lesson after the revisions imposed on his script for The Handmaid's Tale, which he has decided not to publish. When his script for Remains of the Day was radically revised by the James Ivory‚ÄìIsmail Merchant partnership, he refused to allow his name to be listed in the credits\\" (Gale, Films 125). =Pinter's screenplay= Christopher C. Hudgins discusses further details about why \\"Pinter elected not to publish three of his completed filmscripts, The Handmaid's Tale, The Remains of the Day and Lolita,\\" all of which Hudgins considers \\"masterful filmscripts\\" of \\"demonstrable superiority to the shooting scripts that were eventually used to make the films\\"; fortunately (\\"We can thank our various lucky stars\\"), he says, \\"these Pinter filmscripts are now available not only in private collections but also in the Pinter Archive at the British Library\\"; in this essay, which he first presented as a paper at the 10th Europe Theatre Prize symposium, Pinter: Passion, Poetry, Politics, held in Turin, Italy, in March 2006, Hudgins \\"examin[es] all three unpublished filmscripts in conjunction with one another\\" and \\"provides several interesting insights about Pinter's adaptation process\\".Hudgins, 132 =Richardson's views= In a retrospective account written after Natasha Richardson's death, for CanWest News Service, Jamie Portman cites Richardson's view of the difficulties involved with making Atwood's novel into a film script: > Richardson recognized early on the difficulties in making a film out of a > book which was \\"so much a one-woman interior monologue\\" and with the > challenge of playing a woman unable to convey her feelings to the world > about her, but who must make them evident to the audience watching the > movie. ‚Ä¶ She thought the passages of voice-over narration in the original > screenplay would solve the problem, but then Pinter changed his mind and > Richardson felt she had been cast adrift. ‚Ä¶ \\"Harold Pinter has something > specific against voice-overs,\\" she said angrily 19 years ago. \\"Speaking as a > member of an audience, I've seen voice-over and narration work very well in > films a number of times, and I think it would have been helpful had it been > there for The Handmaid's Tale. After all it's HER story.\\" Portman concludes that \\"In the end director Volker Schl√∂ndorff sided with Richardson\\"; Portman does not acknowledge Pinter's already-quoted account that he gave both Schl√∂ndorff and Atwood carte blanche to make whatever changes they wanted to his script because he was too \\"exhausted\\" from the experience to work further on it; in 1990, when she reportedly made her comments quoted by Portman, Richardson herself may not have known that.Referring to Pinter's screenplay for the film of John Fowles's novel The French Lieutenant's Woman, Gale observes: \\"Although in other films he has used a voice-over narrator, the obvious choice for retaining the Fowles touch, Pinter is on record as not being fond of the device, and he wanted to avoid it here if possible\\" (Sharp Cut 239); in relation to his screenplay for Lolita, \\"Despite the director's wanting him to use a good bit of that narrative as voice-over in the film, Pinter insist[ed] that he would never use it in a description of action ‚Ä¶ [and, Gale describes] how he put his opinion into practice\\" (358). Gale discusses the use of voice-over in or relating to other screenplays by Pinter, including those that he wrote for Accident, The Comfort of Strangers (in which Richardson also stars), The Go-Between, The Last Tycoon, The Remains of the Day and The Trial (198‚Äì99, 234, 327, 353-54, 341, 367), as well as the voice overs that he did write for his script of The Handmaid's Tale: > The novel does not include the murder of the Commander, and Kate's fate is > left completely unresolved‚Äîthe van waits in the driveway, \\"and so I step up, > into the darkness within; or else the light\\" ([Atwood, The Handmaid's Tale > (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1986)] 295). The escape to Canada and the > reappearance of the child and Nick are Pinter's inventions for the movie > version. As shot, there is a voice-over in which Kate explains (accompanied > by light symphonic music that contrasts with that of the opening scene) that > she is now safe in the mountains held by the rebels. Bolstered by occasional > messages from Nick, she awaits the birth of her baby while she dreams about > Jill, whom she feels she is going to find eventually. (Gale, Sharp Cut 318) Filming locations The scene where the hanging occurred was filmed in front of Duke Chapel on the campus of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.\\"April 18: Minutes of the Academic Council, Academic Council Archive, Duke University, 18 Apr. 1996, Web, 9 May 2009. Several scenes were filmed at Saint Mary's School in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes reports that 6 of the 19 counted critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 4.79/10 and an approval rating of 32%. Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars and wrote that he was \\"not sure exactly what the movie is saying\\" and that by \\"the end of the movie we are conscious of large themes and deep thoughts, and of good intentions drifting out of focus.\\" Owen Gleiberman, writing for Entertainment Weekly, gave the film a \\"C-\\" grade and commented that \\"visually, it's quite striking\\", but that it is \\"paranoid poppycock ‚Äî just like the book\\".

Haraiva, Avestan Haraeuua) is an Achaemenid region centered on the city of Herat in present-day western Afghanistan. In classical sources, Aria has been several times confused with the greater region of ancient Ariana, of which Aria formed a part. Geography Aria was an Old Persian satrapy, which enclosed chiefly the valley of the Hari River (Greek , this being eponymous to the whole land according to ArrianArrian, Anabasis 4.6.6) and which in antiquity was considered as particularly fertile and, above all, rich in wine. The region of Aria was separated by mountain ranges from the Paropamisadae in the east, Parthia in the west and Margiana and Hyrcania in the north, while a desert separated it from Carmania and Drangiana in the south. It is described in a very detailed manner by Ptolemy and Strabo Prolemy, 6.17; Strabo, 11.10.1 and corresponds, according to that, almost to the Herat Province of today's Afghanistan. In this sense the term is used correctly by some writers, e.g. Herodotus (3.93.3, where the Areioi are mentioned together with the Parthians, Chorasmians, and Sogdians); Diodorus (17.105.7; 18.39.6); Strabo (2.1.14; 11.10.1, cf. also 11.8.1 and 8; 15.2.8 and 9); Arrian (Anabasis 3.25.1); Pomponius Mela (1.12, where we read that ‚Äúnearest to India is Ariane, then Aria‚Äù). German cartographer Nicolaus Germanus Its original capital was Artacoana ()Arrian, Anabasis 3.25 or Articaudna () according to Ptolemy. In its vicinity, a new capital was built, either by Alexander the Great himself or by his successors, Alexandria Ariana (), modern Herat in northwest Afghanistan. Ptolemy lists several other cities, an indication of the province's wealth and fertility. The most important, according to Ptolemy and Arrian were:European Cultural Heritage Online (ECHO), Ptolemaeus, Claudius, Geografia : cio√® descrittione vniversale (universale) della terra; partita in due volumi, 1621, pages 114 & 115Encyclop√©die m√©thodique ou par ordre de mati√®res par une soci√©t√© de gens de lettres, de savants et d'artistes (1871), page 206 { border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"10\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  width=\\"20Ÿ™\\" *Dista *Nabaris *Taua *Augara *Bitaxa *Sarmagana  width=\\"20Ÿ™\\" *Siphar√™ *Rhagaura *Zamuchana *Ambrodax *Bogadia *Varpna  width=\\"20Ÿ™\\" *Godana *Phoraga *Chatrisach√™ *Chauvrina *Orthiana *Taupana  width=\\"20Ÿ™\\" *Astanda *Articaudna *Alexandria in Aria *Babarsana *Caputana *Susia  width=\\"20Ÿ™\\" *Aria civitas *Basica *Sotira *Orbetan√™ *Nisibis *Paracanac√™  width=\\"20Ÿ™\\" *Gariga *Darcama *Cotac√™ *Tribasina *Astasana *Zimyra } History The Persian Achaemenid district of Aria is mentioned in the provincial lists that are included in various royal inscriptions, for instance, in the Behistun inscription of Darius I (c. 520 BC). Representatives from the district are depicted in reliefs, e.g., at the royal Achaemenid tombs of Naqsh-e Rustam and Persepolis. They are wearing Scythian-style dress (with a tunic and trousers tucked into high boots) and a twisted turban around the head. At the time of Alexander the Great, Aria was obviously an important district. It was administered by a satrap, called Satibarzanes, who was one of the three main Persian officials in the East of the Empire, together with the satrap Bessus of Bactria and Barsaentes of Arachosia. In late 330 BC, Alexander the Great, captured the Arian capital Artacoana. The province was part of the Seleucid Empire but was captured by others on various occasions and became part of the Parthian Empire in 167 BC. Aria was sometime between the late 2nd- and early 3rd-century conquered by the Kushan Empire, who would later in ca. 230 lose the province to the Sasanian Empire, where it became known as Harev.

It was an interesting siege historically for the assemblage of great persons it saw and militarily for the cooperation of Norman and Saracen forces which it necessitated. The siege The siege was instigated by Richard II, prince of Capua, who had been exiled from his own capital for seven years (1091‚Äì1098) by Lando IV until, reaching his majority, he requested the aid of his great uncle, the count of Sicily, Roger I, and his first cousin once removed, the duke of Apulia, Roger Borsa. The two Rogers came, the former in exchange for the city of Naples and the latter for Richard's recognition of Apulian suzerainty. Roger of Sicily had lately arrested Robert, bishop of Troina and Messina, whom Pope Urban II had given the legateship of Sicily, though Roger himself was holding it. Embroiled in such controversy, the pope came down to discuss it with Roger, who released Robert. The pope's presence caused the saintly archbishop of Canterbury, a Lombard, Anselm of Aosta, then in self- exile from King William II of England, to go to meet the pope. According to Eadmer, Anselm's biographer, \\"the Lord Pope and Anselm were neighbours at the siege.\\" Eadmer also gives us an interesting portrait of the Arabs, whose brown tents Anselm found \\"innumerable.\\" According to Eadmer, many Arabs, impressed by tales of Anselm's holiness, visited his tent for food and other gifts. The biographer goes on to say that the count, whose soldiers the Saracens were, would not allow them, though many would readily have done so, to convert to the Roman Catholic faith. \\"With what policy--if one can use that word--he did this, is no concern of mine: that is between God and himself.\\" The policy, so inconceivable to Eadmer, is probably explained in this way: by maintaining a third religious and cultural party (other than Latin or Greek Christian) on the island, he assured that he could always have an ally, should either Muslim or Greek oppose him, a Latin. It also assured the presence of an \\"outlet for the military instincts and talents of his Muslim subjects,\\" according to historian John Julius Norwich. Aftermath When the city surrendered, Richard was reinstated, Roger Borsa accepted his homage, and the pope and Roger of Sicily retired to Salerno. Sources *Southern, R. W.

Lu made the Chinese national team in late 1991. However, liver illness almost prevented her from competing in the Olympic Games. In April 1992, just a few months before the Barcelona Games, she made her international debut at the World Championships in Paris, where her highly innovative uneven bars routine caught the attention of the gymnastics world. She only placed 4th because of a large step on the dismount, (although she was the leading gymnast in qualifying for the final). Lu is best known for her gold medal on the uneven bars in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. She won this with a perfect 10, which she achieved the same night as Lavinia Milo»ôovici also scored a perfect 10. Lu Li and Lavinia Milo»ôovici remain the last two people to score perfect 10s in Olympic competition to date. Lu Li also won a silver on the beam in the same games (tied with American Shannon Miller with a score of 9.912). This makes Lu Li China's second most successful female Olympic gymnast after Liu Xuan. Lu had troubles on her beam performance in the all-round competition, and placed a disappointing 34th. Lu competed in the 1993 Chinese National Games and won the uneven bars title (tied with Luo Li, who would go on to win the 1994 World Championships in Brisbane). She retired shortly thereafter. In 2000, Lu Li moved to California and was a coach there. She married Kim David Gussenhoven and has a son named J. She moved to North Carolina in 2007, still as a coach. In 2009, Lu Li moved to Stockton, California and coached at Champion Gymnastics Academy.

The film was a British-American venture produced by Ingenious Media and Zadan/Meron Productions. Adapted from both Waters's 1988 script and Thomas Meehan and Mark O'Donnell's book for the stage musical by screenwriter Leslie Dixon, the 2007 film version of Hairspray was directed and choreographed by Adam Shankman and has an ensemble cast including John Travolta, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, Amanda Bynes, James Marsden, Queen Latifah, Brittany Snow, Zac Efron, Elijah Kelley, Allison Janney, and Nikki Blonsky in her feature film debut. Set in 1962 Baltimore, Maryland, the film follows the \\"pleasantly plump\\" teenager Tracy Turnblad as she pursues stardom as a dancer on a local TV dance show and rallies against racial segregation. The film began development in 2004, and Dixon reworked Meehan and O'Donnell's first draft of the screenplay to tone down the musical's campiness. In 2005, Shankman agreed to direct the film. Composer/lyricist Marc Shaiman and lyricist Scott Wittman reworked their songs from the Broadway musical for the film's soundtrack, and also wrote four new songs for the film. Principal photography commenced in September 2006 with a budget of $75 million, and ended in December of that year; filming took place on locations in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario, Canada and on soundstages at Toronto's Showline Studios. Recording sessions for the film's songs and soundtrack took place in San Diego, California in the United States. Hairspray premiered on July 10, 2007 at the Mann Village Theater and was released on July 20, 2007 in the United Kingdom and the United States. The film was a critical and financial success, breaking the record for biggest sales at opening weekend for a movie musical, which the film held until July 2008 when it was surpassed by Mamma Mia! and later High School Musical 3: Senior Year in October.\\"High School Musical\\" breaks record . Reuters Hairspray went on to become the tenth highest grossing musical film in US cinema history, behind the film adaptations of Grease, Chicago, and Mamma Mia!, and stands as one of the most critically and commercially successful musical films of the 2000s. Available in a variety of formats, Hairsprays Region 1 home video release took place on November 20, 2007. USA Network purchased the broadcast rights to Hairspray and was scheduled to debut the film on cable television in February 2010, but in the end it did not broadcast that month. Instead the film was pushed back and premiered on USA on July 24, 2010, with sister channel Bravo also showing it multiple times, and in February 2011 aired on ABC for over-the-air broadcasts. Plot In 1962, Tracy Turnblad is a 16-year-old heavyset high school student living in Baltimore. Along with her best friend Penny Pingleton, Tracy regularly watches The Corny Collins Show, a local teen dance television show. The teenagers who dance on the show attend Tracy and Penny's high school, including Amber von Tussle and her boyfriend Link Larkin, the lead dancers. Amber's mother, Velma, manages the station WYZT, ensuring that Amber is prominently featured. Corny Collins and the dancers on the show are white, and Velma only allows African-American dancers on the show once a month on \\"Negro Day\\", hosted by R&B; disc jockey Motormouth Maybelle. One of the dancers on the show takes a leave of absence, and auditions for a replacement are held. Tracy attends, but Velma rejects her based on her weight and for supporting integration. Tracy is given detention for missing class to attend the audition, and finds the \\"Negro Day\\" kids practicing in the detention room. She befriends Seaweed, Motormouth Maybelle's son, who teaches her dance moves. Link sees Tracy dancing and encourages her to attend a record hop with the dancers from the show; she is enchanted, and dreams of a life with him. At the record hop, Tracy's moves attract Corny's attention, and he chooses her to be on the show. Tracy quickly becomes a popular performer, affecting Amber's chances of winning the show's annual Miss Teenage Hairspray pageant and her relationship with Link, as he grows fonder of Tracy. A local boutique owner named Mr. Pinky suggests that Tracy should be the spokesgirl for his store, and Tracy persuades her agoraphobic mother, Edna, to accompany her there as her agent; the outing boosts Edna‚Äôs confidence, but it is shattered when they encounter Velma and Amber, who insult both of them for their size. Tracy introduces Seaweed to Penny, and the two become smitten. Later, Seaweed and his younger sister Little Inez, a talented dancer, take Tracy, Penny and Link to a party at Maybelle's store. Edna finds Tracy there and tries taking her home, but Maybelle convinces her to stay, and tells her to take pride in herself. At the party, Maybelle informs everyone that Velma has cancelled \\"Negro Day\\", and Tracy suggests that they march for integration. Link is unwilling to jeopardize his career by marching, straining his relationship with Tracy. Edna returns to her husband Wilbur's practical joke device shop, but Velma gets there first, and tries to seduce him. After accusing Wilbur of infidelity, Edna forbids Tracy to be on the show; however, she soon reconciles with Wilbur. The next morning, Tracy sneaks out of the house to join the protest, which is halted by a police roadblock. Tracy argues with a police officer and hits him with her sign; this sparks a brawl, and Tracy runs to the Pingletons' home, where Penny helps her hide in a fallout shelter. However, Penny's mother Prudy reports Tracy to the police before tying her daughter to her bed for \\"harboring a fugitive\\". Having been bailed out by Wilbur, Seaweed and his friends help Tracy and Penny escape. Link visits Tracy's house to find her, and realizes he loves her. Seaweed and Penny also acknowledge their love during the escape. With the Miss Teenage Hairspray pageant underway, Velma assigns police officers to prevent Tracy from entering the studio. She also rigs the pageant tallies so that Amber will win. Penny arrives at the pageant with Edna, while Wilbur, Seaweed, and the Negro Day kids help Tracy infiltrate the studio. As Amber is about to be declared the winner, Tracy crashes the pageant and dances for the title; Link breaks away from Amber to dance with Tracy, and soon brings Little Inez onstage and dances with her as well. Little Inez wins the pageant after a late surge of voting, successfully integrating The Corny Collins Show. Velma tells Amber about her rigging scheme in front of a camera manned by Edna, and is instantly fired. The dancers celebrate while Tracy and Link share a kiss. Cast ;Main characters * Nikki Blonsky as Tracy Turnblad, an optimistic, overweight teenage girl who loves dancing. Tracy's racial acceptance leads her to become an active supporter for the integration of The Corny Collins Show. Hairspray was Blonsky's debut as a professional actress. * John Travolta as Edna Turnblad, Tracy's mother and a laundry business owner, who is agoraphobic and ashamed of her obesity. Travolta's casting as Edna continued the tradition of having a man in drag portray the character, going back to the original 1988 film, which featured drag queen Divine as Edna and at Hairspray's Broadway version, which featured Harvey Fierstein as Edna. Executives at New Line Cinema originally expected the part to be filled by an actor accustomed to playing comic roles, tossing around names such as Robin Williams, Steve Martin, and Tom Hanks. However, Travolta was aggressively sought after by producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron for this role because he had starred as Danny Zuko in Grease, the second most successful movie musical to date, beaten only by Mamma Mia!. * Michelle Pfeiffer as Velma Von Tussle, the racist and sizeist manager of station WYZT. Velma is invested in keeping her daughter Amber in the spotlight and The Corny Collins Show segregated. Hairspray was the first film featuring Pfeiffer to be released in five years. Stardust, also featuring Pfeiffer, was shot before Hairspray, but released three weeks afterwards. The peculiarity of Pfeiffer and Travolta appearing onscreen together (Travolta starred in Grease, Pfeiffer in Grease 2) was not lost on the production staff; Travolta requested that Pfeiffer play the part of the villainess. * Amanda Bynes as Penny Lou Pingleton, Tracy's best friend, a sheltered girl who falls in love with Seaweed despite the efforts of her stern, devoutly religious and racist mother. A young actress famous for appearances on Nickelodeon TV shows and in feature films, Bynes was one of the few movie stars cast among the teen roles. * Christopher Walken as Wilbur Turnblad, Tracy's father, the easygoing proprietor of the \\"Hardy-Har Hut\\" joke shop below the Turnblad family's apartment. John Travolta had asked that Walken be considered for the part, and he eventually beat out Billy Crystal and Jim Broadbent for the role of Wilbur. * Queen Latifah as \\"Motormouth\\" Maybelle Stubbs, a Baltimore rhythm and blues radio DJ who hosts \\"Negro Day\\" on The Corny Collins Show. Maybelle also runs a record shop on North Avenue. Queen Latifah appeared in the successful Zadan/Meron film musical Chicago, and worked under Adam Shankman's direction in Bringing Down the House. She was chosen over soul legend Aretha Franklin for the role of Maybelle. * James Marsden as Corny Collins, the host of The Corny Collins Show; his politically progressive attitudes lead him to fight his show's imposed segregation. Corny Collins is based upon Baltimore TV personality Buddy Deane, who hosted an eponymous local teen dance show in the late 1950s and early 1960s. James Marsden beat out both Joey McIntyre and X-Men co-star Hugh Jackman for the part. * Brittany Snow as Amber Von Tussle, Velma's bratty daughter and the lead female dancer on The Corny Collins Show. Amber becomes Tracy's enemy when she threatens both Amber's chances of winning the \\"Miss Teenage Hairspray\\" crown and her relationship with her boyfriend, Link. Snow previously worked with Shankman in The Pacifier. Hayden Panettiere was also considered for the part of Amber, but was decided against in part because of her then-upcoming work with the NBC television series Heroes. * Zac Efron as Link Larkin, Amber's boyfriend and the lead male dancer on The Corny Collins Show. Link is a talented (and mildly narcissistic) singer who becomes more attracted to Tracy. The character is based in part upon Elvis Presley. Efron, a popular teen actor who played Troy Bolton in the Disney Channel TV film High School Musical, was initially thought by Shankman to be \\"too Disney\\" for the role; however Shankman's sister, executive producer Jennifer Gibgot, convinced him to cast Efron, believing that the teen star would draw a substantial teen crowd. * Elijah Kelley as Seaweed J. Stubbs, Maybelle's son, a skilled dancer who teaches Tracy some dance moves and falls in love with Penny. Kelley, a relative newcomer to film, overcame other auditioners and several popular R&B; stars for the part of Seaweed. * Allison Janney as Prudence \\"Prudy\\" Pingleton, Penny's mother, a Christian fundamentalist whose strict parenting keeps Penny from experiencing social life. Her husband is serving a prison sentence for an unspecified crime. Having tied her daughter to her bed, Prudy is horrified to see that she has broken out and is kissing Seaweed on live TV. ;Minor roles * Paul Dooley as Harriman F. Spritzer, the owner of the \\"Ultra Clutch\\" company and the main sponsor of The Corny Collins Show. Although he prefers to keep The Corny Collins Show segregated, he will follow public opinion if it increases sales. * Jayne Eastwood as Miss Wimsey, Tracy's geography teacher, who gives Tracy the detention note that first leads her to Seaweed. * Jerry Stiller as Mr. Pinky, the owner of a dress shop called Mr. Pinky's Hefty Hideaway, who hires Tracy as his spokesgirl. In the original film, Stiller played Wilbur Turnblad. * Taylor Parks as Little Inez Stubbs, Maybelle's teenage daughter and Seaweed's younger sister, and a skilled dancer. Inez is based in part upon Ruby Bridges, the first black child to attend a formerly all-white school in the state of Louisiana. * George King as Mr. Flak, Amber, Link, and Tracy's history teacher. He gives Tracy detention when Amber frames Tracy of drawing a picture of him with breasts. He gives Link detention as well for coming to Tracy's defense. ;Council members * Curtis Holbrook as Brad * Hayley Podschun as Tammy * Phillip Spaeth as Fender * Cassie Silva as Brenda * Nick Baga as Sketch * Sarah Jayne Jensen as Shelley * Jesse Weafer as I.Q. * Kelly Fletcher as Lou Ann * J.P.

Neither Shankman nor Dixon could come up with a solution for filming \\"Mama\\" that did not require a three-way split screen ‚Äî something they wanted to avoid ‚Äî and both felt the number did not adequately advance the plot. As a result, \\"Mama\\" was reluctantly dropped from the film during pre-production, although it is used by Shaiman as an instrumental number when the Corny Collins kids dance the \\"Stricken Chicken\\". A special version of \\"Mama\\" was recorded for the film's end credits in May 2007, during the final score recording process, which featured vocals from each of the three women most famous for portraying Tracy Turnblad: Ricki Lake from the 1988 film, Marissa Jaret Winokur from the original Broadway cast, and Nikki Blonsky from the 2007 film. Harvey Fierstein, who portrayed Edna as part of the original Broadway cast, has a brief cameo moment in the end credits version of \\"Mama\\" as well. \\"It Takes Two\\", a solo for Link, was moved from its place in the stage musical (on Tracy's first day on The Corny Collins Show) to an earlier Corny Collins scene, although only the coda of the song is used in the final release print, and the song's background music can be heard immediately after the reprise of \\"The Nicest Kids in Town\\". \\"Cooties\\", a solo for Amber in the stage musical, is present in this film as an instrumental during the Miss Teenage Hairspray dance-off. As with \\"Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now\\", a version of \\"Cooties\\", performed in a contemporary pop rendition by Aimee Allen, is present during the end credits. The performance of a vintage dance called The Madison, present in both the 1988 film and the stage musical, was replaced for this version by a newly composed song, \\"Ladies' Choice\\". Portions of the Madison dance steps were integrated into the choreography for the musical number \\"You Can't Stop the Beat\\", and the song to which the dance is performed on Broadway can be heard during Motormouth Maybelle's platter party in the film, re-titled \\"Boink-Boink\\". \\"The Big Dollhouse\\", \\"Velma's Revenge\\" (a reprise of \\"Miss Baltimore Crabs\\"), and the reprise of \\"Good Morning Baltimore\\" were the only numbers from the musical not used in the film in any way. Shaiman and Wittman composed two new songs for the 2007 film: \\"Ladies' Choice\\", a solo for Link, and \\"Come So Far (Got So Far to Go)\\", a song performed during the end credits by Queen Latifah, Blonsky, Efron, and Kelley. Another \\"new\\" song in the 2007 film, \\"The New Girl in Town\\", had originally been composed for the Broadway musical, but was deemed unnecessary and discarded from the musical. Director Shankman decided to use the song to both underscore a rise-to-fame montage for Tracy and to showcase Maybelle's \\"Negro Day\\", which is never actually seen in either of the earlier incarnations of Hairspray.Shankman, Adam (2007). Hairspray: Soundtrack to the Motion Picture [Liner notes]. New York: New Line Records. One additional Shaiman/Wittman song, a ballad entitled \\"I Can Wait\\", was composed for the film as a solo for Tracy, meant to replace the stage musical's reprise of \\"Good Morning Baltimore\\". \\"I Can Wait\\" was shot for the film (Tracy performs the number while locked in Prudy's basement), but was eventually deleted from the final release print. The audio recording of \\"I Can Wait\\" was made available as a special bonus track for customers who pre- ordered the Hairspray soundtrack on iTunes, and the scene itself was included as a special feature on the film's DVD release. Post-production took place in Los Angeles. Composer/co-lyricist Shaiman continued work on the film's music, employing the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra to record instrumentation for both the songs and the incidental score. Production Early development Following the success of the Broadway musical of the same name, which won eight Tony Awards in 2003, New Line Cinema, who owned the rights to the 1988 John Waters film upon which the stage musical is based, became interested in adapting the stage show as a musical film. Development work began in late 2004, while a similarly film-to-Broadway-to-film project, Mel Brooks' The Producers, was in production. Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, the executive producers of the Academy Award-winning film adaptation of the Broadway musical Chicago, were hired as the producers for Hairspray, and began discussing possibly casting John Travolta and Billy Crystal (or Jim Broadbent) as Edna and Wilbur Turnblad, respectively. Thomas Meehan and Mark O'Donnell, authors of the book for the stage musical, wrote the first draft of the film's screenplay, but were replaced by Leslie Dixon, screenwriter for family comedies such as Mrs. Doubtfire and Freaky Friday. After a year's deliberation on who should direct the film, Zadan and Meron finally decided to hire Adam Shankman to both direct and choreograph Hairspray. Upon learning he had been hired, Shankman arranged a meeting with John Waters, who advised him \\"don't do what I did, don't do what the play did. You've gotta do your own thing.\\" Despite this, Shankman still noted \\"all roads of Hairspray lead back to John Waters.\\" Tory Gardner and his company Alterian, Inc. were hired to design and create the look of Edna Turnblad on John Travolta. Costume designer Rita Ryack wanted to put Edna into several revealing outfits, so Travolta ended up being encapsulated in prosthetics. He wore silicone prosthetics on his head and neck, and foam latex arms and legs that connected to a spandex and foam body suit. Adaptation changes Dixon was primarily hired to tone down much of the campiness inherent in the stage musical.Verini, Bob (July /August 2007). \\"Miss Beehive-ing: Leslie Dixon styles Hairspray for the Big Screen.\\" Script. pp. 60-66 The 2007 film's script is based primarily on the stage musical rather than the 1988 film, so several changes already made to the plot for the stage version remain in this version. These include dropping several characters from the 1988 version (such as Arvin Hodgepile (the role Mr. Spritzer fills), Velma's husband Franklin, Corny's assistant Tammy, the beatniks, et al.), removing the Tilted Acres amusement park from the story, and placing Velma in charge of the station where The Corny Collins Show is filmed. One notable difference between the stage musical, the original film, and the 2007 film version of Hairspray is that Tracy does not go to jail in the 2007 version (thus eliminating the musical's song \\"The Big Dollhouse\\"). In both previous incarnations of Hairspray, Tracy is arrested and taken to jail along with the other protesters. Edna is presented in this version as an insecure introvert, in contrast to the relatively bolder incarnations present in the 1988 film and the stage musical. Among many other elements changed or added to this version are the removal of Motormouth Maybelle's habit of speaking in rhyming jive talk and doubling the number of teens in Corny Collins' Council (from ten on Broadway to twenty in the 2007 film). Dixon restructured portions of Hairsprays book to allow several of the songs to blend more naturally into the plot, in particular \\"(You're) Timeless to Me\\" and \\"I Know Where I've Been\\". \\"(You're) Timeless to Me\\" becomes the anchor of a newly invented subplot involving Velma's attempt to break up Edna and Wilbur's marriage and keep Tracy off The Corny Collins Show as a result. The song now serves as Wilbur's apology to Edna, in addition to its original purpose in the stage musical as a tongue-in-cheek declaration of Wilbur and Edna's love for each other. Meanwhile, \\"I Know Where I've Been\\", instead of being sung by Maybelle to the kids after being let out of jail, now underscores Maybelle's march on WYZT (which takes place in the stage musical at the end of \\"Big, Blonde, and Beautiful\\"). The song \\"Big, Blonde, and Beautiful\\" was inspired by a line that Tracy delivered in the original film (\\"Now all of Baltimore will know: I'm big, blonde and beautiful!\\"), but in the stage version and in this film, Motormouth Maybelle performs the song. A reprise of the song was added to the 2007 film, which is sung by Edna and Velma. Pre-production and casting Hairspray was produced on a budget of $75 million. Casting director, David Rubin, introduced an open casting call to cast unknowns in Atlanta, New York City, and Chicago. After auditioning over eleven hundred candidates, Nikki Blonsky a high school student from Great Neck, New York was chosen for the lead role of Tracy. Nikki Blonsky auditioned for the role of Tracy Turnblad in New York City in 2006 at eighteen years old. She had no previous professional experience in acting or in singing. Blonsky had auditioned for the role because it became her dream to play the role of Tracy after seeing the musical on Broadway. Blonsky, working at Cold Stone Creamery at the time, received the news from film director, Adam Shankman, that she had received the part. Relative unknowns Elijah Kelley and Taylor Parks were chosen through similar audition contests to portray siblings Seaweed and Little Inez Stubbs, respectively. John Travolta was finally cast as Edna, with Christopher Walken ultimately assuming the role of Wilbur. Several other stars, including Queen Latifah, James Marsden, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Allison Janney were chosen for the other supporting adult roles of Motormouth Maybelle, Corny Collins, Velma Von Tussle, and Prudy Pingleton, respectively. Teen stars Amanda Bynes, and Zac Efron were cast as Tracy's friends Penny and Link, and Brittany Snow was cast as her rival, Amber Von Tussle. Jerry Stiller, who played Wilbur Turnblad in the original film, appears as plus-sized women's clothes retailer Mr. Pinky in this version. Since Hairsprays plot focuses heavily on dance, choreography became a heavy focus for Shankman, who hired four assistant choreographers, Jamal Sims, Anne Fletcher, and Zach Woodlee, and put both his acting cast and over a hundred and fifty dancers through two months of rehearsals. The cast recorded the vocal tracks for their songs as coached by Elaine Overholt in the weeks just before principal photography began in September. Principal photography Principal photography took place in Toronto, and Hamilton, Ontario, Canada from September 5 ‚Äì December 8, 2006. Hairspray is explicitly set in Baltimore, Maryland and the original 1988 film had been shot on location there, but the 2007 film was shot primarily in Toronto because the city was better equipped with the sound stages necessary to film a musical. The opening shots of the descent from the clouds and the newspaper being dropped onto the stoop are the only times that the actual city of Baltimore is shown in the film. Most of the film was shot at Toronto's Showline Studios. Most of the street scenes were shot at the intersection of Dundas Street West and Roncesvalles Avenue. A PCC streetcar with Toronto Transit Commission livery is seen in the opening sequence. Some of the signs for the 1960s-era stores remain up along the street. Toronto's Lord Lansdowne Public School was used for all of the high school exteriors and some of the interiors, while the old Queen Victoria School in Hamilton was also used for interiors. Scenes at Queen Victoria were shot from November 22 to December 2, and the school was scheduled to be demolished after film production was completed. As of the 2017-2018 school year, there are no plans to close this school. Thinner than most of the other men who have portrayed Edna, Travolta appeared onscreen in a large fat suit, and required four hours of makeup in order to appear before the cameras. His character's nimble dancing style belies her girth; Shankman based Edna's dancing style on the hippo ballerinas in the Dance of the Hours sequence in Walt Disney's 1940 animated feature, Fantasia. Although early versions of the suit created \\"a dumpy, Alfred Hitchcock version of Edna,\\" Travolta fought for the ability to give his character curves and a thick Baltimore accent. Designed by Tony Gardner, the fat suit was created using lightweight synthetic materials, consisting of layered pads and silicone, which was used from the chest upwards. The suit provided the additional benefit of covering Travolta's beard, eliminating the problem of his facial hair growing through his makeup midday. Shankman's inspirations Shankman included a number of references to films that influenced his work on Hairspray: * The film's opening shot ‚Äî a bird's eye view of Baltimore that eventually descends from the clouds to ground level ‚Äî is a combination of the opening shots of West Side Story and The Sound of Music. * Before we see a full shot of Tracy, we see individual shots of her upraised right and left arms. This is reminiscent of our first views of Sadie Thompson (Joan Crawford) in the 1932 film Rain. * Several scenes involving Tracy, such as her ride atop the garbage truck during the \\"Good Morning Baltimore\\" number and her new hairstyle during \\"Welcome to the '60s\\", are directly inspired by the Barbra Streisand musical film version of Funny Girl. * During \\"Without Love\\", Link sings to a photograph of Tracy, which comes to life and sings harmony with him. This is directly inspired from the MGM musical The Broadway Melody of 1938, in which a young Judy Garland swoons over a photo of actor Clark Gable as she sings \\"You Made Me Love You\\". * The dress that Penny wears during \\"You Can't Stop the Beat\\" is made from her bedroom curtains, which can be seen during \\"Without Love\\". This is homage to The Sound of Music, where Maria uses old curtains to make play clothes for the von Trapp children. Reception Box office Hairspray debuted in 3,121 theaters in North America on July 20, 2007, the widest debut of any modern movie musical. The film earned $27.5 million in its opening weekend at #3, behind I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. This made Hairspray the record-holder for the biggest opening weekend for a movie based on a Broadway musical. This record was later broken by the release of Mamma Mia!, which grossed $27.8 million on its opening weekend. Hairspray is currently the twelfth highest grossing musical in U.S. cinema history, surpassing The Rocky Horror Picture Show ($145 million) and Dreamgirls ($103 million), released seven months prior. Ending its domestic run on October 25, 2007, Hairspray has a total domestic gross of $118.9 million and $202.5 million worldwide. Its biggest overseas markets include the United Kingdom ($25.8 million), Australia ($14.4 million), Japan ($8 million), Italy ($4.6 million), France ($3.9 million) and Spain ($3.8 million). At the time, this made Hairspray the third musical film in history to cross $200 million internationally, behind 1978's hit Grease ($395 million) and 2002's Chicago ($307 million). It is the seventh highest-grossing PG-rated film of 2007, and has grossed more than other higher-budgeted summer releases like Ocean's Thirteen ($117 million) and Evan Almighty ($100 million). Two weeks after its original release, new \\"sing-along\\" prints of Hairspray were shipped to theaters. These prints featured the lyrics to each song printed onscreen as subtitles, encouraging audiences to interact with the film. On January 4, 2008, Hairspray was re-released in New York City and Los Angeles for one week because John Travolta was present for Q&A; and autographs. Critical reception Hairspray has garnered acclaim from film critics such as Roger Ebert, The New York Times, and The Boston Globe, as well as a smaller number of reviews comparing it unfavorably to the Waters original. The film is one of the top picks on Metacritic, with an average of 81 from 37 critics. It scored a 91% \\"Certified Fresh\\" approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 220 reviews, also indicating excellent reviews, making it one of 2007's best- reviewed films. The site's consensus states: \\"Hairspray is an energetic, wholly entertaining musical romp; a fun Summer movie with plenty of heart. Its contagious songs will make you want to get up and start dancing\\". Peter Rainer of The Christian Science Monitor named it the 4th best film of 2007. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post named it the ninth best film of 2007. Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, saying that there was \\"a lot of craft and slyness lurking beneath the circa-1960s goofiness,\\" also stating that \\"The point, however, is not the plot but the energy. Without somebody like Nikki Blonsky at the heart of the movie, it might fall flat, but everybody works at her level of happiness...\\" Ebert also noted that this film is \\"a little more innocent than Waters would have made it...\\" Krishna Shenoi, of the Shenoi Chronicle, called the movie \\"Shankman's masterpiece,\\" saying that it moved away from his previous works into a different direction, making a light comedy that deals with serious issues maturely. Shenoi also said that the film was everything he wanted Grease to be. Lou Lumenick of The New York Post hailed Hairspray as \\"The best and most entertaining movie adaptation of a stage musical so far this century ‚Äî and yes, I‚Äôm including the Oscar-winning Chicago,\\" calling it \\"one of the best-cast movies in recent memory...\\" New York Daily News critic Jack Matthews called the film \\"A great big sloppy kiss of entertainment for audiences weary of explosions, CGI effects and sequels, sequels, sequels.\\" The Baltimore Sun review offered Michael Sragow's opinion that \\"in its entirety, Hairspray has the funny tilt that only a director- choreographer like Shankman can give to a movie,\\" pointing out that Shankman skillfully \\"puts a new-millennial zing behind exact re-creations of delirious period dances like the Mashed Potato.\\" Dana Stevens from Slate called Hairspray \\"intermittently tasty, if a little too frantically eager to please.\\" Stevens noted that \\"Despite its wholesomeness, this version stays remarkably true to the spirit of the original, with one size-60 exception: John Travolta as Edna Turnblad,\\" saying \\"How you feel about Hairspray will depend entirely on your reaction to this performance...\\" The New Yorkers David Denby felt the new version of Hairspray was \\"perfectly pleasant,\\" but compared unfavorably to the Broadway musical, since \\"[director Adam Shankman and screenwriter Leslie Dixon] have removed the traces of camp humor and Broadway blue that gave the stage show its happily knowing flavor.\\" Denby criticized the dance numbers, calling them \\"unimaginatively shot,\\" and he considered \\"the idea of substituting John Travolta for Harvey Fierstein as Tracy‚Äôs hefty mother... a blandly earnest betrayal.\\" Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com found Hairspray \\"reasonably entertaining. But do we really need to be entertained reasonably? Waters' original was a crazy sprawl that made perfect sense; this Hairspray toils needlessly to make sense of that craziness, and something gets lost in the translation.\\" Zacharek was also displeased with the way Latifah's performance of \\"I Know Where I've Been\\" was incorporated into the movie, saying \\"The filmmakers may believe they're adding an extra layer of seriousness to the material... [but] the inclusion of this big production number only suggests that the filmmakers fear the audience won't get the movie's message unless it's spelled out for them.\\" Washington Blade boycott controversy Despite its critical and commercial success, Hairspray nonetheless garnered some criticism upon its release by individuals in the gay community. Much of this criticism surrounded Travolta's portrayal of Edna Turnblad, a role played in the original film by celebrated drag performer Divine, and in the stage adaptation by Harvey Fierstein. Kevin Naff, a managing editor for Washington, D.C./Baltimore area gay newspaper the Washington Blade called for a boycott of the new Hairspray film, alleging that Scientology, in which Travolta believes, was patently homophobic, and allegedly supported workshops designed to \\"cure\\" homosexuals. Adam Shankman protested Naff's proposed boycott, stating that Travolta was not homophobic, as he (Shankman), Waters, Shaiman, Wittman, and several other members of the creative staff were homosexual, and Travolta got along well with the entire crew. \\"John's personal beliefs did not walk onto my set,\\" said Shankman. \\"I never heard the word 'Scientology.'\\" Home media Hairspray was released in standard DVD and HD Blu-ray Disc formats in Region 1 on November 20, 2007. The Blu-ray disc is encoded with 7.1 channel DTS-HD Master Audio. The standard DVD was released in two versions: a one-disc release and a two-disc \\"Shake and Shimmy\\" edition. Bonus features on the two-disc release include two audio commentaries, a feature-length production documentary, featurettes on the earlier versions of Hairspray, dance instruction featurettes, deleted scenes including Tracy's deleted song \\"I Can Wait\\", a slightly extended ending, and an alternate version of the \\"Big, Blonde and Beautiful\\" reprise, and behind- the-scenes looks at the production of each of the film's dance numbers. The Blu-ray release, a two-disc release, includes all of the features from the two-disc DVD, and includes a picture-in-picture behind-the-scenes feature, which runs concurrently with the film. An HD DVD version of the film was originally slated for release in 2008, but was canceled due to New Line Cinema's announcement that it would go Blu-ray exclusive with immediate effect, thus dropping HD DVD support.

Waters reunited with director/choreographer Adam Shankman for the project, and songwriters Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman were set to compose the film's musical numbers. The story would have looked at Tracy's entering the late 1960s era of music and the British Invasion, and used the Hippie movement and Vietnam War as backdrops. While no official casting was announced, New Line said that they hoped to \\"snag much of the original Hairspray cast.\\" John Travolta, however, publicly announced that he would not return because he is \\"not a big sequel guy\\". The sequel was set for a mid-July 2010 release by Warner Bros., which owns New Line Cinema.

That same year, Blanding was hired as a physical education instructor by the University of Kentucky, where she simultaneously began her undergraduate work in the A.B. program. While at UK she coached the women's basketball team from 1919 through 1922, leading the team to a 3-14-1 record. She played on the team as team captain in 1923 under coach A.B. \\"Happy\\" Chandler. Upon graduation in 1923, Blanding was appointed the university's acting dean of women, becoming the youngest dean in the country, at age twenty-four. Blanding obtained her master's degree in political science at Columbia University in 1926, and pursued graduate studies at the London School of Economics under Harold Laski. In 1929, she was appointed dean of women and professor of political science at the University of Kentucky. She served in these positions until 1941, when she was selected as the first dean of Cornell University's College of Home Economics and became the first female dean at Cornell. Blanding was named president of Vassar College in 1946. One member of the Board of Trustees explained that they selected her because she impressed them as a \\"great personality\\". Indeed, Blanding was always known for her outspoken character; at Cornell she was praised for being an effectively aggressive administrator. Blanding herself credited her independent and charged personality to her upbringing on a farm and to the running of her own tobacco farm in Kentucky for many years. During her tenure at Vassar, Blanding instituted several important changes. In 1949, she helped establish the Mary Conover Mellon Foundation for the Advancement of Education, a research program that studied and promoted the psychological welfare of college students. An evaluation of Vassar was conducted under Blanding's leadership in the form of a two-year assessment, which reviewed everything from living conditions to academic objectives. A new curriculum that emphasized independent study was put into place as a result. Blanding encouraged the advancement of faculty members at Vassar on a merit system, not years served, and increased faculty salaries by 116%. She also instituted the house fellow system, where faculties lived in dormitories alongside students. Blanding raised $25 million for Vassar in nine years, tripling its endowment. Three new buildings (Ferry House, Chicago Hall, and Noyes House) were erected, and three major reconstructions of older buildings occurred during her presidency. She died on March 3, 1985. Other work Sarah Blanding served on many boards and commissions, often as the only woman. Her positions: consultant to the U.S. Secretary of War as member of the Joint Army and Navy Committee on Welfare and Recreation (1943-1946); member of the President's Commission on Higher Education under President Truman; and member of the Public Advisory Board of the Economic Cooperation Administration. Blanding had a prominent public presence. In the 1950s, she spoke out to protect the rights of several faculty members against allegations made by Senator Joseph McCarthy. Blanding received international attention on another occasion. Many students found an impromptu speech at a required convocation in 1964, reproaching premarital sex, alcohol, and \\"vulgar conduct\\" among Vassar students, out of step with their own mores. She also served as the first female on the First Board of Foreign Scholarships administering Fulbright Scholarships, and the National Committee that chose the first Marshall Scholarships. Upon her retirement as Vassar president in 1964, the college presented Blanding with a tractor \\"evoking both the practical effects of her tenure and her Kentucky childhood\\". Blanding died in 1985. She had been a lifelong advocate of academic freedom and independent thinking for her students. \\"I like people,\\" Blanding once said. \\"I like all kinds of people. I get along well with them because I trust them. I make it plain to everyone on my staff that I want them to stand up and fight for their own ideas. If they have better arguments, they win.\\" Legacy Blanding Tower as well as the low-rise Blanding I, II, III and IV dormitories at the University of Kentucky are named for Sarah Blanding.

However, in late April 2015 a revival of the project was initiated; The ex-Chief Secretary of Odisha, Mr. Bijay Patnaik, was hired as the President of the Vedanta University Project to revive this project. The vision Anil Agarwal, an Indian businessman, who heads the London based Vedanta Resources corporation and Naveen Patnaik, the Chief Minister of Odisha state in eastern India, had signed a memorandum of understanding to create a world class, multidisciplinary university, Vedanta University. The university, which would be entirely a not-for-profit venture, was planned to be funded from Agarwal's personal funds Sam Pitroda, the chairman of the Knowledge Commission was the choice of the first chancellor of Vedanta University. Recent reports also suggest that at least three Nobel laureates have been contracted to join the university. In July 2009, the government of Orissa passed a landmark bill to allow the massive university to be set up and function with autonomy. The three goals of Vedanta University are in the following directions: * Education: To provide meritorious Indian students access to world class education within India. * Research: To conduct cutting edge research on globally relevant topics from an Asian-centric perspective. * Society: To produce tomorrow's leaders, and to promote economic growth in the region.

Environmental Violations  Several environmental violations were raised against the university which resulted in cases in the High court and the Supreme Court. In May 2010, Government of India asked the Anil Agarwal Foundation to stall the construction of the proposed Vedanta University at Puri to address issues related to environmental violations in the project.

University was a closed chapter for four plus years  News paper reports appeared saying that the university is a closed chapter. Revival Attempt starting 30 April 2015  A revival of the project is being tried with the hiring of the ex-Chief Secretary of Odisha, Mr. Bijay Patnaik, as the President of the Vedanta University Project. He joined this position on 30 April 2015. He told TOI that his priority would be to expedite the decision in the supreme court case. Asked about potential conflict of interest, he said that such a question does not arise as the project he has joined has nothing to do with Vedanta as a company and he personally feels that the university is a desirable project that should take shape in the interest of Odisha. In an interview with Telegraph he discusses more details on his task in reviving Vedanta University. He also gave an interview (in Odia) to OTV, a major cable channel in Odisha where he addresses many questions that has been raised by the media on this issue. Some signs of a possible revival were earlier reported in September 2014 and December 2014. However, prior to that, in the previous years (2012, 2013), Anil Agarwal in some of his interviews did talk about his continuing interest in establishing Vedanta University. See for example: The Supreme court of India on 28 November 2016 gave some positive indications that it may allow Vedanta University. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India and a member of the bench hearing this case, Justice T.S. Thakur, is quoted to have said \\"Why should anyone oppose setting up of a world class university which will give opportunity to over one lakh students? If somebody is making an investment of Rs 2,500 crore in education, why should somebody oppose it? Students will benefit. Public would benefit.\\" The Supreme Court bench seems to have suggested that the court may monitor the setting up of the university so as to make sure that the land is used for the university and not for commercial purposes. Following that, the promoter, Mr. Anil Agarwal, said to OTV in Bhubaneswar: \\"We will definitely go ahead with the plan to set up the university\\".

The town itself is located about from Stuttgart, the state capital, and from Ludwigsburg, the district capital. Schwieberdingen belongs to the Stuttgart Region and Metropolitan Region. Schwieberdingen is twinned with the French township of Vaux-le-P√©nil. Schwieberdingen was possibly founded in the 3rd century, but was first mentioned in a 1304 document. The town is characterized by its location on the route from Flanders to the Black Sea, which today forms the Bundesstra√üe 10. After the Second World War, Schwieberdingen transitioned from an agricultural base to an industrial one. The town's sports club is the TSV Schwieberdingen. Its largest division, the football club, plays in the Verbandsliga W√ºrttemberg.

The landscape around Schwieberdingen shows a great diversity of soil formations, visible in the suffixes -berg, -grund, and -tal within the municipality. The river Glems, which flows through Schwieberdingen itself, periodically floods the surrounding and . The highest point above sea level in Schwieberdingen is the Katharinenlinde at NN, and the lowest is the Gemarkungsgrenze at NN. Climate Schwieberdingen is characterized by a mild climate caused by its location in the southwest region of the Neckar basin. It is shielded by the Black Forest to the west, the Swabian Alb to the south, the Swabian-Franconian Forest to the east, and the Stromberg- Heuchelberg Nature Park to the northwest.

The has discovered two Neolithic settlements in Schwieberdingen. The first belonged to what has been called the and is date to 4300 BC to 4200 BC and includes the skeleton of a woman dated to 4000 BC. The second settlement belonged to the Michelsberg culture and is about 700 to 800 years newer than the Schwieberdinger culture. Roman and Migration periods The Roman Empire conquered the modern-day municipal area and its Celtic inhabitants in 85 BC. The Romans then built a road through the area to a ford on the Glems. This road, at first just for the Roman military, would shape Schwieberdingen's destiny as one of the few connections between the Rhine and the Danube. Emperor Hadrian in particular made great use of the road. Roman farming estates were established in the area of present-day Schwieberdingen. In the 3rd century AD, the Alemanni conquered the Imperial province of Germania Superior and possibly established the first settlement in the municipal area. The territory of Schwieberdingen, then called \\"Suidbert-ingen\\", was fully established by 500, when the Franks subdued the Alemanni. The border between Francia and the Alemanni became, with the Christianisation of the Germanic peoples, the border of the dioceses of Speyer and of Constance. The Schwieberdingen of this time period must have been a military settlement to protect the important river crossing on the Glems. Other Alemannic settlements existed in the area, most notably , which was established between 750 and 802 but abandoned in the 14th century. Middle Ages Schwieberdingen was mentioned for the first time as \\"Swiebertingen\\" in an urbarium from 1304, though the had property in the village from 1160. In 1321, the count governing Schwieberdingen sold the territory to Eberhard I, Count of W√ºrttemberg.

Campground in the park. Hartwick Pines State Park is a public recreation area covering in Crawford County near Grayling and Interstate 75 on the Lower Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. The state park contains an old-growth forest of white pines and red pines, known as the Hartwick Pines, that resembles the appearance of all Northern Michigan prior to the logging era. History The Hartwick Pines are a old-growth remnant of a pine grove that was withdrawn from logging by a local timbering firm in 1927‚Äîa time when very little old-growth pine remained in northern Michigan. One of the heirs of the firm's original owners, Karen Michelson Hartwick, donated the grove, which was then in size, and 8000 surrounding acres (32.4 km2) of cutover land to the state of Michigan as a memorial to the logging industry. Sallin Hansen Lumber Company heavily logged much of the property within Hartwick Pines State Park during the 1880s and 1890s. The Civilian Conservation Corps planted many of the park's trees in the 1930s as part of a massive restoration effort. Hence, this forest is known as \\"second growth.\\" On November 11, 1940, the Armistice Day Blizzard badly damaged the Hartwick Pines old-growth pine grove. of old trees were destroyed by windthrow from this and other storms, leaving behind the that remain. Logging museum The Hartwick Pines Logging Museum was erected by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1934‚Äì1935. It contains recreated exhibit rooms, photographs and artifacts of the lumber boom years of northern Michigan. The museum is located in two replica logging camp buildings and has outdoor exhibits of logging equipment and an enclosed steam-powered sawmill that is operated during summer events. The museum is administered by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources' Michigan History Museum. Activities and amenities The Michigan Forest Visitor Center contains an exhibit hall on the history of the forests in Michigan, an auditorium, classroom space, a bookstore operated by the non- profit Friends of Hartwick Pines, and restrooms. The visitor center has an auditorium that can seat 105 people and a nine-projector multi-image slide show. The show is approximately 14 minutes long and shares the story of logging from past until today. Programs and special events are offered throughout the year. The state park includes a campground, day-use area, and network of four-season trails for summer hiking and winter cross-country skiing. The Old Growth Forest Trail to the pine grove is a loop long. The Old Growth Forest is an even-aged stand of pines estimated to be between 350 and 375 years old. The tallest trees are between 150‚Äì160 feet tall, and have a girth of more than four feet DBH (Diameter at breast height). These eastern white pine are some of the largest trees in the eastern United States. The last remaining virgin maple and beech hardwood forest in the state is at Warren Woods State Park. There are two foot trails on the south side of M-93. The wooded Au Sable River foot trail is approximately three miles in length and takes hikers across the East Branch at two different locations. The Mertz Grade Trail winds through forest and field for approximately two miles and was named for the early logging railroad spur it shares for a portion of its distance. There are four small lakes located within the state park. Two of the lakes were originally named Bright and Star Lake. However, there were too many Star Lakes so they settled on Bright and Glory Lake. In the news Although changes in drilling technology make drilling for oil and gas possible under historically nonproductive strata in northern Michigan, including sections of state forests, the state of Michigan decided in 2014 not to auction off mineral rights under Hartwick Pines.

He was the younger brother of Arabist and colonial administrator Sir Ronald Storrs. He was educated at Radley College from 1897 to 1902, and then at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he received a BA; he won scholarships at both institutions He was a professor at Elphinstone College in Bombay in 1908, and then at Rangoon College in 1912. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1911. On 28 November 1912, he married Catherine Josephine Schiff (d. 1956 Dec. quarter, Westminster). During the First World War, he initially worked for the civil service in matters concerned with supplying Russia; he was awarded the Russian Order of St. Anne for this service. In 1916-17 he served with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in Greece with the rank of Lieutenant, then in 1917 with the Secret Intelligence Service in the Aegean. At the time, large areas of Greece were effectively under Allied military occupation, nominally controlled by the Venizelist government. Storrs was responsible for the passport control and port control of some thirty islands in the Cyclades, and in effect for all counter-espionage work in this area. He suffered the unusual indignity, in May 1917, of losing his front teeth to his own gunfire; whilst test-firing a surplus three-pounder gun they had mounted to a yacht, he ignored a warning to remove his pipe, and the recoil knocked out two teeth. He worked under Compton Mackenzie, who left a favourable portrait of him in √Ügean Memories (p. 25): ::...without [Storrs], whatever fruits our work in the Cyclades bore could never have been achieved. Virgil and Horace spoke at his summons, and he commanded all the elegance of light verse that is the Cambridge man's prerogative. ::His conscientiousness was almost excessive. Night after night he would be working on the files of his office until two or three in the morning after a hard day's work of almost incessant worrying interviews. He was a martyr to bad headaches, but I never heard him give way to more than a weary groan of expostulation when human folly or vice was seeming unendurable any longer. I can never repay Francis Storrs in this world for his personal loyalty and devoted service. In the autumn of 1917 he left Athens, and moved back to London, where he was in residence in May 1918. He died in Chelsea, of the Spanish flu, on the 10th or 11 November 1918. Sources vary; it is likely he died at some point in the night, and did not live to see the Armistice. A bell at Rochester Cathedral, where his father was Dean, was dedicated in his memory in 1921, as was a French prize at Radley College.

A minority of the Church, led by Bishop Milton Wright, contended that the proposed changes were invalid since they were not adopted by all church members and formed the Church of the United Brethren in Christ (Old Constitution). The Church of the United Brethren in Christ (New Constitution) ceased to exist when it merged with the Evangelical Church in 1946 to form the Evangelical United Brethren Church (EUB), which in turn merged in 1968 with the Methodists to form the United Methodist Church. The Church of the United Brethren in Christ (Old Constitution) is now known as the Church of the United Brethren in Christ. In the 1968 merger with the Methodists, all property deeds of the Evangelical United Brethren were ceded to the United Methodist Church. In the Northwest United States, over fifty Evangelical United Brethren churches immediately negotiated to purchase their deeds back and depart. They formed the Evangelical Church of North America (ECNA). Many of the former Evangelical United Brethren churches in Pennsylvania joined the new ECNA, even though their deeds belonged to the Methodists, prompting a ten-year dispute. Eventually, the Methodists gave the dissenting Pennsylvania churches the opportunity to purchase their deeds for token amounts. The churches did so with haste and were much relieved to have their property back and be in an organization of former EUB churches.Rev. Allen Young, Chairman, Association of Evangelical Churches At about the same time, the ECNA and Canadian Evangelical Church began talks and proposals of merging. The ECNA composed and printed a compatible draft of new By-laws for the possible merger. When the Pennsylvania churches reviewed the draft they requested wording that would guarantee local churches own their property. The ECNA conveyed it was not necessary since there was no overt statement of property ownership currently in the By-Laws. With sensitivities heightened by the recent regaining of their deeds, the churches asked for wording that would prevent future changes in the by-Laws claiming church property. When the ECNA refused, the Pennsylvania churches requested withdrawal without contest for property, which the ECNA reluctantly granted. Anticipating departure, the Pennsylvania churches formed the Association of Evangelical Churches in 1981, and stated in their first By-Law that each church shall hold full title to its property. As an added precaution, it further stated that the paragraph on owning church property could not be amended without a unanimous vote of its member churches.Rev.

They primarily live in the district of Bobonaro, East Timor, while the rest live in the East Nusa Tenggara province of Indonesia. They are close to the Tetum people. The Kemak people speak the Kemak language. Kemak people are one of the smallest of the 14 Austronesian subgroups in Timor. Most of them are adherents of traditional beliefs, while part of them profess to the Catholic faith. Territorial community is headed by a leader, divided into genera. There are three levels of conjunctions. The \\"private\\" type of group corresponds to the level of uma or house. It does not only mean housing, but its category includes the exogamous groups of older and younger brothers who share a common ancestor. The \\"collective\\" type refers to the Morobe community, which encompasses 7 villages containing mainly 3 houses, and united by a common ritual cycle. Settlement area For the most part the Kemak people live in Atabae, Cailaco, Maliana (Bobonaro District, 39,000 Kemaks) and Atsabe (Ermera District, 18,500 Kemaks), but also partly in the Cova Lima District (2,100 Kemaks) of East Timor and in Belu Regency, East Nusa Tenggara of Indonesia. According to the 2010 East Timor census, 61,969 people identify Kemak language as their mother tongue. In 1970, there were 45,084 people. History Kemak people of Atsabe A typical traditional clothing called \\"tais\\" as seen in a market in Atsabe, circa 1968-1970. Before the colonial period, Atsabe was one of the centers of Timor under the koronel bote (meaning \\"Kings\\") of Atsabe Kemak, which dominated the entire Kemak inhabited areas in East Timor until the colonial period. The Kemak areas includes the north of present-day Bobonaro, in the northern Ainaro, and in the area of Suai that were tributary to Atsabe. The small Kemak empire of Marobo had a peripheral location, which is why the Kemak people there were mixed with the neighboring Bunak people for generations. Atsabe was part of a complex alliance system through rituals, marriage and trade, though which the Tetun Dili people of Wehali with its capital, Laran were established. Laran was at the same time the spiritual center of the entire island. In addition to Tetum Dili and Kemak people, the Bunak people and Mambai people of Aileu were also part of this alliance system. Together with the east of the island, the Portuguese called this area Belu (also Belos or Behale). According to the oral traditions of the Atsabe Kemaks people, they came relatively late under the colonial Portuguese rule. One reason could have been the far-reaching dispersal of the inhabitants and the impassibility of the mountainous landscape. Only in the 19th century did the Portuguese-Angolan troops had first invaded the area. The then Kings Dom Tom√°s Pinto opposed the invaders. But Dom Tom√°s was defeated and had to go to Atambua to flee to West Timor. Portuguese sources mentioned the region of Atsabe and Liurai only in the middle of the 19th century. The Atsabe rulers were particularly prone to rebel against the colonial leaders and their presence in the island. Two of Dom Tom√°s' grandchildren, Nai Resi and Nai Sama later fought for power. While Nai Resi turned against the Portuguese colonialists, Nai Sama supported the Portuguese. Nai Sama was finally executed by his own men, while Nai Resi was captured by the Portuguese in Hatulia and executed as well. The Portuguese were first regarded as another people with their own ruler. After the resistance to them had failed, the Kemak people accepted the leaders of the Portuguese as part of their higher hierarchy that provided them with a larger army, holy men, the Catholic priests and with a larger Lulic (ritual practitioner). The flag of the Portuguese and even its flagpole were viewed as sacred objects. The colonial rulers, confirmed as administrators of Portugal, were again legitimized by handing over of the flag. The acceptance of Kemak people for the established Catholicism was closely related to their understanding of the personified holiness. This imported concept of holiness is seen as a stronger expansion of the local's existing traditional Luli. The Catholic priests were given land to build chapels and were allowed to do mission work. But the success of conversion was not much because of the friendless but rather so that one's own spiritual powers can be increased. Nai Resi's son, Dom Cipriano Gon√ßalves (Dom Siprianu) became the ruler of Atsabe in 1912 until 1943. During the Japanese occupation of Timor, he and the population of Atsabe made passive resistance. Therefore, Siprianu along with six of his relatives were taken hostage by the Japanese and later executed. Since the Portuguese education system was reserved for the ruling class, they was also able to secure the leading positions in the colonial administration. The same was true later during the Indonesian occupation, the boundaries of collaboration and apparent cooperation for the protection of its own people were obvious. The East Timorese resistance also found partial support here. The son of Siprianu and the last ruler of Atsabe, Dom Guilherme Maria Gon√ßalves became a co-founder of the pro-Indonesian party, Timorese Popular Democratic Association (APODETI) in 1974, which called for the support of East Timor to Indonesia. During the Indonesian occupation, Dom Guilherme was the Governor of Indonesian Timor Timur from 1978 to 1982. Later, he distanced himself from Indonesia and went into Portuguese exile. After the East Timorese people had spoken in a 1999 referendum for an independence from Indonesia, pro-Indonesian militias attacked family members and allies of the former koronel bote (meaning \\"rulers\\"). The reason was due to the suspect that the former ruler supported the independence movement. Other Kemak communities In the spring of 1867, the Kemak people from Lermean (today the municipality of Ermera District) under the supremacy of Maubara rose up against the Portuguese colonial masters. Governor Francisco Teixeira da Silva defeated the opposition in an unequal fight. In the decisive battle, which lasted for 48 hours, the rebels had to defend themselves against a superior fire power. 15 villages were taken and burnt down. The number of victims among the Timorese is not known, while the Portuguese counted their own losses with two dead and eight wounded. The territory of Lermeans was divided into the neighboring kingdoms. In 1868, the Portuguese sent a military force to Suco Sanirin (Sanir / Saniry) whose liurai (ruler) refused to pay taxes, and a fort in Suco Batugade was made to serve as a center for military operations. The Kemak people of Suco Sanirin were officially Balibo Subdistrict tributary under Batugade military command. Between 1894 and 1897, several empires rebelled in the west of the Portuguese colony. In the Portuguese punitive action, several Kemak empires such as Sanirin, Cotubaba and Deribate were practically wiped out. Thousands of residents fled to West Timor of the Dutch East Indies and settled there in Belu. More followed in the years between 1900 and 1912. Investigations assume at least 12,000 refugees. Religion and social structure Traditional umbrellas (saluric in Tetum language) used in Atsabe, circa 1968-1970. Like the other ethnic groups of East Timor, the Kemak people today are largely adherents of the Catholic faith. Thus, in the Atsabe Administrative Post almost all inhabitants are Catholics. It spread particularly during the Indonesian occupation of East Timor (1975-1999) as a demarcation to the majority Muslim invaders. The church offered protection, criticized the brutal behavior of the occupiers, and was a means of peaceful protest. The veneration of the Virgin Mary, especially in small towns, is particularly marked by numerous religious ceremonies in churches and grottoes. Nevertheless, the Christian rites still bear traces of the animistic, traditional religion. Components of the ancient religion are ancestral cult, reliquary worship and the concept of sacred (Kemak language: luli, Tetum language: lulik) places. One of them is Mount Dar Lau, which is the mythical place of origin of the Atsabe Kemak people. According to legend, heaven and earth were once connected at this point. Christian priests that kept animistic practices, are revered as holy men with spiritual powers (Luli). Such spiritual powers are passed on through a blessing. In doing so, these spiritual forces are not only derived from the office, but rather men who are credited with spiritual forces to join the priesthood. There are slight variations in the ceremonies between the different groups of Kemak communities, such as the Atsabe Kemak and the Marobo Kemak people. Society is characterized by a hierarchical division according to the families, the \\"houses\\". The house of the Koronel (Tetum language: Liurai), the traditional kingship, had their authority derived from their origins in their founding fathers and their luli. The latter could either be both in a person himself as well as in sacred objects. The same applies to the traditional priests (gases ubu), who claimed their position on the basis of their origin and ritual knowledge. They were the guardians of sacred history and traditions. Only the king surpasses them in holiness. He also retains the largest share of holy objects, which were handed down from their founding fathers. But the authority of the priests is limited to the rituals. However, it was possible that a person have both secular power, for example, as a village chief, and at the same time a priest. The king of Atsabe had both authorities. In addition, the king's house secured his position of power though strategical marriage policy, the exchange of women and material goods, and the formation of an army to fight in regional feuds and head hunting. The sacred houses are built together by all men who belong to a tribe line. They meet on a weekend, once a month, for eleven months. At the end of the monthly work is always a small ritual feast celebrated. The sacred houses consist of seven levels, each with four steps. Restriction to the access depends on the degree of kinship. Simple guests are allowed only in the lowest level of the house, friends at least in the second level, married relatives in the third, relatives from neighbouring villages in the fourth and partly in the fifth, those married in the village in the sixth and only the Lulik Nain (meaning \\"Lord of the Holy\\") up to the seventh level. He is the guardian of the house and the sacred objects, which are kept here. At the inauguration of the house, a buffalo is sacrificed and a great feast is celebrated. Funeral ceremonies A traditional house called laco, for meeting the families that are part of a Lulic (sacred) house and also to receive guests, circa 1968-1970. The burial ceremonies of the Kemak people (Tau tana mate) are divided into three phases, namely Huku bou, Leko- cicir lia and Koli nughu. The burial ceremonies are referred to as black rituals (Metama no). It is one of the occasions when the living ones come into contact with their ancestors, which also leads to the renewal and restructuring of the social connections between the living and the dead as well as between the alliance partners, whom are connected by marriage. The house of the \\"bride-donors\\" (ai mea) and those of the \\"bride-receptors\\" play central roles in the burial ceremonies, as in other major events. Before all members of the family have arrived, the ritual cannot be started. The blood of the sacrificial animals that the Ai mea have donated is used to brush ritual objects and the grave. In times of polygamy, the attendance of second wives and their participation (Bei-bei) is an absolute requirement. In addition, there are also the attendance of the entire sides of the family, such as those of the older and younger houses (ka'ara-aliri), which are connected by marriage and the friendly and allied ones. For the Atsabe Kemak people the first phase of burial, the Huku bou, consists of sacrifice of at least five water buffaloes and several goats and pigs. The dead person is then buried in a Christian grave. The second phase, Leko-cicir lia, is the most cost- intensive ritual of the Kemak culture. This is usually performed jointly for several deceased. Only a high status dead person, such as a Koronel, receive an independent ritual. The ritual is usually performed before the beginning of the planting season (August to September), since it is combined with the request to the ancestors for a rich harvest. According to traditional belief, the second rite have not been performed yet for the soul of the deceased and it is said to remain near his house and village (Asi naba coa pu). The later the leko-cicir lia takes place, the more shall the lonely soul long for his society, and therefore will call for the souls of the living to him. An accumulation of deaths within a house is regarded as a sign of such a case. Nevertheless, the ritual is usually carried out only years after the first phase, since the house of the dead must first afford the economic means for such expensive ritual. It is particularly complicated by the concept of the Second Burial. The bones of the deceased are excavated, cleaned and re-buried, while the soul of the dead are guided through ritual songs (Nele) of the priest to the village of the ancestors on the Tatamailau, East Timor's highest mountain. The songs can take up to 14 hours. During the ritual, water buffaloes are once again presented as animal sacrifices. The severed sexual organs of all sacrificial animals are brought deep into the sacred jungle (Ai lara hui) at the end of the ceremony and placed there before Bia Mata Ai Pun (the origin of spring and trees). The ancestors are conjured up by a song, through the sacrifices of animals, to transfer the souls of the dead to the ancestors. At the end the bones of the dead are again buried. The conclusion is now a Christian Mass, the only reference to the new faith.

Youth and education Ten Bruggencate was born in Arosa, Switzerland and went to several schools in Switzerland, in the Netherlands and in Germany. He further studied at the University of Munich and started his PhD work with Hugo von Seeliger. However, due to health problems, Seeliger had to handover the supervision of his PhD students to Hans Kienle. Ten Bruggencate graduated from the University of Munich and in 1924, together with Hans Kienle, moved to the G√∂ttingen University Observatory. Ten Bruggencate stayed as an assistant at the G√∂ttingen University until 1926, when he traveled to Java. He worked there with the Dutch astronomer Joan Vo√ªte at the Bosscha Observatory near Lembang and started a survey of Cepheid variable stars. After two years at the Bosscha Observatory, he visited the Mt. Wilson Observatory and the Harvard College Observatory In the United States. In 1929 he moved to the University of Greifswald in northern Germany, where he finished his habilitation on Cepheid variable stars in 1935. Most of this work was based on the observations carried out in Lembang. Academic career Ten Bruggencate became chief astronomer at the Potsdam Observatory in 1935. The most valuable equipment at that time at Potsdam was the solar telescope in the Einstein Tower. From that time on, the main focus of ten Bruggencate's research became the Sun. In 1941, during World War II, ten Bruggencate became the director at the G√∂ttingen University Observatory. In pursuing his interest in observing the Sun, he looked for a new solar telescope. The already existing observatory at the Hainberg, south east of G√∂ttingen, provided the best location within the surrounding area. The interest of the military in the effect of the Sun on short wave radio communication made it possible to build this observatory during the war. Military patronage and ten Bruggencate's profound knowledge of the solar telescope in Potsdam assisted construction of the new telescope. A personal antipathy between ten Bruggencate and Karl-Otto Kiepenheuer, who also worked for some time at the G√∂ttingen University Observatory, led to a division of the German solar observations. While Kiepenheuer founded the Fraunhofer Institute(not to be mixed with today's Fraunhofer Society) and coordinated several solar observatories across Europe, ten Bruggencate built his own observatory. Both groups were serviced and supported by the military to help forecast short-wave communication conditions. After the war, the observations were continued. Ten Bruggencate established a second solar observatory in Switzerland where the weather conditions were more favorable compared to the often cloudy skies over Germany. The Locarno Observatory was planned and built in the late 1950s. Ten Bruggencate was the president of the Academy of Sciences G√∂ttingen from 1958 until 1961. He also remained as director of the G√∂ttingen University Observatory until his death in 1961. The Locarno Observatory became fully operational shortly after his death. The Locarno Observatory was closed in 1984 and the equipment transferred to the Teide Observatory on Tenerife, Spain. Teide Observatory also hosts telescopes of the Kiepenheuer Institute for Solar Physics. The crater Ten Bruggencate on the Moon is named after him.

The highway extends from Main Street (U.S. Route 9 or US 9) in Tuckerton to CR 535 in Cranbury Township. Much of the two-lane route passes through isolated areas of the Pine Barrens and the eastern end of the Fort Dix entity of Joint Base McGuire‚ÄìDix‚ÄìLakehurst. In these stretches, the route has a speed limit of , one of the few two-lane roads in the state to carry a 55 mph limit. CR 539 passes through three boroughs: Tuckerton, Allentown, and Hightstown. Other than those boroughs, the route travels mainly through rural townships. Route description CR 539 southbound past CR 606 in Little Egg Harbor Township CR 539 begins at an intersection with US 9 in Tuckerton, Ocean County, heading north on two-lane undivided North Green Street. South of US 9, the road continues as CR 603. The route passes through residential areas as it becomes the border between Little Egg Harbor Township to the west and Tuckerton to the east before fully entering Little Egg Harbor Township. CR 539 heads through decreasing residential development as it heads into the densely forested Pine Barrens and intersects CR 602 prior to an interchange with the Garden State Parkway. Following this interchange, the speed limit of the road rises to , the route comes to a junction with CR 606, and passes through the rural Pine Barrens for several miles. Upon crossing into Stafford Township, the road passes through the small residential community of Warren Grove, where it intersects CR 608. From here, CR 539 passes through more forest, intersecting CR 610 before becoming Warren Grove-Whiting Road entering Barnegat Township and crossing Route 72/CR 532. CR 539 southbound in Manchester Township within the Pine Barrens After this intersection, the road continues north and passes through Lacey Township as Cedar Bridge-Whiting Road before entering Manchester Township and becoming Roosevelt City Road. The route passes near a few wooded areas of homes before running through more forest and passing housing developments and businesses in the community of Whiting. Here, CR 539 intersects CR 530 and forms a brief concurrency with that route, passing businesses as it comes to the Route 70 junction. At this point, CR 530 turns west along Route 70 and CR 539 heads northwest into more of the Pine Barrens on Whiting-New Egypt Road, becoming Pinehurst Road at the CR 14 junction. The route briefly passes through Jackson Township before entering Plumsted Township, where the road turns northwest and north through forested areas of the Fort Dix Military Reservation. After leaving the Fort Dix grounds, CR 539's speed limit drops to and enters a mix of farms and woods with a few homes and businesses, heading northwest and crossing CR 640. Following this junction, the route enters more wooded areas of residential development, passing New Egypt Speedway before crossing CR 528. The county route becomes concurrent with CR 528 Truck and passes more rural areas of homes before becoming Hornerstown Road and reaching an intersection with CR 537, where CR 528 Truck turns west onto that route. CR 539 northbound north of CR 537, a former section of Route 37 Upon crossing CR 537, CR 539 enters Upper Freehold Township in Monmouth County and intersects CR 27, at which point the road becomes Trenton-Forked River Road and heads through agricultural areas with some homes, crossing another section of CR 27. The route heads through more areas of farms, woods, and residences, where it turns west onto Davis- Allentown Road at CR 539 Alt. and runs northwest through more rural areas. CR 539 enters Allentown, where it becomes High Street and passes through residential areas before intersecting CR 524. CR 539 forms a concurrency with CR 524, with the two routes continuing northeast along Main Street to a short overlap with CR 526. The road leaves Allentown for Upper Freehold Township and enters farmland as it intersects CR 526 Spur. A short distance later, CR 524/CR 539 reaches an interchange with Interstate 195 (I-195). View north along CR 539 along Main Street in Hightstown At this point, the name of the road becomes Old York Road and it forms the border between Robbinsville Township, Mercer County to the west and Upper Freehold Township, Monmouth County to the east briefly before CR 524 splits from CR 539 by turning east along New Canton-Stone Tavern Road. CR 539 continues northeast past a mix of farms and residential subdivisions before passing through more agricultural surroundings. The road briefly turns east and runs through a wooded part of Millstone Township, Monmouth County. US 130 in Cranbury After a turn to the north, CR 539 enters East Windsor Township in Mercer County and passes farms with some homes, intersecting CR 630 before passing over the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95). Following this, the road passes through residential subdivisions before entering Hightstown. CR 539 then becomes South Main Street at this point and passes homes, with CR 571 joining the route from the east. Upon reaching the commercial downtown of Hightstown, northbound CR 539/CR 571 join Route 33 as it merges from Mercer Street onto Main Street. (Traveling southbound, CR 539/571 follow Route 33 onto Mercer Street for one block before turning east onto Ward Street and then south onto South Main Street.) CR 571 then leaves the concurrency by turning to the west on Stockton Street. After crossing the Rocky Brook, Route 33 splits from CR 539 by turning to the east on Franklin Street while CR 539 continues on North Main Street past more homes, intersecting CR 633. The road heads back into East Windsor Township and runs through farmland, passing under Route 133. The road passes near housing developments, becoming South Main Street as it crosses the Millstone River into Cranbury Township, Middlesex County, in wooded areas. CR 539 reaches an intersection with US 130 a short distance later at a modified traffic circle. Continuing north along South Main Street, CR 539 ends at a signalized intersection with CR 535 and CR 685 (Old Trenton Road). History \\"State Highway Route 37\\" stamp (partially obscured) on side of the bridge When the 500-series county routes were first designated in the 1950s, CR 539 traveled west from Hightstown to Princeton on Stockton Street, Princeton‚ÄìHightstown Road, and Washington Road, the route of present-day CR 571. It became CR 571 by 1976. More recently, the state had previously designated CR 539's northern terminus to be at the US 130 traffic circle though signage at and around the intersection showed CR 539 continuing north of the circle. CR 685 was the official designation for this portion of South Main Street. By 2019, the current terminus had been established by the state. Two special routes of CR 539 existed at the creation of the 500-series county routes. County Route 539 Spur ran from Warren Grove to Waretown. The road today is now Ocean County Route 610 from CR 539 to Route 72, and CR 532 from Route 72 to its current end at US 9 (CR 532 at the time ran on what is now CR 554). This designation was removed by 1961.Historic Aerials - 1961 Topo map of Warren Grove area County Route 539 Alternate followed what is now CR 526 from Allentown to Princeton Junction.Historic Aerials - 1956 Topo map of Princeton Junction area It was renumbered as a western extension of CR 526 by 1956. A Monmouth County- takeover of Sharon Station Road in Upper Freehold known as County Route 539 Alternate occurred in 2009. Parts of CR 539 in Ocean and Monmouth counties were planned to be a part of Route 37 which would have run from Trenton to Seaside Heights. The section of the road which was actually built as a state highway was between Hornerstown Road in Plumsted Township and Burlington Path Road (CR 27) in Upper Freehold. Though this section is no longer state- maintained, this section of CR 539 still has a wide right-of-way, wide shoulders, and an old bridge from 1940 with \\"State Highway Route 37\\" engraved on the ends. Major intersections CR 539 Alternate Southern terminus of CR 539 Alt. at CR 539 County Route 539 Alternate (CR 539 Alt.) is a Monmouth County-maintained segment of Sharon Station Road in Upper Freehold Township. The road begins at a T-intersection with CR 539 near the Cream Ridge Golf Course. It travels north through farmland over Doctors Creek before passing to the east of housing developments. At its signal-controlled intersection with CR 526 where CR 539 Alt. ends, there are light industrial facilities surrounding the junction. Sharon Station Road continues north as a township- maintained road. In 2009, Monmouth County assumed jurisdiction of the southernmost of Sharon Station Road between CR 539 and CR 526 as a part of an overall project to allow through traffic on CR 539 to bypass Allentown. Monmouth County has designated this road County Route 539A although the route became signed as CR 539 Alternate between CR 539 and CR 526. The county is also proposing taking over jurisdiction of Sharon Station Road between CR 526 and CR 524 which would bring the total mileage to .

It is the shortest dialogue in Plato's traditional corpus. It centers on a discussion between Clitophon and Socrates, with Socrates remaining mostly silent. Most scholarship until recently has been concerned with the authenticity rather than the actual meaning and contents of Clitophon. The dialogue depicts Clitophon complaining to Socrates that Socrates' speeches are merely exhortative; they create a desire for justice and virtue, but do not instruct how one becomes just or what justice is. Throughout the dialogue Clitophon seems to narrate his changes towards justice and the protreptic from seeing Socrates as a god upon a stage with hopes and beliefs in attaining justice and virtue to thoughts of doubt and disappointment and eventual defiance of Socrates. Clitophon addresses Clitophon's contempt for protreptic, or exhortative, speeches. It showcases the ignorance of Socrates and depicts, as Mark Kremer puts it, the conflict of philosophy of Socrates and Clitophon's irrationality. Clitophon outside of Clitophon Not much is known about the historical Clitophon. What is known, outside of Plato, is from his presence in Aristophanes' The Frogs and Aristotle's Constitution of the Athenians. Depicted as a student of Euripides by Aristophanes, Clitophon is mentioned in relation to Theramenes, an Athenian politician, in both works. However while these works tell of Theramenes as Clitophon's companion, Bowe mentions Frogs and Athenian Constitution as not accurate reflections of the historical Clitophon, for only Theramenes is referenced in the works and Clitophon's character cannot be decided based solely upon his associations with Theramenes. As is evident from Plato's Republic and Clitophon, Clitophon was a politician of Athens, active from 411‚Äì405 BC, who was an advocate of ancestral law and a companion of Thrasymachus. In the Republic, Clitophon speaks to defend Thrasymachus' position that justice is what is right to the ruling body. Clitophon sticks to this position even when Thrasymachus backs down (340a-340b). This is the only point in which Clitophon speaks in Republic, but it shows his stubbornness and faith in his own opinions. This reluctance to yield is seen in Clitophon as well. Summary of Clitophon Opening Socrates addresses Clitophon and confronts him on the rumor of Clitophon censuring spending time with Socrates while praising time with Thrasymachus (406a1-a4). Clitophon claims that he heard incorrectly and that while he did not praise some things of Socrates, he did praise others (406a5-a7). Socrates agrees to listen to Clitophon's side so that he might learn how to better himself by allowing himself be subject to Clitophon's criticism (407a1-a5). Clitophon's imitation of Socrates' protreptic speeches Clitophon starts off by reminding Socrates that he is amazed by what Socrates says and admires his exhortative speeches (407a6-a8). Clitophon continues by giving examples of speeches, which Socrates has given (407a8-b2). =Speech concerning wealth= Socrates states that fathers focus on increasing their wealth while not finding teachers of justice to instruct their sons on how to use their wealth justly (407b2-b6). He is concerned with the traditional education, which emphasizes music, gymnastics and writing, for disharmony stems from the spirit rather than lacking of measure in music (407c1-d2). The fathers respond saying that injustice is a choice rather than a lack of education. Socrates counters this asking why would someone voluntarily do something hateful to the gods. He asserts that if one is willfully unjust, then he would be willing to allow defeat in battle; therefore it is more apt to say that one is involuntarily unjust (407d5-d7). He ends this speech declaring that more care should be given towards this education of justice (407d8-e3). Clitophon interjects at the end of the first speech to reiterate his admiration of Socrates before continuing onto the second speech (407e3-e4). =Speech concerning knowledge of use= Socrates points out that those who exercise the body are caring only for the part that is ruled, while neglecting the soul, which is what rules (407e5-e8). He goes on to say that if someone does not know how to use a tool, such as a lyre, eyes, ears and body, then that person would not know how to use that of his neighbors (407e8-408a4). Rather than using it incorrectly, it should be left alone (407e8-e9). The same concept pertains to the soul. If one does not know how to use their soul, then they should die or submit themselves to a life of slavery and those who are experts should rule (408a5-b3). Clitophon concludes the speeches and agrees with the content of Socrates' exhortative works, for they wake people as if they were sleeping, and Clitophon has never spoken against them and never will (408c1-c4). Questioning of Socrates' companions Clitophon wishes to learn what is followed by these speeches by comparing justice, as if an art, to improve the soul as medicine improves health (408c4). He asks if the companions of Socrates are now able to pursue virtue further or if they are merely only able to exhort others (408d3-e2). He compares the care of the body and soul to the care of agriculture. One should not care only for the products of agriculture, but also pay heed to that which improves the body more permanently; therefore one should pay heed to the soul and virtue and seek a device able to secure such virtue (408e5-e10). Clitophon asks the companions what art improves the soul; they respond \\"justice\\" (409a2-a6) Clitophon is not satisfied, for with justice as an art, like medicine and carpentry, it must have two effects (409a7-b1). Medicine results in more physicians and health; carpentry results in more carpenters and buildings (409b2-b6). With one result being the perpetuation of the art, justice results in just men (409b6-b8). He then asks for the second result of justice (409b8-b4). The companions give the answers \\"the beneficial,\\" \\"the needful,\\" \\"the useful,\\" \\"the profitable\\" (409c1-c3). Clitophon finds these answers inadequate, for they are not unique to justice but are the results of all other arts as well (409c6-c7). Another answer given is \\"friendships\\" (409d4-d6) Upon elaboration, the definition of friendship is narrowed to the agreement of knowledge (409e3-e10). Again, this attribute can be given to other arts as well (410a3-a4). Finally Socrates answers that justice is to harm enemies and benefit friends, then later it seems that just men never injure anyone and do only good (410a8-b2). Clitophon's defiance and final question Clitophon is frustrated by these responses, or lack thereof, and claims that Socrates is unable to tell him how to attain virtue and justice (410b3-b6). This inability is either from Socrates' ignorance of how to go further than exhorting, or his unwillingness to share such knowledge with Clitophon (410b6-c6). He gives this reason for his association with Thrasymachus and others, searching for definitions and actions toward justice (410c6-c7). Clitophon asks Socrates one last time about the nature of the body and how to care for it (410c7-d5). If Socrates is able to tell him, then Clitophon will be able to praise Socrates whole-heartedly (410e3-e5). If not, Clitophon asserts that, while Socrates is excellent at creating a desire for virtue, he is an obstacle to those whom he has already inculcated that desire (410e5-e8). Themes Protreptic According to Slings, the use of the protreptic in Clitophon is a parody of protreptic literature, which is designed to cause a change in behavior of the listener. Whether or not Clitophon was paraphrasing, Socrates' speeches lack congruence in content with three unrelated exhortations, taking the pattern of the Platonic trichotomy of values. Clitophon employs this pattern with exhortative motifs seen in other dialogues. The beginning of the dialogue is the accusing protreptic seen in Plato's Apology at 29d9-e3. Slings' example of the accusing protreptic is, \\"you care about the pseudo-Values x, y, not about true Values p, q.\\" Clitophon's first example of Socrates' speech reflects the motifs of wealth from Plato's Euthydemus; gaining wealth has no used without knowing how to use it (280b8-d7), it is better to leave wisdom than money to your children (282a7-8, 301e1-3), not only one's children but oneself should be educated in wisdom (307c3-4). The last motif of slavery is within the second example of Socrates' speeches in which variants are seen also in Plato's Euthydemus (280e3-281e2) and Alcibiades I (117c6-e5), Xenophon's Memorabilia (4.2.25-29), Aristotle's Protrepticus (62-66). What one cannot handle should be left to others or be left alone. The use of the protreptic and protreptic motifs in Clitophon is to prove that explicit protreptic is not advantageous and instead implicit protreptic ought to be preferred. Justice As Slings mentions, justice is a secondary theme in Clitophon; justice is primarily used to show the ignorance of Clitophon. Clitophon depicts the concentric definitions of justice's results with the latter definition expanding upon the former until the definition is closer to the object in search and aporia, confusion or puzzlement, is reached. However, in Clitophon, aporia is reached prematurely before Socrates gives his definition. The first set of definitions of the result of justice are definitions borrowed from Republic I with some differences; Clitophon lacks \\"the gainful\\" and places \\"the beneficial\\" at the beginning of the list rather than the end. The second definition of \\"friendship in the cities\\" is a common concept in 4th century philosophical literature, but Slings counters that friendship cannot be given as a definition of the result of justice, for it is the parallel to justice. In Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, justice and friendship have the same subject and object; therefore they increase correspondingly (1159ab25-26, 1160a7-8). With respect to the third definition, Plato is the first to reject that to be just is to harm enemies and benefit friends. His rejection is due to Socrates' other definition that justice is benefiting everyone; however, this definition is left undeveloped. In the end, these definitions failed to fit into the criteria of an art with two results. Clitophon's ignorance Clitophon throughout the dialogue displays his own ignorance, whether intentionally or not. Most important to understanding the dialogue is his ignorance of Socrates' speeches, methodology and his own ignorance. As Moore points out, Clitophon does not understand Socrates' speeches. He paraphrases them, takes them out of context, and implies there was a much larger audience for the speeches than there actually would have been. There is a misrepresentation and misunderstanding of Socrates' definition of justice and the differing means through which Socrates and Clitophon view virtue and justice as being achieved, by speech and deed, respectively. It is possible that Socrates uses protreptic speeches because he sees being just as being the same as having a desire to be just; therefore justice is achieved through speech. Clitophon holds that deeds and actions need to bring about change and make one just. This clear misunderstanding of justice is an example of how Clitophon misunderstands Socrates' speeches, for Clitophon has already been given the answer for how to achieve justice. Through not understanding his speeches, Clitophon does not understand Socrates' methods. Clitophon tries to make the protreptic speeches of Socrates effectual while in their nature they are solely meant to encourage and cause people to have a desire for justice. Clitophon misunderstands the Socratic method of elenchus, the cross- examination statements of interlocutors. Clitophon attempts to employ elenchus when he had questioned Socrates' companions, but the portrayal of his method when relating the conversation to Socrates is too one-sided with concern only for his answers and paraphrasing that of the others. This leads Bryan to label Clitophon as a pseudo-dialogue through his use of pseudo-elenchus. Having spoken with Socrates on the topic of justice it is clear that either Clitophon was not a receiver of Socrates' elenchus or he did not realize that he had been given the answer to how to achieve justice. Due to Clitophon's desire to be told what to think, this does not make him a proper interlocutor for elenchus. The largest obstacle and most important example of Clitophon's ignorance is his ignorance of his ignorance. Slings, in his portrayals of the levels of Clitophon's character, defines Clitophon as an unabashed young man, who is defensive when provoked; this is seen in his hubristic claims to know of Socrates' speeches and methods, and his attack of Socrates. Wishing to gain the knowledge of how to attain justice for political advancement, Clitophon knows that to be told what he wants, he needs to claim aporia. However to actually experience aporia through elenchus, Clitophon needs to acknowledge ignorance and bad qualities. Clitophon remains ignorant to his bad qualities and assumes that he knows much in terms of Socrates' speeches and methodologies. This ignorance holds Clitophon back from gaining the knowledge of justice. Historical vs. literary Socrates The character of Socrates in the dialogue causes difficulty in interpreting the dialogue and Socrates' silence. The Socrates within Clitophon is not necessarily equated with the historical Socrates. Within 4th century philosophical texts of the genre logos Sokratikos, the literary character of Socrates was prominent. The double character of Socrates in Clitophon, as Slings points out, labels Clitophon as a literary work rather than a philosophical pamphlet. The reader must detach himself or herself and read Clitophon as a fictional work. Socrates is used as a symbol of the protreptic and this causes the misinterpretations of the dialogue as well as the meaning of Socrates' silence. Socrates' character in the dialogue must be realized in his capacity as a tool of protrepticism and not as an accurate portrayal of the historical Socrates. Socrates' silence One of the more puzzling aspects of the dialogue is Socrates' silence. Clitophon seems to be an attack on him and yet there is no rebuttal of Clitophon's remarks. What meaning, if anything, does his silence impart on the dialogue? Hayden Ausland indicates that his silence may be just a characteristic of the protreptic genre. This silence leaves the dialogue open- ended to elicit the reader to think what may have happened and reflect on what was just said. Another belief is that Socrates' silence is a pause in thinking, which continues into his speeches in Republic. Socrates' silence also may be due to his inability to go further to teach Clitophon. As mentioned, Clitophon is ignorant of his faults and not aware of Socrates' methods at work. Socrates may not be able to do more for him. The gap between Socrates and Clitophon is illuminated and depicts the weakness of speech to not help make Clitophon understand Socrates' teachings. As another stylistic reason, the silence is a Platonic characteristic to show what Socrates is by showing what he is not. Socrates is put in the light of Clitophon's ignorance and differences between the two are seen. Kremer notes that Clitophon is depicted as the antipoetic foil of Socrates. Orwin suggests that this silence may be indicative of a legal study, stating that Clitophon may be a counter- Apology, in which Socrates is a defendant, which would not necessitate a response from Socrates. The dialogue begins with Socrates speaking in third person when referring to himself and Clitophon, which can be equated with a legal statement. What follows would then be the defense of Clitophon. An important note is that Socrates claimed that he would reply, for he had stated that he would listen to Clitophon's complaints and try to learn from them. Along the same thought, Socrates is searching for the truth of people's perceptions of him and his teachings. A characteristic of Platonic dialogues is for Socrates to listen. In Clitophon, he is acting as the audience for Clitophon, who is taking on the role of the frank speaker. Socrates is also setting a precedent for the correct behavior when someone is speaking, something which Clitophon himself does not do well. Authenticity Only in recent scholarship have there been doubts about the authenticity of Clitophon as a work of Plato. Many ancient authors, such as Diogenes La√´rtius, who stated that it was taken straight from the hand of Plato, had cited Clitophon. In the 19th century, scholars began to label Clitophon as spurious because it did not fit their subjective interpretation of what qualifies as Platonic works. Attempts to defend the authenticity have sprung up, but among the defenses there is still much disagreement over classifying the work as fragmentary, completed and independent, or related with Republic. Spurious The rejection of Clitophon depends on both thematic and philological reasons. Heidel and others believed that the vocabulary used in Clitophon would not have been used by Plato; however, that argument has been defeated by Brunnecke, Kester and Grube. Plato's use of language is too varied and interpretations of style are too subjective to be able to use language as a base from which to deem Clitophon unauthentic. The more substantial argument is based on the anti-Socratic sentiment. It is difficult at first to answer why Socrates would be criticized by his student and follower. While it was thought that the confusion of Clitophon's authorship began with the Aldine Press editions of Plato's works, the 1491 Ficino translations say that this work was not Plato's. This indication was from Greek manuscripts, which did not clearly state the author of Clitophon. Schleiermacher was one of the first to lead people to characterize Clitophon as spurious; while he acknowledges its listing in the Platonic corpus, he could not reconcile the non-Socratic sensitivity. It seems improbable for the author to not be Plato, for he is not intending to criticize the historical Socrates, but to create an example of a person not understanding Socrates through the reproach of literary Socrates. If Clitophon is indeed spurious, then who would have written this dialogue? Slings had originally noted that due to the similarity of writing to that of Plato's, it must have been written by a student of Plato. Schleiermacher believed it to have been written by a contemporary school of rhetoric, which wrote this dialogue as an attack against Socrates. It is difficult to attribute a work so similar in style to Plato's to another person. Slings in his later work admittedly changed his thesis on the authorship and claimed that it is easier to accept as a work of Plato than to postulate an anonymous author similar to Plato's skill. Genuine work of Plato It seems more acceptable to classify Clitophon as a work of Plato. Yxem was the first to question the Aldine editions' of 1513 placement of Clitophon as a mistake. As already mentioned, there are ancient writers who have cited Clitophon and indicated no suspicions of its authenticity. Grote mentions it safer to accept this work as one of Plato rather than ascribe it to another. =Plato's attack on Antisthenes= Brunnecke, Kester and Souilhe believe this dialogue to be an attack on Antisthenes. Based upon Diogenes La√´rtius crediting Antisthenes with three books of protreptic works in his Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers vi 16, Clitophon may well be a criticism of Antisthenes. The author of Clitophon uses one of Antisthenes' protreptic works and summarizes its content. Throughout Clitophon, Plato disparages the use of protreptic speeches. This could easily be an answer to why Plato seems to be anti-Socratic; he wishes to indirectly denounce Antisthenes via Socrates. However this seems to far-fetched to connect a symbolic attack of Socrates to a real intended attack of Antisthenes. =Fragment or draft of Plato= Many think that Clitophon is a fragment or draft written by Plato. Grube believes Clitophon to have been a draft of Plato as a reflection of his dissatisfaction with his earlier methods, a tone seen in the middle period of Plato's works, but was abandoned as is attested to in its lack of revision. Bury believed that, if indeed it was written by Plato, Clitophon would be a fragmentary preface of Republic, a stance held by Shorey and Grote. However, Slings makes note that no ancient author ever indicated that Clitophon was incomplete or unfinished. In Parallel Lives, Plutarch, fully aware of Clitophon, mentions that Plato's life ended before finishing his work (32.2), namely Critias, not Clitophon; this indicates that Clitophon was finished in the opinion of ancient authors. =Finished work of Plato related to Republic= Discussed previously, Grube thought Clitophon was not necessarily a finished work, but one associated with Republic. Thrasyllus of Mendes, Tiberius' astrologer, arranged Clitophon within the Platonic corpus including Republic, Timaeus, and Critias. Grube thought it to be the criticism of Republic I and the rest of the Republic was a response to Clitophon. Annas defends this stance with her belief that the remainder of Republic, being mostly a monologue by Socrates, to be the response to the silence of Socrates. Also, with the views of justice in Republic I, Clitophon is a natural reaction to Republic I, with Clitophon seeking out Thrasymachus. With Clitophon and Socrates at odds within Republic without any explanation, Orwin indicated that Clitophon might be the missing confrontation between Socrates and Clitophon. However, there are difficulties when attempting to understand Clitophon in relation to Republic, for it is unclear where Clitophon should be placed. It is possible that Clitophon was written after Republic and Clitophon only draws definitions from Republic. But regardless of when it was written, it can still be read as an introduction to Republic, and only completed by it. =Independent completed work by Plato= Although there are clear ties to Republic thematically in terms of the discussions on justice, Clitophon has very different themes concerning philosophical methods, resulting in its classification as an independent work in its own right. Above, the identification of Clitophon as a legal study has already been mentioned with no connections to another dialogue. On the other hand, Slings labels Clitophon as a short dialogue according to M√ºller's standards. Clitophon is used on this view to criticize protrepticism, for the colleagues of Socrates were only able to gain slogans and motifs surrounding justice rather than a full understanding of it. Clitophon is also a warning of how to not read protreptical dialogues and of the dangers of relying on these dialogues to gain insight. Clitophon did not want to think for himself, but rather to be told what to think by Socrates. As a replacement to protreptic speech, Slings proposes that Clitophon champions elenchus as the mode through which to attain virtue and justice by reaching aporia.

Postan, University of South Carolina Press, 1990:79) provides a working definition of par√©age: \\"According to these agreements each party contracted to contribute a share. One provided the land and exclusive rights (bans) over it. The other contributed the influence or connections which permitted recruitment or the money with which to instal men. Profits from the undertaking, and especially the product of the exclusive monopolies (taxes banales) were then equally divided.\\" Typical monopolies would be a water mill or a communal oven.. On a familial scale, par√©age could also refer to the equal division of lands and the titles they brought between sons of an inheritance. Such a power-sharing contract could be signed between two secular rulers or, most usually, by a secular and an ecclesiastic ruler, as in the case of the most famous, the Act of par√©age of 1278 that founded a legal basis for the Principality of Andorra, signed by the Count of Foix and Viscount of Castellbo and the Bishop of Urgell. The Count and the Bishop were to receive taxes in alternate years, to appoint local representatives to administer justice jointly, and should forbear to make war within Andorra, where each might levy soldiers, nevertheless. The wording of a par√©age, an exercise in defining reciprocity without sacrificing suzerainty, was the special domain of ministerial lawyers, being produced in the universities from the late eleventh century. Contracts of par√©age were very numerous in the regions of intensely protected local rights, Languedoc and Catalonia, during the high and late Middle Ages, especially between lay and clerical interests.

It was developed in 2005 by Finnish programmer Mayoneez, also known as Mikko Oksalahti. The game uses the Mope physics engine developed by the same person. In 2015, it was announced that the game would be remastered for its tenth anniversary, by Lucky You Studio. Featuring a full overhaul and VR support, the game was Greenlit in June. Gameplay In Kumoon, you control a yellow baby chick from a third person view. Controls are fairly simple, consisting of walking around, hovering, pushing objects and shooting. The object of the game is to advance from stage to stage by making all of the red blocks in a level turn into white blocks, and to finish each of the 39 stages with a positive score. Completing a stage with a negative score causes you to lose a life and restart the stage, while losing all three lives gives you a Game Over screen, though this means very little as you can start again from the last level you attempted. The primary method of turning red blocks white blocks is by shooting them. You have 3 weapons at your disposal throughout the entire game: the shotgun, the grenade launcher, and the revolver. All of these weapons draw from the same ammo reserve, the current score. The revolver is the most basic weapon, firing a single black bullet at the cost of 100 points. The shotgun fires a spray of several small black balls, capable of hitting many more blocks, but at the cost of 500 points. The grenade launcher shoots a shell which explodes, releasing a storm of normal bullets in all directions, also at the cost of 500 points. The first shot in each level, however, is free. Another method used to turn red blocks white is to push them into the walls. Although touching a red block directly causes you to lose points, you can indirectly move them by pushing a white block into a red block and pushing both. Jostling red blocks, either by making them fall to the ground or dropping blocks onto them from a significant height, will also convert them to white blocks. Each red block you turn white earns you ten points, but you can earn additional points by ricocheting bullets off walls before they strike the block. The gains are significant, allowing you to earn up to 300 points per block converted. Every five levels, the game sends you to a bonus level. The same general strategy applies except that you are given a set number of pistol, shotgun and grenade rounds with which to earn as many points as possible. Other than that, and the fact that the blocks you must convert are now green instead of red, the bonus rounds are identical to the main game. Aside from helping you build up your score, they often introduce new skills or physics techniques that will be vital to future levels. Kumoon supports custom levels. The levels are in plaintext format and are easily modified. There is a level syntax document with the levels. A custom level 40 has been created using the syntax and made available to the public., kumoon level 40.

Prototype engines were installed in the two competing technology demonstrator aircraft, the Lockheed YF-22 and Northrop YF-23. Pratt & Whitney's competing F119 was selected over the YF120 to power the ATF, which became the F-22 Raptor. History Development General Electric (GE) began developing the F120 for the Joint Advanced Fighter Engine (JAFE) program in the early 1980s aimed at supplying the powerplant for the Air Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF). The core technology used in the F120 design was developed during two industry-government programs, the Advanced Technology Engine Gas Generator (ATEGG) and Joint Technology Demonstration Engine (JTDE) programs. These and other programs were subsequently combined into the Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology (IHPTET) program.Norris, Guy (1990). Power Struggle.

This decision was made as a result of the challenging ATF requirement of supercruise. This meant the engine had to produce a large amount of dry thrust (without afterburner) and therefore have high off-design efficiency (\\"design\\" being standard cruise conditions).Moxon, Julian (1989).

The original RFP called for maximum thrust in the class.Aronstein pp. 211‚Äì215 Due to the ATF's increasing weight, thrust requirement was increased by 20% to the class in order to meet performance requirements. GE's design changed to incorporate a 12% larger fan to increase airflow as well as cooling air, particularly for the nozzles. For flight demonstration, YF120s were fitted with the larger fan, unlike the YF119 which used its original small fan. As a result, both demonstrator aircraft had higher performance with the YF120s than with the YF119s.Aronstein pp. 221‚Äì223 The YF120-powered the YF-22 and YF-23 to supercruise speeds of Mach 1.58 and Mach 1.6+ respectively.Pace, p. 232 While the YF120 engine never went into production, it was installed in the YF-22 for the high angle of attack demonstrations. The Engineering & Manufacturing Development (EMD) configuration of the F120 was tested in December 1990. Component improvements enabled it to achieve YF120 thrust levels at lower temperatures.Aronstein, p. 223 The USAF ultimately chose the Pratt & Whitney's F119 proposal for full- scale development and production. The more ambitious F120 design was judged to be riskier, and General Electric also accrued fewer testing hours than Pratt & Whitney.Aronstein, p. 227 Further developments The YF120 was also proposed as the basis for a more exotic engine, the Turbine-Based Combined Cycle (TBCC) engine that was to be used in demonstrator aircraft like the X-43B and future hypersonic aircraft. Specifically, the YF120 was to be the basis for the Revolutionary Turbine Accelerator (RTA-1). The variable cycle technology used in the YF120 would be extended to not only turn the engine into a turbojet but also into a ramjet. In that mode all airflow would bypass the core and be diverted into the afterburner-like \\"hyperburner\\" where it would be combusted like a ramjet. This proposed engine was to accelerate from 0 to Mach 4.1 (at 56,000 ft) in eight minutes.Norris, Guy (2003). GE unveils ramjet design for shuttle. Flight International. 23 Sept 2003, pg. 26.Mach 7 engine to be turbine-based (2004). Flight International. 23 Dec 2003 - 5 Jan 2004, pg. 13. Design Variable cycle The YF120's variable cycle system worked by varying the bypass ratio of the engine for different flight regimes, allowing the engine to act like either a low bypass turbofan or nearly a turbojet. As a low bypass turbofan (like competitor F119), the engine performed similarly to comparable engines. When needed, however, the engine could direct more airflow through the hot core of the engine (like a turbojet), increasing the specific thrust of the engine. This made the engine more efficient at high altitude, high thrust levels than a traditional low bypass turbofan. Fan-to-core pressure matching was performed by a variable area bypass injector (VABI).Aronstein, p. 212GE F120 Powerplant Uses Fan Bypass Door to Regulate Variable Cycle (1990). Aviation Week and Space Technology. 30 Jul 1990. Vol. 133, No. 5; pg. 21 An expected disadvantage of this variable cycle system would be increased complexity and weight. GE claims to have combated this by using simple pressure driven valves rather than complex mechanically actuated valves to divert airflow. GE stated that this system resulted in the variable cycle system adding only 10 lb to the engine. Additionally, a production F120 engine was expected to have 40% fewer parts than the F110 engine. Thrust vectoring The YF120 engine for the YF-22 featured a two-dimensional thrust vectoring nozzle. The nozzle allowed for vectoring in the pitch direction. This capability gave the aircraft it was installed in a serious advantage in pitch agility by greatly increasing the amount of nose pitching moment available to the aircraft. The pitching moment is traditionally generated by the horizontal stabilizer (and/or canard, if applicable), but with a thrust vectoring nozzle that moment can be augmented by the thrust of the engine. During high AoA demonstrations of the YF-22, the YF120 powered aircraft flew at trimmed AoA of 60 degrees at 82 knots. At this attitude the aircraft was able to demonstrate controllability. Later analysis revealed that the aircraft could have maintained controlled, trimmed flight up to 70 degrees angle of attack.Barham, Robert (1994).

It was created in 1976 due to the risk of the Netherlands being a terrorist target in the 1970s. The task The BSB was established as a bridge between the Special Assistance Unit (BBE) from the Marine Corps and the SWAT team of the police. The BSB, which is part of the military police and therefore a military organization consists only of soldiers. These are recruited from its own ranks of the military police, regional police and various special defense units (i.e. Commando Corps, Marine Corps and 11 Airmobile Brigade). All BSB'ers follow the BSB training and then further specialization (OT, AT, etc.). Also follow the candidate BSB'ers who do not come from the Royal Military Constabulary and police training for General Investigation Officer. The official job title is \\"Sergeant special assignments\\" (or the rank applicable). The BSB will in all cases act as a unit and never come out as an individual. From protecting the privacy of its members, the BSB does not comment on personal details. The BSB has four divisions: *Close Protection *Observation *Special Assignments *Arrest Team Personal security This mainly concerns the (personal) security of embassy personnel; include foreign (military) attach√©s. This VIPpers (as they are also called) works closely the DKDB ( Royal and Diplomatic Protection ) of the National Police. Observation Like any OT is the IP BSB deployed after a charge for systematic observation was issued by a prosecutor. The legal frameworks for this are given in the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Law Special powers . Systematic observation loves nothing more or less than the secretly observing people in order to (partly) to gain insight into his private life. Often this is accompanied by 'tapping' (interception) of the phone (s) of the subject. The duration of the observation says nothing about whether or not systematic. The depth and purpose though. Observation Teams use the BSB in dynamic observation nondescript cars (vehicles without special modifications) to follow, from photographing or filming. Static observation often happens from one (or several) fixed objects from which a subject (person) is viewed. This usually happens in so-called driving and follow teams of 7 to 10 members. At major events mixing members of the surveillance team is among the spectators or they take place (usually high) strategic locations. Observing 'dangerous' activists is also a task of the BSB. This is done regularly on request include the AIVD . The observation teams from the AIVD indeed are not armed, which the BSB however. Special Missions Under the mandate of special missions department under other securing POLADS (political advisors, diplomats and convicted criminals under severe threat to life). Also, Special Assignments task to perform special assignments for the state. Arrest Team The SWAT team (Arrests dings and support AOT) of the BSB will be deployed to take action in life-threatening and tactically difficult situations, such as the maintenance of armed and dangerous criminals, the overpowering of jumpers (people on the verge of committing suicide), performing specific work at height and negotiate or act during a hostage situation. The AOT BSB is widely used against foreign criminals to be arrested in the Netherlands or to be overpowered.

If ice is allowed to build up to a significant thickness it can change the shape of airfoils and flight control surfaces, degrading the performance, control or handling characteristics of the aircraft. An ice protection system either prevents formation of ice, or enables the aircraft to shed the ice before it can grow to a dangerous thickness.  Types  Section of pneumatic boot on an aircraft's wing  Pneumatic deicing boots  The pneumatic boot is usually made of layers of rubber or other elastomers, with one or more air chambers between the layers. If multiple chambers are used, they are typically shaped as stripes aligned with the long direction of the boot. It is typically placed on the leading edge of an aircraft's wings and stabilizers. The chambers are rapidly inflated and deflated, either simultaneously, or in a pattern of specific chambers only. The rapid change in shape of the boot is designed to break the adhesive force between the ice and the rubber, and allow the ice to be carried away by the relative wind flowing past the aircraft. However, the ice must be carried away cleanly from the trailing sections of the surface, or it could re-freeze behind the protected area. Re-freezing of ice in this manner was a contributing factor to the crash of American Eagle Flight 4184. Certain older designs of pneumatic boot were subject to a phenomenon known as ice bridging. If the ice had not accumulated to a sufficient thickness and fragility, malleable ice could be pushed into a shape out of reach of the inflatable sections of the boot. This problem is mostly solved in modern designs by increasing the speed of inflation/deflation action, and by alternating the timing of inflating/deflating adjacent chambers. The pneumatic boot is most appropriate for low and medium speed aircraft, especially those without leading edge lift devices such as slats. Therefore, this system is most commonly found on turbo propeller aircraft such as the Saab 340, Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia, and British Aerospace Jetstream 41. Pneumatic De-Icing boots are sometimes found on larger piston prop aircraft, smaller turbojets such as the Cessna Citation V, and some older turbojets. This device is rarely used on modern turbojet aircraft. This device was invented by the Goodrich Corporation (previously known as B.F. Goodrich) in 1923.  Electro-thermal  Electro- thermal systems use resistive circuits buried in the airframe structure to generate heat when a current is applied. The heat can be generated continuously to protect the aircraft from icing (anti-ice mode), or intermittently to shed ice as it accretes on key surfaces (de-ice). De-ice operation is generally preferred due to the lower power consumption, as the system only needs to melt the contact layer of ice for the wind-shear to shed the remainder. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is an example of a commercial airframe to use electro-thermal ice protection. In this case the resistive heating circuit is embedded inside the glass and carbon composite wing structure. Boeing claims the system uses half the energy of traditional bleed- air systems (as provided by the engines), and that drag and noise are also reduced. For metallic aircraft skin structures, etched foil resistive heating circuits have been bonded to the inside surface of skins. This approach holds the potential of enabling a lower overall power requirement than the embedded circuit approach due to its ability to operate at significantly higher power densities.http://papers.sae.org/2009-01-3165/  Capitalizing on the Increased Flexibility that Comes from High Power Density Electrothermal Deicing The Thermawing is an electrical ice protection system for general aviation. ThermaWing uses a flexible, electrically conductive, graphite foil attached to a wing's leading edge. Electric heaters heat the foil and melt the ice. A new proposal uses a special soot made of carbon nanotubes. A thin filament is spun on a winder to create a 10 micron-thick film, equivalent to an A4 sheet of paper. The film is a poor conductor of electricity, because of the air gaps between the nanotubes. Instead, current manifests as a near instantaneous rise in temperature. It heats up twice as fast as nichrome, the heating element of choice for in-flight de-icing, using half as much energy at one ten-thousandth the weight. The amount of material needed to cover the wings of a jumbo jet weighs . The material cost is approximately 1% of nichrome. Aerogel heaters could be left on continuously at low power, to prevent ice from forming.  Bleed air  A bleed air system is the method used by most larger jet aircraft to keep flight surfaces above the freezing temperature required for ice to accumulate (called anti-icing). The hot air is \\"bled\\" off the jet engine into piccolo tubes routed through wings, tail surfaces, and engine inlets. The spent bleed air is exhausted through holes in the lower surface of the wing.  Electro-mechanical  Electro-mechanical Expulsion Deicing Systems (EMEDS) use a mechanical force to knock the ice off the flight surface. Typically, actuators are installed underneath the skin of the structure. The actuator is moved to induce a shock wave in the protected surface to dislodge the ice. Cox and Company, Inc. of Plainview, NY developed a lightweight, low-power system called EMEDS that is the first ice protection technology to receive FAA certification in 50 years, and is currently in- service on multiple commercial aircraft (FAA Part 23 and Part 25) and military aircraft. Innovative Dynamics has developed a lightweight and low-power system using actuators, called EIDI. Hybrid Electro-Mechanical Expulsion Deicing Systems combine an EMEDS de-icer with an electrical heating element anti-icer. The heater prevents ice accumulation on the leading edge of the airfoil and the actuators of the EMED system remove ice that accumulates aft of the heated portion of the airfoil. Cox and Company, Inc. of Plainview, NY has developed multiple versions of Hybrid EMED systems referred to as Thermo-Mechanical Expulsion Deicing System (TMEDS). TKS Ice Protection Detail of an aircraft's tailplane with a TKS de-icing system, showing some of the thousands of tiny holes through which the de-icing fluid is pumped The TKS Ice Protection System, manufactured by CAV Ice Protection, is a fluid-based ice protection system used to help aircraft safely exit in-flight icing conditions. The system uses a glycol-based fluid to cover the critical surfaces of an aircraft and prevent the risk of any ice forming on the leading edges of the wings. The system can also break the ice that has accumulated (chemically). Developed by Tecalemit-Kilfrost-Sheepbridge Stokes (TKS), the system was primarily used during World War II by the British. During World War II, it was used for the safety and security of Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers in icing conditions. Ice Protection with the TKS Ice Protection system is achieved by mounting laser-drilled titanium porous panels on the leading edges of the airframe. The panel skin is perforated with laser-drilled holes in diameter, with . TKS fluid exudes through the panels on the leading edges of the wings, horizontal stabilizers. Fluid is also thoroughly distributed from the slinger-ring on the propeller and from the windshield spraybar. Secondary fairings or structures such as lift struts can also be protected. Engine inlets may be protected, as well. The fluid is pumped from a tank by an electrically-driven metering pump through a microfilter to proportioning units. Proportioning units contain calibrated capillary tubes that divide the flow to the individual needs of the porous panels and the slinger ring. One metering pump is provided for inadvertent systems. For systems certified for flight into known icing conditions (FIKI), two pumps are installed for redundancy and can be selected individually. Fluid for the windshield spraybar system is provided by an on-demand gear pump. One or two windshield pumps are provided depending on the certification basis. As the TKS Ice Protection system is used, any accumulation of debris is flushed out. Glycol has cleaning properties and will not harm the paint finish of the aircraft. Passive Passive systems employ hydrophobic surfaces. Appropriately designed textiles, characterised by a high level of water resistance and natural self-cleaning effect can stop the adhesion of waterAryeh Ben-Na'im Hydrophobic Interaction Plenum Press, New York, , thereby eliminating ability for ice build-up. Another passive system makes use of the amount of time that a water drop needs to be in touch with frozen material before the drop freezes and sticks. Rough surfaces, with ridges shorten the time that water stays in contact. When a drop hits any surface, it flattens into a pancake, then regains a round shape and bounces up. Ridges split large drops into smaller ones. The smaller drops re-formed and bounced away up to 40 percent quicker than the larger drops. Nature employs this concept, as shown in the difference between lotus and nasturtiums. The latter's leaves are rougher and ice less than the smoother lotus. Aircraft icing accidents result from a combination of increased weight, increased drag, decrease or loss of lift, and decrease or loss of thrust from ice accumulation on the airframe, airfoil(s), propellers (if present) and or wings, depending on the type of ice that forms (e.g. rime ice, clear ice, etc.), which is a function of the specific meteorological conditions. Also, induction ice can cause power losses in icing conditions either externally at air intakes (either turbine or piston aircraft), or locally in the induction system within the engine (e.g. the carburetor of a non-fuel injected reciprocating engine). When ice builds up by either freezing upon impingement on the leading edge or freezing as runback on aerodynamic lift or thrust surfaces, such as the wing, tailplane, and propeller blades, the modification of airflow changes the aerodynamic performance of the surfaces by modifying either their shape and/or their surface characteristics. When this happens, it results in an increase of both primary and induced drag, and decrease of lifting force or thrust. Depending on whether the net lift of a tailplane airfoil was downward or upward, then the loss of tailplane lift (upward or downward) can cause a change in pitch (often to a more nose down pitch) or, if the critical angle of attack of the tailplane is exceeded, a tailplane aerodynamic \\"stall\\". Both a decrease in lift on the wing due to an altered airfoil shape, and the increase in weight of the aircraft directly caused by the ice load will usually result in the pilot having to fly at a greater angle of attack of the airfoil to make up for the loss of lift needed to maintain an assigned altitude, or chosen rate of descent/ascent, notwithstanding power changes that are available and the airspeed desired. If the greater angle of attack exceeds the critical angle of attack, an aerodynamic stall will occur, which can occur at any airspeed and at any flight attitude, an oft-overlooked fact (even by pilots). In summary, depending on whether the icing event occurs on the wing or horizontal stabilizer/stabilator, the lifting force that is deceased can result in a pitch up or pitch down. One \\"trick\\" employed by pilots wishing to improve both the airspeed and load carrying performance of aircraft in both icing and non-icing conditions is to load the aircraft closer to its rear CG (center of gravity) limit, and/or fly with rearward (nose up) trim. This causes the pilot to have to push forward on the elevator controls, increasing the camber of the upper surface of the horizontal stabilizer/elevator (tailplane) surface. The resulting decrease in loading on the front wing then allows the front wing to fly at a lower angle of attack, farther away from an aerodynamic \\"stall\\". This can also allow less induced drag by the wing, and hence a greater cruise speed for a given power setting. Even if the aircraft loading is not changed to a more rearward CG, flying with the elevator trimmed for nose up results in having to hold forward force on the controls, which causes the elevator trim tab to increase the camber of the tailplane upper surface (albeit tiring, and therefore employed only in unusual or temporary circumstances, say during takeoff or in icing conditions), and hence lower the tailplane angle of attack.  Rotary-surface icing  Ice can also accumulate on helicopter rotor blades and aircraft propellers. The accretion causes weight and aerodynamic imbalances that are amplified due to the rapid rotation of the propeller or rotor.  Engine-inlet icing  CFM56 turbofan Ice accumulation on the leading edge (lip) of engine inlets causes flow problems and can lead to ice ingestion. In turbofan engines, laminar airflow is required at the face of the fan. Because of this, most engine ice protection systems are anti-ice systems (prevent build up).  Icephobic materials  In order to minimize ice accretion on the various surfaces of the aircraft, researchers have during the course of history sought to find icephobic materials for usage in aeronautical applications. Examples of such materials are carbon nanotubes and slippery liquid infused porous surfaces (SLIPS). Weeping wing A weeping wing is a chemical aircraft airborne ice protection system wherein a glycol-based chemical is released onto the wing surface using small orifices on the leading edge of the wing. This system provides both ice formation prevention (anti-ice) and removal of ice which has already formed (de-ice). System components * Fluid reservoir * Fluid pump * Fluid Ducting * Fluid * Calibrated orifices * Activation Circuit Operation The system is activated using a switch in the cockpit. This turns on the fluid pump, which pumps fluid out of the reservoir, through the ducting and out onto the calibrated orifices on the wing leading edge. As the fluid flows along the airstream (both on the top and bottom surfaces of the wing), a thin coat of fluid is left that protects the surface from icing. The excess fluid then leaves the wing surface and slides out behind the wing's trailing edge.

The U.S. Army paid $50,000 for the project in 1898 after Langley's successful flights with small-scale unmanned models two years earlier. The man-carrying Aerodrome as displayed at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center Design and development Langley coined the word \\"Aerodrome\\" and applied it to a series of engine-driven unmanned and manned tandem wing aircraft that were built under his supervision by Smithsonian staff in the 1890s and early 1900s. The term is derived from Greek words meaning \\"air runner\\". After a series of unsuccessful tests beginning in 1894, Langley's unmanned steam-driven model \\"Number 5\\" made a successful 90-second flight of over at about per hour at a height of to on May 6, 1896. In November, model \\"Number 6\\" flew almost . Both aircraft were launched by catapult from a houseboat in the Potomac River near Quantico, Virginia, south of Washington, D.C. The flights impressed Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt enough for him to assert that \\"the machine has worked\\" and to call for the United States Navy to create a four- officer board to study the utility of Langleys \\"flying machine\\" in March 1898, the first documented U.S. Navy expression of interest in aviation.Butler, Glen, Col., USMC, \\"That Other Air Service Centennial,\\" Naval History, June 2012, p. 54. The group approved the idea, although the Navy did not take on the project. Instead, the Board of Ordnance and Fortification of the U.S. Department of War acted on the recommendation and made $50,000 in grants to the Smithsonian for construction of a full-scale man-carrying version. Langley's technical team also built a gasoline-powered quarter-scale unmanned model, which flew successfully twice on June 18, 1901, and again with an improved engine on August 8, 1903. The full-scale Aerodrome's internal combustion engine generated 53 horsepower, about four times that of the Wright Brothers' gasoline engine of 1903. The Aerodome's other features, however, especially structure and control, left much to be desired. The Aerodrome had a primitive control system that included a cruciform tail and a centrally- mounted rudder. Langley again used a houseboat catapult for launch. He chose his chief engineer, Charles M. Manly, to ride the aircraft and operate the controls as best he might. On the first flight attempt, October 7, 1903, the craft failed to fly and dropped into the Potomac River immediately after launch. On the second attempt, December 8, the craft collapsed after launch and again fell into the river. Rescuers pulled Manly unhurt from the water each time. Langley blamed the calamities on a problem with the launch mechanism, not the aircraft. The real problem lay in his failure to consider the problems of calculating stress on an airframe and correct control of an aircraft. He made no further tests, and his experiments became the object of scorn in newspapers and the U.S. Congress. Nine days after the December 8, 1903, failure, the Wright brothers conducted four successful flights near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. 1914 modification and flight tests William E. \\"Gink\\" Doherty coaxes the structurally modified Langley Aerodrome into the air above the surface of Keuka Lake near Hammondsport, New York in 1914. With Smithsonian approval, Glenn Curtiss extensively modified the Aerodrome and made a few short flights in it in 1914, as part of an unsuccessful attempt to bypass the Wright Brothers' patent on aircraft and to vindicate Langley. Based on these flights, the Smithsonian displayed the Aerodrome in its museum as the first heavier-than-air manned, powered aircraft \\"capable of flight.\\" This action triggered a feud with Orville Wright (Wilbur Wright had died in 1912), who accused the Smithsonian of misrepresenting flying machine history. Orville backed up his protest by refusing to donate the original 1903 Kitty Hawk Flyer to the Smithsonian, instead donating it to extensive collections of the Science Museum of London in 1928. The dispute finally ended in 1942 when the Smithsonian published details of the Curtiss modifications to the Aerodrome and recanted its claims for the aircraft. Curtiss called the preparations \\"restoration\\" claiming that the only addition to the design was pontoons to support testing on the lake but critics including patent attorney Griffith Brewer called them alterations of the original design. In a June 22, 1914, letter to the New York Times Brewer asked \\"Why, if the Langley flying machine was a practical flying machine, did not those in charge of the machine try to fly it without alteration?\\" Brewer also questioned the decision to allow someone who had been found guilty of patent infringement to be chosen to prepare the historic aircraft for tests. Curtiss flew the modified Aerodrome from Keuka Lake, New York, hopping a few feet off the surface of the water several times for no longer than five seconds at a time. Photos of a bit of daylight beneath the pontoons taken at an additional test conducted closer to shore a few days later were published by the media. Preservation Two of Langley's scale model Aerodromes survive to this day. Aerodrome No. 5, the first Langley heavier-than-air craft to fly, is on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. Aerodrome No. 6 is located at Wesley W. Posvar Hall, University of Pittsburgh, and was restored in part by the engineering students. Fabric on the wings and tail is the only new material, although the tail and several wing ribs were rebuilt using vintage wood from the same time period provided by the Smithsonian. Langley had been an astronomy professor at the university before he ascended to the Smithsonian's top job. The man-carrying Aerodrome survived after being rebuilt and tested by Curtiss and was converted back to Langley's original 1903 configuration by Smithsonian staff. It occupied a place of honor in the Smithsonian museum until 1948 when the Institution welcomed home the original 1903 Wright Flyer from the UK. Afterward, the Aerodrome resided out of view of the public for many years at the Paul Garber Facility in Suitland, Maryland. Today it is displayed at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F.

He is predominantly a foe of the Fantastic Four, and a notable foe of Patsy Walker. Publication history Nicholas Scratch first appeared in Fantastic Four #185 (August 1977) and was created by Len Wein (writer) and George P√©rez (artist). The name \\"Nicholas Scratch\\" is an amalgam of colloquial and euphemistic names for the Devil: \\"Old Nick\\" and \\"Old Scratch\\" or \\"Mr. Scratch\\" (as used in \\"The Devil and Daniel Webster\\"). Fictional character biography Nicholas Scratch is the son of Agatha Harkness and was a resident of the hidden community of New Salem, Colorado, a secret community populated by magic users. Agatha left the reclusive community to live among normal people, and in time even became a nanny to Franklin Richards, son of Reed and Sue Richards of the Fantastic Four. Scratch fathered seven children, who would come to be known as Salem's Seven. Scratch, now a warlock, became the leader of New Salem and brought the community to believe that it had been betrayed by Harkness through her dealings with the outside world. The New Salem witches then abducted Agatha for her trial and execution. They also abducted Franklin Richards in the process, which then caused the Fantastic Four to follow them back to New Salem. Although initially defeated and captured, the Four escaped and confronted Scratch at Harkness's trial, where all of the New Salem community was present. They countered Scratch's claims against Harkness by explaining that they hadn't known of New Salem until Scratch's actions made them aware of it. Outraged, Scratch attacked, swaying the community against him. The New Salem community then exiled him and banished him to a dimension known as the Dark Realm.Fantastic Four #185-186 (August- September 1977) From the Dark Realm, Scratch restored the Salem's Seven's powers and took mental control of the Fantastic Four. He attempted a world conquest, but was thwarted and confined to the Dark Realm by Agatha Harkness.Fantastic Four Annual #14 From the Dark Realm, he later took mental possession of Franklin Richards. He had Salem's Seven takeover New Salem, but was defeated by Agatha Harkness and Gabriel, Devil Hunter. Scratch's powers were removed by Harkness, leaving him as a normal human being.Fantastic Four #222-223 Agatha Harkness eventually disowned Scratch as her son. Later, after the destruction of New Salem,Vision and the Scarlet Witch Vol. 2 #2-3 Scratch resurfaced in the town of Centerville as \\"Mayor Nicholas.\\" The whole town of Centerville and all of its inhabitants had entered a contract as an amusement park version of \\"America's Heartland Next-Door.\\" When Patsy Walker returned to visit her hometown, she discovered that the town's whole population was possessed by demons. A team composed of Avengers and Thunderbolts helped clear the town, which was apparently being victimized by a convoluted conspiracy composed of the amusement park developers, the Sons of the Serpent, and Salem's Seven. After defeating them, the Avengers/Thunderbolts team departed but Patsy elected to remain in Centerville.Avengers Annual 2000 Soon Patsy discovered that Scratch was the mastermind behind the ongoing haunting of Centerville. She defeated him and accused him of serving Mephisto, but in reply, Scratch called down his true new master Dormammu. Abducting Hellcat, Dormammu then revealed his plans for domination via conquest of Hell, and that Scratch would become Sorcerer Supreme. Dormammu's plans were later defeated by the other Hell Lords causing Hell to freeze over. Dormammu then fled with Scratch. Scratch had not been seen until he was featured in The Resurrection of Nicholas Scratch three-part storyline in Marvel Knights 4 where Scratch manipulated Salem's Seven and the Fantastic Four into releasing Shuma-Gorath only for the Fantastic Four, Diablo, Doctor Strange, and his own children to defeat him and Shuma-Gorath. Scratch was banished to Hell, where he made an alliance with Mephisto. Powers and abilities Scratch possesses vast indeterminate power through manipulation of the forces of magic. He has teleported, fired bolts of force and energy and has traveled between dimensions. He also has shown the ability to control and influence minds. He has animated gargoyles to serve him. He could gain more power by the tapping of extradimensional energy by invoking entities or objects of power existing in dimensions tangential to Earth's through the recitation of spells. He had the mental powers of mesmerism, thought-casting, illusion-casting, and mental-probing. For a time, Nicholas Scratch was deprived of his supernatural powers by a spell cast by Agatha Harkness. Scratch wields the Satan Staff, a mystical power object that served as a focus for Scratch's magical powers, although he could employ his powers without the staff. Using the staff, he could direct the combined magical powers of the entire community of New Salem when they allowed him to do so.

This feature straddles the border between Egypt and Libya. The name of this feature is derived from the Arabic word for \\"large\\", and also from its location near the Gilf Kebir (\\"Great Barrier\\") region in southwest Egypt. Based solely on their interpretations of the remote sensing data, they argue that this feature is an exceptionally large, double-ringed, extraterrestrial impact crater. They suggest that the crater's original appearance has been obscured by wind and water erosion over time. Finally, they speculated that this feature might be the source of the yellow-green silica glass fragments, known as \\"Libyan desert glass\\", that can be found across part of Egypt's Libyan Desert. They neither conducted any fieldwork at this feature nor studied any samples collected from it.El-Baz, F., and E. Ghoneim (2007) Largest crater shape in the Great Sahara revealed by multi-spectral images and radar data. International Journal of Remote Sensing. 28(2): 451‚Äì458. However, the Kebira Crater is currently not listed in the Earth Impact Database.Anonymous (nd) Africa (Impact Craters), Earth Impact Database , Planetary and Space Science Centre, University of New Brunswick, New Brunswick, Canada. Field trips to investigate the feature have found no supporting evidence. The \\"central uplift\\" clearly retains the horizontal bedding of the surrounding sandstone tableland, providing clear evidence against a possible impact origin.Br√ºgge. N. (2012) A not credible message to a so named crater \\"Kebira.\\" in Geology of the Libyan Desert, accessed 20 October 2013.Orti, L., M. Di Martino, M. Morelli, C. Cigolini, E. Pandeli, and A.

Meteoritics & Planetary Science 43(10):1629‚Äì1639.Di Martino M., L. Orti, L. Matassoni, M. Morelli, R. Serra, and A. Buzzigoli (2006) Non-impact Origin of the Craterfield in the Gilf Kebir Region (SW Egypt), online PDF file. Characteristics According to their interpretations of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM + ) images, Radarsat-1 data, and SRTM data, El-Baz and Ghoneim described this circular feature as having a central peak, an inner ring, and discontinuous outer rim. The hypothetical outer rim is 31 kilometres (19 mi) in diameter. This feature consists of well-cemented, coarse- and fine- grained sandstones of the Gilf Kebir and Wadi Malik formations.Longinelli, A., G. Sighinolfi, V. de Michele, and E. Selmo (2011) Œ¥18O and chemical composition of Libyan Desert Glass, country rocks, and sands: New considerations on target material. Meteoritics & Planetary Science. 46(2):218-227. Were this an impact structure, it would be bigger than the largest confirmed impact structure in the region, the Oasis crater in Libya, which is approximately half the size, with a diameter of approximately 18 kilometres (11 mi). It is estimated that a meteorite large enough to have created a Kebira-sized impact structure would have been roughly 1 kilometre (0.75 mi) in diameter. Origin of Kebira Crater Because it is based entirely on remote sensing data and the current lack of formally published field studies, ideas about the impact origin of the Kebira Crater remain unconfirmed and untested according to papers published in the formal scientific literature.Schmieder, M., E. Buchner, and D.P. LeHeron (2009). The Jebel Hadid structure (AlKufrah Basin, SE Libya)‚ÄîA possible impact structure and potential hydrocarbon trap? Marine and Petroleum Geology 26(3):310‚Äì318. In one paper, it and some other recently proposed impact structures are described as being \\"dubious.\\"Reimold, W.U. (2010) The First Arab Impact Cratering and Astrogeology Conference, Amman, Jordan, 9‚Äì11 November 2009‚ÄîAn appreciation. Meteoritics & Planetary Science. 45(2):157‚Äì160. The Impact Field Studies Group's Impact Database (formerly Suspected Earth Impact Sites, SEIS) list rates this as improbable for an impact origin. This catalog notes that the observed circular area was visible in Google Earth as having a flat top in the center. They suggest that the flat tops indicates that the strata within the center of this feature is flat-lying and undisturbed.Rajmon, D. (2010) Impact Database 2010.1. Impact Field Studies Group. If this is an impact structure, the strata within the center of it would not be flat lying. Instead, the strata within it center would be complexly and distinctly folded, tilted, and faulted as a result of an extraterrestrial impact.French, B. M. (1998) Traces of catastrophe. A Handbook of Shock-Metamorphic Effects in Terrestrial Meteorite Impact Structures\\" Lunar and Planetary Institute, Houston, Texas. 120 pp. After the existence of a possible impact structure was announced, in early March 2006 an expedition traveled through the site and informally published their findings: \\"[C]ontinued north . . towards a large circular feature that was recently announced to be an 'impact crater' . . We drove past the 'central uplift' along its western edge, then drove into the central part. It is evident, that what is considered the 'central uplift' is in fact nothing more than an eroded outlier of the Gilf, the undisturbed horizontal bedding being clearly visible at all times. The circular shape appears to be pure coincidence, the whole feature is the result of drainage patterns and subsequent eolian erosion, there is nothing to suggest its impact origin.\\" And \\"We were now in the crater area, looking at the western edge of the central uplift area of the 'crater'. What we saw were uniform horizontal layers of sedimentary rocks, undisturbed except by the processes of natural erosion. The jumbled, chaotic rock formation that we would expect to see in the central uplift area of a crater was not evident at all.\\" A study published in Meteoritics & Planetary Science reported a field investigation of another \\"crater field\\" East of the Gilf Kebir, also reported based on remote sensing data. After analyzing the presence/absence of several geologic features associated with impact craters, such as target rocks, breccias, pseudo-shatter cones, and circular morphology, the authors concluded: \\"[T]here are [sic] no clear and unequivocal evidence supporting the impact origin of the circular structures in Glif Kebir region; until substantial evidence is produced, it's necessary to identify the origin of the craters in others [sic] endogenic geological processes.\\" They proposed the most likely alternative source of the crater to be a hydrothermal vent, although they went on to say: \\"However, even this hypothesis is not fully satisfactory: probably these complex and peculiar features are the result of interaction between different geological process. At present, this hypothesis cannot be completely constrained; further investigations are necessary. Anyway, the lacking of clear evidences of a meteoritic impact and the geological framework of the investigated area, lead us to confirm the hydrothermal-volcanic hypothesis. Libyan desert glass source As noted by Longinelli and others, the Carboniferous Wadi Malik Formation and erosional remnants of the Lower Cretaceous Gilf Kebir Formation, which are exposed within this proposed impact structure, \\"have been considered as possible source materials for LDG despite the lack of clear evidence\\" for the origin of this feature as the result of an extraterrestrial impact. Because of its size and hypothesized origin, El-Baz and Ghoneim speculated that the Kebira Crater was the source of Libyan desert glass that is found scattered over about within the Great Sand Sea in western Egypt and near the Libyan border. Aboud also suggested that if the Kebira Crater is an impact structure, it might be the solution to the mystery about the source of Libyan desert glass.Aboud, T. (2009) Libyan Desert Glass: has the enigma of its origin been resolved? Physics Procedia. 2(3):1425‚Äì1432. However, he cautioned that origin of this feature was still largely conjecture that required additional research to confirm. Ramirez-Cardona and others also suggested that the Kebira Crater might be the source of Libyan desert glass. Instead of proposing that Libyan desert glass was ejected from this feature by an impact, they hypothesized that it was transported from it by an Oligocene-Miocene Gilf River system that contained the Kebira Crater within its drainage basin. They also noted that evidence for the Kebira Crater being an impact structure lacked direct field observations.Ramirez-Cardona, M., A. El-Barkooky, M. Hamdan, K. Flores-Castro, N. I. Jimenez-Martinez, and M. Mendoza-Espinosa (2008) On the Libyan Desert Silica Glass (LDSG) transport model from a hypothetical impact structure. PIS-01 General contributions to impact structures, International Geological Congress Oslo 2008, Oslo, Norway. Most recently, Longinelli and others studied the oxygen isotope and chemical composition of Libyan desert glass and samples of sands and sandstone from its proposed source areas. They found that the mean oxygen isotope values of the sandstone samples from the Kebira Crater differed greatly from their Libyan desert glass samples.

She was born at Marcourt (Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge)(from which comes the appellation \\"de M√©ricourt\\"), a small town in Luxembourg province, in modern Belgium. She was active in the French Revolution and worked within the Austrian Low Countries to also foster revolution. She was held in an Austrian prison from 1791-1792 for being an agent provocateur in Belgium. She was a cofounder of a Parisian revolutionary club and had warrants for her arrest issued in France for her alleged participation in the October Days uprising. She is known both for her portrayal in the French Revolutionary press and for her subsequent mental breakdown and institutionalization. Early life (1767‚Äì1789) She was born Anne-Jos√®phe Terwagne in Marcourt, Rendeux, to Pierre Terwagne (b. 1731) and Anne-√âlisabeth Lahaye (1732‚Äì1767). Her mother died after giving birth to her third child, leaving Anne-Jos√®phe alone with her father and two brothers; Pierre-Jos√®phe (b. 1764) and Jos√®phe (b. 1767). After her mother died, she was sent to live with her aunt in Li√©ge and was put into a convent school where she learned how to sew. About a year after Anne- Jos√®phe began school, her aunt married and stopped paying for her school. Anne-Jos√®phe fled back to her father after he remarried because she was forced to be a house maid and tend to her aunt's children. Life at her father's was no better, her stepmother treated her just as poorly as her aunt did. Her eldest brother went to Germany to stay with relatives by the name of Campinados. At the age of 13, Anne-Jos√®phe and her younger brother went to Xhoris to stay with some of their father's relatives. While in Xhoris, she constantly was snubbed and overworked to the point where she could not take it any longer. As a result, she went back to her aunt in Li√®ge, but found that she was still mistreated. After realizing the need to start her own life, she learned to herd cows in Sougn√©, a province in Limburg. A year later, she went back to Li√®ge to work as a seamstress, only to face the same discontent with her life as before. She proceeded to seek refuge with a different aunt by the name of Clamend who lived in Xhoris. Before long, a woman asked Anne-Jos√®phe to come to Antwerp with her to care for her daughter. The woman abandoned her at the inn they were staying at after a few weeks. Luckily for Anne-Jos√®phe, a woman by the name of Madame Colbert saw something within her and took her in as the governess to her children. Anne-Jos√®phe was sixteen when she started living with Madame Colbert; her life consisted of teaching Madame Colbert's children and studying operatic singing in several European capitals. They ended up at Madame Colbert's house in London where eventually a rich Englishman set his eyes on Anne-Jos√®phe. One night when Madame Colbert was out, the Englishman entered the home begging for Anne-Jos√®phe to elope with him. According to her account after she declined, she was abducted and taken by force. When he became of age and inherited his fortune, the unmarried couple went to Paris to live their lives. She quickly caught onto his lavish ways and tried to work with him, but in 1787 he returned to England leaving her in Paris with 200,000 livres. At some point between 1784 and 1787 she crafted a relationship with 60-year-old Marquis de Persan, a councillor of the Parliament of Paris. Much about their relationship remains a mystery, but what is known is that they communicated through letters, and that he gifted her very generously. Anne-Joseph operated under the alias Mademoiselle Campinado whenever she worked as a courtesan. After meeting renowned Italian tenor Giacomo David for the first time, she was inspired her to break away from Marquis de Persan and pursue her singing career. She found a noteworthy castrato teacher named Giusto Fernando Tenducci and because she could not afford the full cost of the lessons with the help of Tenducci's attorney they drafted up an agreement. She had no idea of Tenducci's plan to scam her out of money so he could pay off his debts. While traveling towards her father, she got news that her father had died and so she was forced to change her plans. Tenducci was not able to execute his plan because she no longer had a reason to visit and drop off a large sum of money. Tenducci proceeded to convince her to travel to Italy with him, her two brothers, and her half brother Pierrot. She was under the impression that she was going to be reimbursed for the travel expenses. They left to Genoa, Italy at some point between May 1787 and February 1788. After recognizing his true intentions, she sought help from friends and lawyers who assured her that the contract was invalid. In order to go to Rome like she now desired, Anne-Jos√®phe needed money. In March 1789, she wrote to Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Perregaux, a Swiss banker, thanking him for his assistance in acquiring payment from Marquis de Persan, asking for a loan to buy her eldest brother a managership, and requesting letters of recommendation for Rome and Naples. Rumors about the revolution began surfacing in Rome. In May 1789, after her younger brother was situated in Rome, she traveled from Italy to Paris, where she became swept up in the early stirrings of the revolution. Role in French Revolution (1789‚Äì1790) King's cockade and National Assembly Anne-Jos√®phe's first involvement in the revolution was on 17 July 1789 when King Louis XVI was at the H√¥tel de Ville, sanctifying the revolution while wearing a tricolored cockade. She dressed in a man's riding habit and a round hat in order to appear as a man to avoid the discrimination faced by women. On 4 August 1789 she attended an important National Assembly meeting discussing the rapidly spreading revolution. By the end of the month the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was passed. She decided to move to Rue de Noailles in Versailles to ensure that she make it to all of the National Assembly meetings. She learned as much as she could about the unfolding events like the Women's March on Versailles so she could understand the issues and begin to help. In October 1789, she moved to Paris so she could continue to attend the National Assembly meetings which took place in there. Society of Friends of the Law In January 1790 she founded, along with Gilbert Romme, the Soci√©t√© des amis de la loi (\\"Society of Friends of the Law\\"), a club that sought to encourage and assist patriotic work in the provinces.Roudinesco, p. 33-5 The club was short-lived, and Anne- Jos√®phe turned her revolutionary zeal into oratory at the Club des Cordeliers and the terraces of the National Assembly. Frustrated by the minimal opportunities available to female patriots, she supported the formation of mixed-sex and women's patriotic clubs. Around this time is when she became known as Th√©roigne de M√©ricourt. Rumors from the press Th√©roigne was beginning to realize that the majority of the supporters of the revolution were interested in the rights of men and not in the rights of women. Beginning in November 1789, the Parisian royalist press began to construct a flamboyant and infamous caricature of Th√©roigne as a \\"patriots' whore\\" and \\"female war chief.\\"Roudinesco, p. 31 According to the pages of these pamphlets, she assaulted the Bastille and led the October Days march on Versailles; she fought soldiers and was \\"ever to be found where the unrest was greatest,\\" attired in a \\"scarlet riding-habit and... black plume.\\" She was portrayed as a shameless libertine who was sexually involved with \\"Deputy Populus\\" (\\"the people\\")Hamel, p. 119 and one tabloid wrote that \\"every representative [of the National Assembly] may fairly claim to be the father of her child.\\" Austrian imprisonment (1790‚Äì1792) In May 1790, impoverished and much affected by the libels of the royalist press, Th√©roigne left Paris for Marcourt. After a short stay, she proceeded to Liege, in which town she was seized by warrant of the Austrian Government, and conveyed first to Tyrol and thereafter to the Kufstein Fortress, where she was interrogated about her revolutionary activities. She was taken by mercenaries on a 10-day journey to Austria during which she was bullied and nearly raped by her three captors. The Austrians, influenced by Th√©roigne's portrayal in the Paris tabloids, attributed to her an exaggerated role in the Revolution. They portrayed her as a subversive \\"Pythia,\\" a possible spy who had corrupted soldiers with inflammatory rhetoric, threatened the royal family, and instigated the October Days.Roudinesco, p. 67 Fran√ßois de Blanc was appointed by Prince Kaunitz, the Imperial Chancellor, to be Th√®roigne's interrogator. After about a month of heavy interrogation, Blanc found that she had no useful information to offer and that many of the rumors regarding her were false. Eventually Blanc grew an affection to her and arranged for her release after he discovered that she had many health issues, including depression, insomnia, migraines, and coughing of blood. Role in the French Revolution cont. (1792‚Äì1793) Return to Paris In January 1792, Th√©roigne returned to Paris. News of her Austrian captivity had preceded her, and she was welcomed as a hero. On 1 February, she spoke at the Jacobin Club, where she described her ordeal and was lauded as \\"one of the first Amazons of liberty.\\"Hamel, p. 272 Throughout the spring of 1792, she campaigned for women's rights to bear arms, and in March argued for the establishment of a battalion of women who might defend the city. Her recruiting work for this battalion, however, proved unpopular, and she was denounced to the Jacobins for causing unrest in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Tuileries palace During the insurrection of 10 August, Th√©roigne was involved with the death of royalist prisoners at the Place Vend√¥me. That Theroigne lynched to death the royalist pamphleteer Fran√ßois-Louis Suleau is not true. She later was awarded a civic crown for her courage on 10 August 1792.Hamel, p. 322 Affiliation with the Gironde Th√©roigne's revolutionary activities remained subdued for the remainder of 1792, but she often was seen at the Jacobins in her riding habit.Hamel, p. 323 In early 1793, she composed a series of placards arguing for the active involvement of women in encouraging patriotic duty. Th√©roigne had, by this point, allied herself with the Girondins, a political faction at odds with the radical Jacobins. On 15 May, Th√©roigne was delivering a speech in the Jardin des Tuileries when she was attacked by a group of women allied with the Jacobins. The women, objecting to her pro-Girondin sentiments, stripped her naked and beat her severely. She was rescued by the intervention of Jean-Paul Marat, but suffered afterward from headaches and mental troubles. Institutionalization and death (1794‚Äì1817) Th√©roigne's behavior became erratic, and on 20 September 1794, she was certified insane and put into an asylum in Faubourg Marceau.Hamel, p. 345 She ultimately was sent to La Salp√™tri√®re Hospital in 1807, where she lived for 10 years, intermittently lucid and speaking constantly about the revolution. Following a short illness, she died there on 9 June 1817.Hamel, p. 355 Fact and fiction in the French Revolution The history of this fictional Th√©roigne came to overshadow and confuse her actual actions during this time. By her own account, she was not present at the fall of the Bastille, nor did she march on Versailles during the October Days; rather, she had lived at Versailles throughout the summer of 1789, attending debates at the National Assembly and meeting with political figures such as J√©r√¥me P√©tion, Camille Desmoulins, and the Abb√© Siey√®s.Roudinesco, p. 28 She did indeed, while at Versailles, dress in a man's riding habit, but she did not lead any insurrectionary actions.

ATI Avivo was designed to offload video decoding, encoding, and post-processing from a computer's CPU to a compatible GPU. ATI Avivo compatible GPUs have lower CPU usage when a player and decoder software that support ATI Avivo is used. ATI Avivo has been long superseded by Unified Video Decoder (UVD) and Video Coding Engine (VCE). Background The GPU wars between ATI and NVIDIA have resulted in GPUs with ever-increasing processing power since early 2000s. To parallel this increase in speed and power, both GPU makers needed to increase video quality as well, in 3D graphics applications the focus in increasing quality has mainly fallen on anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering. However it has dawned upon both companies that video quality on the PC would need improvement as well and the current APIs provided by both companies have not seen many improvements over a few generations of GPUs. Therefore, ATI decided to revamp its GPU's video processing capability with ATI Avivo, in order to compete with NVIDIA PureVideo API. In the time of release of the latest generation Radeon HD series, the successor, the ATI Avivo HD was announced, and was presented on every Radeon HD 2600 and 2400 video cards to be available July, 2007 after NVIDIA announced similar hardware acceleration solution, PureVideo HD. In 2011 Avivo is renamed to AMD Media Codec Package, an optional component of the AMD Catalyst software. The last version is released in August 2012. As of 2013, the package is no longer offered by AMD. Features ATI Avivo During capturing, ATI Avivo amplifies the source, automatically adjust its brightness and contrast. ATI Avivo implements 12-bit transform to reduce data loss during conversion; it also utilizes motion adaptive 3D comb filter, automatic color control, automatic gain control, hardware noise reduction and edge enhancement technologies for better video playback quality. In decoding, the GPU core supports hardware decoding of H.264, VC-1, WMV9, and MPEG-2 videos to lower CPU utilization (the bitstream processing/entropy decoding still requires CPU processing). ATI Avivo supports vector adaptive de-interlacing and video scaling to reduce jaggies, and spatial/temporal dithering, which attempts to simulate 10-bit color quality on 8-bit and 6-bit displays during process stage. ATI Avivo HD The successor of ATI Avivo is the ATI Avivo HD, which consists of several parts: integrated 5.1 surround sound HDMI audio controller, dual integrated HDCP encryption key for each DVI port (to reduce license costs), the Theater 200 chip for VIVO capabilities, the Xilleon chip for TV overscan and underscan correction, the Theater 200 chip as well as the originally-presented ATI Avivo Video Converter. However, most of the important hardware decoding functions of ATI Avivo HD are provided by the accompanied Unified Video Decoder (UVD) and the Advanced Video Processor (AVP) which supports hardware decoding of H.264/AVC and VC-1 videos (and included bitstream processing/entropy decoding which was absent in last generation ATI Avivo). For MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and MPEG-4/DivX videos, motion compensation and iDCT (inverse discrete cosine transform) will be done instead. The AVP retrieves the video from memory; handles scaling, de-interlacing and colour correction; and writes it back to memory. The AVP also uses 12-bit transform to reduce data loss during conversion, same as previous generation ATI Avivo. HDMI supports the transfer of video together with 8-channel 96 kHz 24-bit digital audio (and optionally Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio streams for external decoding by AV receivers, since HDMI 1.3). Integration of an audio controller in the GPU core capable of surround sound output eliminates the need for S/PDIF connection from motherboard or sound card to the video card, for synchronous video and audio output via HDMI cable. The Radeon HD 2900 series lacked the UVD feature, but still was given the ATI Avivo HD label. ATI Avivo Video Converter ATI has also released a transcoder software dubbed \\"ATI Avivo Video Converter\\", which supports transcoding between H.264, VC-1, WMV9, WMV9 PMC, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, DivX video formats, as well as formats used in iPod and PSP. Earlier versions of this software uses only the CPU for transcoding, but have been locked for exclusive use with the ATI X1000 series of GPUs. Software modifications have made it possible to use version 1.12 of converter on a wider range of graphics adapters. The ATI Avivo Video Converter for Windows Vista was available with the release of Catalyst 7.9 (September 2007 release, version 8.411). The ATI Avivo Video Converter with GPU transcoding acceleration is now also available for use with HD 4800 and HD 4600 series graphics cards and is included with the Catalyst 8.12 drivers. Support for Vista x64 is available via a separate download starting with Catalyst 9.6 (9-6_vista32-64_xcode). The new software is faster than Badaboom, an encoder that uses NVIDIA's CUDA to accelerate encoding, but has a higher CPU utilization than Badaboom. One review reported visual problems with iPod and WMV playback using Catalyst version 8.12, and although concluding there was no clear winners, if forced to choose would go with the Avivo converter.

The program made Smallwood a household name throughout Newfoundland. Memorial University News Release In November 1943 Smallwood left the program to operate a pig farm in Gander, and was succeeded as the Barrelman by journalist Michael Harrington. Harrington continued the show until 1955. Subsequently, Smallwood became a leading figure in Newfoundland politics. A barrelman is an individual who was stationed in the crow's nest of a ship and was the first to spot any sign of danger and the one who first sighed land.

The terms dispositional belief and occurrent belief refer, in the former case, to a belief that is held in the mind but not currently being considered, and in the latter case, to a belief that is currently being considered by the mind. In Bourdieu's theory of fields, dispositions are the natural tendencies of each individual to take on a specific position in any field. There is no strict determinism through one's dispositions. The habitus is the choice of positions according to one's dispositions. However, in retrospect a space of possibles can always be observed. A disposition is not a process or event in some duration in time, but rather the state, preparation, or tendency of a structure \\"in waiting\\". In the field of possibilities its actual triggering has a statistical value.  In metaphysics  The debate about dispositions in metaphysics attempts to understand the fundamental nature of properties, including how they relate to laws of nature. The initial question asks if dispositions are real. Realism about dispositions, or dispositionalism, argues that dispositions are causally efficacious properties inherent to objects that are sufficient to produce change. Consider fragility. If a glass is suitably struck, it will break. Fragility is a property of the glass that accounts for this breaking. Paradigmatic examples of dispositional properties include fragility, solubility, and flammability. Dispositionalism maintains that even paradigmatic examples of what appears to be qualitative such as squareness has causal powers (for instance - when combined with the property of hardness - to make a square impression in soft wax).[Shoemaker, S., 1980, ‚ÄòCausality and Properties‚Äô, in P. van Inwagen (ed.), Time and Cause: Essays Presented to Richard Taylor, Dordrecht: Reidel, 109‚Äì135.] This view is historically argued for by Aristotle and Leibniz. Contemporary proponents include Sydney Shoemaker, U.T Place, Stephen Mumford, Alexander Bird, George Molnar, Brian Ellis.Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Dispositions Others answer that dispositions are not real properties. Anti-realism about dispositions, or categoricalism, argues that dispositions are ontologically derivative of the interaction categorical (or qualitative) properties and laws. Accordingly calling a glass fragile, is useful shorthand for describing the potential interactions of its microstructure (a categorical property) and the laws of nature; dispositions are not additional elements of being.Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Dispositions Since the microstructure and laws are enough to explain fragility, there is no causal role for a dispositional property, here fragility, to play. This view is historically argued for by Descartes, Boyle, Hume and the logical positivists. Contemporary proponents, including David Lewis, David Malet Armstrong, and Jonathan Schaffer, continue in a neo-Humaen, empiricist tradition that argues for categoricalism on the assumption that there are no necessary connections between distinct existences.[Hume, D. (1748)An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Oxford: ClarendonPress 1975, ed. L.A. Selby-Bigge and P.H. Nidditch.] Middle ground views are possible. The most notable is the Limit (or Identity) View defended by Charles B. Martin and John Heil. According to this view, dispositional and categorical - or as Martin prefers: \\"qualitative,\\" because categorical seems to be misleading - predicates are different ways of identifying one and the same property.[6] Additionally, the properties lies on a spectrum in which it could approach either limit; however, it can never reach either end because those concepts are unrealisable. Ontologically, however, there is no real difference between the two. Fragility, for example, is both a real disposition of glass to break upon being struck and an abstraction from the underlying molecular structure. Squareness, to take another example, is both a quality of having four sides of equal length that meet at equal angles and an abstraction from the fact this property interacts with its environment to leave square impressions on soft wax (when combined with the property ‚Äòhardness‚Äô). In hermeneutics In hermeneutics a disposition provides a way in which knowledge can be organised. Robbie Shilliam defines an intellectual disposition as framing \\"a set of elements into a coherent problem at the same time as this framing clarifies ethical commitments to the redressing of that problem.\\" He derives this from the french term Dispositif used by Michel Foucault and developed by Giorgio Agamben. However, following Jeffrey Bussolini, he distinguishes a disposition from an apparatus. This then enables a periodisation within a particular topic as the way a set of elements are framed differently as the social and political contexts changes. Shilliam applies this to the Black presence in British Empire creating a periodisation of academic dispositions as follows: the white abolitionist disposition, the colonial development disposition and upon the dismantling of the empire, the race relations disposition.  In law  In law, a disposition is a civil or criminal hearing where a case can be resolved.  In educational research  In educational research, a learning disposition are characteristics or attitudes to learning. These may be learned. Some examples are taking responsibility, grit and persistence when faced with problems.  In religion   In the Catholic Church  In Catholic thought, \\"disposition\\" has two meanings. Firstly, it may refer to a deliberately practised habit of behaving in a certain way, for example, \\"a virtue is an habitual and firm disposition to do the good.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, par. 1803 Secondly, it may refer to a state of a person that is required for reception of a sacrament, for example, a disposition of genuine repentance is required for the forgiveness of sins in confession.Catholic Dictionary, Sacramental dispositions.

He was one of Britain's most successful espionage agents as a prisoner of war following his capture by German forces, and, following the war's conclusion, acted as a prosecution witness in trials for treason. Prisoner of war Before he left England he had been sent on a special course for spies operating in enemy hands. He was told that he would be of more use as a POW than as a combat soldier. He was captured at Dunkirk on 29 May 1940 and remained a prisoner of war until 1945. He volunteered to serve at the Blechhammer POW camp in Upper Silesia, and the fact that he had been a member of the British Union of Fascists before the war helped him ingratiate himself with the Germans and strike up a relationship with the camp commandant. In the summer of 1942 a special camp was established to separate potential collaborators from other British POWs, Stalag III-D near Berlin. This in turn was divided into Special Detachment 999 (an officers' camp) and Special Detachment 517 (for other ranks). Both were presented by the Germans as \\"holiday camps\\" away from the poor rations, hard work and cold of normal camps, but the camp security was run by the Abwehr. Brown was one of the prisoners sent to Freigegeben (Open Prison) Stalag III-D for an initial examination. A former member of the British Union of Fascists, he had developed a good relationship with the Germans, which he exploited to run a very efficient blackmarket operation among the conscripted foreign workers, using some of the profits to buy \\"luxury\\" items such as extra food, medicine for the camp hospital and even musical instruments for the camp band. Brown also had a hidden radio so was aware of the course of the war. At Stalag III-D Brown quickly realised something was wrong, and after his visit he returned to Blechhammer. There he had met Captain Julius Green, a Jewish-Glaswegian officer who was the camp's dentist. Green gave Brown the codes and the means to pass intelligence back to London through MI9's Escape and Evasion Network. Brown decided to return to Stalag III-D as soon as possible; not only were the conditions better, he was suspicious of what the Germans were planning. After a carefully orchestrated row with the senior British NCOs at Blechhammer he persuaded the Commandant, Rittmeister Prinz Von Hohenlohe, to transfer him back to Stalag III-D. He arrived on 12 June 1943 where he was selected by Major Heimpel of the Gestapo to be senior British NCO of Special Detachment 517 based at Genshagen, in the Teltow-Fl√§ming district of Berlin. Throughout all this time, while being distrusted by the British P.O.W.s, he was reporting to MI6 by coded letters, giving guidance on targets for bomber attacks. More particularly he was engaged in subverting the German proposal to form a British Free Corps to fight for Germany. His cohorts included opera singer Margery Booth, a fellow British spy, who on one occasion whilst entertaining the camp inmates sang before Hitler just after Brown had hidden secret documents in her dress; Hitler subsequently sent her red roses wrapped in a Swastika flag. Brown was instrumental in identifying the British traitor John Amery, and both Brown and Booth had contact with William Joyce (Lord Haw-Haw), and were recruited by Joyce as a broadcaster on the German Concordia radio service; both later identified him post war, and were witnesses at his trial. At one point Brown was confronted by Major Heimpel with a statement from a traitor giving details of Brown's espionage activities, but Brown blamed it on some of the Jewish inmates, saying they were out to destroy the idea of a British Free Corps. The Germans believed him, but Heimpel still believed that he was a secret agent, and when the British Free Corps were disbanded Himmler ordered Brown's arrest. As the Allied forces entered Germany, Brown and a friend managed to kill an SS Colonel, steal his car and make contact with US Army forces. However, once back with British forces he found himself facing a charge of aiding the enemy. Word of his secret work for the Allies soon came from London, and he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal in recognition of his achievements. After the war he was the chief prosecution witness at 20 treason trials. Later life He wrote of his wartime exploits in a book, In Durance Vile (Hale 1981), concluding \\"...I was only able to do what I did because of my Christian belief which sustained me in my durance vile through not only the danger, but the hopeless dreariness of prisoner-of-war life\\". Brown's story is recounted from the perspective of Reg Beattie, one of the members of his team, in the book about Reg's POW diary entitled \\"Captive Plans\\". After working as a businessman in Newcastle, he moved to Dorset, where he died in 1964. External links *Distinguished Conduct Medal - * Bibliography  Sean Murphy.

It is a colorless oil that is sensitive to oxygen, becoming colored upon standing. The ketone was identified in 1943 by Sebe as the main component of the essential oil of Perilla frutescens. Perilla ketone is present in the leaves and seeds of purple mint (Perilla frutescens), which is toxic to some animals.Perilla: Botany, Uses and Genetic Resources When cattle and horses consume purple mint when grazing in fields in which it grows, the perilla ketone causes pulmonary edema leading to a condition sometimes called perilla mint toxicosis.  Synthesis  Perilla ketone was synthesized in 1957 by Matsuura from 3-furoyl chloride and an organocadmium compound similar to the Gilman reagent made from an isoamyl Grignard reagent and cadmium chloride. Perilla ketone (3-Furyl isoamyl ketone) has been prepared in 74% yield via the Stille reaction from a 3-furyl-organotin compound and isocaproyl chloride in tetrahydrofuran solvent.

It was the first purpose-built mosque in Sydney and is located at 71-75 Wangee Road, Lakemba. Owned and managed by the Lebanese Muslim Association (LMA), Lakemba Mosque and the LMA offices are situated contiguously at the same address. History A small house on the current site of Lakemba Mosque was purchased and used by the Lebanese Muslim Association from the 1960s as a place of worship. The house was demolished in the early 1970s and construction of the current building commenced. Construction lasted five years, with the mosque being completed in 1977.The Lebanese Muslims Association: Sheikhs retrieved 2007-01-26 The opening of the mosque was attended by the former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. Fundraising for the mosque took place both locally and internationally, with about half the funds coming from the Middle East and the largest single donation coming from the Saudi royal family. Lakemba Mosque was the second purpose-built mosque in Sydney and remains arguably Australia's most well-known and important mosque. While historically Muslims of Lebanese heritage constituted the majority of the congregation, today people of Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Somali and South-East Asian backgrounds are also of significant numbers, along with a small but growing number of converts. The overwhelming majority of the congregation is either of Hanafi or Shafi'i background. In February 2009, a Sydney Morning Herald journalist was ejected from the Lakemba mosque and the newspaper later reported that Anwar al-Awlaki spoke via phone link. A director of the mosque said that Shady Alsuleiman was in charge of organising evening youth events at the time of the sermon. Since 2014, the mosque has served as the centre of the National Mosque Open Day event. In late 2012 Shaykh Safi told the congregation, during prayers, that they should not take part in anything to do with Christmas. A fatwa warned that, \\"disbelievers are trying to draw Muslims away from the straight path\\". The Grand Mufti of Australia, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, said these views did not represent the majority of Muslims in Australia. Keysar Trad, former director and president of the LMA, said they previously greeted people with merry Christmas, \\"I don't know what has changed.\\" In March 2015, adjunct professor Clive Williams at Macquarie University's Centre for Policing, Intelligence & Counter Terrorism wrote that Sunni Muslims did not welcome Shia Muslims at the mosque. Mosque personnel Lakemba Mosque has a number of staff who assist in the running and maintenance of the mosque. Currently the mosque has three official Imams: *The Imam of Lakemba Mosque is Shaykh Yahya Safi, who worked as an Imam in Lebanon before his appointment at the Lakemba Mosque in 1996.Shaykh Yahya Safi Biography retrieved 2007-02-02 Shaykh Yahya gives the khutbah every fortnight, unless there is a visiting Shaykh from overseas. *The assistant Imam as of 2016 is Shaykh Mohammed Gomaa from Egypt. Shaykh Gomaa is a bilingual Imam who was trained at Egypt's prestigious Al-Azhar University. He specialises in Qur'anic Commentary and alternates in giving the Friday sermon each fortnight. *The deputy assistant Imam, as of 2015, is Shaykh Mohamed Harby. Shaykh Mohamed is a qƒÅri æ from Egypt who specialises in the sciences of Qur'an which he teaches at an advanced level to students at the Lebanese Muslim Association. Due its influence and significance, the mosque regularly hosts and is a first stop for visiting Islamic scholars from overseas. Activities The mosque offers a number of religious classes, such as in Prophetic biography, Fiqh and Aqidah. The mosque gives a platform to a number of local Shaykhs to speak and teach, such as Shaykh Wesam Charkawi. Several thousand worshippers normally attend weekly prayers on Fridays. In 2015 around 30,000 worshippers attended Eid prayers at the mosque and in the road outside, making it one of Australia's largest eid celebrations. In 2016, an estimated 40,000-50,000 attended Eid prayers.

It was originally one of three channels along with Prem1ere and The Children's Channel, that formed Thorn EMI's venture into satellite television, as a British version of music channel MTV. Music Box later became part of Virgin Vision, one of Richard Branson's business ventures launched in 1983.  History  As a 24-hour TV channel in the 1980s, Music Box was able to reach 60 million potential viewers in Europe and the Middle East thanks to satellite distribution. At the time, a satellite dish and receiver were very expensive and for this reason the channel had better viewing figures in countries where cable television was already used, such as Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. A special Italian version of Music Box was created in spring of 1988. Some Music Box shows were also retransmitted by Japanese broadcaster NHK. On 9 August 1986, the Yorkshire Television region of the UK's ITV decided to go 24 hours a day, but little cash was invested in that service, and so much of the downtime was filled with a rebroadcast of Music Box. It was the first time that an ITV company regularly broadcast 24 hours. Music Box was originally based in the heart of London, in a building where Virgin Vision and Super Channel were also based, and later gave home to the London offices of CNN International and Cartoon Network. The address during the satellite years was 19-21 Rathbone Place, London. On 30 January 1987 Super Channel was launched on the same satellite frequency previously used by Music Box on pan-European satellite Eutelsat 1-F1 located at 13¬∞ east, replaced during 1987 by Eutelsat 1-F4. For this reason Music Box stopped being a 24-hour TV channel, and Virgin set up Music Box as an independent producer of music programmes, continuing to broadcast its shows until the end of September 1987 for 10 hours a day on Super Channel. From October 1987 until January 1990 it was reduced from 10 hours a day to just a couple of hours a day of music programmes to be produced for Super Channel, with a two-month-long break in late 1988 due to problems related to the sale of Super Channel. Music Box ended its satellite broadcasts in January 1990 with the last pan-European showing of The Power Hour. The creator of the three satellite channels, as director of programmes, was Julian Mounter, who joined Music Box from Thames Television. Recognising that income for satellite television would be slow in coming, Mounter set about negotiating revolutionary union deals to enable the use of smaller crews in the studio and on location. He commandeered a boardroom at the HQ of Thorn EMI as one of the studios and a small basement on Shaftesbury Avenue, and it was there that many of the programmes were made before better facilities were found. The channels broke new ground in graphics, promotion and presentation, and set standards and practices still followed today. Mounter left in 1986 to become director general of Television New Zealand, and the three channels then took on individual senior management. Music Box as a satellite channel was said to have made a small contribution to the overthrow of eastern European communist regimes as, in its prime, it was illegally watched by young Europeans living in those countries using makeshift satellite systems. It gave many young people their first view of life in the rest of Europe. Directors on the channel included Rob Jones, who took over from Mounter as director of programmes, Geoffrey Davies, Rod Fairweather, John Leach, Les Harris, Ludo Graham, Simon Sanders and Siubhan Richmond. Carol McGiffin was part of the production team. After leaving satellite broadcasting, Music Box became a specialised producer of music shows for major British broadcasters and is now owned by Tinopolis, which also owns the firm Sunset + Vine, previously the owner of Music Box. The company's best-known programme of this period was the late night ITV show Forever which features pop videos and interview clips from stock footage.

Education He studied music at the University of Birmingham in England, first as an undergraduate (1981‚Äì84), then as a postgraduate studying composition with Jonty Harrison. It was during this time that he became one of the original members of BEAST, performing electroacoustic music throughout the United Kingdom under Harrison's direction. After gaining a PhD in 1992 he worked briefly in the Music department at the University of Surrey (England) (1992‚Äì93) before becoming lecturer at the Bangor University (Wales). He is currently a Professor of music there, as well as directing the work of the Electroacoustic Music Studios and Electroacoustic WALES, which performs electroacoustic and acousmatic music. Music Much of his acousmatic music displays an interest in the abstraction of unseen and unrecognisable sounds, an approach particularly strongly evident in earlier works such as Arrivals (1987) and Time and Fire (1991). However, with the composition of Scherzo (1992) a parallel concern with the anecdotal and pictorial possibilities of recognisable sounds began to emerge, and much of his subsequent work plays on the tensions between these two approaches. Since moving to Wales, much of the evocation of image in his music relates to the landscape of the area in which he lives and works. Ascent (1994) evokes the wildness of the mountain landscape of Snowdonia, which was awarded a ‚ÄòEuphonie d‚ÄôOr‚Äô by the Bourges electroacoustic music competition, as one of the most notable former prizewinning works between 1975 and 2005. More recently the cycle of works Four Anglesey Beaches (1999-2003) takes as its inspiration the seascapes and coastal locations of the area. Although very little music exists for conventional forces, there have been a few notable exceptions in recent years: Eclipse (orchestra, 2004) was premiered under Elgar Howarth in 2004, while in the same year Tempo Reale (string quartet, 2004) was chosen by Sir Peter Maxwell Davies for a performance in London's Wigmore Hall.

Mustafa Re≈üid Pa≈üa ordered the building a new record office in 1846.G√°bor √Ågoston, Bruce Masters, Prime Minister's Ottoman Archives, Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire, Facts On File, Inc. 2009] It was completed by architect Gaspare T. Fossati in 1848. The office of \\"Surveillance of Treasury of Documents\\" was formed and Muhsin Efendi was appointed as its manager. With the establishment of the Republic, the Hazine-i Evrak was transformed into Ba≈üvekalet Ar≈üiv Umum M√ºd√ºrl√ºƒü√º (The General Directorate of the Prime Ministry) and eventually the Ba≈übakanlƒ±k Ar≈üiv Genel M√ºd√ºrl√ºƒü√º. During this period, the records of various nineteenth- century Ottoman offices and administrative authorities were added to the collections. Concurrent with these changes and additions, Turkish scholars took the first steps to classify and catalog the various collections beginning in the 1910s. These early efforts produced a number of classified collections (tasnif) which are still cited according to the name of the scholar who created the catalog. Today the work of cataloging the vast collection continues.Christopher Markiewicz and Nir Shafir, ‚ÄúThe Ottoman State Archives‚Äù, Hazine, 10 October 2013 After more than a century in the center of the old city, the Ottoman archives were relocated in 2013 to the Kaƒüƒ±thane district of Istanbul.

It is five miles (8 km) north-east of Ivybridge and 14 miles (22 km) east-northeast of Plymouth.Air distance https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/UK_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=South%20Brent%2C%20United%20Kingdom&toplace;=Plymouth&dt1;=ChIJeeBezWvjbEgRvp27UHcA1ck&dt2;=ChIJPeqVDlONbEgRk4X1zrUsKDs History On the high moorlands are many hut circles, enclosures, and barrows, all dating from the Bronze Age. The manor of Brent belonged to Buckfast Abbey from the time of the foundation of the abbey in the early 11th century. It was bought at the Dissolution by Sir William Petre, a large receiver of monastic spoils in South Devon. South Brent was originally a woollen and market centre with two annual fairs. Brent Hill is the steep hill just outside the village from which it takes its name (Old English brant ‚Äì steep). On it are the ruins of an ancient building, supposed to have been a chapel, and of a windmill built about 1790. Amenities The village centre is within the boundaries of Dartmoor National Park. It is a thriving community with shops, pubs, businesses, primary school, village hall, sports ground and community centre. Hotel accommodation is provided by Glazebrook House South Brent primary school supports about 250 children. The buildings are modern and replace the old school which is now a community centre. Parish church The massive Norman tower of St Petroc‚Äôs Church (now at the west end) was apparently the central tower of a cruciform building. The west portion of the church was demolished, perhaps in the early 14th century, when the existing nave was rebuilt with two transepts. In the early 15th century these transepts were enlarged into aisles. The fine font of red sandstone is late 12th century and is similar in style to others in neighbouring churches. On the south of the churchyard is the manor house, part of which is 15th century. In 1436 the vicar, the Rev John Hay, was dragged out of the church and murdered while officiating at divine service. The door through which he was taken has been walled up, though the old doorway is just visible. Transport South Brent is next to the Devon Expressway which connects Exeter to the north-east and Plymouth to the west. Brent railway station was opened on the South Devon Railway on 15 June 1848. It served as the junction for the branch line to Kingsbridge from 19 December 1893. The station closed in 1964, though for some years there has been a movement to reopen it in order to reduce commuter traffic on the roads. The nearest railway station is Ivybridge railway station, which is 4.5 miles away. Sport and leisure The Palstone Park recreation ground is the home of the South Brent Football Club. It was founded as South Brent United in 1931. It is also the home of South Brent Judo Club formed in April 1974. Locals complain that South Brent experiences higher rainfall than surrounding towns and villages. It seems likely that the hills of Dartmoor do affect the microclimate of South Brent.

It is particularly used when solving singularly perturbed differential equations. It involves finding several different approximate solutions, each of which is valid (i.e. accurate) for part of the range of the independent variable, and then combining these different solutions together to give a single approximate solution that is valid for the whole range of values of the independent variable. In the Russian literature, these methods were known under the name of \\"intermediate asymptotics\\" and were introduced in the work of Yakov Zeldovich and Grigory Barenblatt. Method overview In a large class of singularly perturbed problems, the domain may be divided into two or more subdomains. In one of these, often the largest, the solution is accurately approximated by an asymptotic seriesR.B. Dingle (1973), Asymptotic Expansions: Their Derivation and Interpretation, Academic Press. found by treating the problem as a regular perturbation (i.e. by setting a relatively small parameter to zero). The other subdomains consist of one or more small areas in which that approximation is inaccurate, generally because the perturbation terms in the problem are not negligible there. These areas are referred to as transition layers, and as boundary or interior layers depending on whether they occur at the domain boundary (as is the usual case in applications) or inside the domain. An approximation in the form of an asymptotic series is obtained in the transition layer(s) by treating that part of the domain as a separate perturbation problem. This approximation is called the \\"inner solution,\\" and the other is the \\"outer solution,\\" named for their relationship to the transition layer(s). The outer and inner solutions are then combined through a process called \\"matching\\" in such a way that an approximate solution for the whole domain is obtained. A simple example Consider the boundary value problem : \\\\varepsilon y + (1+\\\\varepsilon) y' + y = 0, where y is a function of independent time variable t, which ranges from 0 to 1, the boundary conditions are y(0)=0 and y(1)=1, and \\\\varepsilon is a small parameter, such that 0<\\\\varepsilon\\\\ll 1. Outer solution, valid for t = O(1) Since \\\\varepsilon is very small, our first approach is to treat the equation as a regular perturbation problem, i.e. make the approximation \\\\varepsilon=0, and hence find the solution to the problem :y'+y=0.\\\\, Alternatively, consider that when y and t are both of size O(1), the four terms on the left hand side of the original equation are respectively of sizes O(\\\\varepsilon), O(1), O(\\\\varepsilon) and O(1). The leading-order balance on this timescale, valid in the distinguished limit \\\\varepsilon \\\\to 0, is therefore given by the second and fourth terms, i.e. y'+y=0.\\\\, This has solution :y=Ae^{-t}\\\\, for some constant A. Applying the boundary condition y(0) = 0, we would have A=0; applying the boundary condition y(1) = 1, we would have A=e. It is therefore impossible to satisfy both boundary conditions, so \\\\varepsilon=0 is not a valid approximation to make across the whole of the domain (i.e. this is a singular perturbation problem). From this we infer that there must be a boundary layer at one of the endpoints of the domain where \\\\varepsilon needs to be included. This region will be where \\\\varepsilon is no longer negligible compared to the independent variable t, i.e. t and \\\\varepsilon are of comparable size, i.e. the boundary layer is adjacent to t=0. Therefore, the other boundary condition y(1) = 1 applies in this outer region, so A=e, i.e. y_\\\\mathrm{O}=e^{1-t}\\\\, is an accurate approximate solution to the original boundary value problem in this outer region. It is the leading-order solution. Inner solution, valid for t = O(Œµ) In the inner region, t and \\\\varepsilon are both tiny, but of comparable size, so define the new O(1) time variable \\\\tau = t/\\\\varepsilon. Rescale the original boundary value problem by replacing t with \\\\tau\\\\varepsilon, and the problem becomes : \\\\frac{1}{\\\\varepsilon} y(\\\\tau ) + \\\\left( {1 + \\\\varepsilon } \\\\right)\\\\frac{1}{\\\\varepsilon }y'(\\\\tau ) + y(\\\\tau ) = 0,\\\\, which, after multiplying by \\\\varepsilon and taking \\\\varepsilon = 0, is :y + y' = 0. \\\\, Alternatively, consider that when t has reduced to size O(\\\\varepsilon), then y is still of size O(1) (using the expression for y_\\\\mathrm{O}), and so the four terms on the left hand side of the original equation are respectively of sizes O(\\\\varepsilon‚àí1), O(\\\\varepsilon‚àí1), O(1) and O(1). The leading-order balance on this timescale, valid in the distinguished limit \\\\varepsilon \\\\to 0, is therefore given by the first and second terms, i.e. y + y'=0.\\\\, This has solution :y=B-Ce^{-\\\\tau}\\\\, for some constants B and C. Since y(0)=0 applies in this inner region, this gives B=C, so an accurate approximate solution to the original boundary value problem in this inner region (it is the leading-order solution) is :y_\\\\mathrm{I} = B\\\\left( {1 - e^{ - \\\\tau } } \\\\right)= B\\\\left( {1 - e^{ - t/\\\\varepsilon } } \\\\right).\\\\, Matching We use matching to find the value of the constant B. The idea of matching is that the inner and outer solutions should agree for values of t in an intermediate (or overlap) region, i.e. where \\\\varepsilon \\\\ll t \\\\ll 1. We need the outer limit of the inner solution to match the inner limit of the outer solution, i.e. \\\\lim_{\\\\tau \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} y_\\\\mathrm{I} = \\\\lim_{t \\\\to 0} y_\\\\mathrm{O} ,\\\\, which gives B=e. Composite solution To obtain our final, matched, composite solution, valid on the whole domain, one popular method is the uniform method. In this method, we add the inner and outer approximations and subtract their overlapping value, \\\\,y_\\\\mathrm{overlap}, which would otherwise be counted twice. The overlapping value is the outer limit of the inner boundary layer solution, and the inner limit of the outer solution; these limits were above found to equal e. Therefore, the final approximate solution to this boundary value problem is, :y(t) = y_\\\\mathrm{I} + y_\\\\mathrm{O} - y_\\\\mathrm{overlap} = e\\\\left( {1 - e^{ - t/\\\\varepsilon } } \\\\right) + e^{1 - t} - e = e\\\\left( {e^{ - t} - e^{ - t/\\\\varepsilon } } \\\\right).\\\\, Note that this expression correctly reduces to the expressions for y_\\\\mathrm{I} and y_\\\\mathrm{O} when t is O(\\\\varepsilon) and O(1), respectively. Accuracy converge to the outer solution pointwise, but not uniformly, almost everywhere. This final solution satisfies the problem's original differential equation (shown by substituting it and its derivatives into the original equation). Also, the boundary conditions produced by this final solution match the values given in the problem, up to a constant multiple. This implies, due to the uniqueness of the solution, that the matched asymptotic solution is identical to the exact solution up to a constant multiple. This is not necessarily always the case, any remaining terms should go to zero uniformly as \\\\varepsilon \\\\rightarrow 0 . Not only does our solution successfully approximately solve the problem at hand, it closely approximates the problem's exact solution. It happens that this particular problem is easily found to have exact solution :y(t) = \\\\frac{{e^{ - t} - e^{ - t/\\\\varepsilon } }}{{e^{ - 1} - e^{ - 1/\\\\varepsilon } }},\\\\, which has the same form as the approximate solution, by the multiplying constant. The approximate solution is the first term in a binomial expansion of the exact solution in powers of e^{1 - 1/\\\\varepsilon }. Location of boundary layer Conveniently, we can see that the boundary layer, where y' and y are large, is near t=0, as we supposed earlier. If we had supposed it to be at the other endpoint and proceeded by making the rescaling \\\\tau = (1 - t)/\\\\varepsilon, we would have found it impossible to satisfy the resulting matching condition. For many problems, this kind of trial and error is the only way to determine the true location of the boundary layer. Harder problems The problem above is a simple example because it is a single equation with only one dependent variable, and there is one boundary layer in the solution. Harder problems may contain several co-dependent variables in a system of several equations, and/or with several boundary and/or interior layers in the solution. It is often desirable to find more terms in the asymptotic expansions of both the outer and the inner solutions. The appropriate form of these expansions is not always clear: while a power-series expansion in \\\\varepsilon may work, sometimes the appropriate form involves fractional powers of \\\\varepsilon, functions such as \\\\varepsilon \\\\log \\\\varepsilon, et cetera. As in the above example, we will obtain outer and inner expansions with some coefficients which must be determined by matching. Second-order differential equations Schr√∂dinger-like second-order differential equations A method of matched asymptotic expansions - with matching of solutions in the common domain of validity - has been developed and used extensively by Dingle and M√ºller-Kirsten for the derivation of asymptotic expansions of the solutions and characteristic numbers (band boundaries) of Schr√∂dinger-like second-order differential equations with periodic potentials - in particular for the Mathieu equationR.B.

Convection-diffusion equations Methods of matched asymptotic expansions have been developed to find approximate solutions to the Smoluchowski convection-diffusion equation, which is a singularly perturbed second-order differential equation. The problem has been studied particularly in the context of colloid particles in linear flow fields, where the variable is given by the pair distribution function around a test particle. In the limit of low P√©clet number, the convection-diffusion equation also presents a singularity at infinite distance (where normally the far-field boundary condition should be placed) due to the flow field being linear in the interparticle separation. This problem can be circumvented with a spatial Fourier transform as shown by Jan Dhont.An Introduction to the Dynamics of Colloids by J. K. G. Dhont, google books link A different approach to solving this problem was developed by Alessio Zaccone and coworkers and consists in placing the boundary condition right at the boundary layer distance, upon assuming (in a first-order approximation) a constant value of the pair distribution function in the outer layer due to convection being dominant there. This leads to an approximate theory for the encounter rate of two interacting colloid particles in a linear flow field in good agreement with the full numerical solution. When the P√©clet number is significantly larger than one, the singularity at infinite separation no longer occurs and the method of matched asymptotics can be applied to construct the full solution for the pair distribution function across the entire domain.

Biography Early years Grigg was the son of Henry Bridewell Grigg, a member of the Indian Civil Service, and Elizabeth Louisa, n√©e Thomson, the daughter of Edward Deas Thomson. Born in Madras, he was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford, where he won the Gaisford Prize for Greek verse in 1902. Upon graduation, he embarked on a career in journalism. He joined The Times in 1903 as secretary to the editor, George Earle Buckle, then moved to The Outlook in 1905, where he worked as assistant editor under J. L. Garvin. Grigg returned to The Times in 1906, where he was the head of the colonial department until he resigned in 1913 in order to become the co-editor of The Round Table Journal.Kenneth Rose, \\"Grigg, Edward William Macleay, first Baron Altrincham\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, H.C.G. Matthew and Brian Harrison, eds. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), vol. 24, p. 1. Military service At the start of the First World War, Grigg enlisted in the Grenadier Guards, and was commissioned as a special-reserve second lieutenant (on probation) on 13 March 1915. He was confirmed in his rank on 11 August, with a promotion to temporary lieutenant. He was subsequently promoted to lieutenant (effective 15 July 1915), and to temporary captain on 8 November. Serving in France, he distinguished himself in combat before his transfer to the staff as a GSO 3 on 4 February 1916, briefly relinquishing his temporary rank of captain with effect from 27 January, and resuming it from 15 April. He received the Military Cross in 1917 and the Distinguished Service Order the following year, and was a lieutenant-colonel by the end of the war, becoming the only civilian (non-regular officer) to become GSO 1 of a division during the war.Simon Robbins, British Generalship on the Western Front 1914-18: Defeat Into Victory, page 43. Grigg was created Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1919 and served as military secretary to Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) from 1919 until 1920, accompanying the prince on tours of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. For his services, Grigg was appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1919 and Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1920. Entry into politics Upon his return in 1920, Grigg became a private secretary to Prime Minister David Lloyd George. Grigg became devoted to Lloyd George, developing a deep respect for the \\"Welsh Wizard\\" that subsequently limited his political career. After Lloyd George's departure in 1922, Grigg passed up a number of appointments within the civil service to enter the House of Commons. He was elected to Parliament as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) in 1922 from the constituency of Oldham. During this period he also served as secretary to the Rhodes Trust, a position he held from 1923 until 1925. In 1923, Grigg married Hon. Joan Dickson-Poynder, daughter of his fellow politician Lord Islington. They had three children: * John Edward Poynder Grigg, 2nd Baron Altrincham (15 April 1924 ‚Äì 31 December 2001), a journalist and author * Hon.

Governor of Kenya In 1925, Grigg resigned his seat to accept an appointment as governor of Kenya. While frustrated in his assigned task to merge Kenya with the bordering British colonies of Uganda and Tanganyika, he provided energetic administration to the colony, improving agriculture, education, and infrastructure during his governorship. Yet Grigg opposed consideration of the colony's development into a multi-racial state, believing that the native African population was ill-prepared for managing the government. During this period he was named KCMG in 1928.Kenneth Rose, \\"Grigg, Edward William Macleay, first Baron Altrincham\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, H.C.G.

Though offered his choice of Indian governorships, his poor health, along with that of his wife, forestalled accepting an appointment. Instead, Grigg decided to reenter politics. Though initially nominated as the Conservative candidate for the Leeds Central constituency in the 1931 general election, Grigg loyally stood aside for the National Labour candidate, Richard Denman. Two years later, he returned to Parliament in a by- election for the constituency of Altrincham. He would serve as MP for Altrincham until the constituency was abolished in 1945. Grigg's return to politics coincided with the rise to power of Adolf Hitler as German chancellor. Grigg feared the Nazi movement and in two books he pressed the case for a strong defence against the threat it posed. Yet Grigg never openly challenged the policy of appeasement advanced by the governments of Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain, keeping his criticisms private. When war did break out, Grigg joined the government as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Information. In April 1940 he became first the financial secretary, then joint parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War, a post he held until March 1942. He declined Winston Churchill's invitation to become First Commissioner of Works, as it was dependent upon acceptance of a peerage, and did not return to government until 21 November 1944 when he was selected as Minister-Resident for the Middle East as successor to Lord Moyne who was assassinated two weeks earlier. Grigg was also appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1944. Final years In the aftermath of the Conservative caretaker government's defeat in the 1945 general election, Grigg was raised to the peerage as Baron Altrincham, ending his political career. Three years later, he assumed the editorship of the National Review, a post he held until failing health forced his retirement in 1954. Grigg died a year later in Gloucestershire aged 76. His son, John Grigg, who became the second Baron Altrincham upon his father's death, disclaimed the peerage in 1963 under the terms of the Peerage Act of that year.

As tsukkomi, Red is easily embarrassed and blushes quickly, which is where he gets the name. At the end of every episode of Uchimura Produce, the host, Teruyoshi Uchimura would shout, \\"And today's Red is...\\" to which Red would insert some strange (often embarrassingly un-funny) pseudo-English or meaningless Japanese phrase. Occasionally Red was given his own corner, \\"Red's World\\" (a play on Summers' ≈åtake's \\"≈åtake World\\") in which he would perform weird and nonsensical ad libs (e.g. \\"Ariga-ton, ton, Washington!\\" and \\"Pan!

The series stars T√©a Leoni and Holland Taylor. The show took place at the office of a tabloid news publication. Plot Pulitzer Prize nominated photographer Nora Wilde (T√©a Leoni) divorces her rich, philandering husband Leland Banks, asking for nothing in the settlement except the use of her maiden name. Broke and without prospects for employment, after Leland blackballs her from respectable mainstream work, Nora seeks work at The Comet, a sleazy celebrity tabloid owned by Sir Rudolph Halley (Tim Curry) and run by ruthless Camilla Dane (Holland Taylor). Initially, Nora is repulsed by the depths to which she has to sink for her new job ‚Äì she finds herself in demeaning situations such as stealing Anna Nicole Smith's urine to run a pregnancy test, and staking out the sewer for mutant alligators ‚Äì but before long, she begins to feel at home. Nora's coworkers include egotistical Nicky Columbus (Jonathan Penner), a potential love interest; T.J. (Darryl Sivad), a humorless African-American man always clad in dark sunglasses; and Stupid Dave (Mark Roberts) who is mentally handicapped. At home, Nora deals with deranged building manager Mr. Donner (Jack Blessing) and Chloe Banks (Amy Ryan), her best friend and former step-daughter. In the second season, the show switched networks and was retooled. Meat-mogul Les Polanski (George Wendt) buys The Comet, intending to make it a respectable publication. Gone were the outlandishly zany antics from the first season, and Stupid Dave was now merely referred to as Dave. Chloe disappears without explanation, as does Mr. Donner (since Nora has a new apartment). Mary Tyler Moore (replacing Dyan Cannon from season one) and George Segal both make frequent guest appearances as Nora's parents in season two, eventually moving into the apartment across the hall. Most episodes centered on Nora's romantic life and how her job could intrude on that. Season three saw enormous changes. Camilla quits The Comet and moves on to rival tabloid The National Inquisitor, leaving most of the staff behind. By this point, she and Nora had become close, so she asks Nora to join her at the Inquisitor. Also moving to The Inquisitor was Dave, who was no longer mentally handicapped.

In Pennsylvania, US 30 runs along or near the transcontinental Lincoln Highway, which ran from San Francisco, California to New York City before the U.S. Routes were designated. (However, the Lincoln Highway turned northeast at Philadelphia, using present US 1 and its former alignments to cross the Delaware River into Trenton, New Jersey.) Popular places along the route include the Gettysburg Battlefield, Dutch Wonderland, the Flight 93 National Memorial, Fort Ligonier, Westmoreland Mall, Jennerstown Speedway, Idlewild and Soak Zone, and Independence Mall of Independence National Historical Park. Route description West Virginia to Pittsburgh US 30 presently crosses from West Virginia into Pennsylvania near Chester, West Virginia. It is a surface road from West Virginia to the U.S. Route 22 junction southeast of Imperial. There it joins the US 22 freeway, and then US 22/30 joins the Penn-Lincoln Parkway West (now part of extended Interstate 376) into downtown Pittsburgh. Westbound US 30 on the Penn-Lincoln Parkway (also I-376 and US 22) in Pittsburgh US 30 currently passes through Pittsburgh on the Penn-Lincoln Parkway, crossing the Monongahela River on the Fort Pitt Bridge. This freeway was built from 1953 to 1962 as a bypass for both the Lincoln Highway and the William Penn Highway (U.S. Route 22). Besides US 30, it also carries US 22 and Interstate 376. At a point beyond the Squirrel Hill Tunnel, at the southern end of PA Route 8, US 30 leaves the Parkway (which continues as I-376/US 22 to Monroeville). Pittsburgh to Lancaster Much of this section of U.S. 30 (and the Lincoln Highway) has been supplanted by the Pennsylvania Turnpike (which is Interstate 76 between the Ohio border and the Valley Forge interchange). From the Pittsburgh area, US 30 heads east through Greensburg, where it intersects U.S. Route 119. It then heads into Somerset County, where it meets U.S. Route 219 east of Jennerstown. U.S. Route 30 / the Lincoln Highway forms the border between Stonycreek & Shade Townships. On September 11, 2001, United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in an empty field approximately two miles (3 km) south of U.S. 30, in Stonycreek Township. The heroism of the passengers and crew apparently thwarted the hijackers' plan to crash into either the US Capitol Building or the White House in Washington D.C.. The entrance to the permanent Flight 93 National Memorial is along U.S. 30. The highway then runs through Buckstown & Reels Corner, intersecting with Pennsylvania Route 160 in Reels Corner. U.S. Route 30 then passes through the extreme northern tip of Allegheny Township as it exits Somerset County. West Providence Township, Bedford County The route continues east into Bedford County, where it heads toward Bedford, the site of the route's intersection with U.S. Route 220 a short distance south of the southern beginning of Interstate 99 at the Pennsylvania Turnpike interchange. Past Bedford, the route is four-laned and closely follows the Pennsylvania Turnpike, passing through Everett. It then passes through the town of Breezewood, Pennsylvania, where Interstate 70 traffic must still use a short non-interstate section of U.S. 30 to go between the turnpike (which is I-70/76 to the west of Breezewood and to the east of New Stanton) and I-70 going to Maryland. The route then narrows back to two lanes climbs through the Allegheny Mountains as it passes through Fulton County, intersecting U.S. Route 522 in McConnellsburg. It then enters the agricultural Cumberland Valley in Franklin County, where it passes through Chambersburg, crossing U.S. Route 11 and Interstate 81. The highway then crosses the South Mountain range through the Cashtown Gap and enters Adams County. West of Gettysburg, U.S. 30 follows much of the path of the old Chambersburg Turnpike (from Gettysburg to Cashtown), a route used by much of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia during the Gettysburg Campaign. The route serves as the main east-west artery through Gettysburg, traversing the northwestern portion of the Gettysburg Battlefield and also intersecting U.S. Route 15. Past Gettysburg, Route 30 travels through Guldens and New Oxford before entering York County. Just west of York, Route 30 branches off Lincoln Highway (which here picks up at the start of PA 462) to bypass the downtown parts of the cities of York and Lancaster; it is briefly a freeway but then, continuing as 4-lane highway, reaches grade-level intersections in York. Several modifications to improve flow have been made in York but the route is still congested due to a series of traffic signals. It then becomes freeway again, and crosses the Susquehanna River on the Wright's Ferry Bridge into Lancaster County. Along the north side of Lancaster, US 30 intersects the eastern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 283, which heads to Harrisburg, and then shares a brief concurrency with U.S. Route 222. From 1997 to 2004 significant work was completed to the bypass around Lancaster. Just east of Lancaster, the freeway ends at the eastern end of PA 462; U.S. 30 goes back onto Lincoln Highway and continues on its way toward Philadelphia. Lancaster to New Jersey US 30 westbound in East Lampeter Township to the east of LancasterU.S. 30 follows the route of the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike, the first long-distance, paved road built in the United States, between Lancaster and Philadelphia. Between the east end of the bypass around York and Lancaster and the west end of the Coatesville Downingtown Bypass in Chester County, there is a large freeway gap between these two segments that is frequently congested. PennDOT is under study to improve this last remaining section. This section passes through Pennsylvania Dutch Country and is lined with many Amish tourist attractions. Between Sadsbury Township and East Whiteland Township, US 30 follows the limited-access Coatesville Downingtown Bypass and Exton Bypass with U.S. Route 30 Business running along the former alignment through Coatesville, Downingtown, and Exton. Along the bypass, US 30 intersects U.S. Route 322 near Downingtown. At the east end of the bypass, it intersects U.S. Route 202 and heads east on Lancaster Avenue. The Exton Bypass portion of US 30 is designated the Exton Bypass Scenic Byway, a Pennsylvania Scenic Byway. Westbound US 30 past PA 252 in PaoliIt then heads through the Main Line suburbs of Philadelphia, so named as they were located along the Pennsylvania Railroad Main Line, which is now Amtrak's Keystone Corridor carrying Amtrak and SEPTA's Paoli/Thorndale Line trains. Within this area, the route passes through northern Delaware County, intersects with Interstate 476 and passes through Villanova University in Radnor Township, then crosses into Montgomery County in Lower Merion Township (except for a few hundred yards where the road briefly re-enters Delaware County in Haverford Township) before entering Philadelphia in Philadelphia County. I-676) in Philadelphia US 30 then crosses U.S. Route 1 (City Avenue) into Philadelphia. In the city, it makes a left turn onto Girard Avenue and meets U.S. Route 13 and Interstate 76 (Schuylkill Expressway) near the Philadelphia Zoo. US 30 then follows I-76 east and Interstate 676 (Vine Street Expressway) through Center City to the Ben Franklin Bridge, which carries I-676 and US 30 over the Delaware River into New Jersey. History The path of the Lincoln Highway was first laid out in September 1913; it was defined to run through Canton, Ohio, Beaver, Pittsburgh, Greensburg, Ligonier, Bedford, Chambersburg, Gettysburg, York, Lancaster and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Camden, New Jersey.Lincoln Highway Association, Proclamation of the Route of the Lincoln Highway, September 14, 1913 This bypassed Harrisburg to the south, and thus did not use the older main route across the state between Chambersburg and Lancaster. From Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, this incorporated a number of old turnpikes, some of which still collected tolls:Brian Butko, The Lincoln Highway: Pennsylvania Traveler's Guide, * Pittsburgh and Greensburg Turnpike, Pittsburgh to Greensburg * Stoystown and Greensburg Turnpike, Greensburg to Stoystown * Bedford and Stoystown Turnpike, Stoystown to Bedford * Chambersburg and Bedford Turnpike, Bedford to Chambersburg * Chambersburg and Gettysburg Turnpike, Chambersburg to Gettysburg * York and Gettysburg Turnpike, Gettysburg to York * Wrightsville Turnpike, York to Wrightsville * Columbia- Wrightsville Bridge, Wrightsville to Columbia * Lancaster and Columbia Turnpike, Columbia to Lancaster * Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike, Lancaster to Philadelphia This original 1913 path of the Lincoln Highway continued east from Philadelphia, crossing the Delaware River to Camden, New Jersey on the Market Street Ferry. The city of Philadelphia marked the route from the ferry landing west on Market Street through downtown and onto Lancaster Avenue to the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike in early 1914.How \\"Lincoln Way\\" Project Now Stands, New York Times April 5, 1914 By 1915 Camden was dropped from the route, allowing the highway to cross the Delaware on a bridge at Trenton (initially the Calhoun Street Bridge, later the Bridge Street Bridge). In 1924, the entire Lincoln Highway in Pennsylvania was designated Pennsylvania Route 1. In late 1926 the route from West Virginia to Philadelphia (using the new route west of Pittsburgh) was assigned US 30, while the rest of the Lincoln Highway and PA 1 became part of U.S. Route 1. The PA 1 designation was gone by 1929, but several branches from east to west - PA Route 101, PA Route 201, PA Route 301, PA Route 401, PA Route 501 and PA Route 601 - had been assigned by then. (PA Route 701 was assigned later as a branch of PA 101.) Ohio to Downtown Pittsburgh As defined in 1913, the Lincoln Highway ran east-northeast from Canton, Ohio to Alliance and east via Salem, crossing into Pennsylvania just east of East Palestine. From there it continued southeasterly to Beaver, crossing the Beaver River there and heading south along its left bank to Rochester and the Ohio River's right bank to Pittsburgh. By 1915, the highway had been realigned to the route it would follow until the end of 1927. It ran east from Canton, Ohio to Lisbon and then southeast to East Liverpool on the Ohio River. After crossing into Pennsylvania, it turned north away from the river at Smiths Ferry, taking an inland route to Beaver, where it rejoined the Ohio River. It crossed the Beaver River into Rochester, joining the 1913 alignment, and turned south with the Ohio to Pittsburgh. =1915 route= This route entered Pennsylvania along PA Route 68. After crossing Little Beaver Creek, it turned south on Main Street, passing under the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad (PRR) into Glasgow. After passing through that community on Liberty Street, the highway turned north and passed under the railroad again at Smiths Ferry, merging with Smiths Ferry Road. This alignment through Glasgow carried the Lincoln Highway until ca. 1926, when the present PA 68 was built on the north side of the railroad.National Bridge Inventory The Lincoln Highway left the banks of the Ohio River on Smiths Ferry Road, which includes an old stone bridge over Upper Dry Run. It turned east on Tuscarawas Road through Ohioville, entering Beaver on Fourth Street and turning south on Buffalo Street to reach Third Street (PA Route 68). By 1929 this inland Glasgow-Beaver route was numbered PA Route 168, while the route along the river, never followed by the Lincoln Highway, was PA 68. Where PA 68 crosses the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad from Beaver into Bridgewater along Third Street and then the Beaver River on the ca. 1963 Rochester-Bridgewater Bridge, the Lincoln Highway instead ran along Bridge Street, just to the north, and crossed the Old Rochester-Bridgewater Bridge into Rochester. Continuing through Rochester to Pittsburgh, the Lincoln Highway left the Old Rochester-Bridgewater Bridge on Madison Street, turning onto Brighton Avenue, and then crossing the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway (PRR) on New York Avenue. After running alongside the Ohio River on Railroad Avenue, the highway crossed the railroad again in Freedom (about a block north of Third Street), running through Freedom on Third Avenue. South of downtown Freedom, Third Avenue merges into the Ohio River Boulevard, also known as PA Route 65, which runs along the old Lincoln Highway into Conway. There the old highway went onto First Avenue and State Street, rejoining PA 65 in Baden. Further into Baden, the old highway left PA 65 again, onto State Street, becoming Duss Avenue in Harmony Township. At the Ambridge limits, this becomes PA Route 989, but the old highway turned west at 14th Street and then south on Merchant Street. Crossing Big Sewickley Creek from Ambridge, Beaver County into Leetsdale, Allegheny County, Merchant Street becomes Beaver Street, a brick road. Beaver Road and Beaver Street continues through Edgeworth, Sewickley, and Osborne, merging back into PA 65 at the border with Haysville. Sewickley officially changed the name of its piece to Lincoln Highway by an ordinance in January 1916, and Osborne, Edgeworth and Leetsdale soon followed suit, but that name is no longer used. In Glenfield, the highway crossed the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway twice, once near the present overpass and again west of Toms Run Road. The old road next to the Ohio River, Beaver Street, is still a yellow brick road but now used only by local traffic. The old road left PA 65 again in Emsworth as Beaver Road, becoming Brighton Road in Ben Avon before re-merging with PA 65. It splits yet again, also in Ben Avon, onto Brighton Road, another yellow brick road. In Avalon it is California Avenue, and in Bellevue it is Lincoln Avenue, coincidentally named after Lincoln soon after the U.S. Civil War.Bridges and Tunnels of Allegheny County and Pittsburgh, PA, California Av over Jacks Run The highway crosses into Pittsburgh on a high concrete arch bridge over Jack's Run, built in 1924 to replace an earlier bridge built for a streetcar line, and returns to the California Avenue name. It crosses Woods Run on a similar 1928 bridge next to a newer bridge built for the Ohio River Boulevard (PA Route 65).Bridges and Tunnels of Allegheny County and Pittsburgh, PA, California Av over Woods Run Where California Avenue curves away from PA 65, the Lincoln Highway continued next to it on Chateau Street, turning east on Western Avenue and then south on Galveston Avenue onto the 1915 Manchester Bridge to the Point. During the time that the Lincoln Highway ran through Rochester, the Rochester-Pittsburgh segment was locally maintained. It was often foggy, and a July 1926 Lincoln Highway Association road report states that it was \\"paved city streets, mostly poor\\", in stark contrast to the good paving east of Pittsburgh. By 1924, reports recommended following an alternate on the other side of the river between Rochester and Pittsburgh. The route west of Rochester had similar problems; it was a dirt road, despite being a state highway.1911 state map By 1922 an official detour was recommended via East Palestine, Ohio and Beaver, largely identical to the initial 1913 plan. =1927 route= Work began in the mid-1920s on a new route to the south of the existing route, passing through West Virginia and bypassing the problematic sections on both sides of Rochester; the Lincoln Highway was moved to it December 2, 1927. This new route had already been numbered U.S. 30 in late 1926. The new Lincoln Highway bypassed the community of Imperial on a bypass built for it. Just southeast of Imperial, the highway turned east on Steubenville Pike, joining what was U.S. Route 22 before the present U.S. 22/U.S. 30 freeway was built ca. 1964. Steubenville Pike runs along the north side of the freeway, crossing to the south side and then merging with it just west of the I-376 interchange. From the late 1940s to 1982, the appropriately- named Penn-Lincoln Drive-In Theater operated on a stretch of the original Lincoln Highway in North Fayette, just east of Imperial. It reopened for one season in 1985 as the Super 30 West Drive-In. The site is now occupied by Penn-Lincoln Shopping Center. US 22 and US 30 now join I-376 and turn southeast, but the Lincoln Highway (and US 22/30 before the nearby part of what is now I-376 opened in 1953) continued east with PA 60 through Robinson Township. In 1950, the Twin Hi-Way Drive-In Theater opened along the Robinson Township stretch, its name derived from the road's former designation of dual U.S. Route 22/30. Through Crafton, the highway used Steuben Street, Noble Avenue, Dinsmore Avenue, and Crafton Boulevard, now northbound PA 60. In Pittsburgh, the highway ran along Crafton Boulevard, Noblestown Road, and South Main Street, as PA 60 still does. It turned onto Carson Street (now PA Route 837) at the West End Circle, crossing the 1927 Point Bridge into the Point. Downtown Pittsburgh to North Huntingdon Marker for Lincoln Highway along US 30 westbound at PA 655 in Licking Creek Township From 1915 to late 1927, the Lincoln Highway crossed the Allegheny River on the Manchester Bridge to the Point, touching down at the foot of Penn Avenue after meeting the Point Bridge.1923 plat map, Central Pittsburgh It made its way through downtown to Bigelow Boulevard (now PA Route 380), using Water Street, Liberty Avenue and Oliver Avenue. It continued to follow present PA 380 onto Craig Street and Baum Boulevard to East Liberty. The highway left East Liberty and Pittsburgh on Penn Avenue, the old Pittsburgh and Greensburg Turnpike, also now part of PA 380, and further east part of PA Route 8. (PA 380 however bypasses the center of East Liberty.) The Boulevard of the Allies opened east from downtown Pittsburgh in 1923, and in 1924 it was designated as an alternate route.Lincoln Highway Resource Guide, Appendix A - Lincoln Highway Chronology By 1930, this bypass ran along the Boulevard of the Allies, Forbes Avenue, Beeler Street, Wilkins Avenue and Dallas Avenue, rejoining the Lincoln Highway at Penn Avenue, west of Wilkinsburg.1930 Pennsylvania Transportation Map, back side Leaving the Pittsburgh area, the Lincoln Highway turned onto Ardmore Boulevard (now signed as PA 8 north of I-376, and U.S. 30 south of I-376). It then branched away from Ardmore Boulevard along Electric Avenue, turned northeast on Braddock Avenue, then east on Penn Avenue. The Lincoln Highway originally continued onto Airbrake Avenue and then turned south at 11th Street to cross Turtle Creek and the Pennsylvania Railroad main line over a bridge; a 1925 replacement bridge starts at the intersection of Airbrake Avenue, Penn Avenue, Monroeville Avenue, and Greensburg Pike.Bridges and Tunnels of Allegheny County and Pittsburgh, PA, Greensburg Pike over Turtle Creek The Lincoln Highway then followed Greensburg Pike up to current U.S. 30. In 1932, a bypass of the grades into and out of Turtle Creek, including the George Westinghouse Bridge, was opened. It runs along current U.S. 30 from the interchange with Electric Avenue in Chalfant to the intersection with Greensburg Pike in North Versailles. The borough of White Oak had named their main street Lincoln Way in an attempt to convince the Lincoln Highway Association to use it,Bridges and Tunnels of Allegheny County and Pittsburgh, PA, Field Notes: \\"Mosside Bridge, the Great Valley and PA48\\" but instead the highway continued along Greensburg Pike through North Versailles. Recent developments A bypass of the section of US 30 in Gap, in Lancaster County, was first proposed in February 2012. In 2015, a PennDOT project began to build a bypass to the north of Gap for westbound US 30 between the PA 772 and PA 41 intersections to improve traffic flow and safety at the congested intersection of US 30 and PA 41. The bypass, which cost $10 million, was opened on August 4, 2016. On April 7, 2018, a section of US 30 in East Pittsburgh sank down a hill after a landslide. One apartment building was destroyed, another threatened and ultimately demolished. The damaged road section reopened in late June 2018.

Also known by a native name, yarri, it is described as being a dog-sized feline with stripes and a long tail, prominent front teeth and a savage temperament. It has been hypothesized to be a survivor or descendant of the large predatory marsupial Thylacoleo, officially considered to be extinct, or possibly a large feral cat variant (given possible discrepancies with thylacoleo dentition). In 1926 A. S. le Souef described a \\"Striped marsupial cat\\" in The Wild Animals of Australasia, this information later also included in Furred Animals of Australia, by Ellis Troughton, longtime curator of mammals in the Australian Museum. History The earliest documented witness reports of a Queensland marsupial tiger date from 1871, with indigenous traditions of the yarri preceding these. Lumholtz writes in 1878, I learned that on the summit of the Coast Mountains, before mentioned, there lived two varieties of mammals which seemed to me to be unknown to science: but I had much difficulty in acquiring this knowledge. One of the animals [the local Aborigines] called yarri. From their description I conceived it to be a marsupial tiger. It was said to be about the size of a dingo, though its legs were shorter and its tail long, and it was described ... as being very savage. If pursued it climbed up the trees, where the natives did not dare follow it, and by gestures they explained to me how at such times it would growl and bite their hands. Rocky retreats were its most favourite habitat, and its principal food was said to be in a little brown variety of wallaby common in Northern Queensland scrubs. Its flesh was not particularly appreciated ... and if they accidentally killed a yarri they gave it to their old women. In Western Queensland I heard much about an animal which seemed to me to be identical with the yarri here described, and a specimen was once nearly shot by an officer of the black police in the regions I was now visiting [Herbert River]. Lumholtz goes on to contrast the description of this animal with a leaf-eating species recognisable as a tree kangaroo, possibly that now known as Lumholtz's, after the author's work in scientific appraisal of these and other species of the region. Reports have come consistently from the Northeast of Queensland, and indicate a fast and agile creature (Welfare & Fairley, 1981). Though these have diminished in number since the 1950s, they have continued (the Beast of Buderim being one recent example of the phenomenon). Such sightings in modern context, when able to be investigated further, have been universally identified as introduced domestic cats gone feral -- natural selection tends favour proportions, markings and behaviours more commonly associated with actual wild species, after only a few generations in the wild.. The domestic cat was introduced to Australia some hundreds of years ago, and have dispersed (and been dispersed) nationally, with only some islands remaining free from the declared pest. Thylacoleo, an animal of similar size and predatory habits, did live in Australia as recently as the late Pleistocene period, perhaps coexisting with the very first humans that arrived at Australia who were the ancestors of modern Australian Aboriginals. However, scientists estimate that Thylacoleo became extinct 30,000 years ago. Modern sightings of an animal described as remarkably like Thylacoleo have led some researchers to speculate that a small relict population has somehow survived in remote areas. Cryptozoologists who promote the theory of survival of the Tasmanian tiger or thylacine Thylacinus cynocephalus, a Thylacinid, and also currently accepted as extinct, favour proposed survival of the Queensland tiger. The fundamental difference between the two cases, however, is that the last Tasmanian tiger in captivity died in 1936, and the species was not officially declared as extinct until 1986. This makes the prospect of species survival of the thylacine more likely than that of Thylacoleo. Thylacine or Thylacoleo? In his 1965 revision of the book Furred Animals of Australia, Ellis Troughton proposed that the Queensland tiger was merely a mainland variant of the thylacine. When discussing sightings of the Queensland tiger or animals thought to be the Queensland tiger, people sometimes refer to them as thylacines, though there are distinct and consistent differences in the descriptions of the animals (i.e.: head shape, position and colour of stripes, arboreal habits). While Cape York artist Percy Trezise believes the region is home to the thylacine, others have cited the popular urban myth of American soldiers bringing pumas to Queensland during World War II, with local Bob Whiston and tree kangaroo expert Roger Martin suggesting that sightings are of either Lumholtz's or Bennett's tree kangaroos, unfamiliar animals which walk on four legs when terrestrial and are found in the areas from which reports originate (this concurs with one of Bernard Heuvelmans' theories regarding some sightings). In popular culture The theory of continued Thylacoleo presence on mainland Australia and thylacine presence in Tasmania has been covered on various Television shows including an episode of Animal Planet's show Animal X and on The National Geographic Channel. Individual sightings of the Queensland marsupial tiger continue to appear in newspapers, though in far less numbers than formerly. In the 1970s, naturalist Janeice Plunkett collected over 100 reports of sightings or shootings of \\"tigers\\", including reports clearly indicating that the animal observed was a marsupial. Some writers believe that, if the animal did formerly exist, it may now be extinct, given the diminishing numbers of tiger quolls and northern quolls across the same region.

In 2005, Fordham announced its plans to close the women's college effective June 2007, but to keep the campus, which it renamed the Marymount campus, active as a center for graduate studies. Most of the 798 Marymount students were to finish their education at the Tarrytown campus, which was to be known as the Marymount Campus of Fordham University, pending the University's decision of whether to keep or sell the property. The Westchester division of the multi-campus Fordham College of Liberal Studies, already housed at the campus, would continue and expand its liberal arts program. Fordham announced that over time, the professional school programs in business administration, social service and education would move their Westchester operations to the Marymount Campus. In the press release announcing the phase out, the Board of Trustees of Fordham emphasized that Marymount juniors and seniors who graduated by spring 2007 would complete their degrees at Marymount College (and receive a Fordham degree and diploma), while freshmen and sophomores would complete their degrees in programs offered at one of the other four undergraduate colleges of Fordham University, if they indeed decided to remain at Fordham.

The M3 was subsequently replaced by the M1 90mm AA gun early in World War II, primarily during 1942.Berhow, pp. 256‚Äì258 The M3 3\\" gun was later adapted for the anti-tank role, serving as the main armament of the M10 tank destroyer during World War II. The predecessor: 3-inch gun M1917 3-inch M1917 The 3-inch gun M1917 was the United States Army's first dedicated anti-aircraft gun, entering service during World War I. Only a few were built, as the similar 3-inch gun M1918 on a mobile mount was considered more useful and was produced in large numbers. Development of the M1917 started in 1915, and as the name implies, took two years to enter service. The gun was essentially an unmodified 3-inch M1903 (76.2 mm L/55) coastal-defense gun barrel on a new fixed mount allowing it to be aimed to high elevations.Berhow, pp. 250‚Äì252Excerpt from online book A Magnificent Fight: Marines in the Battle for Wake Island by Robert J. Cressman A number were used during World War I on fixed mountings; 116 were completed by April 1919. Most of the weapons were deployed at United States Army Coast Artillery Corps seacoast forts after World War I. In the immediate post-war era it was developed as the 3-inch M2, using a removable barrel liner. In 1928 it was further improved in the 3-inch M4 by using a thicker removable liner that eased manufacturing. However, the M2 and M4 appear to have been produced in small quantities. The M1917, M2, and M4 remained in service through World War II. History of the 3-inch M1918 Gun crew man their 3-inch M3 at New Fighter Strip, Dobodura, New Guinea M10 tank destroyer, sporting the 3-inch M7 For mobile use the original coastal gun was too heavy, so a smaller version was developed as the 3-inch M1918. This weapon was based on the 3-inch gun M1898, a smaller predecessor of the M1903. This weapon had a barrel 50 calibers long instead of 55 calibers, and a smaller breech with a different cartridge (76.2x585R, 212 cubic inches instead of 76.2x690R, 293 cubic inches). The barrel of the M1918 was shortened to 40 calibers and a semi- automatic breech was added. \\"Semi-automatic\\" on this type of weapon meant that the breech would open automatically after firing. Like the adaptations that created the M2 and M4, the M1918 was also fitted with a removable liner in 1927 and a barrel 50 calibers long, becoming the 3-inch M1; a year later the M3 weapon was introduced with a larger removable liner. Another upgrade was started in 1931 as the T8, and then T9, but these projects were cancelled in 1938 when the 90 mm gun M1 was selected in their place. The 3-inch gun M1918 remained in service, particularly in National Guard units, and saw action in early World War II. In September 1940 a project started to adapt the 3-inch gun to the anti-tank role, starting with the T9 experimental model but equipping it with the breech, recoil system and carriage borrowed from the 105mm M2 howitzer. The gun was accepted for service as the 3-inch M5. A similar derivative of the T9 ‚Äì the 3-inch M6 ‚Äì was intended to be mounted on the M5 self-propelled gun, which was eventually abandoned. A final adaptation was the 3-inch M7, which included minor modifications for mounting on the M6 heavy tank and M10 tank destroyer. M7 saw wide use although it was supplanted to some extent by more powerful weapons such as the 90mm M3 and the British QF 17 pounder. 6,824 M7 guns were manufactured.Chamberlain, Gander ‚Äì Anti-Tank Weapons, p 49.

He was a prolific composer, with some 300 surviving works preserved in more than 10 publications; he was especially important for his keyboard music. Trabaci was born in Montepeloso (now Irsina, near Matera). Nothing is known about his early life. On 1 December 1594 he was appointed tenor at Santissima Annunziata Maggiore in Naples, but already in 1597 he must have been known as an organist and organ expert, because he was invited that year to test the organ of Oratorio dei Filippini. He served as organist there for a while, and then became, in 1601, organist to the Spanish viceroys at the Chapel Royal of Naples. The second organist was Ascanio Mayone, and Giovanni de Macque was maestro di cappella. Trabaci succeeded Macque in 1614 after the latter's death, and held the post for the rest of his life. Between 1625 and 1630 he also worked at the Oratorio dei Filippini. Trabaci was most noted for his keyboard works, which include ricercares, canzonas and toccatas collected in two publications (Libro primo..., 1603, Libro secondo..., 1615). His bold harmonic language, with unexpected modulations to distant keys, and experiments with structure in these works influenced Girolamo Frescobaldi. He wrote 2 pieces in that experimental idiom: His \\"Durezze et ligature\\" and \\"Consonanze stravaganti\\" (1603). He also wrote numerous sacred vocal works, but these are, in general, more conservative. His 1602 book of motets, Motectorum, features advanced harmonic writing and may have influenced Carlo Gesualdo's 1603 Sacrae cantiones.

It was built between 1894 and 1895 and still sits in its original foundation in downtown Phoenix. Named for Dr. Roland Lee Rosson and his wife Flora Murray Rosson, the house changed hands numerous times before being purchased by the City of Phoenix and restored to its original condition. Architecture South elevation This house is in the Stick-Eastlake Queen Anne Style of Victorian architecture. According to 19th century newspaper articles, it was designed by prominent San Francisco architect A.P. Petit.Arizona Gazette and Arizona Republican It would be his last house, as Petit died in the month of its completion. Controversy exists over the uniqueness of the design, since near exact plans for the house can be found in literature published prior, namely Design #1 as found in George Franklin Barber's Cottage Souvenir #2. The architecture displays numerous attributes contributed from different cultures, such as an Asian moon gate, Italianate hooded windows, and a French octagonal turret. History Dr. Roland Rosson came to Phoenix in 1879 where he established himself as a general physician and surgeon. Rosson practiced medicine on and off in Phoenix from 1879 until 1897. In addition to his career as a physician, Rosson was also involved in politics. In 1882 he was listed on the Democratic primary ticket. In 1884 he was elected Maricopa County coroner and public administrator.Arizona Gazette, 3-September-1884, 4-November-1884, 31-December-1884 In 1890 he won the office of county treasurer. In 1892 he was elected for a second term and later unsuccessfully attempted to secure the Democratic nomination for sheriff. On May 7, 1895, Rosson was elected Mayor of Phoenix. He served as a Democrat in this unpaid position along with four Republican councilmen. Rosson's position as mayor was short lived. After difficulties with the city council, he resigned his office on April 6, 1896, before his term was over. Rosson appears to have stayed active in the political scene in Phoenix and his name appears in multiple issues of The Arizona Republican newspaper.Phoenix Daily Herald, 27-Aug-1890, 17-November-1890; Arizona Gazette 31-August-1892, 8-September-1892, 17-September-1892, multiple dates October-1892; 9-November-1892, 23-June-1894. Roland Rosson married Flora B. Murray in Phoenix on August 11, 1880. The Rossons had a total of seven children - Irene, Vivien, Floy, Norma, and Clyde lived to adulthood. Their two other children died in infancy ‚Äì their first son Roland Lloyd died at age five weeks, and an unnamed daughter died at birth. In May 1882, the Rossons purchased Block 14 (now Heritage Square) in Phoenix, from Flora's half-sister, Margaret A. Richardson and her husband Mark P. Richardson for $1000. A newspaper article indicates that the Rossons spent $275 improving their residence in 1882, however the location of the residence is not noted. Prior to the construction of the Rosson House, it is likely that the Rossons lived on Block 14 in an adobe house. Sanborn maps indicate that the house was probably just south of the new house location.Maricopa County Recorder's Office, Book 8, pg. 3-6; Water Rights to Block 14 were sold from James A. Reavis to the Rossons on 12-Mar-1885; Arizona Gazette 2-Jan-1883 indicates that the Rosson residence was improved in 1882; Sanborn Fire Insurance map of Phoenix 1893; Phoenix City Directory, 1892 pg. 101 lists the Rosson residence as the corner of Tonto and Monroe. In September 1894, several articles appeared in local papers requesting bids for a house designed by architect A.P. Petit for R.L. Rosson at the corner of Monroe and 6th Streets. Late in September, another article lists the bids on the house, including a bid of $7,525 from George E. Cisney who became the contractor for the house. By December a newspaper article indicates that the house was near completion.Arizona Gazette 16-September-1894, 30-September-1894; Arizona Republican 16-September-1894. In February 1895, an article in the Arizona Republican discussing the northeastern part of Phoenix notes that \\"The most expensive homes in the city ‚Äì the Churchill, the Rosson, the Jacobs, the Murray and the Hine residences are in the immediate locality.\\" March 16, 1895 is the first appearance of an ad for Dr. Rosson's office and residence listing the location as the corner of Monroe and Sixth streets.Arizona Gazette 23-December-1894; Arizona Republican 10-February-1895; Phoenix Daily Herald 16-March-1895. The Rosson House was built with modern accommodations such as electric lights, hot and cold running water, an indoor upstairs bathroom, and a telephone. Other contemporary Victorian mansions on Monroe were similarly equipped - by 1892, Phoenix boasted electrical plants, a domestic water system, a gas system, and two competing telephone companies. The Phoenix street-car line ran down Monroe before turning north on Seventh Street, so the Rossons and other Monroe Street residents had only to walk out to board it. The Rossons continued to own the home and the remainder of Block 14. However, during the winter of 1895-1896 and 1896-1897, the Rosson family rented their home to Whitelaw Reid, an influential Republican and head of the New York Tribune newspaper. No sources indicate where the Rosson family resided during that time. Reid had a lung condition and his doctors recommended he travel to Arizona for his health. The Reid family arrived at the Rosson House in November 1895, where he followed an open-air regimen. The Tribune was run from Phoenix by typed letters and telegraphs. Reid's letters are an excellent primary source about the early Rosson House and life in Phoenix at the time. He also wrote editorials for papers like the Los Angeles Herald in which he advertised the benefits of Arizona and Phoenix. In 1896, the Reids rented both the Rosson House and Jerry Millay's nearby house.Los Angeles Herald, 8-March-1896; The San Francisco Call, 18-January-1897; The Library of Congress holds Reid's Family papers, copies of some letters are available at Heritage Square, Phoenix. The Teeter Carriage House, built in 1899 In June 1897, the Rossons sold their house and the north half of Block 14. The family moved to Los Angeles, California by July 27 of 1897. The exact reasons for their move are unknown. Newspaper accounts suggest that the Rossons may have had financial difficulties. According to delinquent tax records listed in the newspapers in 1896 and 1897, both Roland and Flora owed back taxes. Renting their newly constructed house to Whitelaw Reid also suggests that the Rossons needed additional income. The family may also have moved for other reasons. Rosson's obituary in 1898 states that \\"‚Ä¶he removed with his family to Los Angeles on account of the educational advantages.\\"Maricopa County Recorder's Office deed dated 9-August-1897 shows Rosson's address as Los Angeles as of 27-July-1897; Articles in the Arizona Republican 25-January-1896 and 16-January-1897 indicates penalties owed by Dr. Rosson and Mrs. Rosson on Block 14 lots; Arizona Gazette 13-May-1898. Little is known about Dr. Rosson's brief time in Los Angeles. On May 12, 1898, after an illness of several weeks, Dr. Rosson died. Initially, his death was considered suspicious and possibly a suicide. Shortly before his death, Rosson had purchased life insurance from several different companies. An autopsy and subsequent coroner's jury in Los Angeles ruled the death to be a result of gastroenteritis.Phoenix Daily Herald 12-May-1898, 13-May-1898, 14-May-1898, 15-May-1898, 21-Jun-1898; Los Angeles Herald 14-May-1898,15-May-1898. Little else is known of Flora's life. She died in Los Angeles from \\"tubercular laryngitis\\" at age fifty-two on September 9, 1911. Her death certificate listed her occupation as \\"household duties.\\" Other Owners of the Rosson House On June 3, 1897, Aaron Goldberg and his wife, Carrie, purchased the house and north half of Block 14 from the Rossons for $10,000. Aaron and Carrie Goldberg were a prominent Jewish couple in Phoenix. Aaron co-owned Goldberg's clothing store and was also engaged in political and civic activities. A member of the 19th and 20th Territorial Legislature, Goldberg wrote the bill that permanently located the capitol in Phoenix. He also served on the Phoenix City Council, the Board of Trade, and the Capitol Commission.The Goldberg children included Hazel, Selma and Chester (Chet), who, according to his obituary, was born in the Rosson House.Prescott Courier 16-Sept-1974; The Arizona Jewish Historical Society and the Arizona Historical Society both hold archival collections of Goldberg material (AHS see PP MSS 244). On September 7, 1904, the Goldbergs sold the house and property to \\"S.W.\\" Higley. Steven W. Higley started out as a railroad builder, became a land owner and later was a partner in the Arizona Republican newspaper.The town of Higley is named after S.W. Higley ‚Äì Arizona Republican 6-July-1910; Republican. The 1905-06 Phoenix City Directory lists Higley as \\"road master Santa Fe route, residence 139 N. 6th Street.\\" The 1911 Phoenix City Directory lists Higley as \\"president, Arizona Republican.\\" Higley lived in the Rosson House with wife Jessie Freemont Howe, sons Thomas and James, as well as his daughter Jessie Jean. Later, both Thomas and James served in World War I. James died on the battlefield and Thomas returned home and went on to open Tom's Tavern in Phoenix. Jessie Jean went on to marry E. B. Lane. Much of the information known about the Higley family comes from several interviews conducted with daughter Jessie Jean Lane in the 1970s.Notes and partial transcript on file in Heritage Square Archives. Audio recording and transcript on file with the Arizona Historical Society in Tempe, Arizona. The Higleys sold the Rosson House and portions of the larger lot to the Gammel family on August 22, 1914. The Gammel family owned and lived in the Rosson House longer than any other family. Earlier, William Gammel had been a gambler in Jerome, Arizona. In 1904, he married Francis Christopher, a Hispanic woman from Tucson. The couple had 3 daughters ‚Äì Annie (b. 1906), Wilma (b. 1908), and Atlanta Georgia (b.1909). Gammel was a co-owner of the Capitol Saloon at 28-30 E. Washington. Shortly after buying the Rosson House, Prohibition became law in Arizona and it hurt Gammel's business. In the 1916 Phoenix City Directory, his business was called the Capitol Buffet and sold soft drinks. In 1919, Gammel was listed as an orange grower, and two years later, the Phoenix City Directory said Mrs. Frankie Gammel had furnished rooms available (in the Rosson House).Much of the information on the Gammels comes interviews with Georgia Gammel Valliere in May 1986. Notes and a partial transcript are available through Heritage Square, Phoenix. The Gammel family lived in the Rosson House until 1948 and ran a rooming/boarding house. To make the house better for renters, the Gammels made drastic changes to the house including walling in porches, subdividing floors and adding multiple kitchens and bathrooms. After 1948, the Rosson House changed hands multiple times and continued to operate as a rooming house, eventually becoming a \\"flop house\\" and falling into disrepair. The City of Phoenix purchased the Rosson House and the remainder of Block 14 in 1974. The Rosson House was restored through a community effort involving the City of Phoenix, dozens of local institutions and hundreds of volunteers. Other brick landmarks The Rosson House is an early example, though not the first, of a house in Phoenix constructed of fired brick and wood instead of adobe bricks. Brick was Petit's preferred building material. At least one local brick-making factory had previously been established, and some fine examples of early brick houses that predate the Rosson House include the mansion built in 1887 for John T. Dennis at 242 E. Monroe and its neighbor at 230 E. Monroe built for M. Jacobs. The John T. Dennis mansion was demolished in the 1950s. Additionally, there was the large house built for Columbus Gray in 1890, and the J.Y.T. Smith House at 5th St. and Adams reportedly dates from 1892. Almost all of the early hotels of Phoenix were made out of locally produced red bricks as well. A number of smaller homes were built outside the city limits in the 1880s by J.J. Welty, and made out of poured concrete blocks made to look like hewn stone. There is also the mansion built by John T. Dennis' neighbor Clark Churchill which later became the first home of Phoenix Union High School. Access Heritage Square Foundation and Guild operates the restored Rosson House as a historic house museum in the city of Phoenix Heritage and Science Park and offers public tours.

History Passing the crag is Blackstone Edge Long Causeway, also known as Blackstone Edge Roman Road, a paved road originally thought to be of Roman origin. After investigations by James Maxim it is now considered to be a 1735 turnpike or packhorse route. The Aiggin Stone, a gritstone pillar, possibly a way-marker, stands alongside the packhorse route and marks the county boundary. The stone has a cross and the letters I and T cut into it. Its name is said to derive from the French aiguille for a needle or aigle for an eagle. The Aiggin Stone and cairn on Blackstone Edge Moor Much of the surrounding area was within the ancient parish of Hundersfield, although some parts lay within Butterworth township. In the English Civil War the Parliamentarians sent 800 men to fortify Blackstone Edge; John Rosworm came from Manchester to direct the construction of defences. It was successfully held against an attack by Royalist cavalry. In 1660 the churchwardens of St Chad's paid 24 shillings for eight loads of \\"great stones from Blackstoneedge\\" for Rochdale church steps. Celia Fiennes travelled over Blackstone Edge and described her journey in about 1700. A meeting of supporters of Chartism from the surrounding industrial towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire was held in 1846, attracting up to 30,000 people. Sport Blackstone Edge is frequented by walkers and rock climbers who use its traditional climbing and bouldering routes. The crag was featured in Some Gritstone Climbs, a pioneering 1913 guide to rock-climbing in the Peak District, by John Laycock. One walking route is a circular walk from Hollingworth Lake in Smithy Bridge near Littleborough up to Blackstone Edge, and another route links Blackstone Edge to Hebden Bridge in the Calder Valley. The Pennine Way long-distance footpath from Edale in the Derbyshire Peak District to Kirk Yetholm in Scotland passes along the top of the outcrop. It is also an alternative route of the Rochdale Way. From the summit one can see Manchester city centre, Winter Hill in the West Pennine Moors, and the mountains in North Wales in clear weather. Halifax Road, which goes up towards Blackstone Edge reservoir, provides a popular cycling ascent. With 240m of ascent from the centre of Littleborough, at an average gradient of 5%, it is recognised as a category 3 climb on Strava.

A Yes/No People performance can be seen in the Bette Midler HBO special Mondo Beyondo. On 9 September 1986 the band appeared at the Limelight, London. On 28 March 1987 the band appeared in an episode of Saturday Live aired on Channel 4, in which they performed the track 'Some Things Are True'.Yes/No People - Some Things Are True on Saturday Live A track from the band appeared on the London Records sampler Giant in September 1987, along with tracks by other bands such as Hothouse Flowers and Voice Of The Beehive. In 1988 the band's debut single \\"Mr Johnson\\" was released. The single failed to reach the UK Singles Chart, however and, apart from the theme tune to Channel 4's Wired, no further music was heard from the band in the 1980s. At this point, with the traditional band set-up failing to make much headway in the charts, Yes/No People moved into other areas and decided to go back to the musical theatre idea of Pookiesnackenburger. Stomp In 1991 the ITV Children's show presented by Andrea Arnold, called A Beetle Called Derek appeared and included a number of percussive video shorts by Yes/No People. It was from these parts that \\"Stomp\\" was developed as a full-length theatre show. Stomp had a large and varying line-up centred on Cresswell and McNicholas, appearing first at the Edinburgh Fringe, Royal Court Theatre, and for several years on international tour. In 1994 they recorded the theme tune for the children's television programme, Blue Peter, which was used from September 1994 until August 1999.

Passwords or passphrases created by humans are often short or predictable enough to allow password cracking, and key stretching is intended to make such attacks more difficult by complicating a basic step of trying a single password candidate. Key stretching also improves security in some real-world applications where the key length has been constrained, by mimicking a longer key length from the perspective of a brute-force attacker. There are several ways to perform key stretching. One way is to apply a cryptographic hash function or a block cipher repeatedly in a loop. For example, in applications where the key is used for a cipher, the key schedule in the cipher may be modified so that it takes a specific length of time to perform. Another way is to use cryptographic hash functions that have large memory requirements ‚Äì these can be effective in frustrating attacks by memory- bound adversaries.  Process  Key stretching algorithms depend on an algorithm which receives an input key and then expends considerable effort to generate a stretched cipher (called an enhanced key) mimicking randomness and longer key length. The algorithm must have no known shortcut, so the most efficient way to relate the input and cipher is to repeat the key stretching algorithm itself. This compels brute-force attackers to expend the same effort for each attempt. If this added effort compares to a brute-force key search of all keys with a certain key length, then the input key may be described as stretched by that same length. Key stretching leaves an attacker with two options: * Attempt possible combinations of the enhanced key, but this is infeasible if the enhanced key is sufficiently long and unpredictable ( ‚Å†i.e.,the algorithm mimics randomness well enough that the attacker must trial the entire stretched key space) * Attempt possible combinations of the weaker initial key, potentially commencing with a dictionary attack if the initial key is a password or passphrase, but the attacker's added effort for each trial could render the attack uneconomic should the costlier computation and memory consumption outweigh the expected profit If the attacker uses the same class of hardware as the user, each guess will take the similar amount of time to process as it took the user (for example, one second). Even if the attacker has much greater computing resources than the user, the key stretching will still slow the attacker down while not seriously affecting the usability of the system for any legitimate user. This is because the user's computer only has to compute the stretching function once upon the user entering their password, whereas the attacker must compute it for every guess in the attack. This process does not alter the original key-space entropy. The key stretching algorithm is deterministic, allowing a weak input to always generate the same enhanced key, but therefore limiting the enhanced key to no more possible combinations than the input key space. Consequently, this attack remains vulnerable if unprotected against certain time-memory tradeoffs such as developing rainbow tables to target multiple instances of the enhanced key space in parallel (effectively a shortcut to repeating the algorithm). For this reason, key stretching is often combined with salting.  Hash-based  Many libraries provide functions which perform key stretching as part of their function; see crypt(3) for an example. PBKDF2 is for generating an encryption key from a password, and not necessarily for password authentication. PBKDF2 can be used for both if the number of output bits is less than or equal to the internal hashing algorithm used in PBKDF2, which is usually SHA-2 (up to 512 bits), or used as an encryption key to encrypt static data.  Strength and time  These examples assume that a personal computer can do about 65,000 SHA-1 hashes in one second. Thus, a program that uses key stretching can use 65,000 rounds of hashes and delay the user for at most one second. Note that a USD$700 GPU from July 2019 can do more than 10 billion SHA-1 hashes in one second., PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1 with 1,000 iterations costs 2,002 SHA-1 hashes at a speed of 5,164.9 kH/s which comes to 10,340,129,800 SHA-1 hashes per second. Testing a trial password or passphrase typically requires one hash operation. But if key stretching was used, the attacker must compute a strengthened key for each key they test, meaning there are 65,000 hashes to compute per test. This increases the attacker's workload by a factor of 65,000, approximately 216, which means the enhanced key is worth about 16 additional bits in key strength. Moore's law asserts that computer speed doubles roughly every 1.5 years. Under this assumption, every 1.5 years one more bit of key strength is plausibly brute-forcible. This implies that 16 extra bits of strength is worth about 16√ó1.5 = 24 years later cracking, but it also means that the number of key stretching rounds a system uses should be doubled about every 1.5 years to maintain the same level of security (since most keys are more secure than necessary, systems that require consistent deterministic key generation will likely not update the number of iterations used in key stretching. In such a case, the designer should take into consideration how long they wish for the key derivation system to go unaltered and should choose an appropriate number of hashes for the lifespan of the system). CPU-bound hash functions are still vulnerable to hardware implementations. Such implementations of SHA-1 exist using as few as 5,000 gates, and 400 clock cycles.http://events.iaik.tugraz.at/RFIDSec08/Papers/Publication/04%20-%20ONeill%20-%20Low%20Cost%20SHA-1%20-%20Slides.pdf With multi-million gate FPGAs costing less than $100, an attacker can build a fully unrolled hardware cracker for about $5,000. Such a design, clocked at 100 MHz can test about 300,000 keys/second. The attacker is free to choose a good price/speed compromise, for example a 150,000 keys/second design for $2,500. The key stretching still slows down the attacker in such a situation; a $5,000 design attacking a straight SHA-1 hash would be able to try 300,000√∑216 ‚âà 4.578 keys/second. To defend against the hardware approach, memory-bound cryptographic functions have been developed. These access large amounts of memory in an unpredictable fashion such that caches are ineffective. Since large amounts of low latency memory are expensive, a would- be attacker is significantly deterred.  History  The first deliberately slow password-based key derivation function \\"CRYPT\\" was described in 1978 by Robert Morris for encrypting Unix passwords. It used an iteration count of 25, a 12-bit salt and a variant of DES as the sub-function. (DES proper was avoided in an attempt to frustrate attacks using standard DES hardware.) Passwords were limited to a maximum of eight ASCII characters. While it was a great advancement for its time, CRYPT(3) is now considered inadequate. The iteration count, designed for the PDP-11 era, is too low, 12 bits of salt is an inconvenience but does not stop precomputed dictionary attacks, and the 8 character limit prevents the use of stronger passphrases. Modern password- based key derivation functions, such as PBKDF2, use a cryptographic hash, such as SHA-2, a longer salt (e.g. 64 bits) and a high iteration count (tens or hundreds of thousands). In 2009, a memory-intensive key strengthening algorithm, scrypt, was introduced with the intention of limiting the use of custom, highly parallel hardware to speed up key testing.Scryptscrypt: A new key derivation function, Colin Percival, BSDCan 2009, accessed 2011-2-1 In 2013, a Password Hashing Competition was held to select an improved key stretching standard that would resist attacks from graphics processors and special purpose hardware.

He was founder of the literary, arts and society gazette \\"le Mercure galant\\" (founded in 1672) and was associated with the \\"Moderns\\" in the \\"Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns\\". Life Donneau de Vis√© was born in Paris. He was among the detractors of Moli√®re during the quarrel over Moli√®re's play \\"The School for Wives\\" (1662, \\"l‚Äô√âcole des femmes\\"), accusing the author of obscenity and moral licentiousness. But Donneau de Vis√© eventually became reconciled with the comic playwright and contributed his own plays to Moli√®re's acting troop, starting with la M√®re coquette (1665) and (after Moli√®re's death) several \\"machine\\" plays (\\"pi√®ces √† machines\\", i.e. plays with elaborate special scenic effects) written in collaboration with Thomas Corneille -- Circ√© (1675) and la Devineresse (1679) -- which were very successful in their runs at the H√¥tel Gu√©n√©gaud. Donneau de Vis√© wrote a collection of short novelas: Nouvelles galantes et comiques (1669). In 1672, Donneau de Vis√© founded the \\"Mercure galant\\", a gazette on the arts, theater and literature, which also included galant songs and society news and gossip. Although frequently denigrated by authors of the period (such as Jean de La Bruy√®re), the periodical eventually became a financial success, and brought (along with his plays and his work as royal historian) Donneau de Vis√© comfortable revenues. At his death in 1710, Donneau de Vis√©'s \\"Mercure galant\\" had become the uncontested arbiter of literary taste and the paper of record for news about the court and court society for subscribers in the provinces. Work In 1664, Donneau de Vis√© produced a heterogenous literary compilation under the title Les Diversit√©s gallantes (English:Various Galantries). It was published by Claude Barbin, initially consisting of:Stedman (2012), pp. 1‚Äì5 *A preface dedicated to Louis Joseph, Duke of Guise, who had just inherited his title, and a dialogue discussing his qualities, 16 pages in length. *The novella L'apothicaire de qualit√©, nouvellee galante et veritable (English: The Noble Apothecary, A Gallant and True Story), 45 pages in length. *A letter critique of the recent theatrical output of Moli√®re, 15 pages in length. *A comic novella set at a Parisian inn, 52 pages in length. *The seven-scene, one-act theatrical play La Veng√©ance des Marquis (English: The Marquis' Revenge), 40 pages in length. The work proved popular and was reprinted twice in 1664. The 1665 edition added to the work two previously published novellas: L'Avanture d'hostellerie, ou les Deux rivales (English:Adventure at the Inn, or The Two Rivals) and Le Mariage de Belfegore, nouvelle fac√©tieuse (English: The marriage of Belphegor, a Mischievous Novella). The work continued to receive new editions to the 1670s, both at France and abroad. Allison Stedman summarizes the plot of The Noble Apothecary, which focuses on noble protagonists Timante (male) and Araminte (female). Timante regularly visits the residence of his friend Araminte, and a servant escorts him to her bedroom. There the two discuss various topics, with Araminte lounging in bed and the visitor sited nearby. The presence of servants and other visitors ensures that they are never alone. One day, Timante enters to find the house seemingly deserted but still heads towards Araminte's bedroom. He finds Araminte kneeling on the bed, with her behind uncovered. She is waiting for someone to administer an enema, and the syringe has already been prepared. Timante impulsively the role of an apothecary and delivers the treatment. Then slips away unseen. Araminte and her staff can not explain who entered the bedroom. Rumors of a ghost apothecary soon circulate in Paris. When the identity of the ghost is discovered, Araminte is humiliated and bans entry to her house to Timante. In a series of epistles, Timante tries to convince her to reconsider. He rationally argues that his treatment of her was an act of gallantry (chivalry), assisting her in her hour of need. With Cartesian-like arguments, Timante wins her over and proceeds to marry her. The society around them puzzled by a properly-delivered enema as grounds for marriage. Stedman finds the circumstances surrounding this work to be indicative of the publishing trends of the 17th-century. Novelistic works of various lengths and genres were typically published as part of wider books. Sharing room with ghost stories, fairy tales, allegories, poetry, etc. Virtually any type of work could end up published along a novel. But these novels, and novellas are rarely studied in the context which they originally appeared. And they are often overlooked altogether. What she terms \\"hybrid literary production\\" chronologically follows the lengthy, action-oriented novels of the previous era. And they both precede and differ from the new dominant literary form of the reign of Louis XIV: the short, psychologically- realistic novellas epitomized by La Princesse de Cl√®ves (1678).

The park is part of a sandy spit of land called Long Point that juts out into the lake. It covers part of the area of Long Point Biosphere Reserve, which was designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve because of its biological significance. Summary Long Point Provincial Park is famous for its migrating birds during spring and fall, and attracts thousands of birdwatchers. There have been 383 different species recorded on Long Point. Many different types of turtles and snakes are a common sight during the summer season. The park is within the most significant part of the core range of the Fowler's toad (Anaxyrus fowleri). This species of toad is designated as a threatened species within Ontario and Canada by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. There are two parts to the park, the \\"Old Park\\" (also known as Cottonwood Campground), which is a small chunk of land surrounded by cottages that contains about eighty camp sites; it just recently got showers and comfort stations (washroom).

MPS degrees are often interdisciplinary. While Master of Arts and Master of Science degree programs tend to focus on theory and research, Master of Professional Studies degrees tend to emphasize practical skills designed for current and aspiring professionals, including post-bachelor and post-graduate students, and often require some amount of fieldwork or internship to complement classroom learning. Admission to the MPS program typically requires documentation of professional experience and competencies, in addition to an earned undergraduate degree or postgraduate education and satisfactory standardized test scores such as the Graduate Record Examination.

The TMT would become the largest visible-light telescope on Mauna Kea. Scientists have been considering ELTs since the mid 1980s. In 2000, astronomers considered the possibility of a telescope with a light-gathering mirror larger than 20 meters in diameter. The technology to build a mirror larger than 8.4 meters does not exist; instead scientists considered using either small segments that create one large mirror, or a grouping of larger 8-meter mirrors working as one unit. The US National Academy of Sciences recommended a 30-meter telescope be the focus of U.S. interests, seeking to see it built within the decade. Scientists at the University of California and Caltech began development of a design that would eventually become the TMT, consisting of a 492-segment primary mirror with nine times the power of the Keck Observatory. Due to its immense light- gathering power and the optimal observing conditions which exist atop Mauna Kea, the TMT would enable astronomers to conduct research which is infeasible with current instruments. The TMT is designed for near-ultraviolet to mid- infrared (0.31 to 28 Œºm wavelengths) observations, featuring adaptive optics to assist in correcting image blur. The TMT will be at the highest altitude of all the proposed ELTs. The telescope has government-level support from several nations. Demonstrations attracted press coverage after October 2014, when construction was temporarily halted due to a blockade of the roadway. While construction of the telescope was set to resume on April 2 and later on June 24, 2015, it was blocked by further protests each time. In 2015, Governor David Ige announced several changes to the management of Mauna Kea, including a requirement that the TMT's site will be the last new site on Mauna Kea to be developed for a telescope. The Board of Land and Natural Resources approved the TMT project, but the Supreme Court of Hawaii invalidated the building permits in December 2015, ruling that the board had not followed due process. On October 30, 2018, the Court approved the resumption of construction,Hawaii top court approves controversial Thirty Meter Telescope BBC News, 2018-10-31. and Hawaii Gov. David Ige announced that construction would resume the week of July 15, 2019. Background In 2000, astronomers began considering the potential of telescopes larger than 20 meters in diameter. Two technologies were considered: segmented mirrors like that of the Keck Observatory and the use of a group of 8-meter mirrors mounted to form a single unit. The US National Academy of Sciences made a suggestion that a 30-meter telescope should be the focus of US astronomy interests and recommended that it be built within the decade. The University of California, along with Caltech, began development of a 30-meter telescope that same year. The California Extremely Large Telescope (CELT) began development, along with the Giant Magellan Telescope, the Giant Segmented Mirror Telescope (GSMT), and the Very Large Optical Telescope (VLOT). These studies would eventually become the Thirty Meter Telescope. The TMT would have nine times the collecting area of the older Keck telescope using slightly smaller mirror segments in a vastly larger group. Another telescope of a large diameter in the works is the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) being built in northern Chile. The telescope is designed for observations from near-ultraviolet to mid-infrared (0.31 to 28 Œºm wavelengths). In addition, its adaptive optics system will help correct for image blur caused by the atmosphere of the Earth, helping it to reach the potential of such a large mirror. Among existing and planned ELTs, the TMT will have the highest elevation and will be the second-largest telescope once the E-ELT is built. Both use segments of small 1.44 m hexagonal mirrors‚Äîa design vastly different from the large mirrors of the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) or the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT). Each night, the TMT would collect 90 terabytes of data. The TMT has government-level support from the following countries: Canada, China, Japan and India. The United States is also contributing some funding, but less than the formal partnership. Proposed locations World map of proposed Thirty Meter Telescope sites - orange denotes lights; blue denotes elevation (land and water separately) In cooperation with AURA, the TMT project completed a multi-year evaluation of five sites: * Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, La Palma, Canary Islands, Spain * Cerro Armazones, Antofagasta Region, Republic of Chile * Cerro Tolanchar, Antofagasta Region, Republic of Chile * Cerro Tolar, Antofagasta Region, Republic of Chile * Mauna Kea, Hawaii, United States (This site was chosen and approval was granted in April 2013) * San Pedro M√°rtir, Baja California, Mexico * Hanle, Ladakh, India The TMT Observatory Corporation board of directors narrowed the list to two sites, one in each hemisphere, for further consideration: Cerro Armazones in Chile's Atacama Desert and Mauna Kea on Hawaii Island. On July 21, 2009, the TMT board announced Mauna Kea as the preferred site. The final TMT site selection decision was based on a combination of scientific, financial, and political criteria. Chile is also where the European Southern Observatory is building the E-ELT. If both next- generation telescopes were in the same hemisphere, there would be many astronomical objects that neither could observe. The telescope was given approval by the state Board of Land and Natural Resources in April 2013. There has been opposition to the building of the telescope, based on potential disruption to the fragile alpine environment of Mauna Kea due to construction, traffic, and noise, which is a concern for the habitat of several species, and because Mauna Kea is a sacred site for the Native Hawaiian culture. The Hawaii Board of Land and Natural Resources conditionally approved the Mauna Kea site for the TMT in February 2011. The approval has been challenged; however, the Board officially approved the site following a hearing on February 12, 2013. Because of the ongoing protests that re-erupted in July 2019, the TMT project officials requested a building permit for a second site choice, the Spanish island of La Palma in the Canary Islands. Rafael Rebolo, the director of the Canary Islands Astrophysics Institute, confirmed that he had received a letter requesting a building permit for the site as a backup in case the Hawaii site cannot be constructed. However, environmentalists in the Canary Islands are gearing up to fight against its construction there as well, citing the loss of archeological and cultural sites. Partnerships and funding The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation has committed US$200 million for construction. Caltech and the University of California have committed an additional US$50 million each. Japan, which has its own large telescope at Mauna Kea, the 8.3-metre Subaru, is also a partner. In 2008, the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) joined TMT as a Collaborating Institution. The following year, the telescope cost was estimated to be $970 million to $1.4 billion. That same year, the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC) joined TMT as an observer. On June 16, 2010, Governor Linda Lingle and University of Hawaii-Hilo Chancellor Rose Tseng attended a banquet at the Great Hall of the People at Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China, sponsored by the China Diplomatic Friendship Association and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. The banquet included special guest Lu Yong Xiang, vice chairman of the Chinese People‚Äôs National Congress and head of the Chinese National Academy of Sciences who had visited Mauna Kea as part of China's intention to become a collaborative partner with the TMT. The governor gave a presentation on the two competing site locations, Mauna Kea and Cerro Armazones, Chile. Speaking at a Chinese Academy of Science conference in 1995, Lu Yong Xiang stated that by the year 2010, the academy would become one of the leading international scientific institutions with new research results in such fields as Moon exploration, evolution of the universe and of life, space micro-gravity, particle physics, and astrophysics. In 2010, a consortium of Indian Astronomy Research Institutes (IIA, IUCAA and ARIES) joined TMT project as an observer. The observer status is the first step in becoming a full partner in the construction of the TMT and participating in the engineering development and scientific use of the observatory (subject to approval of funding from the Indian government). Two years later, India and China became partners with representatives on the TMT board. Both countries agreed to share the telescope construction costs, expected to top $1 billion. India became a full member of the TMT consortium in 2014. In 2019 the India based company Larsen & Toubro (L&T;) were awarded the contract to build the segment support assembly (SSA), which ‚Äúare complex optomechanical sub- assemblies on which each hexagonal mirror of the 30-metre primary mirror, the heart of the telescope, is mounted‚Äù. The IndiaTMT Optics Fabricating Facility (ITOFF) will be constructed at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics campus in the city of Hosakote, near Bengaluru. India will also supply 80 of the 492 mirror segments for the TMT. A.N. Ramaprakash, the associate programme director of India-TMT, stated; \\"All sensors, actuators and SSAs for the whole telescope are being developed and manufactured in India, which will be put together in building the heart of TMT\\", also adding; \\"Since it is for the first time that India is involved in such a technically demanding astronomy project, it is also an opportunity to put to test the abilities of Indian scientists and industries, alike.\\" The continued financial commitment from the Canadian government had been in doubt due to economic pressures. Nevertheless, on April 6, 2015, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that Canada would commit $243.5 million over a period of 10 years. The telescope's unique enclosure was designed by Dynamic Structures Ltd. in British Columbia. In an online petition, a group of Canadian academics called on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau together with Industry Minister Navdeep Bains and Science Minister Kirsty Duncan to divest Canadian funding from the project. The Canadian astronomy community has recently named TMT its top facility priority for the decade ahead. Design Thirty Meter Telescope design (late 2007). The TMT would be housed in a general-purpose observatory capable of investigating a broad range of astrophysical problems. The total diameter of the dome will be 217 feet with the total dome height at 180 feet (comparable in height to an eighteen-storey building). The total area of the structure is projected to be 1.44 acres within a 5-acre complex. Telescope The centerpiece of the TMT Observatory is to be a Ritchey-Chr√©tien telescope with a diameter primary mirror. This mirror is to be segmented and consist of 492 smaller (1.4 m), individual hexagonal mirrors. The shape of each segment, as well as its position relative to neighboring segments, will be controlled actively. A secondary mirror is to produce an unobstructed field-of-view of 20 arcminutes in diameter with a focal ratio of 15. A 3.5 √ó 2.5 metre flat tertiary mirror is to direct the light path to science instruments mounted on large Nasmyth platforms. The telescope is to have an alt-azimuth mount. Target acquisition and system configuration capabilities need to be achieved within 5 minutes, or ten minutes if relocating to a newer device. To achieve these time limitations the TMT will use a software architecture linked by a service based communications system. The moving mass of the telescope, optics, and instruments will be 1430 tonnes. The design of the facility descends from the Keck Observatory. Adaptive optics Mirror sizes of existing and proposed telescopes. The two other new ELT the E-ELT and GMT are being built in the southern hemisphere Integral to the observatory is a Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) system. This MCAO system will measure atmospheric turbulence by observing a combination of natural (real) stars and artificial laser guide stars. Based on these measurements, a pair of deformable mirrors will be adjusted many times per second to correct optical wave-front distortions caused by the intervening turbulence. This system will produce diffraction- limited images over a 30-arc-second diameter field-of-view, which means that the core of the point spread function will have a size of 0.015 arc-second at a wavelength of 2.2 micrometers, almost ten times better than the Hubble Space Telescope. Scientific instrumentation =Early-light capabilities= Three instruments are planned to be available for scientific observations: * Wide Field Optical Spectrometer (WFOS) provides a seeing limit that goes down to the ultra violet with optical (0.3‚Äì1.0 Œºm wavelength) imaging and spectroscopy capable of 40-square arc-minute field-of-view. The TMT will use precision cut focal plane masks and enable long-slit observations of individual objects as well as short-slit observations of hundreds of different objects at the same time. The spectrometer will use natural (uncorrected) seeing images. * Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS) mounted on the observatory MCAO system, capable of diffraction-limited imaging and integral- field spectroscopy at near-infrared wavelengths (0.8‚Äì2.5 Œºm). Principal investigators are James Larkin of UCLA and Anna Moore of Caltech. Project scientist is Shelley Wright of UC San Diego. * Infrared Multi-object Spectrometer (IRMS) allowing close to diffraction-limited imaging and slit spectroscopy over a 2 arc-minute diameter field-of-view at near-infrared wavelengths (0.8‚Äì2.5 Œºm). Approval process and protests Cultural practitioner Joshua Lanakila Mangauil, along with Kaho ªokahi Kanuha and Hawaiian sovereignty supporters block the access road to Mauna Kea in October 2014, demonstrating against the building of the Thirty Meter Telescope. In 2008, the TMT corporation selected two semi-finalists for further study, Mauna Kea and Cerro Amazones. In July 2009, Mauna Kea was selected. Once TMT selected Mauna Kea, the project began a regulatory and community process for approval. Mauna Kea is ranked as one of the best sites on Earth for telescope viewing and is home to 13 other telescopes built at the summit of the mountain, within the Mauna Kea Observatories grounds.TI Here's why we should build it anyway Telescopes generate money for the big island, with millions of dollars in jobs and subsidies gained by the state. The TMT would be one of the most expensive telescopes ever created. The proposed construction of the TMT on Mauna Kea sparked protests and demonstrations across the state of Hawaii. Mauna Kea is the most sacred mountain in Hawaiian culture as well as conservation land held in trust by the state of Hawaii. TMT will be sited on the northern plateau of Mauna Kea at a location known as the 13N site within ‚ÄúArea E,‚Äù which is part of the 525-acre Astronomy Precinct. It was identified in the 1983 Mauna Kea Science Reserve Complex Development Plan and in the subsequent 2000 Mauna Kea Science Reserve Master Plan as the preferred location because it will have minimal impact on existing facilities, Wekiu bug habitat, archaeology / historic sites and view planes. The site was selected in consultation with Kahu Ku Mauna, which in Hawaiian means Guardians of the Mountain. The nine-member native Hawaiian council advises the Mauna Kea Management Board, Office of Mauna Kea Management and the University of Hawaii at Hilo‚Äôs Chancellor on cultural matters. The specific site was selected because it is not visible from any of the places that people consider the most sacred on the mountain and because there are no archeological finds, ancient burials, or endangered native flora or fauna in the immediate area, and because it can be developed without a lot of grading. Initial approval, permit and contested case hearing In 2010 Governor Linda Lingle of the State of Hawaii signed off on an environmental study after 14 community meetings. The BLNR held hearings on December 2 and December 3, 2010, on the application for a permit. On February 25, 2011, the board granted the permits after multiple public hearings. This approval had conditions, in particular, that a hearing about contesting the approval be heard. A contested case hearing was held in August 2011, which led to a judgment by the hearing officer for approval in November 2012. The telescope was given approval by the state Board of Land and Natural Resources in April 2013. This process was challenged in court with a lower court ruling in May 2014. The Intermediate Court of Appeals of the State of Hawaii declined to hear an appeal regarding the permit until the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources first issued a decision from the contested case hearing that could then be appealed to the court. First blockade, construction halts, State Supreme Court invalidates permit The dedication and ground-breaking ceremony was held, but interrupted by protesters on October 7, 2014. The project became the focal point of escalating political conflict, police arrests and continued litigation over the proper use of conservation lands. Native Hawaiian cultural practice and religious rights became central to the opposition, with concerns over the lack of meaningful dialogue during the permitting process. In late March 2015, demonstrators again halted the construction crews. On April 2, 2015, about 300 protesters gathered on Mauna Kea, some of them trying to block the access road to the summit; 23 arrests were made. Once the access road to the summit was cleared by the police, about 40 to 50 protesters began following the heavily laden and slow-moving construction trucks to the summit construction site. On April 7, 2015, the construction was halted for one week at the request of Hawaii state governor David Ige, after the protest on Mauna Kea continued. Project manager Gary Sanders stated that TMT agreed to the one- week stop for continued dialogue; Kealoha Pisciotta, president of Mauna Kea Anaina Hou, one of the organizations that have challenged the TMT in court,Hawaii Court Rescinds Permit to Build Thirty Meter Telescope viewed the development as positive but said opposition to the project would continue. On April 8, 2015, Governor Ige announced that the project was being temporarily postponed until at least April 20, 2015. Construction was set to begin again on June 24, though hundreds of protesters gathered on that day, blocking access to the construction site for the TMT. Some protesters camped on the access road to the site, while others rolled large rocks onto the road. The actions resulted in 11 arrests. The TMT company chairman stated: \\"T.M.T. will follow the process set forth by the state.\\" A revised permit was approved on September 28, 2017, by the Hawaii Board of Land and Natural Resources.09/28/17 ‚Äì Board of Land and Natural Resources Approves TMT Permit On December 2, 2015, the Hawaii State Supreme Court ruled the 2011 permit from the State of Hawaii Board of Land and Natural Resources (BLNR) was invalid ruling that due process was not followed when the Board approved the permit before the contested case hearing. The high court stated: \\"BLNR put the cart before the horse when it approved the permit before the contested case hearing,\\" and \\"Once the permit was granted, Appellants were denied the most basic element of procedural due process ‚Äì an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. Our Constitution demands more\\".Hou v. Board of the Land and Natural Resources, 363 P.3d 224, 136 Haw. 376 (2015). BLNR hearings, Court validates revised permit In March 2017, the BLNR hearing officer, retired judge Riki May Amano, finished six months of hearings in Hilo, Hawaii, taking 44 days of testimony from 71 witnesses. On July 26, 2017, Amano filed her recommendation that the Land Board grant the construction permit.Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decision and Order, In re Contested Case Hearing Re Conservation District Use Application (CDUA) HA-3568 For the Thirty Meter Telescope at the Mauna Kea Science Reserve, Ka\`ohe Mauka, Hamakua, Hawai‚Äòi TMK (3) 4-4-015:009. On September 28, 2017, the BLNR, acting on Amano's report, approved, by a vote of 5-2, a Conservation District Use Permit (CDUP) for the TMT. Numerous conditions, including the removal of three existing telescopes and an assertion that the TMT is to be the last telescope on the mountain, were attached to the permit. On October 30, 2018, the Supreme Court of Hawaii ruled 4-1, that the revised permit was acceptable, allowing construction to proceed. On July 10, 2019, Hawaii Gov. David Ige and the Thirty Meter Telescope International Observatory jointly announced that construction would begin the week of July 15, 2019. Renewed blockade shuts down all observatories On July 15, 2019, renewed protests blocked the access road, again preventing construction from commencing. On July 17, 38 protestors were arrested, all of whom were kupuna (elders) as the blockage of the access road continued. The blockade lasted 4 weeks and shut down all 12 observatories on Mauna Kea, the longest shut down in the 50 year history of the observatories. The full shut down ended when state officials brokered a deal that included building a new road around the campsite of the demonstrations and providing a complete list of vehicles accessing the road to show they are not associated with the TMT. The protests have become the latest fight for indigenous rights and become a field-defining moment for astronomy. While there is both Native Hawaiian and non native Hawaiian support for the TMT, a substantial percentage of native Hawaiians oppose the construction and see the proposal itself as a continued disregard to their basic rights. The 50 years of protests against the use of Mauna Kea has drawn into question the ethics of conducting research with telescopes on the mountain. The controversy is about more than the construction and is about generations of conflict between Native Hawaiians, the U.S. Government and private interests. The American Astronomical Society stated through their Press Officer, Rick Fienberg; \\"The Hawaiian people have numerous legitimate grievances concerning the way they‚Äôve been treated over the centuries. These grievances have simmered for many years, and when astronomers announced their intention to build a new giant telescope on Maunakea, things boiled over\\". On July 18, 2019, an online petition titled \\"Impeach Governor David Ige\\" was posted to Change.org. The petition has gathered over 25,000 signatures. The governor and others in his administration received death threats over the construction of the telescope.  Current Status  On December 19, 2019, Hawaii Governor David Ige announced that the state would reduce its law enforcement personnel on Mauna Kea. At the same time, the TMT project stated it was not prepared to start construction anytime soon. Early in 2020, TMT and the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) jointly presented their science and technical readiness to the U.S. National Academies Astro2020 panel. Chile is the site for GMT in the south and Mauna Kea is being considered as the primary site for TMT in the north. The panel will produce a series of recommendations for implementing a strategy and vision for the coming decade of U.S. Astronomy & Astrophysics frontier research and prioritize projects for future funding. In July of 2020, TMT confirmed it won‚Äôt resume construction on TMT until 2021, at the earliest. TMT continues to assess a number of factors impacting its timeline and schedule. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in TMT‚Äôs partnership working from home around the world and it continues to present a public health threat as well as travel and logistical challenges. The project is currently focused on doing the work it can safely do in its partner countries. On August 13, 2020, House Speaker Scott Saiki announced that the National Science Foundation (NSF) has initiated an informal outreach process to engage stakeholders interested in the Thirty Meter Telescope project. After listening to and considering the stakeholders‚Äô viewpoints, NSF will decide whether to initiate a formal federal environmental review process for TMT.  Community Benefit  TMT launched The Hawaii Island New Knowledge (THINK) Fund in 2014 to better prepare Hawaii Island students to master STEM and to become the workforce for higher paying science and technology jobs in Hawaii‚Äôs 21st century economy. TMT makes an annual contribution of $1 million to the Fund, which is administered by the Hawaii Community Foundation and Pauahi Foundation. To date, TMT has funded $5,536,964.15 (THINK Fund at HCF $4,254,232.94 and THINK Fund at Pauahi Foundation $1,282,731.21) for Hawai‚Äòi Island students, their families and teachers. Since 2015, THINK Fund at HCF has benefitted more than 20,000 students and 97 schools and nonprofit organizations through support of STEM education on Hawaii Island. TMT has also initiated a Workforce Pipeline Program, working with the State Department of Education, University of Hawaii Hilo, Hawaii Community College, Hawaii County government, and nonprofit organizations to strengthen STEM skills infrastructure at UH Hilo, HCC and K-12 education organizations serving low income and first-generation college attending populations. TMT is a cornerstone supporter of the Akamai Workforce Initiative, which provides college students with summer internships at observatories and other high-tech companies in Hawaii. The goal of the program is to advance Hawaii college students in STEM and increase underrepresented groups. Since launching in 2003, more than 350 college students have participated in the Akamai program and at least 150 alumni are now working in science and technology jobs, with nearly two-thirds of them working in Hawaii and contributing to the local STEM workforce. Akamai accepts college students from Hawaii (80% graduated from a Hawaii high school or were born in Hawaii), and a key objective is to increase the participation of underrepresented and underserved populations in STEM. So far, the Akamai Workforce Initiative alumni demographics include 36% women, 25% Native Hawaiian, and 47% underrepresented minorities.

The Sotho-Tswana peoples are a meta-ethnicity of southern Africa and live predominantly in Botswana, South Africa, Lesotho. The group mainly consists of four clasters; Southern Sotho (Sotho), Northern Sotho (which consists of the Pedi, the Lobedu and others) and Western Sotho (the Kgalagadi and Tswana). The last group is sometimes referred to as the Eastern Sotho and consists of the Pulana, the Pai and others. The Sotho-Tswana people would have diversified into their current arrangement during the course of the 2nd millennium, but they retain a number of linguistic and cultural characteristics that distinguish them from other Bantu-speakers of southern Africa. These are features such as totemism, a pre-emptive right of men to marry their maternal cousins, and an architectural style characterized by a round hut with a conical thatch roof supported by wooden pillars on the outside. Other major distinguishing features included their dress of skin cloaks and a preference for dense and close settlements, as well as a tradition of large-scale building in stone. The area now settled by the various Sotho-Tswana groups was reached by the Bantu expansion by about AD 500. The standard theory asserts that the Sotho-Tswana are descended from a group that moved southward from the Great Lakes in a separate movement from the other Southern Bantu groups, proceeding along the western part of present- day Zimbabwe.  Ethnonym  The Sotho-Tswana ethnic group derives its name from the people who belong to the various Sotho and Tswana clans that live southern Africa. While historically, all members of the group referred to themselves as Sothos, the name is now exclusively applied to speakers of Southern Sotho who live mainly in Lesotho, and the Free State province in South Africa. While Northern Sotho, is reserved for the Pedi people (Sepedi: Bapedi) that inhabit northern South Africa, predominantly in Limpopo.  Sotho Ethnonym  According to Jules Ellenberger (1912:34), the Basotho name was derived from the name \\"Abashuntu\\" a derivate of the Nguni saying \\"uku Shunta\\" meaning \\"to make a knot\\". The then Batlokwa, who were the very first people to be called \\"Abashuntu\\", used to wear a breech cloth with three ends, one of which passed between the legs and joined the other two knot behind, this mode of dress is called the tshega/tshea. This designation, through bestowed in derision, was adopted with pride by the Batlokwa, and later by other Sotho-Tswana clans similarly clothed and is thought to be the origin of the term \\"Basotho\\".  Tswana Ethnonym  The ethnonym Batswana is thought to be antonyms that come from meaning of the Sotho-Tswana word \\"tswa\\", which means \\"to come out of\\". The name would be derived from the word \\"Ba ba tswang\\" eventually shortened to the word Batswana meaning \\"The Separatists\\" or alternatively \\"the people who cannot hold together\\". One of the chief characteristics of the Sotho-Tswana clans is the tendency to break up and hive off. Names The term Tswana can be used to refer to one of the following * All the Tswana clans residing either in Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe or South Africa * Any member of the Sotho-Tswana clans that trace their origin from Kgosi Mokgatle. * Citizen of Botswana regardless of linguistic or ethnic origin * Members of the eight major Sotho-Tswana clans as defined in the Chieftainship Act of Botswana. * Members of the Sotho-Tswana clans that reside in Botswana, South Africa that speak a standardised dialect of the Sotho- Tswana called Setswana sometimes also referred to as the Western Sotho. * Any Sotho-Tswana clan that inhabits the Kalahari Desert basin and its eastern and south-western peripheries, unless they are Kgalagari people, who are a different Sotho-Tswana group of tribes. The term Basotho can be used to refer to the following * Citizen of Lesotho regardless of linguistic or ethnic origin * Any member of the Sotho-Tswana clans that trace their origin from Kgosi Mogale * Members of the Sotho-Tswana clans that came together under the leadership of Moshoeshoe during the Difaqane. * The Sotho-Tswana clans that stay in the Free State and Lesotho that speak a standardised dialect of the Sotho-Tswana language called Sesotho and sometimes referred to as the Southern Sotho Classification In Sotho-Tswana society each member has a totem which is usually an animal, totems are inherited from the father and thus pass like an English surname. The totem animal had traditionally a status of veneration and avoidance: in particular, it was important not to eat one's totem. In modern Sotho-Tswana society this is not as strictly observed. Each morafe/sechaba had its own totem. When naming a clan the name of the founder could be used or the animal they venerate. An example is the Bahurutshe named after the founder Mohurutshe, or alternatively they can also be called Batshweneng after the tshwene (baboon) which they venerate, similarly Batlhako after the founder, or Batloung after the totem. For some clans the name of the founder and their totem are the same like the Bakwena and Bataung where the founders were named Kwena (crocodile) and Tau (lion) respectively. The question of rank and seniority is one that is very important to the Sotho- Tswana. It determines a lot from family relationships, to village matters to relationships between clans and between the different tribal groups. In a family situation the issue of rank determines when a son will undergo initiation, or receive inheritance. A further distinction is also made between the senior wife and the junior wife if a man is in a polygamous marriage. As the Sotho-Tswana lived in large villages, seniority and rank also played a part here, where the chief's homestead is situated at the centre of the village, thereafter the other citizen are grouped according to rank where the most junior members are living the furthest from the village centre. For inter and intra relationships between clans it has been a question that has occupied the Sotho-Tswana since the split that occurred between the followers of Mohurutshe and Kwena. While it is generally accepted that the Hurutshe are the senior clan, some of the other clans have disputed this, mainly the Bafokeng, Barolong and Bakgatla. The claims of the Barolong and Bakgatla has mainly been dismissed as for an example some sub clans of Bakgatla like the Bakgatla ba ga Mmakau acknowledge the Bahurutshe as senior while the Bakagatla ba ga Kgafela do not. In the case of the Barolong, the Batlhaping who are an offshoot of the Barolong acknowledge the Bahurutshe to be senior to the Barolong, while the Barolong do not. The Bafokeng maintain that their split from core Sotho-Tswana body predated the split between Mohurutshe and Kwena, and therefore they are equal in status to the Bahurutshe if not senior. These dispute over seniority and rank were driven by the quest for benefits and independence, a senior kgosi could demand a payment of tribute from a junior chief, they could also summon a junior chief or member of his clan to kgotla for a hearing. If a dispute arose between two junior chiefs the closet most senior chief to them would be invited to resolve it. Another important factor was that a senior chief or members of his clan could not be summoned to the Kgotla by a junior kgosi or clam member. An additional factor is this question of rank and seniority was that it was determined by birth and could not be changed, this means a chief born of minor status could not change his standing relative to the other chiefs. This was mainly to discourage the split up of clans into further sub-clans and to discourage the buildup of clans through conquest and warfare. An important distinction needs to be made when discussing Sotho- Tswana clans is to distinguish between the different clans and the various sub-clans below them. This means distinguishing between clans sharing the same totem like the crocodile but are distinct such as the Bapo, Bakwena, Bangwaketse and Bafokeng of Phokeng. In distinguishing between sub clans an example are the Bakgatla who separated into the Bakgatla ba Kgafela and Bakgatla ba ga Mmakau over who should lead the clan. One faction defied the usual tradition of male leaders and acknowledged the female, Mmakau, as their kgosi. Those who supported Kgafela then broke away.Andr√© Croucamp and Bea Roberts (2011) A short history of the Bakgatla ba Kafela, Totem Media (Pty)Ltd, p 1 Further offshoot from the Bakgatla are the Bakgatla ba Mmanaana, Bakgatla ba Mmakau and Bakgatla ba Motsha who all have the kgabo as their totem. The Bakgatla ba Mmakau would later give rise to Bapedi, Bakholokoe, Batlokwa, Baphuti and Basia clans If a dispute was to arise between any of the offshoot clans like the Basia and Baphiti then the Mmakau chief would be tasked with resolving it as their senior References * * *http://www.namibian.org/travel/namibia/population/tswana.htm * * *http://mphebathomuseum.org.za/?q=node/42 ","title":"Sotho-Tswana peoples"},{"id":"4266345","text":"The Filthy Thieving Bastards is an American folk/punk rock group formed in 2000 in San Francisco, California.

The character is voiced by series creator Mike Judge, and is best known for his fast-paced and nearly incomprehensible speech. Character overview Jeffrey Dexter \\"Jeff\\" Boomhauer III is the high school friend and neighbor of the characters Hank Hill, Bill Dauterive, and Dale Gribble. His first name was only spoken in the TV series during the season 13 episode, \\"Uh- Oh, Canada\\", when the Canadian woman with whom he'd switched houses for the summer said, \\"Hello, Jeff. Oh my, it's the fifteenth already?\\" His driver's license as shown in the series finale reads simply \\"Boomhauer, Jeff\\". The location of Boomhauer's house is inconsistent during the series. In the series finale, his address is shown on his driver's license as 73 Rainey Street, which would place him on the same side of the alley as Hank, Dale, and Kahn Souphanousinphone. However, in \\"Uh-oh, Canada\\", the rear of Boomhauer's house is shown to be across the alley from Dale's house, diagonally across to the right from Hank's back yard, which would place the front door of his house (and its address) on another street. Boomhauer's primary pursuits are fast cars and women. He currently drives a 1969 Dodge Coronet Super Bee; in high school, he drove a late-'60s Ford Mustang nicknamed \\"Ms. Sally\\" in which he had a lot of sex with strange women (the name being a reference to the classic Wilson Pickett song Mustang Sally) until the car was accidentally driven into the Arlen quarry by Dale, Hank and Bill while playing a prank on him (Dale did not know how to drive a manual car and confused the clutch for the brake pedal). Boomhauer spends most of his spare time drinking Alamo Beer with Hank, Dale and Bill in the alley behind Hank's house. While he enjoys his friendship with Hank, he sometimes has limited patience with Dale (whom he sharply refers to as \\"Gribble\\") and considers Bill \\"boring\\" due to his inferiority complex. Boomhauer favors animal-print bikini briefs, which have been observed a few times in the show when he's appeared without his blue jeans; he tends to overuse cologne, bragging about his Calvin Klein CK1 attracting women \\"like catnip\\". Boomhauer is a strict non-smoker who carries a lighter implicitly for emergencies or for lending. In one episode where Hank, Bill, Dale, and Boomhauer are stuck in the water because they jumped off a boat, Boomhauer states that he dyes his hair (\\"Hank's on Board\\"). According to his Texas driver's license, which is seen in the series finale, Boomhauer is 6‚Äô0‚Äù (183 cm), and 185 lbs., and has hazel eyes. Boomhauer is missing his left pinky toe, due to an accident while he was in the Order of the Straight Arrow (\\"Straight as an Arrow\\"). Boomhauer is apparently highly astute and often gives advice to his friends. He is also a frequent voice of truth, owning up to the wrongdoings of the group despite not always acting appropriately himself. Although, since his speech pattern is not understood by most people, his confessions are usually ignored. In the episode \\"A Firefighting We Will Go\\", after Hank blames the deceased Chet Elderson for causing the fire station to burn down, Boomhauer points out that Dale was the one who plugged in the malfunctioning Alamo Beer sign. However, the fire chief does not seem to understand him and decides that the blame for the fire will be placed on electrical problems, in order to leave the integrity of Chet Elderson's name intact. In another episode, he mentions that his mother wanted him to become an electrical engineer. Given the opportunity, Boomhauer will demonstrate that he is, in fact, quite cultured. In \\"Ceci N'Est Pas Une King of the Hill\\", Hank makes remarks about art that deride its modern state, provoking Boomhauer to call him ignorant, going so far as to cite Dadaism and the famed Marcel Duchamp work Fountain. He is the only character who initially understood the meaning behind Kahn's story at Buckley's funeral, and the symbolic meanings of the novel Dinner of Onions in Full Metal Dust Jacket. Three of the main characters (Hank, Dale, and Boomhauer) graduated from high school together (Bill did not complete his senior year having enlisted in the United States Army). Boomhauer was the starting quarterback for the football team, while Hank was a running back and Bill was an offensive lineman and a fullback. Dale, not being as athletic as his friends, was the towel manager. Dale referred to basketball legend Wilt Chamberlain as Boomhauer's idol in the season 11 episode serPUNt. According to Hank, Boomhauer is allergic to macadamia nuts. Boomhauer is the most modern of the four friends, and as such was first to own a cell phone. Occupation Boomhauer's occupation was not made clear throughout the series. The season 13 episode \\"To Sirloin with Love\\" reveals that Boomhauer has a Texas Ranger badge in his wallet.Alan Sepinwall 'King of the Hill' says goodbye NJ.com. Retrieved April 21, 2011. In an early episode, \\"Nine Pretty Darn Angry Men\\", season 3 episode 7, reveals that Boomhauer worked as an electrician until he was put on worker's compensation for unknown reasons, leaving open the possibility that his electrician work was a cover or predecessor to his law enforcement career. In \\"Three Coaches and a Bobby,\\" Hank and the guys run into their old high school football coach. Coach Sauers asks Boomhauer how the family is, and Boomhauer says \\"Man they're doin' fine, man. Man lil' dang old down in old Florida man, like ol' lottery winner, man, like all, just no problems, man.\\" Coach Sauers responds \\"I'm sorry to hear that.\\" It's possible that Boomhauer has a rich benefactor. During the final season of the show, it is revealed that Boomhauer's first name is Jeff (and Fox has his middle name as Dexter), and it is strongly implied that he is a Texas Ranger when he shows a Texas Ranger badge in his wallet. The style of camera usage during the scene suggests that the badge is legitimate. On the FX website that shows King of The Hill, it says that ‚ÄúBoomhauer likes Seinfeld‚Ä¶ ‚Äòdat‚Äô show about nothin‚Äô and he works in a deafening loud factory that makes barbed wire.‚Äù Trademark speech pattern Boomhauer's speech patterns are nearly incomprehensible to the untrained audience and serve as a recurring theme. He mumbles, usually quite fast, and invariably uses the words \\"dang ol'\\" as an all-purpose adjective, sometimes several times in a single sentence. He also uses the phrases \\"I tell ya what\\" and \\"man\\" frequently. His heavy Southern accent sometimes leads to misunderstandings about his mental capacity; it has been made clear that he is an intelligent person who expresses that in an inimitable way, such as a memorable occasion where the group's anger at Bill leads to Hank finding out he has the word \\"Bill\\" tattooed on his head, and Boomhauer chuckles as he says \\"life will throw you dang ol' curveball man, like dang ol' Sandy Koufax\\" (a reference to the legendary Hall of Fame pitcher who was known for the unhittable pitch Boomhauer described). In the fourth-season episode \\"Naked Ambition\\", he was admitted to a mental hospital in downtown Houston after he drifted in on the river in a tube and was found in his Speedo, sunburned, drunk, and dehydrated, while his speech pattern was misinterpreted by a police officer as incoherent babbling (in this same episode, he is seen painting a self-portrait in a highly accurate rendition of the style of Vincent van Gogh). All of the regular characters on the show understand most of what he says. In one such instance, when a furious Dale has become involved in a dangerous situation and Boomhauer begs him via megaphone to surrender, Dale snaps \\"Boomhauer, if I ever heard anyone reading a script, that was it.\\" There is a recurring joke in which Hank occasionally cannot understand Boomhauer due to extenuating circumstances such as the complexity of the vocabulary being used (i.e. \\"legalese mumbo jumbo\\"), a bad telephone connection, or an echo. Often, the closed caption texts of Boomhauer's mumblings are clearer than his spoken words. An example of a typical line of dialogue: Boomhauer's speech is satirical of \\"rednecks\\" using phrases such as \\"dang ol'\\", \\"dad gum\\" and \\"yeah, man talkin' 'bout\\" and has the cadence and style of a Cajun accent. Nevertheless, he sings clearly, as evidenced by his rendition of \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\" in Episode 113 (\\"The Bluegrass Is Always Greener\\"); this same episode reveals that he also has a talent for the banjo and the accordion. The singing was done by country star Vince Gill. Mike Judge has stated that the inspiration for Boomhauer's voice came from a message left on his answering machine by an irate viewer of Beavis & Butt-Head (who assumed the show was called ‚ÄúPorky‚Äôs Butthole‚Äù https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/photo- gallery/35977606/video/35977610/Zach-Galifianakis-Laughing-Term-Porky- Butthole-Starts-410) as well as the voice patterns of an acquaintance in Dallas and an Oklahoma City resident reciting directions over the telephone.\\"Animator Mike Judge\\" (interview). Fresh Air, 2001-02-26 (rebroadcast 2003-08-15). Retrieved 2009-05-19. The season 1 episode \\"Hank's Got the Willies\\" shows Boomhauer and the famously incomprehensible Bob Dylan conversing with one another. In \\"A Fire Fighting We Will Go\\", when a story is presented from Boomhauer's point of view, he speaks clearly while the other characters have his usual speech pattern, indicating that Boomhauer sees his speech as normal and that of his associates as difficult to understand. Early promotional spots for the series featured clips of Boomhauer speaking, intercut with text that presented the term \\"Boombonics\\" in the style of a dictionary entry, as a reference to \\"Ebonics\\" (AAVE). The word was broken down into syllables, with proper pronunciation and the definition (see gibberish). Although he only mumbles when speaking English, he is fluent in both Spanish and French. Family Boomhauer has had four relatives that have appeared on the show: his \\"Meemaw\\" (a Southern term for grandmother); his father, Dr. Boomhauer; his mother, Mrs. Boomhauer; and his sleazy, womanizer brother, Patch, voiced by Brad Pitt in his only speaking appearance (he appeared again for a split second at Luanne and Lucky's wedding). They live in Florida. Mrs. Boomhauer, Patch, and Meemaw all have the same speaking pattern as Boomhauer. Dr. Boomhauer has not been shown speaking, only through other characters paraphrasing what he may have said. He is the uncle of Patch's son, Patrick Boomhauer. Romantic life Boomhauer's typical romantic life included one- night stands with several young women. Peggy Hill once mentions (likely in jest) his longest relationship was a three-day weekend. Occasionally, he had girlfriends that he dated for more than sex. When a woman breaks up with him, he is notably devastated. In the episode \\"Uh-Oh, Canada\\", Boomhauer moves to Guelph, Ontario and has a 3-month relationship with a French-Canadian woman. When demonstrating his abilities with women to Bobby, he was shown to lurk in a discount shoe store and hit on every women he sees, suggesting he is either not as good with women as his friends think or that he is some variety of pick-up artist.

Luminary means, source of light. The sun and moon, being the most abundant sources of light to the inhabitants of Earth are known as luminaries. The astrological significance warrants the classification of the Sun and Moon separately from the planets, in that the Sun and Moon have to do with Man's spiritual consciousness, while the planetary influences operate through the physical mechanism. The Moon is a luminary in the biblical sense that it affords to Man \\"light by night\\". Some early, Pre-Newtonian astronomers to observe and study luminaries include Pythagoras, Aristotle, Claudius Ptolemy, al-Khwarizmi, Nicolaus Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Galileo Galilei, and Johannes Kepler.  Origins  The Sun and Moon were considered the rulers of day, and night, in accordance with the doctrine of astrology of sect: diurnal (or daytime) planets, which were ruled by the Sun, and nocturnal (or nighttime) planets, which were ruled by the Moon. The Sun was also the sect ruler‚Äîor the luminary of sect for all charts of events and individuals born in the daytime, when the Sun was over the horizon; and the Moon was the sect ruler or luminary of sect for night charts, when the Sun was below the horizon. Ancient astrologers divided all astrological factors into day and night groups: essential dignities, Arabian Parts (or \\"Lots\\") and all planetary characteristics. Even each of the Starry planets themselves \\"belonged\\" to one luminary or the other. The luminary \\"in charge\\" of any given chart was called the luminary of sect. (See sect.) The luminaries can be found in the Bible: :And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: He made the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. (Genesis 1:16-18, King James Version) In modern Western astrology, the importance of the Moon and the Sun has even come to outweigh all the other celestial factors. In the interpretation of chart data. In Hindu astrology, the Moon (and the Ascendant) have that distinction. Early Beliefs of the Sun and Moon In the early history of all people we find the Sun and Moon regarded as human beings, connected with the daily life of mankind, and influencing in some mysterious way man's existence, and controlling his/her destiny. We find the luminaries alluded to as ancestors, heroes, and benefactors, who, after a life of usefulness on this earth, were transported to the heavens, where they continue to look down on, and, in a measure, rule over earthly affairs. The basis of mythology is the worship of the solar great father, and the lunar great mother. For centuries, people have worshiped and regarded the luminaries as objects of higher powers. Oftentimes, the sun and moon have been considered as opposite sexes. For example, the sun being \\"the father\\" and the moon being \\"the mother\\". In Australia, the Moon was considered to be a man, the Sun a woman, who appears at dawn in a coat of red kangaroo skins. Shakespeare speaks of the Moon as \\"she,\\" while in Peru, the moon was regarded as a mother who was both sister and wife of the Sun. The sex of each has been disputed and thought of differently over the centuries. This confusion in the sex, ascribed to the Sun and Moon by different nations, may have arisen from the fact that the day is mild and friendly, hence the Sun which rules the day would properly be considered feminine, while the Moon which rules the chill and stern night might appropriately be regarded as a man. On the contrary, in equatorial regions, the day is forbidding and burning, while the night is mild and pleasant. Applying these analogies, it appears that the sex of the Sun and Moon would, by some tribes, be the reverse of those ascribed to them by others, climatic conditions being responsible for the confusion. Also many cultures believe the sun and moon to be husband and wife or brother and sister. From the conception that the Sun and Moon were husband and wife many legends concerning them were created, chief among these being the old Persian belief that the stars were the children of the Sun and Moon. As common with many marriages it was also thought that the sun and moons marriage was an uneasy one. There are many legends of the sun and moon that relate their disputes and marital troubles, for mythology reveals that as husband and wife the Sun and Moon did not live happily together, some of these explaining the reason of seasons and weather. The myths and thoughts of the relationship between the sun and moon and their role in the universe are high in quantity. Correlations and connections can be made with some of these beliefs but oftentimes many disagree with others. Luminaries in Medicine In early modern England, the medical effects of the sun and the moon had been traditionally explained by a vast symbolic system of \\"analogies, correspondences, and relations among apparently discrete elements in man and the universe,\\" which had its conceptual origins in the works of Aristotle, Ptolemy, and Galen. The ultimate causes of planetary emanations had been considered \\"occult,\\" an Aristotelian and early modern term utilized when distinguishing \\"qualities which were evident to the senses from those which were hidden\\" After the Restoration, many physicians attempted to rid the natural world of occult causes and to explain invisible forces like solar and lunar emanations via mechanical, chemical, and mathematical systems. To explain the medical effects of the luminaries, the English physicians Richard Mead (1673-1754) and James Gibbs (d. 1724) utilized iatromechanism, which regarded the body as a Cartesian machine, conforming in its functions to mechanical laws. Physiological phenomena could thus be explained in terms of physics. Richard Mead subsequently applied Newton's gravitational theories to Pitcairne's hydraulic iatromechanism and astrological medicine. In De imperio solis ac lunae in corpora humana et morbis inde oriundis [A treatise concerning the influence of the sun and moon on human bodies and the diseases thereby produced] (1704), Mead stressed the mechanical effects of solar and lunar emanations, especially the gravitational effects of the tides, on the pressure of vessels and fluids within the human body.

After the interim Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert communicated with Putin, the Israeli position somewhat softened.Israel softens Russia criticism over Hamas talks Washington Post, 28 February 2006. In an interview in Russian newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta published on 13 February 2006, Mashal said that Hamas would temporarily stop armed struggle against Israel if it recognized the \\"1967 borders\\" and withdrew itself from all \\"Palestinian territories\\" (including the West Bank and East Jerusalem). He refused to acknowledge the Road map for peace, adopted by the Quartet in June 2003, \\"since nobody respects it\\". The Road map projected the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in 2005. Following Hamas' victory in January 2006, the EU announced that future aid to the Palestinians is tied to \\"Three Principles\\" outlined by the international community: *Hamas must renounce violence *Hamas must recognize Israel's right to exist *Hamas must express clear support for the Middle East peace process, as outlined in the Oslo accords. During the talks in March 2006, Lavrov called on the Hamas to comply with the earlier commitments signed by the PLO, and reiterated these three requirements but Hamas refused.land-for-peace arab proposal Daily Star On 7 March, Russia expressed hope that Hamas would consider supporting the Road map for peace and peace plan proposed by Saudi Arabia, but it did not materialize. Israeli spokesman stated: \\"They (Hamas) did not accept any of those principles ... therefore I don't know where they (Russia) draw their optimism from Hamas changing its ways.\\"Russia hopeful Hamas will support peace road map (Reuters) 7 March 2006 President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian National Authority said that he would oppose the creation of a Palestinian state with temporary borders and further Israel's unilateral withdrawals. The invitation and the talks have caused controversy wherein Russia's intentions in changing its views towards the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict were questioned in the West. Russian technical, military, and diplomatic aid to Iran Currently, there are concerns that Israel will attack Iran pre-emptively because the nuclear program of Iran could be used eventually to produce nuclear weapons.Israel denies planning Iran nuclear attack, U.K. newspaper reports Israel intends to strike up to three targets in Iran, The Associated Press, 7 January 2007Tom Baldwin, James Hider, Francis Elliott, US fears Israeli strike against Iran over latest nuclear claim, The Times, 8 November 2007. Russia provides technical assistance to Iran's nuclear program, supplies it with weapons, and gives it diplomatic support at the United Nations.Herb Keinon, \\"Jerusalem sees Russian interests behind arms sales to Damascus, The Jerusalem Post, 20 August 2007 In January 2007, Israeli officials voiced \\"extreme concern\\" over Russia's sale of advanced anti-aircraft missiles to Iran. They warned: \\"We hope they understand that this is a threat that could come back to them as well.\\"Yaakov Katz and Herb Keinon, Israel warns Russia on Iran arms sale, Jerusalem Post, 16 January 2007 Before Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's trip to Russia, Israel's Cabinet voted to recognize Russia's claim to Sergei's Courtyard in central Jerusalem. Russia laid claim to the site, named for the son of a Russian czar, on behalf of the Russian Orthodox Church. In an overture before the trip, Israel's Cabinet voted to recognize Russia's claim to property in Jerusalem. Russia laid claim to the site, named for the son of a Russian czar, on behalf of the Russian Orthodox Church. Olmert said he would urge Moscow not to sell sophisticated weapons to Israel's enemies. Iran is interested in buying anti-aircraft missiles that could cripple any military strike against its nuclear program. Israel is also afraid Moscow would sell Syria the same missile defense system. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has frequently called for Israel's destruction, and Israel suspects he means to carry out that objective by developing nuclear bombs with the help of a Russian-built nuclear power plant. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Iran says it plans to buy from Russia advanced S-300 anti- aircraft missiles that could detect aircraft sent to destroy its nuclear facilities. Syria, which backs Hezbollah guerrillas who battled Israel in Lebanon in 2006, reportedly has asked to buy them, too. Russia has not confirmed the reports. But recently, Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said his government was prepared to sell Syria arms with a \\"defensive character.\\" Israel claims Russian missiles sold to Syria made their way into the Hezbollah's hands in the 2006 war, though it has not accused Russia of directly arming the guerrilla group. After four decades of Cold War animosity, ties between Moscow and Israel improved significantly after the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991. Israel is also home to more than 1 million Soviet emigres. But Moscow's position on Iran and arms sales to Syria have seemingly strained ties, as did Israeli weapons sales to Georgia. In reality, while Russia attacked Georgia in August 2008, Russians had access to the communication secrets of the Israeli drones sold to Georgia before, suggesting pre-planned military cooperation between IL-RU. Contacts with Hezbollah Russian intelligence agencies have a history of contacts with Lebanese Shia organizations, such as Amal Movement and Hezbollah Russian-made anti-tank weapons played significant role in Hezbollah operations against Israel Defense Forces during the 2006 Lebanon War. It was claimed that \\"Russian Fajr-1 and Fajr-3 rockets, Russian 9M113 Konkurs antitank missiles and Kornet antitank rockets\\"Russian Footprints ‚Äì by Ion Mihai Pacepa, National Review Online, 24 August 2006 have been supplied to Hezbollah through Syria and Iran Muslim GRU detachments from Chechnya were transferred to Lebanon independently of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon to guard the Russian military engineers (sent to Lebanon to restore the damaged roads) and \\"to improve Moscow's image in the Arab and Muslim world\\". List of international terror groups assembled by Russia Russian list of international terrorism published in the official daily Rossiyskaya Gazeta on 28 July 2006 contained seventeen terror groups. It included al-Qaeda, Taliban, Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and Egypt's banned Muslim Brotherhood, as well as groups linked to separatist militants in Chechnya and Islamic radicals in Central Asia but omitted both Hamas and Hezbollah. Yury Sapunov, the top official of Russian Federal Security Service in charge of fighting international terrorism, said that the list \\"Includes only those organizations which represent the greatest threat to the security of our country.\\" Russian military and diplomatic relations with Israel Russian President Vladimir Putin met with leaders of both Israel and the Palestinian National Authority during a visit to the region in June 2012. During the visit, one prominent Israeli host was the country's foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman, known for his popularity amongst the large community of Russian-Israelis Arab commentators were also quick to point out how this visit, which carried with it indications of closer Russian-Israeli cooperation in energy and military technology, could usher in a break in a perceived, long-standing Arab-Russian alliance.

Life In the Chapel of St Jean, Tr√©boul, 1954, Royal Scottish Academy. A fine example of Redpath's use of a restrained palette with splashes of vibrant colour. Redpath's father was a tweed designer in the Scottish Borders. She saw a connection between his use of colour and her own. \\"I do with a spot of red or yellow in a harmony of grey, what my father did in his tweed.\\" The Redpaths moved from Galashiels to Hawick when Anne was about six. After Hawick High School, she went to Edinburgh College of Art in 1913. Post-graduate study led to a scholarship which allowed her to travel on the Continent in 1919, visiting Bruges, Paris, Florence and Siena. The following year, 1920, she married James Michie, an architect, and they went to live in Pas-de-Calais where her first two sons were born; the eldest of whom is the painter and sculptor Alastair Michie. In 1924, they moved to the South of France, and in 1928, had a third son: now David Michie the artist. In 1934, she returned to Hawick. Redpath was soon exhibiting in Edinburgh, and was president of the Scottish Society of Women Artists from 1944 to 1947. The Royal Scottish Academy admitted her as an associate in 1947, and in 1952, she became the first woman painter Academician (the sculptor Phyllis Bone, elected in 1944, was the first female Academician). In 1955, she was made an OBE for her work as \\"Artist\\" and \\"Member of the Board of Management of the Edinburgh College of Art\\". With her children grown up, and an active involvement in Edinburgh art circles, she moved to live in town at the end of the 1940s. In the 1950s and early 1960s, she also travelled in Europe, painting in Spain, the Canary Islands, Corsica, Brittany, Venice and elsewhere. There is a commemorative plaque on the house where she lived and entertained at 7 London Street, Edinburgh. Painting The Indian Rug, 1942, National Gallery of Scotland. The poppy Field, circa 1963, Tate Gallery. A typical example of Redpath's later work featuring flowers. Redpath is probably best known for her still lifes where familiar household objects - a chair, a cup - are made into a \\"two-dimensional\\" design. She used textiles - a printed tablecloth, a spotted scarf - to add pattern within the pattern. The Indian Rug, also known as Red Shoes, is a good example of this group of paintings. Matisse's influence is clear in these bold, flat- surfaced interior arrangements. Critics see another influence in the tabletops tilted to suit the design, not conventional perspective: that of the medieval Sienese paintings which impressed her on her first trip abroad. At this time she first discovered the richness of Catholic imagery (unfamiliar to a young woman brought up as a Scottish Protestant), a theme explored in her later work. She and a group of her contemporaries are sometimes called The Edinburgh School. They may be seen as the \\"heirs\\" of the Scottish Colourists: Redpath's The Orange Chair, for example, suggests the Colourist heritage. During her years in France (1920‚Äì1933), Redpath's painting was limited by family commitments, but she produced enough for exhibitions in 1921 and 1928. She also decorated furniture with bright flower and bird patterns. (See Still Life with Painted Chest) Later there would be many paintings of flowers: in vases, or growing abundant in the wild. (The Poppy Field) Redpath became heavily influenced by the likes of Matisse and Bonnard. On her return to Scotland in 1934, she started to sketch the countryside round Hawick, and painted landscapes with a more muted look than much of her work: Frosty Morning, Trow Mill (1936), for example. In the early 1940s The Indian Rug showed that she was developing the freer, individual approach described above. Other works representing this style include The Mantelpiece and Still Life with Table. Her circa 1943 self-portrait was solicited by Ruth Borchard, who created a collection of 100 self-portraits of modern British artists. Redpath sent Borchard the painting in 1964, taking care to mark the date as 1943 because she did not want people to think she had painted herself as 20 years younger. A friend who traveled to Spain with Redpath in 1951 described her appearance: \\"Anne looked like Queen Victoria; black hair correctly parted in the centre and bun behind, but she wore colours!\\" The formal severity of the portrait is similarly mitigated by touches of colour in the same way as her father had introduced threads of vivid colour in his otherwise sober tweeds. Window in Menton, painted in 1948, a favourite of Redpath's, is also a richly-textured surface with familiar elements - flowers, chair, printed wallpaper - but here a seated woman looks towards an open full-length window. The view is of a hillside patterned with houses and trees. Redpath painted more hillsides, like Les Tourettes (1962), as she travelled in the later years of her life, but her interest was still often interior. Her Courtyard in Venice (1964) is another view from inside looking outwards. Some later works reflect religious influences, especially paintings of altars in The Chapel of St Jean - Treboul (1954) andVenetian Altar. These are highly regarded by commentators who admire her mature work even more than the pieces from the 1940s. Exhibitions Portland Gallery held a large exhibition of works by Redpath in July 2008.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, Texas Rangers, Boston Red Sox, Miami Marlins, Arizona Diamondbacks, Detroit Tigers, and Toronto Blue Jays. The 14 characters in his surname make it longest in Major League Baseball history. Saltalamacchia is Italian for \\"jump over\\" (salta) \\"the thicket\\" (la macchia- Southern Italy dialect for a kind of tall shrub). His nickname is Salty. Background Born in West Palm Beach, Florida, Saltalamacchia attended Royal Palm Beach High School in Royal Palm Beach, Florida, graduating in 2003. Saltalamacchia attended high school along with future Texas Rangers teammate Kason Gabbard, and the two were friends growing up. A standout, Saltalamacchia was a member of Team Florida USA and won gold with the team in the 2001 Junior Olympics. Professional career Atlanta Braves The Atlanta Braves selected Saltalamacchia in the first round (36 overall) of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft. In 2006, Saltalamacchia had a breakout season for the Class A Myrtle Beach Pelicans, where the switch-hitting slugger hit .314 with 35 doubles, 19 home runs, and 81 runs batted in (RBIs) in 129 games. Saltalamacchia ranked 18th in Baseball America top 100 prospects in 2006, and 36th the following year. Atlanta Braves in 2007 In the 2007 season, Saltalamacchia started at catcher for the Double-A Mississippi Braves. In 22 games played, he belted 7 home runs with a batting average of .373. On his 22nd birthday, he was called up to Atlanta to replace Brayan Pe√±a on the roster and to fill in for Brian McCann, who re-injured his finger on May 1, 2007. Saltalamacchia's call-up made him the new record-holder of the longest surname in Major League Baseball history, at 14 letters, breaking the record set by William Van Landingham (or tying it, depending on whether one counts the space in the latter's surname). On May 6, 2007, Saltalamacchia had the first hit of his major league career in the sixth inning against the Los Angeles Dodgers. In the seventh inning, with two outs and two men on base, Saltalamacchia got his first RBI, which also drove in the winning run for the Braves. On May 27, 2007, Saltalamacchia hit his first major league home run, a solo shot off Cole Hamels of the Philadelphia Phillies. On June 26 in a start at first base, Saltalamacchia had his first multi-home run game. Both blasts came batting right-handed off Washington Nationals pitcher Mike Bacsik. Because Saltalamacchia was \\"blocked\\" (by McCann, who was recently signed to a large contract with Atlanta), he was the subject of much trade speculation within baseball, and was traded to the Texas Rangers on July 31, 2007, with Elvis Andrus, Neftal√≠ Feliz, Matt Harrison, and Beau Jones for first baseman Mark Teixeira and reliever Ron Mahay. In 2007, Saltalamacchia batted .284 with 4 home runs and 12 RBIs in 47 games with Atlanta. Texas Rangers Upon joining the Rangers after being traded Saltalamacchia changed his number to 25. In his first game with the Rangers on August 1, 2007, Saltalamacchia started at first base and drove in two runs. On August 22, 2007, Saltalamacchia had two home runs and seven RBIs in the historic 30‚Äì3 rout of the Baltimore Orioles. In 46 games with the Rangers in 2007, Saltamacchia batted .251, collecting seven home runs and 21 RBIs. On March 26, 2008, Saltalamacchia lost the starting catching job to Gerald Laird, and the Rangers chose to send him down to the minors to catch every day instead of sitting as the backup. However, Saltalamacchia was soon called up on April 25, 2008. Texas Rangers in 2009 After the Rangers signed free agent Andruw Jones, Saltalamacchia gave up his number 25 to Jones and selected the number 21.http://rangersblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2009/02/saltalamacchia-giving- up-jersey-number.html On April 25, 2009, Saltalamacchia struck out in his 28th consecutive game played, setting a new MLB strikeout streak record for a position player (pitcher Bill Stoneman holds the all-time record with 37 games). Saltalamacchia's streak started on July 23, 2008. Saltalamacchia suffered a shoulder injury on August 15, 2009 and was placed on the disabled list. Saltalamacchia was placed on the disabled list after the second game of the 2010 season. On April 27, 2010, Saltalamacchia was removed from the DL and assigned to the Oklahoma City RedHawks. He has struggled with throwing the ball back to the pitcher. Boston Red Sox Saltalamacchia was traded to the Boston Red Sox just before the Major League Baseball trading deadline on July 31, 2010. The Rangers received minor league prospects Chris McGuiness, Rom√°n M√©ndez, a player to be named later (Michael Thomas), and cash. He reported to the Pawtucket Red Sox of the Class AAA International League. Saltalamacchia was called up on August 11 after Kevin Cash went on the disabled list needing surgery in his left thumb, in September 2010. In the 2011 season, Saltalamacchia was slated at the beginning of the year to be Boston's primary catcher with veteran Jason Varitek taking the role as the backup. Out of the gate, he struggled defensively and showed weakness in the batter's box. However, he showed improvement at the plate as the season progressed, hitting .327 in the month of June. Despite his low average, Saltalamacchia showed decent power and finished out the year hitting .235/.288/.450 with 16 HR, and 56 RBIs in 103 games played. Boston Red Sox in 2012 On January 15, 2012, Saltalamacchia avoided arbitration by signing a one-year, non-guaranteed contract worth $2.5 million with the Sox to be their starting catcher. Kelly Shoppach was his backup until being traded, making Ryan Lavarnway his backup catcher. On May 26, 2012, with one out in the ninth inning, Saltalamacchia hit a 2-run walk-off home run off of Fernando Rodney to beat the Tampa Bay Rays. As the season progressed, Saltalamacchia was moved to 1st base as manager Bobby Valentine gave Ryan Lavarnway a look as the team's starting catcher. Saltalamacchia finished the year batting .222/.288/.454 with 25 HR, and 59 RBIs in a career high 121 games played. Saltalamacchia was the starting catcher in 2013 for the Red Sox, and David Ross and Ryan Lavarnway were his backups. He went 1-2 with 3 walks and a double on Opening Day against the Yankees. On October 13, 2013, Saltlamacchia hit a walk-off single, driving in Jonny Gomes to beat the Detroit Tigers 6-5 in the second game of the 2013 ALCS. Saltalamacchia was benched for the final three games of the 2013 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals in favor of David Ross following a series of defensive errors. Saltalamacchia appeared in 121 games in 2013 and hit .273/338/.466 with 14 home runs, 65 RBIs, 68 runs and 40 doubles, becoming the thirteenth different catcher ever to have 40 doubles in a season. Following the 2013 season, the Red Sox declined to offer Saltalamacchia a qualifying offer, making him an unrestricted free agent. Miami Marlins On December 3, 2013, Saltalamacchia agreed to a three-year, $21 million contract with the Miami Marlins. The deal was finalized on December 6. He was designated for assignment by the Marlins on April 27, 2015, and released on May 5. Arizona Diamondbacks Arizona Diamondbacks in 2015 On May 7, Saltalamacchia signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks. After reporting to extended spring training and then playing for the Reno Aces for a week, the Diamondbacks promoted him to the major leagues to replace Tuffy Gosewisch, who suffered a season-ending knee injury, as their starting catcher. Detroit Tigers On December 6, 2015, Saltalamacchia signed a one-year major league contract with the Detroit Tigers for the league minimum salary. The Miami Marlins are still paying the bulk of Saltalamacchia's existing contract.

Johann Gottfried M√ºthel (January 17, 1728 - July 14, 1788) was a German composer and noted keyboard virtuoso. Along with C.P.E. Bach, he represented the Sturm und Drang style of composition. As far as is known, he was the first to use the term fortepiano in a published work, in the title of his Duetto f√ºr 2 Clavier, 2 Fl√ºgel, oder 2 Fortepiano (1771), which reflects the rising popularity of the instrument at that time. Biography He was born in M√∂lln in the Duchy of Lauenburg, the fifth of nine children. His father was Christian Caspar, an organist and friend of Georg Philipp Telemann. He studied music with his father, and later Johann Paul Kunzen in L√ºbeck. When only 19 years of age, he became a court organist and harpsichordist for Duke Christian Ludwig II of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, in Schwerin. In 1750 he was given leave to become the student of Bach in Leipzig. He became Bach's last pupil, beginning study only three months before the master's death. In that time, he notated a number of the blind composer's final works, including parts of the Orgelb√ºchlein. According to Bach's biographer Philipp Spitta, he was present at Bach's deathbed, and took over his duties for nine weeks. Subsequently, M√ºthel took lessons from Johann Christoph Altnickol, who had also been living and studying with Bach. Afterwards he spent a good deal of time on travel, and he met other composers, the most notable of whom was C.P.E. Bach (then residing at the court of Frederick II of Prussia at Potsdam), with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship and correspondence. In 1751 M√ºthel returned to the ducal court, where he remained for two more years, eventually being replaced by his younger brother. Two years later he moved to Riga (now in Latvia, then part of the Russian Empire), where one of his brothers had moved. It was here that he published his first works, in 1756; most of his compositions remained in manuscript during his lifetime. At first he worked as a conductor for a private orchestra, before being appointed organist at St. Peter's Church, which he served from 1767 until 1788, when he died in nearby Bienenhof. Influence Riga was far from the established musical centers of Europe; but despite this handicap, and the fact that he saw few of his pieces printed, he gained praise from several competent judges for his virtuosity. The English music historian Charles Burney, who mentioned him several times in his writings, held him in high esteem. The German Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart wrote of his harpsichord skill that \\"connoisseurs that have heard him cannot praise enough the quickness, correctness and lightness with which he conquers mountains of difficulties.\\"http://www.harpsichord- sd.com/clavichord/muethel.html . Liner notes by Peter Reidemeister. Accessed on May 12, 2006 He is believed to have been a skilled improviser on the keyboard. His preference seems to have been for playing the clavichord. Compositions Even now, some of the works which M√ºthel is known to have produced have not yet been released in modern editions. None of his pieces for organ achieved publication in his lifetime, nor were any for non-keyboard instruments. For keyboard His known works include a total of seven concerti, nine sonatas, and numerous other shorter pieces. * Concerto for solo Harpsichord in B flat major (printed 1767) * Concerto for Harpsichord and strings in C minor (printed 1767) * Concerto for Harpsichord and strings in D minor (printed 1767) * Concerto for Harpsichord and strings in D major * Concerto for Harpsichord and strings in G major * Concerto for Harpsichord and strings in B-flat major * Concerto for Harpsichord and strings in B-flat major (doubtful attribution) * Sonata No. 1 in F major (printed in 1756) * Sonata No. 2 in G major (printed in 1756) * Sonata No. 3 in C major (printed in 1756) * Duetto f√ºr 2 Clavier, 2 Fl√ºgel, oder 2 Fortepiano (printed in 1771) * Duetto in E-flat major (printed in 1771) * Arioso with 12 Variations, No. 1 in G major (printed in 1756) * Arioso with 12 Variations, No. 2 in C minor (printed in 1756) * 12 Variations for Clavichord * Minuet with 6 variations * Tempo di Minuetto con Variazioni * Fantasy in F major for Organ * Two Fantasies in E-flat major for Organ * Fantasy in G minor for Organ * Fantasy in G major for Organ For voice * 45 Choice Odes and Songs from Various Poets (45 Auserlesene Oden und Lieder von verschiedenen Dichtern) (printed in 1759) * A cantata For other instruments * Concerto for Bassoon in C major * Concerto for 2 Bassoons in E-flat major * Sonata in D major for Flute and Basso Continuo Trivia M√ºthel is greatly talked about in the short story \\"Early Music\\" by Jeffrey Eugenides.

He is a paranormal investigator of unidentified flying objects, having researched many sightings and written critiques of the hypothesis that UFOs are alien spacecraft. In addition to UFOs, his writings cover topics such as Christianity, academic feminism, the scientific theory of evolution, and creationism. He is the author of six books. Sheaffer wrote for Skeptical Inquirer (where he contributed the regular \\"Psychic Vibrations\\" column), 1977‚Äì 2017, Fate Magazine, and Spaceflight. He was a founding member (with Philip J. Klass and James Oberg) of the UFO Subcommittee of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, and is a fellow of that organization.CSI Fellows and Staff retrieved 12 October 2014. He is a graduate of Northwestern University and a member of Mensa. UFO investigation Sheaffer has frequently been quoted in the news media regarding UFOs and psychic predictions.James Barron, \\"Looking Backward and Forward\\", The New York Times January 1, 1993. Retrieved 12 October 2014.\\"Predictions for a Lousy Year Ahead\\", San Jose Mercury News January 1, 1989. Retrieved 24 July 2009. On July 7, 2010 a flight crew preparing to land in Hangzhou's Xiaoshan Airport in China reported an UFO. As a precaution 18 flights were \\"delayed or redirected\\". Sheaffer's article in Skeptical Inquirer magazine's November/December 2010 issue is a discussion of how photographs and videos are used. \\"Reporters want an exciting story, and UFOlogists want to win converts. They will typically grab onto any photo or video that is supposed to represent the object and report as fact practically any claim that is made regardless of its source or veracity.\\" In the case of the Xiaoshan Airport, most of the footage shown was actually taken a year previous to the July 2010 incident. Ufologist Kevin D. Randle was interviewed by Sheaffer for Skeptical Inquirer magazine's January/February 2011 issue: looking to \\"explore their points of agreement and disagreement, finding that Randle gives more weight to 'eyewitness testimony' than skeptics typically do.\\" Interviewed by the Toronto Sun newspaper December 20, 2010, Sheaffer is asked by columnist Thane Burnett to debate UFO enthusiast Chris Rutkowski to \\"debate the known realities\\". When asked \\"Is it reasonable to conclude a UFO ‚Äì something that was beyond our comprehension and understanding ‚Äì has ever crashed on Earth?\\" Sheaffer replies \\"No, because no one has ever produced any proof of any extraterrestrial technology being retrieved, despite many claims. Talk is cheap, show us the evidence.\\" On the August 4, 2012 episode of the Skeptic Zone podcast, Sheaffer was interviewed by Richard Saunders. When asked about the UFO phenomenon, Sheaffer said, \\"The Fortean researcher Hilary Evans has said that the UFO mythos looked at in its fullness is the richest set of contemporary myth when you consider all that has come from it.... The Men in Black, saucer crashes, Roswell, aliens, alien abductions, alien hybrids, it just goes on and on from there. It's not just something narrow like Bigfoot.... UFOs have evolved into this enormous richness as a social phenomenon.\\" He also discussed the fallacy of the trained observer. \\"Pilots, surprisingly, make relatively poor observers, when they're hit with some surprise, unusual stimulus. Their thought is not, 'Gee let me analyze what that thing is.' Their thought is, 'I'm going to collide with that thing, I'd better go into a bank,' etc.\\" On January 10, 2014, a series called Close Encounters debuted on the Discovery Canada channel. The episode recounted a UFO incident that happened at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana on March 24, 1967. As Sheaffer summarizes it on his blog, \\"A bright, glowing orange UFO is allegedly seen over the base by security men, and then the Oscar Flight missiles were said to start going off-line, one by one.\\" Sheaffer's investigation concluded that what the base security men probably saw was the planet Mars. \\"Whenever witnesses report a bright object in the sky that is red or orange, the first thing to check is whether Mars might have been the culprit.... Mars was only about 3 weeks away from its opposition of April 15, 1967, when it would be directly opposite the sun, and at its maximum brightness.\\" As for the base's missiles going off- line, Sheaffer could find no evidence or paper trail to support that, only the claim of (then) Air Force Lieutenant Robert Salas. Noted UFO researcher Robert Hastings responded to Sheaffer's investigation by dismissing the possibility that the glowing object was Mars. Former SAC missile crew commander Tim Hebert goes further than Sheaffer, stating on his blog \\"At this point in time there is no supporting documentation or statements from security personnel corroborating the claims for what, if anything, was observed out in the field.\\" Called the \\"world's top expert on the subject of unidentified flying objects and claims of extraterrestrials\\" by paranormal investigator Ben Radford in a review of Sheaffer's book Bad UFOs: Critical Thinking About UFO Claims. Radford states that Sheaffer has \\"encyclopedic knowledge\\" on \\"diverse topics\\" and uses it in the book. The book is ten chapters long and almost 300 pages, he covers '\\"classic\\"' as well as \\"high profiles reports and sightings (that are) decades old\\". Radford writes that when a UFO claim has been debunked clearly and completely they rarely update their writings or \\"admit their mistakes... Sheaffer performs a huge... public service... keeping his audience current on old and new claims\\". Robert Sheaffer presenting at the IIG awards 2012 Conspiracy theories In an interview by Karen Stollznow on Point of Inquiry for May 16, 2011, Sheaffer was asked, \\"Have any conspiracy theories ever turned out to be correct, or is a 'true conspiracy theory' really something else?\\" He replied, \\"Conspiracies occur all the time. Organized crime is a conspiracy... there was a conspiracy to kill President Lincoln.... Real conspiracies do exist but not grand conspiracies [in which] The Masons are planning this, or there's always some shadowy group that you can't really point to or say who's involved.\\" Climate change Sheaffer is skeptical of global climate change, writing in 2008 that, \\"when a prominent theory is opposed by scientists of the caliber of Richard Lindzen of MIT, Reid Bryson of the University of Wisconsin, Freeman Dyson of the Institute for Advanced Study, and many others, it is disingenuous to speak of a 'consensus.'\\" And concludes, \\"given that unknown factors have caused previous climate changes, how can we be certain that these same unknown factors are not active today?\\" Feminism Sheaffer has been an outspoken critic of contemporary feminism since the late 1980s. His article, \\"Feminism, the Noble Lie\\" was published in the Spring 1995 issue of Free Inquiry Magazine. In it, he criticizes feminist crusades against \\"satanic cults\\", and the use of \\"repressed memories\\" to uncover supposed \\"forgotten incest\\". On his debunker blog, Sheaffer calls modern (post-1960s) feminism a con, and compares it to astrology and parapsychology in its lack of academic peer review, poor scholarship, and prevalence of false and inaccurate information and claims. Sheaffer states that anyone who criticizes the \\"rampant misinformation\\" that is prevalent in modern feminism, including feminist scholars such as Christina Hoff Sommers, Camille Paglia, and others, are labeled \\"enemies of women\\" and drummed out of the feminist movement. On his website, Sheaffer summarizes his criticism of feminism: Christianity Sheaffer has been a vocal critic of creationism, or the belief that God or a Supreme Being created the universe and humanity, and that the Biblical book of Genesis is an accurate account of creation: \\"Creationists claim they are proving the Genesis account of Creation 'scientifically', but to do so they must violate scientific methodology willy- nilly...so-called 'Scientific Creationism' is just new, modern packaging for that 'Old-Time Religion.'\\" In his 1991 book The Making of the Messiah, Sheaffer argues that Christianity developed \\"from the envious anger of the lower classes\\" towards \\"Roman power and wealth.\\" Sheaffer disputes the divinity of Jesus Christ, arguing that his mother Mary was not a virgin, but an adulteress, and that Jesus was an illegitimate child. Sheaffer writes that Christ's claim to operate under a \\"higher law\\" came from his resentment at being \\"despised and rejected\\" in Jewish society due to the circumstances of his birth. Sheaffer argues that Jesus was not crucified, nor did the resurrection take place, but that the story of the Romans crucifying Jesus was created to win converts among those who resented Roman power and rule across their empire. Booklist, while praising Sheaffer for writing a \\"stern critique\\" of the rise of Christianity, also notes that \\"In his eagerness to prove his point, Sheaffer places more value in the documents contradicting the Gospels than in the Gospels themselves, though clearly both sources contain large amounts of propaganda for their respective sides.\\" Other writings In his book, Resentment Against Achievement: Understanding The Assault Upon Ability, Sheaffer describes two systems of morality, the pride of achievement, and the resentment sometimes felt by those who have not achieved success toward those who have. Sheaffer contends that resentment towards achievement is seen in \\"a hostile suspicion towards \\"greedy capitalists\\", who are depicted as exploiters rather than what they really are - the creators of jobs and wealth...We see it in a surly animosity towards managers and owners, who are reviled as enemies...Instead of seeing employers as powerful economic allies, the resentful scorn their values, then blame the \\"system\\" for them not being able to find work.\\" He argues that poverty among the lower classes is an inevitable consequence of their flawed values, which emphasize hatred and jealously towards achievement and successful people, and that \\"people do not steal because they are poor, they are poor because they steal.\\" Sheaffer advocates for a new system of morality based on achievement and success rather than religious morality, which he argues celebrates weakness; he \\"excoriates religion for romanticizing, and hence perpetuating, economic incompetence...[Sheaffer] urges the impoverished to break away from a slave morality that encourages passivity.\\"(http://www.debunker.com/books.html) A review praises Resentment Against Achievement by stating that \\"for all its harsh denunciation of the resentful, this book is a positive call to action not to harm people but to help them succeed\\", and that Sheaffer contends that people \\"who adopt higher-class values and ethics will gradually find themselves accumulating so much money that no one will doubt their status any longer.\\" X-Files The twentieth episode of the third season of the X-Files television series, entitled Jose Chung's From Outer Space, referenced Robert Sheaffer. The plot featured US Air Force test pilots, dressed as aliens, who flew a secret military aircraft designed to resemble a UFO. One pilot was named \\"Jacques Sheaffer\\" and the other \\"Robert Vallee\\". According to Sheaffer, Chris Carter, the creator of the X-Files series, decided to name the characters after ufologist Jacques Vallee, and debunker Sheaffer, as a joke. Sheaffer further states that \\"The M.P. [military policeman] who later arrested them (the test pilots) was Sergeant Hynek\\", a reference to prominent ufologist J. Allen Hynek. Speaking engagements Sheaffer was one of the leaders of a workshop on \\"Preserving Skeptic History\\" at The Amazing Meeting in 2013. He was on the panel of the \\"UFO Claims\\" session at CSICon, a conference put on by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, in 2011. He spoke at the \\"UFOs: The Space-Age Mythology\\" CSI workshop in 2009. He spoke at the \\"Animal Mutilations, Star Maps, UFOs and Television\\" session of the \\"Science, Skepticism and the Paranormal\\" conference put on by CSICOP in 1983. He spoke at the \\"Where Are They\\" symposium at the University of Maryland, November, 1979. Personal life Opera Sheaffer has had a passion for opera since the age of six, and has been taking lessons since 1991. He is a tenor and regularly performs in professional opera productions.

One article, cited by the Washington Post and other publications around the globe, detailed an incident where Bush and her friends escaped from the assigned Secret Service detail by stranding them at a tollbooth. (Bush was on her way to see a wrestling match at Madison Square Garden.) Barbara's driver had an E-ZPass and the Secret Service did not, which put the Secret Service agents in a position where they had to race at a high speed to catch up with the First Daughter. The Barbara article received attention at the highest levels in the Secret Service and the White House, prompting the Yale administration to request that Rumpus pull the issue from their website for security concerns.Washington Post, January 7, 2004 excerpt from \\"The Perfect Wife: The Life and Choices of Laura Bush,\\" by Post reporter Ann GerhartWired, April 21, 2001. In April 2006, Rumpus was accused of insensitivity by the Asian American Students Association (AASA) and other cultural organizations on campus when the magazine published two articles about racial stereotyping. Rumpus claimed that the articles were intended to ridicule racial stereotyping, not endorse the practice. AASA requested that both Rumpus and the Yale Herald (accused of the same insensitivity) be defunded by the Yale College administration. This request was not granted.Yale Daily News, April 21, 2006.

The story was inspired by a futile special forces operation in 1964 at Tan Hoa in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, an objective that turned out to be an abandoned settlement containing only a field, an abandoned airstrip and three or four French gravestones. The graves inspired the film's title, taken from Simonides's epitaph to the three hundred soldiers who died fighting Persian invaders at Thermopylae, Greece: \\"Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, that here, obedient to their laws, we lie.\\" The choice of film's name thus constitutes a deliberate \\"spoiler\\" by the film makers, telling anyone familiar with the source of the quote that the film's soldier characters - like the Spartans at Thermopylae - had been sent to their deaths. Plot  Major Asa Barker (Burt Lancaster) has been given command of a poorly-manned outpost overlooking three villages named Boo Jum, Mung Tau & Hat Song. Barker is ordered to re-occupy a nearby, deserted hamlet named Muc Wa in South Vietnam near the rural Da Nang to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, highway that a decade earlier had been the scene of a massacre of French soldiers during the First Indochina War. Barker is a weary infantry veteran in his third war (having served in the Pacific during World War II as well as in the Korean War), who provides veteran supervision to a cadre of advisors attached to a group of South Vietnamese ordered to garrison Muc Wa.\\"Moc Hoa\\" was a real Special Forces base in the Plain of Reeds, southern Vietnam. The name is pronounced \\"muc-hwa\\", but spelled \\"Moc Hoa\\". Major Barker and his executive officer, the career-orientated Captain Olivetti, receive four replacement troops. Second Lieutenant Hamilton has been passed over for promotion and sees volunteering for Vietnam as a way to obtain a promotion to remain in the Army. First Sergeant Oleozewski served in the Korean War under Major Barker and is burnt out from three tours in Vietnam; his last assignment saw his previous unit massacred. Cpl Abraham Lincoln is a combat medic and a drug addict. The mystery to Major Barker is the fourth man, the draftee Cpl. Courcey, a demolitions expert who extended his enlistment by six months to serve in Vietnam. Major Barker sends his four new men plus Cpl. Ackley, a communications expert to garrison Muc Wa with a half French half Vietnamese interpreter/interrogation specialist called Cowboy, a hardcore squad of Hmong mercenaries and a motley mob of about 20 South Vietnamese Popular Force civilian \\"troops\\", armed with shotguns and old rifles with a sprinkling of machine guns, to attempt to create a defensible outpost at Muc Wa. On their way to Muc Wa, along a dirt road, the column encounters a booby-trapped roadblock. They capture the lone Viet Cong soldier manning the roadblock, who is beheaded by the over-enthusiastic Cowboy. On reaching the hamlet, Hamilton follows Oleozewski's advice to set up his defenses in a triangular formation and the unit receives supplies brought in by helicopter. At the rear of the hamlet is a graveyard of 302 French soldiers, massacred in a Viet Minh attack ten years earlier immortalized with a placard above the entrance that reads, in French, \\"√âtrangers, dites aux Spartiates que nous demeurons ici par ob√©issance √† leurs lois\\". Which Corporal Courcey translates \\"roughly\\" as meaning 'Stranger, when you find us lying here, go tell the Spartans we obeyed their orders', suggesting that 'it refers to the Battle of Thermopylae where over 300 Spartans died trying to hold the pass'. While he is investigating the graveyard, Courcey spots a one-eyed VC soldier, who is presumably a scout. During a patrol, Courcey spots a group of nine Vietnamese women and children fishing along the small river that runs through the deserted village, despite intelligence that there are no civilians said to live in the area. Courcey befriends one of the teenage Vietnamese girls despite that she speaks no English and Courcey cannot speak or understand Vietnamese. That evening, the VC attack Muc Wa with a harassing attack in which the doped-up Lincoln is wounded. Courcey leads an ambush patrol that kills the Viet Cong mortar crew of four, which included one of the women found by the river. The next morning, Barker travels to Saigon to meet with Colonel Minh, the military chief of the region, and tries to persuade Minh to send reinforcements of at least 300 ARVN troops to Muc Wa. But the corrupt Minh refuses, claiming that he needs the troops in Saigon to prevent a potential coup. After some reassurance and finagling of Colonel Minh, the Vietnamese Colonel informs Baker that the requested troops will be released in exchange for 1,500 155mm howitzer shells. That evening the outpost is attacked. A patrol from the outpost led by Sgt Oleonozski returns to safety but leaves a badly wounded man behind. Ignoring Oleonozski's warnings, Lt. Hamilton tries to rescue the man but is killed. The next day, Sgt Oleonozski commits suicide rather than face the pressure of command. When Barker is informed of the deaths, he wants to pull his troops out now that they lack an experienced leader, but this request is refused by Gen. Harnitz, forcing Barker to send his own deputy to Muc Wa. That night, the outpost is attacked again by massive numbers of Viet Cong who number in the many hundreds, not the few dozen predicted by high command, and all well armed with various automatic weapons, as opposed to outdated rifles. Barker is forced to threaten Harnitz over the radio to send air support for Muc Wa in which several helicopters and flare ships arrive just in time to stop the Viet Cong attack. The following morning, Barker receives orders from Harnitz to withdraw all of the American troops from Muc Wa, which is believed to be besieged by the 1,000-strong 507th Viet Cong battalion. Barker personally flies out to Muc Wa to evacuate the surviving Americans as well as the wounded by helicopter, but leaving behind the South Vietnamese troops, and due to mechanical issues with the helicopter, the walking wounded. The idealistic Courcey refuses to leave the wounded, so Barker decides to stay behind to help evacuate the remaining South Vietnamese troops and militiamen overland to safety. This leaves Barker, Courcey, Cowboy, the Nung troops, the Old Man and his fellow South Vietnamese militiamen alone at Muc Wa. The Vietnamese civilians that Courcey found and brought into the base camp steal several weapons and try to escape, forcing Cowboy to kill all of them. But the Vietnamese teenage girl that Courcey befriended gets away and informs the Viet Cong scouts of the Americans plans to withdraw, thus revealing that she and all of the other civilians were in fact Viet Cong supporters, as Cowboy predicted. That evening, Barker and Courcey are forced to destroy all of the arms and equipment left behind and then lead the group on the road departing the village, as friendly artillery fire begins raining down on the area. But no sooner has the group filed out than they are ambushed and surrounded by the Viet Cong, led by the civilian girl. Courcey is wounded but taken to shelter and hidden under some bushes by an elderly militiaman. At the same time, Barker is wounded by enemy fire and dies after suffering an apparent heart attack as the battle continues. After the final battle, the only survivor is the willing volunteer, Courcey, whose idealism and enthusiasm for the Vietnam War has now died along with his comrades. He wakes up in the morning to find that everyone else is dead and the soldiers, including Barker, are stripped of their fatigues. The VC have withdrawn. As Courcey wanders to the French grave site, he finds an enemy survivor: the wounded, one-eyed VC scout that he saw earlier. The VC points his rifle at Courcey before dropping it out of exhaustion. Courcey says to the one-eyed VC, \\"I'm going home, Charlie, if they'll let me\\" as he wanders off the grave site and onto the dirt road leading away from the ruins of the village. The film closes with the title card which reads '1964'. Cast *Burt Lancaster as Maj. Asa Barker *Craig Wasson as Cpl. Courcey *Jonathan Goldsmith as Sgt. Oleonowski *Marc Singer as Capt.

Schlitz Production The screenplay by Wendell Mayes was shopped around for years with various older leading men such as Robert Mitchum, William Holden and Paul Newman offered the role of Major Asa Barker. The project was turned down by Paramount and 20th Century Fox. Unlike the elite US Army Special Forces of Ford's original novel, whom he called the \\"US Army Raiders\\", Mayes' screenplay of Military Assistance Advisory Group military advisors comprised a collection of misfits. A female reporter character of the novel was removed from the screenplay. In 1977 the producers sought assistance from the United States Army who responded that assistance would only be forthcoming if modifications to the script and characters were made. The Army response stated that Army advisors to Vietnam in 1964 were \\"virtually all outstanding individuals, hand picked for their jobs, and quite experienced ... in presenting an offhand collection of losers it is totally unrealistic of the Army in Vietnam in that period\\".pp.247-348 Suid, Lawrence H. Guts & Glory: The Making of the American Military Image in Film University Press of Kentucky, 2002 Director Ted Post persuaded Avco Embassy Pictures to produce the film on a limited budget with the film shot in Valencia, California. He sent the script to a friend of Burt Lancaster, then 65 years old, who was recuperating from a knee injury - his Maj. Barker limps throughout the film.This is the second film where Lancaster was bedeviled by knee troubles. In John Frankenheimer's The Train, Lancaster injured himself playing golf on a day off from filming. A scene showing Lancaster getting shot was inserted to explain his limp. Calling the script brilliant, Lancaster agreed to star in it and when the 31-day production budget ran short, he paid $150,000 to complete it. The younger actors cast were Marc Singer as infantry Captain Al Olivetti, a gung-ho career officer seeking to earn the Combat Infantryman Badge, and Craig Wasson as Corporal Courcey, the idealistic college-educated draftee who wants to see what a real war is like.Kate Buford, Burt Lancaster (Da Capo Press, 2000) Release and reception Go Tell the Spartans was released in the United States on June 14, 1978. It was re- released on September 7, 1987, and came out on video (VHS cassette) in the United States on May 13, 1992. It was released to DVD by HBO Home Video on August 30, 2005 and on Limited Edition Blu-Ray by Scorpion Releasing in June 2016. Though the film had a limited release in the United States, critics, especially those opposed to the Vietnam War, praised it: \\"In sure, swift strokes,\\" wrote Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. in the Saturday Review, \\"it shows the irrelevance of the American presence in Vietnam, the corruption wrought by that irrelevance, and the fortuity, cruelty, and waste of an irrelevant war.\\" Stanley Kauffmann in The New Republic found it \\"the best film I've seen about the Vietnam War.\\" More broadly, Roger Grooms in the Cincinnati Enquirer judged it to be \\"one of the noblest films, ever, about men in crisis.\\" Over time, the previously overlooked film became an anti-war classic. At one of its revivals, it was described as: > A cult fave ‚Äî and deservedly so ‚Äî Go Tell the Spartans was hard-headed and > brutally realistic about our dead-end presence in Vietnam; released the same > year as Coming Home and The Deer Hunter, the film won critical admiration, > but audiences preferred individualised sagas, sentiment, and romantic > melodrama. Rather than tackle the effects of the war on physically and > emotionally wounded vets, this brave film exposed the fundamental, tactical > lunacy of the war as perceived by an American officer (Burt Lancaster) who > knows better, but must follow through on stupid, self-destructive orders > from above. This is one of Lancaster's best performances: embittered, a cog > in the military juggernaut, this good man foresees the killing waste to > come.Program notes at the Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, May 2000 In 1979, Wendell Mayes' screenplay was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for \\"Best Drama Adapted from Another Medium (Screen)\\".

As of July 2008 AACo had a staff of 500 and operated 24 cattle stations and two feedlots, consisting of over 565,000 beef cattle.  Founding  The company was founded in 1824 through an Act of the British Parliament, with the right to select in New South Wales for agricultural development, it is one of Australia's oldest still-operating companies. Its headquarters are today in Brisbane and it has been listed (or relisted) on the Australian Stock Exchange since 2001. Among the principal members of this company were the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General of England, 28 Members of Parliament, including Mr. Brougham, and Joseph Hume, the Governor, Deputy Governor and eight of the directors of the Bank of England; the Chairman and Deputy-Chairman and five directors of the British East India Company, besides many other eminent bankers and merchants of England. AACo acquired its first property Tahlee in New South Wales on 24 December 1829.Heaton, J. H. 1984, The Bedside Book of Colonial Doings, previously published in 1879 as Australian Dictionary of Dates containing the History of Australasia from 1542 to May, 1879, p.18 The area selected under the founding charter extended from Port Stephens, embracing the Karuah River valley, to the Gloucester flats, and to the Manning River, including most of the northern shore of Port Stephens, extending to . The company had commenced its operations in order to improve flocks of Merino sheep in New South Wales for export to Great Britain. Merino sheep were preferred because there was an abundance of land at the time and because the mild winters meant there was no cost for housing or handfeeding stock. However, it soon found that better land was available and, in 1830, a communication from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to Governor Darling notified the latter that the company was to be permitted to select land in the interior of the colony, in lieu of an equivalent area at Port Stephens, but retaining mineral rights to the latter. After an inspection in 1833, the company decided on two new areas. These were the Warrah Estate of , west of Murrurundi, and Goonoo Goonoo estate of , along with the left bank of the Peel River to the south of present-day Tamworth, New South Wales. The township of West Tamworth adjacent to the present city was the original company-owned business centre for the area. In 1856, Arthur Hodgson was appointed general superintendent of the company. The pioneering settlers of the area were ordered to leave and paid little from the company for their properties. Convicts soon became the companies largest type of employee, although those who had served a sentence, aborigines and indentured servants on seven-year contracts were also employed with the latter making up the bulk of initial employees. The AACo attempted to exploit convict labour to generate a profit. When the supply of convicts was facing potential limits in the mid-1830s, company directors attempted to source convicts from the city- state of Hamburg.

The colonial government was not able to manage coal production efficiently. On 3 May 1833 the company received land grants at Newcastle totaling plus a 31-year monopoly on that town's coal traffic. The company became the largest exporter of coal from Newcastle for many decades. They also bought of freehold and of leasehold land on the South Maitland coalfields at Weston, near Kurri Kurri, where they built the Hebburn Colliery. Because of drought and depression during the 1840s mining created more profit than wool production did. By December 1903 the pit was sending a fully loaded train away each day. By 1912, the output exceeded per day and a large overseas trade had developed from this mine. In May 1906 the company purchased a half- share in the Aberdare Junction to Cessnock railway for ¬£40,000 which, already owning the other half, placed them in full ownership of the line. With the post-Great War slump, the company ceased its coal-mining activities in the early 1920s, sold their assets therein, and moved on into the cattle industry. The AACo's coat-of-arms are affixed to two stone columns erected in Gordon Avenue, Hamilton (originally known as Pittown, Borehole or Happy Flat)located on the corners Learmonth Park (Alexander Street and Gordon Avenue, and Jenner Parade and Gordon Avenue)in an area once known as Newcastle's garden suburb. Australia's first railway On 10 December 1831 the Australian Agricultural Company officially opened Australia's first railway, located at the intersection of Brown & Church Streets, Newcastle, New South Wales. Privately owned and operated to service the A Pit coal mine, it was a cast- iron fishbelly rail on an inclined plane as a gravitational railway, described as follows: The AACo constructed a total of three gravitational railways: the second was in 1837 to service B Pit and the third was in mid-1842 to service C Pit. The gravitational railway from B Pit connected with the 1831 railway. The gravitational railway from C Pit, which made use of the last of the Government‚Äôs offer of cheap convict labour, feed onto an extended gravitational railway to reach the port. It is presumed that when the A Pit mine was exhausted in July 1846 its railway was directly transferred to form the C Pit railway, although no hard evidence can support this thought. On 10 December 2006 a plaque was unveiled on the southern shore of Newcastle Harbour celebrating this event. Short-lived coal monopoly & providing land access: disputes with James Mitchell In 1828, 3 years after commencing their 31-year lease, the AACo was accorded a monopolistic position after the company received a grant of of coal land in the centre of Newcastle. Further, it was feared that the company may have had control of the entire coal supply in the Colony had the Crown Law Officers responsible for the substitution of a grant for the lease not objected and an alternative agreed upon. Between 1835 and 1850, the AACo was involved in significant Australian historical law events relating to monopolistic coal mining and private railway access. In 1835 James Mitchell purchased approximately of coastal land extending from the far side of Merewether ridge to Glenrock Lagoon and named the property the Burwood estate, which was later extended to 1,834 acres. Not long after Ludwig Leichhardt‚Äôs visit to the Burwood estate in 1842, Mitchell announced the planned commissioning of tramroad tunnels, Australia‚Äôs first two railway tunnels, through Burwood ridge (or bluff). While Leichhardt visited the Burwood estate he drew up the stratigraphy of the coastline. It is speculated that Leichhardt may have established the extent of the coal seams under Mitchell‚Äôs property. Mitchell claimed the construction of the tunnels was to allow access to Burwood Beach in order to build a salt works. It is further speculated that Mitchell actually sought to destroy the Australian Agricultural Company‚Äôs legal monopoly on coal mining. Prior to these events Mitchell had already approached Governor Gipps seeking: # a repeal of the Metallic Ores Act; # Newcastle be made a free port and # that he be permitted to mine and use coal from Burwood estate as fuel for a copper smelter. Mitchell was unsuccessful with only his request to use coal as fuel in a copper smelter. Although Mitchell had no legal use of coal, the commissioned tunnel project commenced in 1846 with the cutting line being directly into a coal seam. Between 2 and 3 thousand tonnes of coal were extracted but unusable owing to the AACo's monopoly. Whilst Mitchell‚Äôs operations were going on, a number of small illegal mines operated in the district in defiance of the monopoly. A mine near East Maitland operated by Mr James Brown undercut the AACo's price to supply coal to steamships at Morpeth which led to prosecution. The Government‚Äôs legal advice after this case was that they would have to individually prosecute every illegal mine, which Governor FitzRoy believed the cost of the prosecutions should be paid for by the Australian Agricultural Company. In 1847, the NSW Legislative Council created the Coal Inquiry and appointed a Select Committee to investigate the matter. Both Mitchell and Brown gave evidence; Mitchell in relation to his tunnel and Brown in relation to price cutting. Before the Committee could issue any recommendations the Australian Agricultural Company relinquished its monopoly. Mitchell proceeded to lease out the coal rights on the Burwood estate, with five mines being quickly established by J & A Brown, Donaldson, Alexander Brown, Nott and Morgan. Because the AACo owned the land between the Burwood estate and the Port of Newcastle the company refused to allow Mitchell to transport coal by rail across its land. Mitchell successfully lobbied the Government again by having New South Wales‚Äô first Private Act of Parliament titled, Burwood and Newcastle Tramroad Act 1850, passed, that specifically allowed Mitchell to carry coal through AACo lands. Also in 1850, the coal mining monopoly ended with the peal of the Metallic Ores Act as promised by Governor Gipps, allowing copper to be brought into NSW duty-free. After the monopoly ended, Mitchell established the copper smelter in 1851 until its closure in 1872. In 1913, salvaged bricks from the site were used to cap some of the old mines.  Company towns  * Stroud * Carrington * Hamilton Cattle stations Cattle grazing for the production of beef has always been a focus of the company. The managing director of AACo. from 1974 to 1988 was Trevor Schmidt, whose family also owned Alroy Downs Station in the Northern Territory. In 2012 the company entered an agreement with the Bunuba Cattle Company where AACo would manage the operations and the Bunuba would receive and annual rent and training opportunities and have complete access to their lands. The Bunuba hold the leases to Leopold Downs and Fairfield Downs stations, located north of Fitzroy Crossing. Together the properties occupy an area of and have a maximum carrying capacity of 20,000 head of cattle. AACo. acquired two properties in the Northern Territory, Welltree and La Belle Stations, in 2013 from R. M. Williams Agricultural Holdings. The properties had been bought for 27.1 million after R. M.

Life The third son of the architect and painter James Beattie Michie, and the renowned Scottish artist Anne Redpath, he was born in 1928 in Saint-Rapha√´l, in the Var d√©partement in the south of France. David was the younger brother of the painter and sculptor Alastair Michie, His father had a position there as private architect to Charles Thomson, a wealthy American, and the Michie family lived in the boathouse of his villa, the Chateau Gloria. After Charles Thomson suffered losses in the Crash of 1929, the decline in his fortunes eventually brought an end to the Michie family's life there, and in 1934 David returned with his mother and brothers to Hawick, his mother's home town in the Scottish Borders. From the age of six he attended primary school at Hawick, before going on to Hawick High School. In 1946, he went from school to Edinburgh College of Art (ECA), but his time there was interrupted when he was called up, following the introduction of National Service in 1947, to serve two years in the Signals Corps, mostly in Wales, qualifying as an instructor in the Royal Artillery Signals Training regiment. After his national service he returned to ECA from 1949 to 1953, where he was taught by William Gillies. The three talented young Scottish painters David Michie, David McClure and John Houston, although born in different years, as a result of the national service of the first and the war service of the second, all finished College in the same year and remained close friends afterwards. Awarded a travelling scholarship by the College in 1954, Michie went to Italy together with John Houston. They travelled to different parts of the country, but also stayed for a memorable period in the hill-top town of Anticoli Corrado. Michie originally lectured at Gray's School of Art in Aberdeen. In 1961 he returned to Edinburgh to teach at ECA. From 1982 to 1990 he was Head of the Drawing and Painting School. He served as Vice Principal from 1974-1977 and was made a Professor in 1988. He retired in 1990. In 1979 he was Visiting Artist at the University of the Arts in Belgrade. In 1991 he went to the University of California at Santa Barbara as Visiting Professor. In 1997 he was appointed an OBE, and in 2009 he received an Honorary Fellowship from ECA \\"in recognition of [his] outstanding contribution to the life of the College and the education of its students\\". David Michie had many gallery and museum exhibitions, including the Royal Scottish Academy, the Lemon Street Gallery, and the Mercury Gallery. Numerous works by the artist have been sold at auction, notably Aeroplanes Passing By, sold at Christie's King Street in The Scottish Sale in 2007. Several articles about him have been published, including Art review: The Michie Family, The Scottish Gallery, Edinburgh. He is represented in many private as well as in numerous public collections, including those of Aberdeen Art Gallery, Glasgow Museums, The City of Edinburgh Museums, The University of Edinburgh, Tate Gallery, Art in Healthcare and Maggie's Centre, Edinburgh. His work, often inspired by travel, was always colourful and light in touch. Even in the Fifties, when the painting of his close friends was often sombre, his own, though it could be dark in tone, was usually lightened in mood by flashes of bright colour. Later this same lightness of touch was often expressed in humorous observation of human behaviour. His interest lay, \\"not in grand historical paintings but in the beauty of the everyday observed at first hand, the view from his window, the racing pigeons shown by miners at a local Pigeon Fancying fair, a bunch of flowers in a jug\\". Some of his paintings reflect his travels in the USA and Australia. Favourite subjects include birds, Nature, and people in the street. He worked both in oils and watercolour.

The quintet was composed of five leading 'modern' players of the day: Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Charles Mingus, and Max Roach. It was the only time that the five men recorded together as a unit, and it was the last recorded meeting of Parker and Gillespie.Brian Priestley Mingus. A Critical Biography, London: Palladin, 1985, p.63. Background The first pianist considered by the organizers was Lennie Tristano, but he suggested Powell as a more appropriate match for the other musicians. Oscar Pettiford was considered as an alternative to Mingus. The concert Parker played a Grafton saxophone on this date; he could not be listed on the original album cover for contractual reasons, so was billed as \\"Charlie Chan\\", an allusion to the fictional detective and to Parker's wife Chan. The original plan was for the Toronto New Jazz Society and the musicians to share the profits from the recording. However, owing to a boxing prize fight between Rocky Marciano and Jersey Joe Walcott taking place simultaneously, the audience was so small that the Society was unable to pay the musicians' fees. The musicians were all given NSF checks, and only Parker was able to cash his; Gillespie noted that he did not receive his fee \\"for years and years\\". Album releases The record was originally issued in 1953 on Mingus's label Debut, from a recording made by the Toronto New Jazz Society (Dick Wattam, Alan Scharf, Roger Feather, Boyd Raeburn and Arthur Granatstein).

From 1923 to 1927 he studied at the Methodist seminary in Frankfurt, Germany. In 1929 he married Alice Mumenthaler. After completing his studies, he worked in the Methodist congregation of Basel and then became secretary of bishop John Louis Nuelsen. 1936 in an economical crises he became director of the Swiss Methodist publishing house in Zurich. In this position he contributed a lot after World War II to rebuild the completely destroyed German publishing house in Frankfurt. As publisher, his concerns were the role of laity in church, the role of the church in society, socialism and church, and world mission. Long before he became bishop, Sigg was engaged in ecumenic work. From 1942 he was the representative of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the Swiss Evangelical Church Federation (comprising the Reformed state churches of all cantons and the Methodist Episcopal Church). 1948 he took part as interpreter at the constituting conference of the World Council of Churches in Amsterdam, Netherlands. 1954, a few months after the death of his wife, he attended in Brussels, Belgium, the constituting conference of the newly created Central Conference of Middle and Southern Europe to which belonged the then Methodist Episcopal Church in Switzerland, France, Austria, Belgium, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the former Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and the Methodist work in Algeria. Some of these countries were traditionally Catholic, others traditionally Orthodox or dominated by Islam. The majority of them was under communist rule and in some of them there was a heavy persecution of Methodists. Before the election of the bishop, Bishop Arthur James Moore stated: \\"Geographically, we are in an immense space, but our church is in the same relation small and modest. The future bishop will measured by the smallness of the work have a huge task which will put a heavy strain on his head and his hands, if he wants to create a living organism out of this motley central conference.\\" Ferdinand Sigg was elected at the first ballot with 37 out of 38 votes. He dedicated himself to his office with sensitiveness and expert knowledge. He continued to be active in the ecumenic movement by sharing his experiences about Christian service in Islamic Countries and his experience as publishing director with the World Council of Churches. He also took part in the commissions for creed and church constituency in Lund, 1952 and Montreal 1964. On 27 October 1965, Ferdinand Sigg died unexpectedly in office.

A swordsman who was cursed by worms that give him immortality, Manji goes on a journey to get rid of his immortality and bodyguards the orphan Rin due to how similar he finds her to his late sister. In addition to appearing in the manga, Manji has appeared in the two series' animated adaptation where he is voiced by Tomokazu Seki and Kenjiro Tsuda in Japanese. Keith Silverstein has been Manji's English actor. Samura created Manji as an ideal hero who would show always his strong form rather than a weakness. Takuya Kimura and Takashi Miike expressed difficulties in portraying Manji in the live-action film. Critical reception to the character has been generally positive, aimed towards his fight scenes and relationship with Rin. He has also been compared with Marvel Comics' character Wolverine based on their similar traits like their faster regeneration. Creation The protagonist Manji, the author was drawn a totally straight, unvarnished version of his Samura's ideal hero: \\"a person who never reveals his or her own weaknesses to others, but who at the same time is not as unassailable powerful as he or she may seem\\". The character's immortality curse is meant to give a contrast to escapist heroes. This was influenced by 1960s's manga protagonists \\"possessing supernatural power as well as and \\"the loss and sorrow of having to live with that power\\" as an element of two sides of the same coin. As a result, Samura conceived the idea an immortal protagonist whom the readers would not like to become. In \\"flipping\\" the English version is Manji's clothing, which features a manji symbol, that if the pages were \\"flipped\\" would resemble specifically the Nazi swastika, instead of the ancient Eurasian swastika (that can be of any orientation), which for many cultures represents concepts such as peace and harmony. Tomokazu Seki has voiced and portayed Manji in the first anime and play based on the manga. Kenjiro Tsuda replaced him for the 2019 anime. Keith Silverstein did the English voice. For the live-action film, Takuya Kimura portrayed him. Director Takashi Miike cast Kimura for the role as he found him fitting due to Kimura's personal life and the differences he has with the other members of the music group SMAP. Additionally, since Kimura was also popular within Japanese fandom for over two decades by the time the film was made, he felt that his appeal would attract a bigger audience. When originally thinking Kimura playing the role of Manji, Miike received negative commentaries by his coworkers stating the actor would not play it. However, Miike still felt that due to Kimura's experience in films, he has suitable to play the leading role in the movie. He further claimed \\"\\"in order to get those in the movie, using the character of Manji was absolutely instrumental.\\" Kimura expressed multiple thoughts about his acting as Manji, such as how he deals with make up and action sequences. The special features featurette titled \\"Mangi and the 300\\", indicates that the hyperviolence of Blade of the Immortal was modeled in part on the film version of 300 from several years prior dealing with the Spartans. Kimura suffered a major wound while filming, resulting in him not being able to walk for various days. Appearances As the series opens Manji and Machi have somewhat settled down in Edo with Yaobikuni and O-Y≈ç. After an encounter with Shido \\"Johnny\\" Goybutsu, a bounty hunter disguised as a priest, Manji begins to question the purpose of his immortality. That same night he awakens to discover that Shido Hishiyasu, brother of \\"Johnny\\" Goybutsu, has kidnapped Machi in an attempt to force a confrontation between himself and Manji so that he can avenge his brother. Manji returns to Yaobikuni the next day with a proposal, to make amends for the 100 \\"good men\\" that he killed before, Manji will kill 1000 \\"evil men\\" and then the Kessen-Chu will leave his body. Some time later a young woman, Asano Rin, arrives at Manji's hut seeking his aid in avenging the murder of her parents at the hands of a renegade sword school, the Itto-Ryu. Eventually, due to the fact that Rin bears a resembalance to his deceased sister, Manji does agree to protect her on her quest. Soon after, the duo have their first encounter with a member of the Itto-Ryu. For the past two years love letters had been arriving at the Asano dojo addressed to Rin, using these the two track down Kuroi Sabato, a tall Itto-Ryu swordsmen covered head to toe in armor and a long cloak, and confront him one night. Initially Manji hangs back, allowing Rin a chance to confront and get a confession from Kuroi. With his identity confirmed Manji enters the scene, attempting to engage Kuroi in battle only to find that the swordsmen is utterly obsessed with Rin to such a point that he completely ignores Manji. He pushes past Manji, leaving his back wide open for an attack. Manji takes the opening and quickly finds himself cut in two at the waist as Kuroi reveals that he has the ability to rotate his body completely backwards. Manji manages to crawl up behind Kuroi and literally cut him to ribbons. Shortly after his encounter with Kuroi Sabato, Manji is dragged to the house of a painter by the name of Master Sori. Sori is a long-time friend of Rin's family, and she hopes to convince him to lend his sword to her cause. Manji's no frills blunt manners clash with Sori's more refined and cultured attitude almost instantly and the two exchange verbal jabs at each other several time. At first Sori refuses stating that a humble artist would be of no use, then Rin reveals that she knows the truth behind Sori, that he's not just a painter but a member of Shogunates secret police. This revelation leaves both Sorii and Manji stunned, but again he refuses, this time citing shame at how tainted his sword is due to the various illegal and immoral acts his used it in over the years. Manji sees right this facade and eventually gets Sori to admit that he just can't be bothered to risk his life while all he wants to do is paint. The two exchange insults again and almost come to blows at one point. The encounter ends with Manji storming off in a huff leaving Rin to spend the night in Sori's place. Together, Manji and Rin battle off the Itto Ryu horde and seem to be in control of the situation until Hage ensares Manji in an elaborate trap. He forces Manji back against a tree which is covered in a netting of rusty hooks, which sink into Manji's back and hold him there while Hage turns his attention to Rin. He uses many weapons, a good number of which came from defeated opponents. His two short, hooked swords are named Shid≈ç (four paths). His two standard swords are named Imo-no-Kami Tatsumasa (Sister Defender Tatsumasa). His two chained scythes are called Mumei (nameless). His double bladed sword- breaker is named Kotengu (Little devil). Most of his weapons are hidden under his shirt, a seemingly impossible feat given their large number, irregular shapes and lack of sheaths. One of Manji's signature tricks is to make any of his hidden weapons drop out of his sleeves into one or both of his waiting hands whenever they are needed. Reception Takuya Kimura has been praised for his role as Manji. Manji has been a popular character. CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama claims the video game character Haseo from .hack//G.U. was inspired by Manji visually. Otaku USA described Manji's immortality as \\"less a plot device than a symbol of his world weariness and connection to corrupt forces\\". The same site praised the character's fight against Shiro for the tention provided by the fact that Manji was missing an arm and thus multiple readers were waiting for the release of the manga volume after a major delay. Jarred Pine from Mania Beyond Entertainment had hixed thoughts in regards to Manji's fights, finding them \\"pointless\\" as it served to the character gain the trust from Giichi but praised the resolution due to reuniting the protagonist with Rin. Dark Horse Comic found Rin as a more suitable protagonist from the manga than Manji due to how she matures in the story and becomes stronger. As a result, the editor claimed that Manji is more appealing as a lead in the live-action film. UK Anime Network has a similar opinion due to how most of the narrative revolves around Rin rather than Manji in the first volume of the manga. Anime News Network found that while Manji's imprisonment is filled with negative scenes, his reunion with Rin helped to improve the dark narrative. The site also praised Manji's and Shira's fight but the reasonings behind Manji's immortality were seen as lucky. In regards to the first anime, Anime News Network criticized the lack of explanation behind Manji's curse. On the other hand, Mania Beyond Entertainment felt that both protagonists were properly developed in the series in the early episodes though he did not comment about the curse. Commenting on the 2018 anime, UK Anime Network said that while the themes explored by Manji and Rin are interesting, the fight scenes the former has are predictable due to the abuse of Manji's healing skills. Scribd regarded Manji's fight sin the reboot as one of the goriest in animation history, comparing the ones with the Netflix anime Devilman Crybaby due to how they might disturb the audience. For the live action film, The Guardian compared the duality of Manji and Rin with James Mangold's Logan film. Commenting on Manji's healing powers, the reviewer felt the film took advantage of this as it allowed the staff to delivery notorious gory scenes. Hollywood Reporter agreed, finding Manji's battle against another fighter with healing powers as an opportunity to make the writers execute more violence in the film. The New York Times enjoyed Manji's weaponry as he could wield multiple attacks through his clothing. Although IGN criticized Manji's and Rin's journey for being an excuse to battle a large amount of characters, the reviewer enjoyed their relationship, comparing them to Logan like The Guardian while also being selfaware of the idea of revenge. DVD Talk also compared Manji with the X-Men character Wolverine based on their supernatural powers and also praised the work Takuya Kimura provided in order for his character to be engaged in multiple fight scenes. Another comparison based on Manji's supernatural powers was made by Blu Ray but rather than Logan, the 1986 Highlander film due to the portayal of immortal fighters. Japan Times highly praised Kimura's work for his emotional and physical scenes despite not being at his prime in the film, comparing him to Tom Cruise.

While more complex to implement in a device, message signalled interrupts have some significant advantages over pin-based out-of-band interrupt signalling. Message signalled interrupts are supported in PCI bus since its version 2.2, and in later available PCI Express bus. Some non-PCI architectures also use message signalled interrupts.  Overview  Traditionally, a device has an interrupt line (pin) which it asserts when it wants to signal an interrupt to the host processing environment. This traditional form of interrupt signalling is an out-of-band form of control signalling since it uses a dedicated path to send such control information, separately from the main data path. MSI replaces those dedicated interrupt lines with in-band signalling, by exchanging special messages that indicate interrupts through the main data path. In particular, MSI allows the device to write a small amount of interrupt-describing data to a special memory-mapped I/O address, and the chipset then delivers the corresponding interrupt to a processor. A common misconception with MSI is that it allows the device to send data to a processor as part of the interrupt. The data that is sent as part of the memory write transaction is used by the chipset to determine which interrupt to trigger on which processor; that data is not available for the device to communicate additional information to the interrupt handler. As an example, PCI Express does not have separate interrupt pins at all; instead, it uses special in-band messages to allow pin assertion or deassertion to be emulated. Some non-PCI architectures also use MSI; as another example, HP GSC devices do not have interrupt pins and can generate interrupts only by writing directly to the processor's interrupt register in memory space. The HyperTransport protocol also supports MSI.  Advantages  While more complex to implement in a device, message signalled interrupts have some significant advantages over pin-based out-of- band interrupt signalling. On the mechanical side, fewer pins makes for a simpler, cheaper, and more reliable connector. While this is no advantage to the standard PCI connector, PCI Express takes advantage of these savings. MSI increases the number of interrupts that are possible. While conventional PCI was limited to four interrupts per card (and, because they were shared among all cards, most are using only one), message signalled interrupts allow dozens of interrupts per card, when that is useful. There is also a slight performance advantage. In software, a pin-based interrupt could race with a posted write to memory. That is, the PCI device would write data to memory and then send an interrupt to indicate the DMA write was complete. However, a PCI bridge or memory controller might buffer the write in order to not interfere with some other memory use. The interrupt could arrive before the DMA write was complete, and the processor could read stale data from memory. To prevent this race, interrupt handlers were required to read from the device to ensure that the DMA write had finished. This read had a moderate performance penalty. An MSI write cannot pass a DMA write, so the race is eliminated.  MSI types  PCI defines two optional extensions to support Message Signalled Interrupts, MSI and MSI-X. PCI Express defines its own message-based mechanism to emulate legacy PCI interrupts.  MSI  MSI (first defined in PCI 2.2) permits a device to allocate 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 interrupts. The device is programmed with an address to write to (generally a control register in an interrupt controller), and a 16-bit data word to identify it. The interrupt number is added to the data word to identify the interrupt. Some platforms such as Windows do not use all 32 interrupts but only use up to 16 interrupts.  MSI-X  MSI-X (first defined in PCI 3.0) permits a device to allocate up to 2048 interrupts. The single address used by original MSI was found to be restrictive for some architectures. In particular, it made it difficult to target individual interrupts to different processors, which is helpful in some high-speed networking applications. MSI-X allows a larger number of interrupts and gives each one a separate target address and data word. Devices with MSI-X do not necessarily support 2048 interrupts. Optional features in MSI (64-bit addressing and interrupt masking) are also mandatory with MSI-X.  PCI Express legacy interrupt emulation  PCI Express does not have physical interrupt lines, but emulates the 4 physical lines of PCI via dedicated PCI Express Messages such as Assert_INTA and Deassert_INTC. Being message-based (at the PCI Express layer), this mechanism provides some, but not all, of the advantages of the PCI layer MSI mechanism: the 4 virtual lines per device are no longer shared on the bus (although PCI Express controllers may still combine legacy interrupts internally), and interrupt changes no longer inherently suffer from race conditions. PCI Express permits devices to use these legacy interrupt messages, retaining software compatibility with PCI drivers, but they are required to also support MSI or MSI-X in the PCI layer.  x86 systems  On Intel systems, the LAPIC must be enabled for the PCI (and PCI Express) MSI/MSI-X to work, even on uniprocessor (single core) systems.APIC-Based Interrupt Subsystems on Uniprocessor PCs In these systems, MSIs are handled by writing the interrupt vector directly into the LAPIC of the processor/core that needs to service the interrupt. The Intel LAPICs of 2009 supported up to 224 MSI-based interrupts. According to a 2009 Intel benchmark using Linux, using MSI reduced the latency of interrupts by a factor of almost three when compared to I/O APIC delivery.  Operating system support  In the Microsoft family of operating systems, Windows Vista and later versions have support for both MSI and MSI-X. Support was added in the Longhorn development cycle around 2004.Interrupt Architecture Enhancements in Microsoft Windows Vista, Aug 11, 2004 MSI is not supported in earlier versions like Windows XP or Windows Server 2003.PCI, PCI-X, and PCI Express: Frequently Asked Questions, November 18, 2005, page 4 Solaris Express release 6/05 added support for MSI an MSI-X as part of their new device driver interface (DDI) interrupt framework.John Stearns, Govinda Tatti, Edward Gillett and Anish Gupta, (March 27, 2006) Changes made to support MSI in Solaris Express Advanced Interrupt Handlers in the Solaris Express 6/05 OS FreeBSD 6.3 and 7.0 added support for MSI and MSI-X.John H.

It was identified as a potential predatory publisher by Jeffrey Beall before the list was removed at the start of 2017.Beall's list  Controversy over peer review  The Wessex Institute of Technology previously organised a conference on design and nature, whilst WIT Press publishes the International Journal of Design & Nature and Ecodynamics, which has attracted attention for the subject matter of some of the papers presented and published. Contributions to its 2004 International conference programme included a joint paper by Scott A. Minnich and Stephen C. Meyer reiterating claims disputing evolution of the bacterial flagellum. The paper was cited in the landmark Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District legal case, being the first direct challenge brought in the United States federal courts testing a public school district policy that required the teaching of intelligent design. Doubts have been raised as to whether proper peer review has been followed for these conferences. In particular, several nonsensical abstracts were provisionally accepted for the VIDEA conference in 1995, although they were not included in the final programme.

It is the only remaining road in the state highway system which is still partially unpaved. Route description State Highway 74 serves as a north-south route in southeast Minnesota between Chatfield, St. Charles, Elba, and Weaver. It is legally defined as Legislative Route 74 in the Minnesota Statutes. Highway 74 begins at its intersection with U.S. 52 and State Highway 30 in Chatfield and continues north through the unincorporated communities of Troy and Saratoga. Highway 74 has a junction with Interstate 90 just south of St. Charles. In St. Charles, Highway 74 becomes Main Street, also known as Whitewater Avenue, until it joins U.S. Highway 14 briefly. Highway 74 runs concurrent west with Highway 14 for less than a mile. The route continues north again, passing through Whitewater State Park and the town of Elba. The highway ends at its junction with U.S. Highway 61 in Weaver, Minnesota. About of the northern end of the route through the Whitewater Wildlife Management Area from Beaver to Weaver, in what is known as the Weaver Bottoms, are unpaved gravel. History Highway 74 was authorized in 1933. The south end of Highway 74 previously extended south of Chatfield to old U.S. Highway 16 at Spring Valley until 1974. As a result of this, the present day mile markers begin at mile 20. Highway 74 follows, in part, an old route which was one of the first public roads in the Minnesota Territory. In 1953, the route was still gravel south of U.S. Highway 14. Highway 74 was paved by 1960, except for the northernmost 7 miles, which was still gravel as of 2018. Flood The 2007 Midwest flooding caused much damage to Highway 74. On August 18 and 19, 2007, the flooded Whitewater River destroyed bridges and washed out the roadway in several places. By 2008, repairs were complete.

Gin poles are also used to raise loads above structures too tall to reach with a crane, such as placing an antenna on top of a tower/steeple, and to lift segments of a tower on top of one-another during erection. When used to create a segmented tower, the gin pole can be detached, raised, and re-attached to the just-completed segment in order to lift the next. This process of jumping is repeated until the topmost portion of the tower is completed. They can also hold a person if strong enough.

A considerable body of her abstract work predates the first purely abstract compositions by Kandinsky. She belonged to a group called \\"The Five\\", a circle of women inspired by Theosophy who shared a belief in the importance of trying to the contact the so-called \\"High Masters\\"‚Äîoften by way of s√©ances.Bashkoff, T., ed., et al., Hilma Af Klint (New York: Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 2018). Her paintings, which sometimes resemble diagrams, were a visual representation of complex spiritual ideas.Bashkoff, Tracey, Hilma af Klint: Paintings for the Future, ArtBook, 2018  Early life  Eftersommar (Late Summer) an early naturalistic work, painted by af Klint in 1903, an example of the works she exhibited to the public during her lifetime She was the fourth child of Mathilda af Klint (n√©e Sonntag) and Captain Victor af Klint, a Swedish naval commander. Hilma af Klint spent summers with her family at their manor Hanmora on the island of Adels√∂ in Lake M√§laren. In these idyllic surroundings she came into contact with nature at an early stage in her life. This deep association with natural forms was to be an inspiration in her work. Later in life, Hilma af Klint lived permanently on Muns√∂, an island next to Adels√∂. From her family, Hilma af Klint inherited a great interest for mathematics and botany. She showed an early ability in visual art and, after the family moved to Stockholm, she studied at Tekniska skolan in Stockholm (Konstfack today), where she learned portraiture and landscape painting. She was admitted at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts at the age of twenty. During the years 1882‚Äì1887 she studied mainly drawing, portrait painting, and landscape painting. She graduated with honors and was allocated a scholarship in the form of a studio in the so-called \\"Atelier Building\\" (Atelj√©byggnaden), owned by The Academy of Fine Arts between Hamngatan and Kungstr√§dg√•rden in central Stockholm. This was the main cultural hub in the Swedish capital at that time. The same building also held Blanch's Caf√© and Blanchs Art Gallery, where conflict existed between the conventional art view of the Academy of Fine Arts and the opposition movement of the \\"Art Society\\" (Konstn√§rsf√∂rbundet), inspired by the French En Plein Air painters. Hilma af Klint began working in Stockholm, gaining recognition for her landscapes, botanical drawings, and portraits. Her conventional painting became the source of financial income, but her 'life's work' remained a quite separate practice.Cattelan, M., Gioni, M., & Subotnick, A., eds., Charley, Issue 5 (New York: D.A.P., 2007).  Spiritual and philosophical ideas  af Klint in her studio, c. 1895 In 1880 her younger sister Hermina died, and it was at this time that the spiritual dimension of her life began to develop. Her interest in abstraction and symbolism came from Hilma af Klint's involvement in spiritism, very much in vogue at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century. Her experiments in spiritual investigation started in 1879. She became interested in the Theosophy of Madame Blavatsky and the philosophy of Christian Rosencreutz. In 1908 she met Rudolf Steiner, the founder of the Anthroposophical Society, who was visiting Stockholm.Gaze, D., Concise Dictionary of Women Artists (Abingdon-on-Thames: Routledge, 2001), p. 413. Steiner introduced her to his own theories regarding the Arts, and would have some influence on her paintings later in life. Several years later, in 1920, she met him again at the Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland, the headquarters of the Anthroposophical Society. Between 1921 and 1930 she spent long periods at the Goetheanum. Af Klint's work can be understood in the wider context of the Modernist search for new forms in artistic, spiritual, political, and scientific systems at the beginning of the twentieth century.Liam Taft ‚Äì Invisible art: rediscovering the work of Hilma af Klint National Student, April 19, 2017 There was a similar interest in spirituality by other artists during this same period, including Wassily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, Kasimir Malevitch, and the French Nabis, in which many, like af Klint, were inspired by the Theosophical Movement.Theosophy and the Society in the Public Eye However, the artistic transition to abstract art and the nonfigurative painting of Hilma af Klint would occur without any contacts with the contemporary modern movements. The works of Hilma af Klint are mainly spiritual, and her artistic work is a consequence of this.[Hilma af Klint ‚Äì Painting the Unseen Serpentine Galleries, 2016. , p.24]  Work  Primordial Chaos, No. 16, 1906-07 At the Academy of Fine Arts she met Anna Cassel, the first of the four women with whom she later worked in \\"The Five\\" (De Fem), a group of artists who shared her ideas. The other members were Cornelia Cederberg, Sigrid Hedman, and Mathilda Nilsson. The Five began their association as members of the Edelweiss Society, which embraced a combination of the Theosophical teachings of Helena Blavatsky and spiritualism. All of The Five were interested in the paranormal and regularly organized spiritistic s√©ances. They opened each meeting with a prayer, followed by a meditation, a Christian sermon, and a review and analysis of a text from the New Testament. This would be followed by a s√©ance. They recorded in a book a completely new system of mystical thought, in the form of messages from higher spirits called The High Masters (\\"H√∂ga M√§stare\\"). One, Gregor, announced, \\"All the knowledge that is not of the senses, not of the intellect, not of the heart but is the property that exclusively belongs to the deepest aspect of your being...the knowledge of your spirit\\".Heiser, J., & Higgie, J., eds., Frieze: Contemporary Art and Culture, Vols 88-91 (London: Durian Publications, 2004). Through her work with The Five, Hilma af Klint created experimental automatic drawing as early as 1896, leading her toward an inventive geometric visual language capable of conceptualizing invisible forces both of the inner and outer worlds. She explored world religions, atoms, and the plant world and wrote extensively about her discoveries. As she became more familiar with this form of expression, Hilma af Klint was assigned by the High Masters to create the paintings for the \\"Temple\\" ‚Äì however she never understood what this \\"Temple\\" referred to. Hilma af Klint felt she was being directed by a force that would literally guide her hand. She wrote in her notebook: > The pictures were painted directly through me, without any preliminary > drawings, and with great force. I had no idea what the paintings were > supposed to depict; nevertheless I worked swiftly and surely, without > changing a single brush stroke.Iris M√ºller-Westermann ‚Äì Paintings for the > Temple ‚Äì Moderna Museet Stockholm In 1906, after 20 years of artistic works, and at the age of 44, Hilma af Klint painted her first series of abstract paintings. Svanen (The Swan), No. 17, Group 9, Series SUW, October 1914 ‚Äì March 1915, a work never exhibited during af Klint's lifetime The works for the Temple were created between 1906 and 1915, carried out in two phases with an interruption between 1908 and 1912. As Hilma af Klint discovered her new form of visual expression, she developed a new artistic language. Her painting became more autonomous and more intentional. The spiritual would continue being the main source of creativity throughout the rest of her life. The collection for the Temple are 193 paintings, grouped withinin several sub-series. The major paintings, dated 1907, are extremely large: each painting measures approximately 240 x 320 cm. This series, called The Ten Largest, describes the different phases in life, from early childhood to old age. Quite apart from their diagrammatic purpose the paintings have a freshness and a modern aesthetic of tentative line and hastily captured image: a segmented circle, a helix bisected and divided into a spectrum of lightly painted colours. The artistic world of Hilma af Klint is impregnated with symbols, letters, and words. The paintings often depict symmetrical dualities, or reciprocities: up and down, in and out, earthly and esoteric, male and female, good and evil. The colour choice throughout is metaphorical: blue stands for the female spirit, yellow for the male one, and pink / red for physical / spiritual love. The Swan and the Dove, names of two series of the Paintings for the Temple, are also symbolic, representing respectively transcendence and love. As gates to other dimensions, her paintings call for interpretation on a narrative, esoteric and artistic level while evoking primordial geometry and humanistic motifs. When Hilma af Klint had completed the works for the Temple, the spiritual guidance ended. However, she continued to pursue abstract painting, now independent from any external influence.Fiore, J., \\"How the Swedish Mystic Hilma af Klint Invented Abstract Art\\", Artsy, October 12, 2018. If the paintings for the Temple were mostly oil paintings, she now also used watercolours. Her later paintings are significantly smaller in size. She painted among others a series depicting the stand-points of different religions at various stages in history, as well as representations of the duality between the physical being and its equivalence on an esoteric level. As Hilma af Klint pursued her artistic and esoteric research, it is possible to perceive a certain inspiration from the artistic theories developed by the Anthroposophical Society from 1920 onward. Through her life, Hilma af Klint would seek to understand the mysteries that she had come in contact with through her work. She produced more than 150 notebooks with her thoughts and studies. Hilma af Klint never dared to show her abstract work to her contemporaries. Her major works, dedicated to the Temple, had been questioned and rejected by Rudolf Steiner. Hilma af Klint drew the conclusion that her time was not yet ready to understand them. More than 1200 paintings and drawings were carefully stored away in her atelier, waiting for the future. Hilma af Klint died in Djursholm, Sweden in 1944, nearly 82 years old, in the aftermath of a traffic accident, having only exhibited her works a handful of times, mainly at spiritual conferences and gatherings.Wolfe, S., \\"Lost (and Found) Artist Series: Hilma af Klint\\", Artland, October 2018.  Legacy  In her will, Hilma af Klint left all her abstract paintings to her nephew, vice-admiral Erik af Klint of the Royal Swedish Navy. She specified that her work should be kept secret for at least 20 years after her death. When the boxes were opened at the end of the 1960s, very few persons had knowledge of what would be revealed. In 1970 her paintings were offered as a gift to Moderna Museet in Stockholm, which declined the donation. Thanks to the art historian √Öke Fant, her art was introduced to an international audience in the 1980s, when he presented her at a Nordik conference in Helsinki in 1984. Erik af Klint then donated thousands of drawings and paintings to a foundation bearing the artist's name in the 1970s.Clemens Bomsdorf (April 13, 2017), Museum for pioneer of abstraction Hilma af Klint is stuck in limbo The Art Newspaper. The collection of abstract paintings of Hilma af Klint includes more than 1200 pieces. It is owned and managed by the Hilma af Klint FoundationFoundation Hilma af Klint in Stockholm, Sweden.

It was founded in March 1919 by the London District Council of the Socialist Labour Party and various anarchist groups in London and Scotland. These included Guy Aldred's Glasgow Anarchist Group. In contrast to the nascent Communist Party of Great Britain, it opposed participation in Parliamentary elections and emphasised the formation of Soviets over work in the trade unions. The group began publishing a paper, The Communist, and entered into negotiations with the aim of merging with the Workers' Socialist Federation. It also gained the support of some miners in Treherbert. Attempts to open discussions with the Independent Labour Party, the Socialist Labour Party (SLP) and the British Socialist Party did not prove fruitful. The Communist League decided to imitate Sinn F√©in's abstentionist tactic of using elections as a platform for their propaganda, while pledging not to take their seats if elected. Their proposal was not put into action, and the SLP did not accept their offer to support an SLP candidate who stood on this platform. Tensions between the anarchists and the Marxists in the group led to its dissolution in early 1920. Aldred went on to found the Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation the following year.

Imbued from his early youth with Josephinistic and Febronian principles, he advocated a German National Church, somewhat loosely connected with Rome, supported by the State and protected by it against papal interference. He encouraged the use of the vernacular in liturgical texts, the hymn book and the regular Sunday sermon. Life Born at Dresden, Ignaz Heinrich Wessenberg was the son of an aristocratic Breisgau family, and destined for a career in the church.Wassilowsky, G√ºnther, ‚ÄúWessenberg, Ignaz Heinrich von‚Äù, Religion Past and Present. Brill, 2013 His father, Johann Philipp Karl von Wessenberg, was a tutor of the princes of the electoral House of Wettin. In 1776 his family returned to Freiburg in Further Austria. His elder brother Johann von Wessenberg later entered the diplomatic service of the Habsburg Monarchy. Ignaz von Wessenberg studied theology at the Jesuit school of Augsburg and the universities of Dillingen, W√ºrzburg and Vienna. He was influenced theologically by Johann Michael Sailer. At the age of eighteen he was already canon at Constance, Augsburg and Basel. In 1798, On behalf of Prince-Bishop Dalberg sent Wessenberg on a diplomatic mission to the newly constituted Helvetic Republic. Pope Pius VII recognized Wessenberg's work at the constitutional deliberations of the Articles of Association in autumn 1801 in Bern, in successfully securing ecclesiastical rights in the Swiss part of the diocese of Constance. In 1802, when still a subdeacon, he was appointed Vicar general for the Diocese of Constance by Prince-Bishop Karl Theodor von Dalberg. It was only in 1812 that he was ordained a priest at Fulda at age 38.Ott, Michael. \\"Ignaz Heinrich von Wessenberg.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 27 December 2019] Before he became vicar-general he had shown his liberal views of religion and the Catholic Church in a work entitled Der Geist des Zeitalters (Z√ºrich, 1801). In 1802 he founded the monthly review Geistliche Monatsschrift, which he edited and used as a medium to spread his ideas of religious enlightenment. The protests against this review were such that Dalberg ordered its suspension on 25 May 1804. It was replaced by the Konstanzer Pastoralarchiv, which was less offensive and continued to be published annually in two volumes till 1827. For the realization of his pet plans of a National German Church under Primate Dalberg, Wessenberg made futile efforts at the council which Napoleon convened in Paris in 1811 and at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Vicar general Bust of Ignaz Heinrich von Wessenberg by Hans Baur A progressive churchman, he set about to abolish everything he considered superfluous or superstitious about religious customs. He did away with various holy days of obligation in the cantons of Aargau and St. Gallen in 1806, and cooperated with the Napoleonic Swiss government at Lucerne in the suppression of monasteries. He gained the support of the clergy, but in the Swiss portion of the Diocese of Constance, Wessenberg's innovations aroused great dissatisfaction. His orders in case of mixed marriages (1808) to permit the male offspring to be brought up in the religion of the father, the female in the religion of the mother; and especially his many matrimonial and other dispensations that exceeded his competence induced Fabrizio Sceberras Testaferrata, the papal nuncio at Lucerne, to call him to account, but Wessenberg insisted that nothing had been done which exceeded the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Constance, giving Testaferrata at the same time to understand that he did not recognize the Apostolic Nunciature. Wessenberg attended the Congress of Vienna Congress (1814/15) as the authorized representative of Prince Primate Dalberg, to press for a reorganization of the German church under the leadership of a primate and for the conclusion of a concordat with the Holy See covering all German states. His efforts failed due to the particular interests of both the sovereigns and the Roman Curia. The sovereigns sought state bishops, each subject to their respective rulers, while the Curia was not inclined to see a unified German church with a primitive leadership, like the previous of imperial church structure. During his administration he was especially noteworthy his deep solicitude for a better training and stricter discipline of the clergy and his insistence on regular Sunday sermons in parish churches and semi-weekly religious instructions in the state schools. He established regularly scheduled pastoral conferences for the continuing education of the clergy. He published a number of prayer books and hymn books for use in his diocese. While he did not reject the traditional forms of Baroque popular piety, as his focus was on strengthening the parishes, he did particularly encourage pilgrimages, festivals, brotherhoods, or people attending monastery churches instead people. After various requests from the Catholics of Switzerland, Pope Pius VII put an end to Wessenberg's reformist plans in that part of the diocese by severing the Swiss cantons from the Diocese of Constance, in a Brief of 21 October 1814. On 2 November of the same year the Pope ordered Bishop Dalberg to depose Wessenberg without delay from the office of vicar-general. Dalberg kept the Pope's order secret, though in the beginning of 1815 he temporarily replaced Wessenberg as Vicar general by Canon von Roll for private reasons. In the summer of 1815 he requested the government of Baden to confirm the appointment of Wessenberg as his coadjutor bishop with the right of succession. The government acceded to Dalberg's wish, but Rome refused to recognize the coadjutorship. In the same year Wessenberg published anonymously a notorious anti-papal treatise entitled Die deutsche Kirche, Ein Vorschlag zu ihrer neuen Begr√ºndung und Einrichtung. It is a plea for his scheme of a German National Church, and suggests detailed plans as to its organization. On 17 Feb., 1817, seven days after the death of Dalberg, the chapter of Constance elected Wessenberg as Vicar capitular and Diocesan administrator,\\"Ignaz Heinrich von Wessenberg\\", The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church but his election was invalidated by Pius VII in a Brief of 15 March 1817.\\"Ignaz Heinrich von Wessenberg\\", Archdiocese of Freiburg Ignaz Heinrich von Wessenberg on his deathbed, painted by Gebhard Gagg, 1860 In July Wessenberg went to Rome, hoping to gain the pope to his side and return as primate of his projected German Church or, at least, as Bishop of Constance. He was kindly received by Cardinal Ercole Consalvi, the secretary of state, but was told that, before the pope would enter into any negotiations with him, he would have to resign as administrator and, like Fran√ßois F√©nelon, make a declaration to the effect that he disapproved all that the pope disapproves. Refusing to submit to these conditions, he left Rome and with the approval of the government of Baden continued to act as administrator of Constance until 1827, in open disobedience to the pope. Pius VII suppressed the Diocese of Constance in his Bull Provida sollersque of 16 August 1821, incorporating it in the newly erected Archdiocese of Freiburg (whose first archbishop, Bernhard Boll, was appointed in 1827) and the newly erected Diocese of Rottenburg. After his retirement in 1827 he led a private life as a citizen of Konstanz, where he gave vent to his anti-papal sentiments and spread his rationalistic views on religion and the Church by various treatises and by frequent contributions to the anti-religious review, Die freim√ºthigen Bl√§tter (Constance, 1830‚Äì44). Wessenberg died in Konstanz at the age of 85, was buried in the left aisle of the Konstanz Minster.

His collection of paintings formed the basis of the Municipal Wessenberg Gallery at the Rosgarten Museum in Constance;\\"Municipal Wessenberg Gallery\\", Rosgarten Museum, Constance his comprehensive private library is today kept at the University of Konstanz.

In the show, contestants selected a mystery package (originally a treasure chest, later a gift box) in the hopes of winning cash or prizes. 1950s version (Treasure Hunt) The earliest version of the show was first broadcast in the U.S. from 1956 to 1959; initially on ABC, and then later on NBC. The original show was created, hosted, and produced by comedian and presenter Jan Murray. Two contestants played a quiz in which the challenger picked one of five categories. These were shown on a large anchor from which Murray would quiz the contestants. Each contestant was asked five questions from the chosen category for $10 apiece on the daytime edition, or $50 apiece on the prime-time editions. The player who won the most money went on the treasure hunt, with both contestants advancing if tied. In the treasure hunt, the champion picked one of 30 treasure chests. Each of these was filled with a series of prize packages or a large cash prize. The ABC prime time version offered $25,000 as its top prize. On the NBC daytime edition, the grand prize started at $1,000 and went up by $100 every time it was not won. On its prime- time counterpart, the jackpot started at $10,000 and increased by $1,000 a week until won. There were also some joke prizes, such as a head of cabbage or a pound of onions. Before Murray would open the chest, the contestant would pick an envelope from a wheel-shaped board containing sealed cash amounts from $100 up. They were then given the choice of either taking the money or the contents of the treasure chest. Regardless of the outcome, the contestant returned to play another game. At the end of the show, Murray would select someone from the audience to draw a postcard from a home viewer that had a number from 1 to 30 written on it. If the cash jackpot was in the chest marked with the same number, the home viewer won the jackpot. If not, the viewer was given a consolation prize. Also, the person who picked the postcard received a prize. Instead of looking in the treasure chest the viewer selected, Murray would open a safe, protected by a security guard, containing a folded piece of paper with the pre-selected number of the chest that actually held the cash prize. The set of the 1950s version of Treasure Hunt had a pirate-influenced motif with treasure chests. When the contestant picked a chest in the bonus round, the \\"Pirate Girl\\" (Marian Stafford), who acted as Murray's assistant, would put the box on a movable table that resembled a pirate ship. On the occasions when Murray was unavailable, other comedians would fill in as emcee, including Buddy Hackett.\\"El Paso Herald-Post\\" (El Paso, Texas): p.20 :1959-08-06 1970s version (The New Treasure Hunt) The New Treasure Hunt was a reboot of the 1950s TV series. It involved women competing to find a grand prize of $25,000, hidden in one of 30 \\"surprise packages.\\" Unlike the original version, the show did not use a question-and-answer trivia round, with contestants relying entirely on luck. The pirate theme was also abandoned, with large cardboard boxes taking the place of the treasure chests. Before each game began, the production staff distributed small gift boxes to 10 female members of the studio audience. Three of these boxes contained cards numbered 1 to 3, while the others were empty. When instructed to open the boxes, the women who found the cards would come to the stage and each choose one of three jack-in-the-boxes. The contestant whose jack-in-the-box had a pop-up surprise, such as flowers or a doll, earned the right to go on the treasure hunt. After being shown two or three of the prizes hidden among the 30 packages, the contestant was asked to select one of the boxes, which was brought down to the table by a model assistant. The host would open an envelope attached to the box and reveal a card with a dollar amount (ranging from $200 to $2,000 originally; later in the run, from $500 up to $2,500). He then handed that money to the contestant and gave her the choice of keeping it or taking the contents of the box. Possible prizes included vacations, automobiles, cash prizes between $5,000 and $14,000, and the grand prize of $25,000. Several of the boxes also contained booby prizes, referred to as \\"klunks\\" (a word coined by Geoff Edwards himself, similar in meaning to that of \\"zonks\\" on Let's Make a Deal or \\"chascos\\" on Trato Hecho), that had very little value. Upon making her decision, the contestant was not immediately shown what she had won, as the premise of this program was to display (and exploit) the female contestants' emotions. Instead, Edwards engaged the contestant in a comedic sketch, usually involving props, to intentionally mislead the contestant as to what she had finally won. Very often, a contestant would be shown a klunk only to have this lead to a different item, which could be another klunk or a more valuable prize. Two games were played during each show, each game involving a different half of the studio audience. If a contestant found the $25,000 grand prize during the first game, another was hidden for the second one. At the end of each episode, if the grand prize had not been found in the second game, Edwards ritually asked security guard Emile Autuori if he had indeed hidden the $25,000 check. Autuori would reply in the affirmative, give Edwards a card with the location of the check, and open that box so he could show it to the audience. Every episode from the second season forward began with a four-way split screen that displayed the $25,000 grand prize amount and three shots of Autouri walking down the steps on the darkened stage. The opener for the first season consisted of a single medium shot of Autouri descending the steps and walking offstage, with the grand prize and title graphics superimposed over the full-screen shot. These images were accompanied by the sound of a heartbeat and the following voice- over: \\"Ladies and gentlemen, this bonded security agent has just placed a certified check for $25,000 in one of these 30 surprise packages. Tonight, someone may win any one of our fabulous prizes, or that grand prize of $25,000, on...The New Treasure Hunt!\\" The lights then came up fully as the opening theme began. Production Producer Chuck Barris purchased the U.S. Treasure Hunt format in the 1970s and revived the game in weekly syndication in 1973. Geoff Edwards hosted The New Treasure Hunt with Johnny Jacobs as the announcer. Jan Murray received a \\"created by\\" credit during the show's closing credits. The opening theme, closing theme, and klunk music cues were composed by Chuck Barris himself. Though Barris was an accomplished songwriter, the melodic closing theme of the 1970s Treasure Hunt, also occasionally used as a winners' cue, is formally credited to Elmer Bernstein. Some of Barris's music from previous game shows, such as the unsold pilot for Cop-Out!, was also featured on the program. Producers had to devise nearly 30 sketches per episode. In order to prevent the contestant from learning about the sketch associated with her chosen box, cue cards were not used on the set. After a box was chosen, taping would be paused so that Edwards could be briefed on the premise of the prize package reveal. Edwards had experience as an actor in addition to his radio work and game show hosting, and the producers encouraged him to build the tension as he saw fit, even to unbearable levels. The only time no sketch took place was when the contestant won the grand prize. The common method of the reveal would entail Edwards suggesting to the contestant that she should have kept the money in the envelope, before revealing that she had, in fact, won the grand prize. Hysterics occurred following the revealing of the check: shrill sirens went off; confetti and balloons dropped from the ceiling; and, on a few occasions, the contestant was swarmed onstage by Barris staff members and humorously given roses. Reception This version of the show was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1974 for Outstanding Achievement in Costume Design, losing to The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman.https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1974/outstanding- costumes-for-a-series 1980s version (Treasure Hunt) Treasure Hunt returned to television in 1981 as a daily series. Geoff Edwards hosted again, with Jan Speck as the prize model and assistant. Johnny Jacobs returned to announce, but due to what would prove to be a terminal illness he left the show and Tony McClay replaced him. Emile Autuori returned in his role as the security agent responsible for placing the grand prize check in one of the boxes. Again, two games were played per show, one with each half of the audience. In this version, the female members of the studio audience were given balloons, which were popped on Edwards's cue. The woman whose balloon had a card with a star came down to the stage to challenge the previous game's champion (in the first episode, two balloons had stars). There were now only two jack-in-the-boxes, with the challenger receiving the choice between them. As in the 1970s version, the contestant who had the pop-up surprise in her jack-in-the-box advanced to the treasure hunt. The contestant selected from 66 surprise packages on stage, and again was given the opportunity to sell the box to Edwards for between $500 and $1,000. The grand prize was a progressive jackpot starting at $20,000 and increasing by $1,000 for each day it went unclaimed, to a maximum of $50,000. After being won on the fourth episode, it was held at a fixed $20,000 for a period before the progressive jackpot was reinstated. If the jackpot was won in the first game of an episode, it was reset to $20,000 for the second game. The prizes in this version were of lesser value than the 1970s series, but the champion from any treasure hunt always returned to face a new challenger in the next one and thus had a chance to increase her winnings. Automobiles were scaled back to economy models (specifically the Chevrolet Chevette); there were also no longer checks worth less than the grand prize. The show featured a new closing theme by Milton DeLugg and reused some of the music cues from the earlier version. The opening sequence from The New Treasure Hunt was retained, with alterations to reflect the number of boxes in play and the day's grand prize. Controversy An incident regarding The New Treasure Hunt concerned a contestant, Vera Augenbach, on a September 1974 episode (episode 36), who fainted on stage upon being told that she had won a 1937 Rolls-Royce Phantom convertible. This incident was replayed on 60 Minutes as part of an expos√© on the series; producer Chuck Barris expressed pride in the incident, given the show's premise.http://www.game-show- utopia.net/geoff/treasure74/newtreasurehunt.htmhttps://www.salon.com/2001/03/06/chuck_barris/ In addition to playing on the presumed emotionalism of female contestants, the decision of Barris to allow only women in the game was reportedly a safety precaution ‚Äì he was concerned that a male contestant might become angered by the show's antics (presumably including being led by a sketch, which typically ran for around five minutes or so, into a klunk) and physically attack Edwards or other staffers. However, in an interview on Blog Talk Radio, Edwards said men would most likely not show as much enthusiasm as the women, even if they won the grand prize. During the 1970s run, Barris told Edwards during the fourth season (1976‚Äì1977) that he wanted to make The New Treasure Hunt even more sadistic for the upcoming fifth season (1977‚Äì1978) ‚Äì an example being that the contestant would be shown a very expensive car (such as a Rolls- Royce, Ferrari, or Mercedes-Benz) but, after the excitement subsided, learn that the prize was only a small part of the vehicle (such as the rear-view mirror). Edwards refused and was initially fired, but Barris quickly went back on that decision and Edwards did not miss any episodes. Instead, Edwards left on his own after the season ended and Barris, unwilling to replace him, canceled the series shortly thereafter. Possible reboots The Gurin Company In October 2012, The Gurin Company bought the license of the show. The company wanted to produce an updated version in which three couples compete against each other as they select treasure chests, all of which have surprises in them. The team with the most prizes would move on to a quest for $1 million. Gurin was partnered with veteran game show host Wink Martindale, with Mark Maxwell-Smith and John Ricci Jr. as producers. It was shipped to both the U.S. and international broadcasters as he pitched the show along with a possible reboot of Truth or Consequences. Electus/Barracuda Television Productions In September 2015, Electus, along with the conjunction of Barracuda Television Productions, acquired the rights to the show where the basic premise remains the same: a single contestant selects 1 of 30 treasure chests and wins what is inside, with comedic distractions to heighten the tension at each decision point. This was to be produced by Barry Poznick, along with veteran game show host Wink Martindale and John Ricci Jr. See also *Deal or No Deal ‚Äì Game show similar in concept to Chuck Barris' Treasure Hunt. *Let's Make a Deal ‚Äì Another game show similar in concept.

Broussard organized a Mi'kmaq and Acadian militias against the British through King George's War, Father Le Loutre's War and during the French and Indian War. After the loss of Acadia to the British, he eventually led the first group of Acadians to southern Louisiana in present-day United States. His name is sometimes presented as Joseph Gaurhept Broussard; this is likely the result of a transcription error. Broussard is widely regarded as a hero and an important historical figure by both Acadians and Cajuns. Life Broussard was born in Port-Royal, Nova Scotia in 1702 to Jean-Fran√ßois Broussard and Catherine Richard. His father came from Poitiers and his mother was born in Port Royal. He lived much of his life at Le Cran (present-day Stoney Creek, Albert County, New Brunswick), along the Petitcodiac River with his wife Agnes and their eleven children. During Father Rale's War, Broussard participated in a raid on Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia (1724).James Laxer, The Acadians: In Search of a Homeland, Anchor Canada Press, p. 103 King George's War During King George's War, under the leadership of French priest Jean-Louis Le Loutre, Broussard began actively resisting the British occupation of Acadia. Broussard's forces often included Mi'kmaq allies in their resistance against the British. In 1747 he participated in and was later charged for his involvement with the Battle of Grand Pr√©. (see History of the Acadians) Father Le Loutre's War During Father Le Loutre's War, after the construction of Fort Beausejour in 1751, Broussard joined Jean-Louis Le Loutre at Beausejour. In an effort to stop the British movement into Acadia, in 1749 Broussard was involved in one of the first raids on Dartmouth, Nova Scotia which resulted in the deaths of five British settlers. The following year, Broussard was in the Battle at Chignecto and then shortly afterward he led sixty Mi'kmaq and Acadians to attack Dartmouth again, in what would be known as the \\"Dartmouth Massacre\\" (1751). Broussard and the others killed twenty British civilians and took more prisoners. Cornwallis temporarily abandoned plans to settle Dartmouth. In late April 1754, Beausoleil and a large band of Mi'kmaq and Acadians left Chignecto for Lawrencetown. They arrived in mid-May and in the night opened fired on the village. Beausoleil killed and scalped four British settlers and two soldiers. By August, as the raids continued, the residents and soldiers were withdrawn to Halifax. Capture of French ships Alcide and Lys off Newfoundland. The ships were carrying war supplies for Acadians and Mi'kmaq In the Action of 8 June 1755, a naval battle off Cape Race, Newfoundland, on board the French ships Alcide and Lys were found 10,000 scalping knives for Acadians and Indians serving under Chief Jean-Baptiste Cope and Acadian Beausoleil as they continue to fight Father Le Loutre's War. Broussard was also active in the fight against Lieutenant Colonel Robert Monckton in the Battle of Beausejour. French and Indian War With Le Loutre imprisoned after the Battle of Beausejour, Broussard became the leader of an armed resistance during the expulsion of the Acadians (1755-1764), leading assaults against the British on several occasions between 1755 and 1758 as part of the forces of Charles Deschamps de Boish√©bert et de Raffetot. After arming a ship in 1758, Broussard traveled through the upper Bay of Fundy region, where he attacked the British. His ship was seized in November 1758. He was then forced to flee, travelling first to the Miramichi and later imprisoned at Fort Edward in 1762. Finally, he was transferred and imprisoned with other Acadians in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Arrival at Louisiana Released in 1764, the year after the signing of the Treaty of Paris, Broussard left Nova Scotia, along with his family and hundreds of other Acadians, to Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti).Shane K.

The exact date of his death is unknown, but it is assumed to have been on or about October 20, 1765. Many of his descendants live in southern Louisiana and Nova Scotia. Descendancy Broussard's children and grandchildren generally remained in Louisiana, integrating into the slave-owning upper classes of the colony.

Modern cultural references The Cajun music group BeauSoleil is named after him. A New Brunswick group \\"Beausoleil Broussard\\" was very popular in the 1970s. He is a character in the novel Banished from Our Home: The Acadian Diary of Angelique Richard, Grand-Pre, Acadia, 1755 (2004) by Sharon Stewart. A dramatized, historically inaccurate version of Beausoleil is featured in the Acadian novel P√©lagie-la-Charette, by Antonine Maillet.

It was directed by Menhaj Huda and written by Noel Clarke, who also stars in the film and directed the sequel Adulthood. The majority of the characters in the film generally behave in a violent and lawless manner, engaging in crime, sex, and recreational drug taking. Plot The setting of the film takes place in an area of West London, in 2002. At a local school, student Katie is seen to suffer intense physical and emotional bullying by a group of girls, as well as by Sam Peel (Noel Clarke). When her father picks her up from school that day, Sam quietly threatens to kill her if she ever tells anyone. That evening, Katie's older brother breaks into her room to discover that she has hanged herself. The following morning, the students are informed of Katie's death and are given the day off to mourn. Anti-hero Trevor ‚ÄúTrife‚Äù Hector (Aml Ameen) and his best friends Jay (Adam Deacon) and Moony (Femi Oyeniran) decide to spend it smoking weed and drinking alcohol. Alisa (Red Madrell), Trife's ex- girlfriend and also pregnant - supposedly with Sam's baby - decides to spend the day with her best friend Becky (Jaime Winstone). Becky performs oral sex on an older man in return for drugs, and aggressively coaxes Alisa into joining in. The boys make their way to Sam's house on an estate to retrieve a Game Boy Sam had stolen from them earlier. Realising Sam is out, the boys also steal Sam's cannabis and Jay has sex with Sam's girlfriend Claire (Madeleine Fairley). Sam returns unexpectedly, but is beaten unconscious by the boys and they knock down Sam's mother as they flee. Alisa and Becky unexpectedly run into some of Katie's bullies aboard a train. Alisa, feeling bad that she was not there for Katie, berates the girls for the suffering they caused. Becky accidentally reveals that Alisa is pregnant, information that the bullies promise to spread around school in an effort to humiliate Alisa. At the next station, Alisa hurries off the train to vomit, whilst Becky scorns her for putting her life at risk. Having successfully sold the drugs they acquired earlier, they head to a shopping centre to buy dresses for a party later that evening. Becky makes demands of Alisa to buy a cheaper dress, before the pair meet up with the boys. Jay, convinced that Alisa's baby is Sam's, informs her that Trife wants nothing to do with her (although he does still care about her). Heartbroken, Alisa asks Becky if they can leave, however Becky refuses as she wants to go to the party. At the same time, Trife has gone to see his Uncle Curtis (Cornell John). Curtis presents Trifewith a revolver, the same one Trevor had drilled the barrel for in the beginning of the film at school. Trevor is shown downstairs, where Andreas (a customer seen earlier to have missed a drugs payment) is tied and beaten by Curtis and Trife. Curtis then orders Trife to carve a \\"C\\" into Andreas' face with a Stanley knife in order to test him. Though visibly terrified, Trife carries out his uncle's order, and flees the house traumatised. Trife desperately tries to call Alisa, but is unsuccessful in doing so. On her way home, Alisa runs into a classmate and persuades her to go to the party with her. At the party, Becky is stood up by Moony and fails in an attempt to convince Jay to have sex with her. Trevor interrupts Alisa and the other classmate who are kissing outside, and confesses his love for her. Alisa informs Trevor that the baby is definitely his - she had never slept with Sam. The two rekindle their love, but a vengeful Sam arrives at the party and attacks Trife. Alisa hurriedly tells Jay and Moony, who intervene to help Trife. Outside, Sam beats down both Trevor and Jay, whilst intimidating Moony into not interfering. Sam challenges all the other party goers who come out to watch, however Alisa, the only one unafraid of Sam, slaps him. When Sam grabs her by her hair, Trife gets to his feet and fights him to the ground. Alisa pleads with him to stop, and he ambles over to her. Sam takes this opportunity to grab his baseball bat, and deliver a critical blow to Trife's stomach. As this occurs, a car pulls up to the party. Brandishing a gun, the assailant demands to know who Sam is - a friend of Katie's points out Sam to him when he pretends he isn't. Removing his scarf, the assailant is shown to be Lenny, Katie's older brother. Lenny forces Sam to the ground at gunpoint, and produces the note Katie wrote before she hanged herself. Lenny prepares to kill Sam but With his dying breath, Trife saves Sam's life, telling Lenny \\"he's not worth it\\". Sam is almost killed when he insults Lenny after the latter begins to walk away, however the gun fails to fire. Sirens are heard in the distance, so Lenny, his accomplice, and Sam all flee the scene. Trife dies before the ambulance and police arrive.

Critical reception Kidulthood has received a generally positive critical response. Writing in The Guardian, Miranda Sawyer called the film \\"a rollicking UK youth ride, cinematically filmed, persuasively acted and bumped along by a fantastic all-British soundtrack ...

It was originally located in the Jefferson and Hillman Hospitals, which were acquired by the University of Alabama Board of Trustees from Jefferson County. The rapid growth of the Greater Birmingham area led the hospital to continue to expand to some 20 surrounding medical buildings. In 1992, UAB opened \\"The Kirklin Clinic\\", a 5-story outpatient facility. In November 2004, UAB Hospital opened its new 885,000-foot, 11-story building named North Pavilion. It includes 37 operating suites, two procedure rooms, three medical surgical units, four intensive care units ‚Äî trauma and burn intensive care, surgical intensive care, neuroscience intensive care, and cardiovascular intensive care, and a emergency department. Its emergency department is located on the first floor, along with the large public lobby and front door. The second floor serves as the main concourse into the UAB Hospital complex with its primary entrance on 4th Avenue South. The new hospital is equipped with state-of-the-art digital and wireless technology. Operating rooms contain voice-activated video technology allowing the surgeon to view x-rays, ECGs or pathology specimens without having to break scrub or leave the room. In February 2010, a new Women and Infant's Center was completed and opened, adjacent to the new Children's of Alabama Russell Campus hospital.

This occurs when the wind overpowers the ability of the rudder to maintain a straight course. For example, the sailboat may heel over so far that the rudder no longer engages in the water, or only to such a small extent that it can no longer steer the boat. When this happens is dependent on a number of factors such as the velocity of the wind, design of the hull and rudder and shape of the sails. This can be dangerous if it causes collisions between boats if sailing close together. Rounding up can be startling to those on board: The boat turns into the eye of the wind with all sails fluttering. However, unless the boat is in irons (stopped facing directly into the wind), control can be regained by steering the boat off the wind again to refill the sails and regain the desired course. Often the crew will need to ease out the sheets (lines that control the trim of the sail) before this can occur, in order to reduce the wind force on the sails. Rounding up is in fact a safety design of most sailboats that can help prevent a knock-down and allow the helmsman to regain control of the boat. An occasional round-up may simply be the result of a strong gust of wind. If it occurs regularly, this may be a sign that too much sail is raised and the crew may need to lower one or more sails, change to smaller sails, or reef. In smaller sailboats such as racing dinghies where the sail cannot be lessened or reefed, frequent round-ups may be a sign that the wind conditions are too strong for the boats and they should immediately proceed to shelter. Sail settings to reduce rounding up The best way to reduce rounding up in an over-canvassed boat, is to reduce sail by reefing, lowering or furling. If this is not possible due to rig design, for example, then sail adjustment may reduce or prevent rounding up when beating to windward. For a fore-and-aft rigged craft: # The vang may be loosened, the mainsheet traveller moved to windward, or both, to allow the boom rise # The mainsheet may be loosened to spill wind Allowing the boom to rise increases the twist in the mainsail, which spills wind higher in the sail while keeping power in the bottom of the mainsail to maintain the effectiveness of the rudder.

The operation encountered the first presence of Luftwaffe anti-shipping aircraft in the Mediterranean Sea. All the convoyed freighters reached their destinations. The destroyer Gallant was disabled by Italian mines and Axis bombers severely damaged the cruiser Southampton and the aircraft carrier Illustrious. Background Italy's declaration of War on 10 June 1940 brought the Second World War to the Mediterranean Sea and placed the Regia Aeronautica astride the traditional British sea route to Indian Ocean ports, while the Regia Marina roughly tripled the numbers of battleships, cruisers and submarines available to challenge British sea power. The Royal Navy had held the eastern Mediterranean and France the western Mediterranean but the Second Armistice at Compi√®gne removed the French navy from the alliance on 25 June 1940. From bases at Gibraltar and Alexandria, the Royal Navy attempted to convoy supplies to Malta to maintain it as a base in the central Mediterranean. As Italy attacked Egypt from Libya in September 1940 and Greece from Albania in October 1940, the Royal Navy maintained most of their Mediterranean Fleet at Alexandria while Force H at Gibraltar was used for raids. British successes in early November 1940 including halting the Italian offensive in Greece and disabling Italian battleships Littorio, Conte di Cavour and Caio Duilio at the Battle of Taranto provided incentive and opportunity to supply Malta and Greece.Potter & Nimitz pp. 521‚Äì527 Preparations Allied Convoy MC 4 consisted of four freighters at Gibraltar; Clan Cumming, Clan MacDonald and Empire Song carried materiel destined for Piraeus; Essex carried of seed potatoes, of ammunition and twelve crated Hawker Hurricanes for Malta.Rohwer & Hummelchen pp. 47‚Äì48 Convoy MW 5 consisted of the Freighters Breconshire and Clan Macaulay at Alexandria with cargo bound for Malta.Hague p. 192 Convoy ME 6 was made up of nine freighters waited at Malta for passage to Alexandria.

Force F was to cover Convoy MC 4 with , , , and carrying four hundred soldiers and airmen to Malta. Force H was to protect Convoy MC 4 from Gibraltar to the Skerki Banks with , , , , , , , and ferrying six Fairey Swordfish for Malta. Axis Five hundred anti-shipping aircraft of Fliegerkorps X were being transferred from Norway to Sicily to protect Axis convoys to North Africa and prevent passage of British convoys to Malta. Battle 6 January 1941 Royal Navy personnel accustomed to these Regia Aeronautica SM.79s were surprised by the intensity of X Fliegerkorps operations encountered during Operation Excess.Bartimeus pp. 56‚Äì61 Convoy MC 4 left Gibraltar, feinting toward the Atlantic, before turning toward Malta after dark, to mislead Axis agents near Gibraltar. 7 January Force H sailed from Gibraltar to cover convoy MC 4. Force A, Force D and convoy MW 5 with Force C sailed from Alexandria and Force B sailed from the Aegean toward Malta. Force A was located by Italian air reconnaissance that afternoon. 8 January Force B landed its passengers in Malta and proceeded west to meet convoy MC 4. Vickers Wellington bombers raided Naples damaging Giulio Cesare with three near misses and causing the only operational Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto to retreat from the approaching convoys. 9 January Force A was joined by Force D and south-east of Malta, Force B joined convoy MC 4; Convoy MC 4 and Force H were discovered by Italian aircraft and attacked by ten SM.79s from Sardinia. Two SM.79s were shot down by Fairey Fulmars from Ark Royal and a later attack by 15 Fiat CR.42s carrying bombs also failed. Force H left convoy MC 4 that afternoon after Ark Royal launched six Swordfish for the defence of Malta; Force A joined convoy MC 4 at dusk. 10 January Few ships survived dive bombing attacks of the intensity Illustrious endured from these Ju 87 Stukas. Italian ships from La Spezia failed to find Force H. The Italian submarine Settimo and torpedo boats Circe and Vega launched torpedoes against convoy MC 4 but missed. Bonaventure and Hereward sank Vega south of Pantellaria at 0830 and Circe escaped undamaged. Bonaventure was slightly damaged and two men killed; 75 per cent of her ammunition was expended in the engagement.Woodman p. 113 Two of Vega crew survived.Brown pp. 40‚Äì41 Right after the engagement, which pushed the British convoy too far south of their route, Gallant struck a naval mine at 0835.O'Hara 2013 p. 80 The bow was destroyed and 65 men were killed.HMS Gallant (H 59) Mohawk took Gallant in tow toward Malta while the Force B cruisers provided protection from air attacks. Convoys MC 4 and MW 5 arrived at Malta and convoy ME 6 departed for Alexandria. Fulmars from Illustrious shot down an Italian aircraft shadowing Force A at 0930. Valiant avoided torpedoes launched by two SM.79s approaching under the radar horizon at 1230. As the combat air patrol Fulmars dropped altitude to engage the SM.79s, Force A was attacked at 1235 by 18 He 111s of KG 26 and 43 Ju 87s of StG 1 and StG 2 escorted by 10 Bf 110s of ZG 26.Wood & Gunston p. 33 Illustrious completed launching Fulmar and Swordfish patrol aircraft as the attack developed. Illustrious was the main target and was enveloped in waterspouts and mist of exploding bombs. Some bombers diving from an altitude of 12,000 feet delayed bomb release until they pulled-out lower than the height of Illustrious funnel. The five air patrol Fulmars had not returned from chasing the SM.79s which attacked Valiant and the four recently launched Fulmars were unable to gain altitude rapidly enough to break up the attack. The Fulmars claimed eight enemy aircraft during the bombing of Force A as they shuttled to Malta airfields to refuel and re-arm. Warspite was lightly damaged by a bomb.HMS Warspite Illustrious was hit by five bombs, including one which failed to explode and a near miss disabled her rudder mechanism. A bomb striking a lowered elevator caused extensive hangar damage, with many casualties among aircraft maintenance personnel, nine Swordfish and five Fulmars destroyed. At 1530 Illustrious headed for Malta steering with engines. The bombing attacks continued. Seven SM.79s were discouraged by heavy anti- aircraft fire but an attack by six Italian Ju 87s at 1600 scored another bomb hit and two near misses. Fourteen German Ju 87s missed Valiant and Janus and a later attack by 14 He 111s was similarly ineffective. Illustrious reached Malta at 2130 and would suffer 126 dead and 91 wounded by the time she departed from Malta. 11 January Gallant was beached in Malta's Grand Harbor at dawn and never repaired. As Mohawk and the Force B cruisers steamed from Malta to rejoin Force A, they were surprised by 12 Ju 87R dive bombers of II/St.G.2 attacking out of the sun at 1520.Pegg, p. 12Smith, p. 101 Gloucester was hit by a bomb which failed to explode and Southampton was hit by two bombs, which killed eighty men and started fires, requiring the ship to be scuttled east of Malta. Force H returned to Gibraltar. 12 January Force A was reinforced west of Crete by Force B, the cruisers of Force D, and from Alexandria. 13 January Convoy ME 6 arrived at Alexandria. The Illustrious blitz What Maltese called the Illustrious Blitz began when bomb stocks depleted during the attacks of 10 and 11 January were replenished and the Axis made a maximum effort to destroy Illustrious before she could be repaired. Illustrious and Essex were hit during an air raid on 16 January. Ten Macchi C.202s, ten CR.42s and twenty Bf 110s escorted 44 Ju 87s. Bombs exploding in Grand Harbour killed numerous fish, that were collected after the raid and eaten. Illustrious was not seriously damaged but a bomb exploded in Essex engine room killing 15 men and wounding 23 more. There was another heavy air raid on 17 January and Illustrious was again hit in an air raid on 18 January. Illustrious was not damaged by the last big attack on 19 January. Illustrious departed Malta on 23 January but her Fulmars remained for the defence of the island. Illustrious was able to complete additional repairs after reaching Alexandria on 25 January but restoration of full combat effectiveness required a trip to United States shipyards.Pack p. 17 Losses Fairey Fulmar fighters and AA gunners of the Royal Navy shot down at least seven aircraft on 10 January 1941, in defence of Illustrious, while one Fulmar was lost.

Irish missionaries from Iona, who were proponents of Insular Christianity, were influential in the conversion of Northumbria, but after the Synod of Whitby in 664 the English church gave its allegiance to the Pope. Background Christianity was present in Roman Britain from at least the third century, introduced by tradesman, immigrants and legionaries, although most of the latter probably followed Mithraism. The Diocletian's edicts of persecution, of 303 were not rigorously enforced by Constantius Chlorus. In 313, his son, Constantine, issued the \\"Edict of Milan\\" allowing the practice of Christianity in the Empire. The following year three bishops from Britain attended the Council of Arles. They were Eborius from the city of Eboracum (York); Restitutus from the city of Londinium (London); and Adelfius, the location of whose see is uncertain. The presence of these three bishops indicates that by the early fourth century, the British Christian community was already both organised on a regional basis, and had a distinct episcopal hierarchy.Petts, David (2003). Christianity in Roman Britain. Stroud: Tempus. p. 39 Around 429, the bishops of Britain requested assistance from their colleagues in Gaul in dealing with Pelagianism. Germanus of Auxerre and Lupus, Bishop of Troyes were sent. During his sojourn in Britain, Germanus, a former government official, is reported to have led the native Britons to a victory against Pictish and Saxon raiders.Butler, Rev. Alban, \\"St. Germanus, Bishop of Auxerre, Confessor\\", The Lives of the Saints, Vol. VII, 1866 In 396, Victricius of Rouen was asked to go to Britain to resolve some doctrinal matters. In his De Laude Sanctorum (On the Praise of the Saints), he describes Britain as a wild and hostile place dealing with heresy and paganism.Villazala, David Natal. \\"Symbolic Territories: Relic Translation and Aristocratic Competition in Victricius of Rouen\\", Society for Classical Studies The Anglo-Saxons were a mix of invaders, migrants and acculturated indigenous people. Even before the withdrawal of the Romans, there were Germanic people in Britain who had been stationed there as foederati. The migration continued with the departure of the Roman army, when Anglo-Saxons were recruited to defend Britain; and also during the period of the Anglo- Saxon first rebellion of 442.Myers, J.N.L.

The English Settlements. p. 104 They settled in small groups covering a handful of widely dispersed local communities,Wickham, Chris. \\"Kings Without States: Britain and Ireland, 400‚Äì800\\", The Inheritance of Rome: Illuminating the Dark Ages, 400‚Äì1000, London: Penguin Books (2010), pp. 157, and brought from their homelands the traditions of their ancestors.Richards, Julian. \\"Stories from the Dark Earth: Meet the Ancestors Revisited\\" Episode 4 BBC 2013 There are references in Anglo-Saxon poetry, including Beowulf, that show some interaction between pagan and Christian practices and values. There is enough evidence from Gildas and elsewhere that it is safe to assume some continuing form of Christianity survived.Whinder, R., \\"Christianity in Britain before St Augustine\\", Catholic History Society 2008 The Anglo-Saxons took control of Sussex, Kent, East Anglia and part of Yorkshire; while the West Saxons founded a kingdom in Hampshire under Cerdic, around 520. Kent At the end of the 6th century the most powerful ruler in England was √Üthelberht of Kent, whose lands extended north to the River Humber. He married a Frankish princess, Bertha of Paris, daughter of Charibert I and his wife Ingoberga. There were strong trade connections between Kent and the Franks. The marriage was agreed to on the condition that she be allowed to practice her religion.Wace, Henry and Piercy, William C., \\"Bertha, wife of Ethelbert, king of Kent\\", Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the sixth Century, Hendrickson Publishers, Inc. She brought her chaplain, Liudhard, with her to England. A former Roman church was restored for Bertha just outside the City of Canterbury. Dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours, it served as her private chapel. Gregorian mission In 595, Pope Gregory I dispatched Augustine, prior of Gregory's own monastery of St Andrew in Rome, to head the mission to Kent.Stenton, F. M. (1971). Anglo-Saxon England (Third ed.). Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. , p. 104 Augustine arrived on the Isle of Thanet in 597 and established his base at the main town of Canterbury.Lyle, Marjorie (2002), Canterbury: 2000 Years of History, Tempus, p. 48 √Üthelberht converted to Christianity sometime before 601; other conversions then followed. The following year, hey established the Monastery of SS. Peter and Paul. After Augustine's death in 604, the monastery was named for him and eventually became a missionary school.Maclear, G.F., S. Augustine's, Canterbury: Its Rise, Ruin, and Restoration, London: Wells Gardner, Darton & Co., 1888 Through the influence of √Üthelberht, his nephew S√¶berht of Essex also converted, as did R√¶dwald of East Anglia, although R√¶dwald also retained an altar to the old gods.Plunkett, Steven (2005). Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times. Stroud: Tempus. p. 75 In 601 Pope Gregory sent additional missioners to assist Augustine. Among them was the monk Mellitus. Gregory wrote the Epistola ad Mellitum advising him that local temples be Christianized and asked Augustine to Christianize pagan practices, so far as possible, into dedication ceremonies or feasts of martyrs in order to ease the transition to Christianity. In 604 Augustine consecrated Mellitus as Bishop of the East Saxons. He established his see at London at a church probably founded by √Üthelberht, rather than S√¶berht.Brooks, N. P. (2004). \\"Mellitus (d. 624)\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (October 2005 revised ed.). Oxford University Press Another of Augustine's associates was Justus for whom √Üthelberht built a church near Rochester, Kent. Upon Augustine's death around 604, he was succeeded as archbishop by Laurence of Canterbury, a member of the original mission.Kirby, D.P. (1992). The Earliest English Kings. London: Routledge. p. 37 Typical Saxon altar as seen in Escomb Church. The North After the departure of the Romans, the church in Britain continued in isolation from that on the continent and developed some differences in approach. Their version of tradition is often called \\"Celtic Christianity\\". It tended to be more monastic-centered than the Roman, which favored a diocesan administration, and differed on the style of tonsure, and dating of Easter. The southern and east coasts were the areas settled first and in greatest numbers by the settlers and so were the earliest to pass from Romano-British to Anglo-Saxon control. The British clergy continued to remain active in the north and west. After meeting with Augustine, around 603, the British bishops refused to recognize him as their archbishop.Mayr-Harting, Henry (1991). The Coming of Christianity to Anglo-Saxon England. University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press. p. 71 His successor, Laurence of Canterbury, said Bishop Dag√°n had refused to either share a roof with the Roman missionaries or to eat with them. There is no indication that the British clergy made any attempts to convert the Anglo-Saxons. When √Üthelfrith of Bernicia seized the neighboring kingdom of Deira, Edwin, son of √Ülla of Deira fled into exile. Around 616, at the Battle of Chester, √Üthelfrith ordered his forces to attack a body of monks from the Abbey of Bangor-on-Dee, \\"If then they cry to their God against us, in truth, though they do not bear arms, yet they fight against us, because they oppose us by their prayers.\\"Alston, George Cyprian. \\"St. Dinooth.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 21 April 2019 Shortly after, √Üthelfrith was killed in battle against Edwin, who with the support of R√¶dwald of East Anglia claimed the throne. Edwin married the Christian √Üthelburh of Kent, daughter of √Üthelberht, and sister of King Eadbald of Kent. A condition of their marriage was that she be allowed to continue the practice of her religion. When √Üthelburh traveled north to Edwin's court, she was accompanied by the missioner Paulinus of York. Edwin eventually became a Christian, as did members of his court. When Edwin was killed in 633 at the Battle of Hatfield Chase, √Üthelburh and her children returned to her brother's court in Kent, along with Paulinus. James the Deacon remained behind to serve as a missioner in the Kingdom of Lindsey, but Bernicia and Deira reverted to heathenism. Insular missions The introduction of Christianity to Ireland dates to sometime before the 5th century, presumably in interactions with Roman Britain. In 431, Pope Celestine I consecrated Palladius a bishop and sent him to Ireland to minister to the \\"Scots believing in Christ\\".Cusack, Margaret Anne, \\"Mission of St. Palladius\\", An Illustrated History of Ireland, Chapter VIII Monks from Ireland, such as Finnian of Clonard, studied in Britain at the monastery of Cadoc the Wise, at Llancarfan and other places. Later, as monastic institutions were founded in Ireland, monks from Britain, such as Ecgberht of Ripon and Chad of Mercia, went to Ireland. In 563 Columba arrived in D√°l Riata from his homeland of Ireland and was granted land on Iona. This became the centre of his evangelising mission to the Picts. When √Üthelfrith of Northumbria was killed in battle against Edwin and R√¶dwald at the River Idle in 616, his sons fled into exile. Some of that time was spent in the kingdom of D√°l Riata, where Oswald of Northumbria became Christian. At the death of Edwin's successors at the hand of Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd, Oswald returned from exile and laid claim to the throne. He defeated the combined forces of Cadwallon and Penda of Mercia at the Battle of Heavenfield. In 634, Oswald, who had spent time in exile at Iona, asked abbot S√©g√©ne mac Fiachna√≠ to send missioners to Northumbria. At first, a bishop named Corm√°n was sent, but he alienated many people by his harshness, and returned in failure to Iona reporting that the Northumbrians were too stubborn to be converted. Aidan criticised Corm√°n's methods and was soon sent as his replacement.Kiefer, James E., \\"Aidan of Lindisfarne, Missionary\\", Biographical Sketches of memorable Christians of the past\\", Society of Archbishop Justus. 29 August 1999 Oswald gave Aidan the island of Lindisfarne, near the royal court at Bamburgh Castle. Since Oswald was fluent in both English and Irish, he often served as interpreter for Aidan. Aidan built churches, monasteries and schools throughout Northumbria. Lindisfarne became an important centre of Insular Christianity under Aidan, Cuthbert, Eadfrith and Eadberht. Cuthbert's tomb became a center for pilgrimage. Monastic foundations Around 630 Eanswith, daughter of Eadbald of Kent, founded Folkestone Priory.Alston, George Cyprian. \\"The Benedictine Order.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 25 April 2019 William of Malmesbury says R√¶dwald had a step-son, Sigeberht of East Anglia, who spent some time in exile in Gaul, where he became a Christian.William of Malmesbury. Chronicle of the Kings of England, London, George Bell and Son, 1904. p. 89 After his step-brother Eorpwald was killed, Sigeberht returned and became ruler of the East Angles. Sigeberht's conversion may have been a factor in his achieving royal power, since at that time Edwin of Northumbria and Eadbald of Kent were Christian. Around 631, Felix of Burgundy arrived in Canterbury and Archbishop Honorius sent him to Sigeberht. Alban Butler says Sigeberht met Felix during his time in Gaul and was behind Felix's coming to England.Butler, Alban. ‚ÄúSaint Felix, Bishop and Confessor‚Äù. Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Principal Saints, 1866. CatholicSaints.Info. 7 March 2013 Felix established his episcopal see at Dommoc and a monastery at Soham Abbey. Although Felix's early training may have been influenced by the Irish tradition of Luxeuil Abbey, his loyalty to Canterbury ensured that the church in East Anglia adhered to Roman norms. Around 633, Sigeberht welcomed from Ireland, Fursey and his brothers Foillan and Ultan and gave them land to establish an abbey at Cnobheresburg. Felix and Fursey effected a number of conversions and established many churches in Sigeberht's kingdom. Around the same time Sigeberht established a monastery at Beodricesworth. Whitby Abbey 1 Hilda of Whitby was the grand-niece of Edwin of Northumbria. In 627 Edwin and his household were baptized Christian. When Edwin was killed in the Battle of Hatfield Chase, the widowed Queen √Üthelburh, her children, and Hilda returned to Kent, now ruled by √Üthelburh's brother, Eadbald of Kent. √Üthelburh established Lyminge Abbey, one of the first religious houses to be founded in England. It was a double monastery, built on Roman ruins. √Üthelburh was the first abbess. It is assumed that Hilda remained with the Queen-Abbess. Nothing further is known of Hild until around 647 when having decided not to join her older sister Hereswith at Chelles Abbey in Gaul, Hild returned north. (Chelles had been founded by Bathild, the Anglo- Saxon queen consort of Clovis II.) Hild settled on a small parcel of land near the mouth of the river Ware, where under the direction of Aidan of Lindisfarne, she took up religious life. In 649, he appointed her abbess of the double monastery of Hartlepool Abbey, previously founded by the Irish recluse Hieu.\\"Hilda of Whitby\\", Society for the Study of Women Philosophers In 655, in thanksgiving for his victory over Penda of Mercia at the Battle of the Winw√¶d, King Oswiu brought his year old daughter √Ülffl√¶d to his kinswoman Hilda to be brought up at the abbey.\\"An Anglo-Saxon Monastery at Hartlepool\\", Tees Archaeology (Hild was the grand-niece of Edwin of Northumbria; Oswiu was the son of Edwin's sister Acha.) Two years later, Oswiu established a double monastery at Streoneshalh, (later known as Whitby), and appointed Hild abbess. √Ülffl√¶d then grew up there. The abbey became the leading royal nunnery of the kingdom of Deira, a centre of learning, and burial-place of the royal family. Resolving blood feuds Eormenred of Kent was the son of King Eadbald and grandson of King √Üthelberht of Kent. Upon the death of his father, his brother Eorcenberht became king. The description of Eormenred as king may indicate that he ruled jointly with his brother or, alternatively, that as sub-king in a particular area. Upon his death, his two young sons were entrusted to the care of their uncle King Eorcenberht, who was succeeded upon his death by his son Ecgberht. Through the connivance of King Ecgberht's advisor Thunor, the sons of Eormenred were murdered. The king was viewed as having either acquiesced or given the order.Wasyliw, Patricia Healy. Martyrdom, Murder, and Magic: Child Saints and Their Cults in Medieval Europe, Peter Lang, 2008, p. 74 In order to quench the family feud which this kinslaying would have provoked, Ecgberht agreed to pay a weregild for the murdered princelings to their sister. (Weregild was an important legal mechanism in early Germanic society; the other common form of legal reparation at this time was blood revenge. The payment was typically made to the family or to the clan.) The legend claims that Domne Eafe was offered (or requested) as much land as her pet hind could run around in a single lap. The result, whether miraculous or by the owner's guidance, was that she gained some eighty sulungs of land on Thanet as weregild, on which to establish the double monastery of St. Mildred's at Minster-in-Thanet. (cf. the story of St. Brigid's miraculous cloak). A similar situation arose in the North. Eanfl√¶d was the daughter of King Edwin of Northumbria. Her maternal grandfather was King √Üthelberht of Kent. She was married to Oswiu, King of Bernicia. In 651, after seven years of peaceful rule, Oswiu declared war on Oswine, King of neighboring Deira. Oswine, who belonged to the rival Deiran royal family, was Oswiu's maternal second cousin.Yorke, Barbara, Kings and Kingdoms in Early Anglo-Saxon England. London: Seaby, 1990, p. 76 Oswine refused to engage in battle, instead retreating to Gilling and the home of his friend, Earl Humwald. Humwald betrayed Oswine, delivering him to Oswiu's soldiers by whom Oswine was put to death. In Anglo-Saxon culture, it was assumed that the nearest kinsmen to a murdered person would seek to avenge the death or require some other kind of justice on account of it (such as the payment of weregild). However, Oswine's nearest kinsman was Oswiu's own wife, Eanfl√¶d, also second cousin to Oswine.Kirby, D. P. (2000). The Earliest English Kings. New York: Routledge, p. 78 In compensation for her kinsman's murder, Eanfl√¶d demanded a substantial weregild, which she then used to establish Gilling Abbey. The monastery was staffed in part by the relatives of both of their families, and given the task of offering prayers for both Oswiu's salvation and Oswine's departed soul. By founding the monastery shortly after Oswine's death,Mayr- Harting, Henry (1991). The Coming of Christianity to Anglo-Saxon England. University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, p. 106 Oswiu and Eanfl√¶d avoided the creation of a feud.Yorke, Barbara (2006). The Conversion of Britain: Religion, Politics and Society in Britain c. 600‚Äì800. London: Pearson/Longman, p. 234 Synod of Whitby (664) By the early 660s, Insular Christianity received from the monks of Iona was standard in the north and west, while the Roman tradition brought by Augustine was the practice in the south. In the Northumbrian court King Oswiu followed the tradition of the missionary monks from Iona, while Queen Eanfl√¶d, who had been brought up in Kent followed the Roman tradition. The result was that one portion of the court would be celebrating Easter, while the other was still observing the Lenten fast. At that time, Kent, Essex, and East Anglia were following Roman practice. Oswiu's eldest son, Alhfrith, son of Rhiainfellt of Rheged, seems to have supported the Roman position. Cenwalh of Wessex recommended Wilfrid, a Northumbrian churchman who had recently returned from Rome,Mayr-Harting, Henry. The Coming of Christianity to Anglo-Saxon England, 3rd edition (London: B. T. Batsford Ltd, 1991) p. 107. to Alhfrith as a cleric well-versed in Roman customs and liturgy.Kirby, D. P. (2000). The Earliest English Kings. New York: Routledge. p. 87 Alhfrith gave Wilfrid a monastery he had recently founded at Ripon, with Eata, abbot of Melrose Abbey and former student of Aidan of Lindisfarne.Higham, N. J. (1997). The Convert Kings: Power and Religious Affiliation in Early Anglo-Saxon England. Manchester, UK: Manchester University Press. p. 42. Wilfrid ejected Abbot Eata, because he would not conform to Roman customs; and Eata returned to Melrose. Cuthbert, the guest- master was also expelled.Thacker, Alan (2004). \\"Wilfrid (St Wilfrid) (c.634‚Äì709/10)\\" ((subscription required)). Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press. doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/29409 Wilfrid introduced a form of the Rule of Saint Benedict into Ripon. In 664, King Oswiu convened a meeting at Hild's monastery to discuss the matter. The Celtic party was led by Abbess Hilda, and bishops Colm√°n of Lindisfarne and Cedd of L√¶stingau. (In 653, upon the occasion of the marriage of Oswiu's daughter Alchflaed with Peada of Mercia, Oswiu had sent Cedd to evangelize the Middle Angles of Mercia.) The Roman party was led by Wilfrid and Agilbert. The meeting did not proceed entirely smoothly due to variety of languages spoken, which probably included Old Irish, Old English, Frankish and Old Welsh, as well as Latin. Bede recounted that Cedd interpreted for both sides. Cedd's facility with the languages, together with his status as a trusted royal emissary, likely made him a key figure in the negotiations. His skills were seen as an eschatological sign of the presence of the Holy Spirit, in contrast to the Biblical account of the Tower of Babel. Colman appealed to the practice of St. John; Wilfrid to St. Peter. Oswiu decided to follow Roman rather than Celtic rite, saying \\"\\"I dare not longer contradict the decrees of him who keeps the doors of the Kingdom of Heaven, lest he should refuse me admission\\".Thurston, Herbert. \\"Synod of Whitby.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 23 April 2019 Some time after the conference Colman resigned the see of Lindisfarne and returned to Ireland. Anglo-Saxon saints A number of Anglo-Saxon saints are connected to royalty.Rollason, David (1989). Saints and Relics in Anglo-Saxon England. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, p. 114 King √Üthelberht of Kent and his wife Queen Bertha were later regarded as saints for their role in establishing Christianity among the Anglo-Saxons. Their granddaughter Eanswith founded Folkestone Priory, in 630 the first monastery in England for women. Her aunt √Üthelburh founded Lyminge Abbey about four miles northwest of Folkestone on the south coast of Kent around 634. In a number of instances, the individual retired from court to take up the religious life. The sisters Mildrith, Mildburh, and Mildgyth, great granddaughters of King √Üthelberht and Queen Bertha, and all abbesses at various convents, were revered as saints. Ceolwulf of Northumbria abdicated his throne and entered the monastery at Lindisfarne.Odden, Per Einer. \\"The Holy Ceolwulf of Northumbria (~ 695-764)\\", The Roman Catholic Diocese of Oslo, May 26, 2004 In some cases, where the death of a member of royalty appears to be largely politically motivated, it was viewed as martyrdom due to the circumstances. The murdered princes √Üthelred and √Üthelberht were later commemorated as saints and martyrs. Oswine of Deira was betrayed by a trusted friend to soldiers of his enemy and kinsman Oswiu of Bernicia. Bede described Oswine as \\"most generous to all men and above all things humble; tall of stature and of graceful bearing, with pleasant manner and engaging address\\".Parker, Anselm. \\"St. Oswin.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 23 January 2020 Likewise, the sons of Arwald of the Isle of Wight were betrayed to C√¶dwalla of Wessex, but because they were converted and baptized by Abbot Cynibert of Hreutford immediately before being executed, they were considered saints. Stanton, Richard. A Menology of England and Wales, Burns & Oates, (1892) Edward the Martyr was stabbed to death on a visit to his stepmother Queen √Ülfthryth and his stepbrother, the boy √Üthelred while dismounting from his horse, although there is no indication that he was particularly noted for virtue. Royalty could use their affiliation to such cults in order to claim legitimacy against competitors to the throne. A dynasty may have had accrued prestige for having a saint in its family. Promoting a particular cult may have aided a royal family in claiming political dominance over an area, particularly if that area was recently conquered. Anglo-Saxon mission on the Continent In 644, the twenty-five year old Ecgberht of Ripon was a student at the monastery of Rath Melsigi when he and many others fell ill of the plague. He vowed that if he recovered, he would become a perpetual pilgrimage from his homeland of Britain and would lead a life of penitential prayer and fasting.Mayr-Harting, Henry. \\"Ecgberht (639‚Äì729)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 2004, accessed 24 Jan 2014 He began to organize a mission to the Frisians, but was dissuaded from going by a vision related to him by a monk who had been a disciple of Saint Boisil, prior of Melrose. Ecgberht then recruited others. Around 677, Wilfrid, bishop of York quarreled with King Ecgfrith of Northumbria and was expelled from his see. Wilfrid went to Rome to appeal Ecgfrith's decision. On the way he stopped in Utrecht at the court of Aldgisl, the rulers of the Frisians, for most of 678. Wilfrid may have been blown off course on his trip from England to the continent, and ended up in Frisia; or he may have intended to journey via Frisia to avoid Neustria, whose Mayor of the Palace, Ebroin, disliked Wilfrid. While Wilfrid was at Aldgisl's court, Ebroin offered a bushel of gold coins in return for Wilfrid, alive or dead. Aldgisl's hospitality to Wilfrid was in defiance of Frankish domination. The first missioner was Wihtberht who went to Frisia about 680 and labored for two years with the permission of Aldgisl; but being unsuccessful, Wihtberht returned to England.St. Cuthbert, His Cult and His Community to AD 1200, (Gerald Bonner et al, eds.) Boydell & Brewer, 1989, p. 194 Willibrord grew up under the influence of Wilfrid, studied under Ecgberht of Ripon, and spent twelve years at the Abbey of Rath Melsigi. Around 690, Ecgberht sent him and eleven companions to Christianise the Frisians. In 695 Willibrord was consecrated in Rome, Bishop of Utrecht. In 698 he established the Abbey of Echternach on the site of a Roman villa donated by the Austrasian noblewoman Irmina of Oeren. Aldgisl's successor Redbad was less supportive than his father, likely because the missionaries were favored by Pepin of Herstal, who sought to expand his territory into Frisia. In 716, Boniface joined Willibrord in Utrecht. Their efforts were frustrated by the war between Charles Martel and Redbad, King of the Frisians. Willibrord fled to the abbey he had founded in Echternach, while Boniface returned to the Benedictine monastery at Nhutscelle. The following year he traveled to Rome, where he was commissioned by Pope Gregory II as a traveling missionary bishop for Germania. The Benedictine Movement The Benedictine reform was led by St. Dunstan over the latter half of the 10th century. It sought to revive church piety by replacing secular canons- often under the direct influence of local landowners, and often their relatives- with celibate monks, answerable to the ecclesiastical hierarchy and ultimately to the Pope. This deeply split England, bringing it to the point of civil war, with the East Anglian nobility (such as Athelstan Half-King, Byrhtnoth) supporting Dunstan and the Wessex aristocracy (Ordgar, √Üthelm√¶r the Stout) supporting the secularists. These factions mobilised around King Eadwig (anti-Dunstan) and his brother King Edgar (pro). On the death of Edgar, his son Edward the Martyr was assassinated by the anti-Dunstan faction and their candidate, the young king √Üthelred was placed on the throne. However this \\"most terrible deed since the English came from over the sea\\" provoked such a revulsion that the secularists climbed down, although Dunstan was effectively retired. This split fatally weakened the country in the face of renewed Viking attacks. Diocesan organisation In 669 Theodore of Tarsus became Archbishop of Canterbury. In 672 he convened the Council of Hertford which was attended by a number of bishops from across Anglo-Saxon England. This Council was a milestone in the organization of the Anglo-Saxon Church, as the decrees passed by its delegates focused on issues of authority and structure within the church.Catherine Cubitt, Anglo-Saxon Church Councils, c.650-c.850 (London, 1995), p. 62. Afterwards Theodore, visiting the whole of England, consecrated new bishops and divided up the vast dioceses which in many cases were coextensive with the kingdoms of the heptarchy.

There was also an extension that was later added to the line from Ellwood City to Beaver Falls. The company had a freight station in downtown Pittsburgh on the north side of Duquesne Way just west of Barbeau Street. This connected to trackage on Duquesne Way. The railway in Ellwood City in 1908. By 1920, films were shown for the entertainment of the line's passengers. History Pittsburgh, Harmony, Butler and New Castle Railway The railway was developed by business partners Russel H. Boggs and Henry Buhl as an adjunct to their department store in Pittsburgh. Mr. Boggs already had a business relationship with many of the farms between Evans City and Pittsburgh and proposed exchanging the right of way across their land for one dollar, a guaranteed trolley stop and an electricity supply. A first step in consolidation of 11 small railways into Harmony, Butler and New Castle Railway happened when the corporation was formed in 1906. The new corporation officers were President Stanley C. Vickers; vice President Harry Ethridge; Secretary, E.M. Baisinger; Treasurer, Mark G. Hibbs, all of Pittsburgh.Railway Review, Volume 46, June 6, 1906 page 431 Railway Review, Volume 46, June 6, 1906 page 431 The first trolley ran to Ellwood City on July 2, 1908. At the southern end of the line Pittsburgh Railways took over the trolley for the run into Pittsburgh, as the final few miles was over their rails. In 1914 an extension along the Beaver Valley was opened. This left Ellwood City heading south west and crossed the Beaver River on Koppel Bridge which was built for the purpose. This bridge also carried vehicle and pedestrian traffic and was subject to a toll. Pittsburgh, Mars and Butler Railway In 1917 the railway amalgamated with the Pittsburgh and Butler Street Railway, who operated the Butler Short Line between Pittsburgh and Butler, the new company being named the Pittsburgh, Mars and Butler Railway. The new combined system had a length of . In 1922 the railway formed the Harmony Short Line Motor Transportation Company to carry freight between Bakerstown, and Butler. Bus services were introduced in 1923 alongside the Beaver Falls line, with Ellwood City and New Castle being added in 1924 and Butler to New Castle in 1925. Over the next 5 years further services were added, supplementing and paralleling trolley lines. In April 1931 the company went into receivership. The Butler Short Line was closed on April 22, 1931 as it was in poor condition, services being absorbed into the existing PA 8 bus service. Beaver Falls ‚Äì Ellwood City ‚Äì New Castle services were replaced by buses on June 15, 1931. The remaining lines were replaced by buses on the same day, with the final trolley running on August 15, 1931. The stub of the Butler Short Line continued to be used by Pittsburgh Railways as the 2 Etna service until closure in 1952.

It was traveling at near Harmony and 38 were injured in the impact. Preservation Car 115 avoided being burnt when the line closed as it had mechanical problems and had been abandoned where it failed. It became a roadside diner, The Dew Drop Inn, a role it maintained until being extracted from what was now a large restaurant and recovered to the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum where it awaits restoration. In this way it avoided being burnt twice, as the inn was destroyed by fire in 1995. In addition to this car the museum also has the original Harmony dispatch board and a shelter from both the Harmony and Butler lines. The station building in Ellwood City was retained as commercial premises. In 2007 it reopened as a donut shop and was renamed Ellwood Station as a reference to its origin.

Founded in 1919 as a produce stand, Woodman's has grown to operate seventeen stores in Wisconsin and northern Illinois. Woodman's appeared on Supermarket News Top 50 Small Chains & Independents list since 2010. All Woodman's locations are open 24 hours a day, and have a gas station and convenience store close to the store. History Woodman's Markets was started in 1919 by John Woodman as a produce stand on the corner of Milton and Sherman Avenues in Janesville. John's son, Willard, later joined his father and in 1921 they built an indoor location on the original produce stand corner. The company continued to grow throughout the middle of the 20th century and in 1956 opened a second Janesville location. The original two stores eventually closed and were replaced by one larger store in 1973. Willard's son, Phil, joined him in managing the company in the 1960s, and remains president today. In 1971 Woodman's opened its first location outside Janesville, in neighboring Beloit. In 1975 Woodman's became the first Wisconsin-based grocery store to begin using UPC scanners. Since the late 1970s, Woodman's has opened 15 stores throughout Wisconsin and Illinois. The Kenosha location, which opened in 1997, was the largest grocery store in the United States at the time. The 2001 opening of the Rockford, Illinois store marked the first Woodman's store outside Wisconsin. Woodman's was privately owned by the Woodman family until 1998, when it became a 100 percent employee owned company. In March 2008, Woodman's hit $1 billion in annual sales. The company previously owned a stake in Roundy's, now a key regional competitor. Appleton, Wisconsin location Store layout and sales model Woodman's stores are based on a modified warehouse model, with stores in the 200-250,000+ square foot range. Most new locations are built as an anchor store with several smaller outlots surrounding the store. The company prefers not to take on debt so it opens new stores only every 2‚Äì3 years, and remodels existing stores in between opening new stores. Prices at Woodman's are lower than at many large grocery store chains because of their bulk purchasing model. Most items are stocked on the shelves by employees, but special bulk purchases and other items are sometimes shelved in their shipping cases or stacked in the aisles. The store brand is Shurfine, which is one of the many brands of Elk Grove Village, Illinois-based private label co-op Topco Associates. Woodman's allows payment by cash, check, Discover card, PIN-based debit cards and EBT. Discover card is the exclusive credit of Woodman‚Äôs. All Woodman's locations are open 24 hours and have 24 hour gas stations in close proximity to the main store. Each station has a convenience store with the gas station, however the small store is only open 6am to 7pm. Fast multi-bay Oil change operations attached to that store share the same hours. The gas pumps operate unattended during off hours. Shopping carts are varied, offering electric carts, oversized carts, carts that allow children to be strapped in, and carts for adults with special needs. Woodman's partners with GrocerKey to offer online shopping with pick up or delivery.

Hvittingfoss has traditionally been associated with the manufacture of pulp, paper and paper products. History Prior to the municipal merger in 1964, Hvittingfoss was in Ytre Sandsv√¶r. Hvittingfoss borders Lardal and Hof. Hvittingfoss is located about 30 kilometers from Kongsberg. The river Numedalsl√•gen runs through the village. The village population (2005) is 1,016. Industrial development was driven by the waterfalls of Hvittingfoss as far back as the 17th century. In 1651, there were reportedly five sawmills in the northern waterfall, called Nord-fossen. The royal privileges of Vittingfossen was given to the counts in Jarlsberg and Larvik. Industrialist Christian August Anker (1840-1912) developed H√∏nefoss Tr√¶sliberi which started its production of wood pulp in 1881. The pulp and paper group Edward Lloyd Limited, owner of Lloyd's Illustrated London Newspaper and the Daily Chronicle in London, operated huge paper mills in Kemsley, England. The firm bought H√∏nefoss Tr√¶sliberi in 1902 in order to obtain a ready supply of wood pulp. In 1906, the Lloyd company built a paper mill on Hvittingfoss with a capacity of approx. 2000 ton press of thin paper for the Asian market. In 1916, the Lloyd firm sold all plants and waterfalls rights to a consortium led by a Captain Hjalmar Johansen. The Lloyd interests reserved the right to lease and operate the plants for 14 years. In 1932 the Lloyd company completed its business on Hvittingfoss after 30 years of operation.Edward Lloyd (Grace's Guide) Vittingfoss kraftverk  Vittingfoss power plant  Vittingfoss power plant (Vittingfoss kraftverk) is located on the Numedalsl√•gen just off the center of Hvittingfoss.

It was founded by the British Crown, who appointed James Douglas, then Governor of the neighbouring colony of Vancouver's Island (established in 1849) as the Colony's first Governor. Richard Clement Moody was the Colony's first Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works. At its creation, it physically constituted approximately half the present day Canadian province of British Columbia, since it did not include the Colony of Vancouver Island, the vast regions north of the Nass and Finlay Rivers, the regions east of the Rocky Mountains, or any of the coastal islands. The Colony of the Queen Charlotte Islands and the Stikine Territory were merged with it in 1863, and it was amalgamated in 1866 with the Colony of Vancouver Island to form a new Colony of British Columbia. Background The explorations of James Cook and George Vancouver, and the concessions of Spain in 1794 established British claims over the coastal area north of California. Similar claims were established inland via the explorations of such men as John Finlay, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, Simon Fraser, Samuel Black, and David Thompson, and by the subsequent establishment of fur trading posts by the North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). However, until 1858, the region which now comprises the mainland of the Province of British Columbia was an unorganised area of British North America comprising two fur trading districts: New Caledonia, north of the Thompson River drainage; and the Columbia District, located south of the Thompson and throughout the basin of the Columbia River. Sir James Douglas, first governor of the Colony of British Columbia With the signing of the Treaty of Washington in 1846, which established the US border along the 49th parallel, the HBC moved the headquarters of its western operations from Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River (present day Vancouver, Washington) to the newly established Fort Victoria, on the southern tip of Vancouver Island. Vancouver Island and the surrounding Gulf Islands in the Strait of Georgia were organised as a crown colony in 1849. Meanwhile, the mainland continued to function under the de facto administration of the HBC, whose chief executive, James Douglas, also happened to be governor of Vancouver Island. The non-aboriginal mainland population during this time never exceeded about 150 at Fort Victoria, mostly HBC employees and their families. Governorship of James Douglas By 1857, Americans and British were beginning to respond to rumors of gold in the Thompson River area. Almost overnight, some ten to twenty thousand men moved into the region around present-day Yale, British Columbia, sparking the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. Governor Douglas - who had no legal authority over New Caledonia ‚Äì stationed a gunboat at the entrance of the Fraser River to exert such authority by collecting licences from prospectors attempting to make their way upstream. To normalize its jurisdiction, and undercut any HBC claims to the resource wealth of the mainland, the district was converted to a Crown colony on 2 August 1858 by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and given the name British Columbia. Douglas was offered the governorship of the new colony by the colonial secretary, Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, on condition that he sever his relationship with the HBC. Douglas accepted these conditions, and a knighthood. The influx of people into the new colony required Douglas to act quickly in drawing up regulations and creating infrastructure. Magistrates and constables were hired, mining regulations drawn up, and town sites surveyed at Yale, Hope and Fort Langley to discourage squatting on crown land. In addition, roads were constructed into the areas of greatest mining exploration around Lillooet and Lytton. The colony, however, was not immediately granted a representative colonial assembly, because of uncertainty as to whether the gold rush would yield a stable, settled population. Douglas, who had endured unhappy conflicts with the assembly on Vancouver Island, was relieved. A portion of the Cariboo Road in the Fraser Canyon, c. 1867 The rush indeed was short lived, and the exodus of miners, speculators, and merchants was already underway by the time the Royal Engineers had laid out the colony's new capital at New Westminster. Prospecting continued, however, and additional finds farther inland in the Cariboo region in 1860 signalled an impending second gold rush. Provisioning was already proving to be an acute problem, and with more distant finds it became clear that wagon trains would have to replace pack horses, necessitating new infrastructure. Throughout his tenure, Douglas was engaged in a bitter feud with Richard Clement Moody (see below). Richard Clement Moody Selection When news of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush reached London, Moody was hand-picked by the Colonial Office, under Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, to establish British order and to transform the newly established Colony of British Columbia (1858‚Äì66) into the British Empire's \\"bulwark in the farthest west\\" and \\"found a second England on the shores of the Pacific\\". Lytton desired to send to the colony \\"representatives of the best of British culture, not just a police force\\": he sought men who possessed \\"courtesy, high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world\\" and he decided to send Moody, whom the Government considered to be the archetypal \\"English gentleman and British Officer\\" at the head of the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment, which was created by an Act of the British Parliament on 2 August 1858. The Engineers were believed to exemplify the qualities sought by the Government. Col. Richard Moody, commander of the Columbia detachment Moody and his family arrived in British Columbia in December 1858, commanding the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment. He was sworn in as the first Lieutenant- Governor of British Columbia and appointed Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for British Columbia. On the advice of Lytton, Moody hired Robert Burnaby as his personal secretary, and the two became close friends. Moody's letter to his friend Arthur Blackwood Esq. at the Colonial Office, dated 1 February 1859, contains several passages of sublime poetical description that demonstrate the qualities for which he was preferred. The Detachment under Moody consisted of 150 sappers and officers. This was later and was later increased to 172. Moody had three Captains: Robert Mann Parsons, John Marshall Grant and Henry Reynolds Luard. The contingent included two subalterns, Lieutenant Arthur Lempriere (later a Major-General) and Lieutenant Henry Palmer, a surgeon, Dr John Vernon Seddall, Captain William Driscoll Gosset, a retired Royal Engineer, who served as civilian treasurer and commissary officer, Rev. John Sheepshanks served as the detachment's chaplain, and Burnaby. Ned McGowan's War Moody had hoped to begin immediately the foundation of a capital city, but upon his arrival at Fort Langley he learned of an outbreak of violence at the settlement of Hill's Bar. This led to an incident popularly known as \\"Ned McGowan's War\\", where Moody led 22 Engineers and Judge Matthew Baillie Begbie to Yale to face down a group of rebellious American miners. Order was restored without further violence. Moody describes the incident thus: \\"The notorious Ned McGowan, of Californian celebrity at the head of a band of Yankee Rowdies defying the law! Every peaceable citizen frightened out of his wits!‚ÄîSummons & warrants laughed to scorn! A Magistrate seized while on the Bench, & brought to the Rebel's camp, tried, condemned, & heavily fined! A man shot dead shortly before! Such a tale to welcome me at the close of a day of great enjoyment.\\" He enjoyed a warm reception for his success that he describes thus: \\"They gave me a Salute, firing off their loaded Revolvers over my head‚ÄîPleasant‚ÄîBalls whistling over one's head! as a compliment! Suppose a hand had dropped by accident! I stood up, & raised my cap & thanked them in the Queen's name for their loyal reception of me\\". The foundation of New Westminster In British Columbia, Moody \\"wanted to build a city of beauty in the wilderness\\" and planned his city as an iconic visual metaphor for British dominance, \\"styled and located with the objective of reinforcing the authority of the Crown and of the robe\\". Subsequent to the enactment of the Pre-emption Act of 1860, Moody settled the Lower Mainland. He selected the site and founded the new capital, New Westminster. He selected the site due to the strategic excellence of its position and the quality of its port. He was also struck by the majestic beauty of the site, writing in his letter to Blackwood, \\"The entrance to the Frazer is very striking-- Extending miles to the right & left are low marsh lands (apparently of very rich qualities) & yet fr the Background of Superb Mountains-- Swiss in outline, dark in woods, grandly towering into the clouds there is a sublimity that deeply impresses you. Everything is large and magnificent, worthy of the entrance to the Queen of England's dominions on the Pacific mainland. [...] My imagination converted the silent marshes into Cuyp-like pictures of horses and cattle lazily fattening in rich meadows in a glowing sunset. [...] The water of the deep clear Frazer was of a glassy stillness, not a ripple before us, except when a fish rose to the surface or broods of wild ducks fluttered away\\". Moody likened his vision of the nascent Colony of British Columbia to the pastoral scenes painted by Aelbert Cuyp. Moody designed the first Coat of arms of British Columbia. However, Lord Lytton \\"forgot the practicalities of paying for clearing and developing the site and the town\\" and the efforts of Moody's Engineers were continuous hampered by insufficient funds, which, together with the continuous opposition of Douglas, \\"made it impossible for [Moody's] design to be fulfilled\\". The feud between Moody and Governor James Douglas Throughout his tenure in British Columbia, Richard Clement Moody was engaged in a bitter feud with Sir James Douglas, Governor of Vancouver Island, whose jurisdiction overlapped with his own. Moody's position as Chief Commissioner and Lieutenant-Governor was one of \\"higher prestige [and] lesser authority\\" than that of Douglas, despite Moody's vastly superior social position in the eyes of the Engineers and the British Government: Moody had been selected by Lord Lytton due to his possession of the quality of the \\"archetypal English gentleman and British Officer\\", his family was \\"eminently respectable\\": he was the son of Colonel Thomas Moody (1779-1849), one of the wealthiest mercantilists in the West Indies, who owned much of the land in the islands where Douglas's father owned a small amount of land and from which Douglas's mother, \\"a half-breed\\", originated. Governor Douglas's ethnicity made him \\"an affront to Victorian society\\". Mary Moody, the descendant of the Hawks industrial dynasty and the Boyd merchant banking family, wrote on 4 August 1859 \\"it is not pleasant to serve under a Hudson's Bay Factor\\" and that the \\"Governor and Richard can never get on\\". In letter to the Colonial Office of 27 December 1858, Richard Clement Moody boasts that he had \\"entirely disarmed [Douglas] of all jealousy\\". Douglas repeatedly insulted the Engineers by attempting to assume their command and refusing to acknowledge their value in the nascent colony. Margaret A. Ormsby, author of the Dictionary of Canadian Biography entry for Moody (2002), condemns Moody for a contribution to the abortive development of the city. However, most other historians have exonerated Moody for the abortive development of the city and consider his achievement to be impressive, especially with regard to the perpetual insufficiency of funds and the personally motivated opposition of Douglas, whose opposition to the project continually retarded its development. Robert Edgar Cail, Don W. Thomson, Ishiguro, and Scott have praised Moody for his contribution, the latter accusing Ormsby of being \\"adamant in her dislike of Colonel Moody\\" despite the evidence, and almost all biographies of Moody, including those of the Institute of Civil Engineers, the Royal Engineers, and the British Columbia Historical Association, are flattering. Other developments Moody and the Royal Engineers also built an extensive road network, including what would become Kingsway, connecting New Westminster to False Creek, the North Road between Port Moody and New Westminster, and the Cariboo Road and Stanley Park. He named Burnaby Lake after his private secretary Robert Burnaby and named Port Coquitlam's 400-foot \\"Mary Hill\\" after his wife. As part of the surveying effort, several tracts were designated \\"government reserves\\", which included Stanley Park as a military reserve (a strategic location in case of an American invasion). The Pre-emption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land, so large parcels were snapped up by speculators, including 3,750 acres (1,517 hectares) by Moody himself. For this he was criticized by local newspapermen for land grabbing. Port Moody is named after him. It was established at the end of a trail that connected New Westminster with Burrard Inlet to defend New Westminster from potential attack from the US. By 1862, the Cariboo Gold Rush, attracting an additional 5000 miners, was underway, and Douglas hastened construction of the Great North Road (commonly known now as the Cariboo Wagon Road) up the Fraser Canyon to the prospecting region around Barkerville. By the time of this gold rush, the character of the colony was changing, as a more stable population of British colonists settled in the region, establishing businesses, opening sawmills, and engaging in fishing and agriculture. With this increased stability, objections to the colony's absentee governor and the lack of responsible government began to be vocalised, led by the influential editor of the New Westminster British Columbian and future Premier, John Robson. A series of petitions requesting an assembly were ignored by Douglas and the colonial office until Douglas was eased out of office in 1864. Finally the colony would have both an assembly and a resident governor. Frederick Seymour, second governor of the Colony of British Columbia, and his cat Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment was disbanded in July, 1863. The Moody family, only 22 men and 8 wives returned to England, while the rest, 130 sappers, elected to remain in BC. Scott contends that the departure of the Engineers \\"doomed\\" the development of the settlement and the fruition of Lord Lytton's dream. Chartres Brew replaced Moody as land commissioner. Governorship of Frederick Seymour Douglas's successor was Frederick Seymour, who came to the colony with twenty years of colonial experience in Van Diemen's Land, the British West Indies, and British Honduras. The creation of an assembly and Seymour's appointment in April 1864 signalled a new era for the colony, now out of the shadow of Vancouver Island and free of a governor suspicious of sharing power with elected representatives. Douglas's wagon road project was still underway, presenting huge engineering challenges, as it made its way up the narrow Fraser Canyon. Successive loans authorised by Seymour's predecessor, largely for the purpose of completing the road, had put the colony ¬£200,000 in debt; and the Chilcotin War of 1864 cost an additional ¬£18,000 to suppress. Seymour himself made the difficult journey through the Great Canyon of the Homathko and Rainbow Range as a show of force and participation in the hunt for Klatsassin, the Tsilhqot'in war leader, but the armed expedition reached a denouement when Klatsassin surrendered on terms of amnesty in times of war, only to be tried and hanged for murder, as Seymour had not endorsed the terms. On Seymour's return overland, he made a tour of the Cariboo minefields, and along the Fraser Canyon, which made him increasingly convinced of the colony's future prosperity. On returning to the capital, however, fiscal reality set in as it became clear that British Columbia's indebtedness was getting worse. Even as the colonial administration took drastic measures to augment revenues and improve the road system to attract prospectors and settlers, the economic situation grew increasingly dire, and agitation grew for an amalgamation of the two colonies. Seymour opposed this proposal, but with pressure from various quarters of the colonial government, he eventually relented, recommending that British Columbia be the dominant partner, and (unsuccessfully) that the capital be located at New Westminster. The two colonies were united by an Act of the British Parliament, and proclaimed on 6 August 1866 (see Colony of British Columbia (1866-1871)).

Monastic history Buckland Abbey was founded as a Cistercian abbey in 1278 by Amicia, Countess of Devon and was a daughter house of Quarr Abbey, on the Isle of Wight. It was one of the last Cistercian houses founded in England and also the most westerly. The remains of the church are about long. The width across the transepts is . The nave and presbytery is wide. In the Bishop of Exeter episcopal registers show the abbey managed five granges at Buckland plus the home farm at the abbey. A market and fair at Buckland and Cullompton were granted in 1318. In 1337 King Edward III granted the monks a licence to crenellate. The Grade I listed Tithe Barn In the 15th century the monks built a Tithe Barn which is long and survives to this day. It is Grade I listed It remained an abbey until the Dissolution of the Monasteries by King Henry VIII. At this time the revenues were placed at ¬£241 17s. 9d. per annum ().

Abbots Post monastic history In 1541 Henry sold Buckland to Sir Richard Grenville the Elder (Sewer of the Chamber to Henry VIII, poet, soldier, last Earl Marshall of Calais) who, working with his son Sir Roger Greynvile (Gentleman of the Privy Chamber of Henry VIII, Captain of the ill- fated Mary Rose), began to convert the abbey into a residence, renaming it Buckland Greynvile. Sir Roger died in 1545 when the Mary Rose heeled over in a sudden squall while the English Fleet was engaged with the French Fleet in the Narrow Sea off Portsmouth. He left a son aged 3, also named Richard Grenville, who completed the conversion in 1575‚Äì76. After being owned by the family for 40 years, Buckland Greynvile was sold by Sir Richard the Younger to two intermediaries in 1581, who unknown to Grenyvile, were working for Drake, whom he despised. The abbey is unusual in that the church was retained as the principal component of the new house whilst most of the remainder was demolished, which was a reversal of the normal outcome with this type of redevelopment. Drake lived in the house for 15 years, as did many of his collateral descendants including the Dowager Lady Seaton, Born Elisabeth Fuller-Elliot-Drake, who died on 9 May 1937. She left a life interest to Captain Richard Owen Tapps Gervis Meyrick. In 1946 he sold it to Captain Arthur Rodd, who presented the property to the National Trust in 1947.

Shami kebab is eaten as a snack or an appetizer, and is served to guests especially in the regions of Dhaka, Deccan, Punjab, Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Sindh. Shami kebabs are a popular snack throughout Indian subcontinent. They are often garnished with lemon juice and served with sliced raw onions as a side salad, and may be eaten with chutney made from mint or coriander. They are also served along with sheer khurma during Eid celebrations. Preparation Shami kababs are boiled or sauteed meat (beef or lamb) and chickpeas (chana daal) with whole hot spices (garam masala, black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves), whole ginger, whole garlic and some salt to taste until completely tender. Onions, turmeric, chili powder, egg, chopped green coriander, chopped green chillies and chopped mint leaves may be added in preparing kebab. Garam masala powder (ground spices) may be used in place of whole hot spices. The cooked meat is then ground in such a way that it is fibrous and does not become a paste. It is then shaped into diamond or round patties and is shallow fried. With a rise in vegetarianism and veganism, various new methods and recipes of making shami kabab have emerged in the subcontinent.{{citation neededdate=February 2018 gallery caption widths=\\"150px\\" heights=\\"210px\\"> File:Shami Kebab.jpgShami kebab ready for frying Serving Shami kebabs may be served with roti along with ketchup, hot sauce, Schezwan sauce,chilli garlic sauce, raita or chutney. Before serving the kebabs, it is also common to dip them in a beaten egg mixture and double fry them. They are also commonly eaten in Hyderabad with cooked rice or chapati. Etymology There are several etymological explanations behind the shami kebab. One explanation is that the name of the dish derives from the word shaam, which means \\"dinner\\" and \\"night\\" in Persian. It also means evening Urdu and Hindi. The name may also derive from the scent of an itr called shamama. The name shami kebab may also refer to Bilad al- Sham, the modern Syria, as many cooks from that region migrated to the wealthy Mughal Empire of South Asia during the Middle Ages.  In popular culture  In the British science fiction programme Red Dwarf, shami kebab is a favourite food of the main character Dave Lister. The episode \\"Polymorph\\" includes a scene in which Lister is attacked by a shape-shifting alien that has taken the form of a shami kebab. During this episode, Dave Lister is seen making what he calls \\"Shami Kebab Diablo\\". Although the popular form of the Shami Kebab is a round patty, Dave makes his more like the sausage shape of the Seekh Kebab.

Most of the land is in Middlesex County though some parcels lie in New Haven County. The forest is disjointed, and comprises land in the towns of Haddam, Chester, Deep River, Killingworth, Durham, Guilford, Madison, Clinton, Westbrook, Middletown and Middlefield. History Acquisition of forest parcels began in 1926. Two Civilian Conservation Corps camps were active in the forest in the 1930s constructing roads and planting conifers. The forest was named after a Native American chief buried in Haddam. Features ;National natural landmark A portion of the forest is known as the Chester Cedar Swamp was declared a National Natural Landmark in May 1973. Along with Pachaug-Great Meadow Swamp, it is one of the finest remaining examples of an Atlantic white cedar forest. This type of forest is at risk and being succeeded by hemlock. ;Hiking trails The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP) manages a trail system based around Pattaconk Reservoir Recreation Area near Chester. Some trails have been designated for footpath only, while others are open to horses and mountain bikes. The centerpiece for this area is the scenic Pattaconk Lake which is used for swimming, fishing, and paddling. Even though the CT DEEP has maps detailing only of trails, there are over of trails within the greater Cockaponset State Forest. According to the headquarters at Chatfield Hollow State Park, many of these unmarked trails have an undesignated status, which means that the CT DEEP has either not yet decided their use or are within an area earmarked for logging in the future. These undesignated trails are currently open to most users willing to respect low- impact travel. ;Rock climbing Pine Ledge is a popular rock climbing destination within Cockaponset State Forest located about a half mile west of Deep River, Connecticut. The rocky cliff is as high as at its southern end and extends for about a half mile north. The larger cliff faces are primarily used with top-roping techniques and there are several large bouldering rocks. The locals have also adopted the name, \\"Pine Ledge,\\" to describe the surrounding section of Cockaponset State Forest where the Pine Ledge cliff resides. At this time, the access roads are somewhat rugged and may become thick with mud after a heavy rain or during the spring melt. However, there are hardly any large rocks and few bumps, and the road is usually pretty wide. Even though the use of all-terrain-vehicles has not been officially designated, the greater Pine Ledge area has become very popular among local riders. Jeeps and 4X4 off-road vehicles have also utilized some of the old abandoned access roads as trails. There are foot paths through dense mountain laurel throughout the Pine Ledge rock climbing area as access to the more remote cliff edges.

Traveling east-west between the Charlotte metropolitan area and the Crystal Coast, connecting the cities of Charlotte, Fayetteville, Jacksonville and Morehead City. Route description Prior to the western terminus of NC 24 at Interstate 485 (I-485), the road begins as an unmarked street named W.T. Harris Boulevard at Mount Holly-Huntersville Road. The road was named for W.T. Harris, better known as one of the founders of Harris Teeter. Along the way NC 24 provides access to I-77, U.S. Route 21 (US 21), NC 115, I-85, US 29, and NC 49\\\\. At NC 27 (Albemarle Road) NC 24 makes a sharp left turn and joins that route in a concurrency, while W.T. Harris Boulevard continues further south unmarked towards US 74. NC 24 is both one of the longest and most concurrent routes in the state. Besides the approximately concurrency with NC 27 between Johnsonville and Charlotte, this route also shares long stretches of pavement with: *US 258 between Richlands and Jacksonville (16.5 miles) *NC 50 between Kenansville and Warsaw (7.5 miles) *NC 87 between Fayetteville and Spout Springs (18 miles) *Shorter concurrencies with I-40, NC 903, US 421, US 701, US 17, NC 210 (twice), NC 22, NC 109, and NC 73\\\\. It also runs briefly concurrent with US 15/US 501 in Carthage. All told, about half of the total length of NC 24 runs concurrent with other routes. As a route, it is designated as a \\"High Priority Corridor\\" for North Carolina, and much of it is highly traveled, providing the most direct access between Charlotte, Fayetteville and Jacksonville. It passes near or through three major Military installations (Fort Bragg, Pope Army Airfield, and Camp Lejeune), as well as Morrow Mountain State Park, Lake Tillery and the Uwharrie National Forest. Most of the route east of I-40 is at least four lanes, with sections at or near freeway grade. Along its eastern portions, NC 24 is known as Lejeune Boulevard thru Jacksonville, Freedom Way from the Camp Lejeune Main Gate to Swansboro, Corbett Avenue through Swansboro, Cedar Point Boulevard through Cedar Point, the W. B. McLean Highway through much of central Carteret County from JCT NC 58 to its terminus in Mansfield at US 70\\\\. History I-485 *1922: NC 24 runs from Warsaw to Laurinburg, through Fayetteville. Most of this routing west of Fayetteville is now US 401\\\\. *1925: NC 24's western terminus is extended to the South Carolina line and its eastern terminus is extended to Kenansville. *1930: The route is extended east to Swansboro, using part of US 17\\\\. Also, NC 24 is rerouted through Kenansville, Beaulaville, Richlands, and Jacksonville; NC 24 still uses most of this route today. Furthermore, NC 24 is given a more direct route from Laurinburg to Wagram. *1930s: NC 24 is rerouted numerous times after the introduction of new U.S. Highways to North Carolina. *1941: NC 24 west of Fayetteville is truncated; NC 87 and NC 78 take control of the truncated route. *1963: The western terminus of NC 24 is moved and extended to Charlotte; this produced the concurrency with NC 27\\\\. *Mid 1960s: NC 24 is routed around Clinton and its routing through Fayetteville changed. *Early 1970s: The construction of the Cape Fear River bridge at Fayetteville removed many zigzags of NC 24 in Fayetteville. *1982: NC 24 is routed along a four- lane bypass around Vander to access the newly built I-95. *2000: NC 24 is routed onto I-40 for a segment between exits 364 and 373 and onto NC 11 around Kenansville and Warsaw. The old route was signed as Business NC 24\\\\. *2003: NC 24 splits from NC 27 in eastern Charlotte to follow Harris Boulevard to a new western terminus at I-77. *2006: NC 24 is rerouted onto the Jacksonville Bypass US 17 for . The old route is signed as Business Route 24. *2008: NC 24 western terminus is extended from I-77 to I-485 on December 8, 2008. The extension added to the route. Termini In March 2003, The state DOT rerouted the west end of NC 24 from US 74 to I-77 (Exit 18). This was facilitated by following Harris Boulevard in east Charlotte instead of following NC 27\\\\. This added nearly onto the highway's length. On December 8, 2008, Interstate 485 opened in Northwest Mecklenburg County; at that same time NC 24 was extended again by to the new freeway (Exit 21) along West WT Harris Boulevard. Before this rerouting, NC 24 was extraneous west of Johnsonville. It was concurrent with NC 27 over its entire length to its terminus at US 74, at which point NC 27 continued while NC 24 did not. NC 24's eastern terminus is at US 70 in Morehead City. This eastern segment leading to the terminus provides access to communities on the mainland side of the Bogue Sound. North Carolina Highway 243 North Carolina Highway 243 (NC 243) appeared in 1931 as a renumbering of NC 24 from Hubert to Swansboro; which NC 24 went northeast to Stella then east towards Morehead City. In 1934, NC 243 was reverted to NC 24 when the White River bridge was completed in Swansboro. North Carolina Highway 605 North Carolina Highway 605 (NC 605) was established in 1932 as a new primary route between US 1/US 15/NC 50/NC 75, in Tramway, and US 421/NC 60, in Jonesboro.

Fish. It was published in 1963. The plot follows Ivan Dragomiloff, who, in a twist of fate, finds himself pitted against the secret assassination agency he founded. The novel was based on a story idea London purchased from author Sinclair Lewis (Elmer Gantry) in early 1910. London wrote 20,000 words of the novel before he gave it up later that same year, saying he could not find a logical way to conclude it. He died in 1916, leaving the book unfinished. The novel is about a secret organization, The Assassination Bureau, Ltd., that will assassinate evildoers, for example, corrupt police commissioners, legislators, politicians, etc.; but will not act unless convinced that the target truly is worthy of assassination. In 1963, mystery writer Fish completed the novel based on the unfinished manuscript with additional notes by London and an ending outline done by London's widow Charmian shortly before her death in 1955.  First sentence  \\"He was a handsome man, with large liquid-black eyes, an olive complexion that was laid upon a skin clear, clean, and of surpassing smoothness of texture, and with a mop of curly black hair that invited fondling ‚Äì in short, the kind of a man that women like to look upon, and also, the kind of a man who is quite thoroughly aware of this insinuative quality of his looks.\\"  Film adaptation  In 1969, The Assassination Bureau, Ltd was made into a film, The Assassination Bureau Limited, starring Diana Rigg, Oliver Reed, Telly Savalas and Curt Jurgens. Directed by Basil Dearden, the film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 1970 for Best English-Language Foreign Film, and Rigg was nominated for a Golden Laurel Award in 1970 for Female New Face. Whereas London's novel is set in the United States, the film is set in Europe in the 1900s.

Overvoltages on transmission lines, due to atmospheric electricity, lightning strikes, or electrical faults, can cause arcs across insulators (flashovers) that can damage them. Alternately, atmospheric conditions or transients that occur during switching can cause an arc to form in the breaking path of a switch during its operation. Arcing horns provide a path for flashover to occur that bypasses the surface of the protected device. Horns are normally paired on either side of an insulator, one connected to the high voltage part and the other to ground, or at the breaking point of a switch contact. They are frequently to be seen on insulator strings on overhead lines, or protecting transformer bushings. The horns can take various forms, such as simple cylindrical rods, circular guard rings, or contoured curves, sometimes known as 'stirrups'.  Background  High voltage equipment, particularly that which is installed outside, such as overhead power lines, is commonly subject to transient overvoltages, which may be caused by phenomena such as lightning strikes, faults on other equipment, or switching surges during circuit re-energisation. Overvoltage events such as these are unpredictable, and in general cannot be completely prevented. Line terminations, at which a transmission line connects to a busbar or transformer bushing, are at greatest risk to overvoltage due to the change in characteristic impedance at this point. An electrical insulator serves to provide physical separation of conducting parts, and under normal operating conditions is continuously subject to a high electric field which occupies the air surrounding the equipment. Overvoltage events may cause the electric field to exceed the dielectric strength of air and result in the formation of an arc between the conducting parts and over the surface of the insulator. This is called flashover. Contamination of the surface of the insulator reduces the breakdown strength and increases the tendency to flash over. On an electrical transmission system, protective relays are expected to detect the formation of the arc and automatically open circuit breakers to discharge the circuit and extinguish the arc. Under a worst case, this process may take as long as several seconds, during which time the insulator surface would be in close contact with the highly energetic plasma of the arc. This is very damaging to an insulator, and may shatter brittle glass or ceramic disks, resulting in its complete failure.  Operation  Arcing horns protecting bushings on a distribution transformer Arcing horns form a spark gap across the insulator with a lower breakdown voltage than the air path along the insulator surface, so an overvoltage will cause the air to break down and the arc to form between the arcing horns, diverting it away from the surface of the insulator. An arc between the horns is more tolerable for the equipment, providing more time for the fault to be detected and the arc to be safely cleared by remote circuit breakers. The geometry of some designs encourages the arc to migrate away from the insulator, driven by rising currents as it heats the surrounding air. As it does so, the path length increases, cooling the arc, reducing the electric field and causing the arc to extinguish itself when it can no longer span the gap. Other designs can utilise the magnetic field produced by the high current to drive the arc away from the insulator. This type of arrangement can be known as a magnetic blowout. Design criteria and maintenance regimes may treat arcing horns as sacrificial equipment, cheaper and more easily replaced than the insulator, failure of which can result in complete destruction of the equipment it insulates. Failure of insulator strings on overhead lines could result in the parting of the line, with significant safety and cost implications. Arcing horns thus play a role in the process of correlating system protection with protective device characteristics, known as insulation coordination. The horns should provide, amongst other characteristics, near- infinite impedance during normal operating conditions to minimise conductive current losses, low impedance during the flashover, and physical resilience to the high temperature of the arc. As operating voltages increase, greater consideration must be given to such design principles. At medium voltages, one of the two horns may be omitted as the horn-to-horn gap can otherwise be small enough to be bridged by an alighting bird. Alternatively, duplex gaps consisting of two sections on opposite sides of the insulator can be fitted. Low voltage distribution systems, in which the risk of arcing is much lower, may not use arcing horns at all. The presence of the arcing horns necessarily disturbs the normal electric field distribution across the insulator due to their small but significant capacitance. More importantly, a flashover across arcing horns produces an earth fault resulting in a circuit outage until the fault is cleared by circuit breaker operation. For this reason, non-linear resistors known as varistors can replace arcing horns at critical locations.  Switch protection  Arcing horns are sometimes installed on air-insulated switchgear and transformers to protect the switch arm from arc damage. When a high voltage switch breaks a circuit, an arc can establish itself between the switch contacts before the current can be interrupted. The horns are designed to endure the arc rather than the contact surfaces of the switch itself. Corona and grading rings Arcing horns are not to be confused with corona rings (or the similar grading rings) which are ring-shaped assemblies surrounding connectors, or other irregular hardware pieces on high potential equipment. Corona rings and grading rings are intended to equalize and redistribute accumulated potential away from components that might be subject to local accumulation and destructive discharges, although sometimes either device may be installed in close proximity to an arcing horn assembly.

Education  Martin was born in Chicago to Ukrainian Jewish Immigrants. He graduated from Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in 1950. After graduating he served as a submarine officer during the Korean War. In 1957, he earned his master's degree from IIT in electrical engineering and in 2004 received an honorary doctorate degree from IIT. He serves on the university's board of trustees.  Career   Motorola  Cooper left his first job at Teletype Corporation in Chicago in 1954 and joined Motorola, Inc. (Schaumburg, Illinois) as a senior development engineer in the mobile equipment group. He developed products including the first cellular-like portable handheld police radio system, produced for the Chicago police department in 1967.

By the early 1970s, Cooper headed Motorola's communications systems division. Here he conceived of the first portable cellular phone in 1973 and led the 10-year process of bringing it to market. Car phones had been in limited use in large U.S. cities since the 1930s but Cooper championed cellular telephony for more general personal, portable communications.Best Inventions of 2007, Time. He believed the cellular phone should be a \\"personal telephone ‚Äì something that would represent an individual so you could assign a number; not to a place, not to a desk, not to a home, but to a person.\\" While it has been stated Cooper's vision for the device was inspired by Captain James T. Kirk using his Communicator on the television show Star Trek, Cooper himself later said that his actual inspiration was Dick Tracy's wrist radio. Top management at Motorola supported Cooper's mobile phone concept, investing $100 million between 1973 and 1993 before any revenues were realized.Inventor of the Cell Phone Says No to AT&T-Mobile;, Yes to Apps, and More, PC Magazine, April 15, 2011 Cooper assembled a team that designed and assembled a product in less than 90 days. That original handset, called the DynaTAC 8000x (DYNamic Adaptive Total Area Coverage) weighed 2.5 pounds (1.1 kg), measured 10 inches (25 cm) long and was dubbed \\"the brick\\" or \\"the shoe\\" phone.Inventor of Cell Phone: We Knew Someday Everybody Would Have One, CNN, July 9, 2010 A very substantial part of the DynaTAC was the battery, which weighed four to five times more than a modern cell phone. The phone had only 30 minutes of talk time before requiring a 10-hour recharge but according to Cooper, \\"The battery lifetime wasn't really a problem because you couldn't hold that phone up for that long!\\" By 1983 and after four iterations, the handset was reduced to half its original weight. Cooper is the lead inventor named on \\"radio telephone system\\" filed on October 17, 1973, with the U.S. Patent Office and later issued as U.S. Patent 3,906,166.Cooper, Martin et al. \\"All Signaling\\" , Issued September 1, 1975 John Francis Mitchell, Motorola's Chief of Portable Communication Products (and Cooper's Manager and Mentor) and the engineers who worked for Cooper and Mitchell are also named on the patent. On April 3, 1973, Cooper and Mitchell demonstrated two working phones to the media and to passers-by prior to walking into a scheduled press conference at the New York City Hilton in midtown Manhattan. Standing on Sixth avenue near the Hilton, Cooper made the first handheld cellular phone call in public from the prototype DynaTAC. The call connected him to a base station Motorola had installed on the roof of the Burlington House (now the AllianceBernstein Building) and into the AT&T; land-line telephone system. Reporters and onlookers watched as Cooper dialed the number of his chief competitor Dr. Joel S. Engel at AT&T.;April 3, 1973: Motorola Calls AT&T...by; Cell, Wired, April 3, 2008 \\"Joel, this is Marty. I'm calling you from a cell phone, a real handheld portable cell phone.\\"Twitter, Telegram and Email: Famous First Lines, BBC News, March 21, 2011 That public demonstration landed the DynaTAC on the July 1973 cover of Popular Science Magazine. As Cooper recalls from the experience: \\"I made numerous calls, including one where I crossed the street while talking to a New York radio reporter ‚Äì probably one of the most dangerous things I have ever done in my life.\\" Cooper holding a DynaTAC cellphone in 2007 That first cell phone began a fundamental technology and communications market shift to making phone calls to a person instead of to a place. Bell Labs had introduced the idea of cellular communications in 1947, but their first systems were limited to car phones which required roughly 30 pounds (12 kg) of equipment in the trunk. Motorola gained Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval for cellular licenses to be assigned to competing entities and prevented an AT&T; monopoly on cellular service. Cooper worked at Motorola for 29 years; building and managing both its paging and cellular businesses. He also led the creation of trunked mobile radio, quartz crystals, oscillators, liquid crystal displays, piezo-electric components, Motorola A. M. stereo technology and various mobile and portable two-way radio product lines. Cooper rose to Vice-President and Corporate Director of Research and Development at Motorola. In addition to his work on the mobile cellular phone, he was instrumental in expanding the technology of pagers from use within a single building to use across multiple cities. Cooper also worked with inventor Clifford L. Rose to fix a flaw in quartz crystals used in Motorola's radios which encouraged the company to mass-produce the first crystals used in wrist watches.  Cellular Business Systems   Dyna LLC  Arlene Harris Cooper and his wife Arlene Harris founded Dyna LLC in 1986 as a home base for their developmental and support activities for the new companies, Subscriber Computing Inc., Cellular Pay Phone, Inc. (CPPI), SOS Wireless Communications and Accessible Wireless; the later two of which together created the underpinning for the creation of GreatCall, were all launched from Dyna LLC. From his Dyna headquarters Cooper continues to write and lecture about wireless communications, technological innovation, the Internet and R&D; management. He serves on industry, civic and national governmental groups including the U.S. Department of Commerce Spectrum Advisory Committee that advises the Secretary of Commerce of the United States on spectrum policy and the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) Technological Advisory Council.  GreatCall, Inc  In 1986 Cooper co- founded Cellular Payphone Inc.

Arraycomm  In 1992 Cooper co-founded Arraycomm a developer of software for mobile antenna technologies. Under his leadership, the Company grew from a seed-funded startup in San Jose, California, into the world leader in smart antenna technology with 400 patents issued or pending, worldwide.Antennas Get Smart, Scientific American, June 9, 2003  Energous.com Cooper joined the board of directors from 2015 to 2019.  Cooper's law  Cooper found that the ability to transmit different radio communications simultaneously and in the same place has grown at the same pace since Guglielmo Marconi's first transmissions in 1895. This led Cooper to formulate the Law of Spectral Efficiency, otherwise known as Cooper's Law. The law states that the maximum number of voice conversations or equivalent data transactions that can be conducted in all of the useful radio spectrum over a given area doubles every 30 months.

His father was the economic historian Paul Bairoch. Education His first project, as a Ph.D. student was the development of PC/Gene, an MS-DOS based software package for the analysis of protein and nucleotide sequences. PC/Gene was commercialized, first by a Swiss company (Genofit) then by Intelligenetics in the US which was later bought by Oxford Molecular. Research His main work is in the field of protein sequence analysis and more particularly in the development of databases and software tools for this purpose. His most important contribution is the input of human knowledge by careful manual annotation in protein- related data. While working on PC/Gene he started to develop an annotated protein sequence database which became Swiss-Prot and was first released in July 1986. -- a historical account by Bairoch. From 1988 onward it has been a collaborative project with the Data Library group of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory which later evolved into the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). The Swiss-Prot database is the primary protein sequence resource in the world and has been a key research instrument for both bioinformaticians and laboratory-based scientists in a very wide range of applications. A measure of its success is the recent development of UniProt, the world's most comprehensive catalogue of information on proteins. UniProt is a central information resource of protein sequences and functions created by joining the information contained in Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL, and the American Protein Information Resource (PIR) databases. In 1988, he started to develop PROSITE, a database of protein families and domains. A little while later he created ENZYME, a nomenclature database on enzymes as well as SeqAnalRef, a sequence analysis bibliographic reference database. In collaboration with Ron Appel he initiated, in August 1993, the first molecular biology WWW server, ExPASy. What was intended as a prototype grew rapidly into a major site that provides access to the many databases produced partially or completely in Geneva as well as many tools for the analysis of proteins (proteomics). In 1998, with colleagues in Geneva and Lausanne, he was one of the founders of the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, whose mission is to establish in Switzerland a center of excellence in the field of bioinformatics with an emphasis on research, education, services and the developments of databases and tools. In November 1997, together with Ron Appel and Denis Hochstrasser, he founded GeneBio (Geneva Bioinformatics SA), a company involved in biological knowledge. In April 2000, the above persons with Keith Rose and Robin Offord founded GeneProt (Geneva Proteomics), a high throughput proteomics company that ceased operations in 2005. Since 2009, in the framework of the CALIPHO group, directed by himself and Lydie Lane, he is involved in the development of neXtProt a resource which aims to provide life scientists with a broad spectrum of knowledge on all human proteins. He is also involved in the development of the Cellosaurus a knowledge resource on cell lines. According to Google Scholar and Scopus, his most highly cited peer reviewed papers in scientific journals have been published in Nucleic Acids Research, the Biochemical Journal, Nature, Briefings in Bioinformatics, and Database.

She worked for several agencies of the American government and her work also featured in several news and photographic magazines. Life and career Esther Bubley was born in Phillips, Wisconsin, the fourth of five children of Russian Jewish immigrants Louis and Ida Bubley. In 1936, while Esther was a senior at Central High School in Superior, Wisconsin, the photo magazine Life first hit the newsstands. Inspired by the magazine, and particularly by the pictures of the Great Depression produced by the Farm Security Administration, she developed a passion for photojournalism and documentary photography. As editor-in-chief of the yearbook, she sought to emulate the style of Life. After high school, Bubley spent two years at Superior State Teachers College (now the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìSuperior) before enrolling in the one-year photography program at the Minneapolis School of Art (now the Minneapolis College of Art and Design). A student at Woodrow Wilson High School, Washington DC, 1943 After college in 1941, Bubley moved to Washington, D.C. seeking work as a photographer. Failing to find a job in Washington, Bubley moved to New York City. During the 1941 Christmas season, she landed a position at Vogue in New York, but she didn't like the work. Early in 1942, she returned to Washington when she was offered a job as a microfilmer for the National Archives and Records Administration. In the fall of 1942, Roy Stryker hired her as a darkroom assistant at the Office of War Information (OWI), where his photographic unit had recently been transferred from the Farm Security Administration.Library of Congress With the encouragement of Stryker, and some of the more senior photographers, she moved to taking pictures for the OWI historical section, documenting life on the home front during the war. Her most challenging assignment was a noted series on the bus system in the Midwest and South. \\"An instructor of the Capital transit company...\\", photograph of a streetcar driver, traditionally male job being done by a woman during World War II, by Esther Bubley, June 1943 In late 1943, when Stryker left the OWI to work on a public relations project for the Standard Oil Company (New Jersey), she accompanied him, along with other photographers, including Gordon Parks and John Vachon. The Bus Story series she produced for Standard Oil, a reprise of her earlier Bus Story for the OWI, earned the award for Best Picture Sequence in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica/University of Missouri School of Journalism \\"News Pictures of the Year\\" in 1948. During this period, she was briefly married to Edwin Locke, Stryker's administrative chief, but they soon divorced. By 1947, Bubley was expanding her horizons beyond Stryker and Standard Oil. She began working for the Children's Bureau, a federal child welfare agency. Over the next several years, she contributed thousands of images to their files, and her work appeared on more than thirty covers of their journal The Child. In 1949, Bubley's photo essay on mental illness for the Ladies' Home Journal was given the first place award for a feature in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica/University of Missouri School of Journalism contest, winning Bubley a second set of the Encyclopedia. She continued working for the Ladies' Home Journal, producing a dozen photo stories for their celebrated series \\"How America Lives,\\" which ran intermittently between 1948 and 1960. In 1951, Bubley began to freelance for Life, eventually contributing 40 photo stories, including two cover stories. Bubley was one of the first women to successfully support herself working as a freelance photographer for the major magazines. In 1951, she also produced a series on the Pittsburgh Children's Hospital for Stryker, who was then establishing the Pittsburgh Photographic Library. Edward Steichen, Directory of Photography at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), used 13 prints from this series in the 1952 exhibition Diogenese with a Camera. He also mounted and displayed her contact sheets to show how she used every frame. This series led to medical themes becoming a major part of her portfolio. In 1953, she was hired by UNICEF and the French government to travel to Morocco to photograph a program to treat trachoma, an infectious disease that causes blindness. Bubley entered a photo from this assignment in the international division of a contest sponsored by Photography magazine in 1954. She became the first woman to win first place, and she received a trophy depicting a male photographer. In 1955, Steichen included her work in his monumental The Family of Man exhibition. In 1956, Pepsi-Cola International hired Bubley to cover Latin America for their company magazine Panorama. In the mid-1960s, Pan American World Airways sent her around the world twice to make images for their corporate photographic library. In the late 1960s, Bubley reduced her workload as sales of photographic magazines declined, and she wearied of the grueling travel schedule. She spent more time at home in New York City where she pursued projects of personal interest, producing two children's books about animals and a book featuring macro photography of plants. A devoted animal lover, she spent her mornings in Central Park walking her dog, taking photographs, and making notes that she hoped to turn into a book about the park. In 1991 the Minneapolis College of Art and Design awarded Bubley an honorary doctorate. She died in New York City, of cancer, on March 16, 1998. In 2001 a retrospective exhibition of Bubley's work appeared at the UBS Art Gallery in New York City. In 2005 Aperture Foundation published a monograph about Bubley, Esther Bubley: On Assignment by photographic historian Bonnie Yochelson with Tracy A. Schmid, archivist for the Bubley Estate. In 2010, the Library of Congress published the monograph Fields of Vision: The Photographs of Esther Bubley.

The single managed to gain word-of-mouth success and made #60 on the UK top 75- their first of 25 hit singles to date. The song is featured on the original Gran Turismo game as an instrumental. Grant once said that the song is about the struggles the band experienced while trying to get a record contract. Music video The music video (directed by Toby Duckett) begins with a first person camera sequence of being let in by a doorman to a squat known as Oddballs Hall. The now demolished building at the junction of Harrow Rd and Ladbroke Grove in London where Feeder are performing in a dingy hall which features rats, several arcade machines, a giant fiberglass wolf head and a man in a bathtub filled with tangerines. One end of the hall was covered with mirrors which were smashed for effect during the filming but the process proved to be too dangerous to all concerned so does not appear in the finished piece. Several slow-motion sequences occur during the performance in which tangerines fly at the band as they leap through the air, drummer Jon Lee's bass drum is also filled with tangerines. In keeping with the orange-based image of the song (and of the band at the time) the band wear several orange items of clothing during the video, including their then-trademark orange jumpsuits. At the end of the performance the camera returns to first person, leaves the building and returns to the street.

West's first novel, it presents a young man's immature and cynical search for meaning in a series of dreamlike encounters inside the entrails of the Trojan Horse. Plot summary Balso, the protagonist, comes across the Trojan Horse in the tall grass around Troy and promptly seeks a way to get in: ‚Äúthe mouth was beyond his reach, the navel provided a cul-de-sac, and so, forgetting his dignity, he approached the last. O Anus Mirabilis!‚Äù The literary critic Leslie Fiedler reads much into this and sees the whole novel as ‚Äúa fractured and dissolving parable of the very process by which the emancipated Jew enters into the world of Western Culture.‚Äù Fiedler, Leslie. ‚ÄúMaster of Dreams, the Jew in a Gentile World.‚Äù The Collected Essays of Leslie Fiedler. New York: Stein and Day, 1970. 183. Inside the Trojan Horse Balso encounters an array of odd characters who, he realizes, are all ‚Äúwriters in search of an audience‚Äù. These characters also represent various religious and artistic ideals. Balso hears their stories systematically, only to discard them one by one, in a strictly nihilist fashion. Literary significance and criticism The lack of a coherent plot structure, the juvenile humor and the abundant scatological details are all intended to aggravate, perplex and annoy readers. The desired result, according to West, is a book that is ‚Äúa protest against writing books‚Äù.quoted in Raban, Jonathan. ‚ÄúA Surfeit of Commodities: The Novels of Nathanael West.‚Äù American fiction, 1914-1945. New York: Chelsea House, 1987. 378. The juvenileness and incoherence of the novel prompt critics to disregard it as merely ‚Äúa sneer in the bathroom mirror at Art‚Äù (Alan RossRoss, Alan. ‚ÄúThe Dead Center: An Introduction to Nathanael West.‚Äù The Complete Works of Nathanael West. New York: Farrar, Straus & Cudahy, 1957. xii.), ‚Äúsqualid and dreadful‚Äù (Harold BloomBloom, Harold. Introduction. American fiction, 1914-1945.

Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1971. 64.). Nevertheless, by its complete and disgusted rejection of all religious, political and artistic ideals The Dream Life of Balso Snell foreshadows the nihilism of West‚Äôs next novels. Publication history West began developing material for The Dream Life of Balso Snell as early as 1924; he worked on the novel during his stay in Paris in 1926 and finished a complete draft in New York City between 1927 and 1929, under the title The Journal of Balso Snell. The manuscript was rejected twice before finally getting accepted, largely due to a favorable appraisal by William Carlos Williams. The book was published in New York City by the Paris- based Contact Editions in August 1931 in an edition of 500 copies. There were no other printings during West‚Äôs lifetime. After West became famous (years after his death) for Miss Lonelyhearts and The Day of the Locust, Balso Snell was reprinted in a single volume edition of his complete novels, as well as in the Library of America edition of West's collected works.West, Nathanael.

Description Skeleton viewed from above, National Technical University of Athens, Greece Size comparison. Limaysaurus was a medium-sized sauropod. Gregory S. Paul in 2010 estimated its length at fifteen meters (50 ft) and its weight at seven tonnes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press, pp. 186 and 208. The neural spines on its back were very tall. The neural spines of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae are not V-shaped but they have a simple and straight form like an I. Its teeth were curved, unlike those of Diplodocus which were pencil-shaped. Another distinct characteristic of this sauropod is its phylogenetic relationship to Rebbachisaurus from Morocco. This discovery supports the theory that there was a land bridge connecting South America to Africa 100 million years ago.Calvo, Jorge and Salgado, Leonardo (1996). A land bridge connection between South America and Africa during Albian-Cenomanian times based on sauropod dinosaur evidences. 39¬∞ Congresso Brasileiro de Geolog√≠a , Anais (7): 392-393. It shared its habitat with Andesaurus and Giganotosaurus, characterized by plains with large and shallow lagoons. The climate was mild and humid. In fossil remains of Limaysaurus, gastroliths have been found, which were used to help the stomach to grind food. Discovery Limaysaurus includes a single type species, Limaysaurus tessonei, which was originally referred to the genus Rebbachisaurus as Rebbachisaurus tessonei, an African species, by Jorge Calvo and Leonardo Salgado in 1995.Calvo, J. O. and Salgado, L. (1995). \\"Rebbachisaurus tessonei sp. nov. A new sauropod from the Albian-Cenomanian of Argentina; new evidence on the origin of the Diplodocidae.\\" Gaia, 11: 13-33. However, a generic separation was proposed by Salgado, Alberto Garrido, Sergio Cocca and Juan Cocca, and the genus Limaysaurus was named in 2004. The generic name is derived from R√≠o Limay which borders the region and from the specific name, tessonei, in honor of Lieto Tessone, who found the first and most complete holotype. Their discovery shed some light on the distribution of Gondwanan dinosaurs in the mid- Cretaceous period. Several specimens of Limaysaurus are known, one of which (the holotype) is 80% complete, being one of the most complete Cretaceous sauropods ever found in South America. The holotype specimen, MUCPv-205, a partial skeleton including the back of the skull, was found in 1988 by Lieto Francisco Tessone, who is honoured in the specific name. It was afterwards collected, together with MUCPv-206, a second fragmentary skeleton, by Jos√© Bonaparte. These two adult specimens likely hailed from the top of the Candeleros Formation, which is dated to the early Cenomanian age. An additional smaller specimen, MUCPv-153, was found nearby, although it belonged to the base of the Huincul Formation, from the late Cenomanian. Limaysaurus was found 15 km (9 mi) southwest of Villa El Choc√≥n, Pic√∫n Leuf√∫ Department, Neuqu√©n Province, Patagonia, Argentina. The sediments belong to the R√≠o Limay Subgroup, in Lohan Cura Formation, at Cerro Aguada del Le√≥n.These beds appear to date from the Aptian-Albian interval, although these fossils were later named Comahuesaurus Head and neck of a Limaysaurus tessonei in front of a Giganotosaurus Classification The describing authors in 2004 assigned Limaysaurus to the famlily Rebbachisauridae. The rebbachisaurids are a basal clade within the Diplodocimorpha, and their remains have been found in Cretaceous-age rocks in Europe, South America, and Africa. A cladistic analysis of macronarian sauropods (Salgado et al., 2004) demonstrated close affinities between Limaysaurus, the African genera Rebbachisaurus and Nigersaurus, and the South American genera Rayososaurus and Cathartesaura.

She retired from the Oakland City Council in 2012; her seat is currently held by Lynette Gibson McElhaney. Nadel is the founder of a chocolate business. Background Nadel graduated from Alfred University in 1966 with a B.A. in Fine arts, from S.F. State in 1979 with a B.S. in Geology, and from UC Berkeley in 1981 with a M.S. in Engineering geoscience. Prior to joining the Council, she was a teacher, an artist, a geophysicist, an oil and gas industry scientist,, a small business owner and an environmental engineer with the U.S. E.P.A.. Her writings on water policy, affirmative action, environmental justice and sustainable development have been published in journals and periodicals. EBMUD and ABAG Nadel began her political career on the Board of Directors of the East Bay Municipal Utility District where she served two terms. She is a member of the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) Executive Committee, ABAG Regional Planning Committee, and chairs the ABAG Earthquake Hazards Outreach Review Committee. Oakland City Council Nadel was elected to Oakland's District Three \\"Downtown-West Oakland\\" City Council seat in 1996. The district includes Adams Point, most of Oakland's Central Business District (CBD) including all of Downtown and the Lakeside Apartments District, but excluding the Civic Center district south of 14th Street, and Chinatown. District Three also includes Jack London Square, the Jack London District, Pill Hill, and West Oakland. Nadel is the current chair of the City Council's Public Works Committee. 2008 City Council Election On Tuesday June 3, 2008, in the 2008 District 3 City Council election, Nadel was re- elected for her fourth consecutive term with 51.6% of the vote, narrowly avoiding a run-off election. Her two challengers, both West Oakland residents as is Nadel, were Sean Sullivan, Oakland Covenant House Director, who finished with 27%, and Oakland attorney Greg Hodge, who was elected to the Oakland School Board in 2000 and 2004, who garnered 20% of the vote. Community building coordinator Africa Williams ran as a write-in candidate. During the election, Nadel was the subject of ballot access controversy after one of her opponents, Greg Hodge, filed for ballot access with what a judge would later rule to be the required signatures. On March 14, 2008, two Nadel supporters, one of whom is an Oakland Attorney who made a contribution to Nadel's campaign on March 7, inspected the signatures on Hodge's petition to access the ballot. They scrutinized the address of one of the voters who signed the petition, which led to the City Clerk reversing her decision. Nadel maintains she played no role in striking Hodge's name from the ballot Hodge ended up filing suit for successful reinstatement to the ballot. Policy initiatives =2009 ballot measure= She favors a US$45 parcel tax, however she would like to spend 45% of it on arts and culture programs to the detriment of the Oakland Zoo, Chabot Space and Science Center, and Oakland Museum of California.Potential ballot measures under consideration in Oakland, by Kelly Rayburn, Oakland Tribune, February 24, 2009, access date 08-03-2209 =2009 youth curfew proposal= She is opposed to a proposal for a youth curfew to keep child prostitutes off the streets, claiming increased contact with the police will be traumatic for them and that instead increased youth services and activities would be of better use.Timing \\"Not So Perfect\\" for Youth Curfew Law in Oakland, by Rachel Swan, East Bay Express, February 11, 2009, access date 08-03-2009 This explanation was decried as \\"absurd\\" since other council members said it was \\"ridiculous\\" to expect youth centers to be open at 2 or 3 AM and that there was no good reason for minors to be out that late at night. The curfew would have allowed police to take minors to their guardians or to a reception center with counseling services between the hours of 10PM (11PM Friday and Saturday) and 5AM. =Anti-cronyism= During the context of the 2008 Anti-Nepotism ordinance, Nadel wanted the ordinance to go beyond nepotism to include \\"cronyism\\" or any questionable relationship involving city workers. \\"I personally know about cronyism things that have occurred so I have no problem putting that in. The cronyism and nepotism is legendary and it goes back for 30 years.\\" After initially opposing an earlier version of the anti- nepotism ordinance along with fellow Councilmember Jane Brunner, which died in the Finance and Management Agency Committee in September 2008, a revised version of the ordinance proposal passed the full Council on November 18, 2008 on a 6-0 vote with the cronyism amendment attached. =West Oakland Youth Center= In 2008, Nadel attempted to unilaterally approve her pet project, the West Oakland Youth Center, by Chris Thompson, East Bay Express, September 18, 2008, access date 09-23-2018 which was finally built for a cost of 8 million dollars, and remained empty in 2013 due to the inability to produce operational funds by Christin Ayers, KPIX 5, November 22, 2013, access date 09-23-2018 It remains closed as of September 23, 2018. =Staff= Nadel's official City Council staff of three full-time public servants includes a scheduler, a constituent liaison, and a policy aide. =Constituent outreach= For several years, Nadel scheduled monthly \\"Constituent Coffee Hours\\" at World Ground Cafe in the Jack London District. In the fall of 2008, Nadel ended these open monthly meetings, preferring instead to meet directly with the Board of the Jack London District Association (JLDA), a neighborhood association. Her last Coffee Hours was scheduled for Saturday, October 25, 2008. 2006 Mayoral campaign Nadel ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Oakland in 2006, placing third of six candidates, behind City Council President Ignacio De La Fuente who finished in second place behind the winner, former mayor Ron Dellums. Businesswoman Nadel is the founder of a locally operated chocolate-making business and sources the company's cocoa beans from Jamaica. Personal life A West Oakland resident, Nadel is the widow of Chappell Hayes, and mother of an adult daughter.

Like B. bronchiseptica, B. pertussis is motile and expresses a flagellum-like structure. Its virulence factors include pertussis toxin, adenylate cyclase toxin, filamentous h√¶magglutinin, pertactin, fimbria, and tracheal cytotoxin. The bacterium is spread by airborne droplets; its incubation period is 7‚Äì10 days on average (range 6‚Äì20 days).Heymann, David L. (ed): Pertussis; in Control of Communicable Diseases Manual. p. 457. American Public Health Association, Washington DC, 2008, Humans are the only known reservoir for B. pertussis. The complete B. pertussis genome of 4,086,186 base pairs was published in 2003. Compared to its closest relative B. bronchiseptica, the genome size is greatly reduced. This is mainly due to the adaptation to one host species (human) and the loss of capability of survival outside of a host body.  History  The disease pertussis was first described by French physician Guillaume de Baillou after the epidemic of 1578. The causative agent of pertussis was identified and isolated by Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou in 1906.  Taxonomy  The genus Bordetella contains nine species: B. pertussis B. parapertussis, B. bronchiseptica, B. avium, B. hinzii, B. holmesii, B. trematum, B. ansorpii and B.petrii. B. pertussis, B. parapertussis and B. bronchiseptica form a closely related phylogenetical group. B. parapertussis causes a disease similar to whooping cough in humans, and B. bronchiseptica infects a range of mammal hosts, including humans, and causes a spectrum of respiratory disorders. Pertussis Pertussis is an infection of the respiratory system characterized by a ‚Äúwhooping‚Äù sound when the person breathes in. In the US, it killed between 10,000 and 20,000 people per year before a vaccine was available. Vaccination has transformed this; between 1985 and 1988, fewer than 100 children died from pertussis. Worldwide in 2000, according to the WHO, around 39 million people were infected annually and about 297,000 died. Since the introduction of vaccination in England in 1957, the rate of pertussis infection has dropped by 97%. B. pertussis infects its host by colonizing lung epithelial cells. The bacterium contains a surface protein, filamentous haemagglutinin adhesin, which binds to the sulfatides found on cilia of epithelial cells. Other adhesins are fimbriae and petractin. Once anchored, the bacterium produces tracheal cytotoxin, which stops the cilia from beating. This prevents the cilia from clearing debris from the lungs, so the body responds by sending the host into a coughing fit. These coughs expel some bacteria into the air, which can then infect other hosts. B. pertussis has the ability to inhibit the function of the host's immune system. The toxin, known as pertussis toxin (or PTx), inhibits G protein coupling that regulates an adenylate cyclase-mediated conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP. The end result is that phagocytes convert too much ATP to cAMP, causing disturbances in cellular signaling mechanisms, and preventing phagocytes from correctly responding to the infection. PTx, formerly known as lymphocytosis- promoting factor, causes a decrease in the entry of lymphocytes into lymph nodes, which can lead to a condition known as lymphocytosis, with a complete lymphocyte count of over 4000/Œºl in adults or over 8000/Œºl in children. Beside targeting lymphocytes, it limits neutrophil migration to the lungs. It also decreases the function of tissue-resident macrophages, which are responsible for some bacterial clearance. Another toxin that inhibits the immune response is the adenylate cyclase toxin. This toxin has an intrinsic adenylate cyclase activity, increasing intracellular cAMP almost immediately. It is also able to form cation-specific pores in the membrane of the target cell. The resulting deregulation of cell signaling leads to blocking of phagocytosis and reduction in the ability of neutrophils to kill bacteria. It also inhibits maturation of dendritic cells and their migration to the lymph nodes. The infection occurs mostly in children under the age of one when they are unimmunized, or children with faded immunity, normally around the ages 11 through 18. The signs and symptoms are similar to a common cold: runny nose, sneezing, mild cough, and low-grade fever. The patient becomes most contagious during the catarrhal stage of infection, normally two weeks after the coughing begins. It may become airborne when the person coughs, sneezes, or laughs. The paroxysmal cough precedes a crowing inspiratory sound characteristic of pertussis. After a spell, the patient might make a ‚Äúwhooping‚Äù sound when breathing in, or may vomit. Adults have milder symptoms, such as prolonged coughing without the ‚Äúwhoop‚Äù. Infants less than six months also may not have the typical whoop. A coughing spell may last a minute or more, producing cyanosis, apnoea, and seizures. However, when not in a coughing fit, the patient does not experience trouble breathing. This is because B. pertussis inhibits the immune response, so very little mucus is generated in the lungs. A prolonged cough may be irritating and sometimes a disabling cough may go undiagnosed in adults for many months.  Prevention  Pertussis vaccine has been widely used since the second half of the 20th century. The first vaccines were whole-cell vaccines, composed of chemically inactivated bacteria. They are being replaced by acellular vaccines, composed of purified surface antigens, mainly fimbriae, filamentous haemaglutinin, pertactin and pertussis toxin. It is part of the diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) immunization. As a zoonotic disease Uncertainties of B. pertussis and whooping cough as a zoonotic disease have existed since around 1910, but in the 1930s, the bacteria were found to have lost their virulent power when repeatedly spread on agar media. This explained the difficulties in reproducing results from different studies, as the preinoculating handling of the bacteria was not standardized among scientists. At least some primate species are highly sensitive to B. pertussis, and develop a clinical whooping cough in high incidence when exposed to low inoculation doses. Whether the bacteria spread naturally in wild animal populations has not been confirmed satisfactorily by laboratory diagnosis, but whooping cough has been found among wild gorillas. Several zoos have learned to vaccinate their primates against whooping cough. Diagnosis A nasopharyngeal or an oropharynx swab is sent to the bacteriology laboratory for Gram stain (Gram-negative, coccobacilli, diplococci arrangement), growth on Bordet-Gengou agar or BCYE plate with added cephalosporin to select for the organism, which shows mercury drop-like colonies. B. pertussis can also be detected by PCR, which is more sensitive than culture. The primers used for PCR usually target the transposable elements IS481 and IS1001. Several diagnostic tests are available, especially ELISA kits. These are designed to detect FHA and/or PT antibodies of IgG, IgA, or IgM. Some kits use a combination of antigens which lead to a higher sensitivity, but might also make the interpretation of the results harder, since one cannot know which antibody has been detected. The organism is oxidase positive, but urease, nitrate reductase, and citrate negative. It is also motile.  Treatment  Whooping cough is treated by macrolides, for example erythromycin. The therapy is most effective when started during the incubation period or the catarrhal period. When applied during the paroxysmal cough phase, the time of reconvalescence is not affected, only further transmission is prevented.

The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant (also known as Ungrateful Servant, Unmerciful Servant, or Wicked Servant but not to be confused with the parable of the Two Debtors) is a parable of Jesus which appears in the Gospel of Matthew. According to it is important to forgive others as we are forgiven by God, as illustrated by the negative example of the unforgiving servant. Narrative This depiction by Domenico Fetti (c. 1620) shows the unforgiving servant choking the other debtor. The parable is told as an answer to a question by Peter about forgiveness: This depiction by Jan van Hemessen (c. 1556) shows the moment when the king scolds the servant. The lines before the parable itself are similar to . The talent in this parable was worth about 6,000 denarii, so that one debt is 600,000 times as large as the other.R. T. France, The Gospel According to Matthew: An introduction and commentary, Eerdmans, 1985, , p. 277. More significantly, 10,000 (a myriad) was the highest Greek numeral, and a talent the largest unit of currency, so that 10,000 talents was the largest easily described debt (for comparison, the combined annual tribute of Judea, Samaria, and Idumea around this time was only 600 talents,Craig S. Keener, A Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, Eerdmans, 1999, , pp. 456‚Äì461. and one denarius was a day's wages, so that 10,000 talents would be about 200,000 years' wages60,000,000 denarii divided by 6 days per week divided by 50 weeks = 200,000 years' wages.). The setting is the court of some king in another country, where the \\"servants\\" could rank as highly as provincial governors.  Historical context  There is no precedent in the scriptures of the Bible for a debtor paying debts from prison. However, there is a very relevant aspect of Roman law that may have been the cultural reference this parable is built around considering the Judeans of Jesus day were ruled by Rome. In the Roman Constitution known as the Laws of the 12 Tables (Table III, Laws IV-X), there is a detailed set of laws on debtors that shows a great deal of similarity to the scenario in the parable. A debtor who does not pay can be taken to court and put in chains and forced into a number of arrangements whereby they work off the debt through servitude. Also it states that others can come and pay the debt on their behalf, thus releasing them from prison. A debt that cannot be paid resulted in slavery to the creditor or sale on the slave market.

He was acting Governor of Hong Kong in March 1882. Early years Tonnochy was born in Bengal, India in December 1841 to Thomas Tonnochy (a colonial collector in Bulundshahr) and Caroline Kemball. He was of Scottish and Indian extraction: his paternal grandfather was a Scot (Bengal Army Sergeant Major Thomas Tonnochie) and his paternal grandmother, Catharine, was probably Indian. His maternal grandfather was a Conductor of Ordnance and maternal grandmother most likely Indian too. He was sent to England for education at Blackheath Proprietary School followed by Trinity College, Cambridge. Colonial Service in Hong Kong It seems that Tonnochy did not complete his studies at Cambridge, choosing instead to try for a new cadetship in the Hong Kong Civil Service, by competitive examination in 1862. In this he was successful, along with fellow candidates Cecil Clementi Smith and Walter Meredith Deane, the three of them comprising the first appointments on merit in a service that was beginning to modernise.Tsang, Steve.

History The Shiratsuyu-class destroyers were modified versions of the , and were designed to accompany the Japanese main striking force and to conduct both day and night torpedo attacks against the United States Navy as it advanced across the Pacific Ocean, according to Japanese naval strategic projections.Peattie & Evans, Kaigun . Despite being one of the most powerful classes of destroyers in the world at the time of their completion, none survived the Pacific War.Globalsecurity.org, IJN Shiratsuyu class destroyers Murasame, built at the Fujinagata Shipyards in Osaka was laid down on 1 February 1934, launched on 20 June 1935 and commissioned on 7 January 1937. Operational history At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Murasame was assigned to Destroyer Division 2 of Destroyer Squadron 4 of the IJN 2nd Fleet, and had sortied from Mako Guard District as part of the \\"Operation M\\" (the invasion of the Philippines, covering landings at Vigan and Lingayen Gulf). On 26 December, she collided with minesweeper W-20 off of Kaohsiung, Taiwan, suffering minor damage. From January 1942, Murasame participated in operations in the Netherlands East Indies, including the invasions of Tarakan Island, Balikpapan and eastern Java. During the Battle of the Java Sea, Murasame engaged a group of Allied destroyers. In March and April, Murasame was based at Subic Bay, from which she assisted in the invasion of Cebu and the blockade of Manila Bay in the Philippines. In May, she returned to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal for repairs. During the Battle of Midway on 4‚Äì6 June, Murasame was part of the aborted Midway Occupation Force under Admiral Nobutake Kond≈ç. In late July, she transferred to Mergui via Singapore to join the Indian Ocean raiding force, but the operation was cancelled due to developments at Guadalcanal, and she returned to Truk on 21 August. During the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24 August, she was part of the escort for the battleship , and during most of September, she was an escort for the seaplane tender , exploring the Solomon Islands and Santa Cruz Islands for potential base locations. In early October, Murasame participated in two \\"Tokyo Express\\" high speed transport runs to Guadalcanal or Lae, suffering from minor damage on 5 October in an air attack near Shortland Islands, which necessitated a return to Truk for repairs. In late October through the end of November, Murasame made an additional nine \\"Tokyo Express\\" runs. On 25 October 1942 she assisted in rescuing the crew of the cruiser , heavily damaged by aircraft attacks, and the next day took part in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands under Admiral Takeo Kurita. During the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on the night of 12‚Äì13 November 1942, Murasame assisting in sinking the destroyer and damaging the cruiser , as well as possibly torpedoing the cruiser . However, during the battle she was also hit by a shell in her forward boiler, and returned to Truk again for repairs. She continued to patrol from Truk through the end of the year, and returned to Yokosuka for repairs in mid January 1943. In February 1943, Murasame returned to Truk escorting the aircraft carrier , and continued on to Rabaul to resume transport operations to Kolombangara. On the night of 4 March, Murasame and the destroyer are believed to have sunk the submarine . However, that same night they were detected by radar-equipped American ships in Kula Gulf off Vila, after delivering supplies to the Japanese base there. In a short action both Japanese ships were sunk; Murasame broke in two from an \\"extremely violent\\" explosion after being hit by gunfire and torpedoes from the destroyer at position . Of her crew, 128 were killed, but 53 survivors, including her captain, Lieutenant Commander Tanegashima, and squadron commander Captain Masao Tachibana later reached Japanese territory. She was removed from the navy list on 1 April 1943. A memorial monument to the crew of Murasame exists at Kannonzaki, in Yokosuka, Japan.

Its name is of Greek origin (œÉŒ∑ŒºŒ±ŒØŒ± 'flag' + -ŒµŒπœÇ, a plural suffix). The town is located by the southern slopes of the main range of Crimean Mountains at the base of Mount Koshka, west from Yalta. Population: History There are prehistoric dolmens and fortifications nearby; in the Middle Ages the area was under the control of the Byzantine Empire, which built a fortified monastery in the vicinity (and may have given the town its name). As the Byzantine power weakened, the area fell under the control of Genoa, which in its turn gave way to the Ottoman Empire; under the Ottomans the village was ruled from Mangup. By 1778, with the departure of the Christian population, the village was depopulated. Villa Kseniya in Simeiz In 1828 Simeiz came into the ownership of Ivan Akimovich Maltsov, who planted grapevines and fruit orchards; at the start of the 20th century his descendants created a resort, Novy Simoiz, which quickly became one of the most prestigious resorts in the Crimea. This period saw the construction of a park and a number of villas which remain to this day. In 1912 Nicholas II visited with his family. After the October Revolution, Simeiz was nationalized and public sanatoriums were created, mainly specializing in tuberculosis. In 1927 Simeiz was visited by around 10,000 people. During World War II the Germans occupied Simeiz, causing much death and destruction; the town was liberated by the Red Army on April 16, 1944. On May 18 of that year the local Crimean Tatars were exiled to Central Asia. After the war, the resort experienced a rebirth, and the ruins were gone by 1955.

Text . Interpretations Painting of the parable by Rembrandt, showing the workers being paid that evening (1637) The parable has often been interpreted to mean that even those who are converted late in life earn equal rewards along with those converted early, and also that people who convert early in life need not feel jealous of those later converts. An alternative interpretation identifies the early laborers as Jews, some of whom resent the late-comers (Gentiles) being welcomed as equals in God's Kingdom. Both of these interpretations are discussed in Matthew Henry's 1706 Commentary on the Bible.Complete Commentary on the Whole Bible, Matthew Henry, (1706). An alternative interpretation is that all Christians can be identified with the eleventh-hour workers. Arland J. Hultgren writes: \\"While interpreting and applying this parable, the question inevitably arises: Who are the eleventh- hour workers in our day? We might want to name them, such as deathbed converts or persons who are typically despised by those who are longtime veterans and more fervent in their religious commitment. But it is best not to narrow the field too quickly. At a deeper level, we are all the eleventh-hour workers; to change the metaphor, we are all honored guests of God in the kingdom. It is not really necessary to decide who the eleventh-hour workers are. The point of the parable‚Äîboth at the level of Jesus and the level of Matthew's Gospel‚Äîis that God saves by grace, not by our worthiness. That applies to all of us.\\"Arland J. Hultgren, The Parables of Jesus: A Commentary, Eerdmans, 2002, , p. 43. Some commentators have used the parable to justify the principle of a \\"living wage\\",William Sloane Coffin, The collected sermons of William Sloane Coffin: the Riverside years, Volume 1, Westminster John Knox Press, 2008, , p. 109. though generally conceding that this is not the main point of the parable. An example is John Ruskin in the 19th century, who quoted the parable in the title of his book Unto This Last. Ruskin did not discuss the religious meaning of the parable but rather its social and economic implications.

Execution The name split dance comes from the habit that the performers split up in two (or more) groups, one entering the stage from the left, the other from the right, until the two meet in the centre and merge into one or more rows. The performers are always girls, it is rare that boys will join. The dance movements are in essence very simple and limited. Most of the work, making supple, beautiful posures, is done by the hands and the head. The body remains quite stiff, and except for an occasional step or a kneeling, the legs are not much used either. The dress of the girls is like that of the tauolunga, although the red dress is here most popular.

The group was formed in 1970, when keyboardist Keith Emerson left The Nice to form ELP. In 1973, Jackson teamed up again with The Nice drummer Brian \\"Blinky\\" Davison to form Refugee with Patrick Moraz. History After the break-up of The Nice in 1969, each of that group's three members formed a group of his own, and those three groups toured together : Emerson formed Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Davison's group was named Every Which Way, and Jackson appeared with Jackson Heights. Jackson Heights' debut album, King Progress, included a reworking of \\"The Cry Of Eugene\\", a song originally recorded by The Nice, and new material including \\"Doubting Thomas\\" and \\"Insomnia\\". The group, which included Charlie Harcourt on lead guitar, Mario Enrique Covarrubias Tapia on bass and Tommy Sloane on drums, produced a radically different sound from that with which Jackson had become well-known, centred upon songs and led by acoustic guitar played by Lee Jackson mostly. This group disbanded shortly after the first album's release and reformed as a trio featuring pianist Brian Chatton (born 19 July 1948, Bolton, Lancashire) - who played with Jon Anderson's Warriors and Phil Collins's Flaming Youth - and singer/songwriter/guitarist John McBurnie, with Jackson mainly playing bass as well as acoustic guitars. The group left the Charisma label and signed with Vertigo, for whom they recorded three albums, The Fifth Avenue Bus and Ragamuffins Fool (1972) and Bump 'n' Grind (1973). And then the group disbanded when Jackson teamed up with Patrick Moraz and Brian Davison and formed Refugee in 1973.

It is a brutal satire of Horatio Alger's novels and their eternal optimism. Plot summary A Cool Million, as its subtitle suggests, presents ‚Äúthe dismantling of Lemuel Pitkin,‚Äù piece by piece. As a satire of the Horatio Alger myth of success, the novel is evocative of Voltaire‚Äôs Candide, which satirized the philosophical optimism of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Alexander Pope. Pitkin is a typical ‚ÄòSchlemiel‚Äô, stumbling from one situation to the next; he gets robbed, cheated, unjustly arrested, frequently beaten and exploited. In a parallel plot Betty Prail, Pitkin's love interest, is raped, abused, and sold into prostitution. Over the course of the novel Pitkin manages to lose an eye, his teeth, his thumb, his scalp and his leg, but nevertheless retains his optimism and gullibility to the inevitably bitter end. Pitkin‚Äôs troubles, however, don't end with his death. Even after his death he is exploited as a martyr by the ‚ÄòNational Revolutionary Party‚Äô, a political organization led by Shagpoke Whipple, a manipulative former American president. Pitkin's birthday becomes a national holiday and American youths march down the streets singing songs in his honor. Whipple speaks out against aliens and calling for a rejection of ‚Äúsophistication, Marxism and International Capitalism.‚Äù West, Nathanael. Novels & Other Writings. Ed. Sacvan Bercovitch. New York: The Library of America, 1997. 238. The novel ends with a series of roaring \\"hails\\" from the crowd. Literary significance and criticism Pitkin's pathetic inability to conform to society‚Äôs standards, or to the ‚ÄòAmerican‚Äô way of life, is the main cause of his repeated failures. Nevertheless, there is something admirable in Pitkin‚Äôs na√Øve persistence, as West wrote in a letter to S. J. Perelman: :Suppose he had the Horatio Alger slant and was a guy who was trying to get one foot on the ladder of success and they were always moving the ladder on him, but they couldn‚Äôt touch the dream.quoted in Martin, Jay. Nathanael West: The Art of His Life. New York: Hayden, 1971. xxi. West not only parodies Alger by mimicking his prose style, he also lifted several passages directly from a number of different Alger novels.Scharnhorst, Gary. \\"From Rags To Patches, or A Cool Million As Alter- Alger.\\" Ball State University Forum 21 (1980): 58-65. In A Cool Million, West presents Italian slavers, Chinese pimps, brutal Irish cops, and greedy Jewish lawyers. Though most of the early criticism dismissed the novel as too direct a parody to have any real literary merit, it is seen by some as an early example of postmodernism. Harold Bloom includes A Cool Million in his list of canonical works of the period he names the Chaotic Age (1900‚Äìpresent) in The Western Canon.Bloom, Harold. The Western Canon New York: Harcourt Brace & Co, 1994. 532. Bloom also deems the rhetoric used by Shagpoke Whipple as prophetic of such presidents as Ronald Reagan.Bloom, Harold. Introduction. American fiction, 1914-1945. New York: Chelsea House, 1987. 22-23. Publication history West began writing A Cool Million in the fall of 1933. A handwritten first draft was completed in November. Though Harcourt, Brace rejected the novel, West continued to work on it until it was finally accepted by Covici- Friede in March 1934. The novel was published in New York City in an edition of 3,000 copies to mixed reviews and poor sales; it was not reprinted in West's lifetime. The novel later appeared in several reprints starting from 1940, following West's renewed fame, and was collected in a single volume edition of the complete novels, as well as in the Library of America edition of West's collected works.West, Nathanael. Novels & Other Writings. Ed. Sacvan Bercovitch. New York: The Library of America, 1997. 814. A Cool Million - a screen story In September 1940 West wrote an original screen story in collaboration with Boris Ingster. They used A Cool Million as their title, though the story had nothing to do with the novel, hoping that a studio would pay more for a story allegedly based on a published book. West was certain that no one would actually read the book to check whether the screen story had any relation to the novel. On September 24, 1940 Columbia Pictures bought the story for $10,000 and assigned it to screenwriter Sidney Buchman. However, the studio soon abandoned the project and A Cool Million was never filmed. The text of the screen story appears in the Library of America's edition of West's work.

Balsam of Peru, also known and marketed by many other names, is a balsam derived from a tree known as Myroxylon balsamum var. pereirae; it is found in El Salvador, where it is an endemic species. Balsam of Peru is used in food and drink for flavoring, in perfumes and toiletries for fragrance, and in medicine and pharmaceutical items for healing properties. It has a sweet scent. In some instances, balsam of Peru is listed on the ingredient label of a product by one of its various names, but it may not be required to be listed by its name by mandatory labeling conventions. It can cause allergic reactions, with numerous large surveys identifying it as being in the \\"top five\\" allergens most commonly causing patch test reactions. It may cause inflammation, redness, swelling, soreness, itching, and blisters, including allergic contact dermatitis, stomatitis (inflammation and soreness of the mouth or tongue), cheilitis (inflammation, rash, or painful erosion of the lips, oropharyngeal mucosa, or angles of the mouth), pruritus, hand eczema, generalized or resistant plantar dermatitis, rhinitis, and conjunctivitis.  Collection  Balsam of Peru is an aromatic viscous resin obtained by scorching or inflicting V-shaped wounds on the bark of the trunk of the tree Myroxylon balsamum var. pereirae. In response, the balsam of Peru ‚Äì oily, resin-like, aromatic fluid ‚Äì exudes to heal the tree's lesions, and the liquid is collected. An essential oil is distilled from the balsam. Composition Balsam of Peru contains 25 or so different substances, including cinnamein, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl cinnamate, benzyl benzoate, benzoic acid, and vanillin. It also contains cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamaldehyde, farnesol, and nerolidol. A minority of it, approximately 30‚Äì40%, contains resins or esters of unknown composition. Uses Balsam of Peru is used in food and drink for flavoring, in perfumes and toiletries for fragrance, and in medicine and pharmaceutical items for healing properties. In some cases, it is listed on the ingredient label of a product by one of its various names. Naturally occurring ingredients may contain substances identical to or very closely related to balsam of Peru. It has four primary uses: *flavoring in foods and drinks such as coffee, flavored tea, wine, beer, gin, liqueurs, ap√©ritifs (e.g., vermouth, bitters), soft drinks including cola, juice, citrus, citrus fruit peel, marmalade, tomatoes and tomato-containing products, Mexican and Italian foods with red sauces, ketchup, spices (e.g., cloves, Jamaica pepper (allspice), cinnamon, nutmeg, paprika, curry, anise, and ginger), chili sauce, barbecue sauce, chutney, pickles, pickled vegetables, chocolate, vanilla, baked goods and pastries, pudding, ice cream, chewing gum, and candy *fragrance in perfumes and toiletries, such as perfumes, colognes, deodorants, soaps, shampoos, conditioners, after-shave lotions, cosmetics, lipsticks, creams, lotions, ointments, baby powders, sunscreens, and suntan lotions *in medicinal products such as hemorrhoid suppositories and ointment, cough medicine/suppressant and lozenges, diaper rash ointments, oral and lip ointments, tincture of benzoin, wound spray (it has been reported to inhibit Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as the common ulcer-causing bacteria H. pylori in test-tube studies), calamine lotion, surgical dressings, dental cement, eugenol used by dentists, some periodontal impression materials, and in the treatment of dry socket in dentistry. *optical properties as a glue, typically as a mounting medium for microscope specimens\\"Peru balsam\\", Sigma-Aldrich catalog. Accessed: December 15, 2014 due to purified balsam of Peru's transparency and refractive index of 1.597 being very close to that of many glasses used in optics It also can be found in toothpaste, mouthwash, scented tobacco, cleaning products, pesticides, insect repellants, air fresheners and deodorizers, scented candles, and oil paint. Allergy A number of national and international surveys have identified balsam of Peru as being in the \\"top five\\" allergens most commonly causing patch test reactions in people referred to dermatology clinics. A study in 2001 found that 3.8% of the general population patch tested was allergic to it. Many flavorings and perfumes contain components identical to balsam of Peru. It may cause redness, swelling, itching, and blisters. People allergic to balsam of Peru or other chemically related substances may experience a contact dermatitis reaction. If they have oral exposure, they may experience stomatitis (inflammation and soreness of the mouth or tongue), and cheilitis (inflammation, rash, or painful erosion of the lips, oropharyngeal mucosa, or angles of their mouth). If they ingest it, they may experience pruritus and contact dermatitis in the perianal region, possibly due to unabsorbed substances in the feces. It can cause a flare-up of hand eczema. Among the other allergic reactions to balsam of Peru are generalized or resistant plantar dermatitis, rhinitis, and conjunctivitis, In a case study in Switzerland, a woman who was allergic to balsam of Peru was allergic to her boyfriend's semen following intercourse after he drank large amounts of Coca-Cola. Patch test Positive result A positive patch test is used to diagnose an allergy to balsam of Peru. Positive patch test results indicate that the person may have problems with certain flavorings, medications, and perfumed products. Among foods, the most commonly implicated are spices, citrus, and tomatoes. People allergic to balsam of Peru may benefit from a diet in which they avoid ingesting foods that contain it. Naturally occurring ingredients may contain substances identical to or very closely related to balsam of Peru, and may cause the same allergic reactions. In some instances, balsam of Peru is listed on the ingredient label of a product by one of its various names, but it may not be required to be listed by its name by mandatory labeling conventions (in fragrances, for example, it may simply be covered by an ingredient listing of \\"fragrance\\"). To determine if balsam of Peru is in a product, often doctors have to contact the manufacturer of the products used by the patient. Before 1977, the main recommended marker for perfume allergy was balsam of Peru, which is still advised. The presence of balsam of Peru in a cosmetic will be denoted by the INCI term Myroxylon pereirae. Because of allergic reactions, since 1982 crude balsam of Peru has been banned by the International Fragrance Association from use as a fragrance compound, but extracts and distillates are used up to a maximum level of 0.4% in products, and are not covered by mandatory labeling. In March 2006, the European Commission, Health and Consumer Protection Directorate-General, Scientific Committee on Consumer Products, issued an opinion on balsam of Peru. It confirmed that crude balsam of Peru should not be used as a fragrance ingredient, because of a wide variety of test results on its sensitizing potential, but that extracts and distillates can be used up to a maximum level of 0.4% in products. History The name balsam of Peru is a misnomer. In the early period of Spanish invasion in Central and South America, the balsam was collected in Central America and shipped to Callao and Lima in Peru, then shipped onward to Europe. It acquired the name of \\"Peru\\" because it was shipped from there. Its export to Europe was first documented in the seventeenth century in the German pharmacopedia. Today it is extracted under a handicraft process, and is mainly exported from El Salvador. The two balsams obtained from Myroxylon species trees, balsam of Peru and tolu balsam (not balsam of tol√∫). are produced in different ways (see Myroxylon). \\"Tolu balsam\\" is not a misnomer but rather a toponymy since the balsam was actually obtained from the latex of a tree originally described by Carl Linnaeus as Toluifera balsamum later known as Myroxylon balsamum. In 1753 Linnaeus described the type specimen of Toluifera balsamum using a specimen collected in the province of Cartagena, probably a town called Tol√∫, which at the time was located in the province of Cartagena, and named it Toluifera balsamum in relation to the place of collection. In ecological terms, Tol√∫ region can be described, according to Holdridge classification as tropical dry forest, which is home to Myroxylon sp. trees. Alternate names Among the alternate names used for balsam of Peru are: balsamum peruvianim, black balsam, China oil, Honduras balsam, Indian balsam, Peruvian balsam, Peru balsam, Surinam balsam, balsams Peru, balsam Peru oil, oil balsam Peru, Peru balsam oil, balsamum peruvianum, b√°lsamo del Per√∫, baume du P√©rou, baume P√©ruvien, baume de San Salvador, Myroxylon pereirae klotzsch resin, Myroxylon balsamum var. pereirae, Myroxylon pereirae klotzsch oil, Myrospermum pereirae, Myrosperum pereira balsam, balsam fir oleoresin, balsam fir oil, hyperabsolute balsam, quina, balsamo, tolu, quina quina, Santos mahogany, Toluifera pereirae, and Toluifera pereira balsam.

ARCHELON, the Sea Turtle Protection Society of Greece was founded in 1983. It aims to protect sea turtles and their habitats in Greece through research, public awareness campaigns, restoring habitats, and through its rescue centre, built in 1994. Overview ARCHELON is a partner to the UNEP Mediterranean Action Plan, and is hosting the 2006 International Sea Turtle Conference. Despite working with major national and international bodies, ARCHELON relies heavily on the work of volunteers, of which there are some 400 each year. They state that due to their work: *Every year over 2,500 nests are protected against human threats, predation and sea inundation. *Nearly 4,000 turtles have been tagged in order to monitor their movements in the sea. Recently satellite transmitters have been used. *Over 50 injured or sick turtles are treated every year at the Rescue Centre at Glyfada (Athens). *Three permanent and 10 seasonal stations are operated by ARCHELON on Zakynthos, Peloponnesus and Crete. *About 200,000 tourists are directly contacted through ARCHELON's diverse programmes every year *Over 13,000 students participate every year in the educational programmes The rescue centre is currently undergoing development and expansion, and an emergency turtle first-aid centre was built in 2005, on Crete. In 2004, as Athens hosted the Olympic games resulted in a tight financial situation for Greece nationally, which resulted in cuts in its environmental services, which included the closure of the National Marine Park of Zakynthos, a move strongly contested by ARCHELON and its members, who prepared a petition.  Field projects  ARCHELON run a total of 7 long term field projects on loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), nesting beaches around Greece. These projects run for the majority of the nesting and hatching season, from mid-May until mid-October.  Zakynthos Project  The Ionian island of Zakynthos (western Greece) has the largest Mediterranean nesting (the second one being in Kyparissia bay). Because of this, Zakynthos has been chosen to host the original project. The group's founders, Dimitris and Anna Margaritoulis, began collecting data here in the late 1970s and from those initial studies the group grew. Today the project continues to be the largest in scope of all the Archelon projects. There are 6 beaches on the island that are monitored by the group, all of which are in Laganas Bay to the South. These beaches are Gerakas, Daphni, Sekania, Kalamaki (Crystal beach), Laganas and Marathonissi, a small uninhabited island in the bay. All of the beaches apart from Sekania are heavily used by tourists. Sekania is specially protected due to its very high density of nests and, therefore, its importance as a nesting area. It is completely closed to visitors. The protection of all the beaches and the waters in the bay are implemented by the National Marine Park of Zakynthos. The land behind Sekania was bought by the WWF in order to prevent construction of any kind which may disturb the turtles nesting behaviour. In 2014 the group has reported a nest count of 1066 nests on the 6 beaches. In addition its public awareness activities have informed approximately 63,600 people, mostly tourists.

The area includes areas to the west of Philadelphia, along with the cities of Allentown, Bethlehem, and Reading. It includes much of the Delaware Valley, including almost all of Delaware County and most of the Philadelphia Main Line. History Area code 610 was created on January 8, 1994 as a split from numbering plan area 215, which had been the entire southeast quadrant of Pennsylvania since 1947. Permissive dialing of both 215 and 610 continued until the morning of January 7, 1995.Bellcore Letter Number IL-93/01-001 It was Pennsylvania's first new area code since the implementation of the area code system in 1947. Three exchanges which would have switched to 610 were instead switched to 717, the area code for most of the eastern half of the state outside of the lower Delaware and Lehigh Valleys. They were 267 at Denver, 445 at Terre Hill, and 484 at Adamstown, with 267 being replaced with 717-336 because 717-267 was already in use at Chambersburg. These exchanges were all served by non-Bell telephone companies which sought to consolidate their eastern Pennsylvania customers into one area code, and would have had to change area codes anyway. This was intended as a long-term solution, but further growth in the region over the subsequent five years, and the proliferation of cell phones and pagers, spurred the introduction of area code 484 as an overlay for the 610 region on June 5, 1999, along with the introduction of mandatory ten-digit dialing.\\"Area Codes in Southeast Pennsylvania\\", Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission Area code 835 was intended as an additional overlay code for the 610 and 484 numbering plan area, as announced by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission in May 2000 and to be implemented in 2001. However, newly developed, more efficient number pooling measures were introduced instead, eliminating the immediate need for the new area code. The Commission formally withdrew plans for the new code on June 23, 2005, although the code remains reserved for later use within the Commonwealth if necessary.\\"PUC withdraws 835 overlay in 610/484 area codes\\", Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, June 23, 2005 Under the most recent projections, the region will need another area code by the summer of 2024.April 2020 NANP exhaust analysis Area code 610 was the last area code assigned with a \\"1\\" (one) for its middle digit. When area codes were introduced in 1947, all numbers followed the pattern N0X or N1X (where the middle digit was either a zero or one). By 1994, area code 610 was the last remaining number in this group. The next new area codes after 610 to be assigned (334 in Alabama and 360 in Washington, both in 1995) were the first to have numbers other than 0 or 1 for their middle digits.

Prior usage for TWX Most of the N10 area codes (510, 710, 810, and 910) were used prior to 1981 by AT&T; for their TWX, or Teletypewriter Exchange Service (TWX) network. Telex use of these area codes in the United States was decommissioned in 1981 when Western Union, who had acquired the TWX network in 1969 from AT&T;, and renamed it Telex II, upgraded the network to \\"4-row\\" ASCII operation. Area code 510 was reassigned to Oakland, California in 1991, 710 went to the US federal government in 1983, 810 and 910 were assigned to Michigan and North Carolina, respectively in 1993. The last TWX code, 610, outlived the others because it was controlled by Bell Canada, and not directly affected by AT&T;'s exit from teletype services. Area code 610 was replaced with non-geographic Canadian area code 600 in 1992, freeing the area code for reassignment to general telecommunication services. When it was reassigned in 1994, area code 610 was the last geographic area code assigned to follow the original pattern of having the digits 1 or 0 in the middle position. In 1995, the assignment of interchangeable NPA codes commenced, which broke the pattern.

If spending is greater than disposable income, dissaving is taking place. This spending is financed by already accumulated savings, such as money in a savings account, or it can be borrowed. Dissaving was reported as a typical response to deficits, for households with normal income and expenditure patterns during the depression of the 1930s. The life- cycle hypothesis of saving, of Ando and Modigliani, proposes that people work and save when they are young and retire and dissave when they become elderly. Hayashi, Ando, and Ferris investigated whether the elderly save or dissave and found for the United States that families after retirement dissave on average about a third of their peak wealth by the time of death, leaving the rest (mostly their homes) as bequests. In contrast they found that for Japan the elderly forming independent households and those living with children continue to save, for all but the most elderly. From age 80 or more and, also the single elderly of all ages, the dissaving patterns were evident. Later evidence presented by Horioka reinforces the life cycle hypothesis in Japan.

Its anchors are Macy's, Sears, Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue, and it features more than 160 specialty shops and restaurants. History The Gardens Mall, originally called The Gardens of The Palm Beaches, was developed by The Forbes Company, based in Southfield, Michigan. On October 5, 1988, the mall opened with three initial anchor stores: Burdines, Sears and the second Macy's in Florida. Bloomingdales and Saks Fifth Avenue joined as tenants in 1990. Burdines was shuttered in 2003 as Federated Department Stores (now Macy's, Inc.), the owners of the Macy's chain, consolidated all its nameplates into the Macy's brand, which already had a location at the mall. In March 2006, Nordstrom opened on the former Burdines site instead. In 2005, the Florida Department of Transportation completed a new interchange at PGA Boulevard (SR 786) and SR 811, providing direct access from the mall entrance to I-95. In December 2005, former baseball all-star Jeff Reardon was taken into custody and charged by the Palm Beach Gardens, Florida Police Department for allegedly committing armed robbery at the former Hamilton Jewelers store. In October 2007, the mall underwent minor renovations as the fountain in the center was altered and the center court's garden theme was replaced with a more modern look.

Signs and symptoms Traumatic asphyxia is characterized by cyanosis in the upper extremities, neck, and head as well as petechiae in the conjunctiva. Patients can also display jugular venous distention and facial edema. Associated injuries include pulmonary contusion, myocardial contusion, hemo/pneumothorax, and broken ribs. Causes Traumatic asphyxia occurs when a powerful compressive force is applied to the thoracic cavity. This is most often seen in motor vehicle accidents, as well as industrial and farming accidents. However, it can be present anytime a significant pressure is applied to the thorax. Pathophysiology The sudden impact on the thorax causes an increase in intrathoracic pressure. In order for traumatic asphyxia to occur, a Valsalva maneuver is required when the traumatic force is applied. Exhalation against the closed glottis along with the traumatic event causes air that cannot escape from the thoracic cavity. Instead, the air causes increased venous back-pressure, which is transferred back to the heart through the right atrium, to the superior vena cava and to the head and neck veins and capillaries. Diagnosis Patients are seen with a cyanotic discoloration of the shoulder skin and neck and face, jugular distention, bulging of the eyeballs, and swelling of the tongue and lips. The latter two are resultants of edema, caused by excessive blood accumulating the veins of the head and neck and venous stasis.

Kudara was an uji or clan name that represented their country of origin, Baekje. Konikishi or Kokishi, which literally means \\"king\\", was a special kabane that was given only to the former royal families of Baekje and Goguryeo: the Kudara, Sh≈çna (ËÇñÂ•à) and Koma (È´òÈ∫ó) clans. The founder Zenk≈ç came from Baekje to Japan as a hostage along with his brother H≈çsh≈ç in 643. Even though Japan sent H≈çsh≈ç back to Korea for a failed campaign to revive Baekje, Zenk≈ç remained in Japan. The former royal family members were treated as \\"barbarian guests\\" (ËïÉÂÆ¢) and were not incorporated into the domestic political system of Japan for some time. They enjoyed privileged treatment while they were obliged to serve to the emperor in a symbolic fashion. They were finally assimilated into Japanese bureaucracy in 691. They were given the name \\"Kudara no Konikishi\\" sometime after that. This event has drawn scholarly attention and a couple of theories have been proposed to explain the reason why they were given this peculiar name at that particular time. One theory associates the event with the enforcement of the Asuka Kiyomihara Code in 689: the law system entailed clarification of their legal status. However, while being subjects to the Japanese emperor, they still needed to represent Baekje kingship by the special name. Japan applied to herself the Chinese ideology of emperorship that required \\"barbarian people\\" to long for the great virtue of the emperor. In 790, Emperor Kanmu issued a rescript that treats the Kudara no Konikishi clan as \\"relatives by marriage\\". It was related to the fact that the emperor's mother Takano no Niigasa belonged to the Baekje-originated Yamato no Fuhito clan, who at that time claimed its root in the Baekje royal family. Another theory attempts to interpret the rise and fall of the Kudara no Konikishi clan in the context of domestic politics rather than political ideology: This clan fell under the influence of the southern branch of the Fujiwara clan after Kudara no Konikishi My≈çshin married Fujiwara no Tsugutada around 754. The emperor's rescript of 790 aimed to support My≈çshin's appointment as Lady in Waiting (Â∞ö‰æç), the highest post among court ladies, despite her humble origin. She helped the clan's other female members enter the imperial court. Their prosperous days ended in 807 when Fujiwara no Takatoshi, the son of Tsugutada and My≈çshin, fell from power in an imperial succession dispute. They declined from the latter half of the 9th century to the early 10th century and disappeared from the political scene. Notable members of the Kudara no Konikishi clan include: *Kudara no Konikishi Zenk≈ç () (617-700) - The founder of the clan *Kudara no Konikishi Sh≈çsei () (?-674) - son of the founder *Kudara no Konikishi R≈çgu () (661-737) - Vice Governor of Settsu () *Kudara no Konikishi Ky≈çfuku () (697-766) - Lord of Justice () *Kudara no Konikishi Shuntetsu () (740-795) - General of Peace Guard for Mutsu and Vice Delegate of Conquering East-Barbarian () *Kudara no Konikishi Buky≈ç () - Governor of Dewa () Notes External links * Kudara no Konishiki Genealogy Tree (ÁôæÊ∏àÊ∞èÁ•ñÁ≥ª) Warning: This page contains pieces of family trees which are not considered historical facts by historians.

History The Asashio-class destroyers were larger and more capable that the preceding , as Japanese naval architects were no longer constrained by the provisions of the London Naval Treaty. These light cruiser-sized vessels were designed to take advantage of Japan's lead in torpedo technology, and to accompany the Japanese main striking force and in both day and night attacks against the United States Navy as it advanced across the Pacific Ocean, according to Japanese naval strategic projections.Peattie & Evans, Kaigun .

Operational history At 1800 hours on 23 June 1941, Minegumo collided with the destroyers and in Bungo Channel. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Minegumo, under the command of Lieutenant Commander Suzuki Yasuatsu, was assigned to Destroyer Division 8 (Desdiv 8), and a member of Destroyer Squadron 4 (Desron 4) of the IJN 2nd Fleet, escorting Admiral Nobutake Kond≈ç's Southern Force Main Body out of Mako Guard District as distant cover to the Malaya and Philippines invasion forces in December 1941. In early 1942, she escorted troop convoys to Lingayen, Tarakan, Balikpapan and Makassar in the Netherlands East Indies. During the Battle of the Java Sea, she engaged in an exchange of gunnery with the British destroyer , and suffered light damage with four crewmen wounded. On 1 March, together with , Minegumo unsuccessfully attacked the American submarine with depth charges. After participation in the Battle of Christmas Island on 31 March ‚Äì 10 April, she escorted the damaged cruiser to Singapore, and returned at the end of the month to the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal for repairs. At the end of May, Minegumo joined the escort for the Midway Invasion Force under the overall command of Admiral Kondo Nobutake during the Battle of Midway. In July, she was sent to northern waters, patrolling from Ominato Guard District towards the Kurile Islands. Afterwards, she was sent south to Truk, where she suffered minor damage on a coral reef on 20 August. She provided support in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in August 1942, and escorted the damaged aircraft carrier back to Truk. From September, she was assigned to patrols from Truk towards Shortland, and in October was assigned to \\"Tokyo Express\\" high speed transport operations in the Solomon Islands. On one of these missions on 5 October, she suffered moderate damage in an air attack, with serious flooding off Guadalcanal. She limped back to Yokosuka for repairs by the end of November. Repairs completed by 22 February 1943, Minegumo returned with a convoy to Truk. She continued on to Rabaul by 2 March. During another transport run from Rabaul to Kolombangara on 5 March Minegumo and are believed to have sunk the submarine . However, that same night, Murasame and Minegumo were detected by the American Task Force 68 off Vila, after delivering supplies to the Japanese base there.
