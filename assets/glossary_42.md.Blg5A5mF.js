Lowndes Johnson as a one-design racer and first built in 1932. The design has evolved over time via modifications.Sherwood, Richard M.: A Field Guide to Sailboats of North America, Second Edition, pages 66-67. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. The design was intended as a smaller version of the Star keelboat, making it easier to transport. Production The design was first shown in an article in Yachting in 1932 and was initially built from wood by the Skaneateles Boat & Canoe Co.. Later builders included the Lippincott Boat Works, Customflex and Siddons & Sindle. The current builder is Whitecap Composites of Peabody, Massachusetts, United States. It remains in production, with more than 4,100 boats completed in total. Plans for the design remain available for amateur construction. Design The Comet is a recreational planing sailboat, built predominantly of wood or fiberglass. It has a fractional sloop rig with aluminum spars, running backstays and an optional headstay. The hull features hard chines, a spooned raked stem, an angled transom, a rounded, transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller and a retractable, drum-controlled, metal centerboard. The boat displaces . The Comet has a draft of with the centerboard extended and with it retracted, allowing beaching or ground transportation on a trailer. To keep it up to date, the class association has allowed modifications to the design over the years, including the addition of self-bailers, a full width mainsheet traveler, windows in the mainsail and jib for visibility and buoyancy tanks to make the boat unsinkable. The boat has a boom vang and adjustable backstays. It has two different rigging options, one with three stays supporting the mast and an alternate rig with a jumper and seven stays. Current factory options include a ball-bearing mainsheet traveler, mast rake controls and leading of all lines to the cockpit for control while hiking. The design has a Portsmouth Yardstick racing average handicap of 92.0 and is normally raced with a crew of two sailors. Operational history The design is supported by an active class club, the Comet Class Association. The association has 14 fleets in the eastern US, plus one in Bermuda. In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, \\"an older design, the Comet has many modern features. The bottom is flat and the afterbody is broad. She planes. The Comet is a one-design with rigid controls on size, shape, and materials. Minor modifications through the years have kept her up-to-date.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Related development *Star (keelboat) References External links * Category:Dinghies Category:1930s sailboat type designs Category:Two-person sailboats ","title":"Comet (dinghy)"},{"id":"2448476","text":"Broomfield may refer to: People * Broomfield (surname) Places In New Zealand: * Broomfield, New Zealand In the United Kingdom: *Broomfield, Aberdeenshire * Broomfield, Cumbria *Broomfield, Essex *Broomfield, Herne Bay, Kent *Broomfield, Maidstone, Kent *Broomfield, Somerset *Broomfield, Wiltshire *Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford, Essex *Broomfield House, Enfield, North London, and the surrounding Broomfield Park *Broomfield School (Arnos Grove), Enfield, North London In the United States: * Broomfield, Colorado * Broomfield Township, Michigan * Broomfield Rowhouse in Omaha, Nebraska Sports venues * New Broomfield, Airdrie, Scotland * Broomfield Park, Airdrie, Scotland See also *Bloomfield (disambiguation) *Bromfield (disambiguation) *Brumfield ja:„Éñ„É´„Éº„É†„Éï„Ç£„Éº„É´„Éâ ","title":"Broomfield"},{"id":"2448477","title":"Tommi Evil√§"},{"id":"2448493","text":"Interstate Battery System of America, Inc., a.k.a. Interstate Batteries, is a privately owned battery marketing and distribution company. It markets automotive batteries manufactured by Brookfield Business Partners, Exide Technologies, and others through independent distributors. The company is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and it also markets marine/RV, mobility, motorcycle, lawn and garden, and other lines of batteries in the starting, lighting and ignition (SLI) markets. Interstate Batteries operates a distributor network that supplies batteries to over 200,000 dealers. They also have distributors in Bermuda, Bolivia, Canada, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama, with more international distributors planned. Additionally, they operate over 200 corporate and franchise owned retail stores. Interstate plans to expand worldwide locations in coming years as part of a company-wide growth and development initiative. History In the spring of 1950, John Searcy began selling and delivering car batteries to wholesalers in the Dallas/Fort Worth area from the back of his red Studebaker pickup truck. After two years, Searcy founded his new company, naming it Interstate Battery System after the new interstate highway system being built across the U.S.Interstate History In 1978, John Searcy retired and left the company under the leadership of President and Chairman Norm Miller. Norm Miller continued the company‚Äôs expansion so that by the 1980s Interstate Battery had distributorships in all 50 states and Canada. During that time they also created the Interstate Batteries Great American Race, which for 13 years took vintage car owners and their vehicles on a two-week, cross-country rally. This opened the door to other marketing opportunities such as advertising on the Paul Harvey news radio show, running national TV commercials, and sponsoring champion fishermen Guido and Dion Hibdon. In 1990, Norm's brother Tommy Miller became Interstate Battery's President and CEO while Norm remained Chairman of the Board. As a result, Interstate Battery became heavily involved in NASCAR, America's fastest-growing professional sport. Interstate Battery became title sponsor of coach Joe Gibbs' new Winston Cup team in 1992 which eventually won the prestigious Winston Cup Championship in 2000. In March 2004, Carlos Sepulveda became President & CEO and went on to lead the company for almost a decade until leaving in 2013 to join Triumph Bancorp Group. Norm Miller's son Scott became President and CEO in 2013. Motorsports Interstate Batteries currently sponsors NASCAR driver Kyle Busch and the Joe Gibbs Racing team. Other notable drivers that have run the company's sponsors have been Bobby Labonte, Dale Jarrett, Matt Kenseth, and J. J. Yeley. In 2010, the company began sponsoring NHRA Pro Stock driver Mike Edwards.  Events  Interstate Batteries holds bi-annual conventions in various settings including most recently Long Beach, California in 2018. Executives, vendors, and other special guests inform employees and distributors about company progress, sales, and growth through multiple sessions. Entry to these events is available to current employees, distributorships, and their families. Noteworthy guests include stars like Chuck Norris with special performances by groups such as Newsboys among others.

(c. 1010 - August 1057), surnamed Abagelard, was the Count of Apulia and Calabria from 1051 to his death. Life Humphrey was probably the youngest son of Tancred of Hauteville by his first wife Muriel. Some sources make Geoffrey and Serlo his younger brothers. He is usually said to have accompanied his elder brothers William and Drogo to the Mezzogiorno circa 1035 on the basis of Goffredo Malaterra; however, he may have arrived later, in 1044, during the reign of his elder brother William. Around 1047, he was granted the lordship (or countship) of Lavello by his brother Drogo, whom he succeeded as Count of Apulia in August 1051. In his early years in Lavello, he employed a young Richard Drengot, who was later to serve him against the pope. In 1053, Humphrey received his three brothers, Geoffrey and their half- brothers Mauger and a younger William, on their arrival in Italy. He granted Mauger the Capitanate and William the Principate. His reign began amid the troubles which had ended his brother's. Humphrey vigorously punished the instigators of his brother's assassination, especially the principal murderer. Many Norman knights were in rebellion and pillaging papal lands. Guaimar IV of Salerno supported Humphrey's succession, but he was soon assassinated. Pope Leo IX organised a coalition against the Normans and marched south. The pope's forces and those of the Normans fought the Battle of Civitate near Civitate sul Fortore on 18 June 1053. Humphrey led the armies of the Hautevilles (assisted by his younger half-brother Robert Guiscard) and Drengots (assisted by Richard Drengot) against the combined forces of the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire. The Normans destroyed the papal army and captured the pope, whom they imprisoned in Benevento, which they had been authorised by the emperor to capture in 1047. They finally released him on 12 March 1054. Leo died soon after. Abbey of the Santissima Trinit√†, Venosa In the aftermath of Civitate, the Normans under Humphrey took advantage of the severely weakened papacy to further their conquest. He took Oria, Nard√≤, and Lecce by the end of 1055. Robert Guiscard, the hero of Civitate, meanwhile conquered Minervino Murge, Otranto, and Gallipoli, Apulia before Humphrey sent him back to Calabria in fear of his growing power and influence. Upon his death in 1057 (or 1056 according to some sources), Humphrey was succeeded as count by Robert. Humphrey had given Guiscard the guardianship of his young sons, but Guiscard confiscated their inheritance. Humphrey is buried in the Abbey of the Santissima Trinit√† in Venosa. Relatives Humphrey's wife was called a \\"sister of the Duke of Sorrento\\" by Amatus of Montecassino. This would make her Gaitelgrima, a daughter of Guaimar III of Salerno. It is often stated that his wife was Gaitelgrima, the widow of his brother Drogo, however this is impossible.In an act dated January 1087, Gaitelgrima refers to her husbands as Drogo, Robert, and Affred - Humphrey had two children: *Abagelard, born after 1044 and died in Greece in 1081 *Herman, born after 1045 and died in Byzantium in 1097 We know that Humphrey also had at least one daughter because of a story told by Amatus. Abelard was fleeing Robert Guiscard with \\"Gradilon, the husband of his sister\\" in 1078 when in revolt against his uncle. Gradilon was captured by the Guiscard's troops near Trevico in the summer of 1079 and blinded. Notes Sources *Ghisalberti, Albert (ed). Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani: II Albicante - Ammannati.

It is commonly and idiomatically known by various terms‚Äîmost often as dip or chew. It is used by placing a pinch, or \\"dip\\" of tobacco between the lip and the gum (sublabial administration). The act of using it is called dipping or sometimes chewing. Dip is colloquially called \\"chaw\\", \\"snuff\\", \\"rub\\", or \\"fresh leaf\\" among other terms; because of this, it is sometimes confused with other tobacco products‚Äînamely nasal/dry snuff. Typically, before dipping, the act of \\"packing\\" is performed, where the user places the \\"can\\" in between the thumb and middle finger, then flicks the index finger onto the lid of the can.  History  Dipping tobacco evolved from the use of dry snuff in early American history. Up until the late 1700s, dry snuff was taken nasally, but then early Americans would take snuff orally by chewing the end of a twig until it resembled a brush, and then \\"dipping\\" the twig in the snuff and placing it in their mouths until the snuff dissolved. Using dry snuff orally eventually evolved into modern day moist snuff, with Copenhagen introduced in 1822, and Skoal introduced in 1934. Most varieties of dipping tobacco are much more recent inventions. Today, moist snuff is available throughout the United States. However, it is typically more popular in rural areas and the South than in large cities. Dipping tobacco is predominantly used by males. Also, dipping tobacco has a similar presence in Canada. Smokeless tobacco use by professional baseball players was widespread throughout the 20th century until more recent years with the MLB cracking down on tobacco consumption, although a 1999 survey reported that \\"31 percent of the league's rookies used smokeless tobacco\\". According to recent reports from NFL players, many professional football players chew tobacco in locker rooms, with some teams reporting that up to 75% of players admit to dipping.  Description  Four different cans (or tins) of dipping tobacco (from bottom left, clockwise): Skoal straight, Skoal long cut mint, Copenhagen straight, and Copenhagen long cut. A can of Copenhagen brand American dipping tobacco. Dipping tobacco is packaged in \\"tins\\" or \\"cans\\", although they are not typically completely metal any more. Dipping tobacco is also available in \\"rolls\\", \\"logs\\", or \\"sleeves\\", which is a package of 5 tins of tobacco, a similar concept to that of a carton of cigarettes. Ten tin rolls were also available in the past. Another package of dipping tobacco is the \\"tub\\", available in only select brands, equivalent to 6, 10, or 12 cans. Before opening the can/tin of tobacco, users typically \\"pack\\" the can, similar to how cigarette smokers pack a pack of cigarettes. This is done by placing one's thumb and middle finger on the sides of the can, and then quickly turning the can and flicking the wrist so that one's index finger taps the top of the can. Unlike snus, which is most often placed between the upper lip and gum, moist tobacco users or \\"dippers\\" tend to use the lower. Dipping in the upper lip is unusual, though when done, it is colloquially termed an \\"upper decker\\" or \\"top lip dip\\". The dip rests on the inside lining of the mouth for a period depending upon the user's preference‚Äîoften 20‚Äì40 minutes. Nicotine and other alkaloids found in tobacco are absorbed in saliva sublabially by the inferior or superior labial arteries. Buccal and sublingual absorption may also occur. Also unlike snus, dip often causes the user to produce excess saliva during the act of dipping. This is typically spit onto the ground or in a container, because swallowing the saliva-tobacco mixture can cause irritation to the esophagus and induce nausea and vomiting. A spittoon can be used, but often users will simply use an empty plastic bottle or a \\"mudjug,\\" a portable spittoon. Smokeless tobacco is sometimes used in the workplace by employees, especially if the employer does not provide many cigarette breaks or if the employee is consistently using both hands during work (which doesn't provide opportunities for cigarette smoking). Smokeless tobacco is popular in many industrial areas where there is a safety risk in having an open flame, such as oil rigs or refineries.  Etymology and terminology  An example of how dipping tobacco is often placed in the mouth. Dipping tobacco was first popularized and marketed as moist snuff in the 1800s. The term \\"snuff\\" in this context is an English cognate of the aforementioned \\"snus\\", from Swedish. Dipping tobacco's Scandinavian roots impart a noticeable legacy on modern American brands such as Copenhagen and Skoal (referring to the interlinguistic term sk√•l, which in Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic, Faroese and Swedish roughly translates to \\"cheers\\", implying a toast). A user of dipping tobacco will produce an excess amount of saliva which will be disposed of using a \\"spitter.\\" A spitter can be an empty bottle, cup or commercially produced spittoon. Dipping tobacco use is often accompanied by first drinking a liquid, in some areas known as a primer, catalyst, and rinser. A primer is used to initially salivate the mouth, usually during a meal, in order to prepare the mouth to use smokeless tobacco. This is important because a dry mouth or one full of food could lead to a less enjoyable experience for the user. A catalyst, like a primer, is used to fix the issues of a dry mouth or dry tobacco, however, the dipping tobacco is already currently in the user's lip. A rinser is used when the user is finished with their tobacco, and it is swished around in the user's mouth, similar to mouthwash, to dispose of any excess tobacco juice or particulates. All three liquids are usually water, but any liquid may be used. Primarily in Texas and other southern US states, terminology is unique. Dip or dips refers to a wad of tobacco, whereas snuff refers to any amount of tobacco greater than a dip. For example, a tobacco user may reach for a dip from of snuff. Many areas have no such distinction, and may rarely use the word \\"snuff\\".  Cut sizes  The difference between cut sizes is the length of the strands of dip. =Common cut sizes= *Extra Long cuts are a little longer than long cut. *Wide cuts are long cut, just a little wider. *Long cuts are the most widely available cut size. *Fine cuts/snuffs are slightly larger than sand or coffee grounds. *Pouches hold fine cut or snuff tobacco in a small, teabag-like pouch. They are initially less messy because the tobacco will not fall out of the user's fingers and mouth. Dipping tobacco in pouches resemble snus \\"portions\\", but the difference between these two products lies in the way the tobacco is processed. Dipping tobacco (including pouched products) undergoes fermentation, whereas tobacco in snus is pasteurized. In addition to regular sized pouches, smaller sized pouches, known as Bandits, are also available in the Skoal brand, Grizzly brand, and Copenhagen brand. =Unique cut sizes= The following cuts are either unique to one brand of dipping tobacco or are extremely rare. *Fat cuts are a little longer, flatter, and softer than long cut. *Mid cuts are comparable to small granules at about 1 mm cubed. Mid cuts are extremely rare; the original version of Copenhagen Black is the only dip marketed as a mid cut that has made it to the market. However, many consider some products marketed as long cuts to be mid cuts, notably Copenhagen Long Cut Original. *ReadyCut is a cut produced only by Skoal (introduced in 2012) which consists of a compressed cube of long cut. As it gets moist from saliva in the mouth, it automatically conforms to the user's mouth. *Wide cut is a new cut introduced by Grizzly in select markets. It consists of wider strands than long cut. Grizzly Wide Cut Wintergreen is the only wide cut available. Flavoring Dipping tobacco is typically flavored. The most common flavors consist of mint, wintergreen, straight, and natural.  Health issues  = Effects = Dipping tobacco, like other tobacco products, contains the stimulant nicotine. Effects include increased heart rate, an increase in systolic blood pressure, and an increase in adrenaline. = Long-term effects = Long term use results in whitening of the oral mucosa, termed smokeless tobacco keratosis. There is relatively low risk of transformation of this lesion into mouth cancer (sometimes verrucous carcinoma). Dipping tobacco is believed to cause fatal oral cancers, tooth and gum loss. Associated cancers include: tongue cancer, lip cancer, cheek cancer, gum cancer, throat cancer, and cancer in the roof and floor of the mouth. In a comprehensive review of all reports from previous years, one study noted \\"The use of moist snuff and chewing tobacco imposes minimal risks for cancers of the oral cavity and other upper respiratory sites, with relative risks ranging from 0.6 to 1.7.\\" A study comparing oral cancer mortality rates of West Virginia (the state with the highest consumption of smokeless tobacco) in the early nineties to the US overall average throughout the years 1950 to 1980 found no apparent increased incidence or mortality. A study, pooling results from 11 studies between 1981 and 2006, found that users of smokeless tobacco are at elevated risk of getting head and neck cancer, particularly oral cavity cancer. = Cardiovascular effects = Studies are inconclusive as to how significantly smokeless tobacco affects users' cardiovascular systems, but it has been suggested that it may have less nicotine than cigarettes. One study states that, \\"Although the evidence is not conclusive, the adverse cardiovascular effects of smokeless tobacco use are less than those caused by smoking but are more than those found in non-users.\\" Other studies also indicate that smokeless tobacco related cardiovascular risks are lower than that of smoked tobacco. One study states that smokeless tobacco use has a \\"positive effect on cardiovascular risk factors in young physically fit men.\\" However, one Indian study from the state of Rajasthan states, \\"There is a significantly greater prevalence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors obesity, resting tachycardia, hypertension, high total and LDL cholesterol, and low HDL cholesterol, and electrocardiographic changes in tobacco users, chewing or smoking, as compared-to tobacco non-users. Chewing tobacco is associated with similar cardiovascular risk as smoking.\\" Due to contrasting results in studies, many conclude that further research should be done on the cardiovascular risks of smokeless tobacco. = Addiction potential = Smokeless tobacco contains nicotine, which is addictive thus the primary reinforcing agent. According to European Union policy advice, Scandinavian or some American smokeless tobaccos (specifically snus) may be up to 90% less hazardous than cigarette smoking. However, the habit is still addictive. Taxation and restriction of smoking is causing more smokeless tobacco use as \\"substitution.\\" There have been public health debates regarding risk-reduction for smokers and the reconsideration of smokeless tobacco risks. \\"...There is a substantial body of informed and independent opinion that sees the value of harm reduction strategies based on smokeless tobacco.\\"UK's Action on Smoking & Health (ASH..) Accessed on 31 July 2007. = Additives = The amount of nicotine absorbed can be controlled by different cutting of the tobacco, increasing the nicotine concentration and raising the pH of the tobacco by adding various salts. An alkaline pH causes more nicotine to be absorbed, especially the free, unprotonated form, but is irritating to the mucosa. Nicotine itself can also irritate the mucosa.  List of brands  The following is a partial list of brands of dipping tobacco. Other tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco and snus, are excluded.http://www.doj.state.or.us/tobacco/pdf/smokeless_tobacco_directory.pdf * Copenhagen * Grizzly Also Known As The \\"Welfare Bear\\" * Happy Days * Husky * Kodiak * Longhorn * Red Man * Red Seal * Rooster (discontinued in 2009) *Stoker's * Skoal * Timber Wolf * Outlaw Dip * Tough Guy  Legality  Several countries have banned the sale (and in some cases the import) of dipping tobacco. Sale of dipping tobacco was banned in South Australia in 1986 and across the country in 1991 and in most of the EU nations in 1993. Sweden was exempt from this ban because of the traditionally high usage of snus in that country. Dipping tobacco is also not currently permitted for sale in the UK. It is not yet clear whether this law will be changed when the UK leaves the EU.Sharrow Mills, \\"The Encyclopaedia of Tobacco\\", Sharrow Mills, 2018 In the United States, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act gives the Food and Drug Administration the power to regulate the tobacco industry. This law prohibits the sale of dipping tobacco to anyone under the age of 21, as of 20 December restricts tobacco product advertising and marketing directed to younger audiences, and requires bigger, more prominent warning labels for dipping tobacco products. Taxation In the United States, the federal government taxes dipping tobacco at , equivalent to 3.15¬¢ per package. Excise taxes are also levied at the state level (Pennsylvania being the only exception), and in some instances, at the local level. Sales tax is also applied to the full retail price of dipping tobacco in most jurisdictions. The price of a tin of tobacco can range anywhere from under $1 per tin to more than $8. Price is affected by factors such as brand and especially the varying excise taxes from state to state.

The left-footer played for the New York Jets, New Orleans Saints, and Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League in the United States. Graham's 219 game Australian Rules career was played exclusively at the Geelong Football Club in the Australian Football League between 1993 and 2004. As an Aussie Rules player, Graham was long noted for his ability to kick extraordinarily long distances with accuracy (in particular his expertise at the torpedo punt). This is one of the key reasons that he was believed to have potential as a professional NFL punter. He is the only player to be named a captain of both an AFL and NFL side. During his career he has played in the biggest game in two codes, the AFL Grand Final (1995 AFL Grand Final) and the Super Bowl (Super Bowl XLIII). He was the first Australian to have played in a Super Bowl.

Ben Graham grew up in Leopold, Victoria, and began playing Aussie Rules at a young age for the local Leopold Football ClubLeopold Football Netball Club. leopoldlions.com.au in the Bellarine Football League where his father was former premiership player and coach. Ben's football ability was obvious from an early age, and he was selected by the Geelong U19s (now Geelong Falcons) where he was first identified by AFL talent scouts. Australian rules football career Graham was recruited by Geelong at pick 40 in the 1992 Australian Football League (AFL) pre-season draft. He was Geelong's \\"Best First Year Player\\" in the reserves team of 1992, and made his debut with the Geelong seniors late in 1993. Graham was noted for his long kicking (in particular his expertise at the torpedo punt), and could play at both ends of the ground as a key position player. He played at centre half-forward and could convert goals from distances of 60 metres, as well as playing at centre half-back, where his booming kicks cleared the ball from defence, particularly during kickouts. Against Port Adelaide in Round 19, 1999, when Graham was bringing the ball back in from play, he booted the ball just over 85 metres, which was past the centre circle of Simonds Stadium. Graham played in Geelong's 1995 AFL Grand Final loss to Carlton. For the year, he was named most improved player at Geelong. Graham won the club's best and fairest award (the Carji Greeves Medal) in 1999. He following his 1999 season with another solid season in 2000, finishing runner up in the best & fairest in a year in which he was also bestowed the honour of the club captaincy. In 2001, he was inducted into the Geelong Football Club Hall of Fame and granted life membership.

In 2004, he surprised many in Australia when he quit Australian rules football and left for the United States to pursue a career as a punter in the National Football League, where he would ultimately be paid many times more than he would have earned in Australia and extended his playing career by many years. =New York Jets= Graham was signed to a short-term contract by the New York Jets in January 2005. He moved to New York City and attended Jets training camp at Hofstra University, before being confirmed as the team's starting punter for the 2005 NFL season when his predecessor Micah Knorr was released. When Graham played his first NFL regular season game, (against the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium on 11 September 2005) he became the second person after Darren Bennett to play in both the AFL and the NFL (Colin Ridgeway played at AFL reserves level for Carlton), and fourth Australian NFL player. He also became the oldest rookie ever to be part of an NFL opening day roster at age 31. On 22 May 2006, the Jets signed Graham to a six-year contract worth US$5.17 million. In late 2006, Graham made history becoming the first Australian to captain an American pro-sports team when he joined the leadership group of the New York Jets.

Published on November 22, 1787 under the name \\"Publius\\", Federalist No. 10 is among the most highly regarded of all American political writings. No. 10 addresses the question of how to reconcile citizens with interests contrary to the rights of others or inimical to the interests of the community as a whole. Madison saw factions as inevitable due to the nature of man‚Äîthat is, as long as people hold differing opinions, have differing amounts of wealth and own differing amount of property, they will continue to form alliances with people who are most similar to them and they will sometimes work against the public interest and infringe upon the rights of others. He thus questions how to guard against those dangers. Federalist No. 10 continues a theme begun in Federalist No. 9 and is titled \\"The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection\\". The whole series is cited by scholars and jurists as an authoritative interpretation and explication of the meaning of the Constitution. Historians such as Charles A. Beard argue that No. 10 shows an explicit rejection by the Founding Fathers of the principles of direct democracy and factionalism, and argue that Madison suggests that a representative republic is more effective against partisanship and factionalism. Madison saw the Constitution as forming a \\"happy combination\\" of a republic and a democracy, with \\"the great and aggregate interests being referred to the national, the local and particular to the State legislatures\\" resulting in a decentralized governmental structure. In his view, this would make it \\"more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried.\\" Background U.S. Constitution Prior to the Constitution, the thirteen states were bound together by the Articles of Confederation. These were, in essence, a military alliance between sovereign nations adopted to better fight the Revolutionary War. Congress had no power to tax, and as a result, was not able to pay debts resulting from the Revolution. Madison, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin and others feared a break-up of the union and national bankruptcy. Like Washington, Madison felt the revolution had not resolved the social problems that had triggered it, and the excesses ascribed to the King were now being repeated by the state legislatures. In this view, Shays' Rebellion, an armed uprising in Massachusetts in 1786, was simply one, albeit extreme, example of \\"democratic excess\\" in the aftermath of the War. A national convention was called for May 1787, to revise the Articles of Confederation. Madison believed that the problem was not with the Articles, but rather the state legislatures, and so the solution was not to fix the articles but to restrain the excesses of the states. The principal questions before the convention became whether the states should remain sovereign, whether sovereignty should be transferred to the national government, or whether a settlement should rest somewhere in between. By mid-June, it was clear that the convention was drafting a new plan of government around these issues‚Äîa constitution. Madison's nationalist position shifted the debate increasingly away from a position of pure state sovereignty, and toward the compromise. In a debate on June 26, he said that government ought to \\"protect the minority of the opulent against the majority\\" and that unchecked, democratic communities were subject to \\"the turbulency and weakness of unruly passions\\". Publication thumb September 17, 1787 marked the signing of the final document. By its own Article Seven, the constitution drafted by the convention needed ratification by at least nine of the thirteen states, through special conventions held in each state. Anti-Federalist writers began to publish essays and letters arguing against ratification, and Alexander Hamilton recruited James Madison and John Jay to write a series of pro-ratification letters in response. Like most of the Federalist essays and the vast majority of The Federalist Papers, No. 10 first appeared in popular newspapers. It was first printed in the Daily Advertiser under the name adopted by the Federalist writers, \\"Publius\\"; in this it was remarkable among the essays of Publius, as almost all of them first appeared in one of two other papers: the Independent Journal and the New-York Packet. Federalist No. 37, also by Madison, was the only other essay to appear first in the Advertiser. Considering the importance later ascribed to the essay, it was reprinted only on a limited scale. On November 23, it appeared in the Packet and the next day in the Independent Journal. Outside New York City, it made four appearances in early 1788: January 2 in the Pennsylvania Gazette, January 10 in the Hudson Valley Weekly, January 15 in the Lansingburgh Northern Centinel, and January 17 in the Albany Gazette. Though this number of reprintings was typical for The Federalist essays, many other essays, both Federalist and Anti-Federalist, saw much wider distribution. On January 1, 1788, the publishing company J. & A. McLean announced that they would publish the first 36 of the essays in a single volume. This volume, titled The Federalist, was released on March 2, 1788. George Hopkins' 1802 edition revealed that Madison, Hamilton, and Jay were the authors of the series, with two later printings dividing the work by author. In 1818, James Gideon published a third edition containing corrections by Madison, who by that time had completed his two terms as President of the United States. Henry B. Dawson's edition of 1863 sought to collect the original newspaper articles, though he did not always find the first instance. It was much reprinted, albeit without his introduction. Paul Leicester Ford's 1898 edition included a table of contents which summarized the essays, with the summaries again used to preface their respective essays. The first date of publication and the newspaper name were recorded for each essay. Of modern editions, Jacob E. Cooke's 1961 edition is seen as authoritative, and is most used today. The question of faction Federalist No. 10 continues the discussion of the question broached in Hamilton's Federalist No. 9. Hamilton there addressed the destructive role of a faction in breaking apart the republic. The question Madison answers, then, is how to eliminate the negative effects of faction. Madison defines a faction as \\"a number of citizens, whether amounting to a minority or majority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community\\". He identifies the most serious source of faction to be the diversity of opinion in political life which leads to dispute over fundamental issues such as what regime or religion should be preferred. At the heart of Madison's fears about factions was the unequal distribution of property in society. Ultimately, \\"the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property,\\" Madison argues (Dawson 1863, p. 58). Since some people owned property and others owned none, Madison felt that people would form different factions that pursued different interests. \\"Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society,\\" he notes (Dawson 1863, p. 58). Providing some examples of the distinct interests, Madison identified a landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, and \\"many lesser interests\\" (Dawson 1863, p. 58). They all belonged to \\"different classes\\" that were \\"actuated by different sentiments and views,\\" Madison insists (Dawson 1863, p. 58). In other words, Madison argued that the unequal distribution of property led to the creation of different classes that formed different factions and pursued different class interests. Moreover, Madison feared the formation of a certain kind of faction. Recognizing that the country's wealthiest property owners formed a minority and that the country's unpropertied classes formed a majority, Madison feared that the unpropertied classes would come together to form a majority faction that gained control of the government. Against \\"the minor party,\\" there could emerge \\"an interested and overbearing majority,\\" Madison warns (Dawson 1863, pp. 55‚Äì56). Specifically, Madison feared that the unpropertied classes would use their majority power to implement a variety of measures that redistributed wealth. There could be \\"a rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other improper or wicked project,\\" Madison warns (Dawson 1863, p. 64). In short, Madison feared that a majority faction of the unpropertied classes might emerge to redistribute wealth and property in a way that benefited the majority of the population at the expense of the country's richest and wealthiest people. Like the anti-Federalists who opposed him, Madison was substantially influenced by the work of Montesquieu, though Madison and Montesquieu disagreed on the question addressed in this essay. He also relied heavily on the philosophers of the Scottish Enlightenment, especially David Hume, whose influence is most clear in Madison's discussion of the types of faction and in his argument for an extended republic. Madison's arguments Madison first assessed that there are two ways to limit the damage caused by faction: either remove the causes of faction or control its effects. He then describes the two methods to removing the causes of faction: first, destroying liberty, which would work because \\"liberty is to faction what air is to fire\\", but it is impossible to perform because liberty is essential to political life, just as air is \\"essential to animal life.\\" After all, Americans fought for it during the American Revolution. The second option, creating a society homogeneous in opinions and interests, is impracticable. The diversity of the people's ability is what makes them succeed more or less, and inequality of property is a right that the government should protect. Madison particularly emphasizes that economic stratification prevents everyone from sharing the same opinion. Madison concludes that the damage caused by faction can be limited only by controlling its effects. He then argues that the only problem comes from majority factions because the principle of popular sovereignty should prevent minority factions from gaining power. Madison offers two ways to check majority factions: prevent the \\"existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at the same time\\" or render a majority faction unable to act. Madison concludes that a small democracy cannot avoid the dangers of majority faction because small size means that undesirable passions can very easily spread to a majority of the people, which can then enact its will through the democratic government without difficulty. Madison states, \\"The latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man\\", so the cure is to control their effects. He makes an argument on how this is not possible in a pure democracy but possible in a republic. With pure democracy, he means a system in which every citizen votes directly for laws, and, with republic, he intends a society in which citizens elect a small body of representatives who then vote for laws. He indicates that the voice of the people pronounced by a body of representatives is more conformable to the interest of the community, since, again, common people's decisions are affected by their self-interest. He then makes an argument in favor of a large republic against a small republic for the choice of \\"fit characters\\" to represent the public's voice. In a large republic, where the number of voters and candidates is greater, the probability to elect competent representatives is broader. The voters have a wider option. In a small republic, it would also be easier for the candidates to fool the voters but more difficult in a large one. The last argument Madison makes in favor of a large republic is that as, in a small republic, there will be a lower variety of interests and parties, a majority will more frequently be found. The number of participants of that majority will be lower, and, since they live in a more limited territory, it would be easier for them to agree and work together for the accomplishment of their ideas. While in a large republic the variety of interests will be greater so to make it harder to find a majority. Even if there is a majority, it would be harder for them to work together because of the large number of people and the fact they are spread out in a wider territory. A republic, Madison writes, is different from a democracy because its government is placed in the hands of delegates, and, as a result of this, it can be extended over a larger area. The idea is that, in a large republic, there will be more \\"fit characters\\" to choose from for each delegate. Also, the fact that each representative is chosen from a larger constituency should make the \\"vicious arts\\" of electioneering (a reference to rhetoric) less effective. For instance, in a large republic, a corrupt delegate would need to bribe many more people in order to win an election than in a small republic. Also, in a republic, the delegates both filter and refine the many demands of the people so as to prevent the type of frivolous claims that impede purely democratic governments. Though Madison argued for a large and diverse republic, the writers of the Federalist Papers recognized the need for a balance. They wanted a republic diverse enough to prevent faction but with enough commonality to maintain cohesion among the states. In Federalist No. 2, John Jay counted as a blessing that America possessed \\"one united people‚Äîa people descended from the same ancestors, the same language, professing the same religion\\". Madison himself addresses a limitation of his conclusion that large constituencies will provide better representatives. He notes that if constituencies are too large, the representatives will be \\"too little acquainted with all their local circumstances and lesser interests\\". He says that this problem is partly solved by federalism. No matter how large the constituencies of federal representatives, local matters will be looked after by state and local officials with naturally smaller constituencies. Contemporaneous counterarguments George Clinton, believed to be the Anti- Federalist writer Cato The Anti-Federalists vigorously contested the notion that a republic of diverse interests could survive. The author Cato (another pseudonym, most likely that of George Clinton) summarized the Anti-Federalist position in the article Cato no. 3: > Whoever seriously considers the immense extent of territory comprehended > within the limits of the United States, with the variety of its climates, > productions, and commerce, the difference of extent, and number of > inhabitants in all; the dissimilitude of interest, morals, and policies, in > almost every one, will receive it as an intuitive truth, that a consolidated > republican form of government therein, can never form a perfect union, > establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, promote the general welfare, > and secure the blessings of liberty to you and your posterity, for to these > objects it must be directed: this unkindred legislature therefore, composed > of interests opposite and dissimilar in their nature, will in its exercise, > emphatically be, like a house divided against itself. Generally, it was their position that republics about the size of the individual states could survive, but that a republic on the size of the Union would fail. A particular point in support of this was that most of the states were focused on one industry‚Äîto generalize, commerce and shipping in the northern states and plantation farming in the southern. The Anti-Federalist belief that the wide disparity in the economic interests of the various states would lead to controversy was perhaps realized in the American Civil War, which some scholars attribute to this disparity. Madison himself, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson, noted that differing economic interests had created dispute, even when the Constitution was being written. At the convention, he particularly identified the distinction between the northern and southern states as a \\"line of discrimination\\" that formed \\"the real difference of interests\\". The discussion of the ideal size for the republic was not limited to the options of individual states or encompassing union. In a letter to Richard Price, Benjamin Rush noted that \\"Some of our enlightened men who begin to despair of a more complete union of the States in Congress have secretly proposed an Eastern, Middle, and Southern Confederacy, to be united by an alliance offensive and defensive\\". In making their arguments, the Anti- Federalists appealed to both historical and theoretic evidence. On the theoretical side, they leaned heavily on the work of Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu. The Anti-Federalists Brutus and Cato both quoted Montesquieu on the issue of the ideal size of a republic, citing his statement in The Spirit of the Laws that: > It is natural to a republic to have only a small territory, otherwise it > cannot long subsist. In a large republic there are men of large fortunes, > and consequently of less moderation; there are trusts too great to be placed > in any single subject; he has interest of his own; he soon begins to think > that he may be happy, great and glorious, by oppressing his fellow citizens; > and that he may raise himself to grandeur on the ruins of his country. In a > large republic, the public good is sacrificed to a thousand views; it is > subordinate to exceptions, and depends on accidents. In a small one, the > interest of the public is easier perceived, better understood, and more > within the reach of every citizen; abuses are of less extent, and of course > are less protected. Greece and Rome were looked to as model republics throughout this debate, and authors on both sides took Roman pseudonyms. Brutus points out that the Greek and Roman states were small, whereas the U.S. is vast. He also points out that the expansion of these republics resulted in a transition from free government to tyranny. Modern analysis and reaction In the first century of the American republic, No. 10 was not regarded as among the more important numbers of The Federalist. For example, in Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville refers specifically to more than fifty of the essays, but No. 10 is not among them. Today, however, No. 10 is regarded as a seminal work of American democracy. In \\"The People's Vote\\", a popular survey conducted by the National Archives and Records Administration, National History Day, and U.S. News and World Report, No. 10 (along with Federalist No. 51, also by Madison) was chosen as the 20th most influential document in United States history. David Epstein, writing in 1984, described it as among the most highly regarded of all American political writing. The historian Charles A. Beard identified Federalist No. 10 as one of the most important documents for understanding the Constitution. In his book An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States (1913), Beard argued that Madison produced a detailed explanation of the economic factors that lay behind the creation of the Constitution. At the outset of his study, Beard writes that Madison provided \\"a masterly statement of the theory of economic determinism in politics\\" (Beard 1913, p. 15). Later in his study, Beard repeated his point, providing more emphasis. \\"The most philosophical examination of the foundations of political science is made by Madison in the tenth number,\\" Beard writes. \\"Here he lays down, in no uncertain language, the principle that the first and elemental concern of every government is economic\\" (Beard 1913, p. 156). Douglass Adair attributes the increased interest in the tenth number to Charles A. Beard's book An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution, published in 1913. Adair also contends that Beard's selective focus on the issue of class struggle, and his political progressivism, has colored modern scholarship on the essay. According to Adair, Beard reads No. 10 as evidence for his belief in \\"the Constitution as an instrument of class exploitation\\". Adair's own view is that Federalist No. 10 should be read as \\"eighteenth- century political theory directed to an eighteenth-century problem; and ... one of the great creative achievements of that intellectual movement that later ages have christened 'Jeffersonian democracy'\\". Garry Wills is a noted critic of Madison's argument in Federalist No. 10. In his book Explaining America, he adopts the position of Robert Dahl in arguing that Madison's framework does not necessarily enhance the protections of minorities or ensure the common good. Instead, Wills claims: \\"Minorities can make use of dispersed and staggered governmental machinery to clog, delay, slow down, hamper, and obstruct the majority. But these weapons for delay are given to the minority irrespective of its factious or nonfactious character; and they can be used against the majority irrespective of its factious or nonfactious character. What Madison prevents is not faction, but action. What he protects is not the common good but delay as such\\". Application Federalist No. 10 is the classic citation for the belief that the Founding Fathers and the constitutional framers did not intend American politics to be partisan. For instance, United States Supreme Court justice John Paul Stevens cites the paper for the statement, \\"Parties ranked high on the list of evils that the Constitution was designed to check\\". Discussing a California provision that forbids candidates from running as independents within one year of holding a partisan affiliation, Justice Byron White made apparent the Court's belief that Madison spoke for the framers of the Constitution: \\"California apparently believes with the Founding Fathers that splintered parties and unrestrained factionalism may do significant damage to the fabric of government. See The Federalist, No. 10 (Madison)\\". Madison's argument that restraining liberty to limit faction is an unacceptable solution has been used by opponents of campaign finance limits. Justice Clarence Thomas, for example, invoked Federalist No. 10 in a dissent against a ruling supporting limits on campaign contributions, writing: \\"The Framers preferred a political system that harnessed such faction for good, preserving liberty while also ensuring good government. Rather than adopting the repressive 'cure' for faction that the majority today endorses, the Framers armed individual citizens with a remedy\\".

The principles which inspired its foundation are contained in the Ventotene Manifesto, drawn up in 1941 by Spinelli himself, Eugenio Colorni, Ursula Hirschmann and Ernesto Rossi. Vayssi√®re notes that the manifesto is widely seen as the birth of European federalism. Spinelli (1907‚Äì86), a former Communist, became a leader of the federalist movement due to his primary authorship of the Manifesto and his postwar advocacy. The manifesto called for a break with Europe's past to form a new political system through a restructuring of politics and extensive social reform. It was presented not as an ideal, but as the best option for the Europe's postwar condition. Federalism represented in the 1940s a revolutionary and entirely innovative political idea. According to the federalists, the new line between progressive and reactionary forces was the one that existed between those for whom the key task is to create a federal European state, and those who consciously or de facto acted to maintain a diversity of sovereign nation-states.

It is the civilian version of the Heckler & Koch G36. The rifle fires the .223 Remington or 5.56√ó45mm NATO cartridge and feeds from a 10-, 20- or 30-round detachable magazine (depending on the variant of the rifle). Unlike earlier types of HK rifles, it is not a roller lock bolt but rather a lug-type rotating bolt system as seen on the AR-18. Design To adapt the G36 for the civilian market, its pistol grip and folding stock have been replaced by a fixed stock with a thumbhole. The receiver has also been modified to prevent the attachment of a folding stock. In addition, to comply with the Gun Control Act of 1968, SL8 rifles exported to the United States have been modified so that they will not accept staggered 20- and 30-round G36 magazines, only accepting single stack, 10-round magazines. Other modifications have been made to the SL8, including a lightened trigger pull, adjustable cheekpiece and buttplate to customize the fit to the user, and a heavier, more accurate barrel. The SL8 does not come with the carry handle and built-in optics of the G36, although these can be purchased aftermarket and fitted to the weapon. American owners can modify their SL8s to accept 30-round G36 magazines and 100-round drum magazines. Doing so requires that the single-lug SL8 bolt head is replaced with a double-lug G36 bolt head, the magazine well is replaced, and the receiver is modified to permit insertion of a wider magazine body. However, such modifications to SL8 rifles (or indeed to any imported rifles) have significant implications under the 1968 Gun Control Act, which prohibits (inter alia) the assembly from imported parts of rifles that could not themselves be imported. Variants =SL8 (no -#)= This is the grey EU and Canada version that has a double-stack magazine, non-vented forearm and a short sight rail. =SL8-1= The SL8-1 is the grey US-import version of the rifle. It has a single-stack magazine and its sighting system consists of a long rail with ironsights. The bolt is slightly modified to accommodate the single-stack magazine. The forearm is not vented. =SL8-2= Very rare, this version was designed as the new DMR for the German Bundeswehr, although in the end it was not adopted. It was to be issued with bipod and G36 type 3.5√ó optic. =SL8-4= The H&K; SL8-4 is a SL8 with standard G36 handguard and double stacked magazine with G36 bolt carrier group. =SL8-5= The SL8-5 differs from the SL8-4 only in that it uses the same long rail with ironsights as the SL8-1. =SL8-6= This is a black SL8-1 with short sight rail and vented forearm. This is the most popular version of this rifle on the US market. As of July 28, 2010 the SL8-6 has been discontinued within the USA. =SL8-10= A new model with short rail chambered for the .222 Remington cartridge to respect laws that prohibit certain countries' inhabitants from owning weapons in military cartridges. Mostly made for export to Spain, but it is also available in .223 Remington, like previous models, to replace the SL8-4. Other versions =SL9SD= A semi-automatic rifle, gas-operated bolt with rotary bolt head using 7.62√ó37mm (.300 Whisper - a subsonic round made by necking up the .221 Remington Fireball case to .308\\" and using a 240 gr Sierra MatchKing bullet.) The cartridge will fit and feed from all standard 5.56√ó45mm NATO magazines. The Whisper has effectively the same power and weight as a standard .45 ACP, but the lower calibre greatly increases armor penetration. The SL9SD uses 10- and 30-round magazines, is 1150 mm (O/A length), 270 mm (height), 58 mm (width) and weighs 4.6 kg (with suppressor). =HK R8= A modified version of the SL8, known as the R8, is manufactured with a straight-pull bolt action and uses either a 5- or 10-round magazine. These changes were made to allow the rifle to be marketed to sporting shooters in countries with more stringent gun control laws, such as the United Kingdom and Australia. It retains the general appearance of the SL8 though has a similar sight and carrying handle to the G36 rifle, and is available in black or grey. In April 2008, the government of the Australian state of Victoria said that the R8 may be convertible to semi- or fully automatic firing in violation of state law. Heckler & Koch stated that the rifle was built from the ground up as a bolt-action firearm and that any rifle can be converted to full automatic.Buttler, Mark. \\"'Convertible' guns banned\\" Herald Sun, Melbourne. 15 April 2008 In March 2009, the Victoria Police Commissioner officially reclassified the HK R8 to \\"Category D\\", restricted to police and military users, because it \\"substantially duplicates a militaristic firearm in design, function or appearance.\\"\\"Approved Handgun Club Newsletter\\" Victoria Police, Licensing Services Division.

The series starred Jeff Yagher, Cheryl Pollak, Spencer Klein, Eddie Velez, Antonia Jones, Bruce McGill, Wanda De Jesus, Hill Harper, Sam Anderson, Rebecca Staab, and Michael Watson. Karen Austin, Debra Eisenstadt, Leigh Hall, Ana Gabriel, Evan Arnold, Yolanda Gaskins, Morgan Hunter, Terry Kiser, Nia Long, Tom Byrd, Marie Marshall, and Chase Masterson were all recurring on the show. Premise The show centered on fictional television station, KXZX, in Los Angeles's Re-Action News. It was an ensemble piece, one of the rare occasions in television where there was no true main character. Most notable in the show's run was an early use of an ongoing story arc centering on the murder of a Los Angeles socialite. As the show was canceled with little warning, the story arc was never resolved. Also, sports reporter Lou Waller came out of the closet in the last act of the last episode to air. Consequently, the fallout of this event was never shown. Cast and characters =Main= * Jeff Yagher as Alex Rydell ‚Äì The new News Director of KXZX's Re-Action News team. Immediately before joining the team he was working as a news director for a Boston station. Alex's wife decides not to join him in LA, and instead sends their son, Sean, to be with the father alone. One of his problems was dealing both with the stresses of his new job and being a newly single parent. Throughout the show's short run there was a growing attraction between, Alex and one of his producers, Nancy. However the show was canceled before the outcome could be decided. * Cheryl Pollak as Nancy Lockridge ‚Äì The Eleven O'Clock News producer. While she was attracted to Alex, she was also reluctant to begin a relationship with him as he was newly separated and had a son, plus he was her boss. In the final episode that aired it appeared as though Alex's wife might want a reconciliation and Nancy encouraged Alex to give his marriage another try for the sake of his son. * Spencer Klein as Sean Rydell ‚Äì Alex's young son. His mother had chosen not to come to LA and sent him to be with his father alone. * David Birney as Harry Chandler \\"The Beacon of Truth\\" Moore ‚Äì The vain, pompous senior news anchor at KXZX. Harry had a love/hate relationship with his co-anchor Sherry Beck. Despite their constant behind the scenes bickering the two of them had an affair. * Eddie Velez as Ricardo Sandoval ‚Äì A 28-year-old study in macho good looks. Ricardo was a \\"Re-Action News\\" anchor and reporter who had been known to focus more attention on the creases in his expensive trousers than the story he's been assigned to cover. * Antonia Jones as Peggy Traynor ‚Äì The news traffic controller. From crashing her car with a faulty brake repair job into Helen Forbes' Mercedes Benz to saving the day when a disastrous fight between Tommy Greer and \\"Fast\\" Eddie Santini breaks out in the midst of a live broadcast knocking over the camera, Peggy dealt with every issue in the news room with a cheerful disposition and a desire to please. * Bruce McGill as Joe Vitale ‚Äì \\"Re‚ÄìAction News\\" Executive producer. * Wanda De Jesus as Liz Vega ‚Äì Investigative news reporter for \\"Re‚ÄìAction News\\". * Hill Harper as Tommy Greer ‚Äì News reporter for \\"Re‚ÄìAction News\\". * Sam Anderson as Marvin Seaborne ‚Äì News commentor for \\"Re‚ÄìAction News\\". * Rebecca Staab as Sherry Beck ‚Äì The co‚Äìanchor of \\"Re‚ÄìAction News\\". * Michael Watson as 'Fast' Eddie Santini ‚Äì A camera operator, specializing in live shots for \\"Re‚ÄìAction News\\". =Recurring= * Karen Austin as Helen Forbes * Ron Canada as Bill Simon * David Coburn as Rick Evers * Debra Eisenstadt as a director * Leigh Hall as Lissa * Ana Gabriel as a director * Evan Arnold as Brian Cayhill * Yolanda Gaskins as Rayneta * Morgan Hunter as Spiro Stavros * Terry Kiser as Raymond Piskoff * Nia Long as Romona Greer * Tom Byrd as Sportscaster Lou Waller * Marie Marshall as Rosie Pomeranz * Chase Masterson as Sheila Rydell * Naya Rivera as Ann Episodes { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"background:#fff;\\" ! style=\\"background:#39f; width:20px\\" No. ! style=\\"background:#39f;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#39f;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background:#39f;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background:#39f; width:135px\\" Original air date } References =Citations= =Sources= * * External links * * Category:UPN original programming Category:1995 American television series debuts Category:1995 American television series endings Category:Television series by CBS Television Studios Category:Television shows set in Los Angeles Category:Television series about show business Category:Television series about television ","title":"Live Shot"},{"id":"2448585","title":"Searching for Jerry Garcia"},{"id":"2448588","text":"Nightmare Ned is an American animated television series which ran from April 19 to August 9, 1997, on ABC.

The show focuses on the life of Ned Needlemeyer (voiced by Courtland Mead), a 10-year-old boy that deals with his daily problems through dark, quirky nightmares.

He was inducted into comic books' Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1996. Biography =Early life= Carl Burgos was born as Max Finkelstein in New York City, the child of Jewish parents. He studied at the National Academy of Design in Manhattan, where, he recalled in the late 1960s, \\"I quit after one year because I couldn't learn enough\\". =Early career= Burgos took a job with the Franklin Engraving Company, which engraved the printing plates for comic books produced by Harry \\"A\\" Chesler, founder of one of that era's comic-book \\"packagers\\" that created comics on demand for publishers entering the new medium. Joining Chesler's studio himself in 1938, Burgos apprenticed by drawing backgrounds and panel borders, and inking the work of comics pencilers. His earliest works include penciling and inking the six-page story \\"The Last Pirate\\", starring Count Rocco and his ship the Emerald Queen, in Centaur Publications' Star Comics vol. 2, #2 (March 1939);Carl Burgos at the Grand Comics Database creating the features \\"Air-Sub DX\\", in Centaur's Amazing Mystery Funnies vol. 2, #4 (April 1939),Golden Age Directory: A and \\"Rocky Dawson\\"; and creating the robot hero the Iron Skull in Centaur's Amazing-Man Comics #5 (Sept. 1939).Nevins, Jess. \\"The Timely Comics Story\\". WebCitation archive. Burgos and others, including Centaur Publications writer- artist Bill Everett, then followed Centaur art director Lloyd Jacquet to Jacquet's own newly formed packager, Funnies, Inc. As Everett later described, \\"Lloyd... had an idea that he wanted to start his own art service ‚Äî to start a small organization to supply artwork and editorial material to publishers. ... He asked me to join him. He also asked Carl Burgos. So we were the nucleus ...\\"Bill Everett interview, originally published in Alter Ego #11, 1978; reprinted in Alter Ego vol. 3, #46 (March 2005); p. 8 of the latter. He added, \\"I don't know how to explain it, but I was still on a freelance basis. That was the agreement we had. The artists, including myself, at Funnies, worked on a freelance basis\\". Following an unsuccessful attempt at a promotional comic to be given away in movie theaters, Funnies, Inc.'s first sale was to publisher Martin Goodman's equally new Timely Comics, the predecessor of Marvel Comics, supplying the contents of Marvel Comics #1 (Oct. 1939). That landmark issue included not only writer-artist Burgos' Human Torch but also Everett's hit character the Sub-Mariner. A painted cover by veteran science- fiction pulp artist Frank R. Paul featured the Torch. Burgos' character proved a hit, and quickly went on to headline one of comics' first single-character titles, The Human Torch (premiering fall 1940 with no cover date and as issue #2, having taken over the numbering from the single-issue Red Raven).The Human Torch at Don Markstein's Toonopedia He next created the superhero character the White Streak in Novelty Press' Target Comics #1 (Feb. 1940), and, with writer John Compton, the superhero the Thunderer in Timely's Daring Mystery Comics #7 (April 1941).

Note: Gives erroneous birth year. for which he took infantry ranger training and was sent overseas as a rifleman before being transferred to the Signal Corps and then to an engineer division. =Atlas and the 1950s= Following his return from the war, Burgos attended City College of New York to study advertising, and drew a small number of stories for Timely, including anthological crime dramas in Official True Crime Cases Comics #24 (Fall 1947), and Complete Mystery #3-4 (Dec. 1948 ‚Äì Feb. 1949).Carl Burgos in AtlasTales.com Other work included penciling a Captain America story in Marvel Mystery Comics #92 (June 1949), and inking fellow Timely mainstays Mike Sekowsky and Syd Shores on, respectively, at least one story each starring Sun Girl and the Blonde Phantom (both in Marvel Mystery Comics #89, Dec. 1948). Segueing out of full-time comics work, Burgos eased into a career in advertising and commercial art while freelancing frequently for Atlas Comics, the 1950s iteration of Marvel, primarily as a cover artist across all genres from jungle-girl to war comics, though fellow Atlas artist Stan Goldberg, who joined the company in 1949, recalled in 2002 that \\"Burgos was on staff most of the time I was there\\".Interview with Atlas/Marvel artist Stan Goldberg, Alter Ego #18 (Oct. 2002), p. 9 I.W. Publications' Dr. Fu Manchu #1 (1958), reprinting material from Avon Comics. Cover art by Burgos. His most prominent comics work during this time came during Atlas' mid-1950s attempt at reviving the dormant superhero field with Timely stars the Human Torch, the Sub-Mariner, and Captain America, with Burgos drawing the Human Torch stories in Young Men #25‚Äì28 (Feb.‚ÄìJune 1954), as well as the covers of Young Men #24‚Äì25 (Dec. 1953 ‚Äì Feb. 1954) and of the short-lived relaunch Human Torch #36‚Äì38 (April‚ÄìAug. 1954); he also redrew at least the Human Torch figure in the first panel of artist Russ Heath's nine-page story \\"The Return Of The Human Torch\\" in Young Men #24. Burgos during the '50s also contributed to the Atlas humor comics Crazy, Wild, and Riot; the Western comic Annie Oakley; and science-fiction/horror anthologies, including Astonishing, Journey Into Unknown Worlds, Strange Stories of Suspense and Strange Tales of the Unusual, among many others. His last credited Atlas story was the five-page \\"Dateline - Iwo Jima\\" in Battle #70 (June 1960). He did humor for Pierce Publishing's Frantic, Satire Publications' Loco, and Major Magazines' Cracked during 1958 and 1959, as well as layout art for the MLJ/Archie Comics series The Adventures of The Fly and The Double Life of Private Strong. Burgos also provided illustrations for Marvel publisher Martin Goodman's 1950s pulp magazines, including Marvel Science Stories and Western Magazine; as well as covers for the reprint publisher I.W. Publications. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Burgos worked for the Pro-Art Company and later for the Belwin Company, where he drew covers for sheet-music books, sometimes assisted by Susan Burgos, one of his two daughters. He also worked for a greeting-card company. =Silver Age and afterward= In the mid-1960s, during the era fans and historians call the Silver Age of Comic Books, Burgos pursued a lawsuit against Marvel to assert ownership of the Human Torch, whose name and superpowers had been used for the Fantastic Four's Johnny Storm since 1961. Little, if anything, came of this legal action.Interview with daughter Susan Burgos, Alter Ego #49, June 2005, \\"The Privacy Act of Carl Burgos\\", p. 9: \\"I know he had a lawsuit against Marvel Comics. ... I do know that he went to see a lawyer. I assume it was about getting the rights to the Human Torch, and I read in Alter Ego that they settled out of court. I'm sure that's what happened the day he threw [all his Golden Age comics] away [in 1966]. I have no idea how it was settled or even if it went to court, though I don't think it did\\" Burgos nonetheless contributed art to a Johnny Storm Human Torch story in Strange Tales #123 (Aug. 1964), as well as to three Giant-Man stories in Tales to Astonish #62‚Äì64 (Dec. 1964 ‚Äì Feb. 1965). Burgos drew himself and writer-editor Stan Lee into the final panel of the Torch story, with Lee adding the avuncular dialog: > Stan (referring to the Torch and the Thing): \\"There go the greatest guys in > the world, Carl.\\" > Carl: \\"Aw, you're just prejudiced, Stan.\\" Fellow Atlas/Marvel artist Stan Goldberg observed in 2005, \\"Carl and Stan never really got along, because their personalities clashed. When Atlas became Marvel, Carl never really got back into the company, or really into comics, either\\". Marvel eventually revived Burgos' original Human Torch for present- day stories, starting with The Fantastic Four Annual #4 (Nov. 1966). That same year, Burgos created a short-lived character called Captain Marvel for Myron Fass' M. F. Enterprises as a result of Fawcett Comics losing its trademark. He was quickly ordered to cease by Marvel Comics.Captain Marvel at Don Markstein's Toonopedia His last recorded comics art was the cover of Captain Marvel #4 (Nov. 1966). From 1971 to 1975, Burgos served as an editor for Fass' Eerie Publications line of black-and-white horror-comic magazines, including Horror Tales, Weird, Tales from the Tomb, Tales of Voodoo, Terror Tales, Weird, and Witches Tales. Through 1984 he edited magazines for Harris Publications. At the time of his death from colon cancer, he lived in Nassau County, New York, on Long Island.

It serves the MBTA Orange Line subway and Silver Line bus rapid transit lines. It is named for the Tufts Medical Center and is built under a wing of the facility that crosses over Washington Street in downtown Boston between Kneeland Street in Chinatown and the Massachusetts Turnpike. The underground Orange Line station consists of two side platforms serving the line's two tracks, while Silver Line buses stop along the sidewalks on the surface next to the station entrance on Washington Street. A secondary entrance is available on Tremont Street one block to the west. Like all Orange Line stations, Tufts Medical Center is accessible. History The South Cove Tunnel (right) under construction in March 1971 In 1914, the Boston Transit Commission considered constructing a station at Bennet Street where the Washington Street Tunnel rose to the surface to meet the Washington Street Elevated. The proposal was rejected due to the steep grade and the proximity to Boylston station. In September 1968, the MBTA began construction of the shell of a station - then called South Cove - and the South Cove Tunnel during what were to be the early stages of the abandoned Interstate 695 project, in anticipation of the future relocation of the Washington Street Elevated. The relocated Orange Line was to run in the median of the extended I-95 in the Southwest Corridor, then replace service on the Needham Line to Needham. Due to a lack of available federal funds, the MBTA financed the $13.3 million project with local bond funds. The tunnel (which reached to Marginal Street) and the station shell were completed in 1972. However, I-695 was cancelled due to local opposition in 1971; the Elevated remained in service, and the South Cove Tunnel and station sat unused. After the plans for I-95 to be extended into downtown fell through in 1973, the state began looking to use the Southwest Corridor for a combined Orange Line and commuter rail corridor. In 1975, the MBTA applied for $29 million in federal grants to extend the South Cove Tunnel to just past Arlington Street and to finish the interior of South Cove station. Construction began in earnest on the Southwest Corridor in 1979. In 1985, as part of a series of station name changes, the MBTA board voted to name the station New England Medical Center, with South Cove retained as a secondary name. The station opened on May 4, 1987, along with eight other stations from Back Bay to Forest Hills. Silver Line service on Washington Street between Nubian and Downtown Crossing started on July 20, 2002, replacing the former route 49 bus. Additional service to South Station (now signed SL4) began on October 15, 2009. The station was renamed to Tufts Medical Center on March 19, 2010 after the New England Medical Center similarly changed its name. (second page) Station layout The station's primary headhouse on Washington Street is located under a large overhanging Tufts Medical Center building The station was constructed under a city block that had been previously cleared for the South Cove urban renewal effort. This gives it several important differences from Chinatown, Downtown Crossing, and State along Washington Street to the north, which were all threaded among existing underground structures. Because it was easier to dig deeply on the empty plot, Tufts Medical Center station has a subsurface fare mezzanine, rather than having faregates located immediately adjacent to the platforms. The platform areas are much wider and taller than the older stations, and the inbound and outbound platforms are directly opposite each other, rather than offset. The station was not constructed directly under Washington Street; it is angled towards Tremont Street to the west, as the line then curves towards Back Bay. Unlike the older stations, there is a single headhouse on the west side of Washington Street rather than smaller entrances on both sides of the street. This entrance is located under an overhang of a Tufts Medical Center building. There is a secondary entrance without elevator access, located on Tremont Street at Oak Street. Adding elevators to the South Cove entrance was considered by the MBTA in 2017. =Artwork= Artwork was added to the station as part of the Arts on the Line program. Four abstract works, titled Caravan, are displayed beside each of the two escalators to the train platforms, They consist of painted aluminum shapes designed by Richard Gubernick, who also has artwork displayed in LaSalle Station in Buffalo, New York. At each station between Forest Hills and Tufts Medical Center, two granite columns near the outside entrance have been inscribed with text. Those at Tufts are \\"Mr. Yee is in the Garden\\" by Maria Gordett and \\"The Great World Transformed\\" by Gish Jen. Bus connections Silver Line buses inbound to Downtown Crossing and South Station at Tufts Medical Center station in 2012 Tufts Medical Center serves both routes of the Washington Street section of the Silver Line, which operates between downtown and . The SL4 section serves South Station, while the SL5 section serves Downtown Crossing and Boylston. Silver Line buses stop at the primary station entrance on Washington Street. The station also sees conventional bus service from three MBTA bus routes. Routes and run on Washington Street and stop at the same location as the Silver Line, while route runs on Tremont Street and is accessed through the station's secondary headhouse.

His speculative fiction is published under the name Brad Strickland except for one novel written as Will Bradley. By a wide margin his work most widely held in WorldCat participating libraries is The Sign of the Sinister Sorcerer (Dial Books, 2008), which concluded the Lewis Barnavelt series created by John Bellairs (1938‚Äì1991). \\"Strickland, Brad\\". WorldCat.org. Retrieved 2015-08-17.  Life  Strickland was born in New Holland, Georgia. His first publication in the speculative fiction genre was \\"Payment Deferred\\", as by Bradley Strickland in the May 1982 issue of Asimov's Science Fiction. His first novel, To Stand Beneath the Sun, was published in 1985. Since, he has written or co-written sixty-plus novels and more than a hundred short stories. His 1992 published as by Will Bradley, Ark Liberty, \\"treats the ecocatastrophic ... near-death of Earth with melodramatic panache, pitting its scientist hero against suicidal governments and embedding him ‚Äì after his physical death ‚Äì into the eponymous undersea biome as its Computer mentor and spirit, while centuries pass.\\" From 1992 Strickland completed four Lewis Barnavelt and Johnny Dixon novels that were at least outlined by John Bellairs; he followed with nine more, bringing both series to twelve volumes. Beginning in 1996 he has created his own stories using the already-established characters. He is also credited for writing novels for the Wishbone series. His 2000 book, When Mack Came Back, won Strickland the 2001 Georgia Author of the Year Award, Children's/Young Adult Division honor. In 2002, Strickland and Thomas E. Fuller began the Pirate Hunter series and, later, the Mars Year One series. Mr. Fuller died before all the books were published. Strickland is a Professor of English at Gainesville State College in Oakwood, Georgia. He is an active member of the Atlanta Radio Theatre Company, writing, adapting and acting in numerous audio drama projects. Reception of works Strickland's books have generally been received favorably. For John Bellairs's Johnny Dixon in the Hand of the Necromancer (1996), Kirkus Reviews wrote \\"Strickland, in his first solo work featuring the characters created by John Bellairs, leads readers on an entertaining frolic. There are enough well-placed frissons to keep readers flipping those pages, even those who know that, in keeping with series formula, all nefarious plans will be nixed. \\" For When Mack Came Back (2000), Kirkus Reviews called it a\\"heart-tugging period piece\\" and \\"Rather than an action adventure, this is a quiet story of a boy who learns to accept himself and of a man who learns to value the steadfast loyalty of a dog.\\" A review of The Tower At The End Of The World (2001) for Kirkus Reviews read that, \\"In comparison to the original [books by John Bellairs], this addition to the series [...] falls short.\\" and \\"For fans of Bellairs hungry for another dose of his spellbinding mystery, this will serve to deaden the thirst, but not quench it.\\" Concerning Grimoire The Curse of the Midions (2006), Kirkus Reviews wrote \\"Strickland offers a conventional but typically fast-paced tale, with nicely lurid touches and plenty of unanswered questions. Good start.\\" For Grimoire Tracked By Terror (2007), Kirkus Reviews wrote \\"Strickland crafts a polished, suspenseful tale, developing a scenario well-stocked with nightmares and traps while building to a battle in which Jarvey becomes a little better at controlling his own magical abilities.

Population Inhabitants of Huelgoat are called in French Huelgoatains. Geography Huelgoat is popular with tourists and holidaymakers due to its impressive natural setting among the vestiges of the ancient forest that once covered inland Brittany. Once part of royal and ducal lands, the forest is now overseen by the French forestry commission, the National Forests Office. It has an area of 10 square kilometres. A large replanting scheme has repaired much of the damage sustained by the forest in storms on the 15‚Äì16 October 1987, when 3.1 square kilometres of trees were levelled or damaged. The village lies on a lake created between the 16th and 18th centuries to supply water to local silver-lead mines by means of a leat or canal. Sights Le Champignon rock, Huelgoat A number of geological and prehistoric curiosities can be found by following trails in and around the village and forest. Among these are: * Le Chaos de Rochers, the Chaos of Rocks, is a jumble of hundreds of large boulders below the dammed lake, into which the river vanishes. A 10 m descent down ladders is required to see it again, running rapidly below a dark cave called the Devil's Grotto. * La Roche Tremblante or Trembling Rock, is a 137-tonne boulder nearby, pivoted so it can be made to rock by a person pushing against one point. * Le Champignon, or The Mushroom, is a large rock balanced on a smaller one to give the eponymous appearance. * La Mare aux F√©es, the fairies' pool. * La Mare aux Sangliers, the wild boar pool. * Le Camp d'Artus, Arthur's Camp, a sea promontory hillfort based on a Gaulish oppidum, with a linear murus gallicus rampart. It was used as refuge by the Osismii Gauls against the Roman invasion in 57 BC and later acquired a nickname referring to Arthurian legend. The site was excavated by Sir Mortimer Wheeler. * La Grotte d'Artus, or Arthur's Cave, is a natural shelter formed under a roof of jammed rocks.

The name comes from an analogy: > Suppose a librarian were to store his books alphabetically on a long shelf, > starting with the As at the left end, and continuing to the right along the > shelf with no spaces between the books until the end of the Zs. If the > librarian acquired a new book that belongs to the B section, once he finds > the correct space in the B section, he will have to move every book over, > from the middle of the Bs all the way down to the Zs in order to make room > for the new book. This is an insertion sort. However, if he were to leave a > space after every letter, as long as there was still space after B, he would > only have to move a few books to make room for the new one. This is the > basic principle of the Library Sort. The algorithm was proposed by Michael A. Bender, Mart√≠n Farach-Colton, and Miguel Mosteiro in 2004 and was published in 2006. Like the insertion sort it is based on, library sort is a comparison sort; however, it was shown to have a high probability of running in O(n log n) time (comparable to quicksort), rather than an insertion sort's O(n2). There is no full implementation given in the paper, nor the exact algorithms of important parts, such as insertion and rebalancing. Further information would be needed to discuss how the efficiency of library sort compares to that of other sorting methods in reality. Compared to basic insertion sort, the drawback of library sort is that it requires extra space for the gaps. The amount and distribution of that space would be implementation dependent. In the paper the size of the needed array is (1 + Œµ)n, but with no further recommendations on how to choose Œµ. Moreover, it is neither adaptive nor stable. In order to warrant the with- high-probability time bounds, it requires to randomly permute the input, what changes the relative order of equal elements and shuffles any presorted input. Also, the algorithm uses binary search to find the insertion point for each element, which does not take profit of presorted input. Another drawback is that it cannot be run as an online algorithm, because it is not possible to randomly shuffle the input. If used without this shuffling, it could easily degenerate into quadratic behaviour. One weakness of insertion sort is that it may require a high number of swap operations and be costly if memory write is expensive. Library sort may improve that somewhat in the insertion step, as fewer elements need to move to make room, but is also adding an extra cost in the rebalancing step. In addition, locality of reference will be poor compared to mergesort as each insertion from a random data set may access memory that is no longer in cache, especially with large data sets. Implementation =Algorithm = Let us say we have an array of n elements. We choose the gap we intend to give. Then we would have a final array of size (1 + Œµ)n. The algorithm works in log n rounds. In each round we insert as many elements as there are in the final array already, before re-balancing the array. For finding the position of inserting, we apply Binary Search in the final array and then swap the following elements till we hit an empty space. Once the round is over, we re-balance the final array by inserting spaces between each element. Following are three important steps of the algorithm: # Binary Search: Finding the position of insertion by applying binary search within the already inserted elements. This can be done by linearly moving towards left or right side of the array if you hit an empty space in the middle element. # Insertion: Inserting the element in the position found and swapping the following elements by 1 position till an empty space is hit. This is done in logarithmic time, with high probability. # Re-Balancing: Inserting spaces between each pair of elements in the array. The cost of rebalancing is linear in the number of elements already inserted. As these lengths increase with the powers of 2 for each round, the total cost of rebalancing is also linear. =Pseudocode= procedure rebalance(A, begin, end) is r ‚Üê end w ‚Üê end √∑ 2 while r ‚â• begin do A[w+1] ‚Üê gap A[w] ‚Üê A[r] r ‚Üê r ‚àí 1 w ‚Üê w ‚àí 2 procedure sort(A) is n ‚Üê length(A) S ‚Üê new array of n gaps for i ‚Üê 1 to floor(log2(n) + 1) do for j ‚Üê 2^i to 2^(i + 1) do ins ‚Üê binarysearch(A[j], S, 2^(i ‚àí 1)) insert A[j] at S[ins] Here, \`binarysearch(el, A, k)\` performs binary search in the first elements of , skipping over gaps, to find a place where to locate element .

For each studied organism, a specialized habitat device is to be constructed. These include: *The Advanced Animal Habitat, for individually or group-housed rats and mice *The Plant Research Unit, housing Arabidopsis thaliana and specialised wheat *The Aquatic Habitat, for various organisms including zebrafish *The Insect Habitat, studying fruit flies *The Avian Development Facility, for research involving the eggs of Japanese quail *The Cell Culture Unit, to investigate several microorganisms, as well as to grow tissue cultures from humans, animals, and plants. Once flight-qualified, habitats (also referred to as \\"subrack payloads\\") would be carried to the Space Station aboard a Space Shuttle (housed in the Orbiter Middeck), and transferred to a specially designed Habitat Holding Rack, which would provide them with the cooling air, power, and data connections required. On-station, the habitats could also be housed in a centrifuge module that could simulate gravity with a magnitude between zero and two times that experienced on earth. When station crew needed to add or remove specimens, or perform certain other work, a habitat would be transferred to the Life Sciences Glovebox, an enclosed volume with glove inserts in the walls to allow a crew member to perform manual tasks. Data generated by the habitats would be transmitted to ground stations for analysis. To date, none of the SSBRP's payloads have been flown to the International Space Station, in part due to an interruption in Space Shuttle flights after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.

Removal of just one lobe of the lung is specifically referred to as a lobectomy, and that of a segment of the lung as a wedge resection (or segmentectomy). Indications A chest x-ray of a person who has had their right lung removed The most common reason for a pneumonectomy is to remove tumourous tissue arising from lung cancer. In the days prior to the use of antibiotics in tuberculosis treatment, tuberculosis was sometimes treated surgically by pneumonectomy. The operation will reduce the respiratory capacity of the patient; before conducting a pneumonectomy, the surgeon will evaluate the ability of the patient to function after the lung tissue is removed. After the operation, patients are often given an incentive spirometer to help exercise their remaining lung and to improve breathing function. A rib or two is sometimes removed to allow the surgeon better access to the lung. Types Diagram showing the parts removed in a pneumonectomy There are two types of pneumonectomy: #Simple pneumonectomy: removal of just the affected lung #Extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP): removal of the affected lung, plus part of the diaphragm, the parietal pleura (lining of the chest) and the pericardium (lining of the heart) on that side.

Uses In traditional forms of Wicca, such as Gardnerian or Alexandrian, Craft names are typically adopted primarily out of regard for their symbolism. Craft names may be carefully guarded and used only with members of one's own coven. Some Wiccans will use two different Craft names, one with the general public (or the Neopagan community) and one with their covenmates. Wiccans who choose to conceal their religion to avoid religious discrimination may use a craft name when speaking to the press. The use of Craft names as online handles for Neopaganism- or Wicca-related groups and discussions has become increasingly common. The use (or over-use) of \\"outer court\\" Craft names (to be used outside of initiates- only or \\"inner-court\\" settings) is the subject of some debate.

Summary  Billie Jo begins with how her father wants to have a son instead of a daughter, but how he loves her anyway, but treats her like the son he doesn‚Äôt have, rough and tough. The opening of the book also describes the dust storms causing trouble on farms, a vital part to the rural farming community, for it is a homestead area. As dust storms swoop in and steal any hope of profit from wheat, the US government makes moves to try to help the area. FDR's New Deal is a series of programs to assist farmers (along with the rest of the country). Daddy takes a loan to try and start a new bread shop, which Ma advises against, but the dust carries it away and makes more dust. One day while Billie Jo's pregnant mother is making breakfast, her father leaves a pail of kerosene next to the stove and then goes out into the fields. Her mother picks up the pail, mistakenly thinking it is water and makes \\"a rope of fire\\". Screaming to her husband, Billie Jo's mother runs out to the fields, with Billie Jo behind her. Thinking the house may catch on fire, Billie Jo runs back inside and throws the can of kerosene out the door. Unfortunately, her mother is running back to the house, and Billie Jo ends up throwing the can of kerosene onto her mother‚Äôs apron, lighting her on fire. Billie Jo runs outside and began to beat the flames on her mother with her bare hands in an attempt to save both her mother and unborn sibling. Her mother is taken inside and treated by the local doctor, but she never again looks like \\"Ma\\" to Billie Jo, for she is unrecognizable through her burns. Billie Jo's own hands are badly burned as well, swollen and dripping pus. One night, Billie Jo's father takes the money allocated to pay for his daughter's future education and gets drunk at Guymon. Billie Jo is left trying to give water (using immensely burned and swollen hands) to her burned and injured mother. A few days later, Billie Jo's mother dies while giving birth to her son. The baby is delivered and lives for a few moments, until he too is pronounced dead. Buried on top of a hill, Billie Jo names him Franklin after the president, her father at a loss for words. Billie Jo and her father begin to drift apart from each other. After the deaths, Billie Jo stops calling her father \\"Daddy.\\" Scarred and burned, Billie Jo is left unable to play piano, one of the few joys that had remained in her life (like her mother). Time goes on, and she begins to notice spots on her father's face, similar to those on her grandfather when he had skin cancer. After trying to return to her former life style, Billie Jo becomes desperate to get out of the dust, so she gets up and leaves one night with only a handful of biscuits. She hitchhikes on a train, and a homeless and smelly man comes up to her. Talking for a while, he shows her a picture of his family before she falls asleep. She awakens to find that her biscuits are gone, but the picture that the man had of his family is left in its place. It is here she learns of her sense of belonging, and it all becomes clear to her. After a week, Billie Jo returns home and convinces her father to go see a doctor. She calls him \\"Daddy\\" for the first time since the incident. The two even start to gain each other's trust again. She then meets Louise, a woman who stayed with her father while Billie was on the run. Billie Jo respects Louise because Louise knows how to cope with \\"two red heads\\" and not \\"step on the toes of a ghost\\". Billie Jo and Louise just talk, and her father eventually ends up dating Louise.

Biography Doris Treitz was born in Heydekrug, Memelland (today: ≈†ilutƒó, Lithuania). Due to the flight and expulsion of Germans during and after WWII, her mother had to take her and her two elder sisters to the West. While the father wanted his daughters to aim for office jobs, the mother supported artistic aspirations, and the interest in foreign languages. At age 17, she left school in Kiel to become a fashion designer and actor in Hamburg, studying at Margot-H√∂pfner-Schauspielschule, working in several jobs to earn the money. At age 19, Doris Treitz took part in the Miss Germany pageant, enjoying being in the spotlight while still living with her mother in a small cheap apartment in Hamburg's Rothenburgsort. In order to pay the rent, they had to lease a room to a Russian, Nikolai Nefedov, who was 49 years old and en route to emigration into the US. Doris fell in love, they married. After their boy Alexander (\\"Sascha\\") was born when she was 20, the couple got a divorce and Mr. Nefedov went to America alone. Alexandra has two grandchildren, Dennis Nefedov, born May 1, 1993, and George Nefedov, born September 23, 2008, currently living in Boston, Massachusetts. As she did not consider her legal name Doris Nefedov as helpful for a career, she chose Alexandra instead, after her son. Before a concert of singer Salvatore Adamo, the crowd booed other new female talents away, until Alexandra won them over with her rather melancholic style. Hans R. Beierlein, the well known German music manager of Udo J√ºrgens, became her manager, friend and lover. Alexandra's first hit single, Zigeunerjunge (\\"gypsy boy\\"), was released in 1967; several more releases followed, including, Schwarze Balalaika (\\"black balalaika\\") and Mein Freund, der Baum (\\"my friend, the tree\\"). Most of the songs became no big hits, according to producer Fred Weyrich because they \\"were ahead of their time\\". She was forced to record a song not written by herself, Sehnsucht (\\"yearning\\") and vowed not to sing it again, yet it became a hit.Sehnsucht reached number 12 in the German charts, Zigeunerjunge number 22. In summer 1969 her third and last hit was Erstes Morgenrot (\\"First red sunrise\\") which topped at number 17. Ehnert, G√ºnter (ed.): Hit Bilanz. Deutsche Chart Singles 1956-1980. Hamburg: Taurus Press, 1990, p. 15 In her international career, she performed songs in several other languages besides German as well, including French, English, Russian and Hebrew. In 1968, she performed in Rio de Janeiro, and spent a holiday there, meeting a new lover. In spring of 1969, she was awarded the Golden Europa award for best newcomer. Soon, she had to take a time-out in Davos due to the stress of her career which soon resumed after a move to Munich. She met Pierre Lafaire, and they intended to marry even though her sisters disagreed, suspecting fraud. They split up. Following phone calls, she slept in the same room with her son fearing that her son might get abducted, and wrote her last will in favour of her son and mother. Death On July 31, 1969, Alexandra traveled to Hamburg to negotiate with her record company. She took a car shuttle train. The same day, on her way to a holiday on Sylt, Alexandra drove her recently acquired Mercedes-Benz 220 SE Coup√© with her son, Alexander, and her mother. On the way, she had the car checked in a workshop before she failed to brake for a crossing, colliding with a truck near the town of Tellingstedt, Holstein under unexplained circumstances. Alexander survived with minor injuries, while Alexandra was killed instantly and her mother died later in hospital. The car may have had mechanical issues, and there was some speculation that the accident was sabotaged. With 3,000 people attending, Alexandra was buried at the Westfriedhof in Munich: her tombstone is simply labelled \\"Alexandra\\". A biography was published in 1999 by movie director Marc Boettcher; Boettcher received several anonymous threats while researching the circumstances of Alexandra's death, and announced that he would push for a new investigation of the circumstances of her death in 2004 after further research, citing former Stasi documents that revealed that her lover Pierre Lafaire had been an American secret agent in Denmark as well as testimonies contradicting the documented results of the original investigation.

The 2018 US News & World Report ranked both the Masters and the Doctor of Nursing Practice degree programs as #1 overall. On January 2, 1931, the school opened its doors to its first class of 24 undergraduate students under the direction of Dean Bessie Baker and instructor Ann Henshaw Gardiner. The school has offered many different degrees over the years. The first students, high school graduates, received a diploma after a three-year program that cost just $100 per year. In 1938, the school began offering baccalaureate degrees to students who had completed two years of college along with the nursing curricula. In 1944, the school began a Bachelor of Science in Nursing Education degree program. In 1953, it added a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree program. Five years later, under the leadership of Thelma Ingles, The Duke School of Nursing was one of the first schools in the nation to offer a graduate nursing program. In 1984, as a part of Duke University's retrenchment plan, the last class of BSN students graduated. The graduate programs also ended in 1984, re- opening in 1985 with a new curriculum and focus on research. In response to the increasing nursing shortage, the school once again began offering a BSN degree in 2002‚Äì this time as an accelerated, 16-month degree offered to students already holding an undergraduate degree. In 2006, the school accepted the first students into the new PhD program. In 2008, the school launched the first Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree program in North Carolina to prepare nurses for leadership positions in clinical care.

A typical brachycephalic molossoid type breed, the Bordeaux is a very powerful dog, with a very muscular body. This brawny breed has been put to work in many different capacities, from pulling carts and hauling heavy objects, to guarding flocks and, historically, the castles of the European elite. History Dogue de Bordeaux CH \\"Sans-Peur\\", 1900. Sculpture of a Dogue de Bordeaux in the act of wolf-baiting from the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle The Dogue de Bordeaux was known in France as early as the fourteenth century, particularly in southern France in the region around Bordeaux. Hence, the city lent its name to this large dog. The breed was first exhibited in France in 1863 after which time it gained in popularity not only in their home country but in other parts of the world. The first record of Dogue de Bordeaux in the UK can be seen in the Kennel Club Gazette in 1897. The breed was officially recognised by the Kennel Club (UK) in 1997 but it was not until 2001 that the Kennel Club (UK) accepted an interim breed standard. A uniform breed type of the Bordeaux dog did not exist before about 1920. The French placed emphasis on keeping the old breeding line pure. Black masks were considered an indication of the crossing in of the English Mastiff. As an important indication of purity of the breed, attention was paid to the self-colored (pink) nose, lighter eye color (dark amber), and red mask. They were originally bred with huge heads; a pioneer for the breed in Germany, Werner Preugschat once wrote: > What am I supposed to do with a dog that has a monstrous skull and is at > most able to carry it from the food dish to its bed? The Dogue de Bordeaux was at one time known to come in two varieties, Dogues and Doguins, the Dogue being considerably larger than the Doguin. The smaller Doguin has withered away to nothing more than a mention in breed history books, and is no longer in existence. The history of the breed is believed to predate the Bullmastiff and the Bulldog. It is said that the Dogue can be found in the background of the Bullmastiff, and others claim that the Dogue and mastiff breeds were both being accomplished at the same time. Another theory is the Dogue de Bordeaux originates from the Tibetan Mastiff and it is also said that the Dogue is related to the Greco-Roman molossoids used for war. As there was a breed similar to the Dogue de Bordeaux in Rome at the time of Julius Caesar's reign, possibly a cousin of the Neapolitan Mastiff. Others suggest that the Dogue de Bordeaux is a descendant of a breed which existed in ancient France, the Dogues de Bordeaux of Aquitaine. Whichever theory is true, the Dogue de Bordeaux shares the same common links as all modern molossers. The Dogue de Bordeaux was once classified into three varieties, the Parisian, the Toulouse and the Bordeaux, types which were bred depending on the region of France and the jobs it was required to do. The ancestral Dogue de Bordeaux had various coat colors, such as brindle and a majority of white markings that carried fully up the legs. It had scissor bites in some regions, undershot in others; a big head or a small head, a large body or a small body; very inconsistent in type. Another controversial aspect was the mask, red (brown), black or none. The Dogue de Bordeaux of Bordeaux of the time also sported cropped ears. Regardless, it had a general type similar to today's Dogue de Bordeaux. =Breeding= Dogue de Bordeaux Dogue de Bordeaux In 1863, the first canine exhibition was held at the \\"Jardin d'Acclimatation\\" in Paris, France. The winner of the Dogue de Bordeaux was a female named Magentas. The Dogue de Bordeaux was then given the name of the capital of its region of origin, today's Dogue de Bordeaux. During the 1960s, a group of breeders of the Dogue de Bordeaux in France, headed by Raymond Triquet, worked on the rebuilding of the foundation of the breed. In 1970, a new standard was written for the breed, with the most recent update in 1995. This standard is the basis of the standard written for the AKC in 2005. Although the Dogue de Bordeaux first arrived in the USA in the 1890s for the show ring, the first documented Dogues de Bordeaux of modern times appeared in 1959 by the name of Fidelle de Fenelon. Between 1969 and 1980, imported Dogues de Bordeaux in the US were scarce, limited to a few breeders who worked closely with the French Dogue de Bordeaux Club, the SADB. The breed was first \\"officially\\" introduced to American purebred enthusiasts in an article written in 1982 by the American anthropologist Dr. Carl Semencic for Dog World magazine. When Semencic's first article on the breed was published, there were no Dogues de Bordeaux in the United States. There were 600 examples left in the world, mostly in France, the Netherlands and East Berlin, and the breed's numbers were on the decline. Much later, in 1989, the typical American family saw the Dogue de Bordeaux for the first time on the big screen in Touchstone's movie Turner & Hooch about a policeman and his canine partner. Since then, the Dogue de Bordeaux has taken hold in the United States and can be found in greatly increasing numbers across the country. The Dogue de Bordeaux has been supported by multiple breed clubs throughout the years, and has finally found its way to full American Kennel Club recognition through the assistance of the Dogue de Bordeaux Society of America. Since 1997, the society has helped bring the breed to the point in which full AKC recognition could be achieved.  Appearance  Dogue de Bordeaux puppy The Dogue de Bordeaux is a well balanced, muscular and massive dog with a powerful build. The distance from the deepest point of the chest to the ground is slightly less than the depth of the chest. A massive head with proper proportions and features is an important characteristic of the breed.The breed is set somewhat low to the ground and is not tall like the English Mastiff. The body of the Dogue de Bordeaux is thick-set, with a top- line that has a slight dip (topline is never completely straight) and a gentle rounded croup. The front legs should be straight and heavy-boned, well up on pasterns, down to tight cat-like feet. The straight tail, beginning thickly at the base and then tapering to a point at the end, should not reach lower than the hocks, and is set and carried low. The breed is to be presented in a completely natural condition with intact ears, tail, and natural dewclaws. It should be evaluated equally for correctness in conformation, temperament, movement, and overall structural soundness. = Weight = The breed standards by European FCI and the AKC specify a minimum weight of for a female and for a male. There is no formally stated maximum weight, but dogs must be balanced with regard to their overall type and the conformation standards of the breed. = Height = The standard states that the desirable height, at maturity, should range between for male dogs and from for females. Deviation from these margins is considered a fault. = Head = Stenotic nares (pinched nostrils) may cause breathing problems. The massive head is a crucial breed characteristic. The Dogue de Bordeaux is claimed to have the largest head in the canine world, in proportion to the rest of the body. For males, the circumference of the head, measured at the widest point of the skull, is roughly equal to the dog's height at the withers (shoulders). For females, the circumference may be slightly less. When viewed from the front or from above, the head of the Dogue forms a trapezoid shape with the longer top-line of the skull, and the shorter line of the underjaw, forming the parallel sides of the trapezoid. The jaw is undershot and powerful. The Dogue should always have a black or red mask that can be distinguished from the rest of the coat around and under the nose, including the lips and eye rims. The nose color in red- masked dogs should be brown, in black-masked dogs, it must be black. The muzzle should be at most a third of the total length of the head and no shorter than a quarter of the length of the head, the ideal being between the two extremes. The upper lip hangs thickly down over the lower jaw. The upper lips of the Dogue de Bordeaux hangs over the lower lips. The skin on the neck is loose, forming a noticeable dewlap, but should not resemble that of a Neapolitan Mastiff. Small pendant ears top the head, but should not be long and hound like. = Coat = Female with black mask The standard specifies the coat to be 'short, fine, and soft to the touch'. Color varies from shades of fawn (light, coppery red) to mahogany (dark, brownish red) with a black, brown, or red mask, although the red mask is true to the breed. White markings are permitted on the tips of the toes and on the chest, but white on any other part of the body is considered a fault, and a disqualifying one if the pigmentation goes beyond the neck. Health A young Dogue de Bordeaux Dogue de Bordeaux in the snow While larger breeds of canines tend to have shorter life expectancy, the life expectancy of the Dogue is still shorter than even breeds of comparable or larger size. According to data collected by the Dogue De Bordeaux Society of America, the average lifespan of the breed is 5 to 6 years. A veterinary database in the UK showed similar figures. \\"n=21; median=5.5 years; IQR 3.3-6.1; range=0.0-8.8\\" In the American survey, the oldest dog in the record was 12 years old. The Society is actively recording dogs that are 7 years old or older to celebrate the longer-lived dogs. Because of its brachycephalic head, the Dogue can be affected by breathing problems. Some may be intolerant of heat or exercise as a result. The FCI standard considers excessive shortness of breath and raspy breathing in the Dogue a severe fault. The brachycephalic head shape can also encourage ectropion‚Äîan outward rolling of the lower eyelid‚Äî which can lead to conjunctivitis (eye inflammation) and bacterial infections. Under the UK Kennel Club's Breed Watch system, the Dogue is classed as a Category 3 breed (formerly High Profile Breed), meaning it is a breed \\"where some dogs have visible conditions or exaggerations that can cause pain or discomfort.\\" Aortic stenosis is a disease of the heart valve in which the opening of the aortic valve is narrowed. Symptoms include exercise intolerance, exertional syncope (fainting from physical exertion) and sudden death. One study suggests a high predisposition in the breed. No severe cases were found in adult dogs, and most moderate to severely affected dogs died before one year of age, leading the authors to speculate that the disease is more severe in the Dogue than in other breeds. Another heart problem in the breed is dilated cardiomyopathy, a condition in which the heart becomes weakened and enlarged and cannot pump blood efficiently. Some affected dogs may die suddenly without showing any signs of problems. Others may die from congestive heart failure after several weeks or months. Affected dogs are often euthanized at an early stage to avoid suffering. An estimated 5% of dogs may be affected by footpad hyperkeratosis, a thickening of the footpad and sometimes nose. Lesions usually occur at the age of 6 months. X-rays submitted voluntarily to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals shows that more than 50% of Dogues in the database are affected by hip dysplasia. Over 21% are affected by elbow dysplasia. Approximately 3% of Dogues suffer from retinal dysplasia. Patella luxation affects around 2% of Dogues. =Reproduction= Data from the Norwegian Kennel Club indicates a mean litter size of 8.1 puppies (ranging from 2-17) for the breed. The breed has a high stillborn and early neonatal mortality rate, with a stillborn rate of 14.2% and early neonatal mortality (death within 1 week from birth) of 10.4%. The average across all breeds in the study was 4.3% stillbirth and 3.7% early neonatal mortality. Excluding stillborn and early deaths, the mean litter size is 6.1. UK Kennel Club data shows that 27.8% (5 of 18) of Dogue litters were delivered by caesarean section. References Further reading *Dogue de Bordeaux, Janish, Joseph.

He also owned a private observatory. He began teaching theoretical astronomy and geodesics at the University of Vienna in 1866. By 1875 he was appointed a professor. In 1873 he became the director of the Austrian Geodetic Survey, and in 1886 he was elected president of the International Geodetic Association. He was considered a highly capable astronomer and mathematician. For example, he was reputed to have memorized the values of 14,000 logarithms. In 1868 he led an expedition to observe a solar eclipse.

Its members included Billy Connolly, who later became a renowned stand-up comedian and actor; guitarist Tam Harvey; and the singer-songwriter Gerry Rafferty. The band was active from 1965 to 1971. Career Connolly co-founded the band with Tam Harvey in 1965 and played in the pubs and clubs around Glasgow, Scotland, most notably the Old Scotia Bar. Connolly sang, played banjo and guitar, and entertained the audience with his humorous introductions to the songs. Harvey was an accomplished bluegrass guitarist. Rafferty joined later and for a short time they performed as a trio. However, the nature of the act had changed and Harvey departed shortly afterwards. The remaining duo broke up in the early 1970s after recording two albums of material: The New Humblebums and Open Up the Door, the former graced by a cover by John \\"Patrick\\" Byrne, marking the beginning of a long working relationship between Byrne and Rafferty.

McQuade also seems to like Sally's boyfriend Bobby, who is enlisted in the US Army and is respectful of McQuade being a retired Marine. While out horseback riding with his daughter, his daughter's horse runs wild and she is saved by Lola Richardson (Carrera). She invites them to a party where Rawley Wilkes (Carradine) displays his prowess in martial arts and some of his thugs get into a fight with Ramos. After settling the fight, Richardson and McQuade leave the party and apparently have a romantic encounter. She shows up at his house and cleans it. Despite McQuade's annoyance that he does not need a woman to take care of him, Richardson seems to start breaking through his rough exterior within the couple of days they are together. Meanwhile, Sally and Bobby witness the hijacking of a U.S. Army convoy. Bobby is shot and killed by the hijackers, who then cause Sally to be hospitalized when they shove her car into a ravine. McQuade more readily works with Kayo to find out who did this to his daughter and her boyfriend. Kayo's computer skills allow him to track the errant convoy. At an illegal garment factory, they pick up a young delinquent named Snow (William Sanderson), who is reluctant to talk until Dakota points a Mac-10 in his general direction and empties the magazine. In retaliation for disrupting his operations, Wilkes asphyxiates Dakota in his house and also has Snow killed. Dakota's murder attracts the attention of FBI Special Agent Jackson (Kennedy) who works with Ramos and McQuade. The trail leads them to Wilkes, revealed as an arms merchant who is hijacking U.S. arms shipments for his illicit weapons deals. The three eventually find the arms trading headquarters in the desert. Agents Burnside and N√∫√±ez are killed when they attack the headquarters. McQuade and Ramos had tried to stop them, but ended up in the gunfight as well. McQuade is caught and sadistically beaten by Wilkes, who then orders that McQuade be placed in his truck and buried under a truckload of dirt, ignoring Richardson's pleas for mercy for the three men. After regaining consciousness in his truck (a Dodge Ramcharger, 1983 model), McQuade produces a beer and pours it over his face. Then, using his homemade supercharger system, McQuade charges his truck through the dirt - miraculously breaking himself free - and then rescues Ramos and Jackson. All three men are weakened due to being shot and beaten. McQuade finds that Sally has been taken by Wilkes to Mexico. A rival arms dealer known as Falcon, who has been disguising his illegal business as a pinball machine dealer supplies McQuade with this intelligence, claiming Wilkes has double-crossed him and he would like his competition eliminated. Falcon gives McQuade the exact location in Mexico where Wilkes and his daughter are. Though McQuade is intent and tries to head to the location on his own, both Ramos and Jackson have followed him and the three head into the base for the attack. After an intense battle, with Jackson being shot again, and Sally and Richardson escaping, Sally is shot in the leg and both women are sidelined. Finally McQuade and Wilkes engage a hand-to-hand fight with the fight leaning in Wilkes' favor, until he strikes Sally (who ran to her father's aid), provoking McQuade into a frenzy of hits and kicks that defeats Wilkes. McQuade is reunited with his daughter, only to be fired upon by an injured Wilkes. Richardson steps into the line of fire to save McQuade and is fatally wounded. Her dying words to McQuade are that Wilkes killed her husband, forced her to be his arm candy, and that she loved McQuade. Meanwhile, Wilkes and his remaining thug run into a building. Jackson provides McQuade with a grenade, and McQuade throws it into the building, killing Wilkes and the other man. Falcon then arrives in his helicopter. McQuade, Sally, Ramos, and Jackson take it, leaving Falcon to deal with the Mexican \\"federales\\". McQuade's ex-wife and daughter are at a ceremony where McQuade's commander presents him (as well as Ramos and Jackson) with the Texas Award of Valor, and McQuade congratulates his ex-wife for getting an excellent job in New Mexico. The following day, McQuade has rented a U-Haul and is helping Sally and his ex-wife move. As they are getting ready to leave, Ramos shows up telling McQuade he is needed as a gunman has held up a bank. Figuring he has had enough adventure and wanting to spend more time with his family, McQuade politely declines. However, when Ramos also warns that the robber has taken hostages, McQuade is spurred into action. As the squad car speeds off, his ex-wife bellows \\"J.J.

Kaye Dyal wrote the script with BJ Nelson. It was originally called Lone Wolf Gonzaullas and was about a real Texas Ranger who usually worked alone, Manuel T. Gonzaullas. Dyal was friends with Carver and showed him the script. Carver thought Chuck Norris would be ideal to play the lead so he approached him to do the film. Carver wanted to \\"mess up\\" Chuck Norris' image, having him grow a beard and drink beer on screen. Norris was reluctant as he wanted to be a good role model for children. Carver thought the screenplay had a novel idea but it \\"was a very by the numbers script, it had a lot of problems, not just story wise but technically.\\" He was friends and \\"shooting buddies\\" with John Milius and asked him to contribute some ideas, including advice on the guns the character used. In particular, Orion (who were financing the film) were unhappy with the opening sequence so Carver asked Milius to rewrite it. Milius did this, as well as providing input on guns in the script. Carver says Milius \\"was great to work with\\" but \\"didn't want credit\\". Carver was a fan of director Sergio Leone and had met him. He decided to make the film in the style of Leone. Carver says the film was turned down by every studio, including Orion. He says Orion only agreed to finance the film because another project fell over. =Shooting= Chuck Norris and David Carradine refused to use stunt doubles for their climactic fight scene, despite strong reservations from the producers. \\"The thing about the fight with Dave is that not only is it very well done, but it and the other martial-arts scenes are not just fillers,\\" said Norris. \\"You've got to have more than technique if you're going to capture the emotions of the audience.\\" Carradine said Norris wanted to do a fight that matched the one Norris did with Bruce Lee in the Roman Coliseum in Way of the Dragon \\"and we were actually trying to go beyond that. I think we did. I think photographically we didn‚Äôt. But as far as the fight was concerned, the combination of the two styles, you know, because I was very flowing and loose, and he was very solid and hard, I think we accomplished what we set out to do.\\" Carradine said the fight was shot over four days and \\"we were little old men by the end of it. All our old injuries came back, we got new injuries, and we were stumbling around like little old men.\\" Carradine said Steve Carver was \\"probably the best director Chuck has ever had\\" adding that: > Chuck had a feeling when I was working with him, that he wanted to be a > better actor. At one point, when we were working on the fight, I got close > to him, and I said. This is really right man, puttin' your face in the > dirt.‚Äô And he looked at me, you know, and he didn‚Äôt expect that from me. And > we got to be buddies. For just that period. I don‚Äôt hang around with Chuck. > Chuck mainly doesn‚Äôt like to work with co-stars. His movies are all solo > movies. Release The film was originally rated \\"R\\" but Chuck Norris appealed the decision to the MPAA and succeeded in getting the film rated PG. \\"This is the second time I've appealed,\\" said Norris. \\"They gave Good Guys Wear Black an R, but I persuaded them to make it a PG. My argument was the strong, positive image I project on the screen. The word karate, unfortunately, connotes violence to many people. Actually, it's a means of avoiding violent situations, and a form of defense if you have no choice and you're backed into a corner.... My films are very similar to the John Wayne movies of the '40s. He'd go in a bar and Jack Palance would pick a fight with him, and then Wayne would take out half the saloon. It's the same theme: A man is pushed into a situation where he has to resort to violence.\\" Reception Roger Ebert rated the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and compared Norris and his character favorably to the roles Clint Eastwood used to play in spaghetti Westerns. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called Norris \\"good\\" and further noted: \\"The plot, set in and around El Paso, is unimportant and nonstop, like an old-fashioned, Saturday afternoon serial, which isn't at all bad. Steve Carver, the director, understands that in such films action is content.\\" Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote, \\"Fans of Soldier of Fortune magazine will think they've been ambushed and blown away to heaven by 'Lone Wolf McQuade.' Every conceivable type of portable weapon on the world market today is tried out by the macho warriors on both sides of the law in this modern western, which pits Texas Ranger Chuck Norris and his cohorts against multifarious baddies who like to play rough.\\"McCarthy, Todd (April 13, 1983). \\"Film Reviews: Lone Wolf McQuade\\". Variety. 18. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two- and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \\"The rhythm here is seven minutes of action, followed by a minute of dialogue, followed by another seven minutes of action. For a while I was laughing at all of the explosions; eventually, though, all of the noise became annoying.\\"Siskel, Gene (April 15, 1983). \\"Violent 'Wolf McQuade' merely blows itself to bits\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 3, p. 3. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times thought that the film, \\"like its predecessor, 'Forced Vengeance,' becomes so numbingly violent that it's a turnoff about a third of the way through.\\"Thomas, Kevin (April 14, 1983). \\"Another Chuck Norris Karate-Rama\\". Los Angeles Times. Part VI, p. 4. Jimmy Summers wrote in BoxOffice magazine, \\"Chuck Norris still doesn't have the screen presence to achieve his often-repeated wish of becoming the next John Wayne, but as long as he keeps his feet and fists flying and stays relatively quiet he's an effective action hero. In the wildly exaggerated world of this movie, he's almost a super-hero.\\"Summers, Jimmy (June 1983). \\"Lone Wolf McQuade\\". BoxOffice. 48. As of December 2019 the film has a score of 57% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 7 reviews. =Box office= Lone Wolf McQuade grossed $12 million in USA. Legacy Norris later said the film \\"broke the kung fu mode\\" for him and helped turn him into a more mainstream action star. Norris credits this film as a leading inspiration for his hit television series, Walker, Texas Ranger, which premiered a decade later. Yet the pilot had to be rewritten, and the characters' names changed, since \\"all things McQuade\\" were copyrighted by Orion Pictures. The original co-producer of the series was The Cannon Group, which like Orion is now absorbed into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (though the Cannon films are distributed on television by another company).

Following electrification between June 2013 and May 2014, Cumbernauld services became an extension of the North Clyde Line's Springburn Branch. Services from Cumbernauld arrived at Glasgow Queen Street Low Level platforms, freeing up capacity in the High Level station. Due to cancellation of the Garngad Chord, trains must reverse from Springburn. As of 2019, the existing Falkirk Grahamston service has been extended through to Edinburgh Waverley. All services to Cumbernauld have also been extended with services now departing from Glasgow Queen Street High Level instead of Low Level. All services now use Class 385 EMUs instead of diesel units. Future developments Upon completion of the Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvement Programme, a series of Diversionary Route electrification projects have been outlined for completion in 2018. These plans include full electrification between Cumbernauld and Falkirk Grahamston. With the cancellation of the Garngad Chord in November 2011, the potential to remove the timely reversing procedure at Springburn is still an option. There are also tentative plans to extend passenger services from Falkirk to Grangemouth, a town which lost its train service in January 1968. This is an idea put forward by Network Rail to improve freight access and is supported by Falkirk Council, who are currently undertaking a feasibility study into the project's potential.

The storyline is a complicated, multi-layered crossover regarding the return of the seven-headed Elder God Set the Old Serpent at the hands of the various underwater empires of the Marvel Universe. The title is misleading, however, as Atlantis and its then-leader Attuma only play minor roles in the story as flunkies for the real masterminds: the Lemurians and their leader Llyra. There is also a five-issue Atlantis Attacks miniseries in 2020 with a different plot. Publication history Atlantis Attacks continued and expanded the format created by 1988's The Evolutionary War crossover storyline, in which all of Marvel's superhero annuals were tied into one story. However, where \\"The Evolutionary War\\" had had 11 parts, Atlantis Attacks had 14, as Marvel revived the annual format for Daredevil, Iron Man, and Thor (which were not given annuals in 1988) as part of the storyline. The Daredevil Annual is mistakenly numbered \\"4\\", the same as the previous annual in the series. In an effort to minimize the resulting confusion, this annual is often numbered \\"4b\\" in price guides and retailer listings. Also, unlike The Evolutionary War annuals, which were mainly standalone stories loosely connected by the presence of the High Evolutionary, Atlantis Attacks was a true serial, with many of the annuals ending on cliffhangers that would be resolved in the next installment. Every annual also contained a back-up story called \\"The Serpent Crown Saga\\", written by Peter Sanderson with pencil art by Mark Bagley. This 14-part story explained the complicated history of the Serpent Crown and recounted all its previous appearances for new readers. Plot The disembodied Ghaur baits the Silver Surfer into restoring his physical form by hijacking the Surfer's surfboard. After a brief battle, Ghaur escapes and flees to Earth, where he convinces Lemuria's ruler, Llyra, to form an alliance to summon Set back to Earth. Ghaur's plan for the serpent god's return is a fivefold plot: 1\\\\. Build a brand new, giant-sized Serpent Crown, via gathering a large amounts of mystic artifacts and melting them down into building material for the new Serpent Crown. 2\\\\. Forge an alliance with Attuma, ruler of Atlantis, and convince him to declare war on the surface world as a means to render Atlantis defenseless (due to Attuma devoting all of the city's military resources towards a surface world invasion), so that Ghaur and Llyra's forces could launch a massive military assault on Atlantis, slaughtering thousands of innocent civilians as a sacrificial offering to Set. 3\\\\. Transform the human population into mute serpent men; using a serpent formula conceived by the terrorist known as the Viper, with the deposed underground tyrant Tyrannus injecting recovering drug addicts with the chemical. 4\\\\. Kidnap seven super-powered heroines for the purpose of becoming brides for Set, ultimately for the purpose of becoming pregnant with the seven-headed serpent god's children. 5\\\\. Use the super-heroine Dagger (one of the women selected as a bride for Set) and a special magical magnifying glass to magnify the potency of a portion of Set's life-force into a viable amount of life energy, to give life to the giant Serpent Crown, allowing Set's exiled essence to possess the now-mindless seven-headed serpent body and return to Earth. However, their plans are countered at just about every turn by Earth's heroes, culminating with the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, and Namor the Sub- Mariner (who is believed dead for the bulk of the storyline during a skirmish with Iron Man and Attuma's military forces) defeating Ghaur and Llyra and stopping them from bringing Set to Earth.

(vol. 2) #25 (May 1991), by Jim Valentino and Rik Levins, explored the question \\"What if the Marvel Super Heroes had lost Atlantis Attacks?\\" (interior title \\"What if Set Had Come to Earth?\\"). In the story, only a handful of Earth's heroes (as well as villains Doctor Doom and Sabretooth) have avoided being turned into serpent men. After they dispatch numerous transformed former allies, they are massacred by Set and his brainwashed brides, who Set has impregnated with his evil spawn. Only the Silver Surfer and Quasar survive, and with the help of Thor (who is horribly burned and placed in stasis to keep him alive), they destroy two of Set's heads before Quasar, backed by the power of Captain Universe, sacrifices his life to exile himself and Set inside Doctor Strange's Eye of Agamotto. The Silver Surfer gives the Eye to the Watcher for safe keeping, as Set's children are born; they then consume their brainwashed mothers and countless mindless serpent men and women before leaving to terrorize alternate universes. Atlantis Attacks (2020) 30 years after the crossover event, the title would be revived as a five-issue limited series, written by Greg Pak with art by Ario Andito. The new storyline pitted the Agents of Atlas against Namor the Sub-Mariner.https://www.newsarama.com/47446-marvel-s-revives-atlantis-attacks- for-30th-anniversary-event.html After discovering that the Big Nguyen Company has stolen Atlantis' sacred guardian dragon and are using her magic to power the portal city of Pan, an enraged Namor attacks the city, only to be thwarted by the New Agents of Atlas, Pan's protectors. After Brawn tells him that immediately releasing the dragon would disrupt the portals holding the city together, Namor gives the team one day to return the dragon or else face the wrath of Atlantis.Atlantis Attacks (vol. 1) #1 While most of the Agents of Atlas work to bolster Pan's defenses and to free the dragon without disrupting Pan's portals, Atlas' leader Jimmy Woo sends Namora, Venus, Aero and Wave to Atlantis for a diplomatic mission. Wary of Namora's familial ties with Namor, Brawn discretely orders Shang-Chi and Sword Master to tail her. Upon arrival, Wave is warmly greeted by Namor due to her recent role in defeating the Sirenas, longtime enemies of Atlantis. Wave and Aero explain they only defeated a villainous faction of the Sirenas, but their words fall on deaf ears when Atlantis' citizens come out to celebrate Wave's arrival. Brawn, Uranian, 3-D Man and M-11 eventually find a way to replicate the dragon's magical energy to power Pan's portals, and the dragon is safely freed from captivity. However, when the dragon arrives back home she unexpectedly goes berserk and begins attacking the underwater kingdom. After the dragon is subdued, Atlantis' scientists discover the source of the dragon's behavior to be an implant embedded in her scales. Namor accuses Brawn to be behind the deception and immediately flies to Pan for revenge. Namor violently ambushes Brawn and proceeds to attack the Big Nguyen Company's CEO and Pan's founder Mike Nguyen in his personal tower, but is stopped by the combined efforts of the Pan Guard and Brawn, who sends Namor flying back into the ocean. While the rest of the Atlas agents prepare themselves for another attack from Namor, Nguyen reveals that he's also recruited the Sirenas to help defend Pan from Atlantis.Atlantis Attacks (vol. 1) #2 With help from the Sirenas, Namor is eventually overpowered and imprisoned. During a meeting between the Agents of Atlas, the Pan Guard and the Sirenas, a disagreement erupts when Nguyen and the Sirenas' leader Sea Hunter propose to launch a retaliatory attack Atlantis. Namora accuses the Sirenas of treachery, revealing the dragon's implant to be made from Sirena tech. After Namora and Carina of the Sirenas recount their people's history, the group finds itself torn between protecting Pan, attacking or defending Atlantis.

ID proteins also contain the HLH-dimerization domain but lack the basic DNA- binding domain and thus regulate bHLH transcription factors when they heterodimerize with bHLH proteins. The first helix-loop-helix proteins identified were named E-proteins because they bind to Ephrussi-box (E-box) sequences. In normal development, E proteins form dimers with other bHLH transcription factors, allowing transcription to occur. However, in cancerous phenotypes, ID proteins can regulate transcription by binding E proteins, so no dimers can be formed and transcription is inactive. E proteins are members of the class I bHLH family and form dimers with bHLH proteins from class II to regulate transcription. Four ID proteins exist in humans: ID1, ID2, ID3, and ID4. The ID homologue gene in Drosophila is called extramacrochaetae (EMC) and encodes a transcription factor of the helix-loop-helix family that lacks a DNA binding domain. EMC regulates cell proliferation, formation of organs like the midgut, and wing development. ID proteins could be potential targets for systemic cancer therapies without inhibiting the functioning of most normal cells because they are highly expressed in embryonic stem cells, but not in differentiated adult cells. Evidence suggests that ID proteins are overexpressed in many types of cancer. For example, ID1 is overexpressed in pancreatic, breast, and prostate cancers. ID2 is upregulated in neuroblastoma, Ewing‚Äôs sarcoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.  Function  ID proteins are key regulators of development where they function to prevent premature differentiation of stem cells. By inhibiting the formation of E-protein dimers that promote differentiation, ID proteins can regulate the timing of differentiation of stem cells during development. An increase in ID expression is seen in embryonic and adult stem cells. ID proteins also promote cell cycle progression, delaying senescence, and help facilitate cell migration. In contrast, inappropriate regulation of ID proteins in differentiated cells can contribute to tumorigenesis. Generally, IDs function as oncogenes. When ID proteins are overexpressed, cell proliferation is enhanced and cells become insensitive to growth factor depletion. Expression of ID proteins in neurons halts neuron axon growth and allows elongation of neurons. There is some controversy surrounding the ID proteins and their role in cancer, but overexpression is seen in most tumor types. There are a few exceptions, for example, an increase in ID1 expression in brain cancer is correlated with a better prognosis, while a decrease in ID4 expression in colon and rectal cancers is linked to a poorer prognosis. ID proteins can bind E-proteins, preventing them from binding bHLH proteins and halting transcription, a case often seen in cancerous phenotypes.  Subtypes  Humans express four types of Id proteins (called ID1, ID2, ID3, and ID4). A recent publication in Cancer Research (August 2010) has shown that ID1 can be used to mark endothelial progenitor cells which are critical to tumour growth and angiogenesis. This publication has demonstrated that targeting ID1 resulted in decreased tumour growth. Therefore, ID1 could be used to design a novel cancer therapy. Perk, Iavarone, and Benezra, (2005), reviewed fifteen studies and compiled a list of the phenotypic effects of each ID gene when knocked out in mice. When ID1 was knocked out, a defect in T-cell migration was seen. A knockout of ID2 showed that 25% of mice died perinatally, and those born lacked lymph nodes and showed defects in mammary proliferation. Generally, normal development was seen in mice with an ID3 knockout, but they did have a defect in B-cell proliferation. Neural defects and premature differentiation were seen in mice lacking ID4. Knockout of both ID1 and ID3 resulted in embryonic lethality due to brain hemorrhages and abnormalities in cardiac development.

Biography Parton was born in Canterbury, England, in 1822. He was taken to the United States when he was five years old, studied in New York City and White Plains, New York, and was a schoolmaster in Philadelphia and then in New York. He moved to Newburyport, Massachusetts, where he died on October 17, 1891. Parton was the most popular biographer of his day in America. Parton's nonfiction combined elements of novel writing, which made his books quite popular.

Objective The Insect Habitat would enable studies of the fruit fly to learn how microgravity affects development, nervous system function, movement and behavior, growth, reproduction, aging, gene expression, mutagenesis from radiation and circadian rhythms or sleep/wake cycles. The habitat would have housed eighty-five separate colonies of fruit flies. Each of these was divided into two compartments, separated by a rotating food cartridge. Fruit flies, which have a short life cycle, tend to lay their eggs in their food supply, to provide their offspring with a source of nourishment after hatching. After the eggs were laid, the food cartridge would be rotated, segregating the generations of flies so they could be studied separately. Multigenerartional studies were possible in this way, if each generation was removed from the colony before its offspring's eggs were ready to be segregated.

The film received generally negative reviews from critics and was a box office flop. Plot Gil Renard is a troubled baseball fan whose favorite team, the San Francisco Giants, have just signed a $40 million contract with his favorite player, Bobby Rayburn. His ex-wife Ellen obtains a restraining order to keep him away from herself and their son after Gil left his son to attend a sales meeting, but finds his client is at a baseball game. Gil is fired from his job as a knife salesman when he threatens a prospective customer. Gil begins harboring an obsession with Rayburn. When Rayburn suffers a chest injury that causes fans to be upset by his under performance, Gil shows aggression to fans that jeer him. Rayburn has also been in an open conflict with teammate Juan Primo due to both men using jersey number 11, and neither wanting to give it up, due to their long histories and connections to the number. Rayburn was instead given number 33, and harshly protested it. This culminates in a fight in the restroom of a bar. So Gil, thinking that Primo is to blame for Rayburn's performance, confronts him in a hotel sauna in an attempt to persuade him to let Rayburn have the number. Primo reveals his shoulder, branded with the number 11, and says that it is his number. This eventually leads to a struggle, and Gil stabs Primo to death. Although Rayburn is suspected of the murder, his performance improves, and Gil believes that what he did was good for Rayburn and the team. After feeling guilty about Primo's death, Rayburn starts playing well again. Thinking that Rayburn does not acknowledge his fans, Gil goes to Rayburn's beach house and saves his son Sean from drowning. Gil persuades Rayburn to play a friendly game of catch on the beach. Rayburn says he stopped caring about the game after Primo's death, because he felt there were more important things in life. He makes the mistake of telling Gil that he has lost respect for the fans, remarking on their fickle nature -- when he's hitting, they love him, but when he's not, they hate him. An angered Gil almost hits Rayburn with a fastball and launches into a diatribe. Rayburn is disturbed, especially when Gil takes off his jacket to reveal Rayburn's uniform underneath and wonders if Rayburn is happy that Primo's not around. Rayburn soon discovers that Gil has kidnapped Sean and left piece of Primo's branded shoulder in the freezer. Disillusioned with Rayburn's disrespect towards the fans, Gil spirals further into insanity and acts as though Sean is his own son. He drives to see an old friend, Coop, a catcher that Gil spoke often of playing baseball with in his past. Coop tries to help Sean escape, and reveals that the only time he and Gil ever played together was in the Little League. Gil then beats Coop to death with a baseball bat and takes Sean to a baseball field, hiding him there. Gil contacts Rayburn to make one demand: hit a home run in the upcoming game and dedicate it to Gil, or he will kill his son. With the police on high alert, Gil enters Candlestick Park in the midst of an on-and-off thunderstorm. Rayburn struggles with his emotions while at bat. After several pitches, he finally hits the ball deep into the outfield but not over the fence. Rayburn attempts to score an inside-the-park home run. He is called out, even though he is obviously safe. Rayburn argues with the umpire, who turns out to be Gil in disguise. Rayburn knocks Gil to the ground. Dozens of cops and Giants players swarm onto the field and confront Gil. Before the cops arrive, Gil kills another player, Lanz, who tries to tackle him. Despite warnings from the police, Gil goes into an exaggerated pitching motion with a knife in hand. He asks Rayburn if he cares about baseball, then assumes that he cares \\"just a little bit.\\" Gil is shot dead as he is about to throw the knife. Police discover Sean at the Little League field, where Gil once played in his childhood. They uncover his obsession with Rayburn, as hundreds of newspaper clippings adorn the deranged fan's hideout. A picture on the wall shows Gil in his past glory, playing Little League baseball and winning a game.

The group is noted for their distinct vocal harmony sound, guitar-led mbaqanga music, and fast stage dancing. Bopape was a talent scout and producer at the independent Gallo Africa's subsidiary dedicated to black music, Mavuthela Music Company. He formed the Mahotella Queens as the company's resident girl group and the ensemble, often led by the deep-voiced male vocals of Simon 'Mahlathini' Nkabinde, went on to have many hit records during the 1960s. The Queens line-up during this period usually comprised Hilda Tloubatla, Juliet Mazamisa, Ethel Mngomezulu, Nobesuthu Mbadu and Mildred Mangxola. The Queens and Mahlathini were backed by Mavuthela's house band, the Makgona Tsohle Band (including Marks Mankwane on lead guitar and West Nkosi on alto saxophone). In 1972 the line-up of the Mahotella Queens disintegrated after royalty disagreements with Bopape; Mahlathini left the company in a similar dispute with the producer. However, with a change of membership, the Queens remained productive and popular into the 1970s and 1980s. In 1987, following the explosion of interest in South African music, the Queens line-up was rejigged and three of its original singers ‚Äì Hilda Tloubatla, Nobesuthu Mbadu and Mildred Mangxola ‚Äì returned to the group. In combination with Mahlathini, the group forged a successful international touring career that lasts to this day. In spite of the deaths of Mahlathini, Marks Mankwane and West Nkosi during the late 1990s, the Mahotella Queens continue to perform and record in the 21st century. In 2013, long-serving member Mildred Mangxola retired from the group. She was replaced by a new recruit, Amanda Nkosi. History =1964 ‚Äì 1972= Initially, Rupert Bopape formed a team of female singers that would record songs under various group pseudonyms.Meintjes, L: \\"Sound of Africa: Making Music Zulu in a South African Studio\\". Duke University Press, 2003. Some of the most successful early recordings had been issued with the same name, Mahotella Queens, and it was this name that became the most recognisable to listeners. The line-up of the group would consist of five singers taken from a larger pool of vocalists that included Hilda Tloubatla, Juliet Mazamisa, Ethel and Francisca Mngomezulu, Mildred Mangxola, Nobesuthu Mbadu, Windy Sibeko, Mary Rabotapi (formerly of vocal group The Skylarks) and Nunu Maseko. The music produced by the combination of Mahlathini, the Mahotella Queens and the Makgona Tsohle Band developed heavily on the familiar mbaqanga sound, a type of jive music that fused traditional and modern elements together and played on electric instrumentation. Their take on this music evolved into a unique style referred to as \\"mgqashiyo\\", featuring up-tempo female harmony combined with powerful male bass vocal. Mahlathini became well known in his own right as a groaner, the name given to male lead singers with particularly deep and \\"groaning\\" vocals. The group would have hit singles throughout the 1960s, including \\"Thoko\\", \\"Sithunyiwe\\", \\"Pitsa Tse Kgolo\\", \\"Ngikhala Ngiyabaleka\\" and \\"Izulu Liyaduduma\\". Some of their most successful singles were compiled onto albums such as Meet the Mahotella Queens (their first LP), Indoda Mahlathini, Marena, Marks Umthakathi and Umculo Kawupheli. =1972 ‚Äì 1987= In 1972, Mahlathini and several of the Queens members departed the group following royalty disputes with Rupert Bopape. Many of the members joined rival groups such as Izintombi Zesi Manje Manje. Mahlathini moved to another record company where he recorded with a new group of vocalists, titled simply The Queens, and backed by a new instrumental band. Bopape worked with the members of the Makgona Tsohle Band to replace the members of the Mahotella Queens who had departed. The newer line-up consisted of Emily Zwane, Beatrice Ngcobo, Thandi Radebe, Thandi Nkosi and Caroline Kapentar. In 1972, West Nkosi was promoted by Bopape to a producing role. One of his early productions was a then-unknown choir, Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The Mahotella Queens continued to record and perform successfully throughout the 1970s, on many occasions in combination with groaner Robert 'Mbazo' Mkhize, who was also the lead vocalist of Mavuthela's successful male group Abafana Baseqhudeni. Guitarist Marks Mankwane became the producer of the Queens following the retirement of Rupert Bopape in the late 1970s. The group's material included albums like Izibani Zomgqashiyo, Tsamaya Moratuoa, Thatha Izimpahla Zakho, Ezesimanje and Tsa Lebowa. During the 1980s, the Queens' popularity dipped as a result of changing musical tastes, and mbaqanga was eventually usurped as the favoured music of the townships by styles such as soul and disco. =1987 ‚Äì 1999= In 1983, Mankwane reunited Mahlathini with five of the original Mahotella Queens for a spin-off group titled Mahlathini Nezintombi Zomgqashiyo. However, the decline of mbaqanga music meant that the project lasted only a year. Mankwane continued to produce the Mahotella Queens while Mahlathini decided to join forces with the West Nkosi-produced trio Amaswazi Emvelo, one of the only mbaqanga groups to remain well-selling and popular. During the mid-1980s, a stream of Western musical projects involving the music of South Africa helped to reestablish the original line-up of the Mahotella Queens in combination with Mahlathini. These included the seminal compilation The Indestructible Beat of Soweto and Paul Simon's Graceland album. In 1987, West Nkosi convinced Mankwane to bring the Queens under his production, and the line-up was completely reformed: the then-membership of the Queens was replaced by three singers associated with the group during its original 1960s heyday ‚Äì Hilda Tloubatla, Nobesuthu Mbadu and Mildred Mangxola. Together with Mahlathini and most of the original Makgona Tsohle Band, the Queens recorded their first album aimed at the international audience, Thokozile. It was successful enough to attract overseas promoters and the group ‚Äì now billed as Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens ‚Äì subsequently began a long international touring career, with a successful debut performance in France at the Angouleme Festival. In 1988, the group performed at the tribute concert held in recognition of Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday at London's Wembley Stadium. Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens continued to record successful albums including Paris - Soweto, Mbaqanga, Rhythm and Art, Stoki Stoki and Umuntu. In 1991, producer West Nkosi left the group to continue producing music for the South African audience. Marks Mankwane returned to producing Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens, as well as continuing to play lead guitar for the group. =1999 ‚Äì present= Due to health problems stemming from a long-standing diabetic condition, Mahlathini gave his last performance with the Mahotella Queens in 1997. The year after, former producer West Nkosi was killed in a car crash. On the day of his funeral, guitarist and producer Marks Mankwane died due to complications with sugar diabetes. Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens decided to continue in tribute to their deceased band members, recording the album Umuntu in early 1999. During the production of the album, Mahlathini's health deteriorated further. He died in July 1999 following several months of ill health. Mahotella Queens in 2017 in Madrid (Spain). After a period of mourning, the Mahotella Queens decided to return to the music industry. They recorded a new album in 2000 titled Sebai Bai, a successful release praised by the international audience and dedicated to Mahlathini, Mankwane and Nkosi. Some of the musicians joining the Queens on the new album included Victor Mkhize on lead guitar, Madoda Ntshingila on bass and Regis Gizavo on accordion. The Queens also continued to tour, with performances in the United States through 2002 and 2003. In 2004, the group released an experimental album aimed at a younger audience, Bazobuya, fusing their familiar mgqashiyo sound with modern beats. In 2005, the Queens released Reign & Shine, another album that departed from their usual sound, featuring a cappella performances backed by traditional percussionist Veli Shabangu and sporadic guitar from their backing band. Accompanied by Shabangu, the group toured the United Kingdom as the support act for Ladysmith Black Mambazo between May and June 2006. In combination with their complete backing band, the Queens also headlined WOMAD 2006 in July. In 2007, the Mahotella Queens released a gospel album titled Siyadumisa.

Discography The Mahotella Queens are prolific recording artists, dating back to the hundreds of recordings produced at Gallo-Mavuthela during their heyday in the 1960s and 1970s. The Queens remained with Gallo until 2005 when they joined an independent company led by former Gallo director Antos Stella. Despite the fact that the Queens recorded phenomenally throughout their career, only some of their older material is available to purchase. Most of the available material comprise recordings made after the late 1980s for the international audience.

He rode three winners of The Derby, and was Champion Jockey on eleven occasions. He rode the winners of 4,632 British flat races, a figure exceeded only by Sir Gordon Richards. Background Eddery's class at Oatlands Primary School in Stillorgan Eddery was born in Newbridge, County Kildare, less than 2 miles from the Curragh Racecourse Pat on the Back, biography by Claude Duval, and his birth was registered in Dublin. He was the fifth child of Jimmy Eddery, a jockey who rode Panaslipper to win the Irish Derby in 1955, and Josephine (the daughter of jockey Jack Moylan). His brother, Paul, also went on to become a jockey. He attended the Patrician Brothers' Primary School in Newbridge and when the family later moved to Blackrock, the Oatlands Primary School in Stillorgan. Riding career Since early childhood, Pat Eddery's most frequent dreams were to be the champion jockey and winning the Derby.Pat on the Back, Claude Duval Eddery began his career as an apprentice jockey in Ireland with the stable of Seamus McGrath. In 1967 he moved to England where he was apprenticed to Frenchie Nicholson and recorded his first success on Alvaro at Epsom Downs Racecourse on 24 April 1969 after riding more than one whole season without a single winner. The same horse was to give Eddery 6 wins in succession during the 1969 season. While still riding as an apprentice he won the Wokingham Handicap and the Timeform Gold Cup in 1969, the Northumberland Plate in 1970 and the Goodwood Stakes in 1971, a year in which he won the title of Champion Apprentice Jockey. Before formally out of apprenticeship, Eddery won the Ascot Gold Cup in 1972 after the disqualification of Roc Roi. Nicknamed Polyfilla in his early career, Pat was described as a seal in water on horseback in for a long swim. Throughout his riding career he clinched 11 championship titles, two batches coming in four consecutive seasons (1974‚Äì1977; 1988‚Äì1991). But for his joining the Vincent O'Brien stable in autumn 1980 that took him out of all main Saturday meetings in England, he would certainly have recorded more champion titles, though he did became the Irish Champion in 1982. His last champion title in 1996 was his determination to regain what he had lost when the English racing season switched over in the early 1990s to multi-purpose track racing starting in November, a time when Eddery was customarily riding for other overseas retainers since the early 1970s. Eddery's first championship title in 1974 saw the youngest English flat racing champion emerging after World War II, a record not since broken by subsequent champions. He was also first voted the Jockey of the Year in 1974 by the Horserace Writers' Association. He finished his retainer with Peter Walwyn in 1980 after two seasons of aquine virus acutely affecting the Walwyn stables. He then joined forces with the greatest racing conglomerate of that time ‚Äì the Ballydoyle stables under Irish compatriot Vincent O'Brien. When in the mid-1980s the Arab owners began to dominate the British racing scene, Eddery was retained globally by the owner of Juddmonte stables, Arab prince Khalid Abdullah, a position he held until 1994, after which he rode as freelance jockey until his retirement from the saddle at the end of 2003. Eddery's riding style was not elegant by normal standards, owing to his habit of bouncing up and down in the saddle as he urged his mounts on at the final finishes, but was undeniably effective. Frenchie Nicholson said that he regretted the fact that his protegee abandoned the \\"quiet, refined\\" style he had been taught but admitted that the young jockey stood out as being \\"in total harmony\\" with the horses he rode. Eddery rode for the Newmarket trainer Geoffrey Barling in 1972 before taking over as the stable jockey for Peter Walwyn later that year. For Walwyn he won his first two classic races on Polygamy and Grundy and was Champion Jockey in four consecutive seasons from 1974 to 1977. While under retainer with Walwyn, he clinched his first title at the record young age of 22. In 1975 he rode Grundy to victory over Bustino for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot Racecourse in what became known as Britain's \\"Race of the Century\\". Well known for riding champion horses like Sadler's Wells, Danehill (the grand sires on the sire and dam side of Frankel), etc., Eddery was also famed for riding for big owners as well as champion trainers. Apart from the later illustrious associations with Robert Sangster, Arab giant owners Prince Khalid bin Abdullah, Wafic Sa√Ød and Maktoum al-Maktoum, he rode to winners in the then Colony of Hong Kong on the first ever race horse to be owned by tycoon Li Ka Shing, called 'Golden Victory' and trained by English trainer John Brown to whom Eddery rode for many seasons in winter in Hong Kong since 10 November 1973.http://www.discuss.com.hk/viewthread.php?tid=10012378 In the following decade, Eddery became associated with the Irish Ballydoyle stable of Vincent O'Brien and gained further classic success on Kings Lake, Lomond, Golden Fleece, Assert and El Gran Senor. In 1986, on the choice of the horse's owner, he took over from Greville Starkey as the rider of Dancing Brave. He partnered Dancing Brave to victory in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and became the worldwide retained jockey of the colt's owner, Khalid Abdullah. While the press played up in the course of years the controversy between Starkey and Eddery, Eddery had been most reticent and underplayed the apparent falling out. Major winners in the Abdullah colours included Zafonic, Quest for Fame, Warning and Toulon. He was Champion Jockey a further seven times in eleven years between 1986 and 1996. His epic battle for championship in 1987 with American Steve Cauthen was particularly intense, with Cauthen winning the title with 197 and Eddery coming close at 195, and but for an objection from the third horse after the last definitive race in which Eddery won against Cauthen making the Championship a tie, the title would have been a shared one.To be a Champion, by Pat Eddery In the year 1988, Eddery completed 183 winners from 480 odd rides ‚Äì which was a great strike rate, and regained the title. Eddery also rode several major winners outside Europe including Jupiter Island in the 1986 Japan Cup and Pebbles in the 1985 Breeders' Cup Turf In North America he also won the Arlington Million on Tolomeo, the Canadian International Stakes on French Glory and the Breeders' Cup Sprint on Sheikh Albadou. An active racing ambassador overseas since his early years, Eddery joined forces with Lester Piggott, Joe Mercer and French champion Freddie Head and Yves Saint-Martin in a group of riders to take part in a series of challenge races under the 'Ritz Club Challenge Trophy' at Singapore and other Asian cities starting in 1983 for several years. Eddery's overseas winners, tallying with his British winners, exceeded well over 6,000. In 1990 he was the winner of the inaugural Lester Award for Flat Jockey of the Year, which he again won in 1991 and 1996, sharing on the latter occasion with Frankie Dettori. He also received two Flat Jockey Special Recognition awards in 2002 and 2003. He retired from the saddle at the end of the 2003 flat season and stated that he had no intention of becoming a trainer. For the most part of his ultra-successful riding career, and spanning a quarter of a century, Pat Eddery's booking agent was his brother-in-law Terry Ellis, from the time Eddery was under retainer with Peter Walwyn until 1999 when he was riding as freelance. They parted ways after Eddery underwent a slipped-disc operation in 1999, with Ellis helping out the other riding members of the Eddery family. Eddery summed up his attitude to the sport by saying, \\"That's all part of the game, going to the Folkestones and the smaller tracks, because it's not Royal Ascot every day. You've got to be out there every day working those muscles, riding in every race if you want to be at your best. There may be more money for a Derby than a seller but that doesn't make you try any harder. A winner is a winner.\\" In his autobiography, he admitted that his primary and sole motive as jockey was to ride winners, and any one saying that he does not wish to win is either a liar or a fool \\"To be Champion\\", 1992 Coronet Books Training career Despite his earlier statements and on the suggestion of wife Carolyn, in July 2005, Eddery was granted a training licence and set up a stable of 40 horses at Musk Hill Stud in Nether Winchendon, near Aylesbury. His brother, Paul Eddery, was Assistant Trainer and his Racing Manager was Simon Double who also co-founded Pat Eddery Racing, the racehorse syndication company which provided the opportunity for people to own shares in racehorses. Eddery's first runner as a trainer was Perez, who finished second in an all-weather maiden race at Wolverhampton in December 2005. His first training success was with the horse Visionist in a handicap race at Kempton Park in April 2006. His first winner on turf was the two-year-old filly Cavort in a maiden 6 furlong race at Goodwood. His trainer career culminated with Hearts Of Fire winning Italy's Group 1 Gran Criterium in 2009. He sent out his final runner in the week before his death. In 2005 he was awarded an honorary OBE, which he described as \\"a great honour\\". In 2012 he acted as a judge in the Godolphin Stud and Stable Staff Awards, giving up his free time generously in support of the industry he was so successful in. http://www.sportinglife.com/racing/news/article/465/10063133/legendary-jockey- pat-eddery-dies-aged-63-tributes-obituary-career-highlights-statistics Family One of the twelve living children of Jimmy Eddery and Josephine Moylan, the other four of the five male siblings of Pat Eddery are horse- riders in one way or the other: Michael, Robert, Paul and David. His uncle Robert Moylan also rode successfully. Pat Eddery married in November 1978 Carolyn, the daughter of flat jockey Manny Mercer, niece of jockey Joe Mercer, and granddaughter of jockey Harry Wragg. They had two daughters, Nichola and Natasha, and a son Harry. Eddery has another son, Toby Atkinson, who also became a jockey. The marriage broke down in 2008 and the couple formally divorced in 2009. Death Eddery died on 10 November 2015, aged 63 at Stoke Mandeville Hospital due to a heart attack, but suffered a long battle with alcoholism. His funeral was held on 8 December 2015 and he was cremated at Oxford after the funeral, with his ashes to be scattered on his family compound according to his last wishes.

a group of friends. The band was originally called African Khalam Orchestra. The band takes its name from the lute-like instrument the xalam. Xalam performed a mix of contemporary jazz tunes as well as African originals, usually sung in Wolof, the dominant local language although the leading artists are all Serer and Toucouleur. The band included sax, drums, African percussion, bass and electric guitar. History ;Beginnings Xalam started playing dance music, such as Rock, Salsa, Bossa, and Rhythm and Blues. The group performed in Senegal and other countries in Africa. Numerous musicians have played in the group and through their collaboration, have become very popular. In 1975 they went on an African tour with Hugh Masekela and Miriam Makeba. Later, the group decided it was time to find its own musical identity and left the stage for four years to look for inspiration in traditional folk music and mix it with their own modern music. In 1979, Xalam made a guest appearance at the Berlin Horizonte Festival. That first trip to Europe was their opportunity to record Ade, their first LP. ;1980s In 1981, Xalam recorded music for the soundtrack of the Epcot African Pavilion videotape in Dakar for the Disney Corporation, to be used at their Epcot site in the US. They also performed at the Dakar Jazz Festival and jammed with Dizzy Gillespie, Stan Getz, Dexter, Sonny Rollins, and others. In the early 1980s, the band moved to Paris, where they became regulars on the local music scene. Prosper died in the mid-1980s, replaced on drums by his younger brother, who had been the drummer for Senemali, another Senegalese group which had moved to Amsterdam. In June 1982, the group was revealed to the French public at Paris Africa F√™te. Then, band recorded the following LP, Gor√©e, in London. The band was so impressive that The Rolling Stones invited the percussionists to play on their next album Undercover of the Night. A European tour followed in 1983, Xalam opened for Crosby, Stills & Nash in Paris (Hippodrome d‚ÄôAuteuil) in front of 20,000 people. With the release of the LP Gor√©e, the album reached the Top 5 (African, Reggae, and Folk albums) published in Le Monde for five months. 1984 found the band writing the music for the French movie Marche √† l'Ombre (over 5,000,000 spectators), followed by 150 concerts starting in Switzerland and ending in Paris. Xalam opened for Robert Plant at the Palais des Sports in Paris, France, in 1985. In 1986, they performed three concerts at the Cirque d‚ÄôHiver, then continued on an international tour of more than a hundred gigs to support the release of Apartheid, including the Francofolies of La Rochelle, the Festag in Guadeloupe, and a long winter tour in Africa. A Canadian tour followed in 1987, including Montreal, Toronto, Qu√©bec, etc. Xalam also performed at the Printemps de Bourges in France and then recorded the LP Xarit in Paris. In 1988, they played a Parisian concert at The Wiz, a performance at the Paris Africa F√™te, then a show in Geneva, Switzerland (in front of 30,000 people), to aid the Helping Hand Cooperation for the N‚ÄôDem village in Senegal. The LP Xarit was released, followed by a tour of Austria, Tunisia (Carthage Festival), and Japan (Osaka, Sapporo, Tokyo and Ngoya) with resounding success. Then, they performed at the Anti-Apartheid Night: \\"Hommage √† Nelson Mandela\\" in Paris, at the Champ de Mars (in front of 25,000 people), and a concert at Montreux Casino. ;1990s Between 1989 and 1992, Xalam played various concerts and venues including The Midem in Cannes: concert at the Hotel Martinez, two concerts at the New Morning and La Cigale in Paris; a tour of Africa in 1990, then two concerts at the Auditorium des Halles, Paris; in 1991, a tour of Switzerland and Germany, and back to Switzerland for ten gigs, before recording the next LP Wam Sabindam. A 1993 French tour warmed up the public for the release of Wam Sabindam in September, followed by a Swiss tour (Arthur‚Äôs Club, Emmenthaler Thoune, Le Locle, Chapiteau Sambaille), and another in the spring of 1994 (Case √† Chocs, Albani, Bus Stop, Mad, Kantonsschule, M√ºhle Hunziken). They went to the US that summer, performing at the 25th Anniversary Woodstock Festival (in front of more than 500,000 people), and an English tour, including the Heathrow Festival. After a few shows in 1995 (i.e., Festival in Senegal with RFI (Radio France; the French Cultural Center), the band took a break. Xalam returned to the stage in 1999 in Switzerland for Le Locle Jazz Festival; a 2001 club tour in Paris, France (Baiser Sal√©, Petit Journal Montparnasse, etc.); a 2002 European Tour (Belgium, Switzerland, France); a Festival Tour in France in 2003; and a tour of France and Spain in 2004. ;2000s to present The band took another break, with some members leaving to pursue various solo projects (i.e., Taffa composing and playing with Jean-Luc Ponty, for theatrical pieces and clinics; Brahms with Manu Chao, Cheikh producing, composing and arranging with local musicians in Dakar; Henri producing and arranging, as well as managing the Quai des Arts in St. Louis, Senegal; Baye becoming involved planning events at a music center in Saint Germain en Laye, France, while playing with a Jazz trio; Souleymane leading a successful solo career in Dakar). In the fall of 2008 and the spring of 2009, the band made a comeback, with concerts in Dakar Senegal (Just4You, St. Louis Jazz Festival, Iba Mar Diop Stadium) and Burkina Faso. The reunion tour coincided with the re-release of Apartheid on CD and the first-time release of their live performance, the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1991 (Live √† Montreux) on CD, and a Best of two-CD set [2A@Z], on which all tracks were entirely remastered. Xalam was working on a new studio CD, and a DVD release of the 29 April 2009 show at Iba Mar Diop Stadium. They continued to tour, with dates in Lebanon and Johannesburg, South Africa in September/October 2009, and in Dakar, where they worked on new concert dates and projects. In April 2010, the 50th Anniversary of the Independence of Senegal was marked by some special concerts/gala evenings for Xalam in Dakar, Saint-Louis, South Africa and Zimbabwe. They returned to Paris in 2013 for some shows at Quai Branly and Baiser Sal√©. Since then, Xalam has continued to tour and play shows in Africa, and were finally able to release their new CD, Waxati in 2015.

Roberts. Land Use Planning and Development Regulatory Law. St. Paul, MN: West Group, 2003. 351-373. Impact fees are considered to be a charge on new development to help fund and pay for the construction or needed expansion of offsite capital improvements. These fees are usually implemented to help reduce the economic burden on local jurisdictions that are trying to deal with population growth within the area.  History  Impact fees were first implemented in Hinsdale, Illinois in 1947. To finance a water treatment plant expansion, the Hinsdale Sanitary District president John A. McElwain implemented a \\"tap-in\\" fee of $50 per new residential sewer line. The sanitary district was sued by the Illinois Home Building Association, but the district prevailed. The case was appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court and that court ruled that impact fees are legal if used for capital expenditures, but not legal if used for operating expenses. Impact fees became more widely accepted in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s. First used to help fund capital recovery fees for water and sewer facilities, then in the 1970s, with the decline of available Federal and State grants for local governments, their use increased and expanded to non-utility uses including roads, parks, schools, and other public services. Finally, in the 1980s the impact fee became a universally used funding approach for services and started to include municipal facilities such as fire, police, and libraries. After court cases in states such as Florida and California approved their legal use, many other states enacted laws which approved the use of impact fees by local jurisdictions. Impact fees have developed as an offspring of in lieu fees but have had a more significant effect on funding infrastructure. In some cases, the use of the impact fee has developed its own phrase of \\"growth should pay its own way\\".  In lieu fee  The use of impact fees originated in environmental law practices and in lieu fees. In Lieu fees are different from impact fees and are not as flexible because they relate only to required dedications where they can be appropriately used. Because the use of the in lieu fee may not always be efficient, planners and cities are now turning to impact fees as a more appropriate way to collect money for facilities and services. Impact fees can be more easily applied to needed infrastructure or facilities while in lieu fees cannot. Impact fees can be applied before new development is started or completed, which may allow costs to be transferred to future residents in the area. Another advantage of using an impact fee compared to the in lieu fee is that it can be applied to any new construction from single family homes, apartments, and even commercial development. In lieu fees may not always be as easily applied to any specific zone. Finally, impact fees can be implemented earlier than in lieu fees so that the capital need matches the need for services.  Implementation and legal basis  There are two main rationales that focus on how to implement impact fees. The first focuses on recognizing that the fees are positive exactions of funds for a community and should be used in that manner. Second, impact fees should be used for any need in the community. At the time when impact fee usage first started people argued whether they should just focus on utility types or include other types of special services of facilities. Some argued for just utility types because only the people paying the actual fee would receive the service. This is known as a closed ended use. An open ended use, such as parks or libraries, allows anyone to use the service, even if they have not directly paid for the service. Still people argue and believe that development can affect all services and should help contribute to them. When it comes to implementing impact fees there is a legal basis that must be considered or followed in order for legal implementation. They must follow the rational nexus and roughly proportional rules or guidelines. There must be a connection between the new development and the need for the new facilities in the region. Also, the impact fee must be able to benefit the person paying the fee along with calculating the fee on a fair proportionate formula for all residents. One main dilemma with implementing the fee is characterized as the exclusiveness of benefit. It focuses on determining who should pay for what in the case of impact fees. Some may have to pay for the fee, but may not get to use the service which can be seen as a tax, but by using impact fees on people that cause the need for the new service it helps to not cause a tax on everyone and allows those that are not using the service to be excluded from paying the fee.  How they are used  Impact fees have become the most important method in infrastructure financing and an essential part of local governments to fund infrastructure or public services. Impact fees may help to assist in the development of needed parks, schools, roads, sewer, water treatment, utilities, libraries, and public safety buildings to the newly developed area. In most cases impact fees are used in new development. An example of this would be when a new neighborhood or commercial development is constructed the developer may be forced to pay the fee for new infrastructure or a new fire station in the area due to the demand the new development causes. In some cases the developer may pass on the fee to the future property owners through housing costs or charges. It can be seen as a growth management tool that collects development funding payment as a way to exercise police power. Impact Fees are seen as a regulation tool, but at the same time their revenue raising purpose can be seen as a tax to some. Still most states recognize and allow the use of impact fees as a way to regulate land use. The cost of an impact fee can vary from state to state. Generally, areas in the Western United States charge higher fees than other places in the country. They can also vary depending on the type of need by a community with school facilities causing the greatest cost of an impact fee. Depending on the region or stated impact fees can be classified under different types of names. Early on they were known as Capital Recovery or Expansion fees. In some states such as Oregon they are known as system development charges while in North Carolina they are known as facility fees. No matter the title of the fee within a state they all function on the same premise. Today, impact fees have become a popularly used method. About 60% of all cities with over 25,000 residents along with 40% of metropolitan counties use impact fees on new developments for public services or infrastructure. In some cities or states such as Florida, 90% of communities use Impact Fees. Twenty six states have implemented the use of impact fees in the western portion of the country, along the Atlantic coast, and within the Great Lakes region.  Court cases  Court cases along the way have dealt with the issue of impact fees. Two main cases that dealt with impact fees development have been Pioneer Trust and Savings Bank v. Mount Prospect and Gulest Associate Incorporated v. Newburgh. Another is Krupp versus Breckenridge Sanitation District, where the Colorado Supreme Court found that a wastewater impact fee was lawful and not subject to a takings analysis.KRUPP v. BRECKENRIDGE SANITATION DISTRICT Supreme Court of Colorado 19 P.3d 687; 2001 Colo. LEXIS 134; 2001 Colo. J. C.A.R. 930 February 26, 2001, Decided The U.S. Constitution's Takings Clause was found to apply to an impact fee by the U.S. Supreme Court in Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District.  Linkage and mitigation fees  Since impact fees have been so widely accepted with cities, counties, and states they have helped to lead to the development/encroachment of other types of regulation fees. Two main examples are linkage fees and mitigation fees. Linkage fees are levied in some states (such as Massachusetts, New Jersey, and California) on nonresidential and market-rate multifamily residential projects, normally upon receipt of the building permit or prior to construction. Linkage fees are a derivative of development impact fees and are exacted on developers by some cities and countries to pay for a number of facilities and services. The proceeds are used to fund the construction of affordable housing residential developments. Arguments against linkage fees are similar to impact fees, including the question of whether local governments have the right to enact these types of programs. Linkage fees and inclusionary zoning regulations are two examples of local government methods to boost the supply of affordable housing. Mitigation fees are similar to impact and linkage fees but they differ in that their focus is on the environment. These fees are charged to reimburse or compensate the community for the negative impact that development may have on the community. In some cases these fees are used to help preserve a component of the local environment and regulate pollution. There is debate about whether these types of fees are a legally acceptable form of government funding as impact and linkage fees are.  Criticism  Impact fees are accepted forms of financing in many communities in the country. Still, their use is not universally accepted, and the use of impact fees as a means to collect revenue is still controversial in many communities. One argument against impact fees is that they may constrain and hurt the local economy. The argument includes the assertion that they may serve as a de facto tax which can have a result of slowing or ending development in an area and instead cause investment in other areas that do not levy impact fees. Another argument is that the fees increase the price of housing‚Äîespecially new construction, where developers who pay the fees pass the cost of the fees onto the future property owners. Another concern is that the negative effect that they may have on a local economy may directly hurt job growth and reduce the number of jobs that are available in an area.

They are considered helpful species in agriculture because of their predation on many types of crop pests.Braman, S. K. 2000. Damsel bugs (Nabidae). Pp. 639‚Äì656. In: Schaefer C. W. & Panizzi A. R. (eds.): Heteroptera of Economic Importance. CRC Press, Boca Raton. Damsel bugs of the genus Nabis are the most common. They and other genera are most numerous in fields of legumes such as alfalfa, but they can be found in many other crops and in non-cultivated areas. They are yellow to tan in color and have large, bulbous eyes and stiltlike legs. They are generalist predators, catching almost any insect smaller than themselves, and cannibalizing each other when no other food is available. Several species have bitten humans.Fa√∫ndez, E.

History American Bell Consumer Products was created on January 1, 1983, as a unit of American Bell, Inc., upon declaration by the Modification of Final Judgment that American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T;)Not to be confused with the AT&T; of 2005 and later, a renaming of SBC Communications, Inc. had to sell equipment to the public through an entirely separate subsidiary. American Bell Consumer Products sold terminal equipment traditionally available through the Bell System, such as the Trimline telephone. American Bell products could be found at Bell PhoneCenter Stores, as well as department stores such as Sears and Target. American Bell products were not marked with any Bell name, but simply marked \\"Western Electric\\" and the Bell logo, as any products sold through American Bell were not \\"Bell System Property\\". Upon the divestiture of the Bell Operating Companies from AT&T;, American Bell was renamed AT&T; Information Systems, and American Bell Consumer Products was renamed AT&T; Consumer Products, and Bell PhoneCenters were renamed AT&T; PhoneCenters. Bell and Western Electric markings were replaced with AT&T; on telephone housings. AT&T; Consumer Products became responsible for leased telephones and manufactured telephones on January 1, 1984. AT&T; Consumer Products was absorbed into AT&T; Technologies in 1989. AT&T; Consumer Products ceased operations of AT&T; Phone Centers in 1995, deciding to simply focus on leasing equipment and on sales at department stores. It, along with the rest of AT&T; Technologies and Bell Laboratories, became a part of Lucent Technologies in 1996, following completion of its spinoff from AT&T.; Lucent Technologies Consumer Products, L.P. (LTCP) became the new name of AT&T; Consumer Products in 1996. Its operations remained largely unchanged from its operations at AT&T.; In 1997, LTCP was placed in the unsuccessful Philips Consumer Communications joint venture. LTCP was retained after the venture failed. In 2000, Lucent opted to reorganize its equipment units, spinning off its Networks Systems unit as Avaya, and selling off its Consumer Products unit. Its telephone leasing operation was sold to Consumer Phone Services, and its consumer telephone manufacturing division was purchased by VTech on April 2, 2000. Today Renamed VTech Innovation, L.P., the former LTCP manufacturing division does business as Advanced American Telephones. Telephone production was abruptly shifted to China. Advanced American Telephones also entered a 20 licensing agreement with AT&T; that will end in 2020 to use the AT&T; brand on all telephones it would produce.

The Edmonton Gardens was the first indoor hockey arena built in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It was originally built as Edmonton Stock Pavilion in 1913, and held 5,200 spectators after its 1966 renovations. It was home to the World Hockey Association's Edmonton Oilers from 1972 to 1974. The Oilers moved to the brand new Northlands Coliseum after the 1973‚Äì74 season. In addition to the Oilers, the Edmonton Oil Kings, Edmonton Eskimos hockey team, and Edmonton Flyers played their home games at Edmonton Gardens. It held a wide variety of events, including hockey, curling, basketball, boxing, figure skating, circuses, rodeos, bingo nights, car shows, conventions, horse shows, and bull sales. The arena was built at the fairgrounds in order to be away from the city, thus allowing it to also be used as a livestock pavilion, alongside the stables and horse race track. The Northlands Park race track still exists on the exhibition grounds. The opening ceremonies were held on Christmas Day 1913, exactly 19 years after Edmonton's first hockey game, featuring a hockey game between two Stanley Cup finalists, the Edmonton Eskimos and the Edmonton Dominions, which over 2,000 fans attended. Their previous arena, Thistle Rink, had just burnt down that year. The Dominion's forward Russell \\"Barney\\" Stanley would become a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, and the arena would be home to other Stanley Cup finalist teams, Memorial Cup teams, and three Memorial Cups. It was the only home of the Edmonton Flyers (1939‚Äì51). The Gardens got the nickname \\"The Cow Barn\\" from attendants emphasizing its use for agriculture exhibitions, in particular for livestock shows. It also was notorious for bad sight lines and uncomfortable seats. The girders, that were also in the way of spectators, dripped water onto the ice/play surface creating mounds during play. By the 1960s, it was often criticized as being a fire hazard. A $60,000 improvement in 1963 did little to improve its safety, leading to having seven Edmonton Fire Department firemen stationed at each event. Media increasingly called it a dirty, obsolete, and rickety building, and an April 15, 1966 Edmonton Journal article called Edmonton Gardens \\"a disaster waiting to happen. The old house, with its obsolete lighting fixtures, oily wooden floors, and sordid washrooms, is an eyesore to hockey fans.\\" The following month, the city Fire Chief condemned it, and ordered it closed as a fire hazard. That summer saw a $670,000 renovation that gutted the interior, and replaced the steel girders with eight inch columns at 45¬∞. The wooden bleachers were replaced with a fireproof concrete grandstand, and reduced the seating capacity to 5,200. The Oilers and Oil Kings moved across 118 Avenue to Northlands Coliseum, in 1974. Demolition of the Gardens began January 20, 1982, but quickly disproved the moniker \\"accident waiting to happen.\\" \\"Firstly, they stuffed it with 50 kilograms of dynamite, then, they used a bulldozer, but still the grand old lady of Edmonton sports wouldn't budge,\\" one story reported. \\"Gardens won‚Äôt go boom,\\" the headline read, recounting two days of the crew drilling holes into the walls and supports, and then cramming in 320 sticks of dynamite. An Edmonton Journal article on February 25, 1982 read \\"Gardens 2 TNT 0. A second try at demolishing what's left of the Edmonton Gardens ended with a wham, a puff of dust and peals of laughter. The building stood in mock defiance amid hoots of glee from the gallery (of onlookers).\\" Northlands Park elected to finish the demolition with a wrecking ball. Another arena, Hall D of the Edmonton EXPO Centre, currently occupies the site. Indoor soccer Because the Northlands Coliseum was unavailable, Game 1 of the 1981 NASL indoor finals was played at the Edmonton Gardens on March 2, 1981. In it the Edmonton Drillers defeated the Chicago Sting, 9‚Äì6, in front of 5,089 fans. The Drillers went onto sweep the finals, two games to none, five days later in Chicago.

It was released in Japan for the PC and PlayStation 2 on August 31, 2006; the Xbox 360 version was released there on December 12, 2006. Its North American release was in October 2006, in all formats. The European release date was November 24 the same year, while the Australian release date was November 30. Phantasy Star Universe is similar to the Phantasy Star Online (PSO) games, but takes place in a different time period and location, and has many new features. Like most of the PSO titles, PSU was playable in both a persistent online network mode and a fully featured, single-player story mode. Plot Ethan Waber, the main character, and his younger sister, Lumia Waber, are at the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Alliance Space Fleet on the GUARDIANS Space station. The celebration is interrupted when a mysterious meteor shower almost destroys the entire fleet. During an evacuation, Ethan and Lumia divert from the main evacuation route; collapsing rubble separates Lumia from Ethan. Ethan then meets up with a GUARDIAN named Leo, but they are attacked by a strange creature that paralyzes Leo. Ethan kills the creature. After killing multiple creatures and saving people, Ethan finds Lumia and they leave the station. Ethan reveals that he dislikes the GUARDIANS organization because his father died on a mission. Leo, impressed with Ethan's abilities, persuades Ethan to join the GUARDIANS. Ethan and his classmate Hyuga Ryght are trained by a GUARDIAN named Karen Erra, who leads them against the SEED, the monsters that came from the meteors. After being hired to accompany a scientist to a RELICS site of an ancient, long-dead civilization, they find out that the SEED are attracted to a power source A-Photons, which the ancients used and that the solar system has just rediscovered. Karen discovers she is the sister of the Divine Maiden, the prophet of the Holy Light, and takes over that role when her sister dies at the hands of her estranged father who intended to kill Karen to increase the power of the original Divine Maiden (Mirei). After befriending Rogues, Guardians, and CASTs alike, Ethan angers Magashi, a CAST who heads the Endrum Collective and has been kidnapping scientists who know about the ancient power source. Ethan and a Rogue named Alfort Tylor kill Magashi. Ethan helps activate an ancient weapon the prior civilization used to survive the SEED before they were almost completely wiped out. Ethan gathers allies against GUARDIAN orders to attack the last SEED outpost, where two of his friends and the scientists are being held. In the outpost, Magashi claims to have been resurrected by the SEED, but he is actually a CAST incarnation of Dark Force, who controls the SEED and whatever they infect. With the help of Karen, Leo, and Tonnio, Ethan defeats Magashi. =Continuation= Ambition of the Illuminus is a direct continuation of Phantasy Star Universe. Shortly after the defeat of Magashi and the Endrum Collective, a mysterious group known as the Illuminus have appeared and threaten to exterminate all non-human races. The GUARDIANS are under attack, and Ethan Waber is now wanted for an attempted assassination. GUARDIAN instructor Laia Martinez is determined to find Ethan at any cost. As a new GUARDIAN receiving guidance from Laia, the player must search for Ethan and uncover the truth. =Setting= The universe is the Gurhal Star System, which consists of three planets; Parum, Neudaiz, and Moatoob - as well as a large space station, which, in addition to housing a large civilian population, also serves as the headquarters of the Guardians. Each planet has its own unique culture formed by its inhabitant races. The history of the Gurhal Star System is filled with conflict among the different races. However, after the Final Conflict 100 years ago, a union was formed between the three planets. This led to the birth of the Allied Army and ultimately to peace for the Gurhal Star System. Development Promotion at the Tokyo Game Show 2005 The game was first unveiled at E3 2004, with a subsequent showing at the next E3, and then again at TGS 2005. A closed beta stress test for the servers took place between April and May 2006. Release =Ambition of the Illuminus= is the first expansion of Phantasy Star Universe, available for Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox 360. It was released initially in Japan on September 27, 2007, for PlayStation 2 and PC; subsequent territorial releases followed in November 2007, when North America received the expansion for all three platforms. This date also marked the worldwide release of the Xbox 360 version, which was available for download through Microsoft's Xbox Live service. Although it is an expansion pack, the Windows and PlayStation 2 versions of Ambition of the Illuminus are standalone and do not require the original game to play. The Xbox 360 version does require the original disc because the expansion is downloadable content. On June 30, 2010, the expansion became free on Xbox Live. As of July 20, 2010, the expansion is required for users wishing to play online. An updated version was released at this time which contains GUARDIANS Advanced Content. Ambition of the Illuminus introduced numerous new features to Phantasy Star Universe including new weapons, Photon Arts, missions, clothing, enemies, and more. =Server closures= Due to low levels of use, the North American and PAL PC/PS2 servers of Phantasy Star Universe were shut down on March 31, 2010. PS2 support for the Japanese servers was discontinued on April 14, 2011. The Xbox 360 servers were shut down on September 7, 2012. The Japanese PC servers were closed as of 00:00 JST on September 28, 2012.„Çµ„Éº„Éì„ÇπÁµÇ‰∫Ü„ÅÆ„ÅäÁü•„Çâ„Åõ Reception =Phantasy Star Universe= The game received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Erik Brudvig of IGN said of the PlayStation 2 version, \\"The result is an unsatisfying and stale experience that feels like an update to an old game that has had its day rather than a new title.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave the PS2 version a score of two nines, one eight, and one nine for a total of 35 out of 40. =Ambition of the Illuminus= The PS2 version of the Ambition of the Illuminus expansion pack received \\"average\\" reviews, while the PC version received \\"unfavorable\\" reviews, according to Metacritic. Legacy PSU's setting, story, and characters have been continued and expanded upon in three PlayStation Portable games; Phantasy Star Portable, Phantasy Star Portable 2, and Phantasy Star Portable 2: Infinity. The games offer new features and content; as in the Ambition of the Illuminus expansion pack, the player plays through the story mode as her or his own character. In the Japanese version of Phantasy Star Portable, it was possible to import some character data from the PC and PS2 versions of the game, this was however not possible in other regions.

CSCs are therefore tumorigenic (tumor-forming), perhaps in contrast to other non-tumorigenic cancer cells. CSCs may generate tumors through the stem cell processes of self-renewal and differentiation into multiple cell types. Such cells are hypothesized to persist in tumors as a distinct population and cause relapse and metastasis by giving rise to new tumors. Therefore, development of specific therapies targeted at CSCs holds hope for improvement of survival and quality of life of cancer patients, especially for patients with metastatic disease. Existing cancer treatments have mostly been developed based on animal models, where therapies able to promote tumor shrinkage were deemed effective. However, animals do not provide a complete model of human disease. In particular, in mice, whose life spans do not exceed two years, tumor relapse is difficult to study. The efficacy of cancer treatments is, in the initial stages of testing, often measured by the ablation fraction of tumor mass (fractional kill). As CSCs form a small proportion of the tumor, this may not necessarily select for drugs that act specifically on the stem cells. The theory suggests that conventional chemotherapies kill differentiated or differentiating cells, which form the bulk of the tumor but do not generate new cells. A population of CSCs, which gave rise to it, could remain untouched and cause relapse. Cancer stem cells were first identified by John Dick in acute myeloid leukemia in the late 1990s. Since the early 2000s they have been an intense cancer research focus. The term itself was coined in a highly cited paper in 2001 by biologists Tannishtha Reya, Sean J. Morrison, Michael F. Clarke and Irving Weissman.  Tumor propagation models  In different tumor subtypes, cells within the tumor population exhibit functional heterogeneity and tumors are formed from cells with various proliferative and differentiation capacities. This functional heterogeneity among cancer cells has led to the creation of multiple propagation models to account for heterogeneity and differences in tumor-regenerative capacity: the cancer stem cell (CSC) and stochastic model. However, certain perspectives maintain that this demarcation is artificial, since both processes act in complementary manners as far as actual tumor populations are concerned. Figure 2: A normal cellular hierarchy comprising stem cells at the apex, which generate common and more restricted progenitor cells and ultimately the mature cell types that constitute particular tissues. Figure 3. In the cancer stem cell (CSC) model, only the CSCs have the ability to generate a tumor, based on their self- renewal properties and proliferative potential. =The cancer stem cell model= The cancer stem cell model, also known as the Hierarchical Model proposes that tumors are hierarchically organized (CSCs lying at the apex (Fig. 3).) Within the cancer population of the tumors there are cancer stem cells (CSC) that are tumorigenic cells and are biologically distinct from other subpopulations They have two defining features: their long-term ability to self-renew and their capacity to differentiate into progeny that is non- tumorigenic but still contributes to the growth of the tumor. This model suggests that only certain subpopulations of cancer stem cells have the ability to drive the progression of cancer, meaning that there are specific (intrinsic) characteristics that can be identified and then targeted to destroy a tumor long-term without the need to battle the whole tumor. =Stochastic model= In order for a cell to become cancerous it must undergo a significant number of alterations to its DNA sequence. This cell model suggests these mutations could occur to any cell in the body resulting in a cancer. Essentially this theory proposes that all cells have the ability to be tumorigenic making all tumor cells equipotent with the ability to self-renew or differentiate, leading to tumor heterogeneity while others can differentiate into non-CSCs The cell's potential can be influenced by unpredicted genetic or epigenetic factors, resulting in phenotypically diverse cells in both the tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cells that compose the tumor. According to the ‚Äústochastic model‚Äù (or ‚Äúclonal evolution model‚Äù) every cancer cell in a tumor could gain the ability to self-renew and differentiate to the numerous and heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells that compromise a tumor These mutations could progressively accumulate and enhance the resistance and fitness of cells that allow them to outcompete other tumor cells, better known as the somatic evolution model. The clonal evolution model, which occurs in both the CSC model and stochastic model, postulates that mutant tumor cells with a growth advantage outproliferate others. Cells in the dominant population have a similar potential for initiating tumor growth. (Fig. 4).Figure 4: In the clonal evolution model, all undifferentiated cells have similar possibility to change into a tumorigenic cell. These two models are not mutually exclusive, as CSCs themselves undergo clonal evolution. Thus, the secondary more dominant CSCs may emerge, if a mutation confers more aggressive properties (Fig. 5). =Tying CSC and stochastic models together= A study in 2014 argues the gap between these two controversial models can be bridged by providing an alternative explanation of tumor heterogeneity. They demonstrate a model that includes aspects of both the Stochastic and CSC models. They examined cancer stem cell plasticity in which cancer stem cells can transition between non-cancer stem cells (Non-CSC) and CSC via in situ supporting a more Stochastic model. But the existence of both biologically distinct non-CSC and CSC populations supports a more CSC model, proposing that both models may play a vital role in tumor heterogeneity. Figure 5: Both tumor models may play a role in the maintenance of a tumor. Initially, tumor growth is assured with a specific CSC (CSC1). With tumor progression, another CSC (CSC 2) may arise due to the clonal selection. The development of a new more aggressive CSC may result from the acquisition of an additional mutation or epigenetic modification. =The cancer stem cell immunology model= This model suggests that immunological properties may be important for understanding tumorigenesis and heterogeneity. As such, CSCs can be very rare in some tumors, > but some researchers found that a large proportion of tumor cells can initiate tumors if transplanted into severely immunocompromised mice, and thus questioned the relevance of rare CSCs. However, both stem cells and CSCs possess unique immunological properties which render them highly resistant towards immunosurveillance. Thus, only CSCs may be able to seed tumors in patients with functional immunosurveillance, and immune privilege may be a key criterion for identifying CSCs. Furthermore, the model suggests that CSCs may initially be dependent on stem cell niches, and CSCs may function there as a reservoir in which mutations can accumulate over decades unrestricted by the immune system. Clinically overt tumors may grow if: A) CSCs lose their dependence on niche factors (less differentiated tumors), B) their offspring of highly proliferative, yet initially immunogenic normal tumor cells evolve means to escape immunosurveillance or C) the immune system may lose its tumorsuppressive capacity, e.g. due to ageing. Debate The existence of CSCs is under debate, because many studies found no cells with their specific characteristics. > Cancer cells must be capable of continuous proliferation and self-renewal to retain the many mutations required for carcinogenesis and to sustain the growth of a tumor, since differentiated cells (constrained by the Hayflick Limit) cannot divide indefinitely. For therapeutic consideration, if most tumor cells are endowed with stem cell properties, targeting tumor size directly is a valid strategy. If CSCs are a small minority, targeting them may be more effective. Another debate is over the origin of CSCs - whether from dysregulation of normal stem cells or from a more specialized population that acquired the ability to self-renew (which is related to the issue of stem cell plasticity). Confounding this debate is the discovery that many cancer cells demonstrate a Phenotypic plasticity under therapeutic challenge, altering their transcriptomes to a more stem-like state to escape destruction.  Evidence  The first conclusive evidence for CSCs came in 1997. Bonnet and Dick isolated a subpopulation of leukemia cells that expressed surface marker CD34, but not CD38. The authors established that the CD34+/CD38‚àí subpopulation is capable of initiating tumors in NOD/SCID mice that were histologically similar to the donor. The first evidence of a solid tumor cancer stem-like cell followed in 2002 with the discovery of a clonogenic, sphere-forming cell isolated and characterized from adult human brain gliomas. Human cortical glial tumors contain neural stem-like cells expressing astroglial and neuronal markers in vitro. Cancer stem cells isolated from adult human gliomas were shown to induce tumours that resembled the parent tumour when grafted into intracranial nude mouse models. In cancer research experiments, tumor cells are sometimes injected into an experimental animal to establish a tumor. Disease progression is then followed in time and novel drugs can be tested for their efficacy. Tumor formation requires thousands or tens of thousands of cells to be introduced. Classically, this was explained by poor methodology (i.e., the tumor cells lose their viability during transfer) or the critical importance of the microenvironment, the particular biochemical surroundings of the injected cells. Supporters of the CSC paradigm argue that only a small fraction of the injected cells, the CSCs, have the potential to generate a tumor. In human acute myeloid leukemia the frequency of these cells is less than 1 in 10,000. Further evidence comes from histology. Many tumors are heterogeneous and contain multiple cell types native to the host organ. Tumour heterogeneity is commonly retained by tumor metastases. This suggests that the cell that produced them had the capacity to generate multiple cell types, a classical hallmark of stem cells. The existence of leukemia stem cells prompted research into other cancers. CSCs have recently been identified in several solid tumors, including: * Brain * Breast * Colon * Ovary * Pancreas * Prostate *Melanoma *Multiple Myeloma *Non- melanoma skin cancer =Mechanistic and mathematical models= Once the pathways to cancer are hypothesized, it is possible to develop predictive mathematical models, e.g., based on the cell compartment method. For instance, the growths of abnormal cells can be denoted with specific mutation probabilities. Such a model predicted that repeated insult to mature cells increases the formation of abnormal progeny and the risk of cancer. The clinical efficacy of such models remains unestablished. Origin Figure 6: Hierarchical organisation of a tumour according to the CSC model The origin of CSCs is an active research area. The answer may depend on the tumor type and phenotype. So far the hypothesis that tumors originate from a single \\"cell of origin\\" has not been demonstrated using the cancer stem cell model. This is because cancer stem cells are not present in end-stage tumors. Origin hypotheses include mutants in developing stem or progenitor cells, mutants in adult stem cells or adult progenitor cells and mutant, differentiated cells that acquire stem-like attributes. These theories often focus on a tumor's \\"cell of origin\\". = Hypotheses =  Stem cell mutation  The \\"mutation in stem cell niche populations during development\\" hypothesis claims that these developing stem populations are mutated and then reproduce so that the mutation is shared by many descendants. These daughter cells are much closer to becoming tumors and their numbers increase the chance of a cancerous mutation.  Adult stem cells  Another theory associates adult stem cells (ASC) with tumor formation. This is most often associated with tissues with a high rate of cell turnover (such as the skin or gut). In these tissues, ASCs are candidates because of their frequent cell divisions (compared to most ASCs) in conjunction with the long lifespan of ASCs. This combination creates the ideal set of circumstances for mutations to accumulate: mutation accumulation is the primary factor that drives cancer initiation. Evidence shows that the association represents an actual phenomenon, although specific cancers have been linked to a specific cause.  De-differentiation  De- differentiation of mutated cells may create stem cell-like characteristics, suggesting that any cell might become a cancer stem cell. In other words, a fully differentiated cell undergoes mutations or extracellular signals that drive it back to a stem-like state. This concept has been demonstrated most recently in Prostate cancer models, whereby cells undergoing androgen deprivation therapy appear to transiently alter their transcriptome to that of a neural crest stem-like cell, with the invasive and multipotent properties of this class of stem-like cells. = Hierarchy = The concept of tumor hierarchy claims that a tumor is a heterogeneous population of mutant cells, all of which share some mutations, but vary in specific phenotype. A tumor hosts several types of stem cells, one optimal to the specific environment and other less successful lines. These secondary lines may be more successful in other environments, allowing the tumor to adapt, including adaptation to therapeutic intervention. If correct, this concept impacts cancer stem cell- specific treatment regimes. Such a hierarchy would complicate attempts to pinpoint the origin.  Identification  CSCs, now reported in most human tumors, are commonly identified and enriched using strategies for identifying normal stem cells that are similar across studies. These procedures include fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), with antibodies directed at cell- surface markers and functional approaches including side population assay or Aldefluor assay. The CSC-enriched result is then implanted, at various doses, in immune-deficient mice to assess its tumor development capacity. This in vivo assay is called a limiting dilution assay. The tumor cell subsets that can initiate tumor development at low cell numbers are further tested for self-renewal capacity in serial tumor studies. CSCs can also be identified by efflux of incorporated Hoechst dyes via multidrug resistance (MDR) and ATP- binding cassette (ABC) Transporters. Another approach is sphere-forming assays. Many normal stem cells such as hematopoietic or stem cells from tissues, under special culture conditions, form three-dimensional spheres that can differentiate. As with normal stem cells, the CSCs isolated from brain or prostate tumors also have the ability to form anchor-independent spheres.  Heterogeneity (markers)  CSCs have been identified in various solid tumors. Commonly, markers specific for normal stem cells are used for isolating CSCs from solid and hematological tumors. Markers most frequently used for CSC isolation include: CD133 (also known as PROM1), CD44, ALDH1A1, CD34, CD24 and EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule, also known as epithelial specific antigen, ESA). CD133 (prominin 1) is a five-transmembrane domain glycoprotein expressed on CD34+ stem and progenitor cells, in endothelial precursors and fetal neural stem cells. It has been detected using its glycosylated epitope known as AC133. EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule, ESA, TROP1) is hemophilic Ca2+-independent cell adhesion molecule expressed on the basolateral surface of most epithelial cells. CD90 (THY1) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol glycoprotein anchored in the plasma membrane and involved in signal transduction. It may also mediate adhesion between thymocytes and thymic stroma. CD44 (PGP1) is an adhesion molecule that has pleiotropic roles in cell signaling, migration and homing. It has multiple isoforms, including CD44H, which exhibits high affinity for hyaluronate and CD44V which has metastatic properties. CD24 (HSA) is a glycosylated glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored adhesion molecule, which has co- stimulatory role in B and T cells. CD200 (OX-2) is a type 1 membrane glycoprotein, which delivers an inhibitory signal to immune cells including T cells, natural killer cells and macrophages. ALDH is a ubiquitous aldehyde dehydrogenase family of enzymes, which catalyzes the oxidation of aromatic aldehydes to carboxyl acids. For instance, it has a role in conversion of retinol to retinoic acid, which is essential for survival. The first solid malignancy from which CSCs were isolated and identified was breast cancer and they are the most intensely studied. Breast CSCs have been enriched in CD44+CD24‚àí/low, SP and ALDH+ subpopulations. Breast CSCs are apparently phenotypically diverse. CSC marker expression in breast cancer cells is apparently heterogeneous and breast CSC populations vary across tumors. Both CD44+CD24‚àí and CD44+CD24+ cell populations are tumor initiating cells; however, CSC are most highly enriched using the marker profile CD44+CD49fhiCD133/2hi. CSCs have been reported in many brain tumors. Stem-like tumor cells have been identified using cell surface markers including CD133, SSEA-1 (stage-specific embryonic antigen-1), EGFR and CD44. The use of CD133 for identification of brain tumor stem-like cells may be problematic because tumorigenic cells are found in both CD133+ and CD133‚àí cells in some gliomas and some CD133+ brain tumor cells may not possess tumor-initiating capacity. CSCs were reported in human colon cancer. For their identification, cell surface markers such as CD133, CD44 and ABCB5, functional analysis including clonal analysis and Aldefluor assay were used. Using CD133 as a positive marker for colon CSCs generated conflicting results. The AC133 epitope, but not the CD133 protein, is specifically expressed in colon CSCs and its expression is lost upon differentiation. In addition, CD44+ colon cancer cells and additional sub-fractionation of CD44+EpCAM+ cell population with CD166 enhance the success of tumor engraftments. Multiple CSCs have been reported in prostate, lung and many other organs, including liver, pancreas, kidney or ovary. In prostate cancer, the tumor-initiating cells have been identified in CD44+ cell subset as CD44+Œ±2Œ≤1+, TRA-1-60+CD151+CD166+ or ALDH+ cell populations. Putative markers for lung CSCs have been reported, including CD133+, ALDH+, CD44+ and oncofetal protein 5T4+.  Metastasis  Metastasis is the major cause of tumor lethality. However, not every tumor cell can metastasize. This potential depends on factors that determine growth, angiogenesis, invasion and other basic processes. = Epithelial-mesenchymal transition = In epithelial tumors, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is considered to be a crucial event. EMT and the reverse transition from mesenchymal to an epithelial phenotype (MET) are involved in embryonic development, which involves disruption of epithelial cell homeostasis and the acquisition of a migratory mesenchymal phenotype. EMT appears to be controlled by canonical pathways such as WNT and transforming growth factor Œ≤. EMT's important feature is the loss of membrane E-cadherin in adherens junctions, where Œ≤-catenin may play a significant role. Translocation of Œ≤-catenin from adherens junctions to the nucleus may lead to a loss of E-cadherin and subsequently to EMT. Nuclear Œ≤-catenin apparently can directly, transcriptionally activate EMT-associated target genes, such as the E-cadherin gene repressor SLUG (also known as SNAI2). Mechanical properties of the tumor microenvironment, such as hypoxia, can contribute to CSC survival and metastatic potential through stabilization of hypoxia inducible factors through interactions with ROS (reactive oxygen species). Tumor cells undergoing an EMT may be precursors for metastatic cancer cells, or even metastatic CSCs. In the invasive edge of pancreatic carcinoma, a subset of CD133+CXCR4+ (receptor for CXCL12 chemokine also known as a SDF1 ligand) cells was defined. These cells exhibited significantly stronger migratory activity than their counterpart CD133+CXCR4‚àí cells, but both showed similar tumor development capacity. Moreover, inhibition of the CXCR4 receptor reduced metastatic potential without altering tumorigenic capacity. = Two-phase expression pattern = In breast cancer CD44+CD24‚àí/low cells are detectable in metastatic pleural effusions. By contrast, an increased number of CD24+ cells have been identified in distant metastases in breast cancer patients. It is possible that CD44+CD24‚àí/low cells initially metastasize and in the new site change their phenotype and undergo limited differentiation. The two-phase expression pattern hypothesis proposes two forms of cancer stem cells - stationary (SCS) and mobile (MCS). SCS are embedded in tissue and persist in differentiated areas throughout tumor progression. MCS are located at the tumor-host interface. These cells are apparently derived from SCS through the acquisition of transient EMT (Figure 7).Figure 7: The concept of migrating cancer stem cells (MSC). Stationary cancer stem cells are embedded in early carcinomas and these cells are detectable in the differentiated central area of a tumor. The important step toward malignancy is the induction of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the stationary cancer stem cells (SCS), which become mobile or migrating cancer stem cells. Stem cells divide asymmetrically. One daughter cell will begin proliferation and differentiation. The remaining MCS migrates a short distance before undergoing a new asymmetric division, or disseminates through blood vessels or lymphatic vessels and produces a metastasis. Implications CSCs have implications for cancer therapy, including for disease identification, selective drug targets, prevention of metastasis and intervention strategies. = Treatment = CSCs are inherently more resistant to chemotherapeutic agents. There are 5 main factors that contribute to this: :1. Their niche protects them from coming into contact with large concentrations of anti-cancer drugs. :2. They express various transmembrane proteins, such as MDR1 and BCRP, that pump drugs out of the cytoplasm. :3. They divide slowly, like adult stem cells tend to do, and are thus not killed by chemotherapeutic agents that target rapidly replicating cells via damaging DNA or inhibiting mitosis. :4. They upregulate DNA damage repair proteins. :5. They are characterized by an overactivation of anti- apoptotic signaling pathways. After chemotherapy treatment, surviving CSCs are able to repopulate the tumor and cause a relapse. Additional treatment targeted at removing CSCs in addition to cancerous somatic cells must be used to prevent this. = Targeting = Selectively targeting CSCs may allow treatment of aggressive, non-resectable tumors, as well as prevent metastasis and relapse. The hypothesis suggests that upon CSC elimination, cancer could regress due to differentiation and/or cell death. The fraction of tumor cells that are CSCs and therefore need to be eliminated is unclear. Studies looked for specific markers and for proteomic and genomic tumor signatures that distinguish CSCs from others. In 2009, scientists identified the compound salinomycin, which selectively reduces the proportion of breast CSCs in mice by more than 100-fold relative to Paclitaxel, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent. Some types of cancer cells can survive treatment with salinomycin through autophagy, whereby cells use acidic organelles such as lysosomes to degrade and recycle certain types of proteins. The use of autophagy inhibitors can kill cancer stem cells that survive by autophagy. The cell surface receptor interleukin-3 receptor-alpha (CD123) is overexpressed on CD34+CD38- leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) but not on normal CD34+CD38- bone marrow cells. Treating AML-engrafted NOD/SCID mice with a CD123-specific monoclonal antibody impaired LSCs homing to the bone marrow and reduced overall AML cell repopulation including the proportion of LSCs in secondary mouse recipients. A 2015 study packaged nanoparticles with miR-34a and ammonium bicarbonate and delivered them to prostate CSCs in a mouse model. Then they irradiated the area with near-infrared laser light. This caused the nanoparticles to swell three times or more in size bursting the endosomes and dispersing the RNA in the cell. miR-34a can lower the levels of CD44. A 2018 study identified inhibitors of the ALDH1A family of enzymes and showed that they could selectively deplete putative cancer stem cells in several ovarian cancer cell lines. Pathways The design of new drugs for targeting CSCs requires understanding the cellular mechanisms that regulate cell proliferation. The first advances in this area were made with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their transformed counterparts in leukemia, the disease for which the origin of CSCs is best understood. Stem cells of many organs share the same cellular pathways as leukemia-derived HSCs. A normal stem cell may be transformed into a CSC through dysregulation of the proliferation and differentiation pathways controlling it or by inducing oncoprotein activity. =BMI-1= The Polycomb group transcriptional repressor Bmi-1 was discovered as a common oncogene activated in lymphoma and later shown to regulate HSCs. The role of Bmi-1 has been illustrated in neural stem cells. The pathway appears to be active in CSCs of pediatric brain tumors. =Notch= The Notch pathway plays a role in controlling stem cell proliferation for several cell types including hematopoietic, neural and mammary SCs. Components of this pathway have been proposed to act as oncogenes in mammary and other tumors. A branch of the Notch signaling pathway that involves the transcription factor Hes3 regulates a number of cultured cells with CSC characteristics obtained from glioblastoma patients. =Sonic hedgehog and Wnt= These developmental pathways are SC regulators. Both Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and Wnt pathways are commonly hyperactivated in tumors and are necessary to sustain tumor growth. However, the Gli transcription factors that are regulated by SHH take their name from gliomas, where they are highly expressed. A degree of crosstalk exists between the two pathways and they are commonly activated together. By contrast, in colon cancer hedgehog signalling appears to antagonise Wnt. Sonic hedgehog blockers are available, such as cyclopamine. A water-soluble cyclopamine may be more effective in cancer treatment. DMAPT, a water-soluble derivative of parthenolide, induces oxidative stress and inhibits NF-Œ∫B signaling for AML (leukemia) and possibly myeloma and prostate cancer. Telomerase is a study subject in CSC physiology. GRN163L (Imetelstat) was recently started in trials to target myeloma stem cells. Wnt signaling can become independent of regular stimuli, through mutations in downstream oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that become permanently activated even though the normal receptor has not received a signal. Œ≤-catenin binds to transcription factors such as the protein TCF4 and in combination the molecules activate the necessary genes. LF3 strongly inhibits this binding in vitro, in cell lines and reduced tumor growth in mouse models. It prevented replication and reduced their ability to migrate, all without affecting healthy cells. No cancer stem cells remained after treatment. The discovery was the product of \\"rational drug design\\", involving AlphaScreens and ELISA technologies.

In standard unicast IP routing, the router forwards the packet away from the source to make progress along the distribution tree and prevent routing loops. In contrast, the router's multicast forwarding state runs more logically by organizing tables based on the reverse path, from the receiver back to the root of the distribution tree at the source of the multicast. This approach is known as reverse-path forwarding.  Multicast RPF  Multicast RPF, typically denoted simply as RPF, is used in conjunction with a multicast routing protocol such as Multicast Source Discovery Protocol or Protocol Independent Multicast to ensure loop-free forwarding of multicast packets. In multicast routing, the decision to forward traffic is based upon source address and not on destination address as in unicast routing. It does this by utilizing either a dedicated multicast routing table or, alternatively, the router's unicast routing table. When a multicast packet enters a router's interface, the router looks up the list of networks that are reachable via that interface (i.e., it checks the paths by which the packet could have arrived). If the router finds a matching routing entry for the source IP address of the multicast packet, the RPF check passes and the packet is forwarded to all other interfaces that are participating in that multicast group. If the RPF check fails, the packet is dropped. As a result, the forwarding of the packet is decided based upon the reverse path of the packet rather than the forward path. By only forwarding packets that come into the interface that also holds the routing entry for the source of the packet, loops are prevented. This is critically important in redundant multicast topologies. Because the same multicast packet could reach the same router via multiple interfaces, RPF checking is integral in the decision to forward packets or not. If the router forwarded all packets that come in interface A to interface B and it also forwarded all packets coming in interface B to interface A and both interfaces receive the same packet, this will create a routing loop where packets will be forwarded in both directions until their IP TTLs expire. Routing loops are best avoided as they unnecessarily consume network resources. The underlying assumptions of an RPF check are that, # the unicast routing table is correct and stable and, # the path used from a sender to a router and the reverse path from the router back to the sender are symmetric. If the first assumption is false, the RPF check will fail because it depends upon the router's unicast routing table as a fallback. If the second assumption is false, the RPF check would reject multicast traffic on all but the shortest path from the sender to the router which would lead to a non-optimal multicast tree. In cases where the links are unidirectional, the reverse-path approach can fail altogether.  Unicast RPF  Unicast RPF (uRPF), as defined in RFC 3704, is an evolution of the concept that traffic from known invalid networks should not be accepted on interfaces from which they should never have originated. The original idea as seen in RFC 2827 was to block traffic on an interface if it is sourced from forged IP addresses. It is a reasonable assumption for many organizations to simply disallow propagation of private addresses on their networks unless they are explicitly in use. This is a great benefit to the Internet backbone as blocking packets from obviously bogus source addresses helps to cut down on IP address spoofing which is commonly used in DoS, DDoS, and network scanning to obfuscate the source of the scan. uRPF extends this idea by utilizing the knowledge all routers must have in their routing information base (RIB) or forwarding information base (FIB) to do their primary job, to help further restrict the possible source addresses that should be seen on an interface. Packets are only forwarded if they come from a router's best route to the source of a packet. Packets coming into an interface come from valid subnetworks, as indicated by the corresponding entry in the routing table are forwarded. Packets with source addresses that could not be reached via the input interface can be dropped without disruption to normal use, as they are probably from a misconfigured or malicious source. In cases of symmetric routing, routing where packets flow both directions through the same path, and terminal networks connected via a single link, this is a safe assumption and uRPF can be implemented without many anticipated problems. Using uRPF as close as possible to the real source of traffic also stops spoofed traffic before it has any chance of using bandwidth or reaching a router that is not configured for RPF and thus inappropriately forwarded. Unfortunately, it is often the case on the larger Internet backbone that routing is asymmetric and the routing tables cannot be relied upon to point to the best route for a source to get to a router. Routing tables specify the best forward path and only in the symmetric case does that equate to the best reverse path. It is important when implementing uRPF to be aware of the potential for asymmetry to prevent accidental filtering of legitimate traffic. RFC 3704 gives more details on how to extend strict reverse-path forwarding to include some more relaxed cases that can still be of benefit while allowing for at least some asymmetry. =Strict mode= In strict mode, each incoming packet is tested against the FIB and, if the incoming interface is not the best reverse path, the packet check will fail. By default failed packets are discarded. =Feasible mode= In feasible mode, the FIB maintains alternate routes to a given IP address. If the incoming interface matches with any of the routes associated with the IP address, then the packet is forwarded. Otherwise, the packet is dropped. =Loose mode= In loose mode each incoming packet's source address is tested against the FIB. The packet is dropped only if the source address is not reachable via any interface on that router.  Unicast RPF confusion  RPF is often incorrectly defined as reverse-path filtering, particularly when it comes to unicast routing. This is an understandable misinterpretation of the acronym in that when RPF is used with unicast routing as in RFC 3704 traffic is either permitted or denied based upon the RPF check passing or failing. The thought being that traffic is denied if it fails the RPF check and is therefore filtered, however as per RFC 3704 the correct interpretation is that traffic is forwarded if it passes the RPF check. Several examples of the proper usage can be seen in documents by Juniper, Cisco, OpenBSD, and most importantly RFC 3704 which defines the use of RPF with unicast. While uRPF is used as an ingress filtering mechanism, it is affected by reverse-path forwarding. Comparison to reverse-path filtering Reverse path filters are typically used to disable asymmetric routing where an IP application has a different incoming and outgoing routing path. Reverse path filtering is a Linux Kernel feature. So major functionality is to prevent packet entering from one interface leaving via the other interfaces. Reverse-path Filtering is a feature of the Linux Kernel, but reverse-path forwarding is the protocol of the IP multicast routing.professional Linux- 1 May 2018: rp_filter and LPIC-3 Linux Security  professional Linux software developmentCISCO Security Research & Operations- 3 June 2015: Understanding Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding  Cisco -unicast-reverse-path-forwarding  See also  * Flooding (computer networking) Notes References  External links  * RFC 2827 * RFC 3704 * Juniper - Configuring uRPF * Brocade - Configuring uRPF * Cisco - Understanding uRPF * Multicast Reverse Forwarding(RPF) * OpenBSD - Enabling uRPF in pf * Linux - Enabling RPF in kernel * Juniper Networks on multicast RPF Category:Routing ","title":"Reverse-path forwarding"},{"id":"2448963","text":"Nebraska Public Power District (NPPD) is the largest electric utility in the state of Nebraska, serving all or parts of 91 (of 93) counties. It was formed on January 1, 1970, when Consumers Public Power District, Platte Valley Public Power and Irrigation District (PVPPID) and Nebraska Public Power System merged to become Nebraska Public Power District. NPPD's predecessors were created through the efforts of the Nebraska legislature and financial agent Guy L. Myers as part of a system where all the investor-owned utilities operating in the state of Nebraska (Nebraska Power Co., Central Power Co., Southern Nebraska Power Co., et al.) were condemned and their properties turned over to 'public power districts' being created at the time (early 1940s). NPPD is a public corporation and political subdivision of the state of Nebraska. The utility is governed by an 11-member Board of Directors, who are popularly elected from NPPD's chartered territory. NPPD's revenue is mainly derived from wholesale power supply agreements with 52 cities/villages and 25 rural public power districts and rural cooperatives. NPPD also serves about 79 communities directly at the retail level. Over of transmission lines make up the NPPD electrical grid system, which delivers power to about one million customers. NPPD's corporate headquarters is located in Columbus, Nebraska.

NPPD also purchases electricity from the Western Area Power Administration, which is operated by the United States Department of Energy. Irrigation & Recreation NPPD also operates the intricate network of irrigation canals, dams and reservoirs along a stretch of the Platte River which help power its hydro plants. In addition to the essential role the water plays in irrigating farmland and generating electricity in the area, the reservoir system provides fishing, hunting and boating opportunities for all Nebraskans. =Lake Maloney= Lake Maloney is located along Highway 83, five miles (8 km) south of the Interstate 80 exit at North Platte, Neb. Lake Maloney is used to regulate the flow of water for generating electricity at NPPD's nearby North Platte Hydro facility. The reservoir is a popular place for fishing, skiing and boating. A handicap-accessible fishing pier, fish-cleaning station and 57 camping pads with electrical hookups are available at the lake's Inlet Recreation Area. Lake Maloney's Outlet Recreation Area has camp sites, a trailer dump station, two boat ramp/docks, a fish-cleaning station and a shower house. Primitive camp sites are also available at several locations around the lake, and an 18-hole golf course is nearby. Entry to the lake requires a day or season pass from the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission. Camping fees are posted. =Lake Ogallala/Sutherland Supply Canal= Lake Ogallala and the Sutherland Supply Canal are among the top trout fisheries in the state. The area is also one of the best places in the nation for viewing a wide variety of native and migratory birds, including bald eagles. The lake is formed by the Keystone Dam on the North Platte River. Canal roads can be accessed east from Highway 61 or north from U.S. 30 at Roscoe and Paxton. Because of steep banks and swift water, no wading, boating or watercraft are permitted in the canal. Anglers fishing from the banks are recommended to wear life jackets. Emergency buoys with ropes are location along the canal. This is a day-use area; no overnight camping is allowed. =Sutherland Reservoir= The Sutherland Reservoir is a lake located three miles (5 km) south of the Interstate 80 Exit at Sutherland, Neb. NPPD owns and manages the Sutherland Reservoir, part of its hydropower system. Nebraska Game and Parks Commission (NGPC) oversees most of the recreation areas at the lake. A day or season pass is required for entry into NGPC areas. Primitive campsites are located on the east and west sides of the lake, while a private camping area with electrical hook-ups and a nine-hole golf course are located along the north shore. Four boat launching ramps and two swimming areas are available. NPPD maintains a roost and perch tree protection program for eagles and, during the winter months, bird watchers can observe numerous wintering American Bald Eagles. =North Platte Trail= In North Platte, the city's riding and hiking path continues on the south side of town along NPPD's North Platte Hydro tailrace canal. Trail users travel under Interstate 80 on a low-water bridge along the canal. Hikers and bikers pass along the grass and gravel canal maintenance road to State Farm Road where the route continues west. From the bridge, trail users receive a fine view of the North Platte Hydro. Fishing is allowed north of the bridge, but not immediately downstream of the North Platte Hydro. Boaters and swimmers are restricted from the tailrace canal. =Kearney Canal Trail= Kearney Dam, Kearney, Nebraska, USA The City of Kearney and Buffalo County Parks and Recreation Department constructed an -wide concrete trail along NPPD's Kearney Canal in 1996. The scenic corridor is a gradual downhill grade from Cottonmill Park to the University of Nebraska at Kearney campus. The -long canal was built in the 1880s to divert Platte River water for irrigation and electrical generation. Cottonmill Lake once served as a reservoir for a cotton mill and now is a city park. The Kearney Dam & Hydro date to 1889. The 1.485-megawatt hydro-generator in the turret-looking tower was refurbished by NPPD in 1996. Access to NPPD's dam and hydro areas near the trail is restricted with no swimming or boating allowed.

The novel took Rushdie four years to write, and was initially published on 6 September 2005 by Jonathan Cape. Shalimar the Clown derives its name from Shalimar Gardens, in the vicinity of Srinagar. Srinagar is one of several Mughal Gardens, which were laid out in several parts of South Asian under Mughal rule. Shalimar is also the name of one of the characters featured in the novel. Shalimar the Clown won the 2005 Vodafone Crossword Book Award and was one of the finalists for the 2005 Whitbread Book Awards. Setting The novel is based partly in a small town in the region of Kashmir. The town itself is imaginary, but it is located in an accurate geographic location not far from Srinagar. The title refers to a character in the story, a Kashmiri villager named Shalimar, who performs a tightrope act for the amusement of the other villagers. Plot summary The central character, India, is the illegitimate child of a former United States ambassador to India, Maximilian Ophuls. Although a number of narratives and incidents in the novel revolve around Kashmir, the novel opens in Los Angeles. Max Ophuls, a US diplomat who has worked in the Kashmir Valley, is murdered by his former chauffeur, Shalimar. Several flashbacks take the readers to the past, and one learns that Shalimar was once full of affection, love and laughter. He lived in the fictional Kashmiri village of Pachigam. His skill on the tight rope has earned him renown in his village and the nickname Shalimar the clown. At a young age, he falls in love with a beautiful Kashmiri Pandit girl, named Boonyi. The village elders agree to the marriage and all seems fine, except that Boonyi doesn't want to remain stuck in this small village. Things come to a head when Maximilian comes to the village, sees Boonyi dance, and becomes enamored of her. With the help of his assistant, he gets her a flat in Delhi, and an affair blossoms. A scandal erupts when Boonyi gets pregnant and Max is forced to return. The child, India, is brought to England by Maximilian's wife. Shalimar was deeply in love with Boonyi and couldn't bear her betrayal. He devotes the rest of his life to taking revenge on the people that were the cause of his unhappiness. For this purpose he joins up with various Jihadi organisations and becomes a renowned assassin. Maximilian, the son of Ashkenazi Jews, was raised in France. Following the death of his parents in a Nazi concentration camp, he becomes a hero of the French resistance. A fictionalised account of the Bugatti automobile company plays a role in his escape from the Nazis. Following the war, he marries a British aristocrat, and eventually becomes American ambassador to India. This appointment eventually leads to his unspecified role in relation to American counter-terrorism. The appointment is more important than his ambassadorship, but his exact role is left vague. Shalimar receives training from insurgent groups in Afghanistan and the Philippines, and leaves for the USA. He murders Max on the day he resigns as his driver. Shalimar evades the authorities and eventually returns to India's home, with the intention of killing her. The story portrays the paradise that once was Kashmir, and how the politics of the sub-continent ripped apart the lives of those caught in the middle of the battleground. Adaptations The novel was adapted as an opera, with music by Jack Perla and a libretto by Rajiv Joseph, which premiered at Opera Theater of St. Louis in 2016. The principal roles were taken by Sean Panikkar, Andriana Chuchman, Gregory Dahl, and Katharine Goeldner; smaller parts were played by Aubrey Allicock and Thomas Hammons, among others. The performance was conducted by Jayce Ogren. A recording of the opera was subsequently released by Albany Records.

It was the largest blackout in the series of blackouts in 2003, involving about 56 million people. Causes Power went off at about 03:20 hrs. local time on 28 September 2003. Initial reports from Italy's electricity supplier, GRTN, stated that the power line which supplied electricity to Italy from Switzerland was damaged by storms, causing it to trip; and also that the two 400 kV power lines between France and Italy tripped due to sudden increased demand from those two power lines. Later, it has been shown that the trip of the first line from Switzerland - the so- called \\"Lukmanier\\" line - was caused by a tree flashover. The trigger of the Italian blackout was insufficient trimming of bushes and trees below HV overhead lines. The cascading effect disrupted power flow to Italy from the two main exporting countries France and Switzerland. GRTN lost control of the grid in the next 4 seconds, with the lines to neighbouring countries tripped one by one amid the cascading effect. Swiss electricity company ATEL later concurred that a power line between Switzerland and Italy went out for a few hours. Frequency dropped down to 49 Hz, due to the loss of import power. Within the next 2,5 minutes, frequency went further down until the under- frequency threshold of 47,5 Hz was hit and all generators were tripped according to the under-frequency protection settings. The reason for the blackout was that during this phase the under-voltage load shedding (UVLS) could not compensate the additional loss of generation, when ca. 7,5 GW of distributed power plants tripped during under-frequency operation (cf. figure \\"Frequency behavior in Italy in the transitory period\\", UCTE report, April 2004, p. 115). Effects The night of 27 September 2003 is the night of the annual overnight Nuit Blanche in Rome, the capital of Italy. Thus, many people were on the streets and all public transportation were still operating at the time of the blackout (at about 3:00 on 28 September 2003) despite the fact that it was very late at night. The blackout caused the carnival to end early. Several hundred people were trapped in underground trains. Coupled with heavy rain at the time, many people spent the night sleeping in train stations and on streets in Rome. Throughout Italy, 110 trains were cancelled, with 30,000 people stranded on trains in the railway network. All flights in Italy were also cancelled. Police described the scene as chaos but there were no serious accidents. The blackout did not spread further to neighboring countries, such as Austria, Slovenia and Croatia, which are connected to Italy. Only part of the Geneva Canton of Switzerland suffered a power outage for three hours. Restoration of service After three hours, energy was restored in northern regions. Electricity was restored gradually in most places, and in most cities electricity was powered on again during the morning. Rolling blackouts continued to affect about 5% of the population on the next two days (29‚Äì30 September) as the electricity company GRTN continued its effort to restore supply. Official report The final report of the investigation committee on the 28 September 2003 blackout in Italy was published in April 2004 by UCTE. Scientific research Researchers in physics and complex networks have modelled the 2003 Italy blackout as a cascade of failures in interdependent networks. Several nodes in the network of power stations failed, causing a failure of the Internet communication network, which in turn caused a further breakdown of power stations. The goal of research was to understand how to build more robust networks.Sergey V. Buldyrev, Roni Parshani, Gerald Paul, H. Eugene Stanley & Shlomo Havlin.

They are part of the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport network.  History  The lines were built by the Cathcart District Railway (Cathcart Circle) and the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway (Newton and Neilston lines). The first part opened on 1 March 1886Glasgow Herald, 1 March 1886 as a double line from Glasgow Central to then single to Cathcart, doubled on 26 May 1886.The People's History of Glasgow, 1899 The circular route back to Central station via Shawlands and Maxwell Park was completed on 2 April 1894. The Newton and Neilston branches were built to provide a through route from the Lanarkshire coalfields to ports such as Ardrossan on the Ayrshire coast. There is still a junction with other lines at Newton, but the track beyond Neilston has been lifted. The lines originally carried significant amounts of freight, but commuter trains are the only regular users now. Football Specials sometimes run to Mount Florida and for major matches at Hampden Park. When the lines were built much of the land around them was open countryside. The existence of a commuter railway was a major factor in the development of Glasgow's southern suburbs, although until electrification in 1962 there was virtually no passenger service beyond KirkhillBR Scottish Region timetable September 1961 by this route. On weekdays the services have provided a vital transport link for school pupils and college students at nearby schools and higher education establishments, contributing to passenger numbers on top of the commuter traffic. The lines under British Railways were electrified on Monday 28 May 1962 at the standard 25 kV AC, but originally 6.25 kV between and Mount Florida because of limited clearances. The \\"Blue Trains\\", units, which had dual voltage capability, replaced steam trains and early diesel units. There was a trial run on the previous day.,Evening Times, Glasgow, 28 May 1962 and over 5,500 passengers were reported as using the new trains in their first morning rush hour.  Constituent lines  The lines comprise the following lines: = Cathcart Circle = Built by the Cathcart District Railway. = Newton Line = Built by the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway. Diverges from the Circle via a dive under junction south of and at Cathcart South Junction (south of ). The link at Cathcart South junction was put in place during electrification. = Neilston Line = Built by the L&AR.; Diverges from the Circle at .  Passenger services  = Following electrification in 1962 = Round the west side of the Circle onto the L&AR; lines eastbound, terminating at . East side services ran to Newton, with many extended to via the Clydesdale Junction Railway. The basic service every 30 minutes was Glasgow Central to Neilston via Mount Florida; Central to Motherwell via Mount Florida; Glasgow Central to Kirkhill via Maxwell Park; and Cathcart Circle (Inner and Outer). = West Coast Main Line electrification 1974 = This included the Hamilton Circle and resulted in east side services terminating at Newton. Peak services from east and west sides operated to Motherwell via Blantyre and Hamilton. = Argyle Line opening in 1979 = The major change being the extension of west side services from Kirkhill to Newton. Until May 1984 there were four trains an hour on the Newton branch (two via Maxwell Park and two via Queen's Park) and two trains an hour in each direction around the Circle, in addition to the services on the Neilston branch. From May 1984, both the Newton and Neilston services remained 2 per hour, none turned back at Kirkhill and only one ran the full circle each way. GBTT May 1984 = 2006/07 = Services were operated by First ScotRail, with most services using electric multiple units, although Class 318s and Class 334s (Juniper units) made occasional appearances on the line. = 2014 = The basic service (Monday to Sunday) is every 30 minutes from Glasgow Central to Neilston via Mount Florida and every hour from Glasgow Central to Newton via Mount Florida, Glasgow Central to Newton via Maxwell Park and the inner and outer Circle service (does not operate on Sundays). This frequency gives a 30-minute service on the west side of the Circle, Neilston and Newton branches, three trains per hour at Cathcart and four trains per hour between Glasgow Central and Mount Florida. These service levels are less than those of the 1960s. At peak times the above services combine to have trains running approximately every 5‚Äì10 minutes between Glasgow Central and Cathcart, where line capacity permits. Several trains are formed of the maximum six cars at these times. Commuter levels on this line are quite high and therefore a high density service is required at such busy periods.  Rolling stock  The \\"Blue Trains\\" (pictured at Kirkhill railway station) were introduced on the Cathcart Circle upon electrification, surviving until 2002. Upon electrification in 1962, Class 303s. Following electrification of the Inverclyde Line in 1967, Class 311 units were also used. Following the introduction of the Class 318 in 1986, they made occasional trips onto the Circle. The Class 311 were withdrawn in 1990, and following the introduction of the the Class 303 were withdrawn in 2002 and a major redeployment of the fleet took place, resulting in the Class 314s taking over the line, supplemented occasionally by Classes 318 and 334. In 2014 Class 314s primarily operated the Circle (including Newton, Neilston services). During peak hours Class 380s are also used on the Circle route only. From December 2016, Class 320s were introduced to the line, working the Circle and Newton via Maxwell Park routes to permit an increase in Class 314 workings on the Inverclyde Line. This was due to a number of Class 380s being reserved for driver training on the newly electrified Glasgow to Edinburgh via Falkirk High route. From the December 2018 timetable change, Class 380s began operating most Neilston services, along with some Circle an Newton services. From February 2019, Class 385s began operating some Circle and Newton services.  Future  = Light rail conversion = There have also been proposals to convert the lines to a tram line, but never beyond the initial suggestion stage. Most recently, in December 2008 Transport Scotland's Strategic Transport Projects Review suggested an upgrade of the Circle to light rail as part of a wider light rail network for Glasgow, incorporating both new lines and re-purposed older alignments. If taken forward, this proposal was supposed to have been implemented during the period 2012 - 2022, in line with the scope of the strategic review.

It is located down the street from Wynn Las Vegas, behind the former site of the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on , near the Fashion Show Mall, and features both non-residential hotel condominiums and residential condominiums. The exterior glass is infused with gold. Tower 1 opened on March 31, 2008, with 1,282 rooms. It has two restaurants: DJT, the developer's initials, and a poolside restaurant, H2(eau).Jen Leo, Las Vegas Trump Tower opens today, Los Angeles Times, March 31, 2008. Trump announced that a second, identical tower would be built next to the first tower, but the plan was suspended after the mid-2000s recession. It is Las Vegas's tallest residential building at . In September 2012, the Trump Organization announced that it sold roughly 300 condominium units in Trump International Hotel Las Vegas to Hilton Worldwide's timeshare division, Hilton Grand Vacations. History In April 2002, Phil Ruffin announced that he had partnered with Donald Trump to build Trump Tower Las Vegas, a $300 million 60-story condominium tower with 300 units and the possibility of a casino, to be constructed on Fashion Show Drive, near Ruffin's New Frontier Hotel and Casino. Trump had initially approached Ruffin two years earlier about developing a property on or near the Las Vegas Strip. Construction on Trump Tower Las Vegas was to begin in six to seven months, and was expected to last approximately 18 months. In August 2003, Ruffin said the tower had been decreased to 43 stories and was expected to cost $272 million. In November 2003, Trump denied that the project had been delayed or that it was suffering from a lack of financing. Trump also said he was considering \\"something on a larger scale\\" for the project. In July 2004, Ruffin said the project had been delayed up to that point because of other business ventures, including Trump's reality television show, The Apprentice. That month, Trump and Ruffin announced revised plans for Trump International Hotel and Tower, a $300 million condominium-hotel with over 1,000 units. Although Trump held a Nevada gaming license, he chose not to include a casino on the property. Donald Trump's son Eric Trump later said, \\"We have no problem getting a gaming license, but we wanted to do something different here. We wanted a true luxury resort experience. It's hard to have a high-quality product when you walk into 'ding, ding, ding' and there are people walking around in Hawaiian shirts with big plastic drink mugs.\\" Ruffin appeared in an October 2004 episode of The Apprentice to sign a $300 million deal with Trump regarding the project. The project was referenced again in the show's second-season finale, when winner Kelly Perdew was offered a job at the property. Jack Wishna, who introduced Trump to Ruffin, was a minority partner in the project. In January 2005, the project was valued at $1 billion. Groundbreaking was initially scheduled for May 2005, with completion expected by the end of 2006. By May 2005, all of the tower's 1,282 condominium units had been reserved by prospective buyers. Trump and Ruffin held a groundbreaking ceremony for the project on July 12, 2005. The Las Vegas Review-Journal wrote that the event was \\"really a ribbon-cutting and photo opportunity\\". News programs such as Access Hollywood and Extra provided coverage of the event, which was attended by approximately 300 state and local government representatives, as well as Carolyn Goodman, showgirls, Steve Wynn and his wife Elaine Wynn, and Miss USA 2005 winner Chelsea Cooley. Condominium units went on sale the same day with the opening of a $3 million temporary sales center at the corner of South Las Vegas Boulevard and Fashion Show Drive, in front of the New Frontier. The building was , and featured a 10-foot replica of the tower. That month, an NBA team was in negotiations to purchase an entire floor of the tower, while Trump was considering an alternative version of The Apprentice that would involve the tower. Construction was expected to begin by the end of that summer, and was expected to last 24 to 30 months. Construction began in November 2005, when the building's foundation was poured. After the completion of a 36,000-square-foot recreational deck in March 2006, an average of 800 workers constructed one new floor for the tower approximately every six days. The tower was topped out on May 25, 2007. The project was constructed at a cost of $500 million, on of land that was part of the rear parking lot for the New Frontier. The project was designed by Bergman, Walls & Associates and built by Perini Building Company. Trump Hotel Las Vegas opened on March 31, 2008. An opening ceremony was held by Trump and Ruffin on April 11, 2008. By October 2008, only 21 percent of condo unit sales had closed, as potential buyers had trouble securing mortgages. , Eric Trump oversees operations at the tower. On December 4‚Äì5, 2015, employees voted in favor of unionizing the hotel property. It was organized by the Bartenders Union and the Culinary Workers Union and supervised by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) under the Obama administration. Donald Trump owns a penthouse on the 61st floor. =Second tower= By April 2005, a second, identical 64-story tower was being planned. Sales of the second tower were planned to begin by the end of 2005, with a 35 percent increase in prices from the first tower. In November 2005, the second tower was planned to open sometime in 2009. In April 2007, the second tower was the subject of an episode of The Apprentice in which the show's candidates were tasked with creating a marketing program for the new tower. Condo units for the tower went on sale the next day. Trump said the tower would be nearly identical to the first tower, and would also include 1,282 units. Because of rising construction expenses, the second tower was expected to cost $625 million, which would have brought the total cost of Trump International Hotel and Tower to $1.1 billion. This number was later reported to be $1.2 billion in February 2008, at which point the second tower was expected to begin construction at the end of the year. In April 2008, Trump said he had not decided on a start date for the second tower, choosing to wait until all sales had closed on the first tower's rooms. At that time, reservations were still being accepted for the second tower's units. The second tower was ultimately put on hold because of bad credit markets.

He was friendly with colonial governor Sir James Douglas and John Sebastian Helmcken. Ker was the auditor general of the first Colony of British Columbia and also acted as auditor general of the Colony of Vancouver Island. When the two colonies united in 1866, he continued in the position of auditor general. Upon Canadian Confederation in 1867, he was appointed to the position of Dominion paymaster general. He died in Victoria, British Columbia of exposure during a snowstorm. The Ker Memorial Wing of the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria is named in his honour.

Although the GUI was lauded in the press, the application was so slow that it became something of a joke in the industry. Sales were dismal, and Ashton-Tate eventually decided to give up on dBASE Mac and instead port dBASE IV to the Mac, complete with a DOS-like interface. The product was then sold to a series of 3rd party developers, but they had little success and it disappeared from the market in the mid-1990s. History =Genesis= dBASE Mac started life at a 3rd party developer, DigiCorp, a small two-person company in Salt Lake City. They had attempted to market it through other companies in 1984 as Hayden: Base via Hayden Software, a Mac publisher,BusinessWeek, 1985, p. 86 TheBaseDennis Cohen, \\"A Little Professional History\\" and then ¬∞Base (Dot-Base, referring to a part of its internal syntax), but the product was not really ready and the deals fell through. Just before Christmas 1984, Ashton-Tate started negotiations with the developers, completing the deal early 1985.\\"Ashton-Tate Buys Multimate in Record Deal\\" (sidebar), InfoWorld, 12 August 1985, pg. 15 The developers moved to A-T's Glendale Development Center (home of the PC versions of dBASE development) early in 1985. Development resumed in May, referred to by the code-name Dottie, referring to the earlier Dot-Base naming. =Changing priorities= At first the idea was to produce something similar to DigiCorp's original design, releasing a 1.0 in early 1986 and then following with a major upgrade late that year. However the product quickly became fouled in Ashton- Tate's management, who used it as a dumping ground for every buzzword feature that came along. Eventually the original 1.0 design was abandoned and the decision was made to move directly to what was to have been the 2.0 release, the most notable change being to include an object oriented programming language. Sometime during this period, management saw the product as a migration path for all versions of dBASE, using the Mac as a testing ground before releasing it on the PC as well, thereby replacing their now-ageing dBASE core with a fully GUI-hosted object-oriented database. Apple had long evangelized Ashton-Tate on developing for the Mac, considering them to be one of the \\"big players\\" they needed to legitimize the Mac marketplace. Although Apple's upper management remained committed to this vision, after waiting three years since the release of the Mac, others in the company were becoming increasingly frustrated with the seemingly never ending development cycles. Things came to a head when Guy Kawasaki convinced Apple to option a new advanced database program then known as \\"Silver Surfer\\". Ashton-Tate threatened to stop all Mac development, and Apple quickly acquiesced and dropped their option. Kawasaki responded by starting his own company and marketing the product as 4th Dimension. Another delay followed as Ashton-Tate asked for many tweaks and new features to ensure dBASE Mac would compete with this new and very competitive product. By late 1986 the product was starting to gel, about the time the original 2.0 would have shipped. Management decided to market it as dBASE Mac, even though it had nothing in common with its PC counterpart. The developers were worried that customers would not be impressed with getting a product that was called dBASE only to find it didn't even work with the DOS version. In order to provide some commonality the system could use dBASE databases by building an additional external index file, but it still required the users to re-build their application logic and forms in the new system. =Release and reviews= The product finally shipped in the summer of 1987, just before MacWorld Boston.This document claims the release date was September 1987. This seems to be widely quoted, but this date disagrees with other sources. As the developers had feared, reviewers universally panned the product because it did not interact directly with dBASE on the PC. Don Crabb's review in InfoWorld was succinct, noting that \\"DBase Mac is not DBase for the Mac\\". Reviewers also universally noted the slow performance, one going so far to state it was difficult to tell if the program was crashed, which it did a lot, or was simply taking a long time to complete a task. Another pointed out that even the included example programs were uselessly slow, noting \\"As for the video store application, customers would have time to view the movie and return the tape in the time it took dBASE Mac to update records.\\" A 1.01 version fixing most of the bugs was released in April 1988, but by this time the damage was done and 4th Dimension was garnering critical praise. The company abandoned the idea of using the Mac as a testing ground for all future versions of the system, dooming it to remain an orphan. A year later Ashton-Tate gave up on the product entirely, and decided to instead port their latest PC database, dBASE IV, to the Mac.Daniel Farber, \\"A-T back to basics with Mac dBASE IV\\", MacWEEK, 24 April 1990 =3rd party development= Ashton-Tate sold off the rights for dBASE Mac in June 1990 to a former dBASE Mac user who formed New Era Software Group to continue development. At the time they quoted 35,000 users.Henry Norr, \\"dBASE Mac to enter New Era\\", MacWEEK, 31 July 1990 New Era released an update in late November as nuBASE Mac 1.3. 1.3 proved to be considerably more stable and faster than the Ashton-Tate versions, although this did little to help given the product's reputation, which the press considered undeserved by this point.Don Crabb, \\"nuBASE: a new face on old dBASE Mac\\", MacWEEK, 24 September 1991 1.3 also added the ability for the product to call HyperCard XCMD's, which allowed it to use the variety of plugins from the HyperCard world. In late 1991 the company suffered a major theft which slowed development of the follow-up version, originally planned to be a 2.0. Instead, in the spring of 1992 they released a \\"32-bit clean\\" nuBASE Pro 1.5, which allowed it to run on Apple's latest operating systems and PowerMac machines. At the same time the product was modified to allow it to act as a pure front-end to a new nuBASE LAN Manager 1.5 server. Although what happened at this point is not clear, either New Era folded or changed names. The new release, renamed to nuBASE Pro 1.5, followed from Tactic Software. Once again the rights changed hands, this time to Dolphin Software who released a version as nuBase Pro 2.0 in 1995.Clifford Colby \\"Swimming With the Big Fish\\", MacWEEK, 25 June 1995 Their plans to port it to Windows went nowhere, and once again the product disappeared, the rights reverting to the original author from the 1980s. =Death= Sales of the product in the post Ashton-Tate era appear to have been close to zero, and the product is still best remembered under its original name. In this form it has been called a \\"killer app\\", but in a non- traditional sense that it helped kill the company, and the reputation of Apple with it.Peter Coffee, \\"25 Killer Apps of All Time\\" dBASE Mac\\", eWeek Meanwhile, dBASE IV turned out to be a huge disaster on the PC causing Ashton- Tate to struggle financially. The company was purchased by Borland in 1991, and development of all of Ashton-Tate's Mac products ended. Description In common with most database applications today, dBASE Mac had two basic \\"modes\\", one for designing the database itself, and another for building forms to interact with it. In this case dBASE Mac was lauded for both, many describing it as \\"the right way to do a Mac database\\".

A merchant, in the 1830s he helped pioneer trade between United States interests in Charleston and those in Texas and Mexico. Early life and education Abraham Labatt was a Sephardic Jew born in Charleston, South Carolina. His parents were David C. Labatt and Catherine Cohen (1773-1846), who came to Charleston by the time of the 1800 census having emigrated from Spain and Portugal, via Germany, France, the Netherlands and England. Career As a young man, Labatt was one of the founders and first settlers of Cheraw, South Carolina, where he joined a Masonic Lodge in 1823. In 1825, Labatt helped organize the Reform congregation in Charleston, the first in the United States.Diana J. Kleiner, \\"LABATT, ABRAHAM COHEN\\", Handbook of Texas Online, Published by the Texas State Historical Association, accessed 2 November 2012 A few years later, he moved with his young family to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he worked as a merchant and trader. He was appointed post master of a small town in what was then Mecklenburg County and is now believed to be Monroe, North Carolina by US President Andrew Jackson, which he named Jacksonville (not to be confused with Jacksonville, North Carolina). In 1827 he purchased large plots of land there and in 1830 and 1832 he was granted powers of attorney by his father-in-law Samuel Hyams to sell more land in Mecklenburg and two slaves named Sandy and Gabriel that Hyams owned. On 3 November 1829 he placed an advertisement in the Western Carolinian for a \\"House of Accommodation\\", believed to be same place as Labatt's Crossroads, where Union County's first court sat.Thomas, George, \\"The Making of Monroe\\", rockyrivernc.com accessed 7 September 2020 In 1831 he moved to New Orleans, where he engaged in mercantile pursuits. In that city, he was one of the founders of the first Jewish congregations in Louisiana, which became known as the Portuguese Jewish Nefutzot Yehudah congregation (or Portuguese Synagogue). (In 1870, its rabbi visited Galveston to dedicate the cornerstone of the first synagogue of Congregation B'nai Israel.) Labatt was also a firefighter and was the secretary and a founder of the Firemen's Charitable Association of New Orleans, which was established in 1832. In 1831, Labatt visited Velasco, Texas, then part of Mexico, which had achieved independence in 1821, to explore opportunities for international trade. A settlement had just been started based on a trading post. He visited again in 1837 as supercargo of the steamship Columbia. This was the first cargo ship to trade between the U.S., via Charleston, and Texas (by then an independent republic) and Mexico. Following the Gold Rush of 1849, Labatt went to California as a merchant, along with hundreds of thousands of other migrants. He also served as the first president of Congregation Emanu-El (San Francisco) in April 1851., \\"Henry J. Labatt: Influential Early Pioneer Jewish Attorney of San Francisco\\", Jewish Museum of the American West, March 1, 2013, accessed 7 September 2020 One of the founders of the San Francisco synagogue Shearith Israel, he laid its foundation-stone in 1856.

It aired from 1972 to August 30, 1986 and was the original television show of the WWF. Originally produced under the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) banner, Championship Wrestling featured all the stars of the WWF, interviews and championship matches. It was the flagship program of the WWWF/WWF's syndicated programming until it was replaced by Superstars of Wrestling in 1986. History = Run in syndication = This was the first WWF program to be shown on national broadcast television. Vince McMahon built the syndicated network in part by persuading local stations to pay for the rights to air the program. Stations like KPLR-TV in St. Louis and KHJ-TV (now KCAL) in Los Angeles reportedly paid $100,000 to air the show.Sports Illustrated, March 18, 1985 issue, Hogan on the cover In its early years, the show was taped at the Philadelphia Arena and later at the Allentown Agricultural Hall in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Typically, three weeks of television were taped in one night. The final taping in Allentown took place on June 19, 1984, with the episodes airing June 30, July 7, and July 14. The tapings then moved to the Mid-Hudson Civic Center in Poughkeepsie, New York until the final taping took place on August 5, 1986, with the final episode airing on August 30. The final taping featured the coronation of King Harley Race. The following week, WWF Superstars of Wrestling replaced Championship Wrestling as the WWF's new flagship syndicated program. In contrast to Championship Wrestling, the tapings for Superstars of Wrestling moved around the country and took place at larger arenas. = Announcers = *Vince McMahon and Antonino Rocca (1972-1976) *Vince McMahon and Bruno Sammartino (1976-1980) *Vince McMahon and Pat Patterson (1980‚Äì1983) (Bruno Sammartino occasionally substituted for Patterson) *Vince McMahon and \\"Mean\\" Gene Okerlund (1984) *Vince McMahon and Tony Garea (1984) *Vince McMahon and \\"Living Legend\\" Bruno Sammartino (1984‚Äì1986) (Jesse \\"The Body\\" Ventura occasionally substituted for Sammartino) Ray Stevens and Andre the Giant both guested as announcers alongside McMahon. The longtime ring announcer was Joe McHugh, who did the ring announcing and introductions of everyone on staff at the beginning of every broadcast since the 1970s. He would retire in 1984, being replaced by Howard Finkel. Buddy Wagner preceded McHugh in the mid-70s when the cards were taped at the Philadelphia Arena. = Interviewers = The interviewer position was filled mostly by McMahon with Pat Patterson also assisting in some cases, until the hire of Gene Okerlund in 1984 which gave him the full-time slot of interviewing wrestlers backstage or at ringside. Jack Reynolds, Freddie Miller, Kal Rudman, and Ken Resnick also did interviews alongside Okerlund until the show's cancellation in 1986. *Vince McMahon (1972‚Äì83) *Pat Patterson (1980‚Äì83) *Gene Okerlund (1984‚Äì86) *Freddie Miller (1984‚Äì85) *Jack Reynolds (1984‚Äì85) *Kal Rudman (1984‚Äì85) *Ken Resnick (1986) = Theme music = Probably the most well-remembered theme music of Championship Wrestling is \\"Scheherazade\\" by jazz trumpeter Maynard Ferguson. This instrumental piece was used from 1978 until well into 1981. From March 1984 to 1986, an instrumental version of Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" was used. This song was accompanied by the image footage of Hulk Hogan winning the WWF title from The Iron Sheik. Other theme music included \\"Cruise Control\\" by the Dixie Dregs (Oct. 1981‚ÄîMarch 1984) with footage of Bob Backlund being mobbed and picked up by jubilant fans while holding up the Championship belt. The instrumental ‚ÄúCrater‚Äù by Alan Parker was used during the championship reign of Superstar Billy Graham, and accompanied a slow- motion montage in which both he and Bruno Sammartino were featured prominently. \\"One Fine Morning\\" by Canadian jazz-rock ensemble Lighthouse was also used (approx. 1974‚Äì1975). Various pop music was used for commercial bumpers starting in late 1982, including \\"Start Me Up\\" by The Rolling Stones, \\"Dirty Laundry\\" by Don Henley, \\"Private Eyes\\" and \\"Out of Touch\\" by Daryl Hall & John Oates, \\"Walk of Life\\" by Dire Straits, \\"She Bop\\" and \\"Money Changes Everything\\" by Cyndi Lauper, \\"Conga\\" by Miami Sound Machine, \\"Freeway of Love\\" by Aretha Franklin, \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" by Tears for Fears, \\"Things Can Only Get Better\\" by Howard Jones, and \\"The Power of Love\\" and \\"Back in Time\\" by Huey Lewis and the News. = International Broadcasts = The inaugural WrestleMania was broadcast in Australia in May 1985 on the Ten Network. Ten had a tentative deal in place with the WWF to then show WWF Championship Wrestling on a weekly basis depending on the ratings for Wrestlemania. With Wrestlemania being a ratings success, Ten brought weekly professional wrestling back to Australian television for the first time since the late 1970s and the show was telecast on Monday nights, usually in the 10:30 or 11 PM time slot.

It is found throughout Southeast Asia, and is the most common cause of human malaria in Malaysia. Like other Plasmodium species, P. knowlesi has a life cycle that requires infection of both a mosquito and a warm-blooded host. While the natural warm-blooded hosts of P. knowlesi are likely various Old World monkeys, humans can be infected by P. knowlesi if they are fed upon by infected mosquitoes. P. knowlesi is a eukaryote in the phylum Apicomplexa, genus Plasmodium, and subgenus Plasmodium. It is most closely related to the human parasite Plasmodium vivax as well as other Plasmodium species that infect non-human primates. Humans infected with P. knowlesi can develop uncomplicated or severe malaria similar to that caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Diagnosis of P. knowlesi infection is challenging as P. knowlesi very closely resembles other species that infect humans. Treatment is similar to other types of malaria, with chloroquine or artemisinin combination therapy typically recommended. P. knowlesi malaria is an emerging disease previously thought to be rare in humans, but increasingly recognized as a major health burden in Southeast Asia. P. knowlesi was first described as a distinct species and as a potential cause of human malaria in 1932. It was briefly used in the early 20th century to cause fever as a treatment for neurosyphilis. In the mid-20th century, P. knowlesi became popular as a tool for studying Plasmodium biology and was used for basic research, vaccine research, and drug development. P. knowlesi is still used as a laboratory model for malaria, as it readily infects the model primate the rhesus macaque, and can be grown in cell culture in human or macaque blood. Life cycle A diagram of the life cycle of Plasmodium species that infect humans Like other Plasmodium parasites, P. knowlesi has a life cycle that requires it be passed back and forth between mammalian hosts and insect hosts. Primates are infected through the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito which carries a parasite stage called the sporozoite in its salivary glands. Sporozoites follow the blood stream to the primate liver where they develop and replicate over five to six days before bursting, releasing thousands of daughter cells called merozoites into the blood (unlike the related P. vivax, P. knowlesi does not make latent hypnozoites in the liver). The merozoites in the blood attach to and invade the primate's red blood cells. Inside the red blood cell, the parasite progresses through several morphologically distinguishable stages, called the ring stage, the trophozoite, and the schizont. The schizont-infected red blood cells eventually burst, releasing up to 16 new merozoites into the blood stream that infect new red blood cells and continue the cycle. P. knowlesi completes this red blood cell cycle every 24 hours, making it uniquely rapid among primate-infecting Plasmodium species (which generally take 48 or 72 hours). Occasionally, parasites that invade red blood cells instead enter a sexual cycle, developing over approximately 48 hours into distinct sexual forms called microgametocytes or macrogametocytes. These gametocytes remain in the blood to be ingested by mosquitoes. A mosquito ingests gametocytes when it takes a blood meal from an infected primate host. Once inside the mosquito gut, the gametocytes develop into gametes and then fuse to form a diploid zygote. The zygote matures into an ookinete, which migrates through the wall of the mosquito gut and develops into an oocyst. The oocyst then releases thousands of sporozoites, which migrate through the mosquito to the salivary glands. This entire process in the mosquito takes 12 to 15 days. Cell biology A Plasmodium knowlesi merozoite attaching to a red blood cell P. knowlesi largely resembles other Plasmodium species in its cell biology. Its genome consists of 23.5 megabases of DNA separated into 14 chromosomes. It contains approximately 5200 protein-coding genes, 80% of which have orthologs present in P. falciparum and P. vivax. The genome contains two large gene families that are unique to P. knowlesi: the SICAvar (schizont-infected cell agglutination variant) family, which is involved in displaying different antigens on the parasite surface to evade the immune system, and the Kir (knowlesi interspersed repeat) family, involved in adhering parasitized red blood cells to blood vessel walls. As an apicomplexan, P. knowlesi has several distinctive structures at its apical end that are specialized for invading host cells. These include the large bulbous rhoptries, smaller micronemes, and dispersed dense granules, each of which secretes effectors to enter and modify the host cell. Like other apicomplexans, P. knowlesi also has two organelles of endosymbiotic origin: a single large mitochondrion and the apicoplast, both of which are involved in the parasite's metabolism. Evolution and taxonomy Despite its morphological similarity to P. malariae, P. knowlesi is most closely related to P. vivax as well as other Plasmodium species that infect non-human primates. The last common ancestor of all modern P. knowlesi strains lived an estimated 98,000 to 478,000 years ago. Among human parasites, P. knowlesi is most closely related to P. vivax, from which it diverged between 18 million and 34 million years ago. A phylogenetic tree comparing the Plasmodium species that infect humans is shown below: The population of P. knowlesi parasites is more genetically diverse than that of P. falciparum or P. vivax. Within P. knowlesi there are three genetically distinct subpopulations. Two are present in the same areas of Malaysian Borneo and may infect different mosquitoes. The third has been found only in laboratory isolates originating from other parts of Southeast Asia. Populations of P. knowlesi isolated from macaques are genetically indistinguishable from those isolated from human infections, suggesting the same parasite populations can infect humans and macaques interchangeably. Three subspecies of P. knowlesi have been described based on differences in their appearance in stained blood films: P. knowlesi edesoni, P. knowlesi sintoni, and P. knowlesi arimai, which were isolated from Malaysia, Java, and Taiwan respectively. The relationship between these described subspecies and the populations described in the modern literature is not clear. Distribution Plasmodium knowlesi is found throughout Southeast Asia, where it primarily infects the long-tailed macaque, pig-tailed macaque, and Sumatran surili as well as the mosquito vectors Anopheles hackeri in peninsular Malaysia and Anopheles latens in Sarawak. Long-tailed macaques in the wild can be infected with P. knowlesi without any apparent disease, even when they are simultaneously infected with various other Plasmodium species. P. knowlesi is rarely found outside of Southeast Asia, likely because the mosquitoes it infects are restricted to that region. Role in human disease Giemsa-stained thin blood smears of human red blood cells infected with Plasmodium knowlesi P. knowlesi can cause both uncomplicated and severe malaria in humans. Those infected nearly always experience fever and chills. People with uncomplicated P. knowlesi malaria often also experience headaches, joint pain, malaise, and loss of appetite. Less commonly, people report coughing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Laboratory tests of infected people nearly always show a low platelet count, although this rarely leads to bleeding problems. Unlike other human malarias, P. knowlesi malaria tends to have fevers that spike every 24 hours, and is therefore often called daily or \\"quotidian\\" malaria. Uncomplicated P. knowlesi malaria can be treated with antimalarial drugs. At least 10% of people infected with P. knowlesi develop severe malaria. Severe P. knowlesi malaria resembles severe malaria caused by P. falciparum. Those with severe disease may experience shortness of breath, abdominal pain, and vomiting. As disease progresses, parasites replicate to very high levels in the blood likely causing acute kidney injury, jaundice, shock, and respiratory distress. Metabolic acidosis is uncommon, but can occur in particularly severe cases. Unlike P. falciparum malaria, severe P. knowlesi malaria rarely causes coma or severe anemia. Approximately 1-2% of cases are fatal. =Diagnosis= Malaria is traditionally diagnosed by examining Giemsa-stained blood films under a microscope; however, differentiating P. knowlesi from other Plasmodium species in this way is challenging due to their similar appearance. P. knowlesi ring-stage parasites stained with Giemsa resemble P. falciparum ring stages, appearing as a circle with one or two dark dots of chromatin. Older trophozoites appear more dispersed, forming a rectangular-shape spread across the host cell called a \\"band-form\\" that resembles the similar stage in P. malariae. During this stage, dots sometimes appear across the host red blood cell, called \\"Sinton and Mulligans' stippling\\". Schizonts appear, similarly to other Plasmodium species, as clusters of purple merozoites surrounding a central dark-colored pigment. Due to the morphological similarity among Plasmodium species, misdiagnosis of P. knowlesi infection as P. falciparum, P. malariae, or P. vivax is common. While some rapid diagnostic tests can detect P. knowlesi, they tend to have poor sensitivity and specificity and are therefore not always reliable. Detection of nucleic acid by PCR or real-time PCR is the most reliable method for detecting P. knowlesi, and differentiating it from other Plasmodium species infection. However, due to the relatively slow and expensive nature of PCR, this is not available in many endemic areas. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification methods of P. knowlesi detection have also been developed, but are not yet widely used. =Treatment= Because P. knowlesi takes only 24 hours to complete its erythrocytic cycle, it can rapidly result in very high levels of parasitemia with fatal consequences. For those with uncomplicated malaria, the World Health Organization recommends treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) or chloroquine. For those with severe malaria, the World Health Organization recommends administration of intravenous artesunate for at least 24 hours, followed by ACT treatment. Additionally, early drug trials have suggested that combinations of chloroquine and primaquine, artesunate and mefloquine, artemether and lumefantrine, and chloroquine alone could be effective treatments for uncomplicated P. knowlesi malaria. There is no evidence of P. knowlesi developing resistance to current antimalarials. =Epidemiology= P. knowlesi is the most common cause of malaria in Malaysia, and cases of P. knowlesi malaria have been reported in most countries of Southeast Asia as well as travelers from the region. Infection with P. knowlesi is associated with socioeconomic and lifestyle factors that bring people into the dense forests where the mosquito hosts are commonly found. In particular, those who work in the forest or at its margin such as farmers, hunters, and loggers are at increased risk for infection. Likely for this reason, males are infected more frequently than females, and adults are infected more frequently than children. Research P. knowlesi has long been used as a research model for studying the interaction between parasite and host, and developing antimalarial vaccines and drugs. Its utility as a research model is partly due to its ability to infect rhesus macaques, a common laboratory model primate. Rhesus macaques are highly susceptible to P. knowlesi and can be infected by mosquito bite, injection of sporozoites, or injection of blood-stage parasites. Infected monkeys develop some hallmarks of human malaria including anemia and enlargement of the spleen and liver. Infection is typically fatal if untreated, with the cause of death seemingly circulatory failure characterized by adhesion of infected red blood cells to the blood vessel walls. Monkeys can be cured of infection by treatment with antimalarials; repeated infection followed by cure results in the monkeys developing some immunity to infection, a topic that has also been the subject of substantial research. P. knowlesi is also used for in vitro research into Plasmodium cell biology. Isolated sporozoites can infect primary rhesus hepatocytes, allowing the in vitro study of the parasite liver stage. Additionally, P. knowlesi and P. falciparum are the only Plasmodium species that can be maintained continuously in cultured red blood cells, both rhesus and human. Facilitating molecular biology research, the P. knowlesi genome has been sequenced and is available on PlasmoDB and other online repositories. P. knowlesi can be genetically modified in the lab by transfection either in the rhesus macaque model system, or in blood cell culture. Blood-infecting stages and sporozoites can be stored long-term by freezing with glycerolyte, allowing the preservation of strains of interest. History Robert Knowles, after whom P. knowlesi was named The Italian physician Giuseppe Franchini first described what may have been P. knowlesi in 1927 when he noted a parasite distinct from P. cynomolgi and P. inui in the blood of a long-tailed macaque.Franchini G (1927) Su di un plasmodio pigmentato di una scimmia. Arch Ital Sci Med Colon 8:187‚Äì90 In 1931, the parasite was again seen in a long-tailed macaque by H. G. M. Campbell during his work on kala azar (visceral leishmaniasis) in Calcutta; Campbell's colleague Lionel Everard Napier drew blood from the affected monkey and inoculated three laboratory monkeys, one of which was a rhesus macaque that developed a severe infection. Campbell and Napier gave the infected monkey to Biraj Mohan Das Gupta who was able to maintain the parasite by serial passage through monkeys. In 1932, Das Gupta and his supervisor Robert Knowles described the morphology of the parasite in macaque blood, and demonstrated that it could infect three human patients (in each case it was used to induce fever with the hope of treating another infection). Also in 1932, John Sinton and H. W. Mulligan further described the morphology of the parasite in blood cells, determined it to be a distinct species from others described, and named it Plasmodium knowlesi in honor of Robert Knowles. Soon thereafter, in 1935 C. E. Van Rooyen and George R. Pile reported using P. knowlesi infection to treat general paralysis in psychiatric patients. P. knowlesi would go on to be used as a general pyretic agent for various diseases, particularly neurosyphilis for which it was used until at least 1955. While Cyril Garnham had suggested in 1957 that P. knowlesi might naturally infect humans, the first documented case of a human naturally infected with P. knowlesi was in 1965 in a U.S. Army surveryor who developed chills and fever after a five-day deployment in Malaysia. Based on this finding, a team at the Institute for Medical Research in Peninsular Malaysia undertook a survey of people living in proximity to macaques, but failed to find evidence that simian malaria was being transmitted to humans. Through the 1960s and 1970s, scientific research groups used P. knowlesi as a research model to make seminal discoveries in malaria. In 1965 and 1972, several groups characterized how P. knowlesi antigenic variation contributed to immune evasion and chronic infection. In 1975, Louis H. Miller and others showed that P. knowlesi required Duffy factor on the surface of red blood cells in order to invade them (they would go on to show the same requirement for P. vivax a year later). Work on P. knowlesi as a human malaria parasite was revitalized in 2004, when Balbir Singh and others used PCR to show that over half of a group of humans diagnosed with P. malariae malaria in Malaysian Borneo were actually infected with P. knowlesi. Over the following decade, several investigators used molecular detection methods capable of distinguishing P. knowlesi from morphologically similar parasites to attribute an increasing proportion of malaria cases to P. knowlesi throughout Southeast Asia. Work with archival samples has shown that infection with this parasite has occurred in Malaysia at least since the 1990s.

It was founded in 1931 by the government of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. As of the 2011 census, the population of the town is 29,319, declined from 46,900 reported at the 1989 census. Currently, the town has a population of 37,053 as per the 2019 official estimate. The town was known as Sardarapat between 1931 and 1935, and Hoktemberyan from 1935 to 1995. Currently, Armavir is the seat of the Diocese of Armavir of the Armenian Apostolic Church. Etymology Founded in 1931 as Sardarabad, the town was known as Hoktemberyan (meaning the city of October) between 1935 and 1995, named in honor of the October Revolution. In 1992, the town was named Armavir by the government of independent Armenia, after the nearby ancient city of Armavir, founded in the 8th century BC by King Argishti I of Urartu, and became the capital of the Kingdom of Armenia under the Orontid Dynasty in 331 BC. History Historically, the territory of modern-day Armavir is located in the Aragatsotn canton at the centre of Ayrarat; the 15th province of ancient Greater Armenia. The Soviet 11th Red Army invaded the Republic of Armenia on 29 November 1920, and a few days later Armenia became an official part of the Soviet Union on 2 December 1920. The Soviets proclaimed Armenia as a Soviet Socialist Republic under the leadership of Aleksandr Myasnikyan. However, in 1922, Armenia was included in the newly created Transcaucasian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic. By the decision of the Soviet government, the settlement of Armavir was founded as Sardarapat on 26 July 1931, only 8 km north of the ancient city of Armavir, to become the regional centre of the Hoktemberyan raion created earlier in 1930 (known as Ghurdughuli raion until 1935). It was originally founded as a railway station connecting Yerevan with Leninakan (Gyumri). The first major urban plan of the town was introduced by architect Alexander Tamanian. In 1935, the name of the settlement was changed from Sardarapat to Hoktemberyan in honor of the 1917 October Revolution. At the beginning, it was home to Armenian families who migrated from Javakheti, Shirak and Zangezur. During the 1940s, many Yazidis and Kurds from the nearby villages have also settled in Hoktemberyan. With the rapid development of the settlement as an industrial hub, Hoktemberyan was given the status of a town in 1947. The population of the town was further increased in the 1950s and 1960s upon the arrival of repatriated Armenian families from Iran, Syria and Lebanon. In 1966, the Armavir branch of the Yerevan Brandy Company was opened. In 1967, Hoktemberyan became a city of republican subordination. Following the independence of Armenia in 1991, Hoktemberyan was renamed Armavir on 7 November 1995, to become the provincial centre of the newly-formed Armavir Province, as per the 1995 administrative reforms of Armenia. Geography Modern-day Armavir occupies an area of 8.51 km¬≤ within the fertile Ararat plain, at a road distance of 47 km west of the capital Yerevan. The territory around Armavir is among the most important regions of Ancient Armenia. The town is built 6 km northeast of the ancient city of Argishtikhinili and 8 km north of historic Armavir. The region corresponds with the Aragatsotn canton of the ancient Armenian Kingdom. The town is surrounded by many large villages including Sardarapat, Norapat, Mrgashat, Maysisyan and Noravan. =Climate= Armavir has a cold semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BSk), with mildly cold winters and hot summers. The average temperature in January is ‚Äì3.2 ¬∞C and +25 ¬∞C in July. The annual precipitation level is around 305 mm. Demographics Cathedral of Saint Gregory of Narek Upon its foundation in 1931, the town was originally populated by Armenians from Javakheti, Shirak and Zangezur. Later, Yazidis, Kurds and Assyrians from the nearby villages have also settled in Armavir. Many Armenians from Iran, Syria and Lebanon were resettled in Armavir during the 1950s and 1960s, as part of the Armenian repatriation process. The town's population reached its peak with around 47,000 during the final years of the Soviet Union. Following the independence of Armenia and the resulting economic crisis, it has drastically declined, showing 32,034 in the 2001 census, 29,319 in the 2011 census, and around 28,900 as per the 2016 official estimate. The town's Saint Gregory of Narek Church was opened on 30 May 2014 and named after .The church of Saint Gregory of Armavir was consecrated Since its consecration in 2014, the church became the seat of the Diocese of Armavir of the Armenian Apostolic Church. The healthcare in the town is served by the Armavir Medical Center, with a capacity of 280 beds. Culture The territory of modern-day Armavir is surrounded with many archaeological sites that are considered major centers of ancient Armenian civilization, including the nearby settlements of Metsamor, ancient Armavir, and ancient Argishtikhinili. Currently, Armavir is served by a cultural center commonly known as the Red Club. It is also home to a music school, a school of arts, five public libraries, and a theatrical group. There is a private zoological/botanical garden at the northeastern vicinity of the town. In 2016, the town celebrated the 85th anniversary of its foundation, with the presence of delegates from the Russian cities of Armavir and Shakhty.Armavir is celebrating its 85th anniversary Transportation Armavir railway station The town of Armavir is founded on the basis of the train station operating since 1927, as a railway junction between Yerevan and Leninakan/Gyumri. The station was renovated during the 1st decade of the 21st century. In November 2009, the station was provided with an electric locomotive that connects Armavir with the Aragatsavan station and the northwestern Armenia.Armavir Aragatsavan new locomotive The town is also connected with Yerevan and central Armenia through the M-5 Motorway. The H-17 regional road connects Armavir with Gyumri and other parts of northern Armenia. Economy Charles Aznavour Park Since its foundations, Armavir has gradually developed as an important centre for industries, as well as services. The industry of the town is mainly based on food-processing and building materials production. The cotton mill of Armavir opened in 1928 was the first industrial plant of the town. The Hoktemberyan Cannery opened in 1943, was among the largest food-processing plants in the Soviet Union. The Armavir branch of the Yerevan Brandy Company is operating since 1966. On the other hand, the glass factory of Armavir is a major glass container producer for the entire republic. There is a water treatment facility at the eastern suburbs of the town. As a provincial centre, Armavir is home to many branches of prominent banks currently operating in Armenia. Armavir air base was built near the town during the early 20th century and became one of the largest jet pilot training centers for the Soviet Air Force. Education As of 2015, Armavir has 10 public schools, 12 nurseries, 2 intermediate colleges, 3 sport schools, and a school for children with special needs. Armavir is also home to the Tigran Mets Sports and Military College. The Armavir provincial medical centre is located in the town as well. Sport Armavir central square FC Armavir was the football club who represented the town during the Soviet years. It was founded in 1965 as FC Sevan Hoktemberyan. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, FC Armavir participated in the Armenian Leagues mainly throughout the 1990s. The club was dissolved in 2003 due to financial difficulties. The club used to play their home games at the Jubilee Stadium which has a capacity of 10,000 spectators. In 1985, the stadium hosted one group match during the FIFA World Youth Championship hosted by the Soviet Union. Nowadays, it is serving the young teams of the Armavir football school. In February 2017, the Football Federation of Armenia has launched the construction of a football academy in Armavir. With an approximate cost of US$ 3 million, the construction is being jointly financed by the FFA, UEFA and FIFA. It is expected to be completed by October 2019.Working visit of President Serzh Sargsyan to Armavir marz Martial arts including judo, muay thai sambo and taekwondo are also popular in the town.Muay Thai in Armavir The Mayor's cup tournament of judo is annually held in Armavir.Armavir mayor's cup for judo The town's sport school was entirely renovated in 2007.The renovation of Armavir Sport School is almost completed Twin towns ‚Äì sister cities Armavir is twinned with: * Allauch, France * Armavir, Russia * Feodosiya, Ukraine * Shakhty, Russia  See also  *Armavir (ancient city) *Armavir (village) *Armavir, Russia References External links * www.armavir.agro.am Further reading * Tirac'yan, Georg. \\"Armawir.\\" Translated from Armenian by Aida Tcharkhtchian and edited by Jean-Pierre Mah√©.

She was the model for some of Edvard Munch's paintings. She had relationships with Munch and briefly with Swedish playwright and painter August Strindberg. In 1893, she married the Polish writer Stanis≈Çaw Przybyszewski. Together they had two children. She was shot in a hotel room in Tbilisi, Georgia in 1901, three days before her thirty-fourth birthday. Family background Dagny was born in Kongsvinger, Norway, the second of four daughters of Doctor Hans Lemmich Juell and his wife Mindy (n√©e Blehr). As a young woman Dagny changed the spelling of her name from 'Juell' to 'Juel'. The oldest sister, Gudrun, was beautiful and self-confident; Dagny was second born; third-born was a son, Hans Lemmich, who only lived one year; then came Astrid who was something of an invalid, who remained unmarried and stayed with her mother; and finally there was Ragnhild, who was closest to Dagny, and in time became a well-known opera singer. Early education Dagny's early education was taken in hand by Anna Stang, who established a private school for girls in Kongsvinger, and was one of the first advocates for women's rights in Norway, and was an active force in early Feminism. Dagny started studies in 1875, and six years later completed exams for entry into middle school. For several years she studied subjects such as Nature, History, Geography, Mathematics, English, German, and Norwegian language. Her results show that she was a diligent student. Erfurt and Oslo On 3 November 1882, two days after her confirmation, she left for Europe, to study music in Erfurt. In January 1890 Dagny and her sister Ragnhild moved to Oslo (then named Christiana) to continue their studies. There Dagny became involved with the bohemian life of the city. She had a brief relationship with Hjalmar Christensen in February and March. Berlin Dagny chose to continue her studies in Berlin, possibly for the reason that she could be with Munch, who had travelled there in the autumn of 1892, after the Union of Berlin Artists had invited him to stage a November exhibition of his work. The scandal that resulted from the exhibition made Munch a notable figure in Berlin, and he decided to stay there. Dagny first attended the Berlin bar Zum schwarzen Ferkel on 8 March 1893. It was there she met August Strindberg. Strindberg and his friends gave her the nickname 'Aspasia'. She had a brief relationship (about 3 weeks) with Strindberg. Adolf Paul was also taken with her beauty. She modelled for various Scandinavian artists, and was Munch's impresario for a period. She is almost certainly the model for Munch's painting Jealousy. Marriage Juel and Przybyszewski Przybyszewski left his common-law wife Martha Foerder and their two children (born in February and November 1892), and married Dagny on 18 August 1893. Przybyszewski and Dagny had two children, and while married to Dagny, he fathered another child with Martha (this third child was born on 6 February 1895). Martha was found dead in her home on 9 June 1896, and Przybyszewski was arrested on suspicion of her murder, but after spending two weeks in prison, he was released when it was determined that she had died of poisoning by carbon monoxide, and that it was almost certainly suicide. Some surviving fragments of Dagny's writing show her returning to the theme of two lovers causing the death of a third. Dagny Juel with her son Zenon Dagny refused to raise Martha's three motherless children. In fact, Dagny, though a loving mother, was in the habit of leaving her own two children (Zenon born on 28 September 1895, and Ivi (Iwa) born on 2 or 5 October 1897, probably by cesarian section) with her parents in Kongsvinger for periods of time. The decadent and financially precarious life with the increasingly alcohol-dependent Przybyszewski in Berlin was far from a suitable environment to raise children. Abandonment and death Portrait of Dagny Juel Przybyszewska by Konrad Krzy≈ºanowski Dagny accompanied Przybyszewski to Krak√≥w where he became a key figure in the Young Poland movement, and editor of the journal ≈ªycie. While travelling in Galicia, Przybyszewski became involved with the wife of his friend Jan Kasprowicz, and abandoned Dagny for this woman. Stanis≈Çaw Przybyszewski may have encouraged Dagny's relationships with Henryk Sienkiewicz (who arranged a grant of 3200 Austrian Kronen from the Polish Academy of Talent for Przybyszewski) and with W≈Çadys≈Çaw Emeryk, the son of a mine-owner. There is some evidence that Przybyszewski and Emeryk may have plotted her murder. At the time of Dagny's death, Przybyszewski was involved with two other women in Poland -- Jadwiga Kasprowiczowa and Aniela PajƒÖk√≥wna, one of whose two daughters was Przybyszewski's, while Dagny had romantic relationships with at least three men in Paris, including Emeryk. Emeryk invited Przybyszewski and Dagny on a trip to visit his family in the Caucasus; at the last minute Przybyszewski backed out, saying he would join them later. On 5 June 1901, in a room of the small 'Grand Hotel' in the Georgian capital city of Tiflis (now Tbilisi), Emeryk shot Juel in the head; the next day he attempted to shoot himself. Juel's 5-year-old son, Zenon, witnessed the murder of his mother.Krzemi≈Ñski, Andrzej:, Nihilizm polski albo kat na baby( ). She was buried at a Roman Catholic church in Tiflis and reburied, in 1999, into a churchyard at the Kukia cemetery.

Biography Orlando Wong was born in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1952.Habekost, Christian (1993) Verbal Riddim: Politics and Aesthetics of African-Caribbean Dub Poetry, Rodopi B.V. Editions, pp. 19‚Äì22, . He grew up in the slums of Eastern Kingston's Franklin Town and received an informal education from a Rastafarian named Negus. Wong's rebellious nature initially led him to engage in demonstrations against police violence and painting slogans on walls.Brennan, Sandra \\"[ Oku Onuora Biography]\\", Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation, retrieved 20 December 2009 When a project to provide a ghetto school and community centre to benefit the area's youths hit financial difficulties, Wong began engaging in guerrilla activities, based in the hills around Kingston, including armed robberies. After one of these robberies, of a post office, Wong was captured and sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment in 1970.Elliott, Lianne (2005) \\"Dub poetry mirrors rhythms of life\\", The Record, 1 November 2005. After attempting to escape twice (he was shot five times by the police during the first attempt), instigating a prison riot, and campaigning for prison reform, Wong was classed as a security risk and subjected to a harsh regime at the Fort Augusta Prison.Walker, Klive (2006), Dubwise: Reasoning from the Reggae Underground, Insomniac Press, pp. 166‚Äì168, . He began writing poetry in 1971,Larkin, Colin (1998), The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, p. 212, . and became the first inmate to be allowed to perform with a reggae band in 1974 when Cedric Brooks' band The Light of Saba performed in the prison. After the performance, however, Wong's poetry was declared \\"subversive\\" and his writing was confiscated from his cell. He considered himself a political prisoner, and continued writing, with his poetry finding an audience in the outside world after being smuggled out of prison, coming to the attention of Jamaican writers, especially UWI Professor Mervyn Morris. Wong's poetry also won three prizes in the 1976 Jamaica Literary Festival. His profile was further raised when he was allowed out of prison for a poetry reading at the Tom Redcam Library in 1977. Also in 1977, several of his poems were published in Jamaica's national newspapers, including the Daily Gleaner and Jamaica Daily News. His play Confrontation was performed on JBC radio, and Morris arranged for the publication of his first collection of poetry, ECHO by Sangsters (1978). Well-known literary and cultural personalities, and students at the University of the West Indies, through the Human Rights Council & the Prisoners Rehabilitation Committee, campaigned for his release, which was achieved on 1 September 1977, when he received the equivalent of a presidential pardon from then Attorney General Carl Rattray, a poet himself. After his release, he was granted a scholarship to the Jamaica School of Drama, although he dropped out after a year. In 1978, he and fellow dub poet Mikey Smith performed at the 11th World Festival of Youth and Students in Cuba, where he came to the attention of Lillian Allen; the performance inspired her to start the dub poetry scene back in Canada. Onuora married Adugo (n√©e Phyllis Ranglin) in 1978, in preparation for which he had a name change, the name being chosen by his bride-to-be (who did not want to be identified as Mrs. Wong) with the help of an Afrikan Professor Umona. Their names were chosen from the Igbo language from the southeastern region of Nigeria. \\"Oku\\" means Fire / Light which burns oppression, while \\"Onuora\\" means voice of the people. His full name, Oku Nagba Ozala Onuora, translates as everlasting fire or light which burns oppression.Campbell, Howard (2010) \\"Oku still rebelling against the system\\", Jamaica Gleaner, 28 March 2010, retrieved 31 March 2010. Together with Adugo, Onuora founded the \\"Prugresiv Aartis Muvmant\\". The \\"Reflections in Red\\" single was his first musical release, and the first Jamaican dub poetry record, recorded with the backing of Wailers rhythm section Aston and Carlton Barrett at Tuff Gong studios and released in 1979 on Bob Marley's \\"56 Hope Road\\" label. The poem expressed his scepticism over the peace truce between Kingston's rival gangs, although he went on to perform at the One Love Peace Concert that celebrated the truce. ECHO, Onuora's first poetry collection, has been reprinted several times with some five editions, some translated into French/patois and one edition in German. Onuora toured Europe extensively, forming a friendship with Linton Kwesi Johnson, and released his first album, Pressure Drop, which featured several poems from ECHO, in France on the Blue Moon Music label and in the US on Heartbeat Records in 1986. He toured the USA and France with his AK7 (Armageddon Knights Column 7) band performing at the prestigious Angoul√™me Jazz Festival in France. Onuora concentrated on writing plays and directing drama for the latter half of the 1980s and early 1990s, but subsequently returned to poetry and music and recorded several instrumental dub albums, working with musician Courtney Panton.Moskowitz, David V. (2006), Caribbean Popular Music: an Encyclopedia of Reggae, Mento, Ska, Rock Steady, and Dancehall, Greenwood Press, pp. 225‚Äì226, . Onuora ceased to be involved in music in the 1990s due to what he called \\"negative elements\\" taking over. In 2010, Onuora announced a new album, entitled A Movement, and his intention to return to live performance. The album was released in May 2013, featuring pianist Monty Alexander and Sly and Robbie, and is a tribute to his wife Adugo Ranglin-Onuora, who died in July 2011.Campbell-Livingston, Cecelia (2013) \\"New Movements From Oku\\", Jamaica Observer, 22 May 2013.

Geography The community is located three miles east of Interstate 65, approximately north of Birmingham and 28 miles south of Cullman. History Blount Springs's mineral springs and rural setting made it a summer resort for thousands of wealthy people from Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, and more from 1820 to the 1930s. The sulfur springs were renowned for their curative properties. More than the health benefits, Old Blount became known for its social scene as the gentry of the Black Belt and later the City of Birmingham took advantage of the cooler temperatures of the area during the heat and malarial conditions of late summer. The Goff House and Duffee House were antebellum hotels of renown there. Col. J. F. B. Jackson built a resort hotel, the Jackson House, in 1872 around the sulfur springs. In 1887, Jackson sold the land and hotel to James Sloss and his brother, Mack Sloss, who renamed it Blount Springs Hotel. It became one of the finest hotels in the Southeast and was known for its hospitality and the highest quality food and parties. Besides hotels, cottages were available for guest use as well as horseback riding, gambling (permitted by state law only at water places), ten pins and plenty of spirits. Many of the regulars owned their own cottages and spent every season (July through October) at the springs. Visitors to the springs occasionally made the four- mile trip to the northeast to visit the nearby Bangor Cave. Celebrities and important people visited and politicians galore spoke and vacationed there. Governors of several states, Senators and other office holders and seekers were constantly visiting. Teddy Roosevelt once made an appearance. One of the largest stars of the day, Lillian Russell, came for an extended visit and created quite a stir after she enjoyed a day of sunbathing and was covered in chigger bites. It took every ounce of butter in the town and surrounding countryside to sooth the most famous body in the country. Diamond Jim Brady, New York restaurateur and gentleman friend of Miss Russell, also accompanied her on the trip. The resort burned down on June 3, 1915, after a fire started in the kitchen of the main hotel and it also burned much of the town. The fire marked the end of the resort and the town, combined with the changing of the railroad so that it didn't go through town anymore and the easy access to other entertainments. Those that owned cottages and a few others still came for the next several years. There was an attempt to locate a Veteran's Hospital that failed. Other development plans by members of the Drennen family for a large village and resurgence of the springs never came to fruition. Blount Springs became sparsely populated and largely undeveloped for several decades. In the late 1980s, Blount Springs Recolonization Partners began work on The Village at Blount Springs, the first stage of a planned gated community designed by Duany, Plater-Zyberk architects on the former site of the Blount Springs resort. Numerous springs emerge at the site of the former resort, each containing a different mineral (white sulfur, red sulfur, and lithium, to name a few). When the resort was still in operation, water from the springs was sold in blue glass bottles. Shards of these bottles fill the soil near the foundations of the resort, and are said to bring good luck. A post office operated under the name Blount Springs from 1830 to 1957. Demographics Blount Springs appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as an incorporated town having 156 residents. It was the only time it appeared on census rolls.

Indicatrix An important special case of the index ellipsoid occurs when the ellipsoid is an ellipsoid of revolution, i.e. constructed by rotating an ellipse around either the minor or major axis, when two axes are equal and a third is different. In this case, there is only one optical axis, the axis of rotation, and the material is said to be uniaxial. When all axes of the index ellipsoid are equal, the material is isotropic, commonly known as cubic. In all other cases, in which the ellipsoid has three distinct axes, the material is called biaxial.

Its maximum sustained winds were at . =Hurricane Four= On September 18 a tropical storm was first observed and lasted until September 30. It formed to the east-southeast of the Lesser Antilles. It hit the Lesser Antilles and then the Greater Antilles, later curving north and striking near Punta Rassa, Florida, with winds up to . It then went back out to sea and hit South Carolina, tracked through North Carolina, and then made its way out to sea, where it eventually dissipated. On September 20, as the storm passed through the Lesser Antilles, it produced heavy rains and high winds over several islands. On Martinique, high winds and continuous, torrential rains impacted the island. Despite the intensity of the storm, there were no reports of damage in the Lesser Antilles. In Hispaniola, more than 500 homes and two churches were destroyed; numerous other structures sustained damage, mainly having their roofs blown off. The cyclone produced heavy rainfall in Florida, including over a 54-hour period at Tampa; at Titusville, fell in two days. Jacksonville registered a storm total of .

The portion of Broadway from 3rd to 9th streets in the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, was the city's main commercial street from the 1910s until World War II. It is also the location of the Broadway Theater District, the first and largest historic theater district listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). With twelve movie palaces located along a six-block stretch of Broadway, it is the only large concentration of movie palaces left in the United States. Route South Broadway's southern terminus is Main Street just north of the San Diego Freeway (I-405) in Carson. From there it runs north through Athens and South Los Angeles to Downtown Los Angeles ‚Äì at Olympic Blvd. entering downtown's Historic Core, in which the buildings lining Broadway form the Broadway Theater District. Crossing 3rd Street, Broadway passes through the Civic Center including Grand Park. After crossing the Hollywood Fwy. (US 101), signs read \\"North Broadway\\" as it enters Chinatown. It then curves northeast, passing through old railyards, crosses the Golden State Fwy. (I-5) and heads due east to its terminus at Mission Road in Lincoln Heights. History =Founding and extension= Broadway, one of the oldest streets in the city, was laid out as part of the 1849 plan of Los Angeles made by Lieutenant Edward Ord and named Fort Street. Fort Street began at the south side of Fort Moore Hill (a block north of Temple Street) at Sand Street (later California Street). In 1890, the name of Fort Street, from 1st Street to 10th Street, was changed to Broadway. The rest of Fort Street, from California Street to 1st Street, was changed to North Broadway. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Proposal for opening Broadway through to Buena Vista Street (now North Broadway), and extending the street south into what was then part of Main Street, below Tenth Street, in order to give a continuous, wide thoroughfare from the southern city limits to the Eastside, was made as early as February 1891. Alternate Link via ProQuest. The Broadway Tunnel under Fort Moore Hill was opened in 1901, extending North Broadway to Buena Vista Street at Bellevue Avenue (later Sunset Boulevard, now Cesar Chavez Avenue). A section of Broadway in South Los Angeles was originally named Moneta Avenue until 1923. Alternate Link via ProQuest. In 1909, construction on a bridge across the Los Angeles River was begun to connect Buena Vista Street to Downey Avenue, which ran from the river to Mission Road. The names of Buena Vista and Downey were then changed to North Broadway, Alternate Link via ProQuest. Alternate Link via ProQuest. but not without significant objections from affected residents and landowners. The bridge, which continued to be referred to as the Buena Vista Street Bridge for a good while, was opened to traffic in late September 1911. Alternate Link via ProQuest. =Los Angeles' central commercial and entertainment street= For more than 50 years, Broadway from 1st Street to Olympic Boulevard was the main commercial street of Los Angeles, and one of its premier theater and movie palace districts as well. It contains a vast number of historic buildings and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Prior to the turn of the 20th century, the city's Central Business District was further north, along Spring and Main streets between the Plaza and 2nd Street. In 1895 J.W. Robinson's opened what was then considered a very large and impressive four- story department store at 239 S. Broadway, signaling of the shift over the next decade and a half of the main shopping district to Broadway below 2nd Street. Retail hub From around 1905 through the 1950s, Broadway was considered the center of the city, where residents went to ornate movie palaces and live theaters, and shopped at major department stores and shops. See the Table of department stores on Broadway and Seventh streets below. The square footage of the four largest department stores alone ‚Äî Bullock's at , The Broadway at , May Co. at over https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39054539/los-angeles-herald/ and J. W.

Among dozens of significant buildings from that era are the Bradbury Building, Ace Hotel Los Angeles, and the Los Angeles Examiner building designed by Julia Morgan. Some of the movie theaters on the street fell into disuse and disrepair, some were replaced with parking lots, but many have been repurposed and/or restored. The department stores closed in the 1970s and 1980s, but Broadway has been the premier shopping destination for working class Latinos for decades. Theater District NRHP refers to the district as the Broadway Theater and Commercial District, while the City of Los Angeles Planning Department refers to the Broadway Theater and Entertainment District.Broadway Theater and Entertainment District Design Guide, City of Los Angeles Planning Department, 2009 =Highest concentration of movie palaces in the world= Stretching for six blocks from Third to Ninth Streets, the district includes 12 movie theaters built between 1910 and 1931. By 1931, the district had the highest concentration of cinemas in the world, with seating capacity for more than 15,000 patrons. Broadway was the hub of L.A.'s entertainment scene ‚Äì a place where \\"screen goddesses and guys in fedoras rubbed elbows with Army nurses and aircraft pioneers.\\" In 2006, the Los Angeles Times wrote: > \\"There was a time, long ago, when the streets of downtown Los Angeles were > awash in neon‚Äîthanks to a confluence of movie theaters the world had never > seen before. Dozens of theaters screened Hollywood's latest fare, played > host to star-studded premieres and were filled nightly with thousands of > moviegoers. In those days, before World War II, downtown L.A. was the movie > capital of the world.\\" Columnist Jack Smith called it \\"the only large concentration of vintage movie theaters left in America.\\" Smith recalled growing up a mile from Broadway and spending his Saturdays in the theaters: > \\"I remember walking into those opulent interiors, surrounded by the glory of > the Renaissance, or the age of Baroque, and spending two or three hours in > the dream world of the movies. When I came out again the sky blazed; the > heat bounced off the sidewalk, traffic sounds filled the street, I was back > in the hard reality of the Depression. Because Broadway has been used as a filming location for decades, many of these theatre marquees can be seen in classic Hollywood films, including Safety Last! (1923), D.O.A. (1950), The Omega Man (1971), Blade Runner (1982), and The Artist (2011).Filming locations for \\"D.O.A.\\" (1950) at IMDbFilming locations for \\"The Omega Man\\" (1971) at IMDb =Revitalization by Spanish- language cinema= In the years after World War II, the district began to decline, as first-run movie-goers shifted to the movie palaces in Hollywood, in Westwood Village, and later to suburban multiplexes. After World War II, as Anglo moviegoers moved to the suburbs, many of the Broadway movie palaces became venues for Spanish-language movies and variety shows. In 1988, the Los Angeles Times noted that, without the Hispanic community, \\"Broadway would be dead.\\" Jack Smith wrote that Broadway had been \\"rescued and revitalized\\" by \\"the Latino renaissance.\\" =Preservation and renovation efforts= The district has been the subject of preservation and restoration efforts since the 1980s. In 1987, the Los Angeles Conservancy started a program called \\"Last Remaining Seats\\" in which the old movie palaces were opened each summer to show classic Hollywood movies. In 1994, the Conservancy's associate director, Gregg Davidson, noted: \\"When we started this, the naysayers said no one will go downtown to an old theater to see an old movie in the middle of the summer, but we get a number of people who have never seen a movie in a theater with a balcony. The older people (go) for nostalgia. And the movie people‚Äîseeing a classic film on a big screen is a different experience.\\" After attending a Conservancy screening, one writer noted: \\"The other night I went to the movies and was transported to a world of powdered wigs and hoop skirts, a rococo fantasy of gilded cherubs and crystal chandeliers. And then the film started.\\" Despite preservation efforts, many of the theaters have been converted to other uses, including flea markets and churches. The Broadway movie palaces fell victim to a number of circumstances, including changing demographics and tastes, a downtown location that was perceived as dangerous at night, and high maintenance costs for aging facilities. With the closure of the State Theater in 1998, the Orpheum and the Palace were the only two still screening films. In 2006, the Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"Of all of L.A.'s many hidden gems, maybe none is as sparkling nor as hidden as the Broadway theater district downtown.\\" Bemoaning the possible loss of such gems, the same writer noted: \\"L.A. gave birth to the movies. To lose the astonishing nurseries where the medium grew up would be tragic.\\" Broadway since 2008 In 2008, the City of Los Angeles launched a $40-million campaign to revitalize the Broadway district, known as the \\"Bringing Back Broadway\\" campaign. Some Latino merchants in the district expressed concern that the campaign was an effort to spread the largely Anglo gentrification taking hold in other parts of downtown to an area that has become the city's leading Latino shopping district. A worker at one of the district's bridal shops noted, \\"On one side, I like the idea. The only thing is that I don't think they want our types of businesses.\\" The Downtown's real estate revitalization, using the City's adaptive reuse ordinance that makes it easier for developers to convert outmoded and/or vacant office and commercial buildings into residential buildings, has reached the Broadway Historic District. It includes the transformation of the United Artists Theater office tower into the Ace Hotel Los Angeles, and restoration of its movie palace. The Bringing Back Broadway commission is working on further reviving the landmark Los Angeles boulevard in the historic district. Led by City Councilman Jose Huizar, the commission has recommended widening sidewalks, eliminating traffic lanes, constructing new parking structures, and bringing back streetcar service reminiscent of the street's past. A pedestrian-friendly project finished up in December 2014 that widened the sidewalks and replaced the parking lane with planters, chairs and round cafe tables with bright-red umbrellas. The Great Streets Initiative seeks to bolster the street-level health of the city by making several dozen boulevards more hospitable to pedestrians, cyclists and small businesses. Mayor Eric Garcetti said the effort represents \\"a shift from the way that our neighborhoods have been planned in Los Angeles,\\" with a new focus on \\"walkability and transit.\\" Broadway retail is transitioning from a broad mix of stores catering to Hispanic immigrants and a burgeoning sneaker and streetwear retail cluster has emerged from 4th to 9th streets: Sneaker Row.https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-sneaker-row-20181208-story.html Retail in and around the Eastern Columbia, located at the intersection of 9th Street & Broadway, has proliferated in recent years with the opening of Acne Studios, Oak NYC, Aesop, Tanner Goods, BNKR, Austere, A.P.C., and Urban Outfitters located in the Rialto Theater (Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No. 472).Fashionista.

Broadcast on many of the major digital television platforms in the UK, Tiny Pop, which was launched on 8 September 2003 as Pop Plus, and shows, its target audience is children aged 7 and under. The station broadcasts principally animated content sourced from various distributors. History Logo as Pop Plus used from 8 September 2003 to 27 July 2004 Tiny Pop logo used from 2011 to 2 September 2018 The channel began on 8 September 2003 as Pop Plus (stylized on-screen as p‚äïp), a secondary service to Pop. The channel was licensed to air animation and music, it operated the same broadcast hours as its sister channel (6am to 8pm at the time; Pop later expanded to its current 24-hour service) and was not a direct timeshift of its sibling, instead offering an alternative mix of the channel's content. (At one point the arrangement was that whilst Pop was showing music Pop Plus would show cartoons, and vice versa, but this was not always the case). On 27 July 2004, it was relaunched as Tiny Pop, which allowed the main Pop to refocus on slightly older children and reduce its use of preschooler shows. As with other CSC channels, on-screen presenters are rarely used: programmes are introduced either by caption and voiceover alone, or through animated characters. For a time during the mid-2000s (decade), a group of animated monkeys, known as the Cheeky Monkeys, would talk about cartoons, read out jokes from viewers and show artwork; from the end of June 2009, they were replaced with three new hosts, Molly, Leo and Pip (who are also monkeys). Tiny Pop initially broadcast on satellite TV - Sky (now channel 617) from the channel's launch, and Freesat (channel 605) from the launch of the platform in 2008. On 11 October 2007, Tiny Pop was launched on Virgin Media, along with its sister channel Pop. Pop was removed in 2011, but was brought back on 25 August 2016. The station has also been made available over other cable systems. On 14 July 2016, Tiny Pop +1 was temporarily replaced by Pop Max. The channel aired back-to-back episodes of a show from POP. Tiny Pop +1 returned on 1 December 2016. The channel ran a second time from 9 February 2017 to 25 April 2017. On 3 September 2018, Tiny Pop unveiled a new logo after seven years in use.

Freeview On 23 October 2014, Tiny Pop was launched on Freeview, running daily from 3 pm to 7 pm in a slot timeshared with the Community Channel. On 7 January 2015, Tiny Pop was launched fully on DTT and as from 15 March 2017, is now broadcast 24 hours a day on Freeview. Round-the- clock service continues on satellite and cable. Prior to January 2015, the channel had broadcast billed programmes from 0600 to 2230, teleshopping content from 2230 to 0130, and a 'Through the Night' programming block from 0130 to 0600. From 1 January 2015, the schedule changed to run billed content from 0600 to 0000, with 'Through the Night' for the remaining six hours, with the teleshopping block dropped; sister channel Pop had also removed its prior teleshopping block ahead of its move onto Freeview. Sister channel Pop also showed Tiny Pop programmes until February 2015. On 15 March 2017, Tiny Pop changed its service on Freeview, moving to the Local Television multiplexes across the UK, meaning that the channel is only available on Freeview where a local television service (e.g. Made in Cardiff) is broadcast.

When not necessarily referring to a legal decision, this can also be referred to as a minority report.Definition of \\"minority report\\". Oxford Dictionaries Online. Retrieved Nov 2012.Definition of \\"minority report\\", Macmillan Dictionary Retrieved Nov 2012. Dissenting opinions are normally written at the same time as the majority opinion and any concurring opinions, and are also delivered and published at the same time. A dissenting opinion does not create binding precedent nor does it become a part of case law, though they can sometimes be cited as a form of persuasive authority in subsequent cases when arguing that the court's holding should be limited or overturned. In some cases, a previous dissent is used to spur a change in the law, and a later case may result in a majority opinion adopting a particular understanding of the law formerly advocated in dissent. As with concurring opinions, the difference in opinion between dissents and majority opinions can often illuminate the precise holding of the majority opinion. The dissent may disagree with the majority for any number of reasons: a different interpretation of the existing case law, the application of different principles, or a different interpretation of the facts. Many legal systems do not provide for a dissenting opinion and provide the decision without any information regarding the discussion between judges or its outcome. Types of dissenting opinions A dissent in part is a dissenting opinion that disagrees selectively‚Äîspecifically, with one part of the majority holding. In decisions that require holdings with multiple parts due to multiple legal claims or consolidated cases, judges may write an opinion \\"concurring in part and dissenting in part\\". Dissenting opinions by region =United States of America= In some courts, such as the Supreme Court of the United States, the majority opinion may be broken down into numbered or lettered parts, which allows those judges \\"dissenting in part\\" to easily identify the parts in which they join with the majority, and the parts in which they do not. In the mid-20th century, it became customary for the members of the U.S. Supreme Court and many state supreme courts to end their dissenting opinions with a variation on the phrase \\"I respectfully dissent.\\" In turn, the omission of the word \\"respectfully\\" or of the entire phrase altogether is now taken as a signal that the dissenting justice is particularly furious at the majority over the issue dissented upon. =Germany= In the proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court (BVerfG), the fourth amendment to the Federal Constitutional Court Act of 21 December 1970 - in Section 30 (2) BVerfGG - introduced the possibility of a special vote. Since then, the decisions of the BVerfG can be accompanied by a minority opinion with the signature of the differing judge votes. The aim of the reform was to achieve greater transparency in court decisions and to strengthen the position of the individual judge. Special votes are also possible at some state constitutional courts in Germany. For example, Section 12 (1) of the Lower Saxony Law on the State Court provides for the corresponding application of Section 30 (2) BVerfGG. The Hessian State Court Law provides for an independent regulation on the possibility of a special vote in section 16 (3). Special votes are also permitted in arbitration proceedings. The special vote is only permitted at constitutional courts. A minority opinion may not be published in all other courts. A judicial confidentiality obligation arises from ¬ß 43 DRiG, which protects the confidentiality of advice. The introduction of special votes in all courts was discussed in detail at the 47th German Lawyers' Day in 1968. =Italy= A minority opinion cannot be published in judgements of Italian courts. In Constitutional Court a minority vote can be just guessed in case of \\"showy, not negligible distinction between the reporteur and the editor\\". GABRIELE MAESTRI, Autonomia e autodichia delle Camere, tra istituti da ricalibrare e decisioni da prendere, Federalismi, n. 10 - 15/04/2020, p. 251. According to Sabino Cassese, the absence of the dissenting opinion penalizes the potential that the process of constitutional review of the laws would have arouse debates and awareness in the country.\\"Surely the author's insistence on this issue is due, in addition to his knowledge as a scholar, also to the fact that, as a constitutional judge, in occasion of various judgments, he wanted to express his dissent and the motivations of the himself, and he couldn't do it\\": Maria Rosaria Ferrarese, Presentazione del volume di Sabino Cassese, Dentro la Corte.

European Court of Human Rights  Even though Europe has a civil law tradition, the European Convention on Human Rights explicitly states that judges of the European Court of Human Rights may attach their dissenting opinion to the judgment at hand.Article 45, 2. European Convention on Human Rights. Criticism Susan Kiefel, Chief Justice of Australia, has expressed concern at the frequency of judicial dissents and the attention given to them by law students and legal commentators. She believes that they should be reserved for only the most important cases, and has described judges who frequently dissent as \\"somewhat self-indulgent\\". She further observed that \\"humorous dissent may provide the author with fleeting popularity, but it may harm the image the public has of the court and its judges\\".

It is found from Costa Rica south through most areas of South America east of the Andes down to northern Argentina and Uruguay. Despite its name, this species is not restricted to eating only crabs, and the common raccoon also seeks and eats crabs where they are available. Diet The crab-eating raccoon eats crab, lobster, crayfish and other crustaceans and shellfish, such as oysters and clams. It is an omnivore and its diet also includes, for example, small amphibians, turtle eggs, and fruits. It resembles its northern cousin, the common raccoon, in having a bushy ringed tail and \\"bandit mask\\" of fur around its eyes. Unlike the common raccoon, the hair on the nape of the neck points towards the head, rather than backward. The crab-eating raccoon also appears to be more adapted to an arboreal lifestyle than the common raccoon, with sharper, narrower claws. It also is better adapted for a diet of hard-shelled food, with most of the cheek teeth being larger than those of the common raccoon, with broader, rounded cusps. Although the crab-eating raccoon can appear smaller and more streamlined than the common raccoon due to its much shorter fur and more gracile build, the crab-eating raccoon is of similar dimensions to the northern species. Head and body length is , tail length is and height at the shoulder is about . Weights can range from , though are mostly between .Burnie D and Wilson DE (Eds.), Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife. DK Adult (2005), Males are usually larger than the females. Behavior The crab-eating raccoon is solitary and nocturnal, primarily terrestrial but will spend a significant amount of time in trees. It is almost always found near streams, lakes, and rivers. In Panama and Costa Rica, where it is sympatric with the common raccoon, it will be strictly found in inland rivers and streams, while the common raccoon lives in mangrove forests. Less frequently, it will reside in evergreen forests or the plains, but are only rarely found in rainforests. Compared to the common raccoon, which thrives in urban environments and adapts quickly to the presence of humans, the crab- eating raccoon adapts less easily and is much less likely to be found in human environments. Reproduction The crab-eating raccoon breeds between July and September, and gestation lasts between 60 and 73 days. Offspring are born in crevices, hollow trees, or abandoned nests from other creatures. Between 2 and 7 kits are born, with 3 being the average. While typically crab-eating raccoons only breed once per year, if a female loses all her kits early in the season, they will mate again and have a second litter. Males have no part in raising young, and while attending to young, females will become much more territorial and will not tolerate other raccoons around them.

The community lies east of Interstate 65 and approximately 30 miles north of Birmingham. Bangor is located near the former resort community of Blount Springs. In 1937, the landowner of Bangor Cave, J. Breck Musgrove, convinced investors to provide funds for the construction of a nightclub in the cave. The cave soon included a bar, electric lighting, a bandstand, and a lounge for women. A locked room contained slot machines, roulette wheels and card tables.

The product line was first introduced in Europe in 1945 by Hoffmann-La Roche, which branded the name based on panthenol as a shampoo ingredient. It was purchased by Procter & Gamble in 1985 in order to compete in the \\"beauty product\\" market rather than only functional products. The brand's best-known product became the 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioning formula, Pantene Pro-V (Pantene Pro-Vitamin). The product became most noted due to an advertising campaign in the 1989 in which fashion models said, \\"Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.\\"Forbes, Volume 139, Issues 5-9, 1987, p136 Kelly Le Brock and Iman gained notoriety as the first television spokeswomen to speak the line. The line was criticized by feminists and became a pop-culture catchphrase for \\"annoying\\" narcissistic behavior. Advertising campaigns The ambassadors of Pantene (from left to right: Ana Brenda, Gisele B√ºndchen and Stephanie Cayo) In 1990, Procter & Gamble Taiwan launched a new advertising campaign surrounding its new Pantene Pro-V formula, a combining of Pantene's vitamin formula and P&G;'s 2-in-1 technology. Pantene Pro-V was first introduced in Taiwan and a year later in the US and globally. Research results, compiled from markets around the world, led P&G; to hypothesize that health positioning might provide the basis for a new worldwide hair care franchise. The research indicated that: Women believed the ideal standard for hair is \\"healthy\\". Women considered their own hair damaged. Women believed that shine signaled health. Pro-vitamin formulation provided real support for claims. Advertising was developed around a health positioning and customized at the local level with the tagline, \\"Hair So Healthy It Shines.\\" The new product, Pantene Pro-V was introduced in newly designed cylindrical shaped bottles. There were four lead countries involved in Pantene's Pro-V launch. Each communicated a different piece of the strategy and execution elements, as follows * United States: a Television campaign was developed using an authoritative spokeswoman and showing the transformation of the model's hair; * Taiwan: dramatized the end- result - the shine (a very powerful end benefit in this part of the world); * France: dramatized the vitamin capsule ingredient story; * United Kingdom: demonstrated product efficacy via the hair root demonstration. By 1994, following its launch in 55 countries, Pantene was the #1 hair care brand around the world with sales reaching over $1 billion USD. By 1996, it was still leading in 78 countries and by 1998, it was the leading shampoo in 90 countries. Pantene was advertised as approved by Swiss Vitamin Institute.url=http://www.swissvitamin.ch/ title=Swiss Vitamin Institute Currently, Pantene is widely available in much of the world.

History FLOC was founded in Toledo, Ohio, in 1967 by Baldemar Velasquez.Barger and Reza, The Farm Labor Movement in the Midwest, 1994. A migrant worker who had worked in the fields since he was six years old, Velasquez led his first strike at the age of 12.Franklin, \\"Farm Workers' Group Pushes for Better Pay, Rights,\\" Chicago Tribune, April 8, 2006. By the time he was 20 years old and a college student, Velasquez had already faced numerous beatings and arrests. But in 1967, with the help of his father and others, Velasquez organized FLOC among migrant field workers picking tomatoes in Ohio.\\"FLOC Founder to Speak on Pesticide Poisoning,\\" The Monitor, August 23, 1999; Rosenbaum, \\"Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC): Grassroots Organizing for the Empowerment of the Migrant Farm Worker Community,\\" Culture and Agriculture, Fall 1993; Rosenbaum, \\"Unionization of Tomato Field Workers in Northwest Ohio, 1967‚Äì1969,\\" Labor History, Summer 1994. FLOC's initial organizing strategy was to focus on workers, as most unions did. FLOC organizers followed migrant workers year-round, moving south to Texas and Florida every winter to build an organizing base.\\"The Power of Organizing: Securing Farmworkers' Rights,\\" Multinational Monitor, May 1993. By 1977, however, FLOC had only 700 members. =Campbell's Soup boycott= In 1978, Velasquez decided to adopt a new organizing strategy. The union believed that Ohio tomato growers would be unable to recruit enough workers to see them through a long strike. So that year 2,000 FLOC members walked off their jobs in Ohio. While some growers were willing to negotiate, big canners such as the Campbell Soup Company were unwilling to pay the higher prices which would accompany a unionized workforce. FLOC initiated a boycott of Campbell's. Six years later, not much had changed even though FLOC had conducted a well- publicized 560-mile march from Toledo to Campbell Soup headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, in 1983. Even the support of the National Council of Churches and a group of Catholic bishops in Ohio failed to sway the company.Sinclair, \\"Saucy Union Battles Tomato Giants,\\" Washington Post, July 8, 1982; Serrin, \\"Migrant Workers Organize a Boycott of Campbell,\\" New York Times, July 2, 1984; \\"Bishops in Ohio Support Boycott of Campbell,\\" Associated Press, June 18, 1985. In 1984, FLOC asked labor organizer and consultant Ray Rogers for help. Rogers developed a corporate campaign strategy which included a resolution and well-publicized demonstration at a Campbell Soup shareholder meeting. \\" 'You had these little nuns get up at stockholders' meetings saying I have one share and you're a dirty so and so,' says John Dunlop, secretary of labor in the Ford administration, who was involved in the FLOC battle.\\"Waldman, \\"The Best and the Worst of American Unions,\\" Washington Monthly, July‚ÄìAugust 1987. The company's public image began to suffer. FLOC then targeted three members of Campbell's board of directors for economic pressure. FLOC also picketed Philadelphia National Bank, one of Campbell's major creditors. Shortly thereafter, depositors threatened to pull $500,000 out of the bank.\\"Farm Group Boycotting Campbell Puts Focus on Financial Concerns,\\" Associated Press, November 27, 1984. FLOC marches to Camden, New Jersey, to put pressure on the Campbell's Soup Co. In 1985, Campbell's agreed to establish a commission to implement an anti-poverty program among its workers. Chaired by Dunlop, the commission began acting as a labor relations board.The National Labor Relations Act exempts agricultural workers from federal labor law. In the fall of 1985, Campbell's officials agreed to negotiate with FLOC. In February 1986, FLOC, the growers and Campbell's announced a collective bargaining agreement which recognized FLOC as the workers' representative and provided for wage increases, grievance resolution, health insurance, and committees to study pesticide safety, housing, health care, and day care issues. Campbell's agreed to purchase a fixed portion of growers' crops, a guarantee that allowed growers to increase wages without fear that Campbell's would take its business elsewhere. Shortly thereafter, FLOC reached deals with Vlasic, Heinz, Green Bay Foods (now part of Dean Foods), Aunt Jane's (now part of Dean Foods) and Dean Foods. Within a year, FLOC had also signed pacts with 23 of the largest cucumber growers in Ohio and Michigan as well.Schneider, \\"Campbell Soup Accord Ends a Decade of Strife,\\" New York Times, February 24, 1986; Padawer, \\"Campbell's Boycott Brings Home the Settlement,\\" Multinational Monitor, March 15, 1986.Schneider, \\"Farm Pact in Midwest Portends Industry Shift,\\" New York Times, August 7, 1987.Howell, \\"Boycotting Pickles ‚Äì Protesting Treatment of Migrant Workers,\\" Christian Century, January 3, 2001. =Continuing pressure= FLOC continued to address issues related to its collective bargaining agreement in the late 1980s. Midwestern tomato farmers began complaining that the Campbell's Soup pact was not adequate. Campbell's purchased only a portion of their product, but the higher costs of wages and benefits affected their entire crop. Thus, Midwestern growers argued that they could no longer compete with cheap Mexican-grown products. Velasquez contacted Mexican farm worker unions, then in the midst of their own collective bargaining negotiations. Velasquez pressured the Mexican unions to demand significantly higher wages. The strategy was successful: The higher Mexican wages and benefits closed the price differential, and Midwestern growers no longer threatened to break their pact with FLOC. FLOC also fought back against subtle state-sponsored pressure. The union successfully sued the Ohio Highway Patrol (OHP) in September 1996 for stopping Hispanic migrant workers without justification and, in some cases, confiscating green cards. In December 1997, a federal district court judge issued a preliminary injunction restricting the OHP from questioning motorists about immigration status and seizing immigration documents.\\"Midwest, Southeast,\\" Rural Migration News, October 1998. FLOC also began to expand its organizing efforts. The union sought to protect its gains in the cucumber fields by organizing migrant workers in the nation's second-largest cucumber- growing region‚ÄîNorth Carolina. =Mt. Olive Pickle boycott= FLOC began organizing cucumber pickers and pickle processing workers in North Carolina in the early 1990s. The union's efforts had made little headway by the mid-1990s, however. In October 1998, FLOC announced a boycott of Mount Olive Pickle Company, the major pickle processor in the state. The union targeted the pickle processor because it correctly believed that growers would not agree to raise wages unless Mount Olive agreed to pay more for cucumbers. The organizing campaign was a difficult one. Four FLOC organizers were arrested on August 12, 1998 after visiting workers at a tobacco farm in Nash County, North Carolina. A local judge threw out the charges, saying the organizers had broken no laws.Zagier, \\"Pickle Protest Planned,\\" Charlotte News and Observer, October 11, 1998; Lecker, \\"Major Pickle Firm Faces FLOC Boycott in March,\\" Toledo Blade, October 11, 1998; Feehan, \\"FLOC Claims Victory in North Carolina Arrest Case,\\" Toledo Blade, August 15, 1998; Carmen, \\"Organizer of Union for Migrant Workers Takes on Pickle Giant,\\" Columbus Dispatch, January 24, 1999. The union's five-year boycott of Mount Olive Pickle was ultimately successful. A highlight of the organizing drive was a four-day, 70-mile march from Mount Olive, North Carolina, to Raleigh.O'Neill, \\"Where Union Has Gone Before,\\" Sojourners, September‚ÄìOctober 1998. On September 16, 2004, FLOC signed a collective bargaining agreement with Mount Olive and the growers. More than 6,000 of the state's 10,000 guest workers joined FLOC, boosting the union's membership to more than 23,000. The Association covered a number of cash crops, such as Christmas trees and tobacco, in addition to cucumbers.Sengupta, \\"Farm Union Takes Aim at a Big Pickle Maker,\\" New York Times, October 26, 2000; Greenhouse, \\"North Carolina Growers' Group Signs Union Contract for Mexican Workers,\\" New York Times, September 17, 2004. The Mount Olive agreement marked the first time an American labor union represented guest workers. FLOC quickly established a program to bring guest workers into the United States under the H-2A temporary guest worker visa program. FLOC kept the pressure going in North Carolina even after the contract was ratified. In 2001, working with the United Farm Workers, FLOC had sued the United States Department of Labor for failing to force cucumber growers to raise wages for more than 30,000 guest workers.Greenhouse, \\"Unions Say Labor Department Is Ignoring Wage Requirements,\\" New York Times, June 27, 2001. In 2005, the union won its lawsuit. Employers were forced to pay $1.4 million lawsuit to North Carolina workers who had deductions illegally taken from their pay. A federal district court judge ruled that growers belonging to the North Carolina Growers Association had to pay guest workers' visa and transportation fees. The ruling saved guest workers nearly $2 million a year.Mattson, \\"Union Rep's Slaying Called Revenge,\\" San Antonio Express-News, April 13, 2007. FLOC announced a second major organizing drive throughout the Deep South at its triennial convention in September 2006. =Cruz assassination in Mexico= On April 10, 2007, FLOC organizer Santiago Rafael Cruz was found bound and beaten to death in the group's office in Monterrey, Mexico. FLOC had opened an office next to the U.S. consulate in the city in 2005 to help guest workers process their visas and to organize these incoming guest workers into the union. However, when Mexican police announced that a suspect had been arrested in Cruz's death, they stated \\"he died for failing to deliver on a shady $4,500 promise to provide visas for the friends of his alleged killer\\".Mattson, \\"Ex- Con Jailed in April Killing of Farm Labor Organizer,\\" San Antonio Express- News, May 24, 2007. The $4,500 was to arrange for documents for \\"other people so they could go to the United States to work...\\". The group's Monterrey offices had been broken into several times in the past year, and union staff members had received a number of threats. Cruz, who was 29 years old, had supervised the Monterrey office for less than a month. The Nuevo Le√≥n state police said Cruz's murder was not related to trafficking in illegal narcotics, but rather due to \\"a fight between unions\\" or \\"an internal fight\\" within FLOC. FLOC vigorously disputed the findings. FLOC officials claimed that organized crime figures had murdered Cruz in retaliation for FLOC's efforts to resolve grievances concerning abuses in the guest worker recruiting system (which FLOC says are dominated by criminal syndicates). FLOC petitioned the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for protective measures. The Commission immediately granted the petition, which requires that the Mexican government provide FLOC members and staff with adequate law enforcement and security while in Mexico.\\"FLOC Worker from Toledo Killed in Mexico,\\" Toledo Blade, April 11, 2007; Hall, \\"Response to Toledoan's Death,\\" Toledo Blade, April 26, 2007. Two months after Cruz' death, the Mexican government agreed to require local police officers to sign in daily at FLOC's Monterrey office and agreed to install security cameras throughout the building where FLOC's offices are located. FLOC President Velasquez and Representative Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) met with officials from office of the Attorney General of Mexico to resolve problems with the implementation of the new security measures. Although the IACHR has been pressuring the Mexican government since early May to install the cameras, the Nuevo Le√≥n and federal government disagree over who will pay for them. The police officer visits to the union offices also have been less frequent than promised.Seitz, \\"Security Measures for FLOC May Grow,\\" Toledo Blade, July 2, 2007. =R.J. Reynolds Campaign= In 2006, the North Carolina branch of FLOC began its new campaign against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. FLOC president Baldemar Velazquez spoke of the tragic and preventable deaths of at least four migrant tobacco workers in the summer of 2006 in North Carolina. The aim of the new campaign was to put pressure on Big Tobacco executives to change its abusive procurement system. Tobacco corporations have control throughout the levels of tobacco procurement. Due to their monopoly, they control the prices they pay growers, and therefore the wages paid to field workers. There are deceptive layers of subcontractors throughout this system, designed to avoid responsibility for what happens down the chain. Nevertheless, tobacco corporations have the power to change this system and directly improve the lives of the workers who harvest their product. FLOC seeks to change the abusive structure of the procurement system through a multi-party agreement between the corporation, the growers and the farmworkers. Thus far, Reynolds CEO Susan Ivey has refused to meet with FLOC representatives. FLOC continues to put pressure on Reynolds to meet and attended a May 2008 shareholder meeting to raise the issue and to support a shareholder resolution calling for the company to establish a human rights protocol throughout its supply chain. The resolution had the support of the shareholder advisory service ISS and received a significant 13% of the vote.Collins, Kristin. \\"Farm union targets RJR.\\" News & Observer. October 27, 2007. On May 3, 2012, FLOC and several different organizations came together and disrupted a meeting of CEOs at R.J. Reynolds Headquarters, demanding that the crimes of the company against tobacco farmworkers be acknowledged and that certain action be taken to relieve the pain and suffering these workers are enduring in the tobacco fields. The short-term goal was in pressuring them to finally set up a meeting between R.J.R. and FLOC. Their goal was achieved. Soon after the meeting, FLOC and their allies flooded the streets of Winston- Salem, North Carolina, and held a long march to both celebrate their first victory and to continue the ongoing pressure against R.J.R.Murphy, B.J., \\"Winston-Salem picket and march in support of NC tobacco farmworkers\\", Fight Back! News, May 6, 2012. Structure FLOC is governed by its membership. The membership elects delegates, who meet every four years (effective Convention 2009). FLOC held its first membership meeting‚Äîcalled a \\"constitutional convention\\"‚Äîin 1979. Members set dues, approve policy statements and broad programmatic guidance, and elect officers. Currently, FLOC members pay 2.5% of their base wages as dues. Between conventions, FLOC is governed by a Board of Directors. The board includes the three officers‚Äîthe international president, international vice president, and international secretary-treasurer‚Äîand four at-large board members. All board members are elected for four-year terms. At its 11th Constitutional Convention in 2009, delegates elected the following individuals as board members: *Baldemar Vel√°squez, president *Justin Flores, vice president *Beatriz Maya, secretary-treasurer *Diego Reyes, member at large *Angelita Morrisroe, member at large *Belia Garrobo, member at large *Christiana Velasquez, member at large Between executive board meetings, FLOC's day-to-day operations are governed by the three officers, led by the president. FLOC has a number of programs which it has implemented to improve the lives of its members. Since 1971, FLOC has offered educational programs, established food and fuel cooperatives, and run legal clinics for both members and non-members. After it achieved its contract with Campbell's Soup, FLOC sought a charter from the AFL-CIO. The AFL-CIO initially chartered FLOC as a directly affiliated local union. However, in February 2006, FLOC changed its affiliation with the AFL-CIO and became a fully chartered international union. While FLOC has a good working relationship with the United Farm Workers (UFW), neither union has sought merger with the other. In 1993, FLOC president Velasquez expressed doubt that his members would approve a merger.

The Japanese Spitz is a companion dog and pet. There are varying standards around the world as to the ideal size of the breed, but they are always larger than their smaller cousins, the Pomeranian. They were developed in Japan in the 1920s and 1930s by breeding a number of other Spitz type dog breeds together. They are recognized by the vast majority of the major kennel clubs, except the American Kennel Club due to it being of similar appearance to the white Pomeranian, American Eskimo Dog and Samoyed. While they are a relatively new breed, they are becoming widely popular due to their favorable temperament and other features. The major health concern is patellar luxation, and a minor recurring concern is that the breed can be prone to runny eyes. They can act as reliable watchdogs, but are a type of companion dog and prefer to be an active part of the family. Although they might appear fluffy, they are a low maintenance breed as dirt does not stick to the coat.  Appearance  The Japanese Spitz is a small dog, around 33 cm (13 ins) at the withers, with a somewhat square body, deep chest, and a very thick, pure white double coat. The coat consists of an outer coat that stands off from the soft inner coat, with fur shorter on the muzzle and ears as well as the fronts of the forelegs and the hindlegs. A ruff of longer fur is around the dog's neck. It has a pointed muzzle and small, triangular shape prick ears (ears that stand up.) The tail is long, heavily covered with long fur, and is carried curled over and lying on the dog's back. The white coat contrasts with the black pads and nails of the feet, the black nose, and the dark eyes. The large oval (akin to a ginkgo seed) eyes are dark and slightly slanted with white eyelashes, and the nose and lips and eye rims are black. The face of the Japanese Spitz is wedge- shaped. They share a common resemblance with the white Pomeranian, Samoyed and American Eskimo Dog. = Size variations = Male Japanese Spitz (UK) Description of the ideal size of the breed varies. In Japan, the ideal size for males are described as 30‚Äì38 cm at the withers, with females somewhat smaller; (the Japanese standard is the one published by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale for international dog competitions.)the Japanese breed standard translated by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale (DOC file, in English) In the UK, the Kennel Club describes the size as 34‚Äì37 cm (13.5‚Äì14.5 in) at the withers with females 30‚Äì34 cm (12‚Äì13.5 in), which is the same for the Australian National Kennel Council. In New Zealand (New Zealand Kennel Club), the ideal size is 30‚Äì40 cm (12‚Äì16 in) for males, 25‚Äì35 cm (10‚Äì14 in) for females. The Canadian Kennel Club states that the size for dogs is 12 inches (30 cm) with females slightly smaller, and the United Kennel Club in the U.S. describes the ideal size as 12 to 15 ins (30.5‚Äì38.1 cm) for males and 12 to 14 ins (30.5‚Äì35.6 cm) for females. Minor kennel clubs and other organizations may use any of these ideal sizes or create their own. Japanese Spitzes are generally considered larger than their cousin, the Pomeranian. History A four-year-old female Japanese Spitz thumb Dog breeders in Japan in the 1920s and 1930s created the Japanese Spitz by crossbreeding a number of other Spitz breeds to develop the Japanese Spitz.Dog: The Complete Guide, by Sarah Whitehead, Barnes & Noble, Publisher, 1999, pg 211, . Breeders began with white German Spitz dogs, originally brought over from northeastern China to Japan; they were first exhibited at a dog show in Tokyo in 1921.Japanese Spitz breed standard from the Japan Kennel Club (in Japanese) and Japanese Spitz breed standard from Nippon Spitzs Club (in English) Between 1925 and 1936 various small white Spitz breeds were imported from around the world and crossed into the developing breed, with the goal of producing an improved breed. The final Standard for the breed was written after World War II, and accepted by the Japan Kennel Club. The breed gained popularity in Japan in the 1950s, and was exported to Sweden in the early 1950s. From there the breed went to England, and the Kennel Club recognized the Japanese Spitz in 1977 in the Utility Group. The Japanese Spitz has spread around the world including to India, Australia, and the United States and is recognized by most of the major kennel clubs in the English speaking world; by the Canadian Kennel Club in Group 6, Non-Sporting, by the New Zealand Kennel Club (Non- Sporting Group), by the Australian National Kennel Council in Group 7 (Non Sporting), and by the United Kennel Club (U.S.) in the Northern Breeds Group. The American Kennel Club does not recognize the Japanese Spitz due to its being close in appearance to a U.S. developed Spitz breed, the American Eskimo Dog. The breed is also recognized by minor registries and clubs. Health A Japanese Spitz puppy They are a healthy breed with very few genetic problems. The main health concern for Japanese Spitz is the development of Patellar luxation, a condition in which the kneecap dislocates out of its normal position. They can also be prone to runny eyes, which is most commonly due to having tear ducts that are too small, or an allergy to long grass or stress. It is rarely caused by any serious eye defect. = Mortality = Life expectancy is estimated at 10‚Äì16 years. This makes it one of the longest-lived dog breeds. = Temperament = Active, loyal, and bright, the Japanese Spitz are known for their great courage, affection, devotion and amiability making them great watchdogs and ideal companions for older people and small children. Most Japanese Spitz are good watch dogs, despite their relatively small size, and they have a tendency to bark to warn of arriving strangers.New Zealand Kennel Club, Japanese Spitz The Japanese Spitz is first and foremost a companion dog and thrives on human contact and attention, preferring to be a member of the family. They are known as very loyal dogs. They enjoy being active and love to be in the outdoors. They are intelligent, playful, alert, and obedient, and particularly excellent and loving toward children.  Care  Japanese Spitz can tolerate cold weather but, as it was bred as a companion dog, prefers to live in the house with the warmth of its human family. Though they can live in apartments, they need some time running around outside off- leash in a safe environment. = Grooming = A two-year-old Japanese Spitz Due to the texture of their coat, mud and dirt falls off or can be brushed out very easily. However, due to the breed's thick coat, regular brushing is essential. The Japanese Spitz's coat is relatively dry as compared to other breeds. Their coat should be groomed twice a week using a pin brush that reaches to the undercoat, preventing formation of knots. Grooming this breed is relatively easy in contrast to other dog breeds. Their white fur coat has a non-stick texture often described as being similar to Teflon.

It was first published in April 1741 under the name of Mr. Conny Keyber. Fielding never admitted to writing the work, but it is widely considered to be his.. It is a direct attack on the then-popular novel Pamela (1740) by Fielding's contemporary and rival Samuel Richardson and is composed, like Pamela, in epistolary form. Publishing history Shamela was originally published anonymously on 4 April 1741 and sold for one shilling and sixpence. A second edition came out on 3 November that same year which was partly reimpressed and partly reset where emendations were made. A pirated edition was printed in Dublin in 1741 as well. Reprint editions have subsequently appeared as texts for academic study. Plot summary Shamela is written as a shocking revelation of the true events which took place in the life of Pamela Andrews, the main heroine of Pamela. Shamela starts with a letter from a Parson Thomas Tickletext to his friend, Parson J. Oliver, in which Tickletext is completely smitten by Pamela, and insists Oliver gives the book a read. In response, however, Oliver reveals her true nature is not so virtuous, and he has letters to prove her real character. The rest of the story is told in letters between the major characters, such as Shamela, her mother, Henrietta Maria Honora Andrews‚Äîwho is unwed in this version‚ÄîMaster Booby, Mrs. Jeweks, Mrs. Jervis, and Rev. Arthur Williams, much like in Pamela. In this version, however, her father is not present at all. In Shamela we also learn that, instead of being a kind, humble and chaste servant-girl, Pamela (whose true name turns out to be Shamela) is in fact a wicked and lascivious creature‚Äîdaughter to a London prostitute‚Äîwho schemes to entrap her master, Squire Booby, into marriage. Later, however, it was discovered Shamela was having an affair with the Reverend. The verbal and physical violence of Richardson's \\"Mr. B\\" (whose name is revealed to Booby) to his servant maid are hyperbolized, rendering their supposed love-match contemptible and absurd. Themes and style The novel is a sustained parody of, and direct response to, the stylistic failings and moral hypocrisy that Fielding saw in Richardson's Pamela. Reading Shamela amounts to re-reading Pamela through a deforming magnifying glass; Richardson's text is rewritten in a way that reveals its hidden implications, to subvert and desecrate it.Vasarri (2006) p.7 quotation: Davidson (2004) p.134 Richardson's epistolary tale of a resolute servant girl, armed only with her 'virtue' to battle against her master's attempts at seduction, had become an overnight literary sensation in 1741. The implicit moral message ‚Äì that a girl's chastity has eventual value as a commodity ‚Äì as well as the awkwardness of the epistolary form in dealing with ongoing events, and the triviality of the detail which the form necessitates, were some of the main targets of Fielding's travesty. Recent criticism has explored the ways in which Pamela in fact dramatises its own weaknesses. From this perspective, Fielding's work may be seen as a development of possibilities already encoded in Richardson's work, rather than a simple attack. Another novel by Fielding parodying Pamela, albeit not so explicitly, is The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews and his Friend, Mr. Abraham Adams (February 1742), more commonly known as Joseph Andrews. Also, as the title and paratexts make clear, Shamela is also a spoof against Colley Cibber's Apology (An Apology for the Life of Colley Cibber, Comedian), published the same year, as well as a dig at Conyers Middleton, whose Life of Cicero, written at the request of John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey, was perceived by opposition authors as a panegyric of sorts for the controversial administration of Robert Walpole. Some critics have pointed out that the popularity of Richardson's Pamela and Cibber's Apology alerted Fielding to the possibilities of prose fiction for influencing the taste and morals of his contemporaries. Shamela, then, went far beyond satirizing Richardson and his supporters, for it allowed Fielding to rework, now in novelistic format, the topics that fascinated him as a satirical playwright, before the Licensing Act drove him away from drama.

The district is managed by the Superintendent of Schools, and governed by the Berkeley Board of Education, whose members are elected by voters. Its administrative offices are located in the old West Campus main building at 2020 Bonar Street, on the corner of Bonar and University Avenue. History The Berkeley Unified School District was formed in 1936 by the merger of the city's elementary and high school districts.The City of Berkeley, Mary Johnson, 1942, p.56 (typewritten mss in Berkeley Public Library History Room) District administrative offices were originally (in the late 19th century) at or near the Kellogg School (above Shattuck Avenue between Center Street and Allston Way). In 1927, a two- story administration building was completed at 2325 Milvia Street (at the corner of Durant Avenue, across from the grounds of Berkeley High School). Designated a seismic hazard after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, it was put to non-school purposes beginning in 1940Berkeley Daily Gazette, Aug.10, 1944, p.5 and was razed sometime before 1948, the site becoming tennis courts for the high school. In January 1940, administrative offices were moved to 1414 Walnut Street (the original Garfield Jr. High, later University Elementary and the temporary site, after the 1923 fire, of Hillside Elementary). In 1979, the district offices moved to the Old City Hall at 2134 Martin Luther King Way, and in 2012 to 2020 Bonar Street (originally Luther Burbank Junior High School, then Berkeley High School West Campus, and finally the Berkeley Adult School).Campus Project =Integration policy= During and following World War II, the African American population of Berkeley, as in the entire region, increased substantially. However, the practice of racial covenants in property title deeds, together with informal discrimination (\\"de facto\\"), had resulted in the black population being concentrated in certain sections of the city, primarily in the southwestern portions. Consequently, public schools serving those areas had a disproportionately high number of blacks while virtually no blacks attended the schools in other mostly white sections of the city. The only exception to this was Berkeley High School as it was, and remains, the only high school for the entire district. Heightened local interest in the concerns and efforts of the civil rights movement, shared by many in the community, eventually led to the adoption of a voluntary school integration plan starting in the mid 1960s. The plan included the use of bussing to effect an integration of all the public schools in Berkeley. The first schools to be integrated under this plan were the junior high schools, Garfield and Willard, starting in the Fall of 1966. A third junior high school, Burbank, was closed, demolished and rebuilt (by 1968) as the high school's \\"West Campus\\", serving all the district's 9th-grade students. Two years later in the Fall of 1968, the elementary schools were integrated, utilizing the district's own expanded bus fleet. Berkeley's voluntary integration plan, substantially modified, remains in place today. Governance The school district is governed by the Berkeley Board of Education. It consists of five voting members (elected by the city's voters to four-year terms) and two non-voting student directors (elected by the district's high school students).

Naming For those offended by the name SATAN, the software contained a special command called repent, which rearranged the letters in the program's acronym from \\"SATAN\\" to \\"SANTA\\". Description The tool was developed by Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema. Neil Gaiman drew the artwork for the SATAN documentation. SATAN was designed to help systems administrators automate the process of testing their systems for known vulnerabilities that can be exploited via the network. This was particularly useful for networked systems with multiple hosts. Like most security tools, it was useful for good or malicious purposes ‚Äì it was also useful to would-be intruders looking for systems with security holes. SATAN was written mostly in Perl and utilized a web browser such as Netscape, Mosaic or Lynx to provide the user interface. This easy to use interface drove the scanning process and presents the results in summary format. As well as reporting the presence of vulnerabilities, SATAN also gathered large amounts of general network information, such as which hosts are connected to subnets, what types of machines they are and which services they offered. Status SATAN has fallen from popularity after the height of its popularity in the 1990s. SATAN was released in 1995 and development has ceased. In 2006, SecTools.Org conducted a security popularity poll and developed a list of 100 network security analysis tools in order of popularity based on the responses of 3,243 people.

J. Bryan Dorn, was a United States politician from South Carolina who represented the western part of the state in the United States House of Representatives from 1947 to 1949 and from 1951 to 1975 as a Democrat. Early life Dorn was born near Greenwood, South Carolina on April 14, 1916, the son of Thomas Elbert and Pearl Griffith Dorn. Thomas Dorn was a school teacher, principal, and superintendent who hoped his son would have a political career, so he named the boy after William Jennings Bryan. Bryan Dorn attended the public schools of Greenwood and Greenwood High School, and became a farmer. He attended the University of South Carolina where he was a member of the Clariosophic Society. https://digital.tcl.sc.edu/digital/collection/garnetblack/id/22766 He was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1938 and to the South Carolina Senate in 1940. He served in the United States Army Air Forces in Europe during World War II. Congressional career Dorn was first elected to Congress in the 1946 election. In the 1948 election, he unsuccessfully challenged incumbent U.S. Senator Burnet R. Maybank for the Democratic nomination. Maybank won the nomination, and was unopposed in the general election. William Jennings Bryan Dorn (second from left) Dorn returned to the House in the 1950 election, and became known for his work on issues related to the military and the expansion of civil rights. He was a signatory to the 1956 Southern Manifesto that opposed the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education. In 1966, journalist Drew Pearson reported that Dorn was one of a group of Congressman who had received the \\"Statesman of the Republic\\" award from Liberty Lobby for his \\"right-wing activities\\". In his final term he was chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. Candidacy for governor He left Congress to run for Governor of South Carolina in 1974. He lost the Democratic primary to Charles 'Pug' Ravenel, who the South Carolina Supreme Court later ruled ineligible on residency grounds required by the state constitution. A special state convention then chose Dorn as the Democratic candidate. He was defeated in the general election by Republican James B. Edwards, one of the few disappointments in what was generally a big year for Democrats. In 1978, Dorn again sought the Democratic nomination for governor but was eliminated in a three-way race won by Richard Riley. In 1980, he was elected chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, and he served until 1984. After Congress In 1978, President Jimmy Carter named the Columbia, South Carolina, Veteran's Affairs Hospital after Dorn as the \\"William Jennings Bryan Dorn Veterans' Hospital.\\" Dorn died in Greenwood on August 13, 2005.

Range of motion exercises  Range of motion exercise refers to activity aimed to improving movement of a specific joint. This motion is influenced by several structures: configuration of bone surfaces within the joint, joint capsule, ligaments, tendons, and muscles acting on the joint. Range of motion exercises are also called \\"ROM\\" exercises. There are three types of ROM exercises: passive, active, and active assists. Passive range of motion is movement applied to a joint solely by another person or persons or a passive motion machine. When passive range of motion is applied, the joint of an individual receiving exercise is completely relaxed while the outside force moves the body part, such as a leg or arm, throughout the available range. Injury, surgery, or immobilization of a joint may affect the normal joint range of motion. Active range of motion is movement of a joint provided entirely by the individual performing the exercise. In this case, there is no outside force aiding in the movement. Active assist range of motion is described as a joint receiving partial assistance from an outside force. This range of motion may result from the majority of motion applied by an exerciser or by the person or persons assisting the individual. It also may be a half-and-half effort on the joint from each source.

It is also called range of travel (or ROT), particularly when talking about mechanical devices and in mechanical engineering fields. For example, a sound volume control knob. As used in the biomedical field and by weightlifters, range of motion refers to the distance and direction a joint can move between the flexed position and the extended position. The act of attempting to increase this distance through therapeutic exercises (range of motion therapy‚Äîstretching from flexion to extension for physiological gain) is also sometimes called range of motion. Measuring range of motion Each specific joint has a normal range of motion that is expressed in degrees. The reference values for the normal ROM in individuals differ slightly depending on age and gender. For example, as an individual ages, they typically lose a small amount of ROM. Analog and traditional devices to measure range of motion in the joints of the body include the goniometer and inclinometer which use a stationary arm, protractor, fulcrum, and movement arm to measure angle from axis of the joint. As measurement results will vary by the degree of resistance, two levels of range of motion results are recorded in most cases. Recent technological advances in 3D motion capture technology allow for the measurement of joints concurrently, which can be used to measure a patient's active range of motion. Limited range of motion Limited range of motion refers to a joint that has a reduction in its ability to move. The reduced motion may be a problem with the specific joint or it may be caused by injury or diseases such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or other types of arthritis. Pain, swelling, and stiffness associated with arthritis can limit the range of motion of a particular joint and impair function and the ability to perform usual daily activities. Limited range of motion can affect extension or flexion. If there is limited range of extension, it is called \\"Flexion Contracture\\" or \\"Flexion Deformity\\". If the flexion is deficient, it is called \\"Limited Range of Flexion\\" or \\"Limited Flexion Range\\". =Range of motion exercises= Physical and occupational therapy can help to improve joint function by focusing on range of motion exercises. The goal of these exercises is to gently increase range of motion while decreasing pain, swelling, and stiffness. There are three types of range of motion exercises: * Passive Range of Motion (or PROM) - Therapist or equipment moves the joint through the range of motion with no effort from the patient. * Active Assisted Range of Motion (or AAROM) - Patient uses the muscles surrounding the joint to perform the exercise but requires some help from the therapist or equipment (such as a strap). * Active Range of Motion (or AROM) - Patient performs the exercise to move the joint without any assistance to the muscles surrounding the joint.

Traditionally, strongwomen have had a special appeal, as women involved in demonstrated feats of strength were exceptions. Traditional strongwomen Traditionally, strongwomen were featured as performers in a circus, or in vaudeville, music halls, or other venues, and engaged in feats of strength such as barbell lifting and human juggling. Some famous traditional strongwomen include: *Minerva (Josephine Blatt n√©e Wohlford), (c.1869 - 1923) born in New Jersey. *Vulcana (Miriam Kate Williams aka Kate Roberts), (1874 - 1946) born in Abergavenny, Wales. *Charmion (Laverie Vallee n√©e Cooper), (1875 - 1949) born in Sacramento, California. *Katie Sandwina, (1884 - 1952) born in Vienna, Austria. *Joan Rhodes, (1920 - 2010) born in London, England. *Beth Phoenix (1980 ‚Äì) born in Elmira, New York *Macarte Sisters, a British strongwoman act of the late 19th and early 20th- centuries Modern-day strongwomen In recent years, the term strongwoman has come to refer to the women who compete in events such as the annual World's Strongest Woman (WSW) competitions, sanctioned by the International Federation of Strength Athletes (IFSA), and televised nationally on ESPN. Strongwomen compete in the sport of Strongman and the sport has become some popular with female strength athletes over the past decade that there are several state and nationally sanctioned competitions that prepare amateur female athletes for national competitions that allow for the opportunity to compete as professionals. In March 2017, the annual Arnold Classic hosted its first professional female strongman competition. In these contests, the participants compete in the same types of events that can be found in a Strongman competition. Such events include, but are not limited to: * Atlas Stones * Conan's Wheel * Deadlift with various implements such as a barbell, axle, loaded frame, car, etc., all of varying weights * Farmer's Carry * Frame Deadlift and/or Carry * Hercules Hold * H√∫safell Stone * Fingal's Fingers * Keg-tossing * Overhead press using various implements such as an axle, circus dumbbell, log, keg, or block- all of varying weights * Squat (exercise)- of varying weight, often the barbell or axle is loaded with wagon or truck wheels that are larger than standard weighted plates * Tire flip * Vehicle Pull Some notable modern strongwomen include: *Beth Phoenix, WWE Diva *Jill Mills, 2001 and 2002 World's Strongest Woman *Robin Coleman, who took 3rd place in the 2001 WSW competition *Becca Swanson, powerlifting world record holder *Aneta Florczyk, four time winner of the World Strongwoman Championships (2003-2008) *Kristin Rhodes, Strongwoman World Champion 2012, runner-up 2013 and 2008, six time America's Strongest Woman *Heini Koivuniemi, runner-up in the 2001 WSW, third place in 2002 and 2003  Training  Women who compete in Strongman (strongwomen) must be well versed in the styles and techniques that are demonstrated in both powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting as the types of lifts that are performed in both sports are fundamental in strength sports and carry over into the techniques that have been developed for the events that make up a Strongman competition. In addition to developing the proper technique for the foundation lifts, strongwomen must also develop endurance through cardiovascular conditioning training. Being able to adapt to implements (straight barbells versus axle barbells, axle barbells versus logs, etc.) is important as the technique used for the different implements are nuanced and are not readily available at commercial gyms.

The Welland By-pass, completed in 1973, was a massive construction project on the Welland Canal in Ontario, Canada. A new channel long was constructed, providing a shorter, more direct alignment between Port Robinson and Port Colborne and by-passing downtown Welland. The project helped improve navigation along the canal and alleviated problems the presence of a busy ship canal was causing in Welland. Background Although the city of Welland had originally grown around the canal, by the 1960s the constant interruptions in the flow of the vehicular and rail traffic through the city became bothersome. A single ship would hold up traffic for at least ten minutes as it travelled under a vertical lift bridge. In periods of heavy ship traffic, a bridge might stay raised for multiple ships to pass, and long lines of cars, trucks and buses could be delayed more than 30 minutes. Additionally, many railroad yards and lines originally built on Welland's outskirts now found themselves in the middle of a growing city; the heavily used rail lines from Toronto to Buffalo were suffering delays, as well. The old route, established in 1932 with the building of the fourth Welland Canal, was also inconvenient to the ships since it was twisting and narrow. The five vertical lift bridges and a railroad swing bridge, all within close distance of one another, made the manoeuvring tricky and the journey stressful. Captains complained of bulky buildings on the canal's edge blocking the line of sight. One of them commented, \\"The main thing every Lakes captain used to dread was Bridge 15 [built during the 3rd canal era, but in use until 1972], a railway bridge in the town of Welland with an abutment in the middle... I think every captain on the Lakes must have [scraped it] at one time or another.\\" http://www.welland.library.on.ca/digital/clipping/source/bypass/11088.jpg Construction The by-pass project was a massive undertaking: 16.2 km¬≤ (4,000 acres) of land was expropriated for the construction. Approximately 50 million cubic metres of material was excavated. The new channel is wide, as compared to the width of the old channel. The channel's minimum depth is . Two tunnels, the Main Street Tunnel and the Townline Tunnel, were constructed to allow vehicles and trains to pass beneath the canal. To complement this, an aqueduct, to convey the Welland River under the new canal alignment, was built. The aqueduct's design is what is known as a four-tube inverted-syphon culvert, long, wide, and extending below the navigation channel. It was constructed from 30,000 cubic metres of concrete. Approximately of new river channel was constructed to route the river into the aqueduct. The creation of the syphon culvert lowered ground water levels for miles around, the project making many dug wells run dry. The St. Lawrence Seaway Authority denied responsibility, but paid many residents to have a drilled well installed to supply their water. (based on local witnesses) A ship at the Welland Dock. A concrete bank can be seen on the left. In compensation for the loss of canal banks through the city of Welland, parts of which were being used as a docking area by local industries, the project incorporated a dock, separated from the main travel route. Many of the area's rail lines, which had previously been constructed to fit around the existing alignment, had to be dramatically altered for the new alignment. An estimated of new track was laid at a cost of CAD$50 million. A Google map is available which shows the changes to the rail network as a result of the canal relocation, as well as changes made since.https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF&msa;=0&msid;=112122431676358120996.0004404f9b3d6957cb2a7 This map also details the old and new routes of the canal. The construction started with the sinking of the first shovel on June 9, 1967, and continued for six years. (During construction, a giant \\"Earth mover\\" working on the canal, accidentally struck and ruptured a buried natural gas line, which erupted into a torch-like flame approx 90‚Äì100 meters high; there were no injuries.) In a symbolic event watched by many residents, on a snowy night, Bridge #13 on Welland's East Main Street came up for the last time, lighted by floodlights, on December 15, 1972, the new bypass would be open to shipping for the next season. (The bridge was actually quietly opened the next day to allow the passage of a St. Lawrence Seaway service vessel.) The Main Street Tunnel was officially opened on May 20, 1972, with the Townline Tunnel following on July 13. Rail traffic through the Townline Tunnel was inaugurated on January 31, 1973. The new canal was first traversed by the Canadian Coast Guard cutter Griffin on March 27, 1973. The first commercial ship to pass through the by-pass was the M.V. Senneville on March 28, 1973. It carried a cargo of 1,063,868 bushels of barley in transit from Duluth, Minnesota to Port Cartier, Quebec. The official opening ceremony for the Welland By-pass took place on July 14, 1973. Overall, the project cost approximately CAD$188 million. The new channel reduced the length of the canal by and replaced six bridge crossings with the two new tunnels. It reduced the transit time through the Welland Canal by about 30 minutes (5%) as compared to the old alignment. Outcomes The Welland By-pass markedly simplified ship passage along the Welland Canal. The city was no longer dependent on often erratic ship schedules. (For instance, a scheduled city-wide bus service was only instituted after the relocation.) A decision had to be made as to the use of the old alignment. Originally, one of the proposed ideas was for it to be filled in and an extension to Highway 406 be run in it. That never came to be, and instead the old canal was turned over to the city and renamed the Welland Recreational Waterway. Recently, the city has seen the construction of a new Civic Centre, including the city hall and the public library downtown by the old canal. Since the opening of the by-pass, Welland's east side has become a virtual island; separated from the rest of the Niagara Peninsula by the old canal channel to the west and by the by-pass channel to the east.

Anderson is known for his tenure with WWE from 2005‚Äì2009 under the ring name Mr. Kennedy and his work in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling as Mr. Anderson. Anderson started his career on the independent circuit, until he was signed to a development contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and was assigned to Ohio Valley Wrestling, WWE's farm territory. He was promoted to the main roster in 2005. One year after his debut, he won the WWE United States Championship, which he held for 42 days. At WrestleMania 23, he won the 2007 Money in the Bank, a briefcase with a title shot for the promotion's world title. However, he dropped the briefcase to Edge after suffering an injury. Kennedy would remain with the promotion until 2009. In 2010, Anderson signed with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, now Impact Wrestling), where he competed under the ring names Mr. Anderson and Ken Anderson. In 2011, he would win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship twice during a feud (a scripted rivalry) with the villainous group Immortal. After losing the title, he would remain with the promotion as a mid-card wrestler, joining also the villainous faction Aces & Eights at one point, until he departed TNA in 2016. In 2019, Anderson came back to pro wrestling programming when he worked for National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). Anderson opened a wrestling school called The Academy in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 2016, along with Shawn Daivari, Molly Holly, Ariya Daivari, and Arik Cannon. He has also worked occasionally as an actor and starred as Master Chief Petty Officer Carter Holt in the WWE Studios production Behind Enemy Lines: Colombia in 2009.  Early life  Kenneth Anderson was born on March 6, 1976, in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin. His father died on April 13, 2006, from cancer. Anderson graduated from Washington High School in Two Rivers, Wisconsin. During his time there, he excelled at swimming and track and field. He also announced school basketball games and did a radio assignment in his Mass Media class. When doing this, a friend suggested to Anderson to repeat the surnames to make it funnier. That element was eventually used again in his wrestling character when encouraged by Paul Heyman. Before beginning his wrestling career, Anderson worked as a security officer at Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant and a personal trainer. He also served in the United States Army.  Professional wrestling career  =Early career (1999‚Äì2005)= Anderson, under the ring name \\"Two Rivers Jack,\\" made his debut on September 11, 1999, at a North American Wrestling Federation event in Whitewater, Wisconsin, losing to Golga. He wrestled just twenty-one matches before appearing for the World Wrestling Federation on Jakked in 2001, where he lost to Essa Rios. He occasionally worked as enhancement talent for WWF when shows ran in Wisconsin. Anderson also made an appearance on NWA: Total Nonstop Action's secondary television program, Xplosion. The owner of the promotion, Jeff Jarrett, approached him for a contract but communications broke down. =World Wrestling Entertainment=  Ohio Valley Wrestling (2005)  Upon signing with WWE in February 2005, Anderson was sent to the Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) developmental territory, where he would remain for six months. When he arrived, Jim Cornette was in charge of the organization and, according to Anderson, did not see potential in his abilities and declined to feature him as more than an occasional bit-player on OVW's programming. When Cornette departed, his replacement, Paul Heyman, showed immediate interest in Anderson, comparing his qualities to The Rock and Steve Austin. Five weeks later, Anderson was called up to WWE's main roster to work on Velocity. He credits Heyman with helping him develop the character with which he would achieve success. Before his first SmackDown! match, he showed himself to be a cocky and arrogant wrestle by taking a microphone and performing his own ring announcement. He referred to himself as \\"Mr. Anderson\\" for this match. A few weeks later, to avoid comparisons with the more famous Anderson family (as well as former Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Ken Anderson), he changed his name to \\"Ken Kennedy,\\" or \\"Mr. Kennedy.\\" The change was initially suggested by Heyman and was chosen because it is the middle name of WWE Chairman Vince McMahon.  United States Champion (2005‚Äì2007)  Kennedy taunting ring announcer alt=Kennedy taunting ring announcer Tony Chimel Kennedy, as a heel, defeated Funaki in his SmackDown! debut on August 25. Kennedy also created an ongoing mini-feud with SmackDown! ring announcer Tony Chimel based on Kennedy believing that Chimel's announcing was not done well enough or with sufficient respect, and therefore performing his own introductions or forcing Chimel to introduce him again. Kennedy's self-ring introductions before the match became one of his trademarks. While working on both Velocity and SmackDown!, he was also still working in OVW. Kennedy made his pay-per-view debut at No Mercy, defeating Hardcore Holly and injuring Holly's ribs during the match. On the November 11 episode of SmackDown!, Kennedy faced Eddie Guerrero to compete for a spot on SmackDown!'s Survivor Series team. He lost the match when Guerrero tossed him a steel chair and played possum, a move which Guerrero had made famous. The referee turned around and saw Guerrero on the ground with Kennedy holding the chair, and consequently disqualified Kennedy, awarding the place on Team SmackDown! to Guerrero. This was Kennedy's first loss. In retaliation, Kennedy struck Guerrero over the head with the chair after the match. This was Guerrero's final televised match, as he died two days later. In interviews about the incident, Kennedy has stated that he considers this an \\"unfortunate honor\\". In December, Kennedy participated in WWE's overseas tour. On the second day in Italy, Kennedy suffered a legitimate latissimus dorsi tear. Kennedy was sidelined for nearly six months while he rehabilitated the injury. He continued to make appearances on SmackDown! and Velocity throughout January and February and even made an appearance on the January 11, 2006, episode of WWE Byte This! with Todd Grisham to maintain visibility. alt=Mr. Kennedy's trademark ring announcement At the OVW tapings on May 17, Kennedy returned to in-ring action, facing OVW Heavyweight Champion CM Punk in a title match that Kennedy lost.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=6400 Kennedy made his return to SmackDown! on the June 9 episode with a victory over Scotty 2 Hotty after using the \\"Kenton Bomb.\\" On the July 14 episode of SmackDown!, Matt Hardy used a roll-up to defeat Kennedy, ending Kennedy's streak of never being defeated by pin or submission. On the July 21 episode of SmackDown!, Batista put out an open challenge to find an opponent for The Great American Bash, as his original opponent, Mark Henry, had been injured. Kennedy accepted the challenge and won the match by disqualification, however, he suffered a injury during the match after being thrown headfirst into the steel steps, resulting in an exposed cranium laceration which required twenty stitches to close. Kennedy helped Vince and Shane McMahon in their feud with D-Generation X, appearing at both SummerSlam and the August 28 episode of Raw to attack them. On the September 1 episode of SmackDown!, Kennedy defeated Finlay and Bobby Lashley in a triple threat match to win the WWE United States Championship, his first and only championship reign in WWE. On the September 8 episode of SmackDown!, Kennedy announced that he wanted to move over to the Raw brand, as SmackDown! did not interest him anymore since he had already defeated every top performer on the roster. This led to SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long making a match between Kennedy and The Undertaker, who Kennedy had never faced, to be held at No Mercy. Kennedy won the match by disqualification.

It is also romanized as Siauw, Shiao, Sjauw, Siaw, Siew, Siow, Seow, Siu or Sui, as well as Shaw in less common situations, inspired by the transliteration of the surname of notable figures such as Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw and English actor Robert Shaw.

After the demise of the Qing dynasty, some of the descendants of Manchu clan ≈†umuru sinicized their clan name to the Chinese surnames Shu (Ëàí), Xu (Âæê) or Xiao (Ëï≠). A 1977 study found that it was the 20th most common Chinese surname in the world. It is said to be the 30th most common in China.Origin of Xiao, Siu, Siew, Seow, Hsiao, yutopian.com. Retrieved 2009-09-23. In 2019 it was the 33rd most common surname in Mainland China.http://www.bjnews.com.cn/news/2020/01/20/676822.html History =In mainland China= The Xiao surname originated from Xiao County in Anhui province, China. In the state of Song during the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China, the nobleman Daxin (Ëï≠ÂèîÂ§ßÂøÉ) was enfeoffed at Xiao, which became an attached state of Song. The people of Xiao later adopted the name of their state as their surname. Centuries later, Xiao He was the first prime minister of the Han dynasty. Later on, his descendant Xiao Biao (ËêßÂΩ™) moved to Lanling (ÂÖ∞Èôµ), now Yicheng in Shandong province, due to political problems during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han. The Xiao people therefore also trace their origin to Lanling, and sometimes they are called Lanling Xiao (‚ÄúÂÖ∞ÈôµËêß‚Äù). Another mass movement of Xiao people came during the Disaster of Yongjia at the end of the Western Jin dynasty, when Xiao Zheng (ËêßÊï¥) moved to Danyang, Jiangsu. It was also called South Lanling (ÂçóÂÖ∞Èôµ). The descendants of Danyang Xiao (‰∏πÈò≥ËêßÊ∞è) later founded two dynasties: Xiao Daocheng was the founding emperor of the Southern Qi dynasty, and Xiao Yan founded the Liang dynasty. During the Tang dynasty, there were nine Xiao family members appointed as chancellors (or prime ministers), the continuous eight chancellors (ÂÖ´Âè∂‰º†Ëä≥, \\"ÂÖ´Âè∂‰∏ñÂÆ∂\\"). The first was Xiao Yu (ËêßÁëÄ), followed by the other eight Xiao families: :his great grand nephew Xiao Song(ËêßÂµ©) :Xiao Song's eldest son Xiao Hua (ËêßÂçé) :Xiao Hua's nephew Xiao Fu (ËêßÂæ©) :Xiao Hua's grandson Xiao Fu (Ëêß‰øØ, written with a different character for Fu) :Xiao Fu's grandson Xiao Zhen (ËêßÁúü) :Xiao Hua's grandson Xiao Fang (Ëêß‰ªø) :Xiao Fang's son Xiao Gou (ËêßÈÅò). There were altogether nine chancellors from the Xiao family during the Tang dynasty. Wuyuan The Jiang family (Ê±üÊ∞è) from Jiangwan (Ê±üÊπæ), Wuyuan, Jiangxi was originally surnamed Xiao and they call themselves the Xiao‚ÄìJiang family (ËêßÊ±üÊ∞è). The Xiao-Jiang family was from Danyang (‰∏πÈò≥ (ÂçóÂÖ∞Èôµ) ‰∏úÂüéÈáåËêßÊ∞è). When the Later Liang dynasty overthrew the Tang dynasty in 907, the Tang general Xiao Zhen (ËêßÊ°¢) led a revolt against the Later Liang dynasty but failed. Xiao Zhen was the second son of the Tang chancellor Xiao Gou. The Xiao family left Danyang and escaped to the south. They changed their surname to Jiang; Xiao Zhen (ËêßÊ°¢) became Jiang Zhen (Ê±üÊ°¢) and he was the progenitor of the Xiao‚ÄìJiang family. They later moved to Yunwan (‰∫ëÊπæ, which changed the name to Jiangwan Ê±üÊπæ). This means that the Jiang family from this area is actually also part of the Xiao family, they are known as the Xiao-Jiang family. Former CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin is a member of the Xiao-Jiang family. During the Southern Song dynasty, Xiao Guoliang (ËêßÂõΩÊ¢Å) was the first member of the Xiao family in Zhangzhou, Fujian province. His grandson, Xiao Xun (ËêßÊ¥µ) became the county magistrate of Chaoyang in Guangdong province. He became the founder of the Xiao family of Chaoyang. During this period, some members of the Xiao family moved across the sea to Taiwan. During the Yuan dynasty, members of the Xiao family moved from Jiangxi to Meizhou and Dabu in Guangdong province. They are mainly the Hakka Xiao family. In the early Ming dynasty, the population in North and Central China was declining due to wars. In order to increase the population and start the economic recovery of these war-torn areas, the Ming government organized many large- scale forced mass migration to the area. People were moved from Shanxi province, which had been less affected by the wars, to the war-torn, less- populated area of North and Central China. The people were ordered to move to a location near \\"the tree\\" (Â§ßÊßêÊ†ë), and prepare themselves for the family migration. The Shanxi Xiao family were part of this group of \\"immigrants under the tree\\" (Âú®Â§ßÊßêÊ†ë‰∏ãÈõÜ‰∏≠ÁßªÊ∞ë), which were moved to the modern provinces of Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shanxi and other places. Today, the Xiao family still has memorial tablets dedicated to their ancestors among the \\"immigrants under the tree\\" at the fourth cabinet of the memorial hall at the \\"large tree roots memorial garden\\" (Â§ßÊßêÊ†ëÂØªÊ†πÁ•≠Á•ñÂõ≠Á•≠Á•ñÂ†ÇÂõõÂè∑‰æõÊ©±). During the Ming dynasty, many members of the Xiao family also moved to Yunnan province. They became the first members of the Yunnan Xiao family (‰∫ëÂçóËêßÊ∞è). During the Ming and Qing dynasties, there were also mass migrations of Xiao kinspeople from Jiangxi to Sichuan, especially at the beginning of these dynasties, when two major revolutions took place. Historians have called this process of mass migration \\"Jiangxi filled Huguang, Huguang filled Sichuan\\" (Ê±üË•øÂ°´ÊπñÂπøÔºåÊπñÂπøÂ°´ÂõõÂ∑ù). \\"Huguang\\" refers to the provinces of Hunan and Guangdong. According to historical materials, from the beginning of the reign of the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty, many members of the Xiao family moved to Sichuan. During the Chinese Civil War between the Communists and the Nationalists, Xiao people, especially those from Fujian, moved to Taiwan with the Nationalists. In Taiwan, they lived primarily in the cities and counties of Changhua, Chiayi, Taipei, Kaohsiung and Taoyuan. Today, Xiao is the 30th-most common surname in Taiwan. The World Congress of was held in Chaoyang, Guangdong province, China in 2010. =Overseas= At the end of the Qing dynasty, Chinese started to move to other countries to work there. The Xiao also moved to other countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. Others migrated from Fujian to Taiwan. In Malaysia and Singapore, direct transliterations from the various Chinese dialects were used to write Chinese surnames. The Hokkien or Teochew Chinese romanized \\"Xiao\\" as \\"Seow\\". Teochew \\"Seow\\" are mainly Xiao from Chaoyang in Guangdong province. The Hakka Xiao, especially Huizhou Hakka of Titi (Áü•Áü•Ê∏Ø) (in Negeri Sembilan state of Malaysia), a village with a high concentration of Hakka people surnamed Xiao, romanized \\"Xiao\\" as \\"Siow\\" or \\"Seow\\". These days, some members of younger generations use hanyu pinyin and write their surname as \\"Xiao\\". In the United States, the surname is also, albeit less commonly, romanized as \\"Shaw\\".  Simplified Chinese forms  The traditional surname Ëï≠ is currently represented by three different characters derived from traditional Chinese (Ëï≠), simplified Chinese (Ëêß), and the rescinded second-round simplification (ËÇñ). Hong Kong, Malaysia and Taiwan maintain traditional Chinese characters and therefore write Ëï≠. In mainland China and Singapore, where simplified Chinese is used, most linguistics agree the surname should be written as Ëêß.Âßì‚ÄúËêß‚ÄùËøòÊòØÂßì‚ÄúËÇñ‚ÄùÔºü (Simplified Chinese) However, many people in mainland China still have ËÇñ as their surname in their legal documents for historical reasons (see below). In mainland China, people may regard them as two separate surnames. However, in circumstances where traditional Chinese is used, e.g. in cross-strait relations, this may lead to confusion. People have long been writing the surname ËÇñ for simplicity, but the form was considered informal and not used in formal texts. However, the second-round Chinese simplification established ËÇñ as the standard form. When the second-round simplification was rescinded in 1984, some people restored their surname in legal documents to the traditional writing form, but some others did not. Most other surnames do not share these problems. For example, Liao (Âªñ) was simplified to a character with Âπø and ‰∫Ü combined in the second-round simplification. All Liao people reverted to using Âªñ after the rescission, because the modification is no longer considered a valid character and cannot be typed into the computer. However, ËÇñ, which has other meanings, is still valid so some people have continued to use this form including in legal documents.

Plot Screenshot of the game showing the inventory and user interface (UI) Siege of Avalon takes place in the fictional land of Eurale. Within Eurale are seven kingdoms: Nisos, Aratoy, Oriam, Fornax, Elythria, Cathea, and Taberland. The seven kingdoms united to the citadel of Avalon as a central capital of the alliance. Within Eurale is a nomadic race called the Sha'ahoul. The Sha'ahoul, led by the leader Mithras, declared war on the seven kingdoms, ultimately besieging the city of Avalon. The protagonist of the game is the playable character, which the user can customize and name. The protagonist arrives in Avalon by boat, several years into the siege. The protagonist's brother, Corvus, is already present within the castle when the players begins the game. The course of the gameplay follows the player through various quests related to maintaining Avalon's defenses and foiling plots to overtake the castle. The game climaxes in a battle between the player and Mithras, the leader of the Sha'ahoul, after the invading force breaks through the outer wall of Avalon.

Early life, family and education Lwin was born in Rangoon, Burma to a Burmese father and an English mother. Bow Wow Wow =EMI records= After recording Dirk Wears White Sox as members of Adam and the Ants, Matthew Ashman and Dave Barbarossa plus new Ants bassist Leigh Gorman (who had replaced Andy Warren since the sessions) were convinced by former Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren to leave Adam Ant to form a new band under his management. Liverpool session musician, music director and talent scout Dave Fishel heard thirteen year old Lwin singing along to the radio at the laundromat where she worked, and convinced McLaren to audition her for lead singer of his new band. Following her successful audition, he had her transfer from a mixed comprehensive school in London to the Sylvia Young Theatre School. Bow Wow Wow signed with EMI Records in July 1980, and released their first single, \\"C¬∑30 C¬∑60 C¬∑90 Go!\\", shortly afterwards. Originally only released on cassette, it was the world's first-ever cassette single. EMI did not promote the cassingle due to lyrics (\\"Off the radio I get constant flow/Hit it, pause it, record and play/Turn it, rewind and rub it away\\") that promoted home taping during an era when music piracy was a hot button issue and the use of cassette recorders to record music from the radio was still a controversial practice. The B-side, \\"Sun, Sea and Piracy\\", also promoted home taping, then lying on a beach and enjoying the fruits of this labour. Both tracks were on side 1 of the tape, making the second side blank, apparently so that the listener could follow Lwin's lead. =RCA Records= When Bow Wow Wow moved to RCA Records, controversy followed them over to their new label. The album cover of their debut album, See Jungle! See Jungle! Go Join Your Gang Yeah, City All Over! Go Ape Crazy! depicted the band recreating √âdouard Manet‚Äôs Le D√©jeuner sur l‚Äôherbe, with a then fourteen-year-old Lwin posing nude. Photographed by Andy Earl, the cover caused outrage that led to an investigation by Scotland Yard, instigated by Lwin's mother. Undeterred, the band used the same photo on the cover of their follow-up EP The Last of the Mohicans, and the sleeve of the \\"Go Wild in the Country\\" single. Another nude photo of Lwin was used for the cover of I Want Candy less than a year later. The title track, a cover of the Strangeloves' 1965 hit originally on The Last of the Mohicans. The single reached No. 9 in the UK Singles Charts in June 1982. At the behest of Ashman, Lwin began writing for Bow Wow Wow's follow up, When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going. When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going contained the hit \\"Do You Wanna Hold Me?\\", which received heavy rotation on MTV. During a hiatus following an intense US tour, Lwin was suddenly fired from the band in September 1983. She found out about her firing by reading it in NME. =Reunion to the present= Lwin and former Bow Wow Wow bass player Leigh Gorman reunited in 1997 for a US tour. The reunion included appearances by a range of musicians from the young up and coming, such as Eshan Khadaroo of Beat Kitchen, (Blue Man), and the established, including Adrian Young of No Doubt, both playing drums in place of original member Dave Barbarossa. The original guitarist of Bow Wow Wow, Matthew Ashman, had died of complications from diabetes in 1995, and various guitarists filled in. The tour began in December 1997, and ended in March 1998. Two shows, the 10 January 1998 show at the Bluebird Theater in Denver, Colorado, and the 7 March 1998 show at the Drama Club in Santa Fe, New Mexico, were used for a live CD, Wild in the U.S.A. on Cleopatra Records. In 1998, Bow Wow Wow collaborated with DJ Swedish Egil on the track \\"Eastern Promise\\", released as part of Egil's Groove Radio Presents: Alternative Mix CD on Priority Records. They contributed the song \\"A Thousand Tears\\" to the 1999 film Desperate But Not Serious (retitled Reckless + Wild in the US), starring Christine Taylor and Claudia Schiffer, and appeared in the film. In 2006, Bow Wow Wow recorded a cover of the Smiths' \\"I Started Something I Couldn't Finish\\", which appeared on three 2007 releases: a new three-track I Want Candy EP (Cleopatra), compilation album Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before: A Tribute to the Smiths (Cleopatra) and the Blood & Chocolate: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (Lakeshore Records). On 21 November 2010, the 15th anniversary of Ashman's death, Barbarossa joined Lwin and Gorman at the Scala in London in a tribute concert for Ashman. The show was headlined by Adam Ant, and also featured Ashman's other bands, Chiefs of Relief and Agent Provocateur. With a new guitarist (Jimmy Magoon) and drummer (Dylan Thomas), Bow Wow Wow played shows in California, US and toured the UK during 2011‚Äì2012. In December 2012, Gorman began performing under the name \\"Bow Wow Wow\\" with Chloe Demetria of the band Vigilant on vocals, and launched a new Bow Wow Wow Facebook page. All of which was done without Lwin's consent. Lwin has continued to perform billed as \\"Annabella Lwin of the original Bow Wow Wow\\". Bow Wow Wow songs \\"Aphrodisiac\\", \\"I Want Candy\\" and \\"Fools Rush In\\" (the latter two remixed by Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine) were included on the soundtrack of the 2006 Sofia Coppola film Marie Antoinette. Lwin was also the inspiration for how Coppola had lead actress Kirsten Dunst portray the title character. The band performed on 2 November 2006 at the Maritime Hotel's Hiro Lounge in New York City to promote the film. Solo and other ventures Lwin has recorded original material as a solo artist, and is a featured vocalist on numerous transatlantic dance tracks with producers/DJs, such as Tony B of Groove Radio, Jason Nevins, and the Utah Saints. Lwin's songwriting also brought her into partnerships with producers such as Guy Chambers and Michael Lattanzi. Simply calling herself \\"Annabella\\", she remained with RCA Records. Her first solo release was the 1985 single \\"Don't Dance With Strangers\\", produced by the System. She followed that up with the album Fever in 1986. The title track, a cover of the Peggy Lee classic, was produced by and recorded with multi- instrumentalist Jim Lea of Slade. Another single from the album, \\"War Boys\\", produced by John Robie, spent six weeks on the US Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, peaking at No. 28. \\"Don't Dance With Strangers\\" and \\"Fever\\" were included on The Best of Bow Wow Wow, released on 29 October 1996 by BMI. She formed a new band, Naked Experience, and collaborated across the Atlantic with seasoned musicians and songwriters such as Billy Steinberg and Ellen Shipley. In 1994, Sony Soho Square released two singles, \\"Car Sex\\" and \\"Do What You Do\\", for which, she was billed as \\"Annabella Lwin\\". \\"Car Sex\\" made the Top 10 in the UK Dance Chart, while the re-mixed dance follow-up \\"Do What You Do\\" (1995), produced by Steve Lironi, spent one week at No.61 in the UK Singles Chart. In 1999, Cleopatra released Virgin Voices: A Tribute To Madonna, Volume One. It contained a cover of \\"Like a Virgin\\" credited to \\"Annabella Lwin of Bow Wow Wow.\\" In 2005, Lwin was a featured vocalist, with Camp Freddy members Dave Navarro and Billy Morrison, during a fund raising concert for victims of the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Lwin co-wrote and co-produced a solo song with record producer Carey Beare, which was donated exclusively to the Hands and Hearts Organization for Tsunami Relief in spring 2006. Amongst a couple of her own shows in 2010, Lwin appeared on stage with Kathy Valentine and Charlotte Caffey (Go-Go's), Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins), and other prominent artists for a MusiCares Musicians Assistance Program (MAP) Benefit concert called 'Women in Recovery', as well as participating in animal charity related concerts. On 10 July 2012, Lwin released Super Boom on Secret Records. It was a fourteen-track collection of unreleased demo and studio recordings from 1984 through to 1987. In 2016, she released a new EP, entitled Willow Tree, on which she wrote all four tracks. Later in the year, she contributed a cover of \\"Cheer Up\\" to One Heart: A Tribute to Bob Marley & the Wailers, a benefit for teens and young adults with cancer or who are living in difficult circumstances.

He is best known as the lead singer of Bosnian and Yugoslav rock bands Divlje jagode from 1979 to 1986 and Bijelo Dugme from 1986 to 1989. Biography =Early life= Islamoviƒá Alen to Bosniak parents in Bihaƒá, found in the northwestern part of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina. Until Islamoviƒá was two and a half years of age his family lived in the small village of Sokolac, near Bihaƒá. However, when his father found work in Bihaƒá the whole family moved to the city. Islamoviƒá first accessed music through his brother who brought a gramophone home in the late 1960s. He learned to play guitar guided by his elder brother, and in 1974 he began playing bass guitar in a band called Bag. He started singing because his brother had many LP records, allowing him to learn the lyrics. Soon, Islamoviƒá's local popularity grew as did his band's gig activity and he performed many concerts in the local region. In addition to Bihaƒá, Bag performed in Prijedor, Drvar, Sanski Most, and Banja Luka, earning decent money. He was inspired by the music of Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Bijelo Dugme. =Divlje jagode= When his band dissolved, Islamoviƒá started playing football in Jedinstvo from Bihaƒá, then a second league club. After he served the army, Sead Lipovaƒça, lead guitarist and founder of Divlje jagode, invited him to join the band. The start with Divlje jagode was very difficult, but it eventually paid off as the band became a very successful hard rock act throughout many parts of Yugoslavia. They were so promising that in April 1984 (when ≈Ωeljko Bebek left Bijelo Dugme) Islamoviƒá turned down Goran Bregoviƒá's offer to sing in Bijelo Dugme (this was partly result of his fear that Bebek might return to Dugme). Eventually, when everything failed, Divlje jagode fell apart and Islamoviƒá returned to Bihaƒá and decided to get a traditional job and quit music. But then came another offer from Goran Bregoviƒá (when Mladen Vojiƒçiƒá Tifa left Dugme) and this time he accepted. =Bijelo Dugme= At the time, the vocal capabilities of Islamoviƒá were questioned when it came to comparasion with the former two singers. Bregoviƒá reportedly invited Islamoviƒá to join the band mainly for his healthy lifestyle (he allegedly stated that he had enough of drunkards and drug addicts). He was right, and Islamoviƒá didn't let fame get to him. After each tour he returned home to Bihaƒá where he'd run his bar, fish, and play table tennis. In 1989, Islamoviƒá left the Bijelo Dugme tour without notifying anybody from the band. He returned home in order to cure a kidney problem he developed on the road, forcing the cancellation of the rest of the tour. Although it seemed like a minor postponement at the time, it actually turned out to be the end of Bijelo Dugme. Soon the war started and the band went into a 15-year hiatus. In total, Islamoviƒá recorded two studio albums with the group, Pljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo in 1986 and ƒÜiribiribela in 1988 and one live album called Mramor, kamen i ≈æeljezo in 1987. Joining Bijelo Dugme, Islamoviƒá instantly became one of the most famous and recognizable musicians in Yugoslavia and in the whole region. =Post-Dugme= After getting back to good health, Islamoviƒá initially used this time off to record a 1989 solo album Haj, nek se ƒçuje, ƒçuje, haj, nek se zna. Except for the title song, the record received a lukewarm public response and was soon forgotten. When the Bosnian War started, he fled Bihaƒá for Zagreb and recorded three albums there with mediocre results before returning to Bihaƒá with the end of the war. Islamoviƒá then took part in a duet with popular turbofolk singer Indira Radiƒá on her album Pocrnela burma in 2002. The song they recorded together, \\"Lopov\\", went on to become a huge commercial hit. He would later do two more duets with her: the 2007 song \\"Imali smo, nismo znali\\" for her album Lepo se provedi and again for a single in 2011 called \\"Ljubav stara\\". In between his work with Radiƒá, in 2005, Islamoviƒá took part in three large farewell concerts with Bijelo Dugme in Sarajevo, Zagreb and Belgrade. It was the band's first live appearance since 1989. He also played rhythm guitar and sang in the band \\"4 Asa\\" with Vlado Kalember, Slavko Pintariƒá \\"Pi≈°ta\\", Rajko Dujmiƒá, and Jurica Paƒëen. Islamoviƒá released the song \\"Mrtvo hladno\\" in February 2005 and the full album of the same name was released in April 2005 with a Canadian band called \\"Srƒçani Udar\\" (English translation: \\"Heart Attack\\"). The album featured 11 songs and a DVD bonus with two music videos and a 30-minute documentary \\"in the making\\". In October 2006, Islamoviƒá joined ≈Ωeljko Bebek and Mladen Vojiƒçiƒá Tifa in a Bijelo Dugme tribute band called \\"B.A.T. Together\\". They performed on numerous stages around the world between 2006 and 2010. B.A.T.'s 2006 U.S.-Canadian tour was filmed for a documentary titled B.A.T.: Balkan Rock Nostalgia, directed by Branislav R. Tataloviƒá. =Present years= During 2012, a new single, \\"Heroin\\", along with two music videos, was released. It was written by Dejan ƒêurkoviƒá \\"Englez\\", lead guitar player of \\"Srƒçani Udar\\". This was an announcement for Islamoviƒá's next studio album. On 15 August 2013, Islamoviƒá appeared at the Belgrade Beer Fest, with Kad bi bio Bijelo Dugme band, performing Bijelo Dugme songs, as well as his own solo material. This was his first large Belgrade show after many years, and second in front of thousands of people, after the Bijelo Dugme concert at Belgrade Hippodrome in 2005. In 2014, Islamoviƒá released his new studio album entitled Alcatraz. This was his first new material since 2005 and the album Mrtvo Hladno with \\"Srƒçani Udar\\". The album was released in March through City Records. Islamoviƒá, along with Goran Bregoviƒá, united once again in June 2014 for a Bijelo Dugme live concert at Ljubljana. What was initially planned as a 40th-anniversary reunion tour throughout entire region, came down only to the two of them, after financial disagreement with other members. After a successful show in front of more than 10,000 people, the entire tour was planned, being later on performed in Europe and the United States, with Islamoviƒá and Bregoviƒá as the only members. In 2017, Islamoviƒá, along with Tifa, Bregoviƒá, and Bregoviƒá's Wedding and Funeral Orchestra, reunited for a United States tour under the Bijelo Dugme moniker.

It was published July 16, July 26, and August 9, 1788 under the pseudonym Publius, the name under which all The Federalist Papers were published. The official title of the work is \\"Certain General and Miscellaneous Objections to the Constitution Considered and Answered\\". Federalist 84 is best known for its opposition to a Bill of Rights, a viewpoint that the work's other author, James Madison, disagreed with. Madison's position eventually won out in Congress and a Bill of Rights was ratified on December 15, 1791. Content Federalist No. 84 is notable for presenting the idea that a Bill of Rights was not a necessary component of the proposed United States Constitution. The constitution, as originally written, is to specifically enumerate and protect the rights of the people. It is alleged that many Americans at the time opposed the inclusion of a bill of rights: if such a bill were created, they feared, this might later be interpreted as a list of the only rights that people had. Hamilton wrote: Hamilton continued in this essay on defending the notion that a bill of rights is unnecessary for the Constitution when he stated, \\"There remains but one other view of this matter to conclude the point. The truth is, after all the declamation we have heard, that the constitution is itself in every rational sense, and to every useful purpose, A BILL OF RIGHTS. The several bills of rights, in Great-Britain, form its constitution, and conversely, the constitution of each state is its bill of rights. And the proposed constitution, if adopted, will be the bill of rights of the union.\\" Hamilton‚Äôs argument is ultimately that a bill of rights should not be added to the Constitution, because the entire Constitution is in itself a bill of rights. Hamilton's belief is that the entire document, U.S. Constitution, should set limits and checks and balances on the government so that no individual‚Äôs rights will be infringed upon.

It is affiliated with the Baptist Convention of New York and endorsed by the Baptist Convention of Pennsylvania/South Jersey. History 249x249pxDavis College was founded in April 1900 by evangelist Reverend John Adelbert Davis. Rev. Davis wanted to start a school similar to his alma mater, Moody Bible Institute, located in Chicago. He taught the first classes at what was then known as Practical Bible School with an enrollment of about 80 to 90 students. The school's first classes were held in an upper level of a store in Lestershire (Johnson City), New York. Davis College is now located at the former location of the White City Amusement Park. In 1910, the park went bankrupt, and Rev. Davis purchased the property. Practical Bible Training School moved to the address one year later. Davis died on Saturday, March 17, 1934. His oldest son, Gordon Carr Davis, became the president and Practical Bible Training School changed its legal name to the John A. Davis Memorial Bible School. In 1993, it was renamed Practical Bible College. In August 2004, the college became Davis College in honor of its founder John A. Davis. =Presidents= *John R.

Davis College was first regionally accredited in June 2005 by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools and accredited nationally by The Association for Biblical Higher Education in 1985. Specialized ministry programs include Pastoral Studies, Youth Ministries, Teaching English as a Second Language, Christian Ministries, Intercultural Studies, Music and Worship, and Organizational Leadership. The College also offers a \\"4 Plus 1\\" Elementary Education articulation agreement allowing graduates from the Christian Ministries program to pursue a MsEd in Childhood Education at a Christian university. This provides certification that is reciprocal in 48 states, including New York and Florida, allowing graduates to teach in both public and private schools. One year certificates are also offered in Bible and Teaching English as a Second Language. In 2012, Davis College purchased Blessed Sacrament Church, which was heavily damaged by flooding in 2011. This acquisition provided the school with its first distinct chapel. In addition, the college hopes to renovate and utilize this property for offices, classrooms, guest speaker housing, and The Practical Institute.

Although its origins date to its foundation in 1827 by the Swiss Evangelical Reformed Church, the name \\"English Cemetery\\" results from the majority of its burials being of Anglicans and Protestants from the British and American communities of Florence. and who gave the largest sum of money for the purchase of its land. The cemetery also holds the bodies of non-English speaking expatriates who died in Florence, among them Swiss and Scandinavians, as well as Eastern Orthodox Christians, among them Russians and Greeks. The cemetery is still owned by the Swiss Evangelical Reformed Church, and is open for the interment of cremated ashes, now of all denominations, but no longer for burials. History Before 1827, non- Catholics who died in Florence were buried in the Old English Cemetery, Livorno of the Nations, the city then known to English-speakers as Leghorn. (The Jewish monumental cemetery had been established in 1777.) In 1827 the Swiss Evangelical Reformed Church acquired land outside the medieval wall and gate of Porta a' Pinti from Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany for an international and ecumenical cemetery, Russian and Greek Orthodox burials joining the Protestant ones. Carlo Reishammer, then a young architectural student, landscaped the cemetery, then Giuseppe Poggi shaped it as its present oval when Florence became capital of Italy in 1865. He surrounded it with studios for artists, including that of Michele Gordigiani, who painted the portraits of Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Burials Among the many Swiss, Russians, Americans and British buried here, those of the English-speaking British and Americans are the majority as the Anglophone community in Florence in the nineteenth century was the largest. Many famous people are buried in the graveyard: Elizabeth Barrett Browning (in a tomb designed by Frederic, Lord Leighton), Walter Savage Landor, Arthur Hugh Clough, Francesca Trollope, Fanny Trollope and her daughter-in-law Theodosia Trollope and three other family members, Isa Blagden, Thomas Southwood Smith, Hiram Powers, Joel Tanner Hart, Theodore Parker, Mary Farhill, Fanny, the wife of William Holman Hunt in a tomb he himself sculpted, Mary, the daughter of John Roddam Spencer Stanhope in a tomb he himself sculpted, Sir david Dumbreck, Doctor Bartolomeo Odicini, Louise, sister to Henry Adams, whose dying he describes in his 'Chaos' chapter in The Education of Henry Adams, two children of the Greek painter George Mignaty, whom Robert had paint Casa Guidi as it was when Elizabeth Barrett Browning died there; Nadezhda De Santis, a black Nubian slave brought to Florence at fourteen from Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion's 1827 expedition to Egypt and Nubia, while the French Royalist exile F√©licie de Fauveau sculpted two tombs here. American historian, abolitionist and author Richard Hildreth, who died in Florence in 1865 after resigning his position as consul in Trieste, is also buried here near the grave of Transcendentalist minister and abolitionist Theodore Parker. These two tombs were toppled in the great storm of 19 September 2014 and are now restored. Giampietro Vieusseux, Swiss, the founder of the Gabinetto Vieusseux (where John Ruskin, Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky, Sarah Parker Remond, and Robert Browning were readers), is also buried here; and likewise the Swiss historian Jacques Augustin Galiffe, who with Jean Charles L√©onard Simonde de Sismondi pioneered genealogical, archival research, and his wife Emilie, daughter of Charles Pictet. Emily Dickinson treasured a photograph of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's tomb and wrote 'The soul selects her own society' about it, using lines also from Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Aurora Leigh; and Elizabeth Barrett Browning wrote a sonnet on Hiram Powers' sculpture The Greek Slave, which had been at the center of the Crystal Palace Exhibition, London, in 1851. Isa Blagden and Theodosia Garrett Trollope, part East Indian, part Jewish, were models for Miriam in Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Marble Faun, while George Mignaty's wife was the model for the head of Hiram Powers' Greek Slave. The cemetery is also the partial subject of Arnold Boecklin's Isle of the Dead, from its burial of his seven-month daughter, Maria Anna. In turn, the composer Sergei Rachmaninoff made use of Boecklin's painting for his Op. 29, The Isle of the Dead. Thus this cemetery forms a compendious memorial of western creativity, from America to Russia, from Scandinavia to Nubia, during Italy's 19th-century Risorgimento. James Lorimer Graham Jr., American consul in Florence when the city was capital. =Inscriptions= The tomb inscriptions are in Hebrew, Greek, Cyrillic, fraktura and Roman scripts, and in many languages - Hebrew, Russian, French, German, Danish, Romansh, English, and include passages of the Bible in vernacular translations (inscribed at a time when only a Latin translation was accessible to Roman Catholics). Closure and re-opening The Cemetery had to be closed in 1877, when the law forbade burials of bodies within city limits. The Scorpioni, a small group of elderly English ladies who lived in the city in the 1930s and 1940s, used to frequent the cemetery. Franco Zeffirelli based his semi-autobiographical film Tea with Mussolini on these expatriates. The Comune of Florence has now allowed the Swiss Church to reopen the cemetery for burials, but only of cremated remains, not bodies. The custodian of the cemetery is medieval scholar Julia Bolton Holloway, formerly a nun of the Anglican order Community of the Holy Family. Under her auspices, a library has been gathered, including books by and about those buried in the cemetery. Research is being carried out on the burial records in Britain, Russia and Italy, these being published in the virtual guidebook. An appeal seeks to continue restoring the cemetery after many years of neglect and abandonment. Its former beauty is recorded in Victorian era guidebooks and early sepia photographs, particularly those taken by Hiram Powers's son, Longworth Powers, now in the Gabinetto Vieusseux.

Ash Ra Tempel featured revolving members. G√∂ttsching retired the use of the Ash Ra Tempel name after he became the sole remaining member. His first solo album Inventions for Electric Guitar was the last album to bear the Ash Ra Tempel name. G√∂ttsching later used the name Ashra for his solo output as an homage to his former group. Ashra eventually evolved into a full band and continued along with G√∂ttsching until 1998. History The group was founded by guitarist Manuel G√∂ttsching, keyboardist/drummer Klaus Schulze, and bassist Hartmut Enke in 1971. All three founding members had previously played together as part of the short-lived group Eruption founded by Conrad Schnitzler. Prior to that Schnitzler and Schulze had worked together in Tangerine Dream. A short-lived project Manuel G√∂ttsching had in 1970 was the Steeple Chase Blues Band, which also included Hartmut Enke, Wolfgang M√ºller, and Volker Zibell. Ash Ra Tempel released its self-titled debut album in June 1971. This release is considered by critics to be a classic of the genre; Schulze temporarily departed for a solo career shortly after its release. Albums such as Schwingungen (1972), Seven Up (with Timothy Leary) (1972), and Join Inn (1973) are all considered key works from the band. The pop-oriented 1973 album Starring Rosi was thus named because it featured lead vocals by Rosi Mueller. A reunion concert performance with the original line-up took place in Cologne on February 28, 1973. After recording the soundtrack Le Berceau de Cristal (1975; unreleased until 1993) Ash Ra Tempel shortened its name to Ashra, making a more melodic, synthesizer-based music. In 2000 the band was reunited in the line-up of Manuel Gottsching and Klaus Schulze. The pair had previously worked together on Schulze's album In Blue. Musical style and influence Ash Ra Tempel exerted a relatively large influence on later space rock, krautrock, electronic and ambient music. The psychedelic bands Acid Mothers Temple and Hash Jar Tempo named themselves in reference to Ash Ra Tempel. The experimental rock ensemble Al Berkowitz covered Light: look at your sun, from Schwingungen, and featured it on their live album Apprenticeship and attitude (2009). Hungarian psychedelic hardcore, 'shaman punk' band Galloping Coroners also said that they were influenced by Ash Ra Tempel in the late 1970s.

This theology and Harivansh's leadership created the Radhavallabha sect. Radhavallabha Theology emphasizes devotion to Radharani. Shri Radhavallabh ji Temple in Vrindaban , Mathura is a very famous temple of the same preaching. This temple is among the most famous 7 temples of Thakur of Vrindavan including Sri Radhavallabh ji, Shri Govind Dev ji, Shri Bankey Bihari Ji and four others. In this temple, there is no deity of Radharani, but a crown has been placed next to Krishna to signify her presence. Description Shri Radhavallabh Temple is exactly located in Vrindavan District Mathura State Uttar Pradesh and Country India. It is situated near Bankey Bihari Temple. The \\"Tikaet Adhyaksh\\" of Shri Radhavallabh ji Temple is Shri Radheshlal Goswami and further his child Shri Mohit Maral Goswami, his son Shobhit lal Goswami and his brother Govind lal Goswami are also taking care of the temple. Shri Radhavallabh ji Temple was founded by Shri Hith Harivansh Mahaprabhu who is worshipped in the adjacent temple of Shri Radhavallabh ji which was earlier Shri Radhavallabh ji's temple but because of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb attack on Vrindavan he was shifted to other place and then the new temple was built. The Yugal Darshan of Radhavallabh ji is considered as difficult because of rituals due to which the \\"patt\\" gets closed. This temple with Madan teer and Seva kunj with Maharasmandal are held by the Tikaet Adhyaksh and are considered as Shri Radhavallabh ji's property. In this temple Radhaashtami is celebrated largely which is a festival on the birthday of Shri Radha Rani .

It is also a popular name of Krishna, meaning the consort of Radha. Shri Radhavallabhlalji is considered as Krishna as well as Radha in one. The appearance of Lord-Krishna, the reincarnation of the almighty with complete \\"sixteen-kala\\" avtar with his Divine-love consorts Sri Radha more than five thousands year age in \\"Brij- India\\"; is a well accepted fact of life by the people of India and not a mere legend of Historians. In the lap of nature, in Vrindavan with its cluster of forests and meadows surrounded by the revered river Yamuna, the almighty mingled with the people of the land, making on destination of cast and creed. The purest form of divine love play with Sri Radha displayed by him, opened up the most secluded, rarest and the super most path of \\"Ras-Bhakti\\", hitherto unknown to the world. Shri Radhavallabhlal temple is one of the icons of Vrindavan with extraordinary beauty, building style and wonderful darshans of deity. The Lord is considered as living with unearthly powers.

This was the first WWF program to feature such an \\"interactive\\" element. The show was used to summarize the weekly events in WWF programming and featured interviews with WWF personalities and allowed the fans to phone-in and ask questions to in-studio guests. One of the more notable calls occurred during a brief cross- promotional angle involving Extreme Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation. On the October 5, 1996 episode of LiveWire, Paul Heyman, using the alias \\"Bruce from Connecticut,\\" called in to LiveWire to express his discontent with boring WWF programming and the state of the promotion. Faarooq also debuted the concept of the Nation of Domination on LiveWire. LiveWire later became exclusively a weekly summary show in similar style to that of WWF Mania. The show was hosted by Todd Pettengill and Sunny. Michael Cole later took over as host until July 2000 when he was succeeded by Jonathan Coachman.

Many of the characters are based on characters, enemies, and classes from the original Final Fantasy as well as Dungeons and Dragons, but are highly satirized and parodied, most of them being comically foolish and inept. The Light Warriors The Light Warriors, riding blue Chocobos. From left to right: Red Mage, Thief, Black Mage and Fighter. Collectively known as the Warriors of Light (or simply \\"the Light Warriors\\"), Black Mage, Fighter, Thief and Red Mage are the main characters of 8-Bit Theater. Their names and appearances are based on four classes from the first Final Fantasy game. Despite composing the \\"classic\\" heroic party, they are, for the most part, incompetent, dysfunctional, have few redeeming traits and tend to do more harm than good. As the author, Brian Clevinger, stated \\"I'm not sure why the Light Warriors worry about obstacles or monsters standing in their way. They are nothing compared to the obstacles and monsters within the party.\\" =Black Mage= First appearance: Episode 001: We're going where? Sprite: Black Mage (Final Fantasy, NES); Class Change: Magus (Final Fantasy III, Famicom) Black Mage is an evil wizard and a nexus of magical power in human form. He delights in being evil to the point where even his conscience is split not between his good and evil side, but between his evil and his atrociously evil side, and has a \\"kill list\\" that includes only two entries: \\"Everyone I know\\" and \\"Everyone I don't know\\". Black Mage is frequently shown to be overweight and carry poor social and hygiene habits. Being physically weak, Black Mage usually relies on an array of destructive magic spells, most prominently a beam of destructive energy he calls the Hadoken, which he wants to use often but can only cast once a day. He gained the spell by sacrificing nine orphan children to his dark gods, and reveals to Red Mage that it is powered by siphoning off love from the universe, literally turning other people's happiness into focused destruction; he's not sure of the exact amount, but is given to understand that the divorce rate goes up with each use. Black Mage keeps his face hidden; according to him, it is so \\"contrary to Euclidean geometry\\" that no one can look at it without going mad, demonstrated by driving a young boy (Later revealed to be Sarda) insane. =Fighter= First Appearance: Episode 001: We're going where? Sprite: Warrior (Final Fantasy I, NES); Class Change: Knight (Final Fantasy III, Famicom) Fighter is a warrior specializing in swords and master of a style called Zodiac Kenshido, capable of wielding more than two swords at once and, after his class change, blocking anything with his swords. Fighter is extremely resilient towards physical damage in general and easily recovers even from lethal injuries (most often demonstrated with Black Mage's tendency to repeatedly stab him when he gets fed up with his idiocy). Fighter is the inventor of sword-chucks, a weapon that combines swords and nunchaku by linking two swords with a chain that is often referred to as more dangerous to the wielder than to enemies. Skilled as he is, he is also extremely na√Øve, childlike and has an almost single-minded sword fixation. Fighter firmly believes the Light Warriors to be archetypes of heroes that do good deeds wherever they go and remains oblivious towards their often cowardly and villainous actions. His innocence endears him to many characters that dislike the other Light Warriors, such as White Mage and Sarda, and despite his ordinarily ignorant disposition he occasionally shows surprising bursts of intelligence. Fighter is later revealed by his patron deity, Dr. Swordopolis, to be the Enlightened Warrior destined to save the world from destruction, except said event comes to pass without him. =Thief= First Appearance: Episode 004: Fight heroes, fight! Sprite: Thief (Final Fantasy I, NES); Class Change: Ninja (Final Fantasy III, Famicom), modified Thief is a sneaky, greedy and cunning Elf and the Prince of Elfland. His main assets are his skills at thievery and his wits; Thief claims to be able to steal anything that isn't both nailed down and on fire, including intangible objects such as souls, secrets, and things that aren't there. In addition, he manipulates people with legal contracts and, in fact, became the Light Warriors' contractual leader by talking Fighter into signing such a contract. Before his class change, Thief rarely engaged in physical combat, preferring to hide and let the others do the work. After becoming a Ninja he gained the ability to throw any object, including his teammates (and somehow himself) and tends to use kicks and punches in combat. Thief originally tried to conceal his Elven heritage from the Light Warriors, but was forced to reveal his true identity when an Elven court threatened the group with execution. It was subsequently revealed that Thief originally left his kingdom in secret in order to raise money for a cure for his dying father, though having no actual moral qualms about stealing he continued stealing even after his father was cured. Thief, like all Elves, is incredibly arrogant and considers all non-Elven races, particularly Dwarves, to be below him. He regards the other Light Warriors as little more than his lackeys (and at times fair game). =Red Mage= First Appearance: Episode 034: Introductions Are In Order Sprite: Red Mage (Final Fantasy I, NES); Class Change: Red Wizard (Final Fantasy III, Famicom), modified Red Mage claims to be the last surviving member of an ancient order of Red Mages and as such is the most knowledgeable and versatile, yet also the most delusional, of the Light Warriors. He firmly believes the world runs according to the rules of tabletop role-playing games (such as Dungeons & Dragons) and actively tries to use knowledge of these rules to his own advantage. While this enables him to fight as well as use both White and Black Magic, he often bends the rules to absurd degrees and has, for example survived normally lethal injuries by \\"forgetting\\" to write down the damage he suffered. After his class change Red Mage gained the ability to mimic his teammates' actions. Red Mage is the main \\"strategist\\" of the group. His plans, however, are usually overly complicated and bizarre. While in accordance with logic on a certain level, his plans frequently include obvious flaws, such as a plan to construct a \\"cold fission\\" reactor entirely from ice. Most of the time Red Mage's plans fail horribly as the laws of physics get in the way, but his stratagems have proven surprisingly successful a number of times, most notably in the Light Warriors' battles against the first three Fiends. Either way, Red Mage tends to be overconfident about his plans and believes them to be foolproof. Other main characters =White Mage= First Appearance: Episode 024: \\"She's a White Magic Woman.\\" Sprite: White Mage (Final Fantasy III, Famicom) White Mage is a priestess who specializes in healing magic and who is on a mission to restore order to the world \\"after a great evil has swept across its surface.\\" She was originally a candidate to be one of the Light Warriors, but was rejected by the group in favor of Red Mage. Afterwards she still followed them on their journey for most of the comic's history. There is ongoing tension with Black Mage's lustful attraction to her, usually resulting in White Mage hitting him with her hammer, although she regularly heals his wounds out of sheer devotion to her position. White Mage often questions her purpose in the world and fate itself for choosing a group of people to be Light Warriors who spread destruction wherever they go. She often blames herself for the results of the Light Warriors' actions. However, in the end she manages to fulfill her mission and destroy Chaos himself. As a result of a time travel accident, White Mage is also the creator of the universe. =Black Belt= First Appearance: Episode 074: Guest Appearances By... Sprite: Monk/Black Belt (Final Fantasy I, NES) Black Belt is an extremely skilled martial artist with an all but non-existent sense of orientation and the ability of defying the laws of physics simply by misunderstanding them, which rendered him capable of Munchausenesque feats such as walking across a pit on a rope that, unknown to him, had been untied at both ends. Early in the comic, Black Belt shows up as White Mage's loyal bodyguard, but he is later killed in the Light Warriors' battle with Kary, the Fiend of Fire. Black Belt's teachers (who resemble Ken and Ryu from the Street Fighter video game series) identify the fighting style they and Black Belt use as Wu Xia. Black Belt himself described the prevailing theory of his school as the credo that an opponent who is too broken to move is an opponent who is defeated. =Sarda the Sage / Chaos= First Appearance: Episode 041: It Just Got Weird in Survivor 8-bit Style Part 6 (as a child) / Episode 300: The House Always Wins (as Sarda) / Episode 1180: The Next Stage (as Chaos) Sprite: Doga (Final Fantasy III, Famicom), modified (adult) / Onion Kid (Final Fantasy III, Famicom) (child) / Fomortiis (Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones) (Chaos) Sarda, the self-proclaimed Wizard Who Did It (in reference to the common cop out \\"a wizard did it\\" as an explanation for inconsistency and plot errors), is an evidently omnipotent wizard who is able to effortlessly manipulate reality itself and will readily do so out of sheer boredom. For example, the world of 8-Bit Theater used to have 36-hour days, but Sarda reduced them to 24 simply to make everyone hurry up. He never stops to think about the consequences of his actions, citing that he wouldn't be the Wizard Who Did It if he did. Sarda plays a much more vital role in the comic than in Final Fantasy, where a character named Sarda only serves to let the player explore one dungeon. In the comic Sarda drives the Light Warriors to recover the four Orbs, often by force and at no time concerned with the Light Warriors' chances of survival. He repeatedly sends them on suicidal missions providing them with wholly inadequate supplies, most prominently the ever-same shaky vessel of transportation, the \\"deathtrap.\\" For obvious reasons, the Light Warriors harbor a strong dislike for Sarda, but choose not to argue with him for fear he will \\"unmake [them] before [they] were born\\". Towards the end of the comic, Sarda is revealed to be a time traveller who plans to kill the Light Warriors, whose actions during the entire story led directly to his first exposure to black magic as a young child and the death of his biological family as well as several foster families. However, after absorbing the magical energy of the four elemental orbs as well as Black Mage's concentrated evil energy, he loses control and his body is possessed by Chaos, the evil Demon King that the Light Warriors are questing to defeat the entire comic. Chaos himself is eventually defeated in a deliberate anticlimax by four White Mages, a twist that was described by Brian Clevinger as \\"probably the longest ranged call back attempted by a webcomic.\\" Major enemies =The Dark Warriors= The Dark Warriors, from left to right: Drizz'l, Garland, Bikke, and Vilbert The Dark Warriors are major enemies the Light Warriors have defeated separately in the past who teamed up to take revenge. With the exception of Drizz'l, they are based on antagonists from the game; Drizz'l is the son of Astos, who is based on a game character. Garland First Appearance: Episode 052: Meanwhile... Sprite: Dark Knight (Final Fantasy III, Famicom, modified from Episode 053 on) Garland is the first major enemy faced by the Light Warriors and a former military leader of Corneria. Despite his best attempts to become an evil villain, he is a nice and caring person who enjoys cooking and treats the Light Warriors more like guests rather than prisoners during their imprisonment in his castle. After his first failed encounter with the Light Warriors, he forms the Dark Warriors and begins a propaganda campaign against the Light Warriors. Bikke the Pirate First Appearance: Episode 208: Look Who's Back Sprite: Thief (Final Fantasy I, NES), modified Bikke is an incompetent and dim-witted pirate captain and the second member of the Dark Warriors. He is known for his intense body odor and his tendency to speak in a clich√©d pirate accent. Bikke managed to let his entire crew almost die from scurvy after feeding them nothing but Cheetos, which led directly to his defeat. Although he is a pirate captain, he cannot swim and, despite having two perfectly normal, functional hands, desires to be called \\"The Claw\\". He is completely illiterate and unable to comprehend simple arithmetic. Prince Drizz'l of the Dark Elves First Appearance: Episode 268: Out on a Web Sprite: Gordon (Final Fantasy II, Famicom), modified Drizz'l, a Dark Elf and the son of King Astos, is the third member of the Dark Warriors. His name, a parody of the name of Drizzt Do'Urden, roughly translates from Elven into \\"The Relentless Scourge.\\" Drizz'l is a sword master equal to Fighter and controlled a pack of giant spiders before he was defeated by the Light Warriors in Marsh Cave. Drizz'l considers himself the most intelligent of the Dark Warriors, although his inherent Elven arrogance often gets the better of him. Vilbert von Vampire First Appearance: Episode 366: Evil Has a Name Sprite: Scholar (Final Fantasy III, Famicom), modified Vilbert, the son of Lich, is a vampire and a clich√©d goth live action role-player who, prior to meeting the Light Warriors, lived in his parents' basement. =The Cultists= First Appearance: Episode 523: The Doom That Came to Ice Cave Sprite: Black Wizard (Final Fantasy, NES; modified) The Cultists are a doom cult whose true name \\"cannot be said or written without driving you mad.\\" and who the Light Warriors have encountered and defeated twice. They dwell in extremely remote areas and worship ancient beings that are reminiscent of the ones found in H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. The Cultists induce new members by beheading them and implanting the larva of an \\"Old One\\" in the body, where it matures, giving the Cultists the appearance of a humanoid being with long tentacles in the lower half of their faces; their look and method of reproduction makes the Cultists resemble illithids or Mind Flayers, fictional monsters from the roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons. The Cultists take pleasure in disturbing paraphilia (especially those that carry taboos). All of the Cultists have names that are pronounced similarly to female names, such as L'zlhe (Leslie), Lv'rn (Laverne), or Suh'zahne (Suzanne). Among the ancient entities the cultists worship is Ur, the Fiend of Water. After the Light Warriors defeated them, they accidentally used the cultists' ancient \\"end of the world formula\\" and summoned Ur by invoking his true name, Jnn'efur (Jennifer). =The 4 Fiends= The Fiends are evil elemental beings, far stronger than regular monsters. They guard the orbs the four elements are tied to. After their defeats, all the Fiends entered Hell one by one and gathered there until they were eventually summoned back, only to be killed shortly afterwards. In the Final Fantasy video game, the Fiends served as major bosses. They consisted of Lich (Earth), Kary/Marilith (Fire), Kraken (Water) and Tiamat (Air/Wind), and each of them also had to be defeated twice, once during the normal course of the game and once in the game's final area. Lich, Fiend of Earth First Appearance: Episode 380: Introducing... Sprite: Black Wizard (Final Fantasy, NES; modified) Lich is an undead, immortal wizard and self-proclaimed \\"Master Bonecraftsman\\" who believes all things live to die and that the dead exist to serve him. He confronts the Light Warriors after they defeated his son Vilbert and kills Black Mage. During the battle, the Light Warriors discover Lich has stored his soul in the Earth Orb, rendering him immortal. He is eventually defeated when Thief \\"steals\\" his soul out of the Earth Orb and Black Mage, who emerges as the new ruler of Hell, banishes Lich to the underworld, where he promptly ousts Black Mage from his position and takes his place as the ruler of Hell. Lich's departing words were \\"Death is but a door, time is but a window; I'll be back\\", a direct quote from Ghostbusters II. Kary, Fiend of Fire First Appearance: Episode 466: Trigger Happy Kary appears as a woman with six arms and the lower body of a snake. She guards the Orb of Fire and is extremely hot-headed, demonstrated by her killing all her minions with little, if any, provocation. During her battle with the Light Warriors, she kills Black Belt, but is defeated when the Light Warriors manage to stuff her into a bag of holding and cast Ice-9, an enormously powerful Ice spell that causes all thermodynamic activity in the universe to cease (and a reference to the Kurt Vonnegut novel Cat's Cradle) into the bag. Ur, Fiend of Water First Appearance: Episode 753: Day of the Tentacle (vessel), Episode 764: Red October (actual) Ur, the Fiend of Water, is an ancient entity worshiped by the Cultists that Fighter accidentally summons by invoking his true name, Jnn'efur. Initially it appears as a large chaotic mass of sticky tentacles that engulfs Red Mage just before he can reveal the Fiend's weakness. However, Ur is defeated rather anticlimactically when, just before he can bring about the apocalypse, Red Mage cuts his way out of him with a sword. Ur represents the fiend Kraken from the game. While it is only ever called Ur in the comic, Red Mage does note that Ur is \\"your basic Krakenoid\\". Brian Clevinger notes that either name is valid. Muffin, Fiend of Air First Appearance: Episode 907: Animal Companion Sprite: Idoun, the Demon Dragon (Fire Emblem: F≈´in no Tsurugi, GBA) Muffin, the owner of both the flying Sky Castle and the Orb of Air, is a dragon who Dragoon considers his \\"pet parrot\\", having never seen a parrot or a dragon before, and believing her lie about her species. Muffin had established the order of Dragon Knights ten thousand years ago in order to kill the other dragons, allowing her to take their powers, treasure, and knowledge. Afterward, she slaughtered the dragoons so they would not learn of her plot. When the Light Warriors attack Muffin's Sky Castle, Dragoon kills her with a spear through the head. Muffin is the comic's version of Tiamat, the Fiend of Wind from Final Fantasy. She is never directly referred to as Tiamat, but Dragoon indicates that Muffin may not be her real name. =King Astos of the Dark Elves= First Appearance: Episode 245: Wheels Within Wheels Sprite: Thief (Final Fantasy, NES), modified Astos, originally a boss in the first Final Fantasy game, is the father of Drizz'l. He planned to drive Elfland into a civil war by overthrowing the currently ruling Elven clan, using the alias \\"Chancellor Usurper of Clan Sahn'ta\\" to get close to the king and Prince Elf (Thief). He had the king poisoned and put into a coma to this end. In a stroke of luck, Thief and the Light Warriors overheard Astos dictating his plot to himself. The next day, the Light Warriors confronted Astos. They never got around to an epic battle, however, as Astos was killed by a bad pun from Black Mage. He turned out to carry both Matoya's Crystal Eye and the formula for an antidote for King Elf. =The Ordeals= First Appearance: Episode 608: Teleporting never screws anyone Sprite: Kraken (Final Fantasy III, NES; Greed), Dracocotta (Final Fantasy III, NES; Sloth), Black Mage (Final Fantasy, NES; Atrocity), Spirit Naga/Grey Naga (Final Fantasy, NES; Pride), Lunasaur/Lunasaurus (Final Fantasy IV, SNES; Zombie Dragon) In the Castle of Ordeals, each of the Light Warriors had to deal with a manifestation of the worst flaw in their personality, three of them being one of the seven deadly sins. While Fighter had to contend his Sloth, Red Mage his Pride, and Thief his Greed (although being teleported forced Black Mage to face it instead), Black Mage encountered a doppelg√§nger, as the only thing that could represent his evil was himself. The final Ordeal was a giant Zombie Dragon, to which Red Mage comments that \\"a giant Zombie Dragon has little relation to facing one's own inner struggles\\". As in Final Fantasy, defeating it earned the Light Warriors a Rat's Tail, which they exchanged for a class change. Other characters =Princess Sara= First Appearance: Episode 052: Meanwhile... Sprites: Aria (modified) and Princess Sarah (both Final Fantasy III, Famicom) The daughter of King Steve and Queen Jane and the heir to the Cornerian throne, Princess Sara, had already been kidnapped about six times by the time Garland got to her. Her rescue is the first mission that King Steve gives to the Light Warriors. Although she appears to be a respectable princess, Sara hides a calculating and bloodthirsty nature and uses her time as Garland's \\"prisoner\\" to coach him into becoming a proper villain. After her \\"rescue\\", she resumes life in Corneria, later turns down an offer to join the Dark Warriors, declaring them hopeless, usurps the rulership of the Kingdom from her clueless father and runs the kingdom without his knowledge. =King Steve= First Appearance: Episode 058: Government At Work Sprite: Prince Alus (Final Fantasy III, NES; modified) King Steve is the father of Princess Sara and the completely innefectual and delusional ruler of Corneria. He recruits the Light Warriors to rescue his daughter, Sara, from Garland. Steve initially sends hundreds of \\"light warriors\\" on his errand, surmising that the chosen ones, being destined to save the world, would prevail and those who were not the chosen ones would die off; he was oblivious to the many deaths this would cause, and once informed was still dismissive of this fact. Steve is a capricious and entirely delusional despot with only a tenuous grip on reality who, among other things, has devastated his country in an attempt to drill for mana (a reference to FFVII's mining for lifestream), believes to have invented inventing, believed he was running for election against a length of string (ignoring the fact that Corneria is a monarchy), made a coffee stain (\\"Rodney\\") his right-hand man, and wears shoes made from baby skin. Following the conclusion of the Sara kidnapping arc, Steve has not been involved in the main story, but he continues to make frequent appearances in the comic, his adventures often serving as a sideline to the main story. =Dr. Swordopolis= First Appearance: Episode 083: A Shout Out to All You Web-Heads Out There Sprites: Dymlos (Tales of Destiny, PlayStation), modified Dr. Swordopolis is the very incarnation of all things sword. He appears to Fighter in visions, taking the form of a bespectacled sword and bringing cryptic and often-ignored advice. His secret agenda throughout the comic is to bring Fighter to kill Black Mage in order to prevent the latter becoming a portal for Chaos to enter the world, a plan the naive Fighter never quite catches on to. =Matoya= First Appearance: Episode 172: The Inhabitant of the Cave Sprite: White Magic Seller (Final Fantasy, NES; recolored) Matoya is a blind witch who sends the Light Warriors on a side-quest to regain her magic eye after feeding them poisoned nightmare-inducing cookies, promising them an antidote if they return with it. Due to her poor hearing, she also grants Fighter the Armoire of Invincibility, instead of the Armor of Invincibility Fighter was actually searching for (although Fighter did not seem to notice or care). She is almost as greedy as Thief and once almost tricked Thief into paying her the entire kingdom of Elfland in return for his father's cure. Matoya has an overtly sexual relationship with Bahamut, the Dragon God-King, much to the disgust and horror of the Light Warriors. =The Other Warriors= The Other Warriors are a band of adventurers based on Dungeons & Dragons character classes who travel the world. They occasionally met the Light Warriors on their journey, were involved with obtaining the Orb of Air and were eventually killed by Sarda. Generic Half-Elven Dual-Class Ranger First Appearance: Episode 435: He's a Fighter, Not a Diplomat Sprite: Bard (Final Fantasy III, Famicom) Ranger is very poetic and adventurous, as well as extremely friendly and trusting, though a bit na√Øve. He is capable of firing multiple arrows at once with uncanny accuracy and is able to use four bows at once, being a dual-class ranger/ranger. Ranger's heritage combines elven, human and orcish blood. Berserker Axinhed First Appearance: Episode 437: Companion Sprite: Viking (Final Fantasy III, Famicom), modified Berserker is a dwarf with two distinct personalities, one civilized and gentle and the other a raging, furious warrior. His calm side is characterized by polite and eloquent conversation and wearing a monocle; when entering a rage, the monocle falls off and he begins swearing and shouting incoherently while mauling whoever happens to stand nearby. He seems unaware of his split personality and unable to remember his actions in the respective other state. Cleric First Appearance: Episode 446: \\"Stand Up Next to a Mountain...\\" (mentioned), Episode 577: So Many Warriors (actual) Sprite: Summoner (Final Fantasy III, Famicom), modified A \\"miracle shopper\\" who makes deals with the gods. In order to keep an open market, Cleric prefers not to devote himself to one single deity and is, in fact, an atheist. His use of divine intervention is often faulty and unreliable. Cleric made a deal with a Trickster God named Raven to bring Thief back to life; in return, Raven bestowed him with a \\"healing shiv\\", which has shown its worth in bringing Thief back from the very brink of death. Rogue First Appearance: Episode 446: \\"Stand Up Next to a Mountain...\\" (mentioned), Episode 578: One More Look Into The Mind Of Fighter (actual) Sprite: Thief (Final Fantasy III, Famicom) Like Thief, Rogue is constantly scamming people, including his own teammates. However, unlike Thief, who conducts his business through contracts and legal loopholes, Rogue relies on a network of shady contacts, one of whom is Thief himself. His catch phrase is \\"I may know a guy...\\" =Bahamut= First Appearance: Episode 569: What Dragon? Sprite: Bahamut (Final Fantasy III, Famicom), modified Bahamut is the God-King of Dragons who was awakened by Black Mage, although Fighter was blamed for doing so. He offered to give the Light Warriors \\"the power of self-realization and the power that comes with it\\" in exchange for the tail of the dreaded Dire Rat. When the Light Warriors brought him such a tail from the Castle of Ordeals, he granted their Class Changes. It later turned out that the reason Bahamut desired a rat tail was that rat tail soup is a potent virility drug, to be concocted by his girlfriend, Matoya. According to Muffin, Bahamut will slumber until the prophecy of the Enlightened Warrior (later revealed to be Fighter) is fulfilled in order to usher in the end of the world. Red Mage thus suspects that in attempting to save the world, they may have accidentally endangered it. =The Dark God= First Appearance: Episode 654: Ominous Sprite: Magus (Chrono Trigger, SNES) The only one of the Dark Gods Black Mage worships to appear to him, the Dark God made his class change effective. The Dark God's name, if any, has not been revealed, so Black Mage himself makes up the name \\"Darko, the Dark God of the Dark\\" in an attempt to convince his friends that he had really met a dark god. His official title is \\"Executive Assistant to Chaos\\", being one of many middle management deities in the organization of evil, and his plan was to guide Black Mage to overload himself with magic energy to the point where he'd become a portal for Chaos to enter the world. Thanks to Black Mage's incompetence, the plan failed. =Dragoon= First Appearance: Episode 787: Course change Sprite: Dragoon (Final Fantasy III, Famicom), modified Dragoon is the last of the Dragon Knights, an elite group of spear-carrying warriors who attack by jumping high in the air and coming down on their opponents. Dragoon uses this technique as a travel method, but is unable to perform these jumps without having a target. His usual target is Black Mage, although he does not harbour any ill will against the Light Warriors. In fact, he is extremely polite towards them, remaining oblivious to the considerable pain his travel method causes. Dragoon has encountered the team several times, mostly in passing. Like the Light Warriors, he was looking for the Air Orb that the Other Warriors seemingly stole from him and which he means to use to rebuild the Order of Dragon Knights. He had since been seen with White Mage and Sarda's younger self, before being teleported to the Moon by Sarda. Sometime in the following years, he joined Red Mage's support group for lone survivors of secret societies (Sects Buddies) after returning from the moon. Dragoon had a pet dragon named Muffin (who was actually the Fiend of Air) whom, like all dragons, he believed to be a parrot. =Warmech= First Appearance: Episode 986: 1/64 Sprite: Warmech/Death Machine (Final Fantasy, NES) Warmech is a robot and was the Sky Castle's guardian until it was blown up. He wants revenge on the Light Warriors for ridding him of his job, but his own incompetence prevents him from doing so. In his insanity, he follows the Light Warriors in a very transparent disguise as a human, but is outwitted again. In Final Fantasy, the Warmech/Death Machine was the strongest regular enemy and a precursor of later games' superbosses. The title of the episode in which he first appears refers to the chance of encountering one in a certain area of the Sky Castle/Flying Fortress dungeon.

It aired on the USA Network from January 1, 1985 to January 4, 1993. A precursor to Monday Night Raw, Prime Time Wrestling was a two-hour long, weekly program that featured stars of the World Wrestling Federation. The program featured wrestling matches (most of which were compiled from WWF \\"house show\\" matches from venues such as Madison Square Garden), interviews, promos featuring WWF wrestlers, updates of current feuds and announcements of upcoming local and pay-per-view events. In addition, Prime Time Wrestling would also air wrestling matches and interviews from other WWF programming such as Superstars of Wrestling and Wrestling Challenge. Episodes 61 to 227 of Prime Time Wrestling are available for streaming on the WWE Network. Main focus Despite the format changes in its last years, the main focus of Prime Time Wrestling remained unchanged-- recapping the highlights of the WWF's flagship syndicated programs and presenting exclusive matches taped from the house show circuit. Many of these were main event caliber and mid-card matches seldom seen on the syndicated programs, which tended to show primarily squash matches. Many wrestlers‚Äô first WWF television appearances were also on this show. Selected matches from the past and present from WWF's flagship arenas of the time ‚Äî Madison Square Garden in New York City, Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, the Spectrum in Philadelphia, the Capital Centre in the Washington suburb of Landover, Maryland, and the Boston Garden in Boston ‚Äî that had aired on various regional sports networks were also aired on Prime Time Wrestling. History =Early years= Premiering on January 1, 1985, the original hosts of Prime Time Wrestling were Jesse Ventura and Jack Reynolds. Reynolds would co-host his final edition of Prime Time on July 9, 1985, with Gorilla Monsoon replacing him as Ventura's co-host the week after. Bobby Heenan made his first appearance as Monsoon's co-host on April 28, 1986, and officially replaced Ventura on June 30 of that same year. =The Monsoon/Heenan era= The best- remembered Prime Time format featured Heenan and Monsoon introducing taped matches and analyzing them afterward, with Monsoon taking a babyface and sometimes neutral position and Heenan unashamedly cheering on the heels, especially members of The Heenan Family. The chemistry between Monsoon and Heenan made this show popular with fans for many years, despite the fact it was not considered one of the WWF's \\"primary\\" shows for most of its history. Many other wrestling programs--both produced by the WWF and by other companies --would attempt to copy this formula, with varying degrees of success. Although primarily a studio-based program, Prime Time would occasionally go on the road and tape its segments from various outside locations. Examples included Busch Gardens, Trump Plaza, the CN Tower, and Churchill Downs, among others. These segments rarely had much to do with the actual wrestling content of the program, and were played primarily for the comic interaction between Monsoon and Heenan. Heenan and Monsoon co-hosted Prime Time from 1986‚Äì1991. Roddy Piper replaced Heenan briefly in the summer of 1989, during the period Heenan \\"took over\\" the last half-hour of the Prime Time program for his own talk show; after Heenan returned to the main program, Piper was retained for the remainder of 1989 as a second co-host. Piper's final episode was the Christmas 1989 episode, where he attacked Heenan for dressing like Santa and badmouthing the Christmas season and insulting kids. The Rosetti Sisters, a group of overweight sisters who were fans of the WWF, were frequent co-hosts from 1989‚Äì90, also serving as assistants to Heenan on his show. At times, guests have appeared on the studio set for cameo appearances or to sub-host for someone. Gene Okerlund was the most frequent guest, sometimes stopping by on the set for no reason other than to antagonize Heenan. Okerlund also was a substitute host for the series whenever Monsoon or Heenan were away; Vince McMahon was also a substitute host when Monsoon fell ill in early 1988. Tony Schiavone also guest hosted an episode of the series along with Sean Mooney, with the explanation being that Monsoon and Heenan were at the Trump Plaza for Wrestlemania V. Also notably, Freddie Blassie made an appearance in late 1989, antagonizing Heenan for owing him money and turning face in the process. For the rest of the episode, he remained as a special guest co-host alongside Piper in Piper's studio. The Red Rooster and The Brooklyn Brawler also appeared as guests in 1989 for the purpose of an angle where Lombardi knocked out Monsoon with a chair and beat up The Rooster, who had just fired Heenan as his manager. Rick Rude also guested in the summer of 1989 mostly to further his feud with Piper. Arnold Skaaland, Hillbilly Jim, Salvatore Bellomo, Ted DiBiase, Koko B. Ware, Mr. Fuji, Demolition, Lord Alfred HayesFigure Four Weekly #528: Lord Alfred Hayes Passes Away - August 8, 2005 and Harley Race also stopped in the studio as guests during the run of the series. =Format changes= February 18, 1991‚ÄìNovember 4, 1991 On February 18, 1991, Prime Time changed formats to something vaguely resembling a talk/variety show, with an in-studio audience. Vince McMahon and Bobby Heenan hosted this version of Prime Time, with Lord Alfred Hayes serving as an announcer. WWF wrestlers were frequent guests during this particular incarnation of Prime Time, which was similar to the WWF's old Tuesday Night Titans program. McMahon's last appearance as a co-host was the June 10, 1991 episode. In the weeks that followed, Gene Okerlund, Sean Mooney, and Gorilla Monsoon all filled in for McMahon as co-hosts. On the July 15, 1991 episode, Mooney became the official co-host of Prime Time alongside Heenan. The duo would remain the show's co-hosts until this format was discontinued after the November 4, 1991 episode. November 11, 1991‚ÄìJanuary 4, 1993 Prime Time's final format debuted on November 11, 1991, and featured a panel of WWF personalities (including, at various points, Bobby Heenan, Gorilla Monsoon, Jim Duggan, Randy Savage, Mr. Perfect, Jerry Lawler, Slick, Sgt. Slaughter, and Hillbilly Jim) participating in a roundtable discussion about the goings-on in the WWF. Vince McMahon served as host and moderator for the panel.

The band consists of vocalist Benjamin Windsor, drummer Andrew Atkins, bassist Matthew Gore and guitarist Mark Edward Warner. Band history After the Fall singer Ben Windsor performing at the Hard Rock Cafe in Surfers Paradise, 2005. Forming in 2000 on the Central Coast of New South Wales, After the Fall drew influences from Australian icons like Midnight Oil and AC/DC. Their debut extended play (EP) As Far As Thoughts Can Reach was released in 2003, with the song \\"Three Quarter Binding\\" receiving airplay on Triple J. They established a following through tours with the likes of AFI, Dashboard Confessional and 28 Days. Their debut studio album, After the Fall, was recorded in 2003, mainly in the band's own rehearsal space. It was produced by Richard Stolz, who had worked with the likes of Bodyjar and 28 Days. The single \\"Mirror Mirror\\" was high up in the Triple J Net 50 for a period of time following good airplay. Their second album, Always Forever Now, was recorded in March 2005 with Stolz again. Vocalist Ben Windsor said the band were not fully prepared when commencing studio work for the album; \\"We entered the studio without a complete scope of where the record was going. I had lyrics to finish and we really weren‚Äôt a 100% on what tracks we were going to lay down... We need to be pushed, and that‚Äôs what happened.\\" The album peaked at number 23 on the ARIA Charts, boosted by the single \\"Concrete Boots\\". After the Fall have released four videos from their two albums: \\"Mirror Mirror\\" from their 2004 effort, After the Fall, and \\"Concrete Boots\\", \\"The Fighter\\", and \\"Outta Mind\\" from Always Forever Now. \\"The Fighter\\" appeared in several Australian television advertisements, including one for popular primetime show Smallville. After the Fall have played at festivals such as Homebake, Rockit, The Falls, Splendour in the Grass, Livid, and Come Together Music Festival. In March 2005, the band traveled to the USA to play at the SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas. They toured, as a supporting act, around Australia with British band The Darkness in April 2006. In mid-2006 guitarist Christopher Butcherine left the band. Butcherine appeared on both the band's self-titled album, second album Always Forever Now and debut EP As Far As Thoughts Can Reach . From 25 October to 5 November 2006, After the Fall performed on the Coca-Cola Live 'N Local Tour encompassing all major Australian cities. They played alongside other Australasian acts Evermore, The Veronicas, End of Fashion and The Hot Lies. They performed on Triple J's Like a Version in March 2007, performing a cover of Billy Joel's \\"Only the Good Die Young\\" as well as a new song \\"All It Takes\\", rumoured to be featured on their next album. The band also performed live on Channel Ten's show Rove. In 2008, After the Fall's track \\"Cut Your Losses\\" was put in rotation on Triple J radio. The song is on a compilation album called Turning the Tide. After previously releasing their albums through major record labels, the band decided to release independently. They recorded a third studio album in 2008, selecting a few locations including a country house in Victoria to record it. \\"Break Me\\" was released as a free download from the band's website and was not sold in traditional formats. The album was entitled [In] Exile and released through Roadrunner Records on 28 August 2009. It was produced by Richard Stolz.

Picoult has published 26 novels, accompanying short stories, and has also written several issues of Wonder Woman. Approximately 40 million copies of her books are in print worldwide, translated into 34 languages. She was awarded the New England Bookseller Award for fiction in 2003. Picoult writes popular fiction which can be characterised as family saga. She frequently centres storylines around a moral dilemma or a procedural drama which pits family members against one another. Although she is often characterised as an author of chick-lit, over her career, Picoult has covered a wide range of controversial or moral issues, including abortion, assisted suicide, race relations, eugenics, LGBT rights, and school shootings. She has been described as, \\"a paradox, a hugely popular, at times controversial writer, ignored by academia, who questions notions of what constitutes literature simply by doing what she does best.\\"Geoff Hamilton and Brian Jones (2010), Encyclopedia of Contemporary Writers and Their Works, Infobase Publishing Early life Picoult was born in Nesconset, New York, on Long Island and has one younger brother. She graduated from Smithtown High School East in June, 1983. She has described her family as \\"non-practicing Jewish\\". Picoult wrote her first story at age five, titled \\"The Lobster Which Misunderstood\\". Picoult's mother and grandmother were both teachers, and she says that their influence on her was very important.  Education  She studied creative writing at Princeton University with Mary Morris, and graduated in 1987 with an A.B. in English after completing a 320-page-long senior thesis titled \\"Developments.\\" She published two short stories in Seventeen magazine while still in college. Immediately after graduation, she began a variety of jobs, ranging from editing textbooks to teaching eighth- grade English. She earned a master's degree in education from Harvard University. Picoult has two honorary Doctor of Letters degrees; one from Dartmouth College in 2010, the other from the University of New Haven in 2012. In 2016, Picoult was selected to be Princeton's Class Day Speaker before commencement. Career Picoult became the writer of the DC Comics series Wonder Woman (vol. 3), following the departure of Allan Heinberg. Her first issue (number 6) was released on March 28, 2007, and her last was issue number 10, released on June 27, 2007. Nineteen Minutes, Picoult's novel about the aftermath of a school shooting in a small town, published on the 9th March 2007, was her first book to debut at number 1 on the New York Times best- seller list. Her book Change of Heart, published on March 4, 2008, was her second novel to debut at number 1 on that list. Handle with Care in 2009 and House Rules in 2010 also reached number 1 on the Times best-seller list. Jodi Picoult is aware that she is often pigeon-holed as chick-lit author, but stated that what she loses in critical acclaim, she gains in influence: \\"I‚Äôm never going to win the Nobel prize for literature, not going to win a National Book award, never even going to be nominated. What you trade for that is sales and readership. And I would rather reach more people. It would be very nice to not be unfairly accused of being a bad writer, but hopefully if you do pick up one of my books, you will be quickly disabused of that notion.\\" In November 2019, Picoult participated in the criticism of Brooke Nelson, a college student who was mentioned in her local newspaper as saying she thought that author Sarah Dessen's YA novels were not suitable for the Common Read program run by Northern State University, Aberdeen, and had instead advocated for the inclusion of Just Mercy, a memoir by civil rights attorney Bryan Stevenson. Picoult described Nelson's views as \\"sinister\\" and \\"demeaning to women\\", and encouraged her followers on twitter to \\"fight the patriarchy\\" in response to Nelson's comments. When the story was reported in Jezebel, The Guardian, the Washington Post, and Slate, Picoult posted an apology on Twitter, noting that her remarks had resulted in harassment and bullying of Nelson.  Advocacy  In 2016, Picoult joined the advisory board of Vida: Women in Literary Arts, a \\"non-profit feminist organization committed to creating transparency around the lack of gender parity in the literary landscape and to amplifying historically-marginalized voices, including people of color; writers with disabilities; and queer, trans and gender nonconforming individuals\\". Picoult's website says that VIDA: Women in Literary Arts is a research-driven organization. She was a member of the inaugural Writers Council of the National Writing Project in 2013, an organization which recognizes the \\"universality of writing as a communicative tool and helps teachers enhance student writing\\". This inaugural group consisted of 30 published authors. She was a spokesperson for Positive Tracks, which empowers young people to fundraise through the power of athletics and partners with other charitable organizations. In 2010, Picoult led the 5th Annual Children's Hospital at Dartmouth Hero Half Marathon & Relay 5K Walk around Occum Pond and through the town of Hanover, New Hampshire. She is a member of the Advisory Committee for the New Hampshire Coalition Against the Death Penalty, an organization seeking to end the death penalty in the state of New Hampshire through outreach, education and advocacy. She was the co-founder, with Marjorie Rose, of the Trumbull Hall Troupe in 2004 as a means of providing children with a fun, educational theatre experience. Children from grade 6 through grade 12 audition to be in an original musical written by Picoult and the composer Ellen Wilber. The proceeds are donated to local charities. The organization's contributions since its founding have exceeded $120,000. On January 21, 2017, Picoult spoke at the New Hampshire Women's Day of Action and Unity in support of the Women's March on Washington.

The typical secret handshake involves placing one's fingers or thumbs in a particular position, one that will be recognized by fellow members while seeming to be a normal handshake to non-members. This is most frequently associated in the popular consciousness with college fraternities, fraternal orders and secret societies. A secret handshake can also be a useful form of familiar interaction between friends, colleagues, and family members. As a form of cryptography, secret handshakes are shared only with select and elect peoples. Usually a secret handshake has underlying meanings that differ from person to person. Secret handshakes involve a precise, sometimes complex series of movements and contact between two individuals or even a group. Usually, these movements involve the primary use of hands, but could also involve a series of touching feet, elbows, or in some cultures a friendly kiss.  Historical usage  Judas Iscariot betrays Jesus with a kiss Secret handshakes cannot be traced back to a specific dated origin, but it can be determined that it is as old as any form of greeting or identification. In the Roman mystery religion Mithraism, members were initiated with a handshake, and members were known as syndexioi (united by the handshake).M. Clauss, The Roman cult of Mithras, p. 42: \\"That the hand-shaken might make their vows joyfully forever\\" The Freemason Society is one of the most well-known and longstanding implementations of secret handshakes. However, Biblical records also show evidence of secret greetings or handshakes. Although not a technical handshake, the account in the Gospel of John of the kiss of Judas, by which Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus, can be viewed as a form of secret greeting. The Freemasons have at least 12 known universal secret handshakes that were implemented in their society. However, there are believed to be many more unrecorded masonic secret handshakes. The secretiveness of this society is prevalent in their greetings. Fellow masons shake hands using secret handshakes, but within the society, apprentices and masters have distinctly different handshakes to identify one from another. Additionally, the Freemasons make use of the aforementioned secret signals to subtly indicate who is of what level. For instance, one handshake used between a master from an apprentice includes distinct touches on the knuckles.  Modern usage  Handshakes are very common even today. The usage of secret handshakes in modern society is much more informal compared to the historical usage of secret handshakes. Where historically, a secret handshake would have a more formal, serious tone, today, secret handshakes are shared by mostly people in grade school who share a friendship type relational bond with one another. Secret handshakes are not commonly used to gain access to secret meetings today, but are more commonly used in an informal setting. Most likely one will see young school-aged children exchanging a complex, whimsical secret handshake on the playground during break time. The most common modern term used to identify modern is the word ‚Äòdap‚Äô or dap greeting. This term is used to collectively identify most secret handshakes used today, and usually includes a fist bump somewhere in the sequence of contacts.

It tells the story of thirteen-year-old Anna Fitzgerald, who sues her parents for medical emancipation when she discovers she is supposed to donate a kidney to her elder sister Kate, who is gradually dying from acute leukemia. Summary The story takes place in the fictional town of Upper Darby, Rhode Island in 2004. Anna Fitzgerald's older sister, Kate, suffers from acute promyelocytic leukemia, a blood and bone marrow cancer. Anna was born as a savior sister specifically so she could save Kate's life through the donation of her umbilical cord blood. At first it is successful, but the cancer continues to relapse throughout Kate's life. Anna is usually willing to donate whatever Kate needs, but when she turns 13, she is told that she will have to donate one of her kidneys due to Kate's kidney failure. The surgery required for both Kate and Anna would be major; it is not guaranteed to work, as the stress of the operation may kill Kate anyway, and the loss of a kidney could have a serious impact on Anna's life, since Anna is fond of hockey. Anna petitions for medical emancipation with the help of lawyer Campbell Alexander, so she will be able to make her own decisions regarding her medical treatment and the donation of her kidney. At first Sara, their mother, believes that Anna's decision is led by a simple need of attention, but Anna is serious and refuses to withdraw her complaint, so the case has to be discussed in front of a judge. Having been a civil attorney before becoming a mother, Sara decides to represent herself. The judge assigned to the case is Judge De Salvo, who the year before lost his twelve-year-old daughter because of a drunk driver. Recognizing that it is impossible for Anna and Sara to be together during the trial, Judge De Salvo hires Julia Romano, the court-appointed guardian ad litem whose job it is to decide what would be best for Anna. Julia was once romantically involved with Campbell when they went to high school together, but Campbell broke her heart when he left her. Unbeknownst to Julia, Campbell left her because, after an accident that resulted in a concussion, he developed epilepsy and thought she deserved better. Meanwhile, Anna's older brother, Jesse, who has spent most of his life being ignored in favor of ill Kate or donor Anna, spends most of his time setting fire to abandoned buildings with homemade explosives and using illegal drugs. He is a self- confessed juvenile delinquent, which leads to their father Brian eventually confronting Jesse for his behavior. During the trial, it is revealed that Anna is acting under her sister's wishes: Kate is tired of living; she's ready to die and doesn't want to force Anna to donate a kidney that will likely not be enough to save her life, so she encouraged Anna to gain the independence that has always been denied to her. As Anna stands up to testify, Campbell Alexander has an epileptic seizure and, thanks to this, Julia discovers the reason of their breakup, leading her to swear to Campbell that he doesn't need to hide his illness from her, and they can be together. The judge rules in Anna's favor, and grants Campbell a medical power of attorney. After gaining medical emancipation, Anna hints that she plans to donate her kidney to Kate, wanting her sister to live. However, as Campbell drives her home after the trial, their car is t-boned by a truck. The on-call firefighter, who happens to be Brian, Anna's father, who arrives at the scene, retrieves an unconscious and severely injured Anna from the wreckage of the crushed car. Anna goes into cardiac arrest and is revived, but when she and Campbell are rushed to the hospital, the doctor informs Sara and Brian that Anna is brain-dead and asks them if they have considered organ donation. An injured Campbell steps in and declares that he, as the one who has the power of attorney, allows the donation and Anna's kidney is successfully transplanted. Kate survives the surgery but Sara and Brian are devastated: after so many years lived hoping to not see their first daughter die, the death of Anna is something completely unexpected and utterly unfair, but there's nothing anyone can do so the life- support machines are shut off. After eight years, the Fitzgerald family is still struggling to cope: Jesse has reformed, graduated from the police academy, and has been awarded by the mayor for his work in uncovering drugs; Campbell Alexander and Julia Romano are married, but they don't often meet up with the Fitzgerald family, as the memory of Anna's death is too painful; both Sara and Brian needed years to accept their daughter's death, while Kate has recovered from her leukemia and has become a ballet teacher. She still feels deeply guilty, believing that Anna's death could have been avoided if she didn't push her to sue their parents, but feels relieved remembering that a part of Anna keeps living inside her through the kidney that, at the end, truly managed to save her life. Characters *Kate Fitzgerald - A frail teenage girl who was diagnosed with promyelocytic leukemia at a young age. She is the older sister of Anna, and the middle child out of all three Fitzgerald siblings. She sometimes finds all the attention on her stifling. One of the few times that Kate experiences being a typical teenaged girl is when she dates, and has her first kiss with a boy named Taylor. Kate supports the feelings of her younger sister, Anna, and is thankful for the bodily donations Anna has been made to give her throughout her lifetime. Near the end of the novel, Kate is revealed to be the one who asked Anna to sue for medical emancipation, because, fed up with the awareness of how much she took from her and the rest of their family, she wanted, for once, to be the sister who protected the other one. *Andromeda \\"Anna\\" Fitzgerald - A girl who was biologically engineered in order to be a \\"savior sibling\\" to her elder sister, Kate. At first Anna was only meant to donate her umbilical cord, but when this treatment didn't cure Kate's cancer, Anna repeatedly donates blood, marrow, and eventually, an organ to her. She is thirteen years old at the time the novel takes place, and seeks to be medically emancipated from her parents. Anna seeks this legal designation to have control over her own body so she won't have to donate anything else to Kate, namely a kidney, against her will. She is the main protagonist of the novel. *Jesse Fitzgerald - The oldest Fitzgerald child, who is dyslexic. Throughout most of the novel, he is a delinquent teenager, but, in young adulthood, after coming to terms with his inner emotions, he goes on to become a police officer, and is no longer rebellious, or desperate for attention, as he was in his teen years. *Sara Fitzgerald - The overprotective and domineering \\"helicopter parent\\" of Kate, Anna, and Jesse. She tries her hardest to keep her oldest, ill, daughter alive and well. Sara refuses to accept the idea that Kate is likely to die, but doing so she ends up neglecting the needs of her two other children, whom she keeps seeing in relation to Kate. Before the novel's end, Sara finally listens to Anna about Kate and comes to terms with her choice to die, expressing remorse for her behavior. *Brian Fitzgerald - Sara's husband, who understands Anna's decision to not donate her kidney, but also feels compassion for his wife. He is fond of astronomy and becomes torn between his daughter(s), and his wife, during Anna's emancipation trial. Ultimately, Brian sides with his wife during his testimony in court, regardless of his conflicting feelings. He also shows concern for his son, and is the one to confront him about his troubling behavior. After Anna's death, he too needs a lot of time to cope with it. *Julia Romano - The court-appointed, guardian ad litem, whose job it is to decide what is best for Anna. She also often advises Anna regarding medical emancipation. She and Anna's lawyer, Campbell Alexander, dated in young adulthood, before he broke her heart. *Campbell Alexander - The lawyer who defends Anna as she tries to become medically emancipated from her parents. He believes that she should have control over her own body, and eventually obtains medical power of attorney over her, when the case is successful. He personally uses a service dog, which others find \\"mysterious\\", because he does not tell anyone why. It is later uncovered that Campbell suffers from epilepsy, and that this diagnosis is the reason he broke up with Julia, as he did not believe she \\"deserved\\" an unwell mate, that she'd have to look after. *Suzanne - Jesse, Kate and Anna's wealthy aunt, Brian's sister-in- law and Sara's older sister of 10 years. Their relationship is strained due to her overzealousness in keeping Kate alive. While coming to Sara's aid occasionally due to her wealth, she is more supportive of Anna in suing for medical emancipation. *Dr. Harrison Chance - Kate's oncologist. *Judge DeSalvo - The presiding judge over Anna's medical emancipation case. *Isobel \\"Izzy\\" Romano - Julia's twin sister and roommate. She is a jewelry designer and she is fresh from a relationship with another woman named Janet. She is very close to her sister, as such despises Campbell for having left Julia. *Taylor Ambrose - Kate's boyfriend. He is diagnosed with myeloid leukemia and meets her at the hospital while undergoing chemotherapy. Kate has some of her happiest times with him, as he's one of the only people with whom she's been able to fully relate, and to speak her deepest, true, feelings about being sick, with. They went to a prom but, sadly, he died a few days later. To prevent Kate from losing her will to live, her mother didn't inform her of Taylor's death until she went into remission, one month later. Development history =Publication history= Picoult, Jodi. My Sister's Keeper. Atria Books: New York, 2004; /. Critical reception In review for The Washington Post, Katherine Arie described some of the characters as unconvincing, such as Brian, who is \\"too good to be true\\", Jesse, \\"a poster child for self- destructive behavior\\", and Kate, who is \\"as weak and wispy on the page as she's supposed to be in life\\", but ultimately called the book \\"a thrill to read\\". In 2009 the American Library Association (ALA) and the office for Intellectual Freedom named My Sister's Keeper the seventh out of ten most frequently challenged books in the US. Schools and libraries attempted to ban the book for the following reasons: Sexism, Homosexuality, Sexual Explicitly, Offensive Language, Religious Viewpoint, Unsuitability to Age Group, Drugs, Suicide, Violence. Adaptations New Line Cinema adapted My Sister's Keeper into a feature film, which was directed by Nick Cassavetes and released on June 26, 2009. It starred Cameron Diaz as Sara and Alec Baldwin as Campbell. Kate and Anna were played respectively by Sofia Vassilieva and Abigail Breslin. The film features an alternate ending and more emphasis on certain subplots while entirely eliminating others. This was against the wishes of Picoult. =Differences between novel and film= * The novel's setting is in Rhode Island, while the film's setting is in California. * Julia Romano, a central character in the novel and Anna's guardian ad litem during the trial, does not appear in the film. * Aunt Suzanne is also a central character in the novel and while she has come to the family's aid due to her wealth, her relationship with Sara is strained due to her being overzealous in saving Kate's life. In the film, she is replaced with Aunt Kelly who follows a similar role to Suzanne. * Campbell and Anna's relationship is more detailed in the novel than in the film. * Jesse is a juvenile delinquent in the novel. However, his relationship with his parents improves when Brian finds out why he has been acting out and turning to a life of crime. In the film, Jesse is more neglected by his parents. He is stopped from going into a life of crime by Aunt Kelly, who talks to him. * In the novel Sara is a brunette with dark eyes and cares for the well being of all of her children. In the film, she is blonde and more obsessed with saving Kate, neglecting Brian, Anna and Jesse's needs. The film at times portrays her as a villain. * Kate is a blonde in the novel and is 16, while in the film, she's a brunette and 15. * Jesse is a brunette in the novel and is 18, while in the film, he's 18 and blonde. * Anna is 13 and plays hockey in the novel, while in the film, she is 11 and plays soccer. * Judge DeSalvo is male in the novel, but female in the film. * While in the novel the reason of the trial is especially Anna's need to be free and independent, the movie is more focused on Sara's refusal to accept that Kate is dying. * In the novel, Anna dies in a car accident with her usable organs being donated to Kate and, who remains in remission for 8 years. In the film, Kate dies from her leukemia and Anna lives. * In the novel's epilogue, Kate explains how her family has been trying to cope with Anna's death and their lives since the trial. In the film, Anna mentions their family goes to Montana every year to honor Kate and that Sara is proud of her for standing up for her own rights. * In the novel, it was Judge's barking that got Campbell to ask Anna about her reasons in suing for medical emancipation and it leads to her confession. In the film, it was Jesse who exposed Kate's role in the lawsuit. His exposure angered not only Anna because she was trying to protect their sister, but also Sara for interrupting them. * In the novel and before the verdict, Anna tells Sara about Kate's plans to die. While shocked at first, she comes to terms with it and wished Kate had told her sooner. She even mentions that she understood why Anna tried to protect her sister. In the film, Sara is in denial and accuses Jesse of lying to her. When Brian comes to his defense by pointing out her own wrongdoing in not listening to their family as they knew Kate wanted death, Sara feels guilty for ignoring her family and finally accepts responsibility for her actions. * In the novel, Campbell had a seizure during the trial, and Brian stepped in to help him. In the film, Campbell left midway of the argument between Sara, Jesse and Brian and had a seizure from not being able to take his medication on time.

It was syndicated weekly and aired from 1986 to 1995. The show became simply known as WWF Challenge in 1995. The show featured matches, pre-match interviews, and occasionally, summarized weekly events in WWF programming. Matches primarily saw top-tier and mid-level talent versus jobbers. At times, there was a \\"feature\\" match between main WWF talent. As with other syndicated WWF programming, the show promoted WWF event dates and house shows in local media markets. It was the 'B' show of WWF syndication, meaning it generally only aired in markets where WWF had two weekly slots, with the other taken up by WWF Superstars of Wrestling. History Wrestling Challenge premiered on September 7, 1986, replacing All-Star Wrestling. Following the show's debut, The Snake Pit, hosted by Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts, debuted as a feature of the show. The Snake Pit was an in-ring interview segment modeled after Roddy Piper's Piper's Pit, which aired on WWF Superstars of Wrestling. Wrestling Challenge also featured the similarly formatted The Brother Love Show. This segment, which debuted in 1988, was later moved to Superstars of Wrestling. After this, the main feature was a podium interview featuring Gene Okerlund and a random WWF superstar until 1991. Starting in 1991, The Barber Shop debuted with host Brutus \\"The Barber\\" Beefcake, while The King's Court, hosted by Jerry Lawler debuted in 1993. =Title changes= While WWF Superstars of Wrestling held most title changes on national television, Wrestling Challenge only had one title change on November 1, 1992 (taped October 13, 1992), as Money Inc. defeated The Natural Disasters to win the WWF World Tag Team Championship, with interference from The Headshrinkers. =Commentators= The hosts for the first three episodes were Gorilla Monsoon, Ernie Ladd, and Luscious Johnny V. After that, Ladd was replaced by Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan while Johnny V continued to do commentary solely for matches where Heenan was managing, until Valiant would leave the WWF in late 1987. The show began to be hosted by Dok Hendrix and occasionally Mr. Perfect until the show was cancelled in 1995. Other hosts included: *Gorilla Monsoon and Lord Alfred Hayes, UK Challenge (1987-1988) *Vince McMahon and Bobby Heenan (February 7, 1988) *Gorilla Monsoon, Tony Schiavone, and Bobby Heenan (June 25, 1989) *Gorilla Monsoon and Tony Schiavone (July 2, 1989 - April 1, 1990) *Vince McMahon and Gorilla Monsoon (November 19, 26, December 3, 1989) *Gorilla Monsoon, Bobby Heenan, and Jim \\"The Anvil\\" Neidhart (March 31, 1991 - August 25, 1991) *Gorilla Monsoon and Bobby Heenan (September 28, 1986 - June 18, 1989, April 22, 1990 - March 24, 1991, September 1, 1991 - April 4, 1993) *Jim Ross and Bobby Heenan (April 11, 1993 - December 5, 1993) *Jim Ross and Gorilla Monsoon (December 12, 1993 - February 13, 1994) *Gorilla Monsoon and Stan Lane (February 13, 1994 - March 20, 1994) *Stan Lane and Ted DiBiase (March 27, 1994 - August 7, 1994, February 26, 1995) *Jim Ross and Ted DiBiase (August 14, 1994 - August 28, 1994) *Gorilla Monsoon and Ted DiBiase (July 10, 1994, September 4, 1994 - April 23, 1995) *Jim Ross and Gorilla Monsoon (April 30, 1995 - July 30, 1995) *Stan Lane and Gorilla Monsoon (June 18, 1995) *Jim Ross and Dok Hendrix (August 6, 1995 - August 27, 1995) International transmission In some parts of Canada, Wrestling Challenge was repackaged as WWF Cavalcade, with the only difference apart from the title being Canadian- produced interview segments. This repackaging allowed the program to count as Canadian content. In the United Kingdom, the show aired on Sky 1 and a repackaged version was aired occasionally from 1987 until 1988 on ITV as a part of the final two years of ITV's Saturday lunchtime Wrestling coverage. Certain ITV areas also screened a batch of 10 months' worth of episodes (covering the period August 1987-June 1988) in an early morning graveyard timeslot, erroneously announced in TV listings as Superstars Of Wrestling. The late night ITV slot would be replaced in 1990 by tapes of WCW. The Sky transmission continued to air in the UK until 1997, when it was repackaged as WWF Shotgun Challenge.

He was later appointed as king or governor of the city-state of Dublin by his father.https://www.academia.edu/29536360/Muirchertach_Ua_Briain_politics_and_naval_activity_in_the_Irish_Sea_1075_to_1119 Candon, Anthony \\"Muircherteach Ua Briain, politics and naval activity in the Irish sea, 1075-1119.\\" pages 1‚Äì5  Governor of Dublin  Background: Importance of Dublin Despite the victory of Muircherteach's great-grandfather Brian Boru over the Vikings at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014 and the breaking of Norse power in Ireland, Dublin remained under the rule of Norse-Gael kings and had links with other Viking Kingdoms. They paid tribute to their Irish overlords, but otherwise the Irish rarely interfered, mainly because of the trade the Norse brought to the area. However in the year 1052, the King of Dublin, Echmarchach mac Ragnaill, was removed by the King of Laigin (Leinster), Diarmuit mac Ma√≠l ma mB√≥. Echmarchach was replaced by Diarmuit's son, Murchad. As a prince of Leinster, Murchad acted as a sort of governor of the city on the behalf of his father, the King. Diarmuit seemed to appreciat the importance of Dublin which, even back then, was recognised as a sort of national capital city and was important for a number of reasons, especially trade and its military forces, particularly its naval fleet. Appointment of Muirchertach Following the death of the King of Leinster in the year 1075, Dublin came under the control of Muirchertach's father, Toirdelbach mac Donchad Ua Briain, King of Munster and High King of Ireland, as he expanded his power throughout Ireland. Toirdelbach at first appointed Godfraid mac Ragnaill as king but he was later expelled by Toirdelbhach. He then placed a man by the name of Domnall as governor but he was himself replaced by Muirchertach later that same year after the former's sudden and unexpected death. This was probably Muirchertach's first major political appointment as it was in this year that he was first mentioned in the Annals of Tigernach, signifying the power and the importance of the position he held. As governor, he would have had frequent contact with the Archbishop of Dublin, Patrick. Patrick had previously held positions within the Catholic Church in England in various different areas and would have been very familiar with the politics of England following the invasion by the Norman's in 1066. Patrick was the one who possibly influenced Muirchertach's great interest in affairs outside Ireland later in his career. On the 19th of October 1084, Muirchertach led a large army consisting of the armies of the Kingdoms of Dublin, Leinster, Osraige and Munster against the forces of Donchad ua Ruairc of Breifne, in a battle at Moin Croinnioce, near modern Leixlip in County Kildare. Over 4,000 men were killed in the battle, with Muirchertach heavily defeating the forces of Ua Ruairc. After the battle, Muirchertach cut off Ua Ruairc's head and brought it to his father's palace in Kincora. King of Munster In 1086, following the death of his father Toirdelbach, Muirchertach claimed the Kingship of Munster. Initially, Toirdelbach had divided the Kingdom between his three sons Muircherteach, Diarmuit and Tadc. However Tadc died the following year and Muircherteach banished Diarmuit, claiming the entire province for himself. Diarmuit, however, was evidently not going to let Muircherteach take the Kingship so easily and made an alliance with the King of Leinster. The forces of Diarmuit and Leinster met with the forces of Muircherteach at Raith Etair, possibly the promontory fort on Howth Head in northern County Dublin. The forces of Muirchertach were victorious, and Muircherteach's claim to the Kingship was no longer under any threat. In 1088, Muirchertach led a number of naval campaigns against Ruadhr√≠ na Saide Buide Ua Conchobhair, King of Connacht. The first fleet sailed up the River Shannon as far as Clonfert, but the crews were slaughtered by the Connachtmen. Another fleet was sent around western coast of Ireland on the Atlantic Ocean, but this fleet was also defeated by the forces of Connacht. Ruadhr√≠ then attacked Munster when he invaded northern County Clare, near the homeland of the D√°l gC√°is. However, a new rival emerged in the form of Domnall Mac Lochlainn, King of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill, who later in 1088 invaded Connacht and successfully gained the submission of Ruadhr√≠ na Saide. The Ruadhr√≠ and Domnall formed an alliance and together they attacked Munster. At the time, Muirchertach was away campaigning in Leinster. They burned and looted Limerick, Killaloe and Emly, and took over 160 hostages. Muirchertach was forced to buy back these hostages with gold, silver, cattle, and meat. According to a source from Munster, Muirchertach avenged himself by attacking the Kingdoms of Meath and Leinster, the latter presumably having fallen into enemy hands since the time Muirchertach had been governor of Dublin. He gained the submission of both provinces, killing the King of Leinster in the process. He also fought around Dublin, burning a building in Lusk, Fingal killing over 160 people inside. He then headed west and cut down the sacred inaugural tree of the Kings of Connacht. Muirchertach was involved in further naval actions against Connacht the next year in 1089 when he was looting islands in Lough Ree, but Ruadhr√≠ na Saide blocked the path home on the River Shannon around the settlement of Clonmacnaoise, forcing Muircherteach to hand over his ships to the forces of the Kingdom of Meath after retreating to Athlone. He marched with his army back home to Munster on foot, but using Muirchertach's confiscated ships, the Meathmen and Connachtmen sailed southward on the Shannon and plundered the plains around Cashel. Four kings now battled for supremacy in Ireland: Muircherteach Ua Briain of the Kingdom of Munster, Domnall Ua Ma√©l Sechnaill of the Kingdom of Mide, Ruadhr√≠ na Saide Buide Ua Conchobhair of the Kingdom of Connacht, and Domnall Mac Lochlainn of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill. The four kings met in 1090, where Mac Lochlainn was acknowledged as High King of Ireland and he received hostages from the other three kings. Following this conference, Muirchertach went on campaign in Leinster again, but while he was away, Munster was attacked by Ua Ma√©l Sechnaill who was joined by Ruadhr√≠ na Saide. Although he was defeated by the Meath forces, he was able to drive the armies of Connacht back, and then received assistance from Mac Lochlainn in the north in defeating Ua Ma√©l Sechnaill. Ruadhr√≠ na Saide again invaded Munster two years later in 1091, but he was blinded the following year in 1092 by Flaithbertaigh Ua Flaithbertaigh, throwing the Kingdom of Connacht into a state of political turmoil. Muirchertach took advantage of this situation by invading the province and gaining the kingship, in the process possibly taking in and grooming his nephew Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobhair for the day he would be come king of Connacht. These events left Muirchertach in the south and Mac Lochlainn in the north the most powerful kings in Ireland. He continued expanding his power with further campaigns in Mide, more or less gaining the overlordship of the region, and he reconciled with his brother Diarmuit at Cashel in 1093.Annals of the Four Masters, UCC Corpus of Electronic Texts (CELT) version, Part 22, accessed 21 April 2008 King of Ireland In 1094, Muirchertach fought the kings of Leth Cuinn and Gofraid Crob√°n, King of Dublin and the Isles. He went with his army to Dublin and banished Gofraid, and brought about the killing of Domnall Ua Ma√≠l Shechnaill. He asserted supremacy over the Southern U√≠ N√©ill of the Kingdom of Meath, dividing the province among two rival clans, utilizing the policy of divide and rule, which had been used very effectively by his father before him. The Irish Sea and Magnus Barelegs Since the Kingdom of Dublin had fallen to the Irish of Leinster in the year 1052, Irish influence in the Irish Sea, particularly the Kingdom of Man and the Isles, had greatly increased. Diarmuit mac Ma√≠l na mB√≥, King of Leinster and High King of Ireland, was also King of the Isles through capturing Dublin as Dublin was part of this Kingdom. Having ousted the Norse- Gael King, he was in a very powerful position. After Diarmuit's death, Muirchertach's father Toirdelbach, became High King of Ireland and had control of Dublin. He was involved in the Isles of Man as well, more or less controlling the island, possibly through one his sons, Tadc, brother of Muirchertach, marrying a woman from the Manx Royalty. Upon Toirdelbhach's death and the accession of Muirchertach to the throne, the Manx may have used the opportunity to assert some form of independence from Irish rule, lasting until 1095, when Muirchertach was able to assert control, again through a political marriage into Manx Royalty, who had requested a king from the Irish royal bloodline. This time, the alliance was made through his nephew Diarmuit, Tadc's son, who married a Manx princess. By gaining overlordship of the Isles, Muirchertach was able to access the manpower and large naval fleets of the Isles, and he had a base from which to launch assaults on Ulster in the Hebrides, which would prove useful in his war against Domnall Ua Lochlainn. However, this attracted the attention of the King of Norway, Magnus III, better known as Magnus Barelegs, who wanted to retain Norwegian power in the area and bring the Norse Kingdoms such as the Orkney, the Isles and Dublin. In a fleet of around sixty ships and several thousand men, he re-established Norse power in the area, garrisoning the islands of Orkney and Man. Although some sources say he did want to conquer Ireland, there was not much contact between the Norwegians and the Irish, apart from an incident when three Norwegian ships were sunk by the Ulaid (who were under Muirchertach's overlordship), probably while cattle raiding in the area. Some sources do say Magnus planned a full assault on Ireland, but the Irish gathered large army on the coast, and Magnus did not attack. Earlier, Muirchertach had sent a fleet to Wales to help the Welsh fight the Normans who were encroaching on their territory on the Island of Anglesey. However, the Normans were able to buy off the Irish ships to their side, and the Welsh were defeated. The English victory celebrations were interrupted by Magnus, however, who landed and routed the Norman army, reputedly shooting Hugh de Montgomery, brother of Arnulf, through the eye. Later, when the Irish fleet returned home, they were punished by Muircherteach for their treachery. After this event, Anglesey was considered the southerly most point of the Kingdom of Norway. After these campaigns, Magnus returned home to Norway to campaign against Sweden, but he would return later. In 1101, Muirchertach declared himself High King and travelled the island provinces. He is first named as High King in the Annals of Tigernach in this year. It was in this year that he gave the fortress on the rock of Cashel as a gift to the Church. It was probably around this time that he commissioned the piece of propaganda, Cogad Ga√©dal re Galliab, \\"the War of the Irish with the Foreigners\\". The work was intended to romanticize the accounts from the annals, in a bid by Muirchertach to secure the O'Brien Dynasty's claim to the High Kingship, in a time when the throne was fiercely contested by the Northern U√≠ N√©ill in Ulster and later, the Ua Conchobhairs of Connacht. An Sligeadh Timcheall In 1101, officially High King of Ireland and with the church on his side, Muirchertach planned his largest and most ambitious campaign yet, called An Sligeadh Timcheall (\\"The Circular Hosting\\"). He gathered the armies of the various kingdoms, save those of Ulster, and marched northwards. The six week long campaign began with his army marching north to the River Erne at Assaroe, then to the Inis Eoin Penisula, burning Ardstraw and Fahan on the way. The offensive culminated with the destruction of Grianan an Aileach, an important fort of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill, in revenge for Ua Lochlainn's earlier burning of towns in Munster. Muirchertach famously ordered his men to bring back one stone from the walls of the fort for every sack of provisions they had. They marched home to Munster along the ancient route of Slige Midluachra. For the first time during his reign, he had successfully subdued the Ulaid. The Northern U√≠ N√©ill had been severely weakened, but did not capitulate. Muirchertach would lead several campaigns against Ua Lochlainn over the next few years, but was unable to gain their submission, with the campaign almost always ending in stalemate in southern County Armagh. With the Ulaid now under his control, however, he had another angle from which to attack the U√≠ N√©ill from in the Northeast, and easier access to the Hebrides and other areas of the Isles, and parts of Scotland.  Campaigns in the North and Second War in the Irish Sea  Like many of the High Kings of Ireland from the South had found, including Muirchertach's great-grandfather Brian Boru, the last place to recognise their authority was Ulster, namely the Kingdoms of Ulaid and the Northern U√≠ N√©ill. At the turn of the century, Muirchertach led annual campaigns against the Domhnall Ua Lochlainn and the other northern kings, with mixed success. Muirchertach's armies consisted of soldiers from every Irish Kingdom apart from Ulster. The fighting was often heavily concentrated in what is now modern southern County Armagh, but Muirchertach would often be halted by the intervention of the comrade Patraic, the abbot of Armagh, who would organise truces between the two kings. Muirchertach attempted a campaign against the Cen√©l Chonaill, with naval support from the fleet of Dublin, but he was forced to retreat following the destruction of the Dublin fleet. Around the same time, Muirchertach was also under threat from Magnus Barefoot of Norway, who had returned with a larger force than his first Irish Sea campaign, possibly with the intention of invading Ireland. Magnus had earlier raided Inis Cathaigh (Scattery Island) at the Shannon estuary in 1101, possibly testing the situation and defenses of Ireland. Muirchertach enlisted the support of Magnus, who provided military support for the High King in his war against the men of Ulster. They forged an alliance, cemented by the marriage of Muirchertach's daughter, Bjaƒëmunjo, to Magnus's son, Sigurd. The treaty also saved Ireland from Norse raids, but the Irish lost most of their control in the Isles to the Norwegians. Muirchertach also recognised Norwegian control over Dublin and Fingal, with the western lands of the Kingdom of Norway under the control of Sigurd, who was announced as co-king alongside Magnus on the day of his wedding. The Muirchertach and Magnus campaigned together in Ulster throughout late 1102 and early the next year. Contrary to the Norse sagas, the Irish Annals describe the campaigns as largely unsuccessful. Norse sources say Magnus spent the winter in the High King's palace at Kincora in Killaloe with Muirchertach, but it is also possible that he wintered in Dublin. In the summer of 1103, Muirchertach launched an offensive against Domnall Ua Lochlainn, but was defeated on the 5th of August at the Battle of Mag Coba. After this, with enemies to the north and Magnus threatening his throne, it is possible Muirchertach wanted Magnus out of the way. There is confusion surrounding the death of Magnus. Norwegian sources say Muirchertach was supposed to bring Magnus provisions for his return to Norway. When Muirchertach did not show up at the agreed time, Magnus became suspicious the Irish were going to attack. On the 24th of August 1103, St. Bartholomew's Day, or the day before according to one source, Magnus gathered his army and landed on the coast of north eastern Ireland. It is possible he made an incautious cattle raid, and the Ulaid mistook the Norwegians for cattle raiding Hibrideans. Alternatively, it is possible that Muirchertach ordered the Ulaid to bring Magnus supplies, but the Ulaid took this is an order to ambush him. It is also possible that powerful men in Norway wanted Magnus removed from the throne, and bribed a contingent of his forces to desert back to their ships during the battle. As Magnus landed on the shore, a large Irish force emerged from the thick bush. In the ensuing battle, Magnus was killed, and the Norwegian force was destroyed. Afterwards, Sigurd returned home to Norway without his bride. Norwegian influence remained in the area, but no Norwegian king would set foot in the region for another 150 years after the death of Magnus, which was during the Scottish-Norwegian War of 1266. The de Belleme family and England Following the death of William II of England in the year 1100, the throne was seized by Henry I of England. However, the crown as also claimed by William's older brother, Robert, the Duke of Normandy. Some of Robert's supporters included the de Belleme family, \\"one of the most powerful non-royal families in Europe.\\" Robert de Belleme was Duke of Shrewsbury, and his brother Arnulf was Earl of Pembroke. Robert of Normandy invaded the Kingdom of England to secure the throne, but he and Henry quickly came to an agreement before there was any major bloodshed. But Henry turned against Robert's supporters, namely the two de Belleme brothers. Robert de Belleme sought assistance from the Welsh and from Magnus Barefoot, but received none from the latter (matters were complicated as Magnus had killed Robert's brother, Hugh, which Magnus apparently later regretted). Arnulf meanwhile sought assistance from Muirchertach. Arnulf sent his steward, Gerald of Windsor, to negotiate with the High King. As part of their agreement, Arnulf was to marry Muirchertach's daughter. The High King agreed, and he dispatched his daughter with a fleet to assist the de Bellemes. However, Robert and Arnulf were defeated by Henry before the fleet could arrive to assist them. According to a Welsh chronicle (Sean Duffy, p. 45, 1997), Arnulf \\"thought to make peace with the Irish and to obtain help from them. And he sent messengers to Ireland, that is Gerald the Steward (Gerald of Windsor) and many others, to ask for the daughter of King Murtart for his wife. And that he easily obtained; and the messengers came joyfully to their land. And Murtart sent his daughter and many armed ships along with her to his aid. And when the earls had exalted themselves with pride because of those events, they refused to accept any peace from the king.\\" De Montgomery and his brother Robert were defeated by Henry, however, and fled to Ireland. The Montgomery brothers fought under Muirchertach during his campaign with Magnus Barelegs, but when de Montgomery attempted to seize the kingship for himself, Muirchertach \\"took his daughter away from Arnulf and gave the wanton girl in an unlawful marriage to one of his cousins. He resolved to kill Arnulf himself as a reward for his alliance, but the latter ... fled to his own people and lived for twenty years afterwards with no fixed abode.\\" (Sean Duffy, 1997, p. 46). According to Orderic Vitalis, Muirchertach only allowed the Normans to stay in case he needed their support to fight Magnus if he were to violate their treaty and attack the Irish. However, after the Norwegian King's death at the hands of the Ulaid, Muirchertach turned against the English rebels and forced them out of Ireland, possibly in an attempt to make amends with Henry. Indeed, Henry had imposed sanctions on Irish trade for their assistance in helping the rebels, but Muirchertach was able to negotiate the lifting of the embargo (possibly by handing Arnulf over to the English), while also again demonstrating his skill in diplomacy. However, it does seem unlikely that Muirchertach would have turned against the Normans. It is possible Arnulf was not even in Ireland at the time of Magnus's death. The marriage between Muirchertach's daughter and Arnulf went ahead regardless, and later, the High King wrote to the English bishop Anselm of Canterbury, thanking him for intervening with Henry on the behalf of his son- in-law. It is possible Henry would have executed Arnulf otherwise. Although Arnulf was pardoned, the de Belleme family was never really forgiven by Henry for the rebellion. Scotland and the Isles Following the death of Magnus Barefoot in 1103 and the withdrawal of Norwegian military forces from the Irish Sea area, Muircherteach resumed his attempts to expand Irish power in the region. Irish influence in the area began to dominate the lands, at the expense of the Norse. He was able to re-install his nephew Diarmuit as King of the Isle of Man in the year 1111. With direct control of the Isle of Man, he also exercised control over the other Islands, close to the Scottish mainland. At the time, Scotland was ruled by King Edgar. In 1105, Muirchertach received the gift of a camel from Edgar. This is seen by modern historians as significant as such an exotic animal was very rare. There are several possibilities, but this period of Scottish history is not very well documented in comparison with other areas of the British Isles. Even the details of Edgar's reign are relatively unknown. It has. been noted that there would have been many Irish clerics in the court of Edgar, so it is likely he was in contact with the King of Scotland. Furthermore, it has been suggested it is possible Edgar sent the gift as either a rewards or thanks, or an effort to make peace. Muirchertach's fleets were documented to be active in the area at the time. It is possible Muirchertach became involved with ongoing civil wars and rebellions in Scotland, and supported rebels fighting against the King. Or it could have been the other way around, where the High King supported Edgar as he fought against rebellious subjects. Other reasons for this gift may be that Muirchertach's fleets were plundering the Scottish coast, and Edgar wanted to make peace, or some lesser Irish Kings from Ulster were raiding the coast of Scotland and Edgar requested Muirchertach's assistance in stopping them from doing so, and reign in his own subjects as to stop the from attacking Scotland. Either way, it is evident Muirchertach's influence reached as far as Scotland, and that Edgar viewed the High King as either valuable ally or a serious threat, and that peace with him was the best option.  Later life and death  By 1100, Muirchertach controlled almost all of the island, apart from the north-western territory of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill who, under the leadership of King Domnall Ua Lochlainn continued to remain defiant. However, as the conflict between Muirchertach and Domnall was reduced to a stalemate, Muirchertach became less committed to war and began focusing on other aspects of his rule. In the period of 1101-1112 he, like his father Toirdelbach Ua Briain, presided over the Synod of Cashel, and was able to influence reforms in the church, notably relating to marriage. He also created more laws, and reformed aspects of the justice system. He presented more gifts to the church. Like many rulers, not only in Ireland but throughout Europe, he seemed to realise having the Catholic Church on his side was important to a successful reign. However, conflict with Ua Lochlainn flared again in 1112 when Domnall defied Muircherteach by marching from his Kingdom in the North south to Dublin, where he burned Fingal and carried away many captives and herds of cattle. This led Muirchertach to return once more to the North to deal with Domnall, but a peace was again organised by the abbot of Armagh, who again intervened to organise a truce. After a month-long stand-off, matters were settled, and Muirchertach returned home to Munster. In 1114, the King became \\"sick to the point of a living skeleton\\", and his brother Diarmuit took advantage of the High King's misfortune to steal the Kingship and banish Muirchertach. However, the next year, Muirchertach miraculously regained his strength and returned to his home, from where he launched campaigns against Diarmuit. He finally managed to capture his rebellious brother in 1115, but his High Kingship seemed to be disintegrating. The young Toirdelbach Ua Conchobhair, King of Connacht, son of Muirchertach's old rival Ruadhr√≠ na Saide Buide, and Muirchertach's nephew, at only twenty-seven years of age, was making quite a name for himself in the political landscape of Ireland. He launched repeated invasions of Munster, which Muirchertach struggled to repel in his weakened position. Muirchertach was further weakened by rebellions by the MacCarthy M√≥r Dynasty in southern Munster, who had been living under the rule of the O'Brien Dynasty for over a century. These rebellions were supported by Ua Conchobhair, who managed to successfully invade and partition the Kingdom of Munster in the hear 1118. Munster was divided into three Kingdoms: the Kingdom of Thomond under the O'Brien dynasty, the Kingdom of Desmond under the MacCarthy M√≥r dynasty, and the Kingdom of Airg√≠alla under the Kennedys, although the latter was short-lived. Muirchertach apparently went into retirement having lost his High Kingship, and died at Lismore, modern County Waterford a year later in 1119. He was succeeded Toirdelbach Ua Conchobhair as High King of Ireland, who would prove to be one of the greatest High Kings in the History of Ireland. Although the O'Briens never reclaimed the High Kingship, the Kingdom of Thomond remained a powerful kingdom for the next few centuries. Assessments Anthony Candon (1979, p. 398) remarked of √ì Briain: > Muirchertach √ì Briain was an ambitious, modernising and outward-looking king > whose goal was to make himself king of Ireland as much as William Rufus and > Henry I were kings of England; in reality his position was, perhaps, more > analogous to that of Philip I in France ... but his actually authority in > Ireland, especially at the height of his power in the first years of the > twelfth century, greatly exceeded that of Phillip in France. ...

In the latter regard, Candon (1979, p. 415) views > Ua Briain's activities in the Irish Sea area [as] a mixture of old and new, > of pragmstisim and idealism ...

In another article, entitled A Quick Primer and History, Richards relaxes the criticism in the manifesto against digital video, noting that it can \\"have a place in Remodernist cinema\\" but that it should be given a new language, and that it currently \\"mimic(s) film\\". The article also broadens the aim of the movement, explaining the common bond among Remodernist filmmakers being a search for truth, knowledge, authenticity and spirituality in their work, but having different approaches on achieving that goal.\\"Remodernist Film\\", MungBeing, October 4, 2009 Retrieved October 5, 2009 Peter Rinaldi, analyzes the manifesto and shares his \\"personal thoughts\\" on it in his essay, The Shore as seen from The Deep Sea.

According to legend, Kyiv was founded by three brothers, Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv, and their sister Lybid. Kyiv is named after Kyi, the eldest brother. The exact century of the city foundation has not been determined. Legend has it that the emergence of a great city on the future location of Kyiv was prophesied by St. Andrew (d. AD 60/70), who was fascinated by the spectacular location on the hilly shores of the Dnieper River. The city is thought to have existed as early as the 6th century, initially as a Slavic settlement. Gradually acquiring eminence as the center of the East Slavic civilization, Kyiv reached its Golden Age as the center of the Kyivan Rus in the 10th‚Äì12th centuries. Its political, but not cultural, importance started to decline when, in 1169, it was pillaged by the troops of Andrey Bogolyubsky, old town destroyed, and the capital moved to Vladimir. This was followed by numerous sackings of Kyiv by Rus princes until the town was completely destroyed during the Mongol invasion in 1240. In the following centuries Kyiv was a provincial capital of marginal importance in the outskirts of the territories controlled by its powerful neighbors: the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Grand Duchy of Moscow, later the Russian Empire. A Christian city since 988, it still played an important role in preserving the traditions of Orthodox Christianity, especially at times of domination by Catholic Poland, and later the atheist Soviet Union. The city prospered again during the Russian industrial revolution in the late 19th century. In the turbulent period following the Russian Revolution Kyiv, caught in the middle of several conflicts, quickly went through becoming the capital of several short-lived Ukrainian states. From 1921 the city was part of the Soviet Union, since 1934 as a capital of Soviet Ukraine. In World War II, the city was destroyed again, almost completely, but quickly recovered in the post-war years becoming the third most important city of the Soviet Union, the capital of the second most populous Soviet republic. It now remains the capital of Ukraine, independent since 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Kyivan Rus to the Mongol invasion The Baptism of Kyivans, a painting by Klavdiy Lebedev. According to a legend, East Slavs founded Kyiv in the 5th century. The legend of Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv speaks of a founder-family consisting of a Slavic tribal leader Kyi, the eldest, his brothers Schek and Khoriv, and also their sister Lybid, who founded the city. Kyiv () is translated as \\"belonging to Kyi\\" or as \\"Kyi's place\\". The non-legendary time of the founding of the city is harder to ascertain. Slavic settlement existed in the area from the end of the 5th century, that later developed into the city.Tolochko P. P., Ivakin G. Y., Vermenych Y.V. Kyiv. in Encyclopedia of Ukrainian History (–ï–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥—ñ—è —ñ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—ó –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏). ‚Äî Kyiv: Naukova Dumka, 2007. ‚Äî vol. 4. ‚Äî P. 201-218. Some western historians (e.g. Kevin Alan Brook) speculate that Kyiv was founded by Khazars or Magyars. Brook posits that Kyiv is a Turkic place name (K√ºi = riverbank + ev = settlement). However, the Primary Chronicle (a main source of information about the early history of the area) mentions Slavic Kyivans telling Askold and Dir that they lived without a local ruler and paid tribute to the Khazars - an event attributed to the 9th century. Brook believes that during the 8th and 9th centuries Kyiv functioned as an outpost of the Khazar empire. A hill-fortress, called Sambat (Old Turkic for \\"high place\\") was built to defend the area. Whatever the precise circumstances and date of its foundation, Kyiv constituted a nodal point on important ancient trade-routes, standing as it does near the confluence of the Dnieper and Desna river systems. The Dnieper came to serve as the standard route between Scandinavia and the Byzantine Empire, while the Desna gave the area water-borne access (via portages) to the Don and Oka-Volga basins. According to the Hustyn Chronicle (, Hustyns'kyi litopys), Askold and Dir (Haskuldr and Dyri) ruled the Rus' Khaganate at least in 842.Suszko, Henryk (2003). Latopis husty≈Ñski. Opracowanie, przek≈Çad i komentarze. Slavica Wratislaviensia CXXIV. Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Wroc≈Çawskiego. ; Tolochko, Oleksiy (2010). The Hustyn' Chronicle. (Harvard Library of Early Ukrainian Literature: Texts). They were Varangian princes, probably of Swedish origin, but not Rurikids. According to the Annals of St. Bertin (Annales Bertiniani) for the year 839, Louis the Pious, the Frankish emperor, came to the conclusion that the people called Rhos (qui se, id est gentem suum, Rhos vocari dicebant) belonged to the gens of the Swedes (eos gentis esse Sueonum). According to the Primary Chronicle, Oleg of Novgorod (Helgi of Holmgard) conquered Kyiv in 882. He was a relative of Rurik, a Varangian pagan chieftain.DNA Testing of the Rurikid and Gediminid Princes The date given for Oleg's conquest of the town in the Primary Chronicle is uncertain, and some historians, such as Omeljan Pritsak and Constantine Zuckerman, dispute this account and maintain that Khazar rule continued until as late as the 920s (documentary evidence exists to support this assertion ‚Äî see the Kyivan Letter and the Schechter Letter). From Oleg's seizure of the city until 1169 Kyiv functioned as the capital of Kyivan Rus, which was ruled by the Varangian Rurikid dynasty which gradually became Slavicized. The Kyivan Grand Princes had traditional primacy over the other rulers of the land and the Kyiv princehood was a valuable prize in an intra-dynastic system. In 968 the city withstood a siege by the nomadic Pechenegs. In 988, by order of the Grand Prince Vladimir I of Kyiv (St. Vladimir or Volodymyr), the city residents accepted baptism en-masse in the Dnieper river, an event which symbolized the Baptism of Kyivan Rus to Orthodox Christianity. Kyiv reached the height of its position - its political and cultural Golden Age - in the middle of the 11th century under Vladimir's son Yaroslav the Wise (Grand Prince from 1019 to 1054). In 1051, prince Yaroslav assembled the bishops at St. Sophia Cathedral and appointed Hilarion as the first native-born metropolitan bishop of the Kyivan Rus - a decision reflecting an anti-Byzantine bias. In 1054 the Kyivan Church did not take note of the definitive East‚ÄìWest Schism in Christianity, maintaining very good relations with Rome (note for example prince Iziaslav I of Kyiv's request to Pope Gregory VII to extend to Kyivan Rus \\"the patronage of St. Peter\\", which the Pope fulfilled by sending Iziaslav a crown from Rome in 1075).Catherine Evtuhov, Stephen Kotkin, The Cultural Gradient: The Transmission of Ideas in Europe, 1789‚Äì1991. p.40. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc., Lanham, Maryland, 2003. Following the fragmentation of the Kyivan Rus polity, the Principality of Kyiv emerged. Subsequent years saw rivalries of the competing princes of the dynasty and the weakening of Kyiv's political influence, although Kyiv temporarily prevailed after the defeat of Polotsk at the Battle on the river Nemiga (1067) that also led to the burning of Minsk. In 1146 the next Ruthenian bishop, Klym Smoliatych (Kliment of Smolensk), was appointed to serve as the Metropolitan of Kyiv. In 1169 Andrei of Suzdal (Bogolyubsky) sent an army against Mstislav Iziaslavich and Kyiv. Led by one of his sons, it consisted of the forces of eleven other princes, representing three of the main branches of the Rurikid dynasty against the fourth, the Iziaslavichi of Volynia. The allies were victorious, and sacked the city for three days. They left the old town and the prince's hall in ruins, and took many pieces of religious artwork - including the Theotokos of Vladimir icon - from nearby Vyshhorod.Janet Martin, Medieval Russia:980‚Äì1584, (Cambridge University Press, 1996), 100. Bogolyubsky established a new capital at Vladimir. Although he lost Kyiv five years later, the prestige from this conquest of Kyiv allowed the Principality of Vladimir-Suzdal to take a leading role as the predecessor of the modern Russian state. In 1203 Prince Rurik Rostislavich captured and burned Kyiv. In the 1230s different Rus' princes besieged and ravaged the city several times. Then Mongol-Tatar forces led by Batu Khan besieged and then completely destroyed Kyiv on 6 December 1240. The Mongols had originally planned to take Kyiv unharmed, but upon their arrival, the garrison threw down the bodies of the Mongol diplomats sent to urge them to surrender. In revenge the Mongols broke down the gates and slaughtered much of the population, then razed the city.

(in Ukrainian) were forced to accept Mongol/Tatar overlordship. In 1245, Petro Akerovych (of Ruthenian origin), the Metropolitan of Kyiv, participated in the First Council of Lyon, where he informed Catholic Europe of the Mongol/Tatar threat. In 1299, Maximus (of Greek origin), the Metropolitan of Kyiv, eventually moved the seat of the Metropolitanate from Kyiv to Vladimir-on-Kliazma, keeping the title. Since 1320, Kyiv was the site of a new Catholic bishopric, when Henry, a Dominican friar, was appointed the first missionary Bishop of Kyiv.Rowell, S.C. (1994). Lithuania Ascending: A Pagan Empire Within East-Central Europe, 1295-1345. Cambridge University Press, p.209. In the early 1320s, a Lithuanian army led by Gediminas defeated a Slavic army led by Stanislav of Kyiv at the Battle on the Irpen' River, and conquered the city. The Tatars, who also claimed Kyiv, retaliated in 1324‚Äì1325, so while Kyiv was ruled by a Lithuanian prince, it had to pay a tribute to the Golden Horde. Grand Duchy of Lithuania Kyiv in Lithuania in the map produced in 1562. Kyiv became a part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania after the Battle at Blue Waters in 1362, when Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, beat a Golden Horde army. During the period between 1362 and 1471, Kyiv was ruled by Lithuanian princes from different families. By order of Casimir Jagiellon, the Principality of Kyiv was abolished and the Kyiv Voivodship was established in 1471. Lithuanian statesman Martynas Go≈°tautas was appointed as the first voivode of Kyiv the same year; his appointment was met by hostility from locals. The city was frequently attacked by Crimean Tatars and in 1482 was destroyed again by Crimean Khan Me√±li I Giray. Despite its diminished political significance, the city still played an important role as seat of the local Orthodox metropolitan. Starting in 1494, however, the city's local autonomy (Magdeburg rights) gradually increased in a series of acts of Lithuanian Grand Dukes and Polish Kings, finalized by a charter granted by Sigismund I the Old in 1516. Kyiv had a Jewish community of some significance in the early sixteenth century. The tolerant Sigismund II Augustus granted equal rights to Kyiv's Jews on the grounds that they paid the same taxes as Podil's burghers. Polish sponsorship of Jewish settlement in Kyiv added fuel to the conflict that already existed between the Orthodox and Catholic churches.Hamm, Michael F. (1993). Kiev: A Portrait, 1800‚Äì1917. p.117. Princeton University Press, New Jersey. Kingdom of Poland Coat of arms of Kyiv In 1569, under the Union of Lublin that formed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Kyiv with other Ukrainian territories was transferred to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, and it became a capital of the Kyiv Voivodeship. Its role of Orthodox center strengthened due to expansion of Roman Catholicism under Polish rule. In 1632, Peter Mogila, the Orthodox Metropolitan of Kyiv and Galicia established the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, an educational institution aimed to preserve and develop Ukrainian culture and Orthodox faith despite Polish Catholic oppression. Although ruled by the church, the academy provided students with educational standards close to universities of Western Europe (including multilingual training) and became the foremost educational center, both religious and secular. In 1648 Bohdan Khmelnytsky's Cossacks triumphantly entered Kyiv in the course of their uprising establishing the rule of their Cossack Hetmanate in the city. The Zaporizhian Host had a special status within the newly formed political entity. The complete sovereignty of Hetmanate did not last long as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth refused to recognize it and resumed hostilities. In January 1654 Khmelnytsky decided to sign the Treaty of Pereyaslav with Tsardom of Russia to obtain a military support against the Polish Crown. However, in November 1656 the Muscovites concluded the Truce of Vilna with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth,Frost, Robert I. (2004). After the deluge: Poland-Lithuania and the Second Northern War, 1655-1660, Cambridge University Press, pp. 81-82. which was approved by Bohdan Khmelnytsky.A letter of Bohdan Khmelnytsky to the Tsar Alexis, 1656 After his death, in the atmosphere of sharp conflicts his successor became Ivan Vyhovsky who signed the Treaty of Hadiach.

According to Vyhovsky original intention, Kyiv was to become the capital of the Grand Duchy of Ruthenia on the limited federate rights within the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìRuthenian Commonwealth. However, this part of the Treaty was removed during the ratification. In the meantime, Vyhovsky's opponent Yuri Khmelnytsky signed the Second Treaty of Pereyaslav in October 1659 with a representative of Russian tsar.Subtelny, Orest (1988). Ukraine: A History, 1st edition. p. 145. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. Russian Empire On January 31, 1667, the Truce of Andrusovo was concluded, in which the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth ceded Smolensk, Severia and Chernigov, and, on paper only for a period of two years, the city of Kyiv to the Tsardom of Russia. The Eternal Peace of 1686 acknowledged the status quo and put Kyiv under the control of Russia for the centuries to come. Kyiv slowly lost its autonomy, which was finally abolished in 1775 by the Empress Catherine the Great. None of the Polish-Russian treaties concerning Kyiv have ever been ratified.Eugeniusz Romer, O wschodniej granicy Polski z przed 1772 r., w: Ksiƒôga PamiƒÖtkowa ku czci Oswalda Balzera, t. II, Lw√≥w 1925, s. [358]. In 1834, St. Vladimir University was established in Kyiv (now known as National Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv). The Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko cooperated with its geography department as a field researcher and editor. However, the Magdeburg Law existed in Kyiv till that year, when it was abolished by the Decree of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia on December 23, 1834. gates to the Monastery of the Caves in the 1890s. Even after Kyiv and the surrounding region ceased being a part of Poland, Poles continued to play an important role. In 1812 there were over 43,000 Polish noblemen in Kyiv province, compared to only approximately 1,000 Russian nobles. Typically the nobles spent their winters in the city of Kyiv, where they held Polish balls and fairs.Michael F. Hamm. (1995). Kiev: A Portrait, 1800‚Äì1917. Princeton: Princeton University Press pg. 225 Until the mid-eighteenth century Kyiv (Polish Kij√≥w) was Polish in culture.Timothy Snyder. (2003). The Reconstruction of Nations. New Haven: Yale University Press. pp. 120-122 although Poles made up no more than ten percent of Kyiv's population and 25% of its voters. During the 1830s Polish was the language of Kyiv's educational system, and until Polish enrollment in Kyiv's university of St. Vladimir was restricted in the 1860s they made up the majority of that school's student body. The Russian government's cancellation of Kyiv city's autonomy and its placement under the rule of bureaucrats appointed from St. Petersburg was largely motivated by fear of Polish insurrection in the city. Warsaw factories and fine Warsaw shops had branches in Kyiv. J√≥zef Zawadzki, founder of Kyiv's stock exchange, served as the city's mayor in the 1890s. Kyivan Poles tended to be friendly towards the Ukrainian national movement in the city, and some took part in Ukrainian organizations.Michael F. Hamm. (1995). Kiev: A Portrait, 1800‚Äì1917. Princeton: Princeton University Press pp. 54-55 Indeed, many of the poorer Polish nobles became Ukrainianized in language and culture and these Ukrainians of Polish descent constituted an important element of the growing Ukrainian national movement. Kyiv served as a meeting point where such activists came together with the pro-Ukrainian descendants of Cossack officers from the left bank. Many of them would leave the city for the surrounding countryside in order to try to spread Ukrainian ideas among the peasants. According to the Russian census of 1874, of Kyiv's 127,251 people 38,553 (39%) spoke \\"Little Russian\\" (the Ukrainian language), 12,917 (11 percent) spoke Yiddish, 9,736 (10 percent) spoke Great Russian, 7,863 (6 percent) spoke Polish, and 2,583 (2 percent) spoke German. 48,437 (or 49%) of Kyiv's residents were listed as speaking \\"generally Russian speech (obshcherusskoe narechie).\\" Such people were typically Ukrainians and Poles who could speak enough Russian to be counted as Russian-speaking.Michael F. Hamm. (1995). Kiev: A Portrait, 1800‚Äì1917. Princeton: Princeton University Press pg. 103 From the late 18th century until the late 19th century, city life was increasingly dominated by Russian military and ecclesiastical concerns. Russian Orthodox Church institutions formed a significant part of Kyiv's infrastructure and business activity at that time. In the winter 1845‚Äì1846, the historian Mykola Kostomarov (Nikolay Kostomarov in Russian) founded a secret political society, the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius, whose members put forward the idea of a federation of free Slavic people with Ukrainians as a distinct group among them rather than a part of the Russian nation. The Brotherhood's ideology was a synthesis of programmes of three movements: Ukrainian autonomists, Polish democrats, and Russian Decembrists in Ukraine. The society was quickly suppressed by the Tsarist authorities in March‚ÄìApril 1847.Hrycak, Jaroslaw (2000). Historia Ukrainy 1772‚Äì1999, pp.54-55. Instytut Europy ≈örodkowo-Wschodniej, Lublin. Following the gradual loss of Ukraine's autonomy and suppression of the local Ukrainian and Polish cultures, Kyiv experienced growing Russification in the 19th century by means of Russian migration, administrative actions (such as the Valuev Circular of 1863), and social modernization. At the beginning of the 20th century, the city was dominated by Russian-speaking population, while the lower classes retained Ukrainian folk culture to a significant extent. According to the census of 1897, of Kyiv's approximately 240,000 people approximately 56% of the population spoke the Russian language, 23% spoke the Ukrainian language, 12.5% spoke Yiddish, 7% spoke Polish and 1% spoke the Belarusian language. Despite the Russian cultural dominance in the city, enthusiasts among ethnic Ukrainian nobles, military and merchants made recurrent attempts to preserve native culture in Kyiv (by clandestine book-printing, amateur theater, folk studies etc.). During the Russian industrial revolution in the late 19th century, Kyiv became an important trade and transportation center of the Russian Empire, specializing in sugar and grain export by railroad and on the Dnieper river. By 1900, the city had also become a significant industrial center, having a population of 250,000. Landmarks of that period include the railway infrastructure, the foundation of numerous educational and cultural facilities as well as notable architectural monuments (mostly merchant- oriented, i.e. Brodsky Choral Synagogue). At that time, a large Jewish community emerged in Kyiv, developing its own ethnic culture and business interests. This was stimulated by the prohibition of Jewish settlement in Russia proper (Moscow and Saint Petersburg) -- as well as further eastwards. Expelled from Kyiv in 1654, Jews probably were not able to settle in the city again until the early 1790s. On December 2, 1827, Nicolas I of Russia expelled Kyiv's seven hundred Jews. In 1836, the Pale of Settlement banned Jews from Kyiv as well, fencing off the city's districts from the Jewish population. Thus, at mid-century Jewish merchants who came to the fairs could stay in Kyiv for up to six months. In 1881 and 1905, notorious pogroms in the city resulted in the death of about 100 Jews. The development of aviation (both military and amateur) became another notable mark of distinction of early 1900s Kyiv. Prominent aviation figures of that period include Kyivites Pyotr Nesterov (aerobatics pioneer) and Igor Sikorsky. The world's first helicopter was built and tested in Kyiv by Sikorsky. In 1892 the first electric tram line of the Russian Empire was established in the Principality of Kyiv. Independence and Civil War St. Michael's Monastery, in the city centre, c.1890‚Äì1905. In 1917 the Central Rada (Tsentralna Rada), a Ukrainian self-governing body headed by the historian Mykhailo Hrushevsky, was established in the city. Later that year, Ukrainian autonomy was declared. On 7 November 1917 it was transformed into an independent Ukrainian People's Republic with the capital in Kyiv. During this short period of independence, Kyiv experienced rapid growth of its cultural and political status. An Academy of Sciences and professional Ukrainian-language theaters and libraries were established by the new government. Later Kyiv became a war zone in the lasting and bloody struggle between Ukrainian, Polish and Russian Bolshevik governments in the time of Russian Revolution, Ukrainian-Soviet War, Polish-Ukrainian War and Polish-Soviet War. Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic After the \\"January Uprising\\" on January 29, 1918 was extinguished, Bolshevik troops took the city by storm in the Battle of Kyiv. The Bolsheviks established Kharkiv as the capital of the Soviets of the Ukraine.The Times, Bolshevists Against The Church, 7 February 1918. By March Kyiv had been occupied by the Germans.The Times, The Central Asian Menace, 21 March 1918 With the withdrawal of German troops after the war, an independent Ukraine was declared in Kyiv under Symon Petliura. It was then briefly occupied by the White armies before the Soviets once more took control in 1920. In May 1920, during the Russo-Polish War Kyiv was briefly captured by the Polish Army but they were driven out by the Red Army.‚ÄúKyiv,‚Äù Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc., 2020-01-03 After the Ukrainian SSR was formed in 1922, Kharkiv was declared its capital. Kyiv, being an important industrial center, continued to grow. In 1925 the first public buses ran on Kyiv streets, and ten years later the first trolleybuses were introduced. In 1927 the suburban areas of Darnytsia, Lanky, Chokolivka, and Nikolska slobidka were included into the city. In 1932 Kyiv became the administrative center of newly created Kyiv Oblast. =1930s= In the 1930s, Kyiv suffered terribly from famine and from Stalinization. In 1932‚Äì33, the city population, like most of the other Ukrainian territories, suffered from the Holodomor. In Kyiv, bread and other food products were distributed to workers by food cards according to daily norm, but even with cards, bread was in limited supply, and citizens were standing overnight in lines to obtain it.Robert Conquest. The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine. New York; Oxford. Oxford University Press, 1986, Kyiv in the 1930s In 1934 the capital of Ukrainian SSR was moved from Kharkiv to Kyiv. The goal was to fashion a new proletariat utopia based on Stalin's blueprints. The city's architecture was made over, but a much greater impact on the population was Soviet social policy, which involved large-scale purges, coercion, and rapid movement toward totalitarianism in which dissent and non-communist organizations were not tolerated.Serhy Yekelchyk, \\"The Making of a 'Proletarian Capital': Patterns of Stalinist Social Policy in Kiev in the mid-1930s,\\" Europe-Asia Studies, November 1998, Vol. 50, Issue 7, pages 1229‚Äì1244. In the 1930s the process of destruction of churches and monuments, which started in the 1920s, reached the most dramatic turn. Churches and structures that were hundreds of years old, such as St. Michael's Golden-Domed Cathedral and the Fountain of Samson, were demolished. Others, such as Saint Sophia Cathedral, were confiscated. The city's population continued to increase mostly by migrants. The migration changed the ethnic demographics of the city from the previous Russian-Ukrainian parity to predominantly Ukrainian, although Russian remained the dominant language. In the 1930s, Kyivans also suffered from the controversial Soviet political policy of that time. While encouraging lower-class Ukrainians to pursue careers and develop their culture (see Ukrainization), the Communist regime soon began harsh oppression of Ukraine's political freedom, autonomy and religion. Recurring political trials were organized in the city to purge \\"Ukrainian nationalists\\", \\"Western spies\\" and opponents of Joseph Stalin inside the Bolshevik party. During this time, numerous historic churches were destroyed or vandalized and the clergy repressed. In the late 1930s, clandestine mass executions began in Kyiv. Thousands of Kyivites (mostly intellectuals and party activists) were arrested in the night, hurriedly court-martialed, shot and buried in mass graves. The main execution sites were Babi Yar and the Bykivnia forest.Mykola Lysenko. Bukivnia: A crime without repentance Tens of thousands were sentenced to GULAG camps. In the same time, the city's economy continued to grow, following Stalin's industrialization policy. World War II During the Second World War, Nazi Germany occupied Kyiv on 19 September 1941 (see the Battle of Kyiv). Overall, the battle proved disastrous for the Soviet side but it significantly delayed the German advances. The delay also allowed the evacuation of all significant industrial enterprises from Kyiv to the central and eastern parts of the Soviet Union, away from the hostilities, where they played a major role in arming the Red Army fighting the Nazis (see, for example, Kyiv Arsenal). Before the evacuation, the Red Army planted more than ten thousand mines throughout Kyiv, controlled by wireless detonators. On 24 September, when the German invaders had settled into the city, the mines were detonated, causing many of the major buildings to collapse, and setting the city ablaze for five days. More than a thousand Germans were killed.Conot, Robert E., Justice at Nuremberg, Carroll & Graf, 1983. p. 225 Kyiv, as seen during World War II. Babi Yar, a location in Kyiv, became a site of one of the most infamous Nazi WWII war crimes. During two days in September 1941, at least 33,771 Jews from Kyiv and its suburbs were massacred at Babi Yar by the SS Einsatzgruppen, according to their own reports. Babi Yar was a site of additional mass murders of captured Soviet citizens over the following years, including Ukrainians, Romani, POWs and anyone suspected in aiding the resistance movement, perhaps as many as 60,000 additional people. In the \\"Hunger Plan\\" prepared ahead of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, with the aim of ensuring that Germans were given priority over food supplies at the expense of everyone else, the inhabitants of Kyiv were defined as \\"superfluous eaters\\" who were to be \\"gotten rid of\\" by the cutting off of all food supplies to the city ‚Äì the food to be diverted to feeding the Wehrmacht troops and Germany's own population. Luckily for the people of Kyiv, this part of the \\"Hunger Plan\\" was never fully implemented. An underground resistance quickly established by local patriots was active until the liberation from Nazi occupation. During the war, Kyiv was heavily bombarded, especially in the beginning of the war and the city was largely destroyed including many of its architectural landmarks (only one building remained standing on the Khreschatyk, a main street of Kyiv). While the whole of Ukraine was a '[Third] Reich commissariat', under a Nazi Reichskommissar, the region surrounding Kiew (as the Germans spell its name) was one of the six subordinate 'general districts', February 1942 ‚Äì 1943 Generalbezirk Kiew, under Generalkommissar Waldemar Magunia (b. 1902 ‚Äì d. 1974, also NSDAP)Nicholas G. Bohatiuk, \\"The Economy of Kiev under Foreign Conquerors, 1941‚Äì1944,\\" Ukrainian Quarterly, March 1986, Vol. 42 Issue 1/2, pp 35-58 contains statistical detail on demography, religion, income, food supply, and the cost of living during the German occupation. The city was liberated by the Red Army on 6 November 1943. For its role during the War the city was later awarded the title Hero City. Post-WWII Ukrainian SSR Despite the end of the war, on September 4‚Äì7, 1945, an anti-semitic pogrom occurred around one hundred Jews were beaten, of whom thirty-six were hospitalized and five died of wounds.Amir Weiner. Making Sense of War: The Second World War and the Fate of the Bolshevik Revolution. Princeton University Press. 2008. p. 192. =1950s-1990s= Post-wartime in Kyiv was a period of rapid socio-economic growth and political pacification. The arms race of the Cold War caused the establishment of a powerful technological complex in the city (both R&D; and production), specializing in aerospace, microelectronics and precision optics. Dozens of industrial companies were created employing highly skilled personnel. Sciences and technology became the main issues of Kyiv's intellectual life. Dozens of research institutes in various fields formed the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR. Coat of arms of Kyiv during the Soviet era. Kyiv also became an important military center of the Soviet Union. More than a dozen military schools and academies were established here, also specializing in high-tech warfare (see also Soviet education). This created a labor force demand which fed migration from rural areas of both Ukraine and Russia. Large suburbs and an extensive transportation infrastructure were built to accommodate the growing population. However, many rural-type buildings and groves have survived on the city's hills, creating Kyiv's image as one of the world's greenest cities. The city grew tremendously in the 1950s through 1980s. Some significant urban achievements of this period include establishment of the Metro, building new river bridges (connecting the old city with Left Bank suburbs), and Boryspil Airport (the city's second, and later international airport). Systematic oppression of pro-Ukrainian intellectuals, conveniently and uniformly dubbed as \\"nationalists\\", was carried under the propaganda campaign against Ukrainian nationalism threatening the Soviet way of life. In cultural sense it marked a new waive of Russification in the 1970s, when universities and research facilities were gradually and secretly discouraged from using Ukrainian. Switching to Russian, as well as choosing to send children to Russian schools was expedient for educational and career advancement. Thus the city underwent another cycle of gradual Russification. Every attempt to dispute Soviet rule was harshly oppressed, especially concerning democracy, Ukrainian SSR's self-government, and ethnic-religious problems. Campaigns against \\"Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism\\" and \\"Western influence\\" in Kyiv's educational and scientific institutions were mounted repeatedly. Due to limited career prospects in Kyiv, Moscow became a preferable life destination for many Kyivans (and Ukrainians as a whole), especially for artists and other creative intellectuals. Dozens of show-business celebrities in modern Russia were born in Kyiv. In the 1970s and later 1980s-1990s, given special permission from the Soviet government, a significant part of the city's Jews migrated to Israel and the West. The Chernobyl accident of 1986 affected city life tremendously, both environmentally and socio-politically. Some areas of the city have been polluted by radioactive dust. However, Kyivans were neither informed about the actual threat of the accident, nor recognized as its victims. Moreover, on May 1, 1986 (a few days after the accident), local CPSU leaders ordered Kyivans (including hundreds of children) to take part in a mass civil parade in the city's center--\\"to prevent panic\\". Later, thousands of refugees from accident zone were resettled in Kyiv. Independent Ukraine After 57 years as the capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union, Kyiv became the capital of independent Ukraine in 1991. The city was the site of mass protests over the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election by supporters of opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko beginning on 22 November 2004 at Independence Square. Much smaller counter-protests in favor of Viktor Yanukovych also took place. Kyiv hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 on 19 and 21 May in the Palace of Sports. Until 2012, the Mayor of Kyiv was Leonid Chernovetsky. See also * Timeline of Kyiv * Grand Prince of Kyiv * Kyiv Voivodeship References Further reading * Cybriwsky, Roman Adrian.

Plot Ever since her husband pronounced her frigid on the night of their wedding, Antonia DeAngelis (Laura Antonelli) has been bedridden. When her husband disappears, she sets off in his horse and buggy on his route to find out what happened to him. She learns about her husband's business, his passions, his political writing, his mistresses, and his indifference to the peasants on her family's land. Her growing knowledge about her husband's life causes her own passions to stir, and she takes over her husband's business, his habits, his thoughts, and even his mistress. She begins an affair with a young foreign doctor, improves the conditions of the peasants, and publishes her husband's writings. In reality, a murder charge has forced Luigi into hiding directly across the street from his own home, where he watches Antonia become his sexual and social equal from behind the slats of a boarded window. Once Antonia became aware of the fact that Luigi was watching her from his hiding place, she opened her windows wide and continued her erotic escapades. This tortured Luigi as he did not know his wife was capable of such passion and eroticism. After the police drop the murder charge, he must decide whether and how to deal with his wife's transformation.

Life and reign  The Chronicle of Fredegar records a story of how Isaac slew Tasso, duke of Tuscany, by deceit for the benefit of the Lombard king Arioald.J.M. Wallace- Hadrill, translator, The Fourth Book of the Chronicle of Fredegar with its Continuations (Westport: Greenwood Press, 1960), p. 58 However, according to Paul the Deacon, it was the patriarch Gregory who killed Tasso, and Tasso was instead the Duke of Friuli with his brother Kakko.Paul the Deacon (4.38) History of the Lombards, translated by William Dudley Foulke, 1907 (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1974), pp. 187f In 638 the Eastern Roman Emperor Heraclius demanded that the new Pope Severinus sign his Ecthesis, a Monothelite profession of faith. Severinus refused; Heraclius denied recognition to the pope and sent an official named Maurice to negotiate with the papacy. Maurice, after arriving in Rome, seized the Lateran and encouraged Isaac to come to the city. Isaac did so; he then briefly resided in the Lateran and with Maurice plundered the palace. Some of the treasure was sent to Heraclius; much of the rest went to the exarch.The Liber Pontificalis dates this to the period when Pope Severinus was \\"bishop-elect\\", in the first months of 640. Raymond Davis (translator), The Book of Pontiffs (Liber Pontificalis), first edition (Liverpool: University of Liverpool Press, 1989), pp. 65f Some time later Maurice attempted to repeat the action, but in order to avoid sharing the wealth he denied recognition to the exarch. Isaac then captured Maurice and had him executed.Davis, Liber Pontificalis, p. 67 The Lombard king Rothari conquered all of the imperial possessions in Liguria, as well as much of Emilia, in around 643.

He began his career as a in 1935 at Hambleton Lodge in Yorkshire before moving to Hambleton House after the war, at one time sharing premises with Ryan Price. In 1947, he moved south, first to Beckhampton, Wiltshire (where he was champion trainer in his first season) and then onto Warren Place, Newmarket (where his one-time son-in-law Henry Cecil would later train). Murless had nineteen classic wins in England and two in Ireland. Of these there were three Epsom Derby wins, with Crepello (1957), St. Paddy (1960) and Royal Palace (1967). Like his Warren Place successor, he also had an outstanding record in The Oaks, saddling no less than five winners: Carrozza (1957), Petite Etoile (1959), Lupe (1970), Altesse Royale (1971) and Mysterious (1973). His greatest horse was Royal Palace who preceded his Derby success by winning the 2,000 Guineas, to which he added the Eclipse and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes the following year. In 1952 he became manager of Eve Stud, owned by Sir Victor Sassoon, and was the mastermind behind its racing success. Murless purchased the property from Sir Victor's widow in 1970 and named it Woodditton Stud. Sir Noel continued the practice of standing stallions there, including the top-class racehorses Connaught and Welsh Pageant. The stallion tradition was maintained when the stud was sold to Mr Yong Nam-Seng of Singapore in 1981.  Training career - Hambleton  Noel Murless commenced training in 1935 when his first winner was Rubin Wood in the Lee Plate at Lanark Racecourse. He first made his mark as a Trainer after the Second World War in 1947 when winning two famous handicaps, the Britannia Stakes at Royal Ascot with Oros and the Steward's Cup at Glorious Goodwood with Closeburn. Oros was a \\"top class mile handicapper\\".The Best Horses of 1947 Timeform Supplement Closeburn was just below the very best sprinters of 1947 and was placed in the Cork and Orrery and July Cup before winning the Stewards Cup under a record weight at the time for a 3-year-old of 8-10.He went on to win the Challenge Stakes in October then run over 6 furlongs. The Bloodstock Breeders Review of 1947 said of Closeburn \\"The credit of breeding the winner goes to his young trainer who, at the end of the season, followed Fred Darling as the \\"Master\\" of the famous Beckhampton stable\\".The Bloodstock Breeders Review 1947  Training career - Beckhampton  1948 was Noel Murless first season at Beckhampton in Wiltshire taking over from Fred Darling. There was immediate success with Queenpot winning the 1,000 Guineas and The Cobbler taking second place in the 2,000 Guineas. Three winners at Royal Ascot included a two-year old Abernant who was to become one of the finest sprinters of the second half of the century. Other significant winners of the year included Goblet, in the Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket and the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood, Gold Mist in Doncaster's Portland Handicap and Royal Forest in the Dewhurst Stakes. The move to Beckhampton also led to King George VI becoming one of Noel Murless's owners who he trained 3 winners for in 1948. Noel was Champion Trainer for the first time in 1948 and also had three (Abernant, Royal Forest and Faux Tirage) out of the first four in the Two Year Old Free Handicap for the year.The Bloodstock Breeders Review 1948 Noel Murless trained another three years at Beckhampton but was not entirely happy according to his biographer Tim Fitzgeorge-Parker.The Guv'nor A Biography of Sir Noel Murless - Tim Fitzgeorge-Parker. Those three years did lead to a second classic winner with Ridge Wood in the 1949 St Leger and the dominance of the sprinting ranks by Abernant who won the King Stand at Royal Ascot in 1949; July Cup at Newmarket, King George Stakes at Goodwood and Nunthorpe Stakes at York in both 1949 and 1950.  Training career - Warren Place  Noel Murless moved to Warren Place in Newmarket towards the end of the 1952 Flat season. Although there were no immediate classic winners the quality of horses was expected to improve as new high spending owners became patrons of the yard. These new owners included the Aga Khan , his son Aly Khan who had offered support prior to the move.The Guv'nor A Biography of Sir Noel Murless - Tim Fitzgeorge-Parker page 65. Noel according to his biography said of Prince Aly Khan he was \\"highly intelligent, a first class judge of a horse and of form and breeding\\". Winners in 1953 included the Cork and Orrery with Blood Test at Royal Ascot and Buckhound in the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket. The Queen's Landau won the Rous Memorial Stakes at Royal Ascot and the Sussex Stakes at the Glorious Goodwood festival in 1954. In the same year at Royal Ascot Gordon Richards won the King Edward VII Stakes on Rashleigh trained by Noel. This race lead ultimately to the up-and-coming young new jockey of the time having his licence removed for 6 months.Lester: The Autobiography of Lester Piggott That jockey was Lester Piggott who in 1955 would take over as Stable jockey for Noel following Sir Gordon Richards retirement. Piggott and Murless together would be a dynamic combination in British Flat Racing for the next decade. A major owner of horses at Warren Place was Sir Victor Sassoon whose Eve Stud Noel managed. In 1955 Victor Sassoon sent the yearling Crepello to Warren Place. Crepello was to win the Dewhurst Stakes in 1956 and the Two Thousand Guineas plus the Derby in 1957. 1967 was probably Noel Murless most successful year as a trainer. Victories included three of the home classics, Eclipse and King George. He was Champion trainer. A win for the Queen's Hopeful Venture in the Wood Ditton at the Craven meeting was followed by victories in the two tradition 1,000 Guineas trials for Cranberry Sauce in the Nell Gwynn and Royal Saint in the Fred Darling. Busted who had been drafted into the stable to lead the classic colts won the Coronation Stakes over 10f at Sandown in April and was deemed too good to continue as a lead horse. The Two Thousand Guineas was won by Royal Palace and the following day Fleet was victorious in the One Thousand Guineas. Royal Palace went on to win the Derby whilst Busted won the Eclipse, King George VI Diamond Stakes and Prix Foy before tendon injury prevented an attempt at the Arc. 63 races were won with winning stakes of ¬£279,775The Guv'nor A Biography of Sir Noel Murless - Tim Fitzgeorge-Parker.

The Indian Shaker Church is a unique blend of American Indian, Catholic, and Protestant beliefs and practices. The Indian Shakers are unrelated to the Shakers of New England (United Society of Believers) and are not to be confused with the Native American Church. History and practices Mud Bay, Eld Inlet, Washington State, circa 1892 As tradition tells, John Slocum (Squ-sacht-um) had died from sickness in 1881 when he revived during his wake reporting a visit to heaven, where he was told by an angel that, \\"you've been a pretty bad Indian\\", and where he received instructions to start a new religion.Ruby, p. 3 When Slocum became ill again several months later, his wife, Mary, began to shake and tremble uncontrollably in prayer. Soon afterward, Slocum recovered and his healing was attributed to Mary's convulsions.Francis, pp. 115-16. The religion is thus named for the shaking of members during religious congregations.Ruby, p. 85 The shaking is reported to have healing powers.Ruby, p. 81 The story is told that Mary had sent for a casket. John was dead. The casket was brought by canoe, down the river. The casket was just coming around the bend in the river when John revived. ... and told the people he had met Jesus and what they were to do. The Indian Shaker Church in Marysville, Washington.The first church was built at Mud Bay outside Olympia, Washington near the homes of church co-founders and brothers Mud Bay Louie and Mud Bay Sam. Indian Shakers originally rejected the Bible and all other written scriptures and instead relied on direct communication between God and the individual. Such Shakers believe that the experience of the Gospel does not require a book, but rather is encoded in the mind and soul in accordance with the will of God. The religion began to be practiced by many unrelated peoples along the Northwest Coast of North America, such as the Klallam, Quinault, Lower Chehalis, Yakama, Hoh, Quileute, Wiyot, Yurok, and Hupa, among others. The second Indian Shaker Church at Mud Bay, built 1910 on the same property as the first 1890s Indian Shaker Church structure, 21 May 2015. Practices reflecting Catholic influence include the use of hand-held candles, the ringing of individual hand bells (to a very loud volume), and the sign of the cross (usually repeated three times). Protestant influence is shown in public testifying and confession of shortcomings. Native elements include brushing or stroking to remove evil influence, counter-clockwise movement of service participants around the room (often with loud stomping), and spontaneous reception of songs from the spirit. Church members are expected to refrain from using alcohol and tobacco. Carefulness, kindness, and supplication to God for help are emphasized. The new religion encountered much opposition and hostility from Euro-Americans. As had happened with the Ghost Dance, there was much misunderstanding and Anglos feared an Indian uprising. For a time, all Indian religious practices were banned by law and the Indian Shakers were included. Many members were imprisoned and chained for their practices. Powell et al. (1976) show two notices posted by the US Indian Service at Quileute Reservation: In the 1960s, a break occurred among Indian Shakers in which one \\"conservative\\" faction continued to reject written religious material while another \\"progressive\\" faction was more tolerant of the use of the Bible and other written material. Indian Shakers continue to practice on the Northwest Coast in Washington, Oregon, California, and British Columbia.

It originated in the mid-19th century as a focus for Slovak nationalist aspirations to break away from the Kingdom of Hungary but its bid for independence was suppressed. The second SNR was more successful, issuing a celebrated declaration of Slovakian independence in 1918, though it too was ultimately dissolved by the state after Czechoslovakia was formed. The third SNR coordinated Slovak resistance to the Nazis and their Slovak puppet government, and evolved into a Communist-controlled organ of state power after the Second World War. Following the 1989 Velvet Revolution it was transformed into the new democratically elected Slovak parliament. A number of mostly short-lived and not particularly influential Slovak National Councils were also proclaimed abroad between the 1920s and 1940s, the last one seeking to mobilise Slovak √©migr√© resistance to Communist rule. First Slovak National Council (1848‚Äì49) The SNR was first established during the revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas, when ƒΩudov√≠t ≈†t√∫r, Jozef Miloslav Hurban and Michal Miloslav Hod≈æa founded it in Vienna on 15 September 1848. It called for the establishment of autonomy for the Slovak people within the Kingdom of Hungary and promoted a document known as the Demands of the Slovak Nation. On 19 September, the SNR declared in an assembly held at Myjava that Slovakia would separate from Hungary and called for a national Slovak uprising. A militia was formed in Vienna and marched into western Slovakia, where people from the Czech lands, Moravia and Slovakia joined it in a bid to foment an uprising. The Hungarian army was able to put down the uprising within a month and forced the militia to retreat to Moravia, executing two of its leaders and depriving ≈†t√∫r, Hurban and Hod≈æa of their citizenship on the grounds of treason. Military engagements continued through the winter and into 1849, but the Slovaks were fully defeated by November 1849. The SNR found itself unable to exercise much authority and ceased to operate by the spring of 1849. Following the suppression of the uprisings in Hungary and Slovakia, the new Austro-Hungarian Emperor, Franz Josef I, sought to co-opt the three Slovak leaders by offering them positions in the state administration. They refused, insisting on their previous demands of a separate Slovak territory within the empire. The Austrian government put them under close surveillance and they were forced to retire from politics. Second Slovak National Council (1914‚Äì19) The second SNR was established on 26 May 1914 under Mat√∫≈° Dula. The outbreak of the First World War a few months later meant that it remained inactive for the next four years, when the Slovaks fought for the Central Powers as part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The final months of the war saw the gradual disintegration of the empire and the revitalisation of the SNR. At a meeting held in Budapest on 12 September 1918, twelve representatives of Slovak parties were nominated to serve as members of the council. It was officially constituted in the town of Turƒçiansky Sv√§t√Ω Martin (now Martin, Slovakia) on 29 October and the following day issued the Martin Declaration, in effect declaring Slovakia's independence and presaging Slovakia's unification with the Czech lands as part of the new state of Czechoslovakia. The occupation of Martin by Hungarian troops prevented the SNR doing much following the declaration, other than issuing around 200 directives, and it was dissolved by the new Czechoslovak government on 8 January 1919 as part of a centralising drive by Vavro ≈†rob√°r, the government's Minister for Slovakia. Third Slovak National Council (1943‚Äì92) In September 1943 the SNR was again constituted to serve as a forum for resistance to the pro-Nazi puppet regime of the Slovak Republic. Its leadership was shared by Karol ≈†midke, representing the Communists, and Jozef Lettrich, representing the non- communists. The creation of the council followed the pattern set in Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, in which the Communists set themselves at the head of a notionally politically diverse popular front to resist Nazi rule. It characterized its task as being \\"to guide the struggle of the Slovak people and at an appropriate moment to take over power and transfer it to the elected representatives of the people\\". The SNR issued the so-called \\"Christmas Agreement\\" setting out a programme for re-establishing Slovakia as part of a reconstituted Czechoslovak state under democratic rule, a stance which was supported by all the major anti-fascist forces. It recognised the leadership of the exiled Czechoslovak leader Eduard Bene≈°, though he was reluctant to recognise it in return. Following the launch of the Slovak National Uprising in 1944, the SNR took charge of areas liberated by the resistance. In February 1945 its representatives set themselves up in Ko≈°ice to take full control of Slovakia. Its membership grew from an initial 41 to 100, split evenly between Communists and non-Communists, with a Board of Commissioners to act as its executive body. Its powers were gradually restricted under the Prague Agreements of 1945‚Äì46 and following the Czechoslovak coup d'√©tat of 1948, when the Communists seized power, the SNR became an instrument of the Communist regime. This situation persisted until the Velvet Revolution of 1989, when the Communists lost power. A constitutional law passed in 1990 restored many of the SNR's former powers and transformed it into a democratically elected parliament, the first free elections to which were held in June 1990. It was renamed the National Council of the Slovak Republic on 1 September 1992 after a new Slovak constitution was promulgated; Slovakia became independent from Czechoslovakia four months later on 1 January 1993. Slovak National Councils abroad Four Slovak National Councils were also proclaimed abroad at various times between 1920 and 1948. The first was established by Franti≈°ek Jehliƒçka in Warsaw in May 1920 but failed to attract support from Slovaks abroad and was dissolved by 1922. Milan Hod≈æa established the second in Paris on 22 November 1939, with himself as president and Peter Pr√≠davok as secretary. Hod≈æa sought to outline proposals for a post-war Czechoslovakian state based on the ≈Ωilina Agreement. However, it was superseded by the creation on 28 January 1940 of a Czecho-Slovak National Council, headed by Hod≈æa, and its presence in France was ended by the country's defeat in the Battle of France six months later. The third SNR abroad was founded in London by Peter Pr√≠davok on 31 December 1943 and advocated that Slovakia should become an independent state in a federated Central Europe. The Czechoslovak government in exile refused to recognise it and it played no part in determining Slovakia's post- war settlement. The fourth and final SNR abroad was the only one to be officially termed the Slovak National Council Abroad (, SNRvZ). It was founded in Rome in May 1948 after the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia, with Karol Sidor, Kon≈°tantin ƒåulen, Jozef Kirschbaum and others as founder members. It sought to restore Slovak statehood and to mobilise Slovak √©migr√©s abroad, through its branches in West Germany, Argentina, Canada, the United States and other countries where Slovaks had settled. In September 1948 it merged with Pr√≠davok's Slovak National Council. A further merger took place in 1960 when the Slovak Liberation Committee joined it to form the Slovak Liberation Council.

They mostly originate in a cumulonimbus cloud and terminate on the ground, called cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning. A less common type of strike, called ground-to-cloud (GC) lightning, is upward propagating lightning initiated from a tall grounded object and reaching into the clouds. About 25% of all lightning events worldwide are strikes between the atmosphere and earth-bound objects. Most are intra-cloud (IC) lightning and cloud-to- cloud (CC), where discharges only occur high in the atmosphere.Cooray, Vernon. (2014). Lightning Flash (2nd Edition) - 1. Charge Structure and Geographical Variation of Thunderclouds. Page 4. Institution of Engineering and Technology. Lightning strikes the average commercial aircraft at least once a year, but modern engineering and design means this is rarely a problem. The movement of aircraft through clouds can even cause lightning strikes. A single lightning event is a \\"flash\\", which is a complex, multi-stage process, some parts of which are not fully understood. Most CG flashes only \\"strike\\" one physical location, referred to as a \\"termination\\". The primary conducting channel, the bright coursing light that may be seen and is called a \\"strike\\", is only about one inch in diameter, but because of its extreme brilliance, it often looks much larger to the human eye and in photographs. Lightning discharges are typically miles long, but certain types of horizontal discharges can be upwards of tens of miles in length. The entire flash lasts only a fraction of a second. Panorama photography taken during a lightning storm over Bucharest, Romania  Strikes  Lightning strikes can injure humans in several different ways: # Direct #* Direct strike ‚Äì the person is part of a flash channel. Enormous quantities of energy pass through the body very quickly, resulting in internal burns, organ damage, explosions of flesh and bone, and nervous system damage. Depending on the flash strength and access to medical services, it may be instantaneously fatal or cause permanent injury and impairment. #* Contact injury ‚Äì an object (generally a conductor) that a person is touching is electrified by a strike. #* Side splash ‚Äì branches of currents \\"jumping\\" from the primary flash channel, electrify the person. #* Blast injuries ‚Äì being thrown and suffering blunt force trauma from the shock wave (if very close) and possible hearing damage from the thunder. # Indirect #* Ground current or \\"step potential\\" ‚Äì Earth surface charges race towards the flash channel during discharge. Because the ground has high impedance, the current \\"chooses\\" a better conductor, often a person's legs, passing through the body. The near- instantaneous rate of discharge causes a potential (difference) over distance, which may amount to several thousand volts per linear foot. This phenomenon is responsible for more injuries and deaths than the above three combined, with reports such as \\"hundreds of reindeer killed by a lightning storm...\\" being a classic example. #* EMPs ‚Äì the discharge process produces an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) which may damage an artificial pacemaker, or otherwise affect normal biological processes. #* Hallucinations may be induced in people located within 200 meters of a severe lightning storm. # Secondary or resultant #* Explosions #* Fires #* Accidents  Injuries  Lightning strikes can produce severe injuries, and have a mortality rate of between 10% and 30%, with up to 80% of survivors sustaining long-term injuries. These severe injuries are not usually caused by thermal burns since the current is too brief to greatly heat up tissues; instead, nerves and muscles may be directly damaged by the high voltage producing holes in their cell membranes, a process called electroporation. In a direct strike, the electrical currents in the flash channel passes directly through the victim. The relatively high voltage drop around poorer electrical conductors (such as a human being), causes the surrounding air to ionize and break down, and the external flashover diverts most of the main discharge current so that it passes \\"around\\" the body, reducing injury. Metallic objects in contact with the skin may \\"concentrate\\" the lightning's energy, given it is a better natural conductor and the preferred pathway, resulting in more serious injuries, such as burns from molten or evaporating metal. At least two cases have been reported where a strike victim wearing an iPod suffered more serious injuries as a result. However, during a flash, the current flowing through the channel and around the body will generate large electromagnetic fields and EMPs, which may induce electrical transients (surges) within the nervous system or pacemaker of the heart, upsetting normal operations. This effect might explain cases where cardiac arrest or seizures followed a lightning strike that produced no external injuries. It may also point to the victim not being directly struck at all, but just being very close to the strike termination. Another effect of lightning on bystanders is to their hearing. The resulting shock wave of thunder can damage the ears. Also, electrical interference to telephones or headphones may result in damaging acoustic noise. Epidemiology A dot density map portraying male and female deaths by a lightning strike in the continental United States between 2007 and 2017. Memorial to a man killed by lightning in London, 1787 About 240,000 incidents regarding lightning strikes happen each year.Ronald L. Holle Annual rates of lightning fatalities by country. (PDF) . 0th International Lightning Detection Conference. 21‚Äì23 April 2008. Tucson, Arizona, USA. Retrieved on 2011-11-08. Annual fatality tolls vary greatly. One estimate is that the annual global death toll is 6,000. On the other hand, according to National Geographic, annually about 2,000 people are killed worldwide by lightning. Therefore, the average human being, according to these figures has roughly a 1 in 60,000 to 80,000 chance of falling victim to lightning in an average lifetime (of about 65-70 years). According to the NOAA, over the last 20 years, the United States averaged 51 annual lightning strike fatalities, placing it in the second position, just behind floods for deadly weather.Lightning Safety Facts. lightningsafety.noaa.gov (archived) In the US, between 9% and 10% of those struck die,Cherington, J. et al. 1999: Closing the Gap on the Actual Numbers of Lightning Casualties and Deaths. Preprints, 11th Conf. on Applied Climatology, 379-80.. with an annual average of 25 deaths in the 2010s decade (16 in 2017). In Kisii in western Kenya, some 30 people die each year from lightning strikes. Kisii's high rate of lightning fatalities occurs because of the frequency of thunderstorms and because many of the area's structures have metal roofs.National Geographic Almanac of Geography (2005), , page 78. These statistics do not reflect the difference between direct strikes, where the victim was part of the lightning pathway, indirect effects of being close to the termination point, like ground currents, and resultant, where the casualty arose from subsequent events, such as fires or explosions. Even the most knowledgeable first responders may not recognize a lightning-related injury, let alone particulars, which a medical examiner, police investigator or on the rare occasion a trained lightning expert may have difficulty identifying to record accurately. This ignores the reality that lightning, as the first event, may assume responsibility for the overall and resulting accident. Direct strike casualties could be much higher than reported numbers. Effect on nature =Impact on vegetation= A green tree which was struck by lightning, exploding the trunk. A eucalyptus tree that was struck by lightning, while two nearby pine trees were untouched, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia. A lightning-struck tree in the Toronto Islands, clearly showing the path that the charge took into the ground. Trees are frequent conductors of lightning to the ground. Since sap is a relatively poor conductor, its electrical resistance causes it to be heated explosively into steam, which blows off the bark outside the lightning's path. In following seasons trees overgrow the damaged area and may cover it completely, leaving only a vertical scar. If the damage is severe, the tree may not be able to recover, and decay sets in, eventually killing the tree. In sparsely populated areas such as the Russian Far East and Siberia, lightning strikes are one of the major causes of forest fires. The smoke and mist expelled by a very large forest fire can cause electric charges, starting additional fires many kilometers downwind. =Shattering of rocks= When water in fractured rock is rapidly heated by a lightning strike, the resulting steam explosion can cause rock disintegration and shift boulders. It may be a significant factor in erosion of tropical and subtropical mountains that have never been glaciated. Evidence of lightning strikes includes erratic magnetic fields.  Electrical and structural damage  A sculpture damaged by lightning in Wellington, New Zealand The Eiffel Tower as a colossal lightning conductor. Photograph taken 1902-06-03 21:02 Telephones, modems, computers and other electronic devices can be damaged by lightning, as harmful overcurrent can reach them through the phone jack, Ethernet cable, or electricity outlet. Close strikes can also generate electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) ‚Äì especially during \\"positive\\" lightning discharges. Lightning currents have a very fast rise time, on the order of 40 kA per microsecond. Hence, conductors of such currents exhibit marked skin effect, causing most of the currents to flow through the outer surface of the conductor. In addition to electrical wiring damage, the other types of possible damage to consider include structural, fire, and property damage. Prevention and mitigations The field of lightning protection systems is an enormous industry worldwide due to the impacts lightning can have on the constructs and activities of humankind. Lightning, as varied in properties measured across orders of magnitude as it is, can cause direct effects or have secondary impacts; lead to the complete destruction of a facility or process or simply cause the failure of a remote electronic sensor; it can result in outdoor activities being halted for safety concerns to employees as a thunderstorm nears an area and until it has sufficiently passed; it can ignite volatile commodities stored in large quantities or interfere with the normal operation of a piece of equipment at critical periods of time. Most lightning protection devices and systems protect physical structures on the earth, aircraft in flight being the notable exception. While some attention has been paid to attempting to control lightning in the atmosphere, all attempts proved extremely limited in success. Chaff and silver iodide crystal concepts were devised to deal directly with the cloud cells and were dispensed directly into the clouds from an overflying aircraft. The chaff was devised to deal with the electrical manifestations of the storm from within, while the silver iodide salting technique was devised to deal with the mechanical forces of the storm. = Lightning protection systems = An example of a standard, pointed-tip, air terminal. Hundreds of devices, including lightning rods and charge transfer systems, are used to mitigate lightning damage and influence the path of a lightning flash. A lightning rod (or lightning protector) is a metal strip or rod connected to earth through conductors and a grounding system, used to provide a preferred pathway to ground if lightning terminates on a structure. The class of these products are often called a \\"finial\\" or \\"air terminal\\". A lightning rod or \\"Franklin rod\\" in honor of its famous inventor, Benjamin Franklin, is simply a metal rod, and without being connected to the lightning protection system, as was sometimes the case in the old days, will provide no added protection to a structure. Other names include \\"lightning conductor\\", \\"arrester\\", and \\"discharger\\"; however, over the years these names have been incorporated into other products or industries with a stake in lightning protection. Lightning arrester, for example, often refers to fused links that explode when a strike occurs to a high voltage overhead power line to protect the more expensive transformers down the line by opening the circuit. In reality, it was an early form of a heavy duty surge protection device (SPD). Modern arresters, constructed with metal oxides, are capable of safely shunting abnormally high voltage surges to ground while preventing normal system voltages from being shorted to ground. In 1962, the USAF placed protective lightning strike- diversion tower arrays at all of the Italian and Turkish Jupiter MRBM nuclear armed missiles sites after two strikes partially arming the missiles. = Monitoring and warning systems = iStrike Lightning Siren System w/ Strobe currently in use in Noblesville, IN A Thor Guard lightning prediction system The exact location of a lightning strike or when it will occur is still impossible to predict. However, products and systems have been designed of varying complexities to alert people as the probability of a strike increases above a set level determined by a risk assessment for the location's conditions and circumstances. One significant improvement has been in the area of detection of flashes through both ground and satellite-based observation devices. The strikes and atmospheric flashes are not predicted, however the level of detail recorded by these technologies has vastly improved in the past 20 years. Although commonly associated with thunderstorms at close range, lightning strikes can occur on a day that seems devoid of clouds. This occurrence is known as \\"A Bolt From the Blue\\";NWS Pueblo Lightning Page ‚Äì Bolts From The Blue. Crh.noaa.gov. Retrieved on 2011-11-08. lightning can strike up to 10 miles from a cloud. Lightning interferes with AM (amplitude modulation) radio signals much more than FM (frequency modulation) signals, providing an easy way to gauge local lightning strike intensity.Joni Jantunen et al. \\"Detection of lightning\\" Issue date: August 7, 2007 To do so, one should tune a standard AM medium wave receiver to a frequency with no transmitting stations, and listen for crackles amongst the static. Stronger or nearby lightning strikes will also cause cracking if the receiver is tuned to a station. As lower frequencies propagate further along the ground than higher ones, the lower medium wave (MW) band frequencies (in the 500‚Äì600 kHz range) can detect lightning strikes at longer distances; if the longwave band (153‚Äì279 kHz) is available, using it can increase this range even further. Lightning detection systems have been developed and may be deployed in locations where lightning strikes present special risks, such as public parks. Such systems are designed to detect the conditions which are believed to favor lightning strikes and provide a warning to those in the vicinity to allow them to take appropriate cover. = Personal safety = The U.S. National Lightning Safety InstitutePersonal Lightning Safety Tips National Lightning Safety Institute . Accessed July 2008 advises American citizens to have a plan for their safety when a thunderstorm occurs and to commence it as soon as the first lightning is seen or thunder heard. This is important as lightning can strike without rain actually falling. If thunder can be heard at all, then there is a risk of lightning. The safest place is inside a building or a vehicle. Risk remains for up to 30 minutes after the last observed lightning or thunder. The National Lightning Safety Institute recommends using the F-B (flash to boom) method to gauge distance to a lightning strike. The flash of a lightning strike and resulting thunder occur at roughly the same time. But light travels 300,000 kilometers in a second, almost a million times the speed of sound. Sound travels at the slower speed of about 340 m/s (depending on the temperature), so the flash of lightning is seen before thunder is heard. A method to determine the distance between lightning strike and viewer, involves counting the seconds between the lightning flash and thunder. Then, dividing by three to determine the distance in kilometers, or by five for miles. Immediate precautions against lightning should be taken if the F-B time is 25 seconds or less, that is, if the lightning is closer than 8 km or 5 miles. A report suggested that it did not matter whether a person was standing up, squatting, or lying down when outside during a thunderstorm, because lightning can travel along the ground; this report suggested it was safest to be inside a solid structure or vehicle.JONEL ALECCIA, June 20, 2014, NBC News, Debunked: 5 Lightning Myths That Could Kill You, Accessed June 20, 2014 In the United States, the average annual death toll from lightning is around 51 deaths per year, although more recently, in the period 2009 to 2018, the U.S. has averaged only 27 lightning fatalities per year. The riskiest activities include fishing, boating, camping, and golf. A person injured by lightning does not carry an electrical charge, and can be safely handled to apply first aid before emergency services arrive. Lightning can affect the brainstem, which controls breathing.Dayton, L (1993). \\"Science: Secrets of a bolt from the blue\\", New Scientist, 1904. Several studies conducted in South Asia and Africa suggest that the dangers of lightning are not taken sufficiently seriously there. A research team from the University of Colombo found that even in neighborhoods which had experienced deaths from lightning, no precautions were taken against future storms. An expert forum convened in 2007 to address how to raise awareness of lightning and improve lightning protection standards, and expressed concern that many countries had no official standards for the installation of lightning rods.  Notable incidents  All events associated or suspected of causing damage are called \\"lightning incidents\\" due to four important factors. * Forensic evidence of a lightning termination, in the best investigated examples, are minuscule (a pit in metal smaller than a pen point) or inconclusive (dark coloration). * The object struck may explode or subsequent fires destroy all of the little evidence that may have been available immediately after the strike itself. * The flash channel and discharge itself are not the only causes of injury, ignition or damages, i.e., ground currents or explosions of flammables. * Human sensory acuity is not as fine as that of the milliseconds duration of a lightning flash, and our ability to observe this event is subject to the brain's inability to comprehend it. Lightning detection systems are coming online, both satellite and land based, however their accuracy is still measured in the hundreds to thousands of feet, rarely allowing them to pinpoint the exact location of the termination. As such it is often inconclusive, albeit highly probably a lightning flash was involved, hence categorizing it as a \\"lightning incident\\" covers all bases. = Earth-bound = * 1660s: In 1660, lightning ignited the gunpowder magazine at Osaka Castle, Japan; the resultant explosion set the castle on fire.

Category:Lightning ay:Lliju lliju ","title":"Lightning strike"},{"id":"2449747","text":"The Spirit of Laws (French: De l'esprit des lois, originally spelled De l'esprit des loix) is a treatise on political theory, as well as a pioneering work in comparative law, published in 1748 by Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu. Originally published anonymously, partly because Montesquieu's works were subject to censorship, its influence outside France was aided by its rapid translation into other languages. In 1750 Thomas Nugent published the first English translation.Now best known as published in New York by Hafner Press in 1949, using Nugent's original version and with an introduction by Franz Neumann. In 1751 the Roman Catholic Church added De l'esprit des lois to its Index Librorum Prohibitorum (\\"List of Prohibited Books\\"). Yet Montesquieu's treatise had an enormous influence on the work of many others, most notably: Catherine the Great, who produced Nakaz (Instruction); the Founding Fathers of the United States Constitution; and Alexis de Tocqueville, who applied Montesquieu's methods to a study of American society, in Democracy in America. Macaulay offers us a hint of Montesquieu's continuing importance when he writes in his 1827 essay entitled \\"Machiavelli\\" that \\"Montesquieu enjoys, perhaps, a wider celebrity than any political writer of modern Europe.\\" Montesquieu spent around twenty-one years researching and writing De l'esprit des lois, covering a huge range of topics including law, social life and the study of anthropology, and providing more than 3,000 commendations.Cohler, et al., \\"Introduction\\" to the 1989 Cambridge UP ed. In this treatise Montesquieu argued that political institutions needed, for their success, to reflect the social and geographical aspects of the particular community. He pleaded for a constitutional system of government with separation of powers, the preservation of legality and civil liberties, and the end of slavery. Constitutional theory In his classification of political systems, Montesquieu defines three main kinds: republican, monarchical, and despotic. As he defines them, Republican political systems vary depending on how broadly they extend citizenship rights‚Äîthose that extend citizenship relatively broadly are termed democratic republics, while those that restrict citizenship more narrowly are termed aristocratic republics. The distinction between monarchy and despotism hinges on whether or not a fixed set of laws exists that can restrain the authority of the ruler: if so, the regime counts as a monarchy; if not, it counts as despotism. = Principles that motivate citizen behaviour according to Montesquieu = Driving each classification of political system, according to Montesquieu, must be what he calls a \\"principle\\". This principle acts as a spring or motor to motivate behavior on the part of the citizens in ways that will tend to support that regime and make it function smoothly. * For democratic republics (and to a somewhat lesser extent for aristocratic republics), this spring is the love of virtue‚Äîthe willingness to put the interests of the community ahead of private interests. * For monarchies, the spring is the love of honor‚Äîthe desire to attain greater rank and privilege. * Finally, for despotisms, the spring is the fear of the ruler. A political system cannot last long if its appropriate principle is lacking. Montesquieu claims, for example, that the English failed to establish a republic after the Civil War (1642‚Äì1651) because the society lacked the requisite love of virtue. Liberty and the separation of powers A second major theme in The Spirit of the Laws concerns political liberty and the best means of preserving it. \\"Political liberty\\" is Montesquieu's concept of what we might call today personal security, especially in so far as this is provided for through a system of dependable and moderate laws. He distinguishes this view of liberty from two other misleading views of political liberty. The first is the view that liberty consists in collective self-government‚Äîi.e. that liberty and democracy are the same. The second is the view that liberty consists in being able to do whatever one wants without constraint. Not only are these latter two not genuine political liberty, he maintains, but they can both be hostile to it. Political liberty is not possible in a despotic political system, but it is possible, though not guaranteed, in republics and monarchies. Generally speaking, establishing political liberty on a sound footing requires two things: *The separation of the powers of government. :Building on and revising a discussion in John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, Montesquieu argues that the executive, legislative, and judicial functions of government should be assigned to different bodies, so that attempts by one branch of government to infringe on political liberty might be restrained by the other branches. (Habeas corpus is an example of a check that the judicial branch has on the executive branch of government.) In a lengthy discussion of the English political system, he tries to show how this might be achieved and liberty secured, even in a monarchy. He also notes that liberty cannot be secure where there is no separation of powers, even in a republic. *The appropriate framing of civil and criminal laws so as to ensure personal security. :Montesquieu intends what modern legal scholars might call the rights to \\"robust procedural due process\\", including the right to a fair trial, the presumption of innocence and the proportionality in the severity of punishment. Pursuant to this requirement to frame civil and criminal laws appropriately to ensure political liberty (i.e., personal security), Montesquieu also argues against slavery and for the freedom of thought, speech and assembly. This book concerns explicit laws, not in unwritten cultural norms that may support the same goals. \\"Montesquieu believed the hard architecture of political institutions might be enough to constrain overreaching power -- that constitutional design was not unlike an engineering problem,\\" as Levitsky and Ziblatt put it. Climate, culture, and society The third major contribution of The Spirit of the Laws was to the field of political sociology, which Montesquieu is often credited with more or less inventing. The bulk of the treatise, in fact, concerns how geography and climate interact with particular cultures to produce the spirit of a people. This spirit, in turn, inclines that people toward certain sorts of political and social institutions, and away from others. Later writers often caricatured Montesquieu's theory by suggesting that he claimed to explain legal variation simply by the distance of a community from the equator. While the analysis in The Spirit of the Laws is much more subtle than these later writers perceive, many of his specific claims lack rigour to modern readers. Nevertheless, his approach to politics from a naturalistic or scientific point of view proved very influential, directly or indirectly inspiring modern fields of political science, sociology, and anthropology.

This was six years before the final abolition of slavery in New York state (gradual abolition brought it to an end in 1827, but young people born to slave mothers had to serve apprenticeships to age 21.) The African Grove Theatre was attended by \\"all types of black New Yorkers -- free and slave, middle-class and working-class\\" along with others. It was the first place where Ira Aldridge, who would later become an esteemed and renowned Shakespearian actor, first saw a production of a Shakespeare play. Background For some years, the African Company--the company of the African Grove--played classics and many other plays with an entirely black cast and crew to mostly black audiences. It was the third of at least four attempts to create a black theater in the city, and the most commercially successful.Lott, Eric. Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class, New York: Oxford University Press, 1993, p. 44\\\\. . At one point the theatre had to build an extra level of seats to house white audiences that wanted to see the performances. After a few years, city officials shut down the African Grove, because of complaints about conduct: conduct that was normal among working- class white New York theatre audiences of the time was considered unacceptably boisterous when displayed by blacks. It is thought that the real reason was because this black theatre was becoming as successful as many other venues. One source says that the theatre was \\"mysteriously burned to the ground in 1826\\".\\"Black Theatre Program\\" , California State University, Dominguez Hills, Accessed August 14, 2005 \\"There are no records of the African Grove Theater after 1823.\\"Gonzalez, Anita & Granick, Ian. \\"Web Lecture #2: African Grove Theater\\", African American Performance. Accessed December 6, 2005. The theatre was founded by William Alexander Brown, a pioneering actor and playwright from the West Indies. He had worked as a ship's stewards at times. Through his work as a ship's steward, he traveled to England and the Caribbean, so he had a broader opportunity to see theatre than the typical New Yorker. The West- Indies-born Brown left a job on a Liverpool ship and bought a house in New York, at 38 Thomas Street. At the start, Brown held performances of the African Grove in his back yard, where he offered food and drink, but also poetry and short drama pieces. At the suggestion of James Hewlett, both an entertainer and a regular customer, together they hired other black actors. The theater's repertoire drew heavily on Shakespeare, with comic entr'actes. White audience members were confined to a separate section because, in the words of the theater's management, \\"whites do not know how to conduct themselves at entertainments for ladies and gentlemen of color.\\" The most popular plays were Richard III and Othello. James Hewlett was the first black man of record to play the leading role in Othello.Gary Jay Williams, \\"Review of Errol Hill, 'Shakespeare in Sable: A History of Black Shakespearean Actors'\\", Shakespeare Quarterly, 1986, accessed October 15, 2010. As was common at the time, the producers adapted Shakespeare's plays. Small casts and smaller budgets required expedients such as that described by the reviewer George Odell, writing of an 1821 performance of Richard III: \\"A dapper, wooly haired waiter at the City Hotel personated the royal Plantagenet in robes made up from discarded merino curtains of the ballroom. Owing to the smallness of the company King Henry and the Duchess were played by one person, and Lady Anne and Catesby by another. Lady Anne, in Act III, sang quite incongruously.\\"Odell, George. National Advocate, September 21, 1821, cited by Gonzalez & Granick. The scholar Laura V. Blanchard identifies Odell's \\"dapper waiter\\" as the actor James Hewlett. Frequently harassed by the police, and facing increasing hostility from the white populace, the company moved several times, from Thomas Street north to Bleecker and Mercer Streets. At the time this was the edge of the developed parts of New York City. When Brown moved his theatre from 38 Thomas Street to Bleecker and Mercer Streets, he had a dilemma. Realizing that his theatre now was located too far from its core audience (\\"free persons of color\\"), he constructed a theatre building which was near an oft-patroned white theater called the Park Theatre. When the Park Theatre--New York City's leading theater of the time-- put on Richard III starring the English tragedian Junius Brutus Booth, the African Company rented a hall next door for its own production of the same play the same night. Theatrical competition was stiff; Stephen Price, owner of the Park, orchestrated (and paid for) a disturbance over the rival productions so that the police would shut down the African Grove. In addition to Shakespeare, the African Company performed original works, which included William A. Brown's now-lost play, The Drama of King Shotaway. It was about a 1795 Black Carib revolt against British Navy forces on the island of Saint Vincent.Laura V. Blanchard, \\"Review of Carlyle Brown's 'The African Company Presents Richard III'\\" , Richard III Society, December 1995. Accessed August 14, 2005/October 13, 2010. Produced by the African Company in 1823, Drama is believed to have been the first full-length play by a black American performed in the United States. Despite the frequent changes in location and its short period of productions, the African Grove Theatre was important as a venue for noted African-American actors, such as James Hewlett.

He was Archbishop of San Francisco from 1977 to 1995 and Archbishop of Oklahoma City (and Bishop of the predecessor Diocese) from 1971 to 1977. He served as the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops from 1977 to 1980. Early life and ordination Quinn was born in Riverside, California, and ordained to the priesthood for the Diocese of San Diego on July 19, 1953. Pope Paul VI named him auxiliary bishop of San Diego with the titular see of Thisiduo on October 21, 1967. He was consecrated on December 12. He became a regular contributor to America. Arch/Bishop of Oklahoma City On November 17, 1971, he was appointed Bishop of Oklahoma City-Tulsa. When the diocese was split to form the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa on December 13, 1972, Quinn became the first Archbishop of Oklahoma City. The website of that Archdiocese reports that \\"he revealed his priorities by his actions: emphasis on priestly vocations, desire for better pastoral care of Spanish-speaking Catholics, re-establishment of a Catholic newspaper, appointment of a full-time youth director, and a reorganization of Catholic charities.\\" Pope Paul VI named Quinn to participate in the 1974 World Synod of Bishops. Archbishop of San Francisco Quinn's was a popular appointment by Pope Paul VI in 1977 and for almost his entire episcopate in San Francisco he enjoyed the support of priests and the lay faithful. In the early years of his time as Archbishop he was simultaneously president of the USCC NCCB, which often kept him away from the archdiocese. Quinn recognized that the Archdiocese was too large for effective pastoral governance and helped devise plans for the creation of the Diocese of San Jose, which was erected by Pope John Paul II on January 27, 1981.https://www.dsj.org/about-us/history/ Views =Irenicism and liberalism= Quinn was an irenic and liberal presence in San Francisco who, in the 1970s and 1980s, offering national leadership to Catholics in the United States on issues as diverse as U.S. women religious, the moral permissibility of nuclear weapons, sanctuary for Central American refugees, and working to overturn Roe vs Wade and restore legal protection to unborn children. =√ìscar Romero= After the assassination of Archbishop √ìscar Romero in March 1980, Quinn issued a statement lauding the murdered prelate as \\"a voice for the poor and the oppressed.\\" Quinn later attended Archbishop Romero's funeral in San Salvador. =AIDS= In 1985, Archbishop Quinn initiated the Catholic Church's first institutional response to the AIDS epidemic and when John Paul II visited San Francisco in 1987, Archbishop Quinn arranged that he met with several AIDS patients, including a young boy. =LGBT= Quinn reached out to gay Catholic as early as 1983. He issued a document that asked priests to take concerns of gay people seriously. In it, he said he wanted gay Catholics to find \\"a church where he or she will find acceptance, understanding, and love.\\" Priests were reminded in the letter that many gay Catholics saw their orientation as a positive. He supported the efforts of Most Holy Redeemer Church in The Castro in their efforts to reach out to the LGBT population of the neighborhood. Quinn regularly visited this parish, especially during the annual 40 Hours Vigil held throughout the 1980s in support of those who were HIV-positive and their caregivers. =Loma Prieta earthquake= In the 1990s, Quinn turned his attention to the needs of the archdiocese after the Loma Prieta earthquake, which damaged many churches. The Archdiocese of San Francisco drew up a plan which would see the closure of a dozen parishes whose churches had been damaged in the earthquake. This plan drew the wrath of many priests, 41 of whom signed a petition to Quinn dissenting from his plan. Quinn sold the former archiepiscopal residence and in the summer of 1992 moved into the Cathedral rectory where he lived with his fellow clergy until his retirement.  The Reform of the Papacy  Throughout his episcopate he maintained strong links with the Catholic Church in England visiting it regularly and maintaining strong personal links with the country. After his retirement from the full-time ministry he spent time at Campion Hall, Oxford where in 1996 he gave a celebrated paper on \\"The Claims of the Primacy and the Costly Call to Unity\\", a paper which was a first draft of his 1999 book The Reform of the Papacy. This call for the reform of the Roman Curia and a concomitant reduction in the power of that Curia has been interpreted by some conservative voices in the Church as an 'attack' on the papacy. Quinn repeatedly made it clear that he was not opposing the Vatican and in many ways his writings prefigured the views of Pope Francis.

The Camondo family was a prominent European family of Jewish financiers and philanthropists. History Family tree Part of the Sephardic community in Spain, the Camondo family settled in Venice after the 1492 Spanish decree that ordered the expulsion of all Jews who refused conversion to Catholicism. There, some of its members became famous for their scholarship and for the services which they rendered to their adopted country. Following the Austrian takeover of Venice in 1798, members of the Camondo family established themselves in Istanbul. Despite the many restrictions and sumptuary laws imposed on non-Muslims, the family flourished as merchants in the business section at Galata on the outskirts of the city. They branched into finance in 1802 with the founding of their own bank, Isaac Camondo & Cie. On Isaac's death in 1832, his brother Abraham Salomon Camondo inherited the bank. He prospered greatly and became the prime banker to the Ottoman Empire until the founding of the Imperial Ottoman Bank in 1863. In 1866, the year Venice became part of Italy after a peace treaty ended the Austro-Prussian War, Abraham Salomon Camondo's son Rapha√´l died. In 1869, the eighty-six-year-old patriarch followed his grandsons Behor Abraham Camondo (1829‚Äì1889) and Nissim Camondo (1830‚Äì1889) to Paris, France, a city the family had previously frequented and where they had established business connections. In recognition of his contributions and financial assistance to the liberation of Venetia from the Austrian Empire, Abraham Salomon Camondo was created a hereditary count in 1870 by King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy. Abraham died three years later in Paris, but in accordance with his wishes, his remains were returned to Istanbul for burial there in the Jewish cemetery at Hask√∂y, a neighbourhood on the Golden Horn in Istanbul. His two grandsons remained in Paris and continued to successfully expand their banking business. This family is now extinct after the last descendants died: Nissim de Camondo was killed in aerial combat during World War I in 1917, his father Mo√Øse de Camondo died in 1935, then his sister B√©atrice de Camondo, along with her two children (Fanny and Bertrand) and her ex-husband L√©on Reinach, were deported and murdered in Auschwitz around 1944 during World War II.

It was published on November 21, 1787 under the pseudonym Publius, the name under which all The Federalist papers were published. Federalist No. 9 is titled \\"The Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection\\".The U.S Constitution and Other Writings, Canterbury Classics, page 96 The same subject is continued in the subsequent paper by James Madison, Federalist No. 10. Similar to Federalist No. 51, this paper emphasizes the importance of establishing a system of checks and balances in order to ensure that the government is intact and operating smoothly. Publius' argument A major aspect of Federalist No. 9 is Hamilton's response to the common Anti-Federalist argument based on the theories of Montesquieu, who wrote famously in his The Spirit of the Laws that \\"it is natural to a republic to have only a small territory, otherwise it cannot long subsist.\\" The Anti-Federalist took his arguments to mean that the federal Union was bound to fail. Hamilton responded that if Montesquieu were taken literally, then since he was thinking of dimensions far smaller even than those of the states, the Americans would have to split themselves into \\"an infinity of little, jealous, clashing tumultuous commonwealths.\\"The U.S Constitution and Other Writings, Canterbury Classics, page 98 Of the many different Federalist Papers, this one was perhaps one of the ones that faced the most opposition, mostly because of the vagueness and non-specific sentiment that was involved with it. More seriously, Hamilton contends that the confederated federal system described in the proposed Constitution would not suffer as Montesquieu predicted because of its de-centralized design. He further argues that Montesquieu himself proposed a confederation of republics as the solution.

Feral was always the ticking time bomb of X-Force especially when it came to teammate Siryn, barely capable of controlling her deadly temper. Prior to joining the group, it was later revealed that Maria and her sister Lucia (who later became known as Thornn) had to leave home and lived with the Morlocks. It was later discovered that both girls had been abused by their cocaine addict stepfather; in retaliation, Feral killed the man and shoved his body into the wall. Her mother, who was also addicted to cocaine, found out and sought vengeance on the girl by killing all of her pet pigeons. This infuriated Feral to the point where she also killed her mother in a fit of rage. It was also hinted that she purposely pushed their younger sister down the stairs, leading to her death, as well as allowed their younger brother to fall to his death from their roof. Ultimately, Feral betrayed X-Force and became the enemy of her former teammates when she was convinced to join the terrorist group known as the Mutant Liberation Front,X-Force #28. Marvel Comics. although her alliances would continue to shift. After a brief stint with the MLF, Feral emerged from hiding when the New York City police captured Thornn. Thornn revealed that she had seen Feral kill Harry Bellinger, their mother's boyfriend. Cannonball provoked Feral into admitting that she had murdered her mother. Cannonball overpowered Feral, and an old friend of Lucia's, police detective Jose Hidalgo, arrested her for killing three members of her family and Bellinger. During her jail time, Feral discovered she was infected with the Legacy Virus. She was either unable to be convicted or escaped, as she was next seen trying to obtain Isotope E (along with other virus sufferers) as a possible cure from the High Evolutionary. X-Force #90 where Feral injures Siryn Feral, now mentally distraught from her illness later resurfaced with a new incarnation of the Hellions led by King Bedlam. Although the team's criminal activities were limited to stealing the Armageddon Man to use him as a weapon, Feral left her mark. All of the rage that she had felt for Siryn in the past boiled over in an argument where Feral sliced through Siryn's vocal cords, incapacitating her powers. After being cured from the virus, Feral apparently had a change of heart. She, as well as her sister Thornn, were recruited to be members of the Mumbai branch of the X-Corporation along with her former teammate Warpath and Sunfire. The team helped save Professor X from an assassination attempt by a crazed Lilandra Neramani, who still believed that Charles Xavier was Cassandra Nova.New X-Men #133. Marvel Comics. She stayed with X-Corp for quite some time, but she returned to New York after M-Day, where the Scarlet Witch caused the mutant gene to disappear from 90-95% of the mutant population worldwide, making them \\"baseline humans\\". Both Feral and her sister were depowered and in Mutant Town, looking for answers. They both traveled to Wakanda where both sisters met up with other feral heroes such as Sasquatch and Wolfsbane. As a group, the four of them were to aid Wolverine in his search for his longtime foe Sabretooth. During the group's investigation to find Sabretooth, both Feral and Thornn are kidnapped by the enigmatic geneticist Romulus, a 2,000 year old mutant. Romulus specializes in feral mutations preferring wolf-based entities such as individuals like Wolfsbane. Despite Feral and Thornn's cat- like exteriors, the girls are put under extreme experiments that changed them on the genetic level. The sisters woke up and found that they were in a Weapon X experiment facility, and remembered nothing of the events that brought them there. Though not feeling any different except for their slight amnesia, they were more than surprised when they got up and looked at each other, the sisters realize that their bodies had been tampered with as they only saw their once mutant forms; cat-like in appearance. Whatever had been done to them had, in their beliefs, reversed their depowering and they were both mutants again. =Fighting Sabretooth= Their memories however, began to slowly come back when Wolverine appeared. He was surprised to see their visages but gladly accepted the additional power that their mutant forms carried, should they wish to continue. Feral chose to proceed, ecstatic in the chance to use her powers again. Now that Wolverine had finally found and secured the sisters he could continue his search for Sabretooth. The two continued to search the facility they were in. With so many hallways and doors they inadvertently got separated. While alone, Feral stumbled upon Sabretooth. He was very different, more animalistic, even more so then normal. Confident in her skills, she willingly confronted him. In such close quarters and Sabretooth in his apparently mindless state, she found the truth about her powers far too late. Sabretooth killed her. Wolverine arrived right after Sabretooth killed her. Wolverine V3 #54 though he later killed Sabretooth by beheading him.Loeb, Jeph. Wolverine #54. Marvel Comics. In the end, the team regrouped. With Feral dead, it was then speculated by Wolfsbane that the sisters were still baseline humans. Only their outward appearances had been changed back to their once feline forms. Wolverine agreed, as it explained why she lost so easily. It appeared that Romulus only reverted their physical forms back to their previous mutant forms without actually granting them their mutant powers. Feral's life came full circle; she was murdered in cold blood by a feral mutant in a berserker state as she in a similar state did to much of her family in her youth. Despite the fact that she had lost her powers prior to her death, Feral was resurrected and repowered by means of the Transmode Virus to serve as part of Selene's army of deceased mutants. Under the control of Selene and Eli Bard, she took part in the assault on the mutant nation of Utopia and was seen attacking X-23 and Dr. James Bradley.X-Force (3rd Series) #21 (January 2010).

Feral's attack fails as she passes through Wolfsbane's body, and Rahne reminds her that Feral is dead. Feral does not believe it but feels something is wrong about herself, and vanishes when she realizes that she is dead. She later materializes, with her memories intact in the taxi Rahne and Shatterstar are riding, as they are being chased by their enemies. She reveals that there are many supernatural entities, specifically animal-type gods with dog and cat forms, now after Rahne's hybrid unborn baby. They are using Maria's spirit as a homing beacon on Rahne as she was once part of the human world when she was still alive, with the promise that they will reward her service to them by fully resurrecting her.X-Factor (3rd series) #221 (Aug 2011).

Feral was depowered during M-Day. She was repowered when she was briefly resurrected during Necrosha. Feral was a fierce hand-to-hand combatant, trained in unarmed combat by Cable.

In 1832, he inherited a banking business and a fortune from his brother Isaac (who had died without children), and he was able to expand it greatly during his life, partly through real-estate investment. Camondo lived in the Galata district with his wife Clara, whom he had married on 25 May 1804, and their son Raphael (1810-1866). While Venice was under Austrian rule, he received as an Austrian subject the title of Knight of the Order of Franz Joseph, and in 1854, as the representative of the Austrian community of Constantinople, he and his family went to Vienna to attend the wedding of Emperor Franz Joseph. From his ancestors, who had settled in the Veneto, he had a cultural affinity with Italy and on 18 November 1865, he and all members of his family obtained Italian nationality.Nadine Gasc and G√©rard Mabille, The Nissim de Camondo Museum (Paris: Fondation Paribas, n.d.), p. 10. When Venice again became an Italian possession, Camondo, as a Venetian citizen, presented large gifts to several Italian philanthropic institutions, in recognition of which King Victor Emmanuel conferred upon him the title of count on 28 April 1867, with the privilege of transmitting it in perpetuity to the eldest son of the family. Count Camondo exercised substantial influence with the sultans Abd√ºlmecid I and Abd√ºlaziz, and over the Ottoman grand viziers and ministers. He was banker to the Ottoman government before the founding of the Ottoman Bank. He obtained from the Porte a firman extending the privilege of possessing real estate in the empire, which until then had been restricted to subjects of the Ottoman Empire, to foreign nationals. Camondo was active in behalf of other Jews. He established in Constantinople a central consistory for the Jews of the empire, of which he was almost continuously the president; he introduced reforms into the communal administration; and he founded in 1858 an educational institution, the Institution Camondo, at Peri Pasha, the poorest and most densely populated suburb of the capital. Shops for tailoring and shoemaking were soon added. On account of this school its benevolent founder was excommunicated by certain fanatical rabbis, and he endured otherwise much vexation; yet it flourished for thirty-two years and trained the majority of the Jewish officials then in the service of the Ottoman government. Dying in Paris at the age of 88, where he had relocated by 1869, le comte de Camondo (as he was known in France), according to his last wishes, was buried in his family vault in the Jewish cemetery in Hask√∂y, Constantinople. His funeral took place on 14 April 1873, and the Ottoman government held memorial services in his honor.

At the end of 2011, there were more than 10,000 outlets of the chain in 32 countries. Early life Rosenberg was born in Boston, Massachusetts, one of four children of Nathan Rosenberg, a grocery owner, and Phoebe Rosenberg (n√©e Swart). Both parents were Jewish-German immigrants from Prussia. Rosenberg grew up in Boston's working-class Dorchester neighborhood and was educated in public schools. Due to financial problems, he was forced to leave school by eighth grade to help support his family, who had lost their store during the Great Depression.  Career  After several jobs, at age fourteen, he went to work for Western Union as a full-time telegram delivery boy. At seventeen, he started working for Simco, a company that distributed ice cream from refrigerated trucks, rising from delivery boy to national sales manager at age twenty-one, supervising the production, shipping, cold storage and manufacturing and managing 40 to 100 trucks. At the start of World War II, he joined Bethlehem Steel in Hingham, Massachusetts. He later became the first Jewish trade union delegate. After the war, Rosenberg borrowed $1,000 to add to his $1,500 in war bonds and used his knowledge of food distribution to open his first company \\"Industrial Luncheon Services\\", a company that delivered meals and coffee break snacks to factory workers on the outskirts of Boston. Rosenberg created his own catering vehicles, with sides that rose to reveal sandwiches and snacks stocked on stainless steel shelves, an early predecessor to mobile catering vehicle. Within a short time, he had 200 catering trucks, 25 in-plant outlets and a vending operation. Noticing that forty percent of his revenues came from coffee and doughnuts, he started a retail shop that specialized in those products, opening his first coffee and doughnut shop, the \\"Open Kettle\\" on Memorial Day in 1948, later renamed \\"Dunkin' Donuts\\". Instead of the five different types of doughnuts doughnut shops traditionally offered, Rosenberg offered 52 different varieties. In 1955, upon opening his sixth shop, he decided on the concept of franchising his business as a means of distribution and expansion. In 1959, after the franchise idea had started to catch on, he lobbied at a trade show for the creation of the industry group that became the International Franchise Association in 1960. In 1968, Rosenberg bought Wilrose Farm in rural East Kingston, New Hampshire. After being diagnosed with lung cancer in 1971, he devoted his time to the farm, becoming the largest standardbred breeder in New England and was inducted into the New England Hall of Fame of the Standardbred Industry. In 1980, he donated Wilrose Farm to the University of New Hampshire, and later became involved in philanthropy, primarily benefiting hospitals. In 2001, he published his autobiography, Time to Make the Donuts: The Founder of Dunkin Donuts Shares an American Journey, written with the help of Jessica Brilliant Keener.

It is also the name of a ward of the Adelaide Hills Council, and a suburb, both named after the residence and in which the residence is located. It is about east of Adelaide between the towns of Ashton and Cherryville, and has expansive views of the Adelaide Hills to the North and East, and the Adelaide Plains to the West. The residence was destroyed during the Black Sunday bushfire of 1955. Subsequently, the site was managed by the National Trust of South Australia from 1967 to 1992, and the Department for Environment and Heritage from 1992 to 2009. A volunteer Friends of Parks group, Friends of Marble Hill, ran open days and maintained the site from 1994 to 2008. To date, the main building has never been fully restored, but the National Trust undertook restoration of the tower and the nearby stables in the 1970s. Successive State Governments have not been prepared to restore the building (despite it having been a residence of the vice-regal representative), as the expense involved would not be considered responsible use of public funds. In 2009, Marble Hill was sold to a local family, who plan to reconstruct and re-use the building. History The locality of Marble Hill was not greatly developed until after the establishment of the Vice-Regal Summer Residence. It consisted largely of uncleared pastoral land until 1880. This was partly due to the rugged terrain dissuading settlers, but also due to the fact that the Government did not offer a large amount of the land for sale. A large area was declared a Government Reserve in 1878, the year that construction on the residence commenced. It was around that time that Governor William Jervois was said to have given the hill its name. When informed that marble had been found during the excavation of the site, he remarked \\"Then we shall call it Marble Hill\\". In fact, there is no true marble at Marble Hill. The Governor's informant had merely misidentified the locally abundant quartzite. An alternative account contends that it was instead named for the hill's rounded top, which supposedly resembled a marble when viewed from a distance. In 1896, part of the Government Reserve was subdivided into 34 blocks of approximately each which were offered for lease. The \\"blockers\\", as those who took up residence on the blocks became known, found it difficult to make a living on the uncleared land in the early years, but by the 1920s, all of the blocks were tenanted and productive, planted mainly with fruit trees. Prior to the establishment of the Government Reserve, part of the locality was used as a pound for stray animals. Demographics Although a gazetted locality, Marble Hill is too small to have its own postcode. In the , Marble Hill was included within the postal area of the neighboring town of Ashton (5137). At that time, there were 427 persons resident in the area (52.6% male and 47.4% female), living in 165 occupied dwellings. 100% of the dwellings were separate houses. The median age was 40 years. Unemployment was 3%, and median weekly household income was $1366. 38.2% of dwellings were owned outright, with 12.7% rented at a median weekly rent of $200. For the 2011 census, a suburban boundary realignment saw Marble Hill moved to the postal area of Basket Range (5138). In that year, there were 374 residents in the area (53.7% male and 46.3% female), living in 134 occupied dwellings, 100% of which were separate houses. The median age was 44. Unemployment was 5.5%, and median weekly household income was $1704. 47.8% of dwellings were owned outright, with 16.4% rented at a median weekly rent of $250. The 2016 census used gazetted suburb and locality boundaries. Marble Hill on its own had a population of 67 people in 24 dwellings. Vice-Regal summer residence Vice-Regal residence from the south showing some of the gardens, circa 1900. The first Vice-Regal country residence was built at Government Farm, Belair in 1860. Although well- appointed for its time, it was a relatively modest structure, and several governors found it too small for their purposes. When Governor William Jervois arrived in 1877, he very soon proposed the construction of a new and grander building. He was instrumental in securing government expenditure, and also personally oversaw the selection of a site and directed the design process. The first stone was laid on 18 July 1878, and the structure was completed and furnished in late 1879. A budget overrun led the Hon. G. C. Hawker (the Commissioner of Public Works) to invite South Australian Parliamentarians to see the completed structure in December 1879. Seeing the magnificence of the building, they were convinced that the money had been well spent. The designing architect was William McMinn, and was supervised by government Architect-in-Chief E. J. Woods with James Shaw supervisor of works. McMinn's design was of the Victorian Gothic Revival style, adapted for Australian conditions by the addition of large verandahs on three sides which shielded the structure from the fierce northern sun. His original design was for 40 rooms, although only 26 were ever completed, with the western aspect of the building left for possible later addition. The main eastern rooms included a drawing room, a morning room, a dining room and a spacious staircase of kauri pine and blackwood. There was no large ballroom, and the dining hall was not grand ‚Äì it was a residence intended to be primarily a retreat from the summer heat of the Adelaide plains, rather than a primary place of residence with all the accompanying facilities for entertainment. The sandstone used for construction was sourced from local quarries. Stables and caretaker's cottage were built a short distance to the west. =Governors in residence= Governor William Jervois was responsible for the decision to build Marble Hill All fifteen governors who held office from 1880 to 1955 spent at least some time at Marble Hill. In addition, a number of distinguished guests were welcomed throughout the house's 75-year history as a viceregal residence, particularly King George V and Queen Mary (as Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York) who stayed in 1901. Many governors also welcomed local children and other such groups on tours from time to time. *1880‚Äì1883: William Jervois ‚Äì From his earliest days of residence, Jervois was very friendly with the locals, and keenly assisted with fundraising for church and district projects. *1883‚Äì1889: William Robinson ‚Äì Sir William found the isolation of Marble Hill lonely, and had no sooner arrived there than he was wanting to be elsewhere, such as Glenelg or some other seaside resort. *1889‚Äì1895: Algernon Keith-Falconer ‚Äì Lord and Lady Kintore made regular visits during their tenure, and had the gardens laid out. *1895‚Äì1899: Thomas Buxton ‚Äì Buxton notably held a garden party at the residence for over 100 delegates of the Federal Convention, during their meeting in Adelaide during April 1897. *1899‚Äì1902: Hallam Tennyson ‚Äì Sir Hallam and Lady Audrey Tennyson were particularly fond of Marble Hill, despite having to contend with heat, drought and bushfires during their stays.

In early 1916, he offered Marble Hill for use as a military hospital, in response to a request from the military authorities for a building \\"a considerable distance from the nearest hotel\\". However, the authorities decided that the building was too isolated. *1920‚Äì1922: Archibald Weigall ‚Äì Governor Weigall was a keen cricketer, and during his residence held an annual match between the Viceregal party and locals at the nearby Ashton Oval. *1922‚Äì1927: Tom Bridges ‚Äì Governor Bridges occupied Marble Hill only for the occasional weekend, prompting the government to consider selling the residence, as it was costing ¬£328 per annum to run it. Some of the suggested uses for the building included a boarding house, hostel, flats or consumptive sanitorium. *1928‚Äì1934: Alexander Hore-Ruthven ‚Äì Marble Hill continued to fall from favour under Governor Hore-Ruthven, who indicated in 1932 that he would be willing to forgo the use of Marble Hill under his contract (a possibility the Government had been investigating since 1928). However, the remoteness of Marble Hill had made it difficult to retain staff or to easily convert to a government institution, and so the status quo prevailed. *1934‚Äì1939: Winston Dugan ‚Äì A number of modifications were made to the residence and outbuildings during 1939, among them the addition of several bathrooms and the conversion of the coach-house into a garage for motorcars. *1939‚Äì1944: Malcolm Barclay-Harvey ‚Äì During the years of the Second World War, Sir Malcolm and Lady Muriel Barclay- Harvey spent time at Marble Hill whenever they were able to take a break from supporting the war effort. They restored the beautiful gardens, and Sir Malcolm (an avid railway enthusiast) had an outdoor model railway installed. Lady Muriel also named one of her racehorses \\"Marble Hill\\" after the residence. *1944‚Äì1952: Willoughby Norrie ‚Äì Governor Norrie and his family took up residence at Marble Hill as soon as they arrived in Adelaide toward the end of 1944, and lived there every subsequent summer of his governorship. Lady Norrie hosted Lady Baden-Powell in her capacity as World Chief Guide at Marble Hill during her 1948 trip to Australia, *1952‚Äì1955: Robert George ‚Äì In 1954 the Government commenced renovation of both viceregal residences. The original acetylene gas lighting at Marble Hill was replaced, at considerable expense, with electricity. Sir Robert and Lady George's possessions were moved to Marble Hill while Government House was being renovated. Marble Hill was to have been renovated the following year. =Bushfires= Marble Hill's location at the peak of a steep, densely wooded ridge meant that bushfires were a regular threat. *1882 ‚Äì On 8 February, only two years after being completed, Marble Hill was first threatened by a bushfire. The fire broke out in a gully to the east of the residence during the afternoon, possibly due to careless cooking by locals. Swift action by the police and residents contained the fire, but it continued to burn along the gully until the evening of the 9th. The garden and some of the fences were damaged. *1901 ‚Äì The intense heat and drought of the summer of 1901 resulted in a number of bushfires while Sir Hallam and Lady Tennyson were in residence. Lady Tennyson wrote that the bushfires, with their billowing smoke and glowing hilltops by night, were a remarkable sight. The gardens and part of the orchard were damaged in the fire. *1910 ‚Äì On Sunday 20 February, bushfires that had been menacing the Mt Lofty Ranges around Norton Summit began to threaten Marble Hill. The Governor in residence, Admiral Bosanquet, directed firefighters and local volunteers in the burning of firebreaks, but it was a tense night for those guarding the residence. On Monday, a change in the wind brought the fires rapidly upon them. The Register reported that \\"big trees were as matches before the advancing fire.\\" The full force of the firefighters was mustered, which enabled the residence to escape damage, although the Government Domain was largely burnt. *1912 ‚Äì Admiral Bosanquet had to defend the residence a second time. Early on 14 January, a fire broke out at Morialta on the property of the late Sir Richard Baker. It soon became apparent that the westerly wind would drive the fire toward Marble Hill. When the fire was at its height, the English cricket team and Lord Richard Nevill arrived, having been invited for lunch. They had to dash through the flames to reach the residence, and were able to render most timely assistance. The servant's quarters, the caretaker's cottage, the stables and even the kitchen of Marble Hill itself were all ignited, but fortunately these conflagrations were all noticed and quickly extinguished. The gardens, however, were destroyed. *1930 ‚Äì Around of stringybark forest adjoining the house were destroyed on 18 February. The Governor and staff managed to subdue the fire when it was halfway up the drive. *1939 ‚Äì Marble Hill was again threatened by the Black Friday fires of 1939. *1955 ‚Äì The Black Sunday bushfires destroyed Marble Hill on 2 January. *2000 ‚Äì On 16 December, a prescribed burn conducted by CFS below Marble Hill jumped containment lines and turned into a major firefighting operation.http://www.abc.net.au/news/video/2009/10/23/2722925.htm Major bushfire managementhttp://www.abc.net.au/stateline/sa/content/2003/s994869.htm A call for action as South Australia faces its most dangerous bushfire season in years =Destruction= On 2 January 1955, fifteen people were in residence at Marble Hill, including Sir Robert and Lady George, their family, staff and servants. The bushfire conditions were extreme, with a temperature of as early as 7am. By 1pm, the temperature had risen to , and winds of up to were driving a bushfire that had broken out at nearby Anstey's Hill towards Marble Hill. With little warning, the strong winds drove the fire up the slope to the northwest of the house, and flames licked the building. The bitumen product used on the balcony floor and the seaweed used for insulation in the roof were easily ignited, and the house was soon on fire. The Governor with his sons and staff struggled to save the building, but the buckets and hoses which had been prepared were totally inadequate. The building was engulfed by flame with astonishing speed. By this time the bushfire had completely surrounded the residence, the cars which had been prepared as a last-resort were burning, and molten lead was showering down from the roof. Escape was impossible. At the prompting of Sir Robert, the fifteen people at Marble Hill dashed out of the house for the relative safety of a retaining wall by the driveway, sheltering under wet blankets. The fire swept over them and totally destroyed the house. After around two hours, rescuers were able to reach them and the party were transported to Adelaide, where they were treated for some minor injuries. Later, it was discovered that a servant's cat had also survived by sheltering in the cellar.Cooper, Ashley, \\"Marble Hill: South Australian Vice Regal Summer Residence 1879‚Äì1955\\", National Trust of Australia, 1973 Sir Robert and Lady George lost all their possessions in the fire, as they had been transferred to Marble Hill whilst Government House was undergoing restoration following damage suffered in the earthquake of 1954. Marble Hill had been slated for renovation after Government House, but the house's destruction led to the Government re-evaluating its plans for the building. =Ruin= Ruins of Marble Hill in 2008 from the former bushfire lookout tower. Because of the prohibitive cost of reconstruction, in September 1955 the Government of South Australia announced it would not rebuild Marble Hill. Additional damage was done when the government demolished some areas of the building considered to be \\"unsafe\\" a few days after the fire. In 1967, the property was dedicated to the National Trust of South Australia as a public reserve, although visitors were still barred from the structure itself. In 1973, restoration work was commenced on the stables, the coach house, and the coachman's cottage. The chief stonemason and supervisor was Mr Ted Eling. The National Trust reopened Marble Hill as a ruin in 1975. In 1979, the tower reconstruction was completed. In 1980, Marble Hill was listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. South Australian Heritage Register ‚Äì Marble Hill During the 1980s, the Country Fire Service used the tower as a bushfire lookout. In 1992, the National Trust closed the site to the public due to insufficient funding, and the site reverted to the administration of the Department of Environment and Heritage (DEH). The following year, the Government called for expressions of interest in the development and management of the site. Mayor of East Torrens, Isabel Bishop, called for the building to be restored and used as a \\"VIP status hotel\\". In 1994, the volunteer group \\"Friends of Marble Hill\\" was formed in order to facilitate public access, open days and functions, while DEH retained responsibility for maintenance and funding, and the National Parks and Wildlife Service provided vegetation and land-care services.Parliament of South Australia, Hansard, House of Assembly, Friday 19 November 1999, pp. 611 Four years later, in 1998, DEH commissioned a Conservation and Dilapidation Report which investigated the structural integrity of the ruins and the possibility of reconstruction. In 2009, a group called Encompass Technology wrote to the Governor of South Australia supposedly on behalf of the Kaurna people, asserting sovereignty over the Marble Hill ruins, and the Warriparinga Living Kaurna Cultural Centre in Marion, and claiming that they were owed nearly $50 million in rent. The South Australian Government subsequently rejected the claim. =Reconstruction= In March 2007, the State Government of South Australia again called for expressions of interest in the future development and management of the Marble Hill site. Twelve interested parties sought information, and one proposal was received. In October 2009, the property was sold to Mr. Edwin Michell and Dr. Patricia Bishop, a local couple. Michell has a private investment company and Bishop is a sister of Federal M.P. Julie Bishop and has been involved in restoration of several historic Adelaide Hills properties.\\"Rising from the Ashes\\" Independent Weekly 23 ‚Äì 29 May 2008 p.6 Among the conditions of a heritage agreement attached to the certificate of title are that the ruin will be reconstructed in consultation with a heritage architect, and that public open days will continue.Tim Lloyd Marble Hill being restored to its glory days The Advertiser (SA Weekend), 24 January 2015. Retrieved 2 January 2020. The work is being undertaken with a strong focus on local suppliers and the revival of artisan trades, under the supervision of builder Andrew Green. The first phase of reconstruction was completed in December 2015, with the installation of a copper-roofed tower lantern. The project is expected to be complete by early 2019.

Nearly fifty years later, investigators concluded that the light was a meteor and the creature was a barn owl perched in a tree, with shadows making it appear to be a large humanoid.  History  At 7:15 p.m. on September 12, 1952, two brothers, Edward and Fred May, and their friend Tommy Hyer said they saw a bright object cross the sky and land on the property of local farmer G. Bailey Fisher. The boys went to the home of Kathleen May, where they told their story. May, accompanied by the three boys, local children Neil Nunley and Ronnie Shaver, and West Virginia National Guardsman Eugene Lemon, went to the Fisher farm in an effort to locate whatever it was that the boys said they had seen. The group reached the top of a hill, where Nunley said they saw a pulsing red light. Lemon said he aimed a flashlight in that direction and momentarily saw a tall \\"man-like figure with a round, red face surrounded by a pointed, hood-like shape\\". The Flatwoods Monster has frequently been sighted in Cabell County. When asked, \\"Why Cabell County?\\" The monster responds, \\"My heart has always been at the Traveler's Motel.\\" Descriptions varied. In an article for Fate Magazine based on his tape-recorded interviews, UFO writer Gray Barker described the figure as approximately tall, with a round blood-red face, a large pointed \\"hood-like shape\\" around the face, eye-like shapes which emitted greenish-orange light, and a dark black or green body. Kathleen May described the figure as having \\"small, claw-like hands\\", clothing-like folds, and \\"a head that resembled the ace of spades\\". According to the story, when the figure made a hissing sound and \\"glided toward the group\\", Lemon screamed and dropped his flashlight, causing the group to run away. September 14, 1952 news clip from the Charleston Daily Mail The group said they had smelled a \\"pungent mist\\" and some later said they were nauseated. The local sheriff and a deputy had been investigating reports of a crashed aircraft in the area. They searched the site of the reported monster but \\"saw, heard and smelled nothing\\". According to Barker's account, the next day, A. Lee Stewart, Jr. of the Braxton Democrat claimed to discover \\"skid marks\\" in the field and an \\"odd, gummy deposit\\" which were subsequently attributed by UFO enthusiast groups as evidence of a \\"saucer\\" landing. According to former news editor Holt Byrne, \\"newspaper stories were carried throughout the country, radio broadcasts were carried on large networks, and hundreds of phone calls were received from all parts of the country\\". The national press services rated the story \\"#11 for the year\\". A minister from Brooklyn came to question the May family. A Pittsburgh paper sent a special reporter. UFO and Fortean writers like Gray Barker and Ivan T. Sanderson arrived to investigate.  Conventional explanations  A barn owl, seen with \\"claw-like hands\\" and a face shaped \\"like the ace of spades\\" After investigating the case in 2000, Joe Nickell of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry concluded that the bright light in the sky reported by the witnesses on September 12 was most likely a meteor, that the pulsating red light was likely an aircraft navigation/hazard beacon, and that the creature described by witnesses closely resembled an owl. Nickell suggested that witnesses' perceptions were distorted by their heightened state of anxiety. Nickell's conclusions are shared by a number of other investigators, including those of the Air Force. The night of the September 12 sighting, a meteor had been observed across three states‚ÄîMaryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. According to Nickell, three flashing red aircraft beacons were also visible from the area of the sightings, which could account for descriptions of a pulsating red light and red tint on the face of the supposed monster. Nickell concluded that the shape, movement, and sounds reported by witnesses were also consistent with the silhouette, flight pattern, and call of a startled barn owl perched on a tree limb, leading researchers to conclude that foliage beneath the owl may have created the illusion of the lower portions of the creature (described as being a pleated green skirt). Researchers also concluded that the witnesses' inability to agree on whether the creature had arms, combined with Kathleen May's report of it having \\"small, claw-like hands\\" which \\"extended in front of it\\", also matched the description of a barn owl with its talons gripping a tree branch. According to skeptic Ryan Haupt, even though local boy Max Lockard admitted he'd driven around the site \\"hoping to see something\\" in his Chevy truck, \\"paranormal investigators concluded that the tracks, oily residue, and bits of a rubbery substance must have been left by the creature and not the truck\\". Haupt explains nausea reported by some of the witnesses as symptoms \\"consistent with hysteria and over-exertion\\". Local culture The Flatwoods monster chair welcomes visitors near the town hall. Local officials have erected a \\"Welcome to Flatwoods / Home of the Green Monster\\" sign on the route leading into the town. In celebration of the legend, the Braxton County Convention and Visitor's Bureau built a series of five tall chairs in the shape of the monster to serve as landmarks and visitor attractions. The town of Flatwoods also houses a museum dedicated to the monster legend and offers promotional merchandise. The Bureau rewards visitors who photograph all five chairs with \\"Free Braxie\\" stickers as part of their ongoing promotion. The monster legend is celebrated every year when the town of Flatwoods holds its annual festival called \\"Flatwoods Days\\". The three-day festival is a weekend of live music, and food and craft vendors. In popular culture * The monster appears in various video games, such as The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, Space Harrier II, Amagon, Strikers 1945, and Fallout 76. * The second episode of the 2019 History Channel television series Project Blue Book is entitled \\"The Flatwoods Monster\\", and is based on the Flatwoods incident.

It is 60 km south of Bathurst or about 16 km south-east of Mandurama. It is 940 metres above sea level and has a population of about 100. History European settlement of the area began soon after the establishment of Bathurst in 1815, but the exact time is still unclear. The village was known by different names before it was finally called Neville in 1888. Other names previous to Neville include \\"No-one swamp\\" or \\"Number one Swamp\\" (the creek that it is on) and Macquarie in reference to Lachlan Macquarie, an early governor of New South Wales, and then \\"Mount Macquarie\\" which the nearby Mount Macquarie is still called. Another possibility is that Neville was a stagecoach stop on the direct road from Rockley to Cowra. The modern city of Cowra was built in a region previously called \\"The Lachlan\\". The road joining Rockley to \\"The Lachlan\\" was called \\"The Old Lachlan Road\\". Fragments of the \\"Old Lachlan Road\\" still exist near Rockley, north of Hobbys Yards, south of Woodstock and in Neville. Features Several of the old buildings were erected during the time Neville was called Mount Macquarie, such as the school built in 1858 which is still used today. Several churches were built during the late 19th century. The Uniting church still conducts several services each year and the tiny Presbyterian church is available for special occasions. The other remaining church - the former Church of England church has been converted into a house. A public hall was built in 1890, and is still used for public and private functions today, and sometime later a Federal Store. There is a hotel, which was built in 1929 after the original Neville Hotel was destroyed in a fire. Many homes within the town date back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Neville today The Valley Store of H.H.May, once an agent for Palings Music & Pianos, Yates seeds and Clyde Engineering products for farming (1880s) is now the Golden Era Piano Museum. Neville Siding was established in 1987 by Ted and Betty Wilson to provide an accommodation facility for visitors. The railway line through Blayney makes possible visitation to the area and roads link the village to major centres such as the historic towns of Carcoar and Cowra to the south. Neville can be reached by travelling the difficult road from Carcoar over Mount Macquarie which is partially surrounded by the Neville State Pine Forest. Neville is picturesque from the top of this mountain with forest creeping to its peak and a snow- covered outlook at times during the winter.

The stadium was inaugurated on October 12, 1916 when Santos beat Clube Atl√©tico Ypiranga 2‚Äì1, with Adolfo Millon Jr. scoring the first goal of the stadium. It was named in honor of Urbano Caldeira, former player, manager and chairman of Santos, in 1933. The stadium, given the nickname Vila Belmiro due to its location within the Vila Belmiro neighborhood, has been Santos' permanent residence since 1916. However, the team sometimes uses the Pacaembu Stadium located in the city of S√£o Paulo for important games due to the low capacity of Vila Belmiro. The stadium underwent several expansions and renovations in the 1990s and 2000s (decade), most notably the renewal of the irrigation and drainage systems, flood-lighting and the replacement of the field. The stadium's current highest attendance was recorded in 1964, when 32,989 spectators watched the Campeonato Paulista match between Santos and Corinthians. Location The Est√°dio Urbano Caldeira is located on the Princesa Isabel street, in the neighborhood of Vila Belmiro, occupying the block bounded by the streets of Tiradentes, Don Pedro I, and Jos√© de Alencar. The venue is 600 feet (182.88 meters) in between the avenues of Senator Pinheiro Machado and Dr. Bernadino de Campos. History Soon after its foundation, Santos held their training in a field located in the neighborhood of Macuco. As the field did not meet the minimum size standards to host official matches, Santos played on the \\"Igreja Cora√ß√£o de Maria\\" pitch in Ana Costa Avenue. The field, however, was also used by other clubs in town. In 1915, the situation reached its breaking point, when Santos had constant conflicts with other city clubs on when the field could be used, forcing the club to reject several requests for international friendlies. To solve the problem, the leaders began searching for land in the city, with a commission formed by Luiz Suplicy J√∫nior, Harold Cross, Sebasti√£o Arantes Nogueira and Francisco Viriato Corr√™a da Costa. On May 31, 1916, a general assembly approved the purchase of an area of 16,500 square meters, in the neighborhood of Vila Belmiro, approved by club president Agnello C√≠cero de Oliveira and vice-president Dr. √Ålvaro Ribeiro. The land acquired belonged to Companhia de Habita√ß√µes Econ√¥micas, and the field was bought from them at a price of Rs$66,660,000. The board members obtained a 10-year loan which was liquified in 1923 after paying Rs$35,000,000 in interest fees. Est√°dio Urbano Caldeira during its inauguration The club, however, did not obtain a nearby area belonging to Benefic√™ncia Portuguesa, since the club's finances did not favor this. It would not be acquired until 1989. The original date for the inauguration of the field was August 20; it was postponed until further notice due to the death of Dr. √Ålvaro Ribeiro. On October 12 of that year, the inauguration of the Vila Belmiro sports park was celebrated with several ceremonies among the members, including a march by musical corporation Humanit√°ria, to see off playing on Macuco field. The first game was held 10 days later at 13:30 (UTC-3), against Ypiranga for the 1916 Campeonato Paulista, the competition's 491st match, which Santos won 2‚Äì1. Ticket prices were set at Rs$2 for bleacher and Rs$1 for the general public. Adolfo Millon Jr. scored the first ever goal on that stadium with Jarbas scoring the second, while Boror√≥ scored for the visiting team. Santos was formed by: Odorico; Am√©rico and Arantes; Pereira, Oscar and Junqueira; Millon, Marba, Tedesco, Jarbas and Arnaldo. Ypiranga was represented by Dion√≠sio; Dario and Ferreira; Loschiavo, Jacintho and Peres II; Ary, Hugo, Boror√≥, Peres I and Formiga. Demosthenes de Silos was the referee for the match. =Early years= Santos' first match during the night took place on March 21, 1931 The first major renovation occurred in 1931. On March 21, of that year, the stadium renovated its stands and an illumination system was installed. Twenty hours later, the club's first late match was played against a combined team from the city of Santos, with the club losing to its city counterpart 0‚Äì1. Manoel Cruz, a midfielder from Portuguesa Santista, scored the only goal of the match. After Urbano Caldeira died on March 12, 1933, Ricardo Pinto de Oliveira, one of the club board members at that time, wanted to pay homage to Caldeira by naming the stadium after him. After a meeting which included all club members, the naming of the stadium was given a positive vote. Twenty-two years later, the first concrete stand was built where the current electrical score‚Äìkeeping screen is located at. Called A Vila Mais Famosa do Mundo (The World's Most Famous Village), the Est√°dio Urbano Caldeira also came to be called after the era of Os Sant√°sticos (1956‚Äì1973) the \\"Al√ßap√£o da Vila (The Village Trap) because opposing team often left the ground defeated. Due to the proximity of the stands with the field where the matches unfolds, the pressure that the fans have on opposing teams was said to be incredible. After the golden age, the Vila Belmiro became synonymous with Joga Bonito. The first concrete stand was built in 1955. In that stadium of modest dimensions, stars of past and present such Pel√©, Coutinho, Pepe, Giovanni, Pitta, Robinho, Diego, Neymar and Paulo Henrique Ganso became figures for the national team. For many years Vila Belmiro was the place where Pel√© demonstrated his skills. On November 21, 1964, at Vila Belmiro, Pel√© scored eight goals against Botafogo (SP), when Santos beat the opposing squad 11‚Äì0. On October 2, 1974, Pel√© played his farewell game at the stadium. In that match, Santos beat Ponte Preta 2‚Äì0. The stadium's attendance record currently stands at 32,989, set on September 20, 1964 when Santos and Corinthians drew 0‚Äì0. However, the record was overshadowed by a tragic event, as part of the stadium bleachers collapsed, resulting in injury to 181 spectators. The match was abandoned and rescheduled 10 days later, in the Pacaembu. =Development= During the 1996 Campeonato Paulista, the stadium was closed because the field was in a poor condition. During this time Santos FC played in many stadiums, including the Est√°dio Bruno Jos√© Daniel in Santo Andr√© and the Pacaembu Stadium in S√£o Paulo. After that, the stadium was modified to adopt a system of drainage and irrigation systems controlled by computer. On July 20, 1997, Santos inaugurated the new stadium bleachers, located behind the goal net where, today, the visiting fans are located at. On January 27, 1998, during a game between Santos FC and Delia Tavano, a new illumination system was used, with level of 1,200 lux, more than the FIFA minimum recommendation. Est√°dio Urbano Caldeira hosted a charity match in 2003. On November 17, 2003, Santos FC opened the Memorial das Conquistas, a place inside the stadium as the club memorial, containing trophies, medals, documents, shirts, posters, movies and many other items that recount the club's history. Visitors can also enter the team clock room, press room and the pitch, and, at the end of a tour, can buy club products in a club store inside the stadium. In 2009, the new electronic scoreboard was purchased, twice the size of the previous panel, and provides the score of the game, shows materials, promotions and news of Santos. In addition, the stadium has acquired new seats. More than five thousand seats were installed to better serve members of the club. The seats have been approved by FIFA and were imported from Europe. The Vila Belmiro was one of the venues of the 1949 Copa Am√©rica, hosted the 1962 Copa Libertadores final and the 1998 Copa CONMEBOL final. It has also hosted a Copa do Brasil final in 2010. Due to its relative- low capacity, Santos has used other stadiums for high-profile matches such as the Est√°dio Palestra It√°lia, Pacaembu and Morumbi, all located in S√£o Paulo, and the Maracan√£ in Rio de Janeiro. Current Santos President Lu√≠s √Ålvaro Ribeiro and other club directors are agreeing on building a stadium in a city nearby Santos called Cubat√£o, a stadium for 40,000 people which would become Santos' home field for almost 70% of the games during the season which would increase the team's profit. Memorial das Conquistas Several trophies won by Santos FC at the Memorial das Conquistas Santos built a space to receive visitors and tourists interested in knowing the history and achievements of the club in 2003. Named the Memorial das Conquistas, it is one of the main attractions of the Est√°dio Urbano Caldeira, inaugurated by Pel√©, Cabralzinho and Marcelo Texeira. The museum's collection is distributed over an area of 380 square meters. In addition to trophies, there are life-size photos, banners, documents, uniforms, balls, and other multimedia objects. Visitors are greeted by bilingual guides, available to answer queries regarding the club's history and exhibits at the museum. The material is divided into thematic areas. Beyond Espa√ßo Pel√© (personal collection with pieces from O Rei),Various from many of his biographies, See for example 3rd section, last line: \\" 'The King' was given to Pel√© by the French press in 1961 after he played a few matches with SFC in Europe\\" Or the already quote Or the book \\"Pele, King of Soccer/Pele, El rey del futbol ‚Äì Monica Brown (Author) & Rudy Gutierrez (Illustrator) Rayo Publishing December 2008 \\" there is the location of state and national titles, information about the city, Santos and the World, among others. The museum also innovates by presenting various multimedia equipment such as TV sets, which allow viewing of historical plays. The CineGol is a site, which reproduces a piece of football field in a projection room that lets you view movies and special clips about the club. Since its inauguration, it has received over 300,000 visitors. 1949 South American Championship One match of the 1949 South American Championship was played at the Est√°dio Urbano Caldeira: See also * List of football stadiums in Brazil * CT Rei Pel√© * CT Meninos da Vila * Arena Santos References Further reading        External links  *Est√°dio Urbano Caldeira at www.santosfc.com.br *Est√°dio Urbano Caldeira image *Stadium pictures at StadiumDB.com Estadio Urbano Caldeira Category:Football venues in S√£o Paulo (state) Category:Sports venues completed in 1916 Category:Sports venues in S√£o Paulo (state) Category:1916 establishments in Brazil ","title":"Est√°dio Urbano Caldeira"},{"id":"2449915","text":"2008 Summer Olympics Torch in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong. Protest of Civil Human Rights Front. jailed Hong Kong pro-democracy leaders, 20 August 2017 Human rights protection is enshrined in the Basic Law and its Bill of Rights Ordinance (Cap.383). By virtue of the Bill of Rights Ordinance and Basic Law Article 39, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is put into effect in Hong Kong. Any legislation that is inconsistent with the Basic Law can be set aside by the courts. In general, Hong Kong is perceived to enjoy a high level of civil liberties. The Hong Kong government generally respects the human rights of the citizens, although many core issues remain. There are concerns over the freedoms to the people which is restricted by the Public Order Ordinance and the national security law. The police has been occasionally accused of using heavy-handed tactics towards protestors and questions are asked towards the extensive powers of the police. As to the right of privacy, covert surveillance remains the major concern. There is a lack of protection for homosexuals due to the absence of a sexual orientation discrimination law. There are also comments regarding a lack of protection for labour rights. Human rights in Hong Kong occasionally comes under the spotlight of the international community because of its world city status. This is occasionally used as a yardstick by commentators to judge whether the People's Republic of China has kept its end of the bargain of the \\"One Country, Two Systems\\" principle granted to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by its current mini-constitution, the Basic Law, under the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Alleged human rights violations are sometimes used by skeptics to argue that the ‚ÄúOne Country, Two Systems‚Äù policy is a failure. Protection Framework =Sino-British Joint Declaration= Under the Annex I (Section XI) of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, it stated that: > The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government shall protect the > rights and freedoms of inhabitants and other persons in the Hong Kong > Special Administrative Region according to law. The Hong Kong Special > Administrative Region Government shall maintain the rights and freedoms as > provided for by the laws previously in force in Hong Kong, including freedom > of the person, of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, to form > and join trade unions, of correspondence, of travel, of movement, of strike, > of demonstration, of choice of occupation, of academic research, of belief, > inviolability of the home, the freedom to marry and the right to raise a > family freely. =The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region= Under the Basic Law, the constitutional documents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, certain rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents (including both permanent residents and non-permanent residents) are guaranteed and safeguarded in Chapter III of the law. These rights and freedoms include: *equality before the law; *permanent residents' right to vote and to stand for election in accordance with law; *freedom of speech, of the press and of publication; *freedom of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration; *freedom to form and join trade unions, and to strike; *the right from arbitrary or unlawful arrest, detention and imprisonment; *the right from torture and unlawful deprivation of the life; *the right from arbitrary or unlawful search of, or intrusion into resident's home or other premises; *freedom and privacy of communication; *freedom of movement within Hong Kong, of emigration to other countries or regions, and freedom to enter or leave Hong Kong; *freedom of conscience; *freedom of religious belief and to preach and to conduct and participate in religious activities in public; *freedom of choice of occupation; *freedom to engage academic research, literary and artistic creation, and other cultural activities; *the right to confidential legal advice, access to the courts, choices of lawyers for timely protection of their lawful rights and interests or for representation in the courts, and to judicial remedies; *the right to institute legal proceedings in the courts against the acts of the executive authorities and their personnel; *the right to social welfare in accordance with law; *freedom of marriage and the right to raise a family freely; and *other rights and freedoms safeguarded by the laws of Hong Kong SAR. Article 39 also expressly states that the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and international labour conventions as applied to Hong Kong shall remain in force in Hong Kong to the extent that they shall not contravene the provisions of the rights protected by the Basic Law. Although these rights are explicitly vested in Hong Kong residents, non- residents in Hong Kong may also enjoy these rights and freedoms in accordance with law by Article 41. In addition, Article 87 protects and preserves the rights previously enjoyed by parties to any criminal or civil proceedings, especially the right to fair trial by the courts without delay and the presumption of innocence until convicted by the courts. Article 105 protects the rights of property and the right to compensation for lawful deprivation of property of individuals and legal persons. =Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance= The Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (Cap. 383)(the \\"Bill of Rights\\"), enacted in 1991, is the local adaptation of the provisions of the ICCPR as applied in Hong Kong. The Bill of Rights has largely been recognised by the courts as one of the constitutional documents alongside with the Basic Law. However, the fact that the Bill of Rights was enacted in the form of an Ordinance (as a local primary legislation) means that the Legislature can amend or repeal the Bill of Rights by an ordinary enactment through ordinary legislative procedure, subject to judicial review. Furthermore, if any part of the Bill of Rights is held unconstitutional (i.e. any part contravenes the Basic Law), the courts are bound to strike down that part. After the transfer of sovereignty, certain provisions of the Bill of Rights ceased to have effect, including sections 2(3) (duty to have regard to purpose of Ordinance in interpretation), 3(1) (duty to construe pre-existing legislation consistently with the Ordinance), 3(2) (pre-existing legislation that cannot be construed consistently is repealed) and 4 (all future to be construed so as to be consistent with the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong). However, due to the entrenchment of the ICCPR as applied in Hong Kong in Article 39 of the Basic Law, the significance of the Bill of Rights Ordinance, which was modelled after the ICCPR, has been reinstated. Some Basic Law rights overlap with the rights protected by the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance to certain extents while the provisions in the Bill of Rights and in the ICCPR are not identical. As a result, a right can be protected by either the Basic Law, the Bill of Rights, or the ICCPR as applied in Hong Kong at the same time. =Common Law= Before the enactment of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, the protection of human rights in Hong Kong has largely relied on the common law of England. Civil liberties protection have a long history in English common law and are generally transcribed as human rights in modern time. Under Articles 8 and 18 of the Basic Law, the laws previously in force in Hong Kong includes the common law rules which did not contravene the Basic Law and are part of the laws of HKSAR. Since colonial Hong Kong law defines \\"common law\\" as \\"the common law of England\\", Section 3 of the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance, dated 30 June 1997 civil rights principles found in the English law are now part of Hong Kong laws as \\"laws previously in force in Hong Kong\\" by operation of Articles 8 and 18 and as \\"common law in force in Hong Kong\\" pursuant to section 3 of the current Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 1). Those common law principles include those of statutory interpretation, such as the presumption that statutes do not operate retroactively (also codified in the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance), the doctrine that criminal enactments are to be strictly interpreted, the presumption that mens rea is required in a criminal offence, and the presumptions against a derogation of vested rights, ousting the court's jurisdiction, deprivations of private property without compensation and the presumption that the Legislature does not intend to legislate contrarty to the State's international obligation.Johannes Chan and C.L. Lim, \\"Interpreting Constitutional Rights and Permissible Restrictions\\", Law of the Hong Kong Constitution (2nd Edition), 2015, Chapter 14, p.567 By virtue of Article 81 of the Basic Law, the Hong Kong SAR also inherits a common law jurisdiction which emphasises on due procedure, nature justice, fair trial without delay, the presumption of innocence, the right of silence, the right of bail, the right against double jeopardy, the right against self-incrimination, and the duty to exercise a statutory power fairly.ibid These subjects matter often found in judicial review proceedings in Hong Kong, a significant and noticeable feature of human rights protection framework in Hong Kong. =Judicial Review= Article 11 of the Basic Law provides that \\"no law enacted by the Legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall contravene this Law.\\" This Article has the effect that any Ordinance that contravenes the Basic Law shall be null and void. Hence, any legislation that contravenes Article 39 of the Basic Law, which entrenches the ICCPR, is also null and void. It is well established that the Hong Kong Courts can now conduct the Marbury v. Madison type of judicial review to review the legislative and executive acts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. This power exists before the handover since Hong Kong was governed by the Letters Patent, as opposed to Britain which has an unwritten constitution and where Parliament is sovereign. In the landmark case of Ng Ka Ling and Others v. Director of Immigration, Chief Justice Andrew Li declared in emphatic terms: The approach of the courts towards the review of the constitutionality of legislation was laid down in R v. Sin Yau Ming, which adopted the Canadian approach in R. v. Oakes. Once there is a prima facie violation of a protected right, the government bears the burden of justifying the breach by showing: # The impugned provisions pursue a sufficiently important objective which is related to pressing and substantial concerns in a free and democratic society # There is a rational connection between the objective and the means chosen # The means adopted causes minimal impairment to the right of freedom in question # The effects on the limitation of rights and freedoms are proportional to the objective However, controversies exist over whether the courts have the power to conduct a constitutional review of a legislative act of the National People's Congress or its Standing Committee. The Court of Final Appeal stated in Ng Ka Ling that the courts do have such a power. However, this declaration provoked heavy criticisms from the mainland authorities and developed into a constitutional crisis. Civil and political rights under domestic law =Right to life= The right to life is protected under Article 28 of the Basic Law and Article 2 of the Bill of Rights. In practice, the right to life is mainly protected by the criminal law (murder and manslaughter). No capital punishment has been carried out since 1966 and it has been formally abolished for all crimes in 1993. ( even though Hong Kong was handed back to China ). =Freedom of expression= The freedom of expression is protected under Article 27 of the Basic Law and Article 16 of the Bill of Rights. It is regarded as a fundamental right, but the Bill of Rights (and hence the ICCPR) provides that restrictions to it are justifiable provided that the restrictions are provided by law and are necessary for respect of the rights or reputations of others; or for the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals. During a demonstration on 1 January 1998, civil activists Ng Kung Siu and Lee Kin Yun extensively defaced the National and Regional Flags. Certain portions were cut out or torn, black ink was daubed over the flags, black crosses were drawn, and the word \\"shame\\" was written on the flags. The two were charged under section 7 of the National Flag Ordinance and section 7 of the Regional Flag Ordinance, which provide that a person who desecrates the national or regional flags commits an offence. The constitutionality of section 7 of the National Flag Ordinance and section 7 of the Regional Flag Ordinance were challenged by the defendants. The defendants were convicted before the magistrate, and were bound over to keep the peace on his own recognisance of $2,000 for 12 months for each offence. The Court of Appeal quashed their convictions. The Court of Final Appeal unanimously held that the provisions were justified and not unconstitutional, as they merely ban the mode of expressing one's message but do not interfere with the person's freedom to express the same message in other ways. The convictions and the binding over ordered by the Magistrate were restored. The decision was heavily criticised by Raymond Wacks in his article \\"Our Flagging Rights\\" in Hong Kong Law Journal. The Edison Chen photo scandal brought people to harbour doubts about the Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance, which criminalizes the distribution of obscene articles and the distribution of indecent articles without proper warnings to persons under 18. On 2 February 2008, Commissioner of Police Tang King Shing warned that sharing the photos via email, and even storing them on a personal computer, might be illegal, even if there was no record of distribution. This inaccurate statement of the law led to the objection of Leung Kwok-hung, who accused the police of sowing confusion and creating an atmosphere of \\"white terror\\" among netizens. Leung urged Commissioner Tang to clarify whether merely keeping the pictures violated the law. The police later amended Mr. Tang's statement, saying that looking at the photos or emailing them between mutual friends isn't against the law, although posting them to Web sites is. The police's exuberance and inconsistency in cracking down on naked photos of celebrities triggered a public backlash from some netizens, who feel the police was curbing their freedom of expression in order to serve the powerful. The public reaction caused the government to table a review and public consultation of the Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance. Another incident that concerned the freedom of expression in Hong Kong is the Citizens' Radio incident, in which several civil activists were charged for operating a radio station without a license granted by the Chief Executive in Council, contrary to section 8 and 20 of the Telecommunications Ordinance. Constitutional challenge of the licensing regime was unsuccessful. According to section 4 of the Places of Public Entertainment Ordinance (Cap. 172), no person shall keep or use any place of public entertainment without a licence granted under section 10 of the Ordinance. On 30 May 2010, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China exhibited a replica of the Goddess of Democracy statue in Times Square in the absence of a license in order to commemorate the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. It was confiscated by the police and after the ensuring scuffle two senior members of the Alliance were arrested for obstruction of a police officer in the due execution of his duty. Secretary for Food and Health York Chow Yat-ngok rebuffed claims of political oppression by saying the authority was merely enforcing the law after receiving complaints. Despite the incidents mentioned above, Hong Kong is generally considered to enjoy a high degree of freedom of expression, with Freedom House commenting that it is a right that is \\"generally respected in practice, and political debate is vigorous\\". =Freedom of assembly= The freedom of assembly is protected under Article 27 of the Basic Law and Article 17 of the Bill of Rights. Article 17 of the Bill of Rights provides: alt=Police officers were maintaining order in a large-scale protest in Hong Kong Although there are no official figures in the number of protests, an analysis of newspaper reports has shown that the reported number of protests increased from under 100 before 2000 to 210 in 2004, and stayed at aroundo 200 cases up to 2006, signalling the maturation of civil society. It has also been argued that the 1 July march in 2003, in which half-a-million residents took to the streets to protest the proposed national security bill and express strong general dissatisfaction with the government, halted the legislation of the proposed bill and allowed civil society to recognise its strength and potential in the policy-making process. The 1 July march is organised every year. On 10 August 2020, the Hong Kong Police arrested billionaire businessman Jimmy Lai for allegedly collaborating with foreign forces. The police raided Jimmy‚Äôs newspaper office. He is a prominent pro-government protestor. This is considered as the most high-profile arrest since the implementation of national security law. In February 2020, Jimmy was arrested on illegal assembly charges, but released on bail. Chinese state media, Global Times, reported that Jimmy Lai‚Äôs sons and two senior executives of Next Digital had also been arrested. Statutory restriction framework This fundamental right is mainly restricted by the Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245). *A public procession consisting of more than 30 persons can only take place if the Police Commissioner has been notified a week in advance and the Commissioner has notified the organiser that he has no objection.s.13(2), Public Order Ordinance (Cap.245) *The Commissioner can object to the public procession, but only if he reasonably considers that the objection is necessary in the interests of national security or public safety, public order or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.s. 14(1), Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245) *The Commissioner may, where he reasonably considers it necessary in the interests of national security or public safety, public order or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, impose conditions in respect of any public procession notified under section 13A, and notice of any condition so imposed shall be given in writing to the organiser and shall state the reasons why such condition is considered necessary.s.15(2), Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245) *Further requirements include the presence of the organiser at the procession, maintenance of good order and public safety, the prohibition of unreasonable use of amplification devices, compliance with directions given by a police officer for ensuring compliance with the Commissioner's requirements and the Ordinance's requirements etc.s.15(1), s.15(4), Public Order Ordinance (Cap.245) On the other hand, certain statutory safeguards are present in the Ordinance. *The Commissioner can accept the notice that is given in less than a week. If he decides not to, he must inform the organizers in writing as soon as possible and give reasons.s.13A(2), Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245) *The Commissioner can only reject an application if he considers objection is necessary for the statutory legitimate purposes. It is to be noted the \\"protection of public health & morals\\" purpose in the Bill of Rights is absent in the Ordinance, hence restricting the Commissioner's discretion.s.14(1), Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245) *The objection must be given as soon as possible and within the statutory time limit.s.14(2), Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245) *The Commissioner is obliged not to object if he reasonably considers that the relevant statutory legitimate purposes could be met by imposing conditions.s.14(5), Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245) *The Commissioner's discretion may only be delegated to police officers of inspector or above.s.52, Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245) *A decision by the Commissioner can be appealed to an Appeal Board. The decision of the Appeal Board can be judicially reviewed (but not appealed).s.16, Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245) Constitutionality of the statutory framework On 10 February 2002, a number of persons gathered at Chater Garden for a procession. Civil activist Leung Kwok-hung was the organizer of the procession but did not notify the Commissioner in advance. A police officer invited him to go through the statutory notification procedure, but Leung refused and was warned of the consequences. Initially, the procession consisted of 40 people, but it eventually grew to about 96 persons. They ignored police advice for several times, but the procession was at all times peaceful. Leung and two others were later charged under section 17A(3)(b)(i) of the Public Order Ordinance for holding an unauthorized assembly. They were convicted before the magistrate and were bound over on their own recognizance for $500 for a period of three months; the conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeal. At the Court of Final Appeal, the constitutionality of the entire statutory notification scheme was challenged. Chief Justice Li, Justice Chan PJ, Justice Ribeiro PJ and Sir Anthony Mason NPJ, having considered all the statutory restrictions on the freedom of assembly and the statutory safeguards listed above, held that the notification system was constitutional. However, they held that the norm of \\"ordre public\\", which existed as a statutory legitimate purpose at that time, was too vague at a statutory level and hence could not be said to be prescribed by law. \\"Ordre public\\" was as a result severed, but the term \\"public order\\" was sufficiently precise to survive. They also remarked in dicta that the norm of \\"protection of the rights and freedoms of others\\" was too wide and did not satisfy the legal certainty requirement. They affirmed the convictions as the severance did not affect the conviction. Justice Bokhary PJ dissented, noting in his judgment that the whole statutory scheme should be struck down except the entitlement to notification. Obstruction of a public place On 14 March 2002, a number of Falun Gong practitioners were engaged in a peaceful demonstration outside the main entrance to the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Their number varied from 4 to 16 over time, hence rendering the statutory restriction scheme inapplicable. It was still possible to access the Liaison Office via a vehicular driveway. After warnings were ignored by the demonstrators, the superintendent in charge ordered his officers to arrest and remove them. The demonstrators resisted arrest but were eventually forcibly removed using heavy-handed tactics and loaded on board police vehicles. When they arrived at the police station, female demonstrators refused to leave the vehicles. Police officers took action to carry them off the vehicles but the demonstrators resisted and assaulted the officers. thumb The demonstrators were charged with obstruction of public place. The Court of Final Appeal, constituted by the same judges in Leung Kwok-hung and Others v. HKSAR, allowed the appeal from the defendants and quashed all convictions. The court stressed that any physical obstruction of a public place must be accompanied by the element of \\"without a lawful excuse\\" in order to constitute an offence. If a person is merely using public place reasonably, they cannot be said to be acting without lawful excuse. When obstruction results from a peaceful demonstration, the constitutionally protected right is introduced into the equation for reasonableness. The court concluded the demonstrators were acting with reasonable excuse and acquitted them with regard to the offense of obstruction of public place. =Freedom of religion= The freedom of religion is protected by Article 32 of the Basic Law and Article 15 of the Bill of Rights. The practice of Falun Gong is legal and tolerated in Hong Kong. However, in 2003 Falun Gong protestors were charged with obstruction of a public place after a peaceful demonstration outside the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. They were initially convicted before the magistrate, but were eventually acquitted of all charges by the Court of Final Appeal. Furthermore, the HKSAR government was repeatedly accused of refusing entry to Falun Gong practitioners for allegedly political reasons. On the other hand, the Hong Kong Police arrested two men and charged them with criminal damage when they attacked a Falun Gong promotional stand in Mong Kok. The Anglican and Roman Catholic churches in Hong Kong freely appoint their own bishops, unlike in mainland China. Cardinal Joseph Zen, the immediate past Bishop of Hong Kong, was outspoken about religious freedom and human rights in China. =Right to equality= The right to equality is protected by Article 25 of the Basic Law and Article 22 of the Bill of Rights. A number of Ordinances have been enacted in order to give horizontal effect to the equality provisions in the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights. Examples include the Sex Discrimination Ordinance, the Disability Discrimination Ordinance, the Family Status Discrimination Ordinance and the Race Discrimination Ordinance. The Equal Opportunities Commission is a statutory body set up to implement these legislations and eliminate discrimination. The Race Discrimination Ordinance sparked fierce debates in Hong Kong because the definition of race as \\"race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin of the person\\" left Mainland Chinese immigrants unprotected. It was remarked by the Court that not all differential treatments constitute discrimination. If the differential treatment pursues a legitimate aim, is rationally connected to the legitimate aim and is no more than necessary to accomplish the aim, the differential treatment is justified and does not constitute discrimination. Only when the differential treatment is unjustified will it be deemed as discrimination. Sexual orientation Gay sex was legalised in Hong Kong in 1991. However, the Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200) shows a tendency to discriminate against the gay community by stipulating different ages of consent for homosexual and heterosexual relations, and has been challenged for a number of times. In Secretary for Justice v. Yau Yuk Lung Zigo, the constitutionality of section 118F(1) of the Crimes Ordinance was challenged. The section provides that it is an offence for a man to commit buggery with another man otherwise in private. The Court of Final Appeal unanimously held that the section was discriminatory as it constitute unnecessary differential treatment on the ground of sexual orientation. All persons, irrespective of sexual orientation, are subject to the common law offence of committing an act outraging public decency. In Leung TC William Roy v Secretary for Justice, the constitutionality of section 118C of the Crimes Ordinance, which provides that a man who commits or suffers to commit buggery with a man under the age of 21 is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life, was challenged. The provision was held to be unconstitutional as while the age of consent for heterosexual couples is 16, male homosexual couples must reach 21 to have sex legally. Despite fierce opposition from church groups, on 16 December 2009, Hong Kong's Legislative Council passed a bill extending its Domestic Violence Ordinance to apply to same-sex couples. Despite the above victories of the homosexual community, same-sex marriage is not recognised in Hong Kong. There is also an absence of anti-discrimination legislation to create horizontal effect for the protection of homosexuals in human rights instruments, leaving homosexuals with no legal redress if discriminated against for their sexuality by private individuals. Indigenous people Hong Kong, despite being highly westernised, still retains Chinese culture and traditions, especially in the Region's New Territories. Such traditions are expressly protected in Article 40 of the Basic Law, which provides that the lawful traditional rights and interests of the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories shall be protected. In Secretary for Justice and others v. Chan Wah and Others, the second respondent complained of having been excluded by electoral arrangements from standing as a candidate in village elections on the ground he was not indigenous, although he had lived there all his life. It was held that as the village representative would represent the whole village, not just indigenous persons, the restriction was not reasonable and electoral arrangements were held unconstitutional accordingly. The Hong Kong Government introduced the Small House Policy in 1972, which is an attempt to regularise village traditions. It allows indigenous male adult villagers, who is descended through the male line from a resident in 1898 of a recognised village, to be granted a plot of land at reduced premium in order to build a small house of specified dimensions within the 'V' zone and the environs or the village extension area of a recognised village. There have been demands to abolish this policy due to its being perceived as discriminatory, although such attempts have been strongly refuted by the Heung Yee Kuk. Gender In Secretary for Justice and others v. Chan Wah and others, the first respondent, who was non-indigenous and male and married to an indigenous and female villager, was excluded from voting in village elections. However, the arrangements were such that a non- indigenous, female villager married to an indigenous, male villager would have qualified as an indigenous villager with a right to vote. It was held such arrangements constitute unlawful discrimination on the ground of sex. In Equal Opportunities Commission v. Director of Education, the Secondary School Place Allocation System was challenged as being discriminatory towards girls. To help boys overcome the late bloom, a scaling system was introduced whereby boys and girls scores were scaled separately. The result was that the final score of boys were boosted and those of girls reduced. Further the band cutting scores were different for each sex, with girls requiring a higher score to get into the top band. There were also gender quotas. The system was held to be unconstitutional. Protection against sexual harassment at the workplace was put in place in 1995 through the enactment of the Sex Discrimination Ordinance. There is international jurisprudence that supports a reading of the word ‚Äúsex‚Äù in the prohibition of sex discrimination to include discrimination against transgender persons. The Hong Kong government has provided public funding for the treatment of transgenderism covering counselling and, for those who proceed further, the provision of gender reassignment surgery. Post-operative transsexual persons can apply to change the gender on their identity cards and passports. However, a person's gender at law is determined by a birth certificate, which cannot be changed. In 2010, in W v Registrar of Marriages, Andrew Cheung J held that the references in the Marriage Ordinance to \\"man\\" and \\"women\\", properly interpreted, do not cover post-operative transsexual persons. It was further held that the Marriage Ordinance, which deny marriage to transsexual persons, was not inconsistent with the right to marry under the Basic Law or the Bill of Rights. Until W's appeal was allowed at the Court of Final Appeal, it was not possible for a transsexual person to marry someone of the same biological sex under Hong Kong law. On 16 September 2013 Eliana Rubashkyn a transgender woman was discriminated and sexually abused for the airport's staff, forcing international organizations like United Nations and Hong Kong NGOs to provide assistance as a refugee becoming a stateless person, she suffered for more than 9 hours invasive body search. =Legal certainty= 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests Article 39 of the Basic Law stipulates that the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents shall not be restricted \\"unless as prescribed by law\\". Sir Anthony Mason NPJ, in his judgment in the landmark case Shum Kwok Sher v. HKSAR, said, \\"International human rights jurisprudence has developed to the point that it is now widely recognised that the expression \\"prescribed by law\\", when used in a context such as art. 39 of the Basic Law, mandates the principle of legal certainty.\\" In that case, the Court of Final Appeal laid down two requirements for legal certainty: # The relevant law must be sufficiently certain and precise to enable citizens to regulate his conduct # The relevant law must be adequately accessible The Court remarked that a balance has to be struck between requiring the law to be formulated with sufficient precision and the desirability of avoiding rigidity in the law. The precision required will vary according to the context of the law; if it is impossible to formulate the law with absolute certainty, a description of the nature of the activity will provide sufficient notice. On the facts of that case, the Court held that the common law offence of misconduct in a public office was sufficiently certain. =Presumption of innocence= Article 87 of the Basic Law and Article 11 of the Bill of Rights provides that anyone charged with a criminal offence shall have the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law. This presumption is well established under the common law; the much-celebrated case of Woolmington v DPP[1935] AC 462 laid down the basic criminal law principle that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the defendant's guilt subject to the defence of insanity and statutory exceptions. If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant committed the criminal offence in question, the prosecution has not made out the case and the defendant is entitled to an acquittal. However, as mentioned above, statutes may place the burden of proof on the defendant or make presumptions of facts which require the defendant to prove otherwise. In such circumstances, the reverse burden must be justifiable to avoid being struck down as unconstitutional. According to R v. Sin Yau Ming, a statutory provision is prima facie unconstitutional if the defendant has to prove the essential elements of the offence. Moreover, the reverse burden must be justified under the Oakes test. This principle was partly affirmed by the Privy Council decision in AG v. Lee Kwong Kut[1993] 2 HKCLR 186 when Lord Woolf said: =Right to property= The right to property is protected by Article 6 of the Basic Law. Furthermore, Article 105 confers upon individuals the right to compensation for lawful deprivation of their property. Statutory protection of the right to property is found in the criminal offence of theft and in the Copyright Ordinance (Cap. 528) and the Prevention of Copyright Privacy Ordinance (Cap. 544) etc. The town planning regime had been questioned as to its compatibility with this right. Whether zoning restrictions effected by the Outline Zoning Plans constitute a deprivation of property was considered by the Court of Appeal in Fine Tower Associates Ltd v Town Planning Board. The Conditions of Exchange limited the applicant's land use to industrial and/or godown, but the Draft Outline Zoning Plan designated 44% of the land as \\"Open Space\\" and 56% as \\"Other Specified Uses\\". The Court noted that a deprivation of land could occur not only by a formal expropriation of the land but also by an act which nullified any meaningful economic benefit in the land. It was held that the applicant had not lost all meaningful or economically viable use of the land, as it could still sell the land. The Court stressed that Article 105 had to be read in conjunction with Article 7, which authorises the government to manage the land in Hong Kong.per Stock JA para 4‚Äì8, 25‚Äì27, 33 =No arbitrary arrest, detention, imprisonment, search or seizure= Arbitrary arrest, detention, imprisonment, search or seizure are prohibited under Article 28 of the Basic Law and Article 5 of the Bill of Rights. No one shall be deprived of his personal liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure established by law. In practice, this area is governed by a mixture of common law and statutes. At common law, false imprisonment is recognised as both a tort and a crime. Kidnapping is a crime at common law and is codified in section 42 of the Offence Against the Person Ordinance (Cap.212). Power of arrest It was confirmed in the case R v. To Kwan Hang & Another that the common law power of arrest is applicable to Hong Kong. Any person has the right to take reasonable steps to stop someone from \\"breaking or threatening to break the peace\\", and that \\"reasonable steps in appropriate cases will include detaining him against his will\\".R (on the application of Laporte) v. Chief Constable of Gloucestershire [2006] UKHL 55 Bokhary JA, as he then was, explained that a breach of peace occurs when a person \\"unlawfully resorts to violence which injures someone or damages property, or which puts someone in immediate danger of injury or property in immediate danger of damage\\". The general power of all persons to arrest can also be derived from statutory sources. Section 101 of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Cap.221) stipulates that any person may arrest without warrant any person whom he may reasonably suspect of being guilty of an arrestable offence. An arrestable offence in Hong Kong refers to an offence for which the sentence is fixed by law or for which a person may be sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding 12 months.s.3, Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance (Cap.1) Section 101A of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance also allows any person to use reasonable force when effecting or assisting a lawful arrest. The power of the police to arrest is much more extensive than that for citizens. They have the unqualified power to arrest pursuant to a warrant,s.53, Police Force Ordinance (Cap.232) and the police officer effecting the arrest is not responsible for any irregularities in the warrant as long as he is acting pursuant to it.s.60, Police Force Ordinance (Cap.232) A police officer can execute a warrant notwithstanding the warrant is not in his possession at the time, but the warrant shall, on the demand of the person affected, be shown to him as soon as practicable after the arrest. If no warrant is obtained, the police can only effect an arrest pursuant to section 50 of the Police Force Ordinance (Cap.232). Section 50 allows a police officer to apprehend any person who (i) he reasonably believes will be charged with or who (ii) he reasonably suspects of being guilty of any offence for which the sentence is fixed by law or for which a person may be sentenced to imprisonment or if the service of a summons is impracticable. The constitutionality of this provision was reviewed in Yeung May-wan and Others v. HKSAR. The Court held that, in order to be compatible with Article 28 of the Basic Law, the first limb must be read as encompassing the second and did not eliminate the requirement for reasonable suspicion of guilt. The suspicion of guilt must be objectively reasonable, and the facts known by the police officer must be such that, if true, they would constitute all the elements of the offence in question. On the facts of that case, it was held that the arrests were not lawful and constituted false imprisonment as the police officers did not have in mind the element of \\"without lawful excuse\\" when arresting the Falun Gong protestors for obstruction of public place. If a person is unlawfully arrested, he is entitled to use reasonable force to free himself. In the Yeung May-wan case, the defendants were therefore acquitted of wilfully obstructing a police officer and assaulting a police officer, even though there was actually a scuffle. The person arrested must be delivered immediately to a police station.s.51, Police Force Ordinance (Cap.232) The reasons for the arrest must be given to the arrested person before or at the time of the arrest.Abbassy v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1990] 1 WLR 385 Power to stop, detain and search Section 54(1) allows a police officer to stop, detain and search any person as long as he \\"acts in a suspicious manner\\". This requirement of suspicion was said to be subjective in a 1980 case. Whether this remains good law is unclear as it was decided before the coming into effect of the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights and the judgment in Yeung May-wan. On the other hand, section 54(2) requires an objective reasonable suspicion. Proof of identity alt=Refer to caption Any person aged 15 or above and is a holder of a Hong Kong Identity Card is required to have it with him at all times.s.17C(1), Immigration Ordinance (Cap.115) There is no requirement that reasonable suspicion is needed if a police officer decides to demand the production of one's Identity Card,s.17C(2), Immigration Ordinance (Cap.115) as long as the officer is in uniform or produces his appointment documentation. A police officer may arrest without warrant anyone who fails to produce his Identity Card.s.17D, Immigration Ordinance (Cap.115) Failure to produce one's Identity Card is an offence punishable by a level 2 fine.s.17C(3), Immigration Ordinance (Cap.115) During the 2019 anti-extradition law amendment protests, police officers who failed to produce identification (by removing or refusing to produce identifying documents) yet still proceeded to arrest protesters - often violently - have resulted in a large number of individuals (including many innocent bystanders) who were arrested to be left with no recourse for the injuries and alleged torture they sustained during and after the arrest. As of September 2019, there are court cases attempting to rectify this. The Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor has expressed its reservations as to the compatibility of this power with the Bill of Rights. =Right to privacy= The right to privacy is protected by Article 30 of the Basic Law and Article 14 of the Bill of Rights. At statutory level, protection is mainly offered by the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, which has quite a limited scope. It stipulates six data protection principles which must be adhered to when dealing with personal data.Schedule 1, Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) Non-compliance with the principles is not a criminal offence but the party concerned may be served with an enforcement notice by the Privacy Commissioner. Non-compliance with an enforcement notice is punishable by a penalty of a fine at Level 5 and imprisonment for 2 years.s.64(7), Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) The statute also creates a civil cause of action: an individual who suffers damage, including injured feeling, by reason of a contravention of the Ordinance in relation to his or her personal data may seek compensation from the data user concerned.s.66, Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) However, the powers of law enforcement officers to conduct covert surveillance had been largely unchecked before 2005. The legal basis for covert surveillance first came under scrutiny in two criminal cases in the District Court in 2005. To plug the loophole, the Chief Executive promulgated the Law Enforcement (Covert Surveillance Procedure) Order in August 2005. Leung Kwok-hung and Koo Sze Yiu, two political activists who claimed they had probably been targets of covert surveillance, brought an action to challenge the constitutionality of the practice of covert surveillance. They succeeded at the Court of First Instance, which held that section 33 of the Telecommunication Ordinance and the Order were both unconstitutional.Leung Kwok-hung and Another v. Chief Executive of the HKSAR HCAL No.107 of 2005 The former created the power to intercept communications without adequate safeguards against abuse. The later failed to comply with the procedural requirement in the Basic Law. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal and the Court of Final Appeal. The Court of Final Appeal suspended for six months the declaration of invalidity of the unconstitutional provisions, so that new legislation can be introduced to regulate covert surveillance. The Interception of Communications and Surveillance Ordinance (Cap. 589) was passed by the Legislative Council on 6 August 2006 after a 58-hour debate. The law enforcement agencies have since been heavily criticised by the Honourable Mr Justice Woo V-P, the Commissioner on Interception of Communications and Surveillance. He remarked that some law enforcement officers were dishonest and unwilling to cooperate, behaved in an arrogant and presumptuous manner that was bordering on recalcitrance, and disobeyed orders by deleting relevant recordings of covert surveillance. It was also revealed that the government relied on a Canadian precedent to question the Commissioner's power to access covert surveillance recordings, and that a legislative amendment may be required to clarify the situation. An outrage was caused when it was revealed ICAC officers spent four days tapping a man's phone line although their target was a supposed to be female. Also revealed were four cases of unauthorised ICAC tapping of phone conversations between lawyers and their clients in 2007. In 2010, it was reported that the police might have conducted covert surveillance over the phone conversations of participants of the anti-express rail demonstrations. When a district councillor questioned Police Commissioner Tang King Shing regarding the incident, Tang did not respond to the question directly, choosing to reply that the police acts according to law and adopts a stringent management of all covert surveillance operations. =Right to vote= The right to vote is protected under Article 26 of the Basic Law. Previously, there was a general automatic and indiscriminate restrictions on prisoners' right to vote. A case was brought by two men, Chan Kin-sum and Choi Chuen-sun, who were in jail during the challenge, and Leung Kwok-hung, to challenge the restrictions. Mr. Justice Andrew Cheung ruled that inmates have the constitutional right to register as voters and cast their ballots while serving sentences, which was unjustificably infringed by the indiscriminate ban. Two League of Social Democrats activists also applied for a judicial review to challenge the legality of corporate voting on the grounds that it contravened Article 26 or was discriminatory in nature. Mr. Justice Andrew Cheung dismissed the applications, emphasising that his judgment was solely concerned with the constitutionality of corporate voting rather than the political wisdom of corporate voting or functional constituencies. =Right of abode= The definition of Hong Kong permanent residents is listed in Article 24 of the Basic Law, under which this class of persons enjoy the right of abode. However, the conflict between this Article and Article 22 led to extensive controversies and litigations. Due to Hong Kong's proximity to mainland China, controversy has arisen in the right of abode of children born within the city by a mainland mother. Under current law, both the mother and the child is automatically granted right of abode. This has drawn criticism from Hong Kong citizens who argue that instead of wanting to give birth to their children in a better hospital, mainland mothers are exploiting the law in order to receive right of abode. Proponents for the law, including private doctors, claim that the law encourages medical tourism in Hong Kong thus providing long term benefit for the city. =Right to travel and enter or leave the Region= The freedom of emigration, along with the freedom to travel and to enter or leave the Region, is guaranteed to Hong Kong residents under Article 31 of the Basic Law and Article 8(2) of the Bill of Rights. On the other hand, section 11(10) of the Immigration Ordinance provides that any permission given to a person to land or remain in Hong Kong shall, if in force on the day that person departs from Hong Kong, expire immediately after his departure. The case of Gurung Kesh Bahadur v. Director of Immigration illustrated the problem of the provision. Mr. Bahadur, a Nepalese citizen, was a non-permanent resident of Hong Kong since 1995. Extensions of stay were made a few times, and the last one was to expire in January 1999. In October 1997, he flew to Nepal, returning to Hong Kong 7 days later. The Custom refused Mr. Bahadur's application for permission to land by virtue of section 11(10) of the Immigration Ordinance. His challenge of the provision succeeded in the Court of Final Appeal, which held that the provision was on itself constitutional but was unconstitutional when applied to non-permanent residents whose permission to stay had yet to expire. Hence the provision is no longer applicable to the above class of persons. Since the right to enter the Region is a right guaranteed to Hong Kong residents only, the government has been accused of denying entry to politically sensitive persons who are not Hong Kong residents, including US-based activists in the Tiananmen Incident, Falun Gong practitioners, and Tibetian independence supporters. High-profile persons denied entry include Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou and Jens Galschiot, the sculptor of the Pillar of Shame that commemorates the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. On 21 June 2010, the Court of First Instance held that the requirement that, subject to a grace period of 56 days, an adult applicant for Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (\\"CSSA\\") must have resided in Hong Kong continuously for at least one year immediately before the date of application is unconstitutional since it unjustifiably infringes the freedom to travel and the right to equality. The case was brought by Hong Kong permanent resident George Yao Man-fai, who had been previously employed on the mainland. He was refused CSSA after he returned to Hong Kong following the termination of his employment. As a result, the Social Welfare Department announced it is shelving the one-year continuous residence requirement for new and repeat applications for Comprehensive Social Security Assistance. Economic, social and cultural rights under domestic law =Right to form trade unions and to strike= The right to form trade unions and to strike is provided by Article 27 of the Basic Law. The British government ratified the International Labour Conventions in 1949 but it was not until 1979 that the Conventions were partially enforced in Hong Kong. There is a system of compulsory registration under the Trade Union Ordinance (Cap. 332). Under section 5(5) of the Ordinance, the officers of any trade union which fails to register are liable to a fine of $1,000 and imprisonment for six months. The Registrar has the power to monitor trade union activities through the supervision of union rule books, accounts and related documents. Trade unions are obliged by law to report to the Registrar where there are changes to the rule book, or the offices and branches operated by the trade unions. Such legal limits on the right to form trade unions were criticised by the Hong Kong Human Rights Commission. Section 9 of the Employment Ordinance makes it clear that the fact that an employee takes part in a strike does not entitle his employer to terminate the employee's contract of employment. If a worker is dismissed for strike action, he or she would have the right to sue the employer for compensation. However, there is no legal entitlement to reinstatement. The Hong Kong Liaison Office of the International Trade Union Confederation commented that although there is some protection in labour law, workers and unions have little opportunity for defending their rights in practice. =Right to social welfare= The right to social welfare is protected under Article 36 of the Basic Law, which further provides that the welfare benefits and retirement security of the labour force shall be protected by law. The Comprehensive Social Security Assistance is a form of social security provided by the Hong Kong government. The Mandatory Provident Fund is a compulsory saving scheme (pension fund) for the retirement of residents in Hong Kong: both employees and employers have to contribute, as long as the salary of the employee exceeds a statutorily stipulated level. However, there is no social insurance in Hong Kong. The CSSA is only provided to residents of Hong Kong for at least seven years. A new mainland migrant whose Hong Kong husband died a day after her arrival challenged the seven years requirement. On 23 June 2009, the Court of First Instance held that the requirement was a justified restriction of the right to equality. Human rights under international law The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights(ICESCR) and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) are in effect in Hong Kong by virtue of Article 39 of the Basic Law. The ICESCR requires the government to take steps by all appropriate means and to the maximum of its available resources to achieve the rights in the covenants.Article 2, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights The Court has repeatedly expressed the judicial opinion that such rights are positive in nature and are not enforceable unless domestic legislation has been enacted providing for the rights stipulated therein. Unlike the ICCPR, the ICESCR was not incorporated into domestic Hong Kong law and is only binding under international law. Hartmann J's description of the ICESCR as \\"aspirational\\" and \\"promotional\\" sums up the approach of the Hong Kong courts. A number of ICESCR rights are incorporated in the Basic Law, such as the right to form trade unions and to strike (Article 27), right to social welfare (Article 36) and the right to benefit from the production of moral and material interest resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author (Article 140). Although the right to housing (Article 11 of the ICESCR) is not incorporated in any domestic law and is hence not an \\"entitlement\\", the Hong Kong Government has been providing public housing in the nature of \\"grace\\". In 1973, the government announced a 10-year plan to provide self-contained public housing to 1.8 million people. In 1995, public housing accommodated 2 million people, accounting for 45% of all housing. Public housing rental units are provided at subsidised rates (typically 20% of that in the private market), although their allocation is mean tested. The government introduced the Home Ownership Scheme in 1978 and the Sandwich Class Housing Scheme in the 1990s to allow families to own their own homes. Although the right to health is contained in Article 12 of the ICESCR, there is again no entitlement as such in domestic Hong Kong law. However, Article 138 of the Basic Law requires the HKSAR to improve medical and health services by formulating policies to develop Western and Chinese medicine. Healthcare is provided by the government in the nature of \\"grace\\": the Accident & Emergency service and the in-patient (general acute beds) service provided by the Hospital Authority charges HKD180 per visit and HKD120 per day (plus HKD75 admission fee) respectively. 95% of Hong Kong people depend on the in-patient service provided by the public sector and 30% on the out-patient service provided by the public sector.  Criticism of the police  = Allegations of police brutality = Non-Official Human rights groups have accused the Hong Kong Police of using heavy-handed tactics on non- violent protesters. In 2002, Amnesty International cited the use of excessive force in an incident at Chater Garden where more than 350 police and immigrations officers stormed a group of 200 protesters. According to them, the protesters had been peacefully staging rallies against the Court of Final Appeal ruling that the majority of 5,114 people seeking residence in the territory did not have right to stay in Hong Kong and should return to mainland China. In 2002, a group of Falun Gong practitioners who were protesting outside the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region were being forcibly removed from the street by Hong Kong Police with heavy-handed tactics. All were later charged with the offence of Public Place Obstruction. The Falun Gong defendants contested and appealed to the Court of Final Appeal. All defendants in this case (Yeung May-Wan & others v Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) were acquitted. In 2008, police sergeant Thom Wing-hong punched a man in custody, Lik Sin-wan, in the head after the two argued over the way to conduct Lik's search. Lik, who had recently received a head operation, suffered serious injury as the strikes ruptured his reconstructed head bone. Thom then accused Lik of assaulting a police officer. Lik was later charged and appeared in court in August 2008 but was acquitted. The assault only came to light after the magistrate became suspicious of the circumstances of Lik's injury and ordered an investigation. Thom was charged with causing grievous bodily harm and sentenced to 10 months in prison. In 2010, the Hong Kong Police came under heavy criticism for using pepper spray on anti-Guangzhou- Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link protestors who were demonstrating outside the Legislative Council. Shortly after the Legislative Council's approval of the project, a group of demonstrators tried to break through a security cordon and were met with pepper spray. Secretary for Security Ambrose Lee subsequently condemned demonstrators who clashed with the police, saying that they \\"violated stability and law and order\\" and would not be tolerated. When the police was questioned by the Legislative Council for their use of pepper spray, assistant police commissioner Austin Kerrigan claimed the force used was not excessive. He accepted many protestors were peaceful, but said some had crossed the line. He did not directly answer the legislators' question as to whether ample warning was given before using pepper spray. It was revealed 7 police officers suffered injuries in the clash. During the Umbrella Revolution in 2014, the Hong Kong Police faced allegations of police brutality in their handling of protesters. A report released in 2015 claimed that there were over 1,900 complaints filed against the police but only 21 were chosen to be investigated by the police. One incident where a protester was led by seven police officers to a remote location and subsequently beaten received significant media coverage and public outcry. The Hong Kong Police Union was criticized for holding a rally in support of the seven officers. =Political neutrality of the police= Political activist Christina Chan claimed that policemen visited her parents‚Äô home the day before the anti-high-speed rail demonstration and asked irrelevant questions. After being arrested for assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty and subsequently bailed, she claimed the police did not ask any relevant questions to the incident, but harassed her instead. In February 2010, immediately after Andrew To became the Chairman of the League of Social Democrats, he was charged with assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty for his conduct during a demonstration on 1 October 2009. To claimed that certain video records showed that it was the police officers who punched him, and that he did not assault the police. He expressed his belief that the charge was based solely on political ground. =Independence of the police and accountability on policing= Regional police forces are not governed by a police authority consisting of elected officials and local members of public, but solely reports to the Security Bureau of HKSAR government, headed by appointed civil servants from the executive branch of government. Complaints about the police are handled by Complaints against Police Office (CAPO), which is not independent but part of the Hong Kong Police Force. The Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) is set up to independently review every case handled by CAPO, though the IPCC has no investigative powers, and is not involved in hearing appeals to CAPO rulings. Calls for reform, from both local non- government organisations, political parties as well as the UNCHR, have been largely ignored by the government.  National security and Article 23 of Basic Law  Hong Kong SAR has the constitutional duty of safeguarding national security by virtue of Article 23 of the Basic Law. In 2002, in order to fulfil their constitutional duty, the government tabled an anti-subversion bill. However, as with national security legislation in many countries, civil libertarians feared powers in the proposed law would erode the fundamental freedoms of the people. With the backdrop of an authoritarian sovereign state, there were fears that the proposed law would be used to suppress organisations which disagreed with the policies of either the Special Administrative Region or the Central Government.

It existed in its various forms from 1981 through to 1990 under the stewardship of Paul Gravett, Phil Elliott and Ed Pinsent. The name was taken from a Classics Illustrated knock-off spotted in the Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide. History Paul Gravett started the Fast Fiction stall at the bimonthly Westminster Comics Mart in London, England in 1981 selling imported European comics, or Bande Dessin√©e. Having discovered that interesting new comics were being published in short run photocopy form he contacted the creators and offered to sell their comics on his stall and through mail order. Initially this was done for free with a small percentage cut being introduced later. The Fast Fiction stall became the de facto social centre for small press publishers along with the adjoining pub, The Westminster Arms. Cartoonist Phil Elliott and Ian Wieczorek took over Fast Fiction in late 1981 when Gravett started working for Pssst! magazine leading to him launching Escape Magazine. The bimonthly stall and mail order distro continued along with a regular information sheet listing titles available to order, and a new anthology featuring cartoonists they sold. This was also called Fast Fiction debuting in 1982 with a print run of 100 copies and lasting until 1991 with issues 29 and 30 reviewed in Zum! #1. Ed Pinsent, another cartoonist who had been involved in the cassette culture music trading scene, subsequently took over from Elliott and continued to run things until 1990. Following the closure of Fast Fiction their mailing list was passed on to Luke Walsh (later known as Luke Temple Walsh) and Mike Kidson who used it to launch the small press comics review zine Zum!.

Pennywell is the largest local authority housing estate in the City of Sunderland. The estate mostly built during the late 1940s and early 1950s to replace 19th century slums in the centre of Sunderland. The name Pennywell is of Celtic origin and is thought to mean \\"wellspring at the top of the hill\\". The Pennywell estate consists of nearly 3,000 homes, around 11% of which are privately owned and has a total population of 10,709 This figure is considerably lower than in previous decades, when the Pennywell area housed over 20,000 people. Pennywell has traditionally been associated with high crime rates since the estate was completed in 1953. Knife crime and anti- social behaviour have been a growing problem since the 1990s. The estate was the scene of a murder when 22-year-old Kevin Johnson was fatally stabbed outside his house on Patrick Road in the early hours of 19 May 2007. Three teenagers were convicted of the murder six months later and sentenced to life imprisonment. At the trial, it was revealed that after stabbing Kevin Johnson, the three defendants had gone on to attack another man in the area and also damaged two cars. Mr Johnson's family later had two applications for criminal injuries compensation rejected on the basis that he had contributed to his own death by leaving the safety of his home to confront the teenagers about their noisy behaviour. A third application for compensation was successful and the Johnson family received ¬£5,500 from a scheme which could already pay a maximum of ¬£500,000 to claimants. In April 1994, The Independent newspaper condemned Pennywell as a \\"no go area\\" and one of the worst places in Britain, highlighting an unemployment rate as 19% (around twice the national average) and that attacks on police and vandalism of police vehicles were a frequent occurrence in the area. As a result of these events, the Gentoo Group are undertaking a massive programme of renewal and regeneration for the area which will provide a high standard of modern housing for social housing tenants and homeowners alike. The first phases of this plan, at Waterford Green, are nearing completion. An industrial area on the western edge of the suburb has, among other businesses Calsonic's injection moulding plant and the Sunderland Echo building. Pennywell Comprehensive School was built in 1967 and remained open until 2008. It was finally demolished in 2009 and replaced with a new facility on the same site ‚Äì Academy 360. Pupils attending the comprehensive school were members of one of four houses - Stratford (green), Harwell (blue), Everest (yellow) and Runnymede (red). The school boasted excellent sporting facilities including several full size football/rugby pitches, an all-weather athletics track, a fully equipped sports hall (incorporating five-a-side pitches, basketball/netball courts & cricket nets), fully equipped indoor gymnasium with balance beams/climbing ropes/trampoline harnesses, outdoor cricket pitches, tennis courts and several tarmac yard areas with basketball courts. Classrooms were predominantly located in four five-storey tower blocks (B, C, D & E blocks) and included science laboratories, art studios, home economics kitchens and IT suites. The new school (Academy 360) has three houses, Oxford (blue), Mowbray (green), Doxford (red).

It is one of the 12 instruments of the cobla. The flabiol measures about 25 centimeters in length and has five or six holes on its front face and three underneath.  Overview  The two main types are the dry flabiol without keys, usually made of a hardwood such as bubinga, and the keyed flabiol, used in coblas for sardana dances and in other folk music ensembles. The flabiol is normally played by the left hand while the player uses the right hand to beat a small drum (called tambor√≠) attached to the left elbow. All sardanes played by a cobla begin with a short introduction (introit) from the flabiol which is terminated by a single tap of the tambor√≠. Its traditional geographic zone extends from the south of Catalonia to the Roussillon area of France, and from the Eastern strip of Aragon to the Balearic islands, where it is used as solo instrument with its own melodies. Apart from being in the cobla for the performance of sardanes, the flabiol is also found in the reduced version of the cobla known as cobla of three quarters formed of one tarota or tible, a flabiol and a sac de gemecs (bagpipes).  Flabiol fingering  The flabiol is a transposing instrument in the key of F, and the played notes sound an eleventh (octave and a perfect fourth) higher than those written. The Flabiol requires special playing skill, because it is generally played only with the left hand, using the thumb and the first three fingers, with the little finger able to play a tone hole under the instrument and providing the required stability. The four holes at the lower end are used as vent holes and for tuning with wax plugs. If any of the four lowest semitones are required, the thumb and one or two fingers of the right hand have to be used. Keyed versions have the key pads between the top 3 toneholes for fast play. The Flabiol is the original model for the modern Tonette or Flutophone, popular with school children.

It lives in the tropical Americas. White- throated spadebill (above), and yellow-throated spadebill (below); illustration by Joseph Smit, 1888 Description The adult white-throated spadebill is 3.8 in (9.7 cm) long, weighs 0.33 oz (9.3 g), and has large eyes and a very short tail. The large head is distinctively marked, with a long yellowish supercilium, blackish ear coverts, yellow eyering, and a black stripe down each side of the neck. The crown has a concealed yellow crest, which is erected as a fan by the singing male. The upperparts are dark olive brown, and the underparts are buff apart from the white throat. The bill is black above and brown below, and is very broad and flat, hence the English and scientific names \\"spadebill\\" and Platyrinchus. Sexes are similar, other than the female having a smaller crown patch, but young birds are brighter and ruddier above, lack the crown patch, and have a grey throat and breast shading to a whitish belly. They are not particularly vocal but have a sharp chweet call. The subspecies Platyrinchus mystaceus insularis occurs only in Trinidad, Tobago and in Venezuela, other forms differing in the brightness of the underparts or the crown colour. The taxonomy of this species is uncertain, with some dubious subspecies, but also the possibility that what is usually treated as the white-throated spadebill consists of more than one species. Distribution and ecology The white-throated spadebill breeds from Costa Rica through South America to western Ecuador, Brazil, and northeastern Argentina. It also occurs on both Trinidad and Tobago. This bird was recently found to be far more common on the Amazonian slope of the Colombian Cordillera Oriental than it was believed in the 20th century. It is not rare in its wide range, and thus not considered a threatened species by the IUCN.Salaman et al. (2002), BLI (2008) This species is found in wet hill forests and will to some extent use secondary forest and other disturbed habitat. It likes habitat with thick, tangled undergrowth and medium-sized trees with a canopy height of 33‚Äì100 ft (10‚Äì30 m) such as Elaeagia (Rubiaceae) and Hieronyma oblonga (Phyllanthaceae), overgrown with epiphytes and hemiepiphytes (e.g. Clusiaceae).Salaman et al. (2002) White-throated spadebills are solitary active birds, difficult to see as they move rapidly through the undergrowth in search of small arthropods, their mainstay food. These are taken with a sudden upward-darting sally flight and audible bill-snap from under the foliage, or less often from mid-air. This species occasionally joins mixed-species feeding flocks.Machado (1999), de A. Gabriel & Pizo (2005) The deep cup nest is made of dead grass and plant fibres and placed low in a sapling. The typical clutch is two yellow-tinged white eggs with a rufous wreath. Notes References * de A. Gabriel, Vagner & Pizo, Marco A.

Various techniques are employed to estimate the parameters from matrices of response data. The most common approaches are types of maximum likelihood estimation, such as joint and conditional maximum likelihood estimation. Joint maximum likelihood (JML) equations are efficient, but inconsistent for a finite number of items, whereas conditional maximum likelihood (CML) equations give consistent and unbiased item estimates. Person estimates are generally thought to have bias associated with them, although weighted likelihood estimation methods for the estimation of person parameters reduce the bias. Rasch model The Rasch model for dichotomous data takes the form: : \\\\Pr \\\\\\\\{X_{ni}=1\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{\\\\exp({\\\\beta_n} - {\\\\delta_i})}{1 + \\\\exp({\\\\beta_n} - {\\\\delta_i})}, where \\\\beta_n is the ability of person n and \\\\delta_i is the difficulty of item i . Joint maximum likelihood Let x_{ni} denote the observed response for person n on item i. The probability of the observed data matrix, which is the product of the probabilities of the individual responses, is given by the likelihood function : \\\\Lambda = \\\\frac{\\\\prod_{n} \\\\prod_{i} \\\\exp(x_{ni}(\\\\beta_n-\\\\delta_i))}{\\\\prod_{n} \\\\prod_{i}(1+\\\\exp(\\\\beta_n-\\\\delta_i))}. The log-likelihood function is then : \\\\log \\\\Lambda = \\\\sum_n^N \\\\beta_n r_n - \\\\sum_i^I \\\\delta_i s_i - \\\\sum_n^N \\\\sum_i^I \\\\log(1+\\\\exp(\\\\beta_n-\\\\delta_i)) where r_n=\\\\sum_i^I x_{ni} is the total raw score for person n, s_i=\\\\sum_n^N x_{ni} is the total raw score for item i, N is the total number of persons and I is the total number of items. Solution equations are obtained by taking partial derivatives with respect to \\\\delta_i and \\\\beta_n and setting the result equal to 0. The JML solution equations are: : s_i = \\\\sum_n^N p_{ni},\\\\quad i=1,\\\\dots,I : r_n = \\\\sum_i^I p_{ni},\\\\quad n=1,\\\\dots,N where p_{ni}=\\\\exp(\\\\beta_n-\\\\delta_i)/(1+\\\\exp(\\\\beta_n-\\\\delta_i)). The resulting estimates are biased, and no finite estimates exist for persons with score 0 (no correct responses) or with 100% correct responses (perfect score). The same holds for items with extreme scores, no estimates exists for these as well. This bias is due to a well known effect described by Kiefer & Wolfowitz (1956). It is of the order (I-1)/I, and a more accurate (less biased) estimate of each \\\\delta_i is obtained by multiplying the estimates by (I-1)/I. Conditional maximum likelihood The conditional likelihood function is defined as : \\\\Lambda = \\\\prod_{n} \\\\Pr\\\\\\\\{(x_{ni})\\\\mid r_n\\\\\\\\} =\\\\frac{\\\\exp(\\\\sum_i -s_i\\\\delta_i)}{\\\\prod_{n} \\\\gamma_r} in which : \\\\gamma_r = \\\\sum_{(x) \\\\mid r}\\\\exp(-\\\\sum_i x_{ni}\\\\delta_i) is the elementary symmetric function of order r, which represents the sum over all combinations of r items. For example, in the case of three items, : \\\\gamma_2 = \\\\exp(-\\\\delta_1-\\\\delta_2)+\\\\exp(-\\\\delta_1-\\\\delta_3)+\\\\exp(-\\\\delta_2-\\\\delta_3). Estimation algorithms Some kind of expectation-maximization algorithm is used in the estimation of the parameters of Rasch models. Algorithms for implementing Maximum Likelihood estimation commonly employ Newton-Raphson iterations to solve for solution equations obtained from setting the partial derivatives of the log-likelihood functions equal to 0. Convergence criteria are used to determine when the iterations cease. For example, the criterion might be that the mean item estimate changes by less than a certain value, such as 0.001, between one iteration and another for all items.

They do not appear under that name exactly in ancient history, however, but rather come on stage boldly and abruptly in the Germania (Chapter 42) of Tacitus as the Naristi, with manuscript variants of Narisci and Varisti. Perhaps the historical name of the mediaeval province is to be regarded as the final authority, but there are other possibilities: *The sources only state Latinized names of native originals that could be spelled in various ways in Latin. * The people were in the process of changing their name. Tacitus describes the location of the Varisci as being along the line of the Danube between the Hermunduri at its source and the Marcomanni and Quadi in Bohemia. Ptolemy (Book 2, Chapter 10) adds that the Ouaristoi were south of the Sudeten Mountains and west of Gabreta Forest. The sources thus agree on their location. Tacitus says that they were allies of the Marcomanni and Quadi in their bold expulsion of the Celtic Boii from their ancient home. Very likely, then, all three allies were not from that region, but moved into it in the time of Julius Caesar (in the 1st century BC). We do not know where they had been or what they had been called. One presumes that the Marcomanni (\\"border men\\") took their name from being on the Danubian frontier. The Narisci are stated to be of the Suebi. That is all history tells us. Ptolemy states the names of some towns in the district, but what language they are or whether they were taken over or founded anew he does not say. The towns that might reasonably be interpreted as in the Variscan domain are Bicurgium, Menosgada, Marobudum, Setuacotum, Brodentia, Abilunum and Usbium on the Danube. History records the probable end of the Varisci without giving us anything in between. It was equally bold and sudden as the beginning. On or about the year 167, all the peoples along the Danube, Germanic and other, suddenly attacked the Roman frontier in the reign of Marcus Aurelius. Perhaps they mistook goodness for weakness. He rushed to the defense of the realm and after a long series of episodes, called by us the Marcomannic Wars, because the Marcomanni had instigated and coordinated the attack, forced the enemy to terms. During the fight, the chief of the Naristi ...Valao was killed by the Roman General Marcus Valerius Maximianus. The Marcomannic Wars are chronicled and explained in Marcellinus Ammianus, although the Varisci are not mentioned there. They do find brief mention as the Varistae of the Vita Marci Antonini Philosophi (Chapter 22) of Julius Capitolinus. They were among the tribes who crossed the Danube, but are not mentioned after that, nor do they continue in their province, as the Armalausi inhabit it in the Peutinger Tables. The best guess as to their eventual fate is that they were transplanted to Italy, along with many other Danube-dwelling warrior peoples, by Marcus Aurelius, where he could watch over them. This kind of solution is familiar to us in modern times. Subsequent Germanic attacks overwhelmed and overran the empire. The Varisci probably lost their identity after the fall of the Roman Empire.

More recently, the term \\"balance\\" has come to refer to a balance of power between multiple opposing forces. Lack of balance (of power) is generally considered to cause aggression by stronger forces towards weaker forces less capable of defending themselves. In the real world, unbalanced stronger forces tend to portray themselves as balanced, and use media controls to downplay this, as well as prevent weaker forces from coming together to achieve a new balance of power. In constructed worlds, such as in video gaming, where nearly all-powerful corporate interests strive to maintain a balance of power among players, players tend to be extremely vocal about what they see as unbalanced mechanics, providing the unbalance negatively affects them. Though the strong and unbalanced (or \\"overpowered\\") players commonly are vigorous in denial of any lack of balance, the comparative media equality among all player brings change quickly, to further a sense of balance. Artistic balance The twentieth century saw the development of both law and chaos in art (and art-music) to the point that the end product became unintelligible at an instinctive/emotional level. Many composers saw one or other of these controlling trends as superior to the other. The truth may lie in a fundamental acceptance of balance as the controlling force in art. In time, we may even come to accept balance between structural and emotional as the essence of beauty. Moral balance In philosophy, the concept of moral balance exists in various forms, one of them is the golden mean, which has virtue being between the extreme and the lacking. Greek philosophers‚Äîsuch as Plato, Aristotle, and the Pythagoreans (who related moral excellence with mathematical perfection)‚Äîapplied the principle to ethics as well as politics. \\"Nothing in excess\\" was one of the three phrases carved into the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. In Buddhism, this concept is known as the middle way, or samatƒÅ, which stated that the way to nirvana led between bodily sexual indulgence and self-mortification and asceticism.

Model history From 1999, there were three different models of the 996: a base, or Biposto; the 996S with √ñhlins suspension; the 996SPS (Europe only) which had a more powerful engine and less weight thanks to some titanium and carbon fibre parts. From 2001 the 996R replaced the 996SPS and featured the new Testastretta engine. There was also the 748, which offered less horsepower. The 996 had larger pistons, larger valves, a stronger crankshaft and crankcases ported from the 916 SPS. But since the 916 camshaft gave a softer, less peaky power delivery and less top-end power ( versus the SPS‚Äôs ) the 996 was built with a new air intake system with two fuel injectors per cylinder. A new airbox and a distinctive underseat exhaust system were also built into the new design. The chassis was also modified. Lighter wheels were introduced along with improved calipers, discs and pads stronger compared to the 916. The suspension system was still the same Showa design but both the front and back were fully adjustable for damping and preload. 2000 996 Biposto Updates in 2000 saw the wheels change and get updated to all new Marchesini wheels. The front forks were also titanium nitrided to reduce stiction. The spokes also changed from the three-spoke rim style of the 916 to a new five- spoke scheme. In 2001 another overhaul saw the 996 rear shock absorber change from a Showa to an √ñhlins. In 2002, the 996 was superseded by the Ducati 998. =996 SPS= The 996SPS suffix stood for ‚ÄòSport Production Special‚Äô. The engine was the same as the one used in the 916SPS but the weight was cut down considerably. The 996SPS produced around 92.4 kW (124 bhp), more than the standard 996. The 996‚Äôs special SPS engine was much stronger than anything that Ducati or any other manufacturer at the time had produced for the track. To ensure a distance was held between the standard 996 and the 996SPS Ducati designed a much higher specification chassis for the SPS. The wheels were a five spoke design but were lighter than the standard three spoke design of the 916 and the early 996. In 1999 the rear shocks were made by high quality Swedish suspensions manufacturer, √ñhlins with Showa front forks. In 2000 √ñhlins forks were added. The adjustable steering head also allowed geometry changes to the steel tube trellis frame making it suitable for different riding styles or race tracks. =996 R= In 2001 Ducati introduced the limited production (only 500 were built), 996 R, the suffix standing for ‚ÄòRacing‚Äô, which featured √ñhlins suspension (rear and front), carbon fiber bodywork, a revised and more streamlined fairing, but most importantly the newly redesigned engine, the Testastretta (narrow-head) which actually displaced 998cc. The engine got its name from the narrower angle between the intake and exhaust valves, down to only 25 degrees, which was designed by Ing. Marchetti, coming from Ferrari F1. It featured more aggressive camshafts, titanium conrods and a shorter stroke and wider bore, which allowed it to rev more safely at high RPMs. It produced 98.5 kW (136 bhp) at 10,200 RPM with a maximum torque of 105 Nm at 8000 RPM. Most of the chassis was the same as the 996 SPS, but using a new Brembo braking system, with thinner discs and 4-pad, 4-pot calipers with 34mm pistons. =Final updates= Ducati 996 Biposto Ducati updated the bike with √ñhlins front forks, which featured a titanium nitride coating on the stanchions to minimise friction.

Named in honor of explorer John Charles Fr√©mont and located in the heart of the downtown casino corridor, Fremont Street is today, or was, the address for many famous casinos such as Binion's Horseshoe, Eldorado Club, Fremont Hotel and Casino, Golden Gate Hotel and Casino, Golden Nugget, Four Queens, The Mint, and the Pioneer Club. Fremont Hotel & Casino, Las Vegas Prior to the construction of the Fremont Street Experience, the western end of Fremont Street was the representative scene for Las Vegas that was included in virtually every television show and movie that wanted to depict the glittery lights of Las Vegas. The abundance of neon signs, like cowboy Vegas Vic, earned the street the nickname of \\"Glitter Gulch\\". Fremont Street is designated between Main Street and Sahara Avenue in a northwest‚Äìsoutheast direction, although auto traffic actually begins at Las Vegas Boulevard. At Sahara, it leaves Las Vegas proper and continues as Boulder Highway. Fremont Street formerly carried several national highways, including U.S. Route 93 (US 93), US 95, and US 466\\\\. US 93 and US 95 have been rerouted along Interstate 515, while US 466 has been decommissioned. The section of Fremont Street east of the Fremont East District is currently designated Nevada State Route 582. Although prostitution has been illegal in Clark County since 1971, the street has a reputation for prostitution.  History  Fremont Street's illuminated \\"Space Frame\\" Fremont Street dates back to 1905, when Las Vegas itself was founded. Fremont Street was the first paved street in Las Vegas in 1925 and received the city's first traffic light in 1931. Fremont Street also carried the shields of U.S. Route 93 (US 93), US 95, and US 466 before the construction of the interstate freeways, including I-15. While gambling was established prior to being legalized, the Northern Club in 1931 received one of the first 6 gambling licenses issued in Nevada, and the first one for Fremont Street. Glitter Gulch on Fremont Street, was closed to vehicle traffic in September, 1994, to begin construction on the Fremont Street Experience. = Film and media history = The Golden Nugget and Binion's casinos at night View northwest along Fremont Street at Las Vegas Boulevard * The 1964 Elvis Presley film Viva Las Vegas featured nighttime footage of Fremont Street during the opening credits. * The 1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever featured a chase scene in which James Bond, running from Las Vegas police, side-rolls a car through an alley exiting onto Fremont Street. * The 1978-81 ABC television series Vega$, starring Robert Urich, had its episode intro, and many scenes, filmed on Fremont Street. * The 1987 music video for the song \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" by U2 was filmed on Fremont Street and featured the band members wandering around, while The Edge played an acoustic guitar. * In the 1987 anthology film, Aria, one of the segments involves two young lovers driving down Fremont Street before attempting suicide. * The second season of the NBC show Crime Story (1986-1988) featured Fremont Street in its opening credits, and nearly all the action took place there, as opposed to the Strip. * 1998's Very Bad Things featured Fremont Street in the movie. * 1992's Honey, I Blew Up the Kid prominently featured Fremont Street in the movie. * 1992's Cool World showed all the animation coming out of the Union Plaza Hotel and going down Fremont Street. * In 1994, Glitter Gulch was featured prominently in the TV miniseries The Stand. * The 1997 comedy Vegas Vacation includes a few scenes on Fremont Street. * The Flaming Lips filmed part of their video for \\"Do You Realize??\\" in Fremont Street * In the 2004 movie Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, Steve the Pirate is seen along the Plaza near the Fremont Street Experience. * In a 2005 release, Panic! at the Disco released a song about Fremont Street called \\"Build God, Then We'll Talk\\". * Fremont Street appears in the 2004 video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas as \\"The Old Las Venturas Strip\\". * The 2007 film Next has Nicolas Cage's character entering the Golden Nugget from the Fremont Street Experience. * Ice Cube's music video for \\"Chrome and Paint\\" took place on Fremont Street, with Ice Cube in a lowrider. * In Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas, Logan Keller, and his teammates Jung, and Michael infiltrate Fremont Street to find a news van, which they find by going through the maintenance tunnels under the Sirocco Casino, the game's version of the Binion Hotel and Gambling Hall. * Heavily referenced in the Tom Waits song \\"Mr. Siegal\\". * Featured at the beginning of the TV series - CSI season 7 finale episode 24. * Magician & illusionist, Criss Angel, has done many demonstrations there. * Featured in The Real World: Las Vegas (2011).

The $5.5 million streetscape improvement project was a public private partnership with 50% paid by landlords via new businesses and 50% paid with tax dollars as part of a plans to revitalize Downtown Las Vegas. The area was redesigned to increase the draw to downtown, with a compact entertainment area of bars and clubs. The three- block renovation included pedestrian-friendly street redesign, landscaping, and retro-looking new neon signage. It also included 4 vintage Vegas neon signs in the street median, built new but reminiscent of classic Las Vegas signs. Fremont East street improvements opened officially in the summer of 2007. Currently, the Fremont East Entertainment District comprises a total of six blocks. The boundaries are from Las Vegas Boulevard East to 8th Street, and then from Ogden Street South to Carson. The historic El Cortez hotel and casino are within the district as well as the staple cocktail bar Downtown Cocktail Room .

At the 2006 census, its population was 8,376, in 1,765 families. History of Bastak The history of Bastak can be traced back to the Safavids era. When the Safavids under Ismail I decided to convert everyone residing in current day Iran from Sunni to Shiite Islam in 1501, they started arranged attacks and massacres against the Sunni Persians who refused to convert. As a result, many Sunni Persians left their hometowns for the Zagros Mountains. After the Battle of Chaldiran where the Safavids lost to the Ottoman the Sunni Persians descended from the mountains to begin a new life in the land they named \\"Bastak\\", meaning barrier or backstop signifying barrier from Shiite Safavids' attacks and influences. Bastakis in the Persian Gulf Bastakis emigrated to Dubai, Bahrain, and Kuwait and there are Bastaki families found in Dubai, Bahrain, Dammam, Khobar, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman, who have carried their Persian culture, language, and architecture with them. A neighborhood in Dubai, Bastakeyah, is named after the Iranian village and Persian architecture is found in the area; namely, badgirs or \\"wind catchers\\" that are intended to direct wind directly into structures to cool its interior, while also removing excess heat in the updraft.

History The first full issue was distributed in Fall 1993 as a quarterly magazine to accompany the increasingly popular Magic: The Gathering trading card game. Prior the 1st issue, a special one-time Duelist Issue #0 was released and given away at Gen Con 1993. It later became a monthly gaming magazine in March 1995 with simply a focus on the collectible card game and trading card game industry before publication ceased in September 1999. The magazine was based in Renton, Washington. As Magic grew, a companion newsletter (The Duelist Companion) was sent out to The Duelist subscribers in between magazine releases; eventually this was dropped in favor of bimonthly magazine circulation, and still later a monthly magazine. The Duelist ran for 41 issues (42 if Duelist #0 is counted). The magazine was replaced with Topdeck, which was canceled in February 2001 after 15 issues, partially due to cutting costs as a result of Hasbro's purchase of Wizards of the Coast, but also due to competition from Internet resources. Wizards was already publishing The Sideboard, which was dedicated solely to Magic tournament play that eventually was reborn as an online publication, and in The Duelist's wake, some of the content from the magazine merged with The Sideboard to create magicthegathering.com. Contents What initially separated The Duelist from other card magazines of its time, such as InQuest or Scrye, was its detailed pages. Each issue featured a key artist who created a unique cover (often based on an existing Magic card) and whose art was showcased inside the issue; however in later issues, these art features were discontinued. In addition to its artwork, the magazine also included articles on various strategies, game design articles, fiction from Magic storylines, product checklists, rules questions, Magic tournament coverage; even Magic puzzles were eventually introduced. Price-lists would be included as well. Phil Foglio and his wife Kaja resurrected Phil's former Dragon strip \\"What's New?\\", which ran for almost the entire life of The Duelist, and a deck-construction column called Excuse Me, Mr. Suitcase? (\\"Mr. Suitcase\\" being a reference to the large collections of cards that some players would carry with them) was among the other regular features. Magic: The Gathering creator Richard Garfield often wrote the quizzical back column of the magazine. The Duelist was known to occasionally give out promotional cards from upcoming Magic: The Gathering releases. In addition to Magic, it also served as a way for Wizards to introduce players to other products it owned, including the moderately obscure Vampire: The Eternal Struggle and the more popular Legend of the Five Rings. Other card games were profiled, such as Star Trek, Star Wars, and the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game. Magic gradually lost the magazine's focus as it put more emphasis on up-and-coming card games; with Pok√©mon's immediate North American success, The Duelist was converted into a dual-format publication, with general separate sections for Magic and Pok√©mon. By this time, it had already expanded to covering video games and others. Reception The Duelist won the Origins Award for Best Professional Gaming Magazine of 1994.

As initially drafted, s 51(xxvi) empowered the Parliament to make laws with respect to: \\"The people of any race, other than the aboriginal race in any State, for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws\\". The Australian people voting at the 1967 referendum deleted the words in italics. Edmund Barton had argued in 1898 that s 51(xxvi) was necessary to enable the Commonwealth to \\"regulate the affairs of the people of coloured or inferior races who are in the Commonwealth\\". The section was intended to enable the Commonwealth to pass laws restricting such migrant labourers such as the Chinese and Kanakas. Quick and Garran observed in 1901 that \\"It enables the Parliament to deal with the people of any alien race after they have entered the Commonwealth; to localise them within defined areas, to restrict their migration, to confine them to certain occupations, or to give them special protection and secure their return after a certain period to the country whence they came.\\" There were delegates, however, at the 1898 Convention who argued against the use of legislative power to deal specifically with alien races, accepting that people might be excluded from Australia based on race, but arguing that once people were admitted to the country they should be treated in the same way as other citizens. Charles Kingston at pp. 244-7, John Quick at pp, 245‚Äì6 and Josiah Symon at p. 250. The scope of s 51(xxvi) is, subject to the Constitution itself, unfettered in keeping with s 51 granting plenary powers to the Commonwealth.. Section 51(xxvi) supports the rejection of legal equality requirements when considering legislation otherwise validly enacted under the Constitution. at pp. 44-5 per Brennan CJ. Thus legislation empowered by other constitutional powers, such as in the Northern Territory National Emergency Response,. which was empowered by section 122,. may be racially discriminatory. In Kartinyeri v Commonwealth, the High Court was split on whether s 51(xxvi) could be used to enact legislation that adversely discriminated on the basis of race. Justices Gummow and Hayne held that the use of race as the ais of parliamentary power was inherently discriminatory and that benefits to the people of one race may be detrimental to people of another.. Justice Kirby disagreed, holding that the race power did not permit the enactment of laws to the detriment of the people of any race.. Justice Gaudron held that it was difficult to conceive of circumstances in which a law to the disadvantage of a racial minority would be valid.. In a report delivered to the Australian prime minister on 19 January 2012, it was recommended that a referendum be held for the repeal of s 51(xxvi), to be replaced by s 51A (which empowers the Commonwealth to make laws for Indigenous Australians, but also recognises Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as Australia's first peoples) and s 116A (which prohibits racially discriminatory legislation or the making of laws under s51A that are not for the benefit of Indigenous peoples).

A Soap Opera adapted the same songs and plot to an audio presentation, with Ritchie in the same role. Plans for a full-scale theatrical tour were not realised, but the Kinks, with their extended mid-70s lineup, did perform the entire album on tour in 1975. Though the album was not well-received, Dave Thompson, reviewing an unofficial bootleg recording, called the live presentation \\"a revelation\\". Plot Soap Opera is the third concept album in the band's \\"theatrical period\\". It tells the story of a musician named Starmaker who changes places with an \\"ordinary man\\" named Norman to better understand life. Starmaker beds Norman's wife Andrea and then goes to work the next day, getting caught in the rush hour. He works 9 to 5 and then visits the pub for a few drinks before making his way home. Andrea greets him, and he tells her she is \\"making it all worthwhile\\". By this point, Starmaker has lost his grip on reality; he doesn't know who he is anymore. In the end, he settles down with Andrea, accepting that he is now just \\"a face in the crowd\\". The album concludes with the sentiment that, although rock stars may fade, their music lives on. The Starmaker is an exaggerated characterization of Ray Davies. He would often use his name in the stage version of Soap Opera and perform previous hit Kinks songs as examples of his work as a star to explain that he is not actually the \\"ordinary\\" Norman. Tributes In 1994 Moog Konttinen recorded a Finnish translation of the album as Saippuaooppera.

On the auspicious day of Diwali amidst the bursting of firecrackers on the banks of Mahanadi (called Gadgadia ghat) people celebrate the victory of good over evil and pay tribute to the goddess Kali. * But the festival which Cuttackis look forward to most is the Bali Yatra. Bali Yatra is supposedly the second largest trade festival in Asia. In olden times, merchants used to trade with South-East Asian countries. Whatever items they brought from those places after trading Oriya goods used to be put up for sale in the capital (which was then Cuttack). People from all over the state and beyond used to come to Cuttack to buy these items. Bali Yatra is the festival of continuing this ancient tradition.

Biography =Birth and early life= Gwangjong was born in 925 as Wang So, fourth son of King Taejo, who had founded Goryeo in 918. His mother was queen Sinmyeongsunseong of the Chungju Yu clan, who also gave birth to princes Wang Tae, Wang Yo, Wang Jeong, and Jeungtong, and princesses Nangnang and Heungbang. Moreover, Gwangjong had twenty half-brothers and seven half- sisters from his father's other marriages. As he had three older brothers, Mu, Tae and Yo, he was far from the succession to the throne; however, Wang Tae died early on, and Wang Mu died in 945, three years after being crowned king, leaving the throne to Wang Yo, who ruled Goryeo for four years as Jeongjong. Before dying, he decided to make Wang So his heir instead of his one and only son, prince Gyeongchunwon. According to contemporary Choe Seungno, Gwangjong \\"was careful and laconic, but bold if he had to seize an opportunity.\\" He had excellent appearance and qualities, and he received a special love from his father. During his time as a prince, he gave a great contribution in the crowning of Wang Yo as Jeongjong, and played a big role in removing opposing forces to the sovereigns: one was Wang Gyu, who had helped King Taejo in the founding of Goryeo, climbing to the position of prime minister, and who, after King Hyejong was crowned, tried to carry out a coup to raise his grandson, prince Gwangju, to the throne. The second one was Park Sul-hee, a general who promoted the appointment of Hyejong to Crown Prince and continued to support him later, becoming a threat to Jeongjong's coronation. =Reign= When Gwangjong ascended the throne on April 13, 949, at the age of 25, the kingdom of Goryeo was unstable: to unify the Later Three Kingdoms, his father Taejo made alliances with powerful and influential families through marriages. Keeping them satisfied was paramount, as those families all had their own armies and could rebel at any time. For this reason, Gwangjong felt the need to consolidate the power of the king and made the creation of an absolute monarchy the purpose of his entire government. To avoid an increase in the power and in the influence of noble families, he refused to marry a woman from a noble clan, but instead married into the royal family: queen Daemok was his half-sister, whose mother came from the Hwangbo family of Hwangju (ko), while his second wife, princess Gyeonghwagung, was born by his elder half-brother Hyejong, second king of Goryeo, and his first wife, of the Im family of Chinju (ko). Along with studying Taizong of Tang's book Difan () to better understand what to do, as he found many similarities between his situation and that of Taizong, Gwangjong rewarded all those who contributed to the progress of Goryeo, also making much effort to maintain good diplomatic relations with neighboring countries. This allowed him to concentrate power from within and without the court, and, seven years after the start of his reign, enact a series of reforms to promote a stable and royal-centered political system, and to expand economy and military. His first reform was the law of emancipation of slaves () in 956. The noble families had many slaves, mainly prisoners of war, who served as private soldiers; they numbered more than commoners and didn't pay taxes to the crown, but to the clan they worked for. By emancipating them, Gwangjong turned them into commoners, weakening the noble families' power, and gaining people who paid taxes to the king and could become part of his army. This reform won his government the support of the people, while nobles were against it; even queen Daemok tried to stop the king as the law affected her family, but to no avail. In 957, scholar Shuang Ji was sent to Goryeo as an envoy, and, with his advice, Gwangjong instituted the national civil service examination () in 958, with the goal to expel officials who gained court positions due to family influence or reputation rather than by merit. The examination, based on the Tang's civil service exam and the Confucian classics, was open to all male free-borns to give everyone, not only the rich and powerful people, the opportunity to work for the state, but in practice only sons of the gentry could gain the necessary education to take the exam; royal relatives of the five highest ranks were, instead, left out on purpose. In 960, the king introduced different colours for court robes to distinguish officials of different ranks. During Gwangjong's reign, medical centers known as Daebi-won (), which provided free medicines to poor patients, were set up in Kaesong and Pyongyang, later expanding in the provinces as the Hyeminguk (). Taejo had established regional granaries () to face the times of drought, and Gwangjong added jewibo (), stores which charged interests on grain loans, which were then used for poor relief. These measures, even if in modified forms, kept on working for the next 900 years, parallel to better cultivation methods to keep up with the growth of population. When emperor Shizong of Later Zhou died in 959, leaving the throne to his six-year-old son, the dynasty fell as the army, who was marching towards the northern border, defected and chose its commander Zhao Kuangyin as emperor. As Zhao decided to return from battlefield to found the Song dynasty, he left the mountains of Manchuria and the northern plains to Khitans and Jurchens. To improve Goryeo's defences, Gwangjong reorganized and expanded military, and built twelve garrisons along the northeast and northwest borders; also, under his reign, the kingdom moved the border beyond the Chongchon river, heading towards the Yalu river. Gwangjong saw the association of religious institutions and the state as an aid to subdue local lords, and chose the abbot of Haeinsa Temple to promote Buddhism among the people. He took capable monks as advisers, and promoted the construction of temples: for example, he built the Yongjusa Temple in Cheongju, North Chungcheong, in 962, and the Cheongpyeongsa Temple in Chuncheon, Gangwon, in 973. The king also created an exam for Buddhist priests, called seonggwa (), to link the government and the church, and he attempted to make peace between the Zen and textual schools to unify them under a single order, but he didn't have much success. Other actions undertaken to reinforce the royal authority were naming Goryeo an empire and himself Emperor, thus ending tributary relationships with China; calling Kaesong the Imperial Capital and Pyongyang the Western Capital, and adopting the era name Gwangdeok () from 949 to 951, and Junpung () from 960 to 963. By placing himself in the position of the emperor, he tried to instill in his servants that he had an absolute power. Gwangjong's reforms were not well- received by the nobles, especially by high military and civil officials who helped his father in the foundation of Goryeo. The dissent of the nobles led them to stage a rebellion, but this attempt failed. In his eleventh year of reign, 960, Gwangjong started a series of purges, killing off his opposers: among them, there were his brother Wang Won (ninth prince Hyoeun), who was suspected of treason and poisoned, king Hyejong's son prince Heunghwa, and king Jeongjong's son prince Gyeongchunwon. Gwangjong also mistrusted his eldest son Wang Ju, who was five years old at the time. At the end of the purges, only forty of Taejo's 3,200 meritorious subjects who helped him in unifying the Later Three Kingdoms were still alive. =Later years and death= Gwangjong's tomb. In his later years, Gwangjong's reliance on Buddhism increased. In 968, after a nightmare, he convened a reunion and banned the slaughter of his family. In December 971, an earthquake occurred in Goryeo, and the nobles and the people blamed the king. Gwangjong managed to handle the situation, but a second earthquake occurred in February 972: during this time, he had a nightmare and granted amnesty to prisoners in August. He developed a serious disease in July 975 (fifth month of the Lunar calendar) and died just a few days later at the age of 50. He was given the posthumous name of \\"Hongdoseon-yeolpyeongse sukheon-ui hyoganghye daeseong dae-wang\\" (), while his temple name Gwangjong means \\"shining emperor\\". His tomb, called Heolleung (), is located on the north side of Mount Songak, in Kaepung County, North Korea. The site inspection in 1916 found a severely damaged tomb, but the stairway and the foundation stone are preserved. He was succeeded by his only son Wang Ju, who became the fifth king of Goryeo, Gyeongjong. The reform policies to curb the power of the capital aristocracy were passed down to his successors, but they weren't able to pursue them; as a result, the bureaucracy turned from a meritorious aristocracy to a hereditary class. The law of emancipation of slaves was retracted during the sixth king's, Seongjong, reign. Legacy Gwangjong's bold reform policy weakened the nobles and stabilized the kingship. In addition, the national civil service examination caused the raise of a new wave of political forces, while a new cultural heritage was developed independently by taking inspiration from China. Though Hyejong and Jeongjong established their reigns by relying on strong power bases represented by general Park Sul-hee and uncle Wang Sik-ryeom, respectively, Gwangjong established his own power base,Global World Encyclopedia, Unification of Goryeo. and, in order to restrain the power of wealthy people and influential vassals, he encouraged consanguineous marriages to avoid troubles with maternal relatives. He is regarded as the king who made the most strenuous and energetic efforts to strengthen the kingship in the early Goryeo. His reforms contributed greatly to the formation of a new political order in the newborn kingdom of Goryeo, but they were mainly limited to politics; the restructuring of the local government, and the reorganization of national economy and social system were comparatively weak. He was always wary of the possibility of hostile acts, and killed nobles and relatives recklessly. One of the most influential thinkers of the time was Choe Seungno, the son of a high-ranked official, who strongly opposed Gwangjong's autocracy. He believed that the privileges of the nobility were to be protected, and that having as officials the sons of provincial gentlemen with no power base at the court would put it in danger. Therefore, he condemned Gwangjong for his obsession with Buddhism and public projects, which, according to him, drove the kingdom into debt, and declared him a tyrant for his cruelty.

He was Prince of Novgorod (1168‚Äì1170), of Vladimir-in- Volhynia (1170‚Äì1189, 1189‚Äì1205), and of Halych (Galicia; 1189, 1198/99‚Äì1205). By seizing the throne of Halych, he became the master of all Western Rus‚Äô. In the early 13th century, Byzantine chroniclers applied the imperial title \\"autocrate\\" (Œ±œçœÑŒøŒ∫œÅŒ¨œÑœâœÅ) to him, but there is no evidence that he assumed it officially. He waged two successful campaigns against the Cumans, from which he returned with many rescued captives. The effect of Roman's victory was, however, undermined by new divisions among the princes of Rus‚Äô. Roman died in a battle with the Poles at the Battle of Zawichost. He founded the Romanovich dynasty, which would rule Vladimir-in-Volhynia and Halych until 1340.  Early years  He was the eldest son of Mstislav Izyaslavich, Prince of Vladimir-in- Volhynia at that time, and Agnes, a daughter of Duke Boles≈Çaw III of Poland. Mstislav, who had previously occupied Kiev, sent Roman to Novgorod on 14 April 1168, after the Novgorodians had expelled their prince, Svyatoslav IV Rostislavich. However, Svyatoslav's brothers the princes of Smolensk, and Prince Andrey Yuryevich of Vladimir, who had supported Svyatoslav's rule in Novgorod, spent the rest of the year conspiring and forming alliances against Mstislav. After Mstislav died in August 1170, the Novgorodians expelled Roman and invited Andrey to be prince. Andrey sent Ryurik Rostislavich to rule Novgorod.  Prince of Vladimir-in-Volhynia  When his father died, Roman was bequeathed the Principality of Vladimir-in-Volhynia. He subdued the Yotvingians and harnessed the captives to pull the plows on his estates instead of oxen. He married Predslava Ryurikovna, a daughter of Ryurik Rostislavich, who had followed him in Novgorod. Their eldest daughter, Fedora Romanovna, was married to Vasilko Vladimirovich, a grandson of Prince Yaroslav Volodimerovich Osmomysl of Halych, but Vasilko later repudiated her. Following the death of Yaroslav Osmomysl on 1 October 1187, trouble began in the Principality of Halych, due to the strife between his two sons, Oleg and Vladimir. Roman urged the Galicians to evict Vladimir and make himself their prince, but they failed to either expel or kill Vladimir. However, when the Galicians threatened to kill his wife, Vladimir took her and fled to King B√©la III of Hungary (1172‚Äì1196). According to a late chronicle, Oleg was appointed by Duke Casimir II of Poland (1177‚Äì1194) to rule the Principality of Halych, but the Galicians poisoned him and invited Roman to be their prince. When accepting their offer, Roman gave his patrimony of Vladimir-in-Volhynia to his brother, Vsevolod Mstislavich. But B√©la marched against Roman, intending to reinstate Vladimir, and the Hungarians seized the principality. Instead of returning Halych to Vladimir, B√©la proclaimed his own son, Andrew, its ruler. Roman was forced to flee to Vladimir-in-Volhynia, but Vsevolod refused him entry. He therefore went to the Poles for help, but when they refused as well. Finally Roman rode to his father-in-law, Ryurik Rostislavich, in Belgorod and solicited military aid from him. Nonetheless, the Hungarian troops repelled his attack. Ryurik did help Roman drive his brother Vsevolod out of Vladimir- in-Volhynia and reclaim his patrimony. Meanwhile, Vladimir succeeded in escaping from his dungeon in Hungary, and in 1190 Duke Casimir II sent Polish troops to the Principality of Halych to support his claims. At the approach of the expedition, the boyars rose up against the Hungarians and expelled the unpopular Andrew. Vladimir asked his uncle Prince Vsevolod III Yuryevich of Vladimir to support his rule. Vsevolod Yuryevich demanded that all the Rus‚Äô princes, Roman among them, pledge not to challenge Vladimir in Halych, and they agreed. On 17 May 1195, Roman's father-in-lawGrand Prince Ryurik allocated domains in the Kievan lands to the princes in Monomakh's dynasty, and Roman received Torchesk, Trypillia, Korsun, Bohuslav, and Kaniv. Vsevolod Yuryevich, however, threatened to wage war when he learnt of the allocations. Therefore, Roman agreed to relinquish the towns in exchange for comparable domains or a suitable payment in kuny. Ryurik gave the five towns to Vsevolod Yuryevich, who in turn handed over Torchesk to his son-in-law Rostislav, the brother of Roman's wife Predslava. On learning that his brother-in-law had received Torchesk, Roman accused his father-in-law of having contrived to give the town to his son from the very start. Ryurik warned Roman that they could not afford to alienate Vsevolod Yuryevich because all the princes in Monomakh's dynasty recognized him as their senior prince. Roman refused to be mollified and conspired against his father-in-law, turning to Prince Yaroslav II Vsevolodovich of Chernigov, who agreed to join him. When Ryurik learnt that Roman had persuaded Yaroslav to seize Kiev, he informed Vsevolod Yuryevich. Fearing retribution, Roman rode to the Poles, where he was wounded in battle, and he was forced to ask Ryurik Rostislavich for clemency. Metropolitan Nikifor reconciled the two princes, and Ryurik gave Roman the town of Polonyy (southwest of Kamianets) and a district on the Ros‚Äô River. In the autumn of 1196, Roman ordered his lieutenants to use Polonyy as their base for raiding the domains belonging to his father-in-law's brother, Prince David Rostislavich of Smolensk, and son, Prince Rostislav Rurikovich of Torchesk. Ryurik retaliated by sending his nephew, Prince Mstislav Mstislavich of Trepol, to Vladimir Yaroslavich of Halych, instructing him to join Mstislav Mstislavich in attacking Roman's lands. Accordingly, Vladimir and Mstislav razed Roman's district around Peremil, while Rostislav and his forces attacked Roman's district near Kamianets. At about that time, Roman initiated his repudiation his wife Predslava, Ryurik's daughter, and began threatening to confine her to a monastery.  Prince of Halych and Volodymyr-in-Volhynia  In 1198 (or 1199), Vladimir died, creating a political vacuum that a number of claimants were eager to fill. Ryurik could now claim that after the dynasty of Halych became defunct, the territory reverted to the jurisdiction of the prince of Kyiv; the princes of both branches of the Olgovichi (the princes of Chernigov) could argue that their marriage ties with the defunct dynasty gave them the right to rule Halych; and the Hungarians had already made a bid for the domain ten years earlier. The Galicians asked Ryurik for his son Rostislav, but Roman rode to Duke Leszek I of Poland (1194‚Äì1227), promising to be at his beck and call if the Polish ruler helped him win Halych. When the citizens refused to welcome Roman, Leszek besieged the principality, and after capturing it he forced its residents to accept Roman as prince. Roman promised to be subservient to the duke of Poland and to live in peace with his new subjects. Roman turned his attention to the Cumans, who were threatening Byzantine interests in the Balkan Peninsula, and agreed to come to the aid of Emperor Alexios III Angelos (1195‚Äì1203). This dealt aa severe blow to the nomads. In 1200, Roman married the Byzantine princess Anna-Euphrosyne, daughter of Emperor Isaac II Angelos. This tie with Byzantium helped stabilize Galicia's relations with the Rus‚Äô population of the Lower Dniester and Lower Danube.Alexander V. Maiorov, The Alliance between Byzantium and Rus‚Äô Before the Conquest of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204,Russian History, Volume 42, Issue 3, pages 272 ‚Äì 303. Publication Year : 2015 Shortly thereafter, Roman began wreaking havoc on domains belonging to Ryurik Rostislavich and other princes. In 1201, Ryurik summoned the Olgovichi to campaign against Roman. Roman pre-empted their attack by rallying the troops of his principality; the Monomashichi and the Black Caps also joined him. The Kievans opened the gates of the podol‚Äô to Roman. He forced Ryurik and the Olgovichi to capitulate; he gave Kiev, with the consent of Vsevolod III Yuryevich, to Prince Ingvar Yaroslavich of Lutsk. However, Ryurik and the Olgovichi re-captured Kiev on 2 January 1203. Roman asked Vsevolod to broker peace with the Olgovichi, and after he had done the same, on 16 February 1203 he marched against Ryurik in Ovruch. Ryurik submitted to Roman and Vsevolod and promised to sever relations with the Olgovichi and the Cumans. Roman also advised him to ask Vsevolod to reinstate him in Kiev and promised to support his request. Consequently, Vsevolod forgave Ryurik and reappointed him to the town. That winter Ryurik, Roman, and other princes attacked the Cumans and took many captives. They later met at Trypillia to allocate domains in accordance with the services that each prince had rendered in the defense of Rus‚Äô. But they quarreled, and Roman seized Ryurik, sent him to Kiev, and had him tonsured as a monk. He also forced Ryurik's wife Anna and daughter Predslava‚Äîhis own wife whom he had repudiated‚Äîinto a convent; and he took Ryurik's sons Rostislav and Vladimir Rurikovich with him to Halych. Roman of Halych receives an ambassador from Pope Innocent III as imagined by Nikolai Nevrev Meanwhile, relations between Roman and Duke Leszek I of Poland had deteriorated for both religious and personal reasons. Leszek was a devout Roman Catholic, and it was probably at his suggestion that Pope Innocent III sent his envoys to Roman in 1204, urging him to accept Roman Catholicism and promising to place him under the protection of St Peter‚Äôs sword. Roman‚Äôs answer, as recorded in the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç Chronicle, was characteristic enough: pointing to his own sword, he asked the envoys, ‚ÄúIs the Pope‚Äôs sword similar to mine? So long as I carry mine, I need no other.‚Äù Leszek and his brother Duke Konrad I of Masovia undertook a sudden campaign against Roman, who was caught unaware and killed in the first battle at Zawichost. According to another version of the story, Roman wanted to expand his realm at the expense of Poland and died in an ambush while entering Polish territory.This desire to extend the boundaries of an already extensive realm proved to be the cause of his undoing. In 1205, while crossing into Polish territory, Roman was killed in an ambush. Orest Subtelny, Ukraine: a history, University of Toronto Press, 2000, p. 61. Marriage and children 1\\\\.

Duckworth, who won his cricketing fame as a wicket-keeper, was born and died in Warrington, Lancashire, and joined Lancashire in 1922. He played his first game for the county in 1923 and his last in 1938 and went on to become a member of the Lancashire committee. 1928 was his best season, with him taking 77 catches and 30 stumpings, and this earned him the accolade of being one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1929. He played 24 Test matches for England, but as a wicket-keeper he was in direct competition in his later years with Les Ames, who was a much better batsman. He was awarded a benefit in 1934, which raised ¬£1,257. He was reputed to have the loudest shout of appeal of any cricketer of his time. Duckworth's total of 925 dismissals for Lancashire is a record for the county. After retirement, Duckworth was a journalist and a broadcaster on both cricket and rugby league. He also acted as a cricket tour organiser and as baggage master and scorer on Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tours. A peanut shaped roundabout in his home town Warrington has been named after him. Duckworth's Roundabout is at Birchwood Way (A574) and Oakwood Gate. Duckworth was the nephew of the rugby league footballer for Warrington, Jack Duckworth.

The album is considered by many to be a defining emo album of the second wave, otherwise known as Midwest emo. It has also been called the missing link between post-hardcore and the nascent emo genre. Diary was remastered and reissued in 2009, with bonus tracks \\"8\\" and \\"9\\" from their 1993 7-inch Thief, Steal Me a Peach and newly written liner notes. Overview The songlist started with six tracks written by Thief, Steal Me a Peach, a project started when bassist Nate Mendel went on tour with his other project Christ on a Crutch, and drummer William Goldsmith invited his friend Jeremy Enigk to jam with him and guitarist and then singer Dan Hoerner. The first songs afterwards had titles regarding their order in composing - \\"Seven\\", \\"8\\" and \\"9\\", though only the first appeared on Diary - and then two different numbers, \\"47\\" and \\"48\\". The album was released on CD, vinyl and cassette. The vinyl has been released in three limited edition pressings, all of which are out of print. The first was a multi-colored splatter vinyl, released on \\"Glitterhouse Records\\" in Germany. The second was a black vinyl pressing on Sub Pop. A repress followed on green vinyl (and possibly a second black pressing), but the label for this second pressing states \\"Edition II\\" under the Sub Pop logo. All three vinyl pressings are missing 3 songs that are present on the CD, possibly due to the time constraints of vinyl, as the album clocks in at 53 minutes. The missing songs are \\"Round\\", \\"48\\" and \\"Grendel\\". The 2009 double LP re-issue contains all 11 songs from the original album, and two bonus tracks. The artwork of the album was almost entirely done by Chris Thompson. However, the \\"butterfly\\" drawing on the album's booklet was created by Nate Mendel's father. The album cover features the popular children's toy Little People. Legacy The album was different from those released by popular Seattle grunge bands at the time. Its melodic but urgent sound has had a clear mark on future emo groups. Despite being the only album by the band to never chart, it has since become the seventh best selling album released on Sub Pop, having sold more than 231,000 copies.

The cheese is still made in the traditional manner by the Benedictine monks of the Abbaye Notre-Dame de Belloc, in the commune of Belloc in the Ari√®ge department of southwestern France. Production of this Ossau-Iraty cheese is regulated by A.O.C. laws. Abbaye is produced from the milk of a centuries-old breed of red- nosed Manech ewes, particular to the Basque region, delivered by farms neighboring Belloc Abbey. It is believed that these Benedictine monks were the first to teach shepherds from the Basque region how to make cheese many centuries ago. Abbaye de Belloc has a pleasantly nutty and complex flavor that is characteristic of Basque, and is made in a 5 kg fat wheel with a natural, crusty, brownish colored rind with patches of red, orange and yellow. This semi-firm cheese has a dense, rich and creamy texture and a distinctive lanolin aroma. Careful attention under the correct maturing conditions accentuates this cheese's rich, caramelized flavors, which sometime resemble burnt caramel, that can make Abbaye de Belloc so addictive. It pairs particularly well with Pinot Noir, as it is mild enough not to overwhelm the subtleties of this delicate varietal, but also has sufficient complexity to stand up to the bolder flavors of a Syrah/Shiraz.

She was a sister of King Constantine I of Greece and a first cousin of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. Born as a princess of Greece and Denmark, she was educated in Athens by private tutors. Her father instilled in her a great love for Greece and throughout her life, she remained a fervent patriot. She married Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia, her first cousin once removed, who courted her for five years. The wedding took place in 1900 in Corfu. The couple settled in St. Petersburg and they had two daughters: Princesses Nina (1901 -1974) and Xenia of Russia (1903 -1965). Grand Duke George Mikhailovich had a house built for her in Crimea and he was a devoted father and husband, but the marriage was unhappy. Princess Maria, known upon her marriage as Grand Duchess Maria Georgievna of Russia, neither got to love her husband nor her adopted country. Longing for her native Greece, she never adapted to life in Russia. Over the years, she became estranged from her husband taking any opportunity to spend time abroad. At the outbreak of World War I, she was vacationing in England with her daughters and chose not to return to Russia. During the conflict, she was a patron of three military hospitals in Harrogate, which she financed generously. Her husband was trapped in Russia after the revolution and he was shot by the Bolsheviks with several other Romanov relatives in January 1919. In her widowhood, deprived of her Russian income, Princess Maria faced serious financial difficulties. She returned to live in Greece with her daughters in 1920. There, she began a relationship with Admiral Perikles Ioannidis, who had been the commander of the ship that she took at her return to Athens. They were married in 1922. The proclamation of the Second Hellenic Republic in 1924, sent her into exile. The princess returned to live in Britain for a couple of years and she settled in Rome in 1926 with her second husband. She lived in Italy for over a decade until the outbreak of the Greco-Italian War in 1940 forced her to return to her native Greece. She was in poor health and was cared for by her nephew King Paul of Greece and his wife Frederica. She died, as the Greek royal family was about to leave for exile. She left a book of memoirs, published posthumously by her grandchildren with the title A Romanov Diary.  Early life Princess Princess Maria of Greece and Denmark with her parents and siblings.

The Greek royal family was not wealthy by royal standards and they lived with simplicity. Throughout the year, following a regular pattern, they moved around their different properties. They began the year at the Royal Palace in Athens. On Sundays, they often visited Themistocles, the King's small estate at the entrance of the port of Piraeus.Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 6 In the spring, they moved to Mon Repos, the family royal villa on the island of Corfu. During April, they toured the Greek provinces, choosing a different region each year. In the summer, the Greek royal family stayed in Tatoi, in the mountains north of Athens, until mid-October before returning to the Royal Palace for the winter.Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 9Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diaryp. 9 King George was a strict and demanding father, but contrary to the general approach of the time, he believed in happy rambunctious children. Maria and her siblings were mischievous, playing pranks, even taking \\"bike rides\\" through the long corridors of the Royal palace, sometimes led by the King himself.

In addition, she was taught court etiquette, Orthodox religion, drawing, painting, music, dancing and learned to play the piano. She also practiced horse riding, gymnastics and took singing lessons.Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 5 As Maria's eldest brothers were already occupied by their studies, she grew up closer to her sister Alexandra and her brother Nicholas, who preceded her in age. She was short and dark, less pretty than her sister but more vivacious.King & Wilson, The Romanovs Adrift, p. 169 Family reunions took her many times abroad.

She became lifelong friends with two of her cousins: Grand Duchess Xenia of Russia and Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom. A Princess of Greece Princess Maria of Greece and Denmark in her youth. King George I instilled in his offspring a great love for Greece. He used to tell them: \\"Never forget that you are strangers among the Greeks, and make sure that they never remember\\". As a consequence, she would remain all her life intensely Greek. As a child, she cried when she was told she belonged to a foreign dynasty and had no Greek blood. As an adult, she always looked at Athens as her home. In her book of memoirs, she described herself as: \\" A true daughter of Greece\\". The popular desire to unite all Greeks within a single territory (Megali Idea) led to a revolt in Crete against the Turkish rule.Van der Kiste, Kings of the Hellens: The Greek Kings 1863‚Äì1974, p. 55 In February 1897, King George sent his son, Prince George, to take possession of the island. To support the Cretan cause Greek troops crossed the Macedonian border and Abdul Hamid II declared war. During the conflict, Queen Olga organized a military hospital and Princess Maria served as a nurse. The Greco-Turkish War of 1897 went badly for the ill-prepared Greeks.Van der Kiste, Kings of the Hellens: The Greek Kings 1863‚Äì1974, p. 57 They were forced to give up Crete to international administration, and agree to minor territorial concessions in favor of the Turks and to a monetary indemnity.Van der Kiste, Kings of the Hellens: The Greek Kings 1863‚Äì1974, p. 58 Since her sister Alexandra's marriage in 1889, Princess Maria became her father's favorite child and constant companion.Zeepvat, A True Daughter of Greece: Princess Marie of Greece.

A church was later built on the site of the assassination attempt.  A Russian marriage Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia and Princes Marie of Greece, 1896. Princess Maria wanted to spend her entire life in Greece instead of following the traditional path of Princesses of her time that had to marry a foreign prince and move abroad.Zeepvat, A True Daughter of Greece: Princess Marie of Greece. Part 1: A Marriage of Inconvenience, p. 53 In her late teens, she fell in love with a Greek commoner, but her parents did not allow her to contract an unequal union. She just turned twenty years old when, in April 1896, during the Olympics games held in Athens, King Alexander I of Serbia (last representative of the Obrenoviƒá dynasty) proposed to her.Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 51 Princess Maria found King Alexander too ugly and rejected him. Since her childhood, Princess Maria of Greece had visited Russia many times with her mother, who remained very attached to her native country. They usually stayed at Pavlovsk Palace with Princess Maria's maternal grandmother, Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna. While in Russia, in summer 1894, for the wedding of her cousin Grand Duchess Xenia to Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich, Princess Maria became smitten with the groom's brother, Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia, who was her mother's first cousin. However, he had no interest in her then. In a subsequent visit to Russia in the autumn of 1895, they were reunited at a Court Ball. This time she found him too old and boring and was no longer interested. On the other hand, he fell in love with her and asked to marry him. She turned him down, to the dismay of Maria's mother, Queen Olga, who was in favor of a Russian marriage for her daughter. In spring 1896, Grand Duke George Mikhailovich arrived in Athens and proposed while they were playing billiards.King & Hall, Imperial Crimea, p. 365 She accepted him and the engagement was officially announced on 4 April 1896. The wedding was to take place a few months later in the summer. However, she had a change of heart and after putting off the wedding date twice, she broke off the engagement in October. For five years, Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia persisted in his intention. Twice a year, he proposed to Princess Maria who continued refusing him. Tsar Nicholas II finally intervened, telling the grand duke to make only one more attempt and give up. George Mikhailovich arrived in Greece in spring 1900.Zeepvat, A True Daughter of Greece: Princess Marie of Greece. Part 1: A Marriage of Inconvenience, p. 54 This time, under pressure from her family, the Greek princess finally accepted his proposal, yet reluctantly.Korneva & Cheboksarova, Russia & Europe, p. 292 She made clear that for her it was a marriage of convenience and that her feelings were not going to change.King & Wilson, The Romanovs Adrift, p. 157 Before she had a change of heart, Queen Olga hurried the wedding. The marriage took place in Greece at the church of the old Venetian fortress in Corfu on 12 May [O.S. 30 April] 1900.Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 69Hall & Be√©che, The Romanovs, p. 264 It was a relatively simple ceremony with the reception held at the Greek Royal family residence in Corfu: Mon Repos.

Princess Maria of Greece, known in Russia as Grand Duchess Maria Georgievna of Russia, was welcomed by the Romanovs as one of their own. Her mother, Queen Olga of Greece, was a Russian Grand Duchess by birth, a first cousin of Tsar Alexander III of Russia. Maria's father, King George of Greece, was Empress Maria Feodorvna's favorite brother. Maria was a first cousin of Tsar Nicholas II, who she had known all her life.Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 79 Grand Duchess Maria and her husband settled in apartments located within the New Michael Palace on the Palace Quay in Saint Petersburg, the household of her father-in-law, Grand Duke Michael Nicholaievich.Korneva & Cheboksarova, Russia & Europe, p. 295King & Hall, Imperial Crimea, p. 366 They shared the large palace with the Grand Duke's widowed father and two unmarried brothers: Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich, and Grand Duke Sergei Mihailovich, to whom Maria Gerogievna became particularly close.Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 77Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 80 The family had Milkhailovkoye near Peterhof as their summer country retreat. Grand Duke George Mikhailovich had an injury in one leg in his youth, which curtailed the active military career he would have wanted; he occupied his time as director of the Alexander III museum where he moved his large numismatic collection. Two days after Empress Alexandra Feodorovna gave birth to her fourth daughter, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nicolaievna, Grand Duchess Maria Georgievna gave birth to her first child, Princess Nina Georgievna on 20 June [7 June] 1901.Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 86 Two years, two months and two days later on 22 August 1903, she had her second daughter and last child Princess Xenia Georgievna.Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 102 Shortly after Xenia's birth, Grand Duchess Maria's father in law became paralyzed by a stroke and moved permanently to the south of France to recover. During the years living in Russia (1900-1914), Grand Duchess Maria traveled frequently to the South of France, Denmark, England, Germany, Italy and yearly to her native Greece.Zeepvat, A True Daughter of Greece: Princess Marie of Greece. Part 2: From Harax to Harrogate, and beyond, p. 39 In the summer of 1900, Maria Georgievna visited Crimea with her husband. It was there, in a piece of land Grand Duke George had bought in the 1890s near Ai-Todor, on a high cliff above the sea, that the couple decided to build their residence.Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 75 They commissioned the construction to Nikolay Petrovich Krasnov, a Russian architect who had built the palace of Dulber between 1895 and 1897 for Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich, and who would build the white Palace at Livadia for Tsar Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra between (1910-1911).King & Hall, Imperial Crimea, p. 367 =Harax= Grand Duchess Maria Georgievna and her husband Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia with their two daughters. 1908 As Grand Duchess Maria Georgievna was very fond of everything English, the villa was constructed in the English style with local limestone, but they gave the property a Greek name, Harax, the fortress, in memory of an ancient fortress that once stood on the tip of Ai-Todor. The couple was very involved in the planning as both were skillful artists. Grand Duchess Maria sketched the exterior elevations and draw floor plans while Grand Duke George painted renderings in watercolors and pen and ink sketches.King & Hall, Imperial Crimea, p. 368 Harax, the villa of Grand Duchess Maria Georgievna and her husband in Crimea, constructed in the English style. 1913. Construction took place between 1905 and 1907.King & Hall, Imperial Crimea, p. 370Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 122 Harax, encompassing 46 rooms, lay upon a gray stone foundation extending to the surrounding terraces in a cruciform plan.King & Hall, Imperial Crimea, p. 371 The two-story house, overlooking the Black sea with a red-tiled roof and dotted with chimneys, was decorated by the Grand Duchess with English furniture, silverware, textiles, and wallpaper all imported from England.King & Hall, Imperial Crimea, p. 372 The property was later expanded adding a farm, a playhouse for their daughters, housing for their staff's family and a church in 1908.King & Hall, Imperial Crimea, p. 374-376 Husband and wife both took on gardening with enthusiasm working on the surrounding park. As Harax was on walking distance from Livadia Palace, the residence in Crimea of Tsar Nicholas II and his immediate family, the Tsar and his children were frequent visitors.King & Hall, Imperial Crimea, p. 385 For seven years the Grand Duke and his wife led a quiet life in Crimea, returning to St Petersburg in the winter for the social season at the Imperial capital.Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 111 With a poor command of Russian, Grand Duchess Maria spoke in French with her husband and in English with her daughters. Princess Nina, the eldest was described by Baroness Agnes de Stoeckel as \\"dark, calm and indolent\\" while Xenia, the youngest was \\"blond, vivacious and full of life\\". Both girls were very much doted on by their parents. Grand Duchess Maria hired an English nanny to educate them. On 18 March 1913, King George I was assassinated in Thessalonica, a city that Greece had seized on during the First Balkan War.Van der Kiste, Kings of the Hellens: The Greek Kings 1863‚Äì1974, p. 74Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 138 For Maria Georgieva, who had been so close to her father it was a terrible blow.Zeepvat, A True Daughter of Greece: Princess Marie of Greece. Part 2: From Harax to Harrogate, and beyond, p. 40 For many weeks, she was inconsolable. A few weeks later, still grieving, she had to take part in the ceremonies which marked the tercentenary of the Romanov dynasty. By 1914 the relationship between the Grand Duchess and her husband had deteriorated.Korneva & Cheboksarova, Russia & Europe, p. 296Zeepvat, A True Daughter of Greece: Princess Marie of Greece. Part 2: From Harax to Harrogate, and beyond, p. 38 Grand Duke George was a devoted father and husband, but the Grand Duchess never fell in love with him.Zeepvat, The Camera and the Tsars, p. 52 She never liked Russia either and eventually became estranged from her husband.Zeepvat, A True Daughter of Greece: Princess Marie of Greece. Part 2: From Harax to Harrogate, and beyond, p. 41  War and Revolution Grand Duchess Maria Georgievna with her two daughters. 1917. In the summer of 1914, the Grand Duchess left Russia with her two daughters and her lady- in waiting, the Baroness Stoeckl for England to improve her daughter Xenia's frail health with the mineral waters of the Spa town of Harrogate, where they had been three times before.Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 146 In reality, she wanted a trial separation from her husband. The Grand Duke accompanied them to Warsaw in July. They would never see each other again.Stoeckl, Not All Vanity, p. 145 After a stay at the Claridge's Hotel, the Princess moved to Harrogate, where Grand Duke George Mikhailovich was going to join them a few weeks later. However, the outbreak of World War I on 28 July 1914 thwarted their plans. Grand Duke George was forced to cancel his trip as he had to resume his duties in the Tsarist army. For her part, Grand Duchess Maria declined the chance to rush back to Russia with her aunt the Empress Maria Feodorovna, who was in London that summer.Zeepvat, A True Daughter of Greece: Princess Marie of Greece. Part 2: From Harax to Harrogate, and beyond, p. 42Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 147 Instead, the Grand Duchess decided to extend her stay in the United Kingdom with her daughters and later used the dangers involved in a trip back during wartime in not attempting a return to Russia.Zeepvat, A True Daughter of Greece: Princess Marie of Greece. Part 2: From Harax to Harrogate, and beyond, p. 45 Determine to help with the war of the Triple Entente against the Central Powers, Grand Duchess Maria founded a small military hospital N 2 in Harrogate.Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 148 Aimed at British and Canadian naval men wounded in the war. She undertook a Red Cross nursing course and already had experience of army medical service as a young princess in Greece, nursing patients herself.Zeepvat, The Camera and the Tsars, p. 201 This institution was so successful that by 1915 the Grand Duchess eventually created two other hospitals: N 3 and a home for convalescent patients in Harrogate.Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 151 During the four years of the war, more than 1200 patients were treated there.Zeepvat, A True Daughter of Greece: Princess Marie of Greece. Part 2: From Harax to Harrogate, and beyond, p. 44 Impressed by her work, her cousin, King George V, conferred her the Royal Red Cross in July 1915. During the war years, Grand Duchess Maria lived with her daughters in Harrogate until July 1916 when they moved to a large mansion in Grosvenor Square in London. Very close to the British Royal Family, she went to Marlborough House almost every evening to dine and play cards with Queen Alexandra. Grand Duchess Maria also regularly visited her cousin, Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom, her close friend since childhood. She continued to go to Harrogate frequently to be in charge of her hospitals. The outbreak of the Russian Revolution in 1917 disrupted the daily life of Grand Duchess Maria and her daughters, who ceased to receive income from St. Petersburg.Zeepvat, A True Daughter of Greece: Princess Marie of Greece. Part 2: From Harax to Harrogate, and beyond, p. 46 Unable to subsidize any longer the hospitals she patronized, the Grand Duchess entrusted them to the protection of her aunt Queen Alexandra. At the request of her patients, however, she remained the director until the end of the war. Her reduced financial circumstances forced Grand Duchess Maria to move to a smaller residence next to Regent's Park. It was though the financial support of her future sister-in-law, the wealthy American Nancy Leeds, that the Grand Duchess was able to maintain her finances afloat. In 1918, Grand Duke George Mikhailovich was arrested by the Bolsheviks as he sought to emigrate to Britain. Alarmed with the fate of her husband, Maria Gerogievna made many efforts to obtain her husband's release, along with others of her Russian relatives. Through the Danish Embassy, she tried to obtain their freedom in return for ¬£50,000 without success.Hall, Danish efforts to Help the Imprisoned Romanovs, p. 39Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 232 After several months of uncertainty, the Grand Duke was finally shot on January 30, 1919, at the Peter and Paul Fortress by the Bolsheviks. Along with her husband, Maria lost her brother-in-law Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich, her former brother-in-law Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich and her younger maternal uncle, Grand Duke Dimitri Constantinovich.Zeepvat, A True Daughter of Greece: Princess Marie of Greece. Part 2: From Harax to Harrogate, and beyond, p. 47  A Greek marriage  Queen Olga, Princess Maria of Greece and her second husband Admiral Ioannides. In her widowhood, Princess Maria of Greece reverted to her original name and title and her focus shifted to her own family. At the outbreak of World War I, as Greece had been weakened by the Balkan Wars, King Constantine opted for his country's neutrality. Both the Kaiser, on one side, and the British and the French, on the other, derided him for it. His prime minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, who wanted Greece to enter the conflict on the side of the allies, clashed with the king.Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diaryp. 182 In order to force the Greeks to join the allied cause, the French bombarded Athens and demanded King Constantine's departure. He was forced to leave the country and on June 10, 1917, he was replaced as a king by his second son Alexander. Greece entered the war on the side of the allies while the Greek royal family left for exile in Switzerland with the sole exception of King Alexander. With the tumultuous political situation in Greece, Princess Maria could not count on the support of her relatives. While on a visit to Paris, Princess Maria met her nephew Alexander who Venizelos kept isolated from the Greek Royal family. King Alexander died in October 1920, following an infection from a monkey bite, and a plebiscite restored King Constantine I on the throne.Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diaryp. 239 - 240 Princess Maria and her two daughters then joined King Constantine and the Greek Royal family in Italy, where the small group boarded a ship of the Hellenic Navy towards Corfu. Then, members of the royal family continue their journey aboard the destroyer Ierax, which took them to Athens. During this trip, Princess Maria met the commander of the ship, Admiral Perikles Ioannidis. Widowed and determined to end her days with \\"Greek blood\\", the princess was smitten with the Greek Admiral. Five year her junior, Ioannidis had just spent three years in Venizelist jails because of his support for the monarchy. Back in Greece, Maria settled in Athens. She was much loved by the royal family, even winning the affection of the wife of the Diadochos George, Princess Elizabeth of Romania, whose relationship with the rest of her in-laws was difficult.Mateos Sainz de Medrano, La Familia de la Reina Sofia\\", p. 336 On the other hand, Princess Maria's relationship with her daughters was strained. The princesses resented that their mother had kept them away from their father during the war. That they never were able to see him again, as Grand Duke George Mikhailovich had been killed during the Russian Revolution, only increased their resentment and they disapproved of their mother's relationship with Ioannidis. In part to distance themselves from their mother, both daughters married early. In 1921, 17-year-old, Princess Xenia married William Bateman Leeds, Jr., son of Nancy Leeds. Princess Nina married in London in September 1922. The same month King Constantine had to abdicate after Greece lost the Greco-Turkish War of 1919‚Äì1922. Princess Maria's eldest nephew succeeded him as King George II of Greece on 27 September 1922. Three months later, despite her daughters' opposition, Princess Maria married Admiral Pericles Ioannides on 16 December 1922 in Wiesbaden, Germany.Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diary p. 253  A wandering life  Helena (sitting in front). Standing in the back: Princess Irene, Prince Christopher, Admiral Ioannides and Paul of Greece . After a honeymoon in Frankfurt and Munich Princess Maria of Greece and her second husband returned to Athens. They left Greece at the time of the proclamation of the Second Hellenic Republic in 1924. The couple moved to London to the house the Princess had in Regent's Park where they lived for a couple of years.Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diaryp. 254 The Greek Princess devoted herself to drawing and she made a series of whimsical illustrations in color of exotic people and animals that she called \\"Katoufs\\" \\"making a face\\" in Greek.Chavchavadze, The Artistic Legacy of Two Grand Mothers, p. 61 She published her drawing as a children's book in 1925 with rhymes written by Princess Maria Troubetzkoy, n√©e Rodzyanko (1877‚Äì1958).Chavchavadze, The Artistic Legacy of Two Grand Mothers, p. 54 The two women dedicated the book to their common grandson, Prince David Chavchavadze. Princess Maria was Queen Alexandra's favorite niece and she was her constant companion during the Queen's last years at Sandringham. After her two daughters had moved to the United States and her aunt Queen Alexandra had died, Princess Maria and her husband moved to Rome in 1926.Marie Georgievna, Grand Duchess of Russia, A Romanov Diaryp. 257Chavchavadze, The Artistic Legacy of Two Grand Mothers, p. 57 Many members of the Greek royal family were also living in Italy. The Princess acquired a residence, the Villa Attica, located on via Antonio-Bertoloni. The couple followed a relatively simple existence, and Princess Maria divided her time between gardening and the writing of her memoirs, published years later by her grandchildren. Maria was an inveterate backgammon player while her husband carefully monitored their expenses. In 1933, she visited the United States for a couple of months to see her daughters and two grandchildren staying on Long Island.Chavchavadze, The Artistic Legacy of Two Grand Mothers, p. 55 Later life Grand Duchess Maria Georgievna died in her native Athens during the Greco-Italian War (28 October 1940 ‚Äì 30 April 1941) Her daughter Xenia lived for years in Long Island and was for a time married to millionaire William Leeds, son of Nancy Stewart Worthington Leeds and the stepson of Maria's brother Prince Christopher. She took in for a few months a woman later found to be an impostor, Anna Anderson. Anderson fraudulently claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, the youngest daughter of her cousin, Emperor Nicholas II, and was forced to leave Xenia's house at the demand of William Leeds. Grand Duchess George never recognized Anderson.

It features a stronger dub and reggae influence than on any other Meat Beat Manifesto album. The first disc is the group's standard fare, a highly energetic and densely packed collection of songs that melds a variety of genres and makes heavy use of sampling. The second disc is far more experimental in nature, composed of lengthier pieces that incorporate more ambient textures and drones and fewer samples or defined song structures. Subliminal Sandwich was composed during Meat Beat Manifesto's 1993 tour supporting the Satyricon album and would have been released in 1994 or 1995 if not for legal tangles with the band's Belgian label Play It Again Sam.

It highlights various Warhol superstars, in addition to being the film debuts of both Jackie Curtis and Candy Darling. Also appearing are Geraldine Smith as Joe's wife and Patti D'Arbanville as her lover. Flesh was first shown at the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre at 152 Bleecker Street, Manhattan, New York City on September 26, 1968. Flesh is the first film of the \\"Paul Morrissey Trilogy\\" produced by Andy Warhol. The other films in the trilogy include Trash and Heat. All three have gained a cult following and are noted examples of the ideals and ideology of the time period. Plot As the film begins, Geri ejects Joe from their bed and insists he go out on the streets to make some money for her girlfriend's abortion. This leads to Joe's various encounters with clients, including an artist who wishes to draw Joe, played by Maurice Braddell, Louis Waldon as a gymnast, and John Christian. Scenes filmed on the streets of New York City show Joe spending time with other hustlers, one of whom is played by his real life brother, and teaching the tricks of the trade to the new hustler, played by Barry Brown. The film includes a scene of Joe interacting with his real life one-year-old son. Flesh concludes with Joe in bed with Geraldine Smith and Patti D'Arbanville. The women strip Joe and begin to get intimate with each other. In turn, Joe gets bored and falls asleep.

The device is situated in a drift mine shaft in the old KamiokaNDE cavity in the Japanese Alps. The site is surrounded by 53 Japanese commercial nuclear reactors. Nuclear reactors produce electron antineutrinos (\\\\bar{ u}_e) during the decay of radioactive fission products in the nuclear fuel. Like the intensity of light from a light bulb or a distant star, the isotropically- emitted \\\\bar{ u}_e flux decreases at 1/R2 per increasing distance R from the reactor. The device is sensitive up to an estimated 25% of antineutrinos from nuclear reactors that exceed the threshold energy of 1.8 megaelectronvolts (MeV) and thus produces a signal in the detector. If neutrinos have mass, they may oscillate into flavors that an experiment may not detect, leading to a further dimming, or \\"disappearance,\\" of the electron antineutrinos. KamLAND is located at an average flux-weighted distance of approximately 180 kilometers from the reactors, which makes it sensitive to the mixing of neutrinos associated with large mixing angle (LMA) solutions to the solar neutrino problem. KamLAND Detector The KamLAND detector's outer layer consists of an 18 meter-diameter stainless steel containment vessel with an inner lining of 1,879 photo-multiplier tubes (1325 17\\" and 554 20\\" PMTs). Photocathode coverage is 34%. Its second, inner layer consists of a -diameter nylon balloon filled with a liquid scintillator composed of 1,000 metric tons of mineral oil, benzene, and fluorescent chemicals. Non-scintillating, highly purified oil provides buoyancy for the balloon and acts as a buffer to keep the balloon away from the photo-multiplier tubes; the oil also shields against external radiation. A 3.2 kiloton cylindrical water Cherenkov detector surrounds the containment vessel, acting as a muon veto counter and providing shielding from cosmic rays and radioactivity from the surrounding rock. Electron antineutrinos () are detected through the Inverse beta decay reaction \\\\bar{ u}_e + p \\\\to e^+ + n, which has a 1.8 MeV \\\\bar{ u}_e energy threshold. The prompt scintillation light from the positron (e^+) gives an estimate of the incident antineutrino energy, E_{ u} = E_{prompt} + \\\\+ 0.9 MeV , where E_{prompt}is the prompt event energy including the positron kinetic energy and the e^+e^- annihilation energy. The quantity <E_n> is the average neutron recoil energy, which is only a few tens of kiloelectronvolts (keV). The neutron is captured on hydrogen approximately 200 microseconds (Œºs) later, emitting a characteristic ray. This delayed-coincidence signature is a very powerful tool for distinguishing antineutrinos from backgrounds produced by other particles. To compensate for the loss in \\\\bar{ u}_e flux due to the long baseline, KamLAND has a much larger detection volume compared to earlier devices. The KamLAND detector uses a 1,000-metric-ton detection mass, which is over twice the size of similar detectors, such as Borexino. However, the increased volume of the detector also demands more shielding from cosmic rays, requiring the detector be placed underground. As part of the Kamland-Zen double beta decay search, a balloon of scintillator with 320 kg of dissolved xenon was suspended in the center of the detector in 2011. A cleaner rebuilt balloon is planned with additional xenon. KamLAND-PICO is a planned project that will install the PICO-LON detector in KamLand to search for dark matter. PICO-LON is a radiopure NaI(Tl) crystal that observes inelastic WIMP-nucleus scattering. Improvements to the detector are planned, adding light collecting mirrors and PMTs with higher quantum efficiency. Results =Neutrino oscillation= KamLAND started to collect data on January 17, 2002. First results were reported using only 145 days of data. Without neutrino oscillation, events were expected, however, only 54 events were observed. KamLAND confirmed this result with a 515-day data sample, 365.2 events were predicted in the absence of oscillation, and 258 events were observed. These results established antineutrino disappearance at high significance. The KamLAND detector not only counts the antineutrino rate, but also measures their energy. The shape of this energy spectrum carries additional information that can be used to investigate neutrino oscillation hypotheses. Statistical analyses in 2005 show the spectrum distortion is inconsistent with the no- oscillation hypothesis and two alternative disappearance mechanisms, namely the neutrino decay and de-coherence models. It is consistent with 2-neutrino oscillation and a fit provides the values for the Œîm2 and Œ∏ parameters. Since KamLAND measures Œîm2 most precisely and the solar experiments exceed KamLAND's ability to measure Œ∏, the most precise oscillation parameters are obtained in combination with solar results. Such a combined fit gives \\\\Delta{m^2} = 7.9^{+0.6}_{-0.5} \\\\cdot 10^{-5} \\\\text{eV}^2 and \\\\tan^2\\\\theta = 0.40^{+0.10}_{-0.07} , the best neutrino oscillation parameter determination to that date. Since then a 3 neutrino model has been used. Precision combined measurements were reported in 2008 and 2011: :\\\\Delta m_{21}^2 = 7.59 \\\\pm 0.21 \\\\cdot 10^{-5} \\\\, \\\\text{eV}^2,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\tan^2 \\\\theta _{12} = 0.47^{+0.06}_{-0.05} =Geological antineutrinos (geoneutrinos)= KamLAND also published an investigation of geologically-produced antineutrinos (so-called geoneutrinos) in 2005. These neutrinos are produced in the decay of thorium and uranium in the Earth's crust and mantle. A few geoneutrinos were detected and these limited data were used to limit the U/Th radiopower to under 60TW. Combination results with Borexino were published in 2011, measuring the U/Th heat flux. New results in 2013, benefiting from the reduced backgrounds due to Japanese reactor shutdowns, were able to constrain U/Th radiogenic heat production to 11.2^{+7.9}_{-5.1} TW using 116 \\\\bar{ u}_e events. This constrains composition models of the bulk silicate Earth and agrees with the reference Earth model. = KamLAND-Zen Double Beta Decay Search = KamLAND-Zen uses the detector to study beta decay of 136Xe from a balloon placed in the scintillator in summer 2011. Observations set a limit for neutrinoless double- beta decay half-life of . A double beta decay lifetime was also measured: 2.38 \\\\pm{0.02(\\\\mathrm{stat})} \\\\pm{0.14(\\\\mathrm{syst})} *10^{21} yr, consistent with other xenon studies. KamLAND-Zen plans continued observations with more enriched Xe and improved detector components. An improved search was published in August 2016, increasing the half-life limit to , with a neutrino mass bound of 61‚Äì165 meV. The first KamLAND-Zen apparatus, KamLAND-Zen 400, has as of 2018 completed two research programs, Phase I (2011 Oct. - 2012 Jun.) and Phase II (2013 Dec. - 2015 Oct.). The combined data of Phase I and II implied the lower bound 1.07 \\\\times 10^{26} years for the neutrinoless double beta decay half-life. The second KamLAND-Zen experiment apparatus, KamLAND-Zen 800, with bigger balloon of about 750kg of Xenon was installed in the KamLAND detector 10 May 2018. The operation is expected to start winter 2018-2019 with 5 years of expected operation.http://www.ba.infn.it/~now/now2018/assets/yoshihitogandonow2018.pdf The KamLAND-Zen collaboration is planning to construct another apparatus, KamLAND2-Zen in the long term.

In 1980 he wrote Il Manuale del Playboy (Manual for Playboys), a textbook about where European playboys live, what cars they drive, and other lifestyle tips.  Biography  = The Beginning = Barbieri was born in Milan, Italy. In the early 1960s he started collaborating with comics publishers like Editoriale Dardo and Edizioni Alpe. He was also a journalist for the tabloid La Notte. In the mid-1960s, after reading a rather violent White Cartoon French book, he decided to open a publishing house in Milan and developed the idea of \\"pocket comics\\", also known as a digest. This was a time when the adult black comics genre (Diabolik, Kriminal and Satanik), a series of paperback featuring graphic violence and scantily-clad women, was at its peak. In 1966 he created Editore 66, inspired by film and literary subjects of the time (such as Angelica and James Bond) and developed the plots of his first two comics books, Isabella and Grendizer (both illustrated by Sandro Angiolini). Initially slightly erotic in terms of contents, the books became progressively more pornographic towards the end of the 1970s, reflecting the sexual revolution and the increasing permissiveness in the press and in film taking place in Italy at the time. Images like a bare breast which in the mid-1960s would have been scandalous suddenly looked almost chaste and innocent. = Erregi = In 1967 Barbieri partnered with Giorgio Cavedon, and together they founded the publishing house ErreGi. They went on to create other sexy-heroines like Jacula, Lucrezia, Messalina, Hessa, De Sade, Lucifera, Jolanda, Vartan, Walalla, Yra, Jungle and Bonnie. In 1972, as a result of creative differences and the need to reinvest the capital to cope with the rising competition in erotic comics, Barbieri and Cavedon separated and formed their own companies. Cavedon retained all the popular existing titles and renamed ErreGi Ediperiodici. Barbieri founded Edifumetto. = Edifumetto = Under the new banner of Edifumetto, Barbieri created some of the most notable titles of the horror and soft porn comics genre, including Zora la Vampira, Rolando del Fico, Cimiteria, Vampiro, Scheletro, Sukia Belzeba, Playcolt, Mafia, Poppea, Necron, and dozens of other characters. Their success was due in large part to the covers painted by classically trained artists such as Alessandro Biffignandi, Emanuele Taglietti, Roberto Molino, Pino Dangelico, Enzo Sciotti, and Carlo Jacono. Within a few years Edifumetto was publishing a new edition almost every day (and doubled in the summer with special supplements). To diversify the brand, Barbieri created other publishing ventures, including Edizioni GEIS, SEGI, Il Vascello, Centroedizioni, Squalo Comics, Renzo Barbieri Editore, and produced time- sensitive comics like Il Paninaro, Skate Map and Il Leghista. Barbieri's last company, Edifumetto 3000, folded in the early 2000s.

Overview Born on 2 March 1855 in Holbeck near Leeds in Yorkshire, Peate's career, which lasted from 1879 to 1890, was exceptional but short. He earned his place in the Yorkshire side in 1879 and, \\"before the season was over,\\" wrote WG Grace (against whom he enjoyed conspicuous success), \\"had taken rank with the very best bowlers in England. Every year added to his fine reputation; and no matter the company he played in he came through the ordeal most successfully.\\"Grace, W.G.: Cricket (J.W. Arrowsmith, 1891), p. 353. Peate rose in 1880 to the top of the cricketing tree and remained there until the end of 1884. He amply filled the boots of Alfred Shaw, becoming the first- choice slow-bowler for the England elevens of his era. Despite a serious ankle sprain, which kept him out of action for a fortnight, Peate managed a new record wicket haul for a county-cricket season with 214 in 1882. As Grace affirms, \\"Peate... had now become the acknowledged best slow bowler of England\\".Grace, op. cit., p. 168. His finest (and lowest) hour came in the Test Match against Australia at the Oval of August 1882, when he was the last man in to bat at the end of England's second innings, with his country needing only ten runs to win. Peate got only two before he was bowled by Harry Boyle, giving the Australians their first ever Test win in England. He arrived back in the dressing-room to be admonished for not having left the job to his better-equipped partner, the in-form Charles Studd. \\"I couldn't trust Mr Studd,\\" Peate explained. Although less famous than the death notice of English cricket which appeared in The Sporting Times on 2 September 1882, another in similar vein was published on 30 August 1882 in C. W. Alcock's Cricket: a Weekly Record of The Game, reading:Alcock, C. W., (ed.), Cricket: a Weekly Record of The Game dated 31 August 1882 There ought to have been many more years of good work ahead of him, but he put on a great deal of weight and showed a weakness for alcohol. In the summer of 1886, it became evident that his days in first-class cricket were numbered. It was said that he would \\"have lasted longer had he ordered his life more carefully.\\" He never entirely lost his skill as a bowler. Even up to the last year or two of his life, he played with success in club cricket in and around Leeds. He died on 11 March 1900 in Newlay, Horsforth, Yorkshire. Best performances Some of his best performances with the ball were: 6 wickets for 14 runs, Yorkshire against Middlesex, at Huddersfield, 1879. :5 wickets 11 for runs, Yorkshire v. Derbyshire, at Derby, 1880. :14 wickets 130 for runs, Yorkshire v. Sussex, at Brighton, 1881. :14 wickets 77 for runs, Yorkshire v. Surrey, at Huddersfield. :8 wickets 71 for runs, England v.

Biography  Dwight Smith was born in Dayton, Ohio in 1886, the third child of Andrew Jackson Smith and Nancy Evaline Moore, and was named after the evangelist Dwight Moody. His father, a Civil War Hundred Days Man, had been a farmer (in Logan County, Ohio and Kansas), a teamster and salesman for a flour milling company (in Dayton), and minor political figure (elected to the Dayton Board of Education). Dwight Smith graduated from Steele High School in Dayton and graduated in 1907 from The Ohio State University with a degree in Civil Engineering in Architecture. He studied architecture at Columbia University. In 1909, he worked for one year as an architectural draftsman in the Office of the Supervising Architect in Washington, DC before returning to Columbia to receive his Bachelor of Architecture degree in 1910. At Columbia, he won the $1,100 Perkins Traveling Fellowship and traveled and studied in Europe for 10 months in 1911, mainly in Italy. He had associated with the firm of John Russell Pope after graduation, and returned from Europe to rejoin Pope's firm in November 1911 where he became the chief designer, working on the Vanderbilt mansion on Long Island and the New York Fifth Avenue mansion of Henry Clay Frick of Carnegie Steel Company. He continued his association with Pope until he was persuaded to come to Columbus, Ohio to design the new football stadium about 1917. While he was designing and overseeing the construction of Ohio Stadium, he was also a Professor of Architecture at Ohio State for three years from 1918 to 1921. Ohio Stadium was then the largest two level, open ended stadium in the world. He then took a position as chief architect for the Columbus Public Schools. Later he returned to Ohio State where he served as University Architect from October 1929 to June 1956. Smith designed the first permanent school in Upper Arlington, Ohio. The building opened in 1924 serving grades 1-6; grades 7-12 were added to the building following its 1926 expansion; the building was renamed Upper Arlington High School in 1939 with the opening of another Smith designed school, Barrington Road Elementary School. (now Jones Middle School) in Upper Arlington, completed 1924 As his mentor Pope had done at Yale University, Smith revised a long term campus master plan for The Ohio State University. He proposed to extend the campus beyond the Olentangy River. Over his career as University Architect at Ohio State, especially in the post-World War II years, he designed or oversaw design and planning of some thirty University buildings, including the expansion of the landmark William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library, which dominates the main University landscape on the Oval. Among these were Hughes Hall (music), the Alpheus W. Smith Laboratory (physics), the Agricultural Laboratories, the optometry building, and especially the St. John Arena and French Field House. The task of designing and overseeing the construction of so many new buildings in those years became such that some outside architects were engaged for the purpose as, for example, with the Ohio Union, Mershon Auditorium, and most of those in the Medical Center complex. Smith Hall is named in his honor. Smith was in continual demand as a consultant for various agencies or on specific projects including Wittenberg College, the Upper Arlington Board of Education, the Columbus and Springfield Y.M.C.A.‚Äôs, the Deshler Hotel (Columbus), the million-dollar First Congregational Church, Columbus (where he represented the John Russell Pope office), the Springfield Masonic Temple, the Marietta and Columbus City Halls and Columbus West High School. Dwight Smith married Myrna Cott of Columbus, Ohio, January 29, 1912. They had five children. After the death of his first wife, he married Mary Edith Thompson Gramlich, a widow with two daughters, January 17, 1936. He resided in New York City from 1908 to 1917 and in Upper Arlington, Ohio until his death. An enthusiastic Buckeyes football fan, for years he had seats in Ohio Stadium in the row behind fellow Daytonian Orville Wright, another enthusiastic fan. Smith's grandchildren include the motion picture actress Beverly D'Angelo and the jazz musician Jeff D'Angelo. He is the father-in-law of Gene D'Angelo, former president of WBNS stations in Columbus, Ohio. His work was also part of the architecture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

The course is provided by the Joint Services Command and Staff College of the British Armed Forces initially for 24 colonels or equivalent aged 41 to 44 years (and a few lieutenant-colonels and brigadiers): 15 from the army, 1 or 2 from the Royal Navy, 1 or 2 from the Royal Air Force, and 4 from overseas (such as the United States of America, Germany, Netherlands, and Australia), and some civilians (from the Ministry of Defence). In 1994 it was increased to 30 officers, and was part of the new Joint Service Command and Staff College, having originally been at the Staff College, Camberley. The course lasts 17 weeks and concentrates on joint operations. Led by the Colonel Higher Command and Staff Course, from 1988, the course is based on the German F√ºhrungsakademie, Hamburg, and the US Command and General Staff College School of Advanced Military Studies. There are 9 phases including out of area and future battlefield. The course culminates in an army-group level ADP backed wargaming exercise. Those attending the annual course, and those on the Directing Staff receive the letters \\"HCSC\\" in the service List.

During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, he served in in Cuban waters and later was executive officer of when that ship circumnavigated the globe with the Great White Fleet. As the capability of aircraft to bombard warships was grower ever more likely, in 1911 Twining developed the U.S. Navy's first anti-aircraft cannon. The prototype was a 1-pounder. It was not placed in production, but provided the conceptual basis for the upscale 3 inch anti-aircraft cannon mounted on most U.S. warships during World War I.\\"New American Aerial Weapons\\" Popular Mechanics, December 1911, p. 776. In 1911 he succeeded his father as an hereditary member of the Delaware Society of the Cincinnati. He commanded during the bombardment of Veracruz, Mexico in 1914.

Blending elements of fantasy, history, spirituality and science fiction, the film consists of three storylines involving immortality and the resulting loves lost, and one man's pursuit of avoiding this fate in this life or beyond it. Jackman and Weisz play sets of characters bonded by love across time and space: a conquistador and his ill-fated queen, a modern-day scientist and his cancer-stricken wife, and a traveler immersed in a universal journey alongside aspects of his lost love. The storylines‚Äîinterwoven with use of match cuts and recurring visual motifs‚Äîreflect the themes and interplay of love and mortality. Aronofsky originally planned to direct The Fountain on a $70 million budget with Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in the lead roles, but Pitt's withdrawal and cost overruns led Warner Bros. to shut down his production. The director rewrote the script to be sparser, and was able to resurrect the film with a $35 million budget with Jackman and Weisz in the lead roles. Production mainly took place on a sound stage in Montreal, Quebec, and the director used macro photography to create key visual effects for The Fountain at a low cost. The film was released theatrically in the United States and Canada on November 22, 2006. It grossed $10,144,010 in the United States and Canada and $5,761,344 in other territories for a worldwide total of $15,978,422. Critics' reactions to the film were divided, but it has gained a cult following since its release. Plot One of the film's narratives takes place during the Spanish Inquisition.Conquistador Tom√°s Verde in New Spain fights a band of Mayans to gain entry into a pyramid, where he is attacked by a Mayan priest. The story intercuts to a similar looking man, tending a tall tree in a glass dome biosphere travelling through space, annoyed by a woman called Izzi. Finally, a third iteration, present-day doctor Tom Creo, is losing his wife Izzi to a brain tumor. Tom is working on a cure using samples from a tree found through exploration in Guatemala, which are being tested for medicinal use for degenerative brain diseases in his lab. Izzi has come to terms with her mortality, but Tom refuses to accept it, focused on his quest to find a cure for her. She writes a story called \\"The Fountain\\" about Queen Isabella losing her kingdom to the Inquisition and a commission given by her to Tom√°s Verde to search for the Tree of Life in the Central American forest in Mayan territory. As she does not expect to finish her book, Izzi asks Tom to finish it for her. As they look up at the golden nebula of Xibalba, she imagines, as the Mayans did, that their souls will meet there after death and when the star goes supernova. She dies shortly thereafter and Tom dedicates himself to curing not only her disease but death itself after seeing experimental success in reversing aging. His colleagues fear that this drive has made him reckless, but they support him in his scientific work and emotionally at Izzi's funeral. Tom plants a sweetgum seed at Izzi's grave in the manner of a story she told him relating how a Mayan guide's dead father lived on in a tree nourished by the organic nutrients of the buried body. In the Mayan jungle, Tom√°s finds that most of his fellow knights are exhausted and refuse to continue searching for the Tree of Life. After a failed coup and the death of their priest guide, he takes the few who remain loyal with him to a pyramid, carrying a ceremonial dagger. Once he arrives at the pyramid, the first scene repeats and Tom√°s engages in combat with the Mayan priest. The space traveller (whether this character is a version of Tom, an element of Izzy's story, or Tom himself in the future is unclear) spends much of his time performing physical or mental exercises, including a form of meditation allowing him to perceive and interact with the past. In that past, Tom√°s is stabbed in the stomach but, just as the priest is about to kill him, he appears before the figurehead. The priest now believes Tom√°s is the \\"First Father\\" who birthed all life. Tom√°s kills the priest as a sacrifice and proceeds to a pool with a large tree, convinced this is the Tree of Life. Tom√°s applies some of its sap to his torso and is cured of his stab wound. He drinks the sap flowing from the bark. But in a reenactment of the Mayan creation myth recounted earlier, his body is turned into flowers and grass that burst forth from it and he literally gives rise to new life, killing himself in the process. In space, the tree finally dies just before the spaceship arrives at its destination, much to the horror of the version of Tom tending it. A final vision of Izzi appears, comforting him in the face of his acceptance of death. The star goes supernova, engulfing the ship and everything within. The traveler's body, engulfed by the dying star inside of the nebula, is absorbed by the tree, causing it to flourish back to life. Izzi's apparition picks a fruit from the new tree of life and hands it to Tom, who plants it in Izzi's grave. Cast * Hugh Jackman as Tom√°s Verde / Thomas Creo / Tommy the Space Traveler: A 16th century Spanish conquistador set out in the deep jungles of South America to find the elixir of life that was purported to come from the Fountain of Youth springing forth from a tree atop a Mayan pyramid, where he fiercely fought a Mayan high priest. In the present, a scientist discovers a South American tree with promising life-extending properties in an attempt to cure his wife of brain cancer. Centuries later, a man journeys through deep space in a futuristic spherical spacecraft with a tree assumed to be the one Tom Creo planted on the grave of his wife Izzi half a millennium earlier, heading toward a dying star believing its explosion will restore her. Jackman played all three characters in three interweaving narratives spanning a period of one thousand years, beginning in 1500 A.D. * Rachel Weisz as Isabella I of Castile / Izzi Creo A terminally-ill woman writes an unfinished manuscript titled \\"The Fountain\\" about a 16th century Spanish queen held captive by a powerful Catholic priest, who sends her most loyal henchman to find a legendary tree she believes would free her and her subjects from the Inquisition. Weisz, speaking to The Guardian, shared how working with director Aronofsky, who was then in a relationship with her at the time of filming and release, was \\"very different to who we are around the house.\\" * Ellen Burstyn as Dr. Lillian Guzetti * Stephen McHattie as Grand Inquisitor Silecio His growing power and ruthless crackdown on the queen's loyal subjects, branded as heretics during the Inquisition, threatens the peace of her kingdom. * Mark Margolis as Father Avila * Cliff Curtis as Captain Ariel Narrative structure The three stories are interwoven with match cuts and recurring visual motifs; Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz play the main characters in all three narratives. Whether the actions in these stories are actual events, or symbolic, is not clear: director Darren Aronofsky emphasized that the storylines in their time periods and their respective convergences were open to interpretation. The director has said of The Fountains intricacy and underlying message, \\"[The film is] very much like a Rubik's Cube, where you can solve it in several different ways, but ultimately there's only one solution at the end.\\" Themes In a 2012 interview outlining the path of life depicted, Aronofsky stated that \\"ultimately the film is about coming to terms with your own death\\" oftentimes driven by love. The film asks such questions as \\"What if you could live forever?\\" and depicts one man's journey to overcome death. Related to this path, Darren Aronofsky described the core of the film as \\"a very simple love story\\" about a man and a woman in love, with the woman's life cut short. The director researched people who were dying young, and learned from doctors and caregivers that such patients find new ways of coping. Aronofsky observed that the patients often die more alone because their families cannot recognize what happens with them, calling it \\"an incredible tragedy\\": > Instead of facing this tragedy in terror, she is coming to terms with what > is happening to her... Many patients actually start opening up to the > possibility of what's happening to them, but there's very little vocabulary > to help them deal... We decided to expand it with this woman [Izzi] offering > a gift to her husband as a metaphor that tells him where she's come to in > her awe inspiring journey towards death. Hopefully through time he'll be > able to understand it and basically get where she is. The Fountains theme of fear of death is \\"a movement from darkness into light, from black to white\\" that traces the journey of a man scared of death and moving toward it. The film begins with a paraphrase of Genesis 3:24, the Biblical passage that reflects The Fall of Man. Hugh Jackman emphasized the importance of the Fall in the film: \\"The moment Adam and Eve ate of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, humans started to experience life as we all experience it now, which is life and death, poor and wealthy, pain and pleasure, good and evil. We live in a world of duality. Husband, wife, we relate everything. And much of our lives are spent not wanting to die, be poor, experience pain. It's what the movie's about.\\" Aronofsky also interpreted the story of Genesis as the definition of mortality for humanity. He inquired of the Fall, \\"If they had drank from the Tree of Life [along with the Tree of Knowledge] what would have separated them from their maker? So what makes us human is actually death. It's what makes us special.\\" Aronofsky's sensibility can be placed between Kubrick's exploration of humanity, and Spielberg's emotionality as he \\"combines elements of Kubrick‚Äôs excess visible in the human condition and leading us toward the limit of existence in obsession or madness, and of Spielberg‚Äôs emotion and the wish to leave a ray of hope, regardless of how hopeless the situation might be.\\"Skorin-Kapov, Jadranka (2015) Darren Aronofsky's Films and the Fragility of Hope, p. 66, Bloomsbury Academic Production =Development= Production on The Fountain went through several stages of casting. Rachel Weisz joined the cast in August 2004 after Cate Blanchett moved on to other projects. Director Darren Aronofsky sought to produce The Fountain after the release of Requiem for a Dream in 2000. In April 2001, he entered negotiations with Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow to direct the then-untitled film with actor Brad Pitt in the lead role. Requiem for a Dream was screened for Pitt, and the preliminary script for The Fountain persuaded the actor to join the project. Aronofsky prepared for production by traveling with a crew to Central America to consult with Mayan experts and to explore the Mexican ruins of Palenque. The group also visited Tikal, a jungle location featured in the 1977 film Star Wars. In addition to the trip, the films Aguirre, the Wrath of God and The Holy Mountain were screened for the crew to inspire it in designing a rainforest set for The Fountain. In June 2001, actress Cate Blanchett entered talks to join Aronofsky's project. Aronofsky, who wanted the film's actual title to be a secret, gave the project the working title of The Last Man. Production was postponed to improve the script and to wait for Blanchett, pregnant when she joined, to give birth to her child in December 2001. The start date for production was tentatively set in summer 2002. In June 2002, Warner Bros. met with Aronofsky and producer Eric Watson, expressing concerns over an escalating budget and threatening to cease the project unless a co- financier was found. Watson petitioned independent production companies for support and was able to enlist Regency Enterprises for assistance. Production was ultimately set for late October 2002 in Queensland and Sydney, Australia. The film, officially titled The Fountain, was 'greenlit' (approved for production) with a budget of $70 million, co-financed by Warner Bros. and New Regency, who filled the gap after Village Roadshow withdrew from the project. Preparation for production of The Fountain cost $18 million. Abruptly, Pitt, whose requested screenplay revisions were not met, left the project seven weeks before the first day of shooting. The actor went on to star as Achilles in director Wolfgang Petersen's Troy. With the studio threatening to shut down the project, Aronofsky sent the script to actor Russell Crowe as a potential replacement for Pitt. However, Crowe, worn out from recently completing Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, declined. In September 2002, Jeff Robinov, President of Production at Warner Bros. Pictures, announced that The Fountain would cease production, with Blanchett receiving compensation for her time and the Australian crew being fired from the halted project. Sets built for the production of the film, including a 10-story Mayan temple, were eventually auctioned off, in addition to props and other items. Pitt said that he was disappointed to leave and added, \\"I remain encouraged that The Fountain will yet have its day.\\" Aronofsky began to develop other films. When he looked over the books he used to research for The Fountain, he decided to return to The Fountain, feeling closer to it creatively than the other possible projects. Without a studio and an actor, he decided to write a \\"no-budget\\" version of the film, using his experiences filming Pi and Requiem for a Dream with small budgets. In February 2004, Warner Bros. resurrected Aronofsky's project and began to court actor Hugh Jackman to replace Pitt in the lead role. The film received a second greenlight with a budget of $35 million, in part because of the director's willingness to leave costly set pieces out of the screenplay. In August, actress Rachel Weisz joined Hugh Jackman for the film, filling the vacancy left by Blanchett. Filming lasted 60 days in early 2005 and took place mainly on a sound stage in Montreal. =Writing= Darren Aronofsky and his friend Ari Handel created the story for The Fountain, and Aronofsky wrote the screenplay. When Aronofsky saw The Matrix in 1999, he considered it a film that redefined the science fiction genre. He sought to make a science fiction film that would explore new territory in the genre like The Matrix and its predecessors Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Aronofsky had in mind a science fiction film that would go beyond the other films whose plots were driven by technology and science. The director said, \\"We've seen it all. It's not really interesting to audiences anymore. The interesting things are the ideas; the search for God, the search for meaning.\\" In 1999, when Aronofsky turned 30 years old, his parents were diagnosed with cancer. He began reflecting on human mortality, \\"That was a really heavy-duty emotional time. I know it's a very young age, but turning thirty marks when your twenties are over and you could start considering, 'Wow, one of these days I'm actually going to die.'\\" While his parents overcame cancer, he began to focus on the concept of a young man saving a loved one from a life-threatening disease. He shared the concept with Handel, his undergraduate school roommate at Harvard University. Handel earned a Ph.D in neuroscience from New York University but was uncertain about a future in neuroscience. He recalled the discussion, \\"Darren and I just started talking about the story. We kept wanting to talk more about it as the story kept getting bigger. I decided to make some life choices to continue working with Darren, because it was so much fun.\\" The director relied on a change of locale to inspire him to write Pi and Requiem for a Dream. For The Fountain, Aronofsky was inspired by a research trip he took to Guatemala with Handel to learn about Mayan history and philosophy. The script for The Fountain was influenced by the accounts of Uruguayan journalist Eduardo Galeano, who wrote examples of myth from an indigenous perspective, particularly Galeano's Genesis trilogy. The film Once Upon a Time in America also served as an influence on the script. Aronofsky, influenced by Bernal D√≠az del Castillo's The Conquest of New Spain, applied the narrative in writing the film's conquistador scenes. Aronofsky realized that since writing in 2000 the battle scene between the armies of Mayans and conquistadors, The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, Troy, King Arthur, and other films had featured massive battle scenes. He felt less inclined to mimic the scale and rewrote the battle to be mainly between Jackman's conquistador character and the Mayans. The director realized that, with one man against the army, the rewrite was a suitable metaphor for his film's theme of a man defying odds to do the impossible and conquer death. The filmmakers researched space travel and Mayan culture, including its history, religion, and spirituality. They attended brain surgeries with the actors. With the research in place, Aronofsky said, \\"We decided which things we wanted to be purely factual and which things we wanted to bend.\\" The director did not strive to be historically accurate with the various time periods, perceiving the entire film as a setting of a fairy tale. He said, \\"It was more about painting a relationship between a queen and her warrior, and just using that for more fantasy reasons.\\" =Casting= Hugh Jackman who plays multiple characters in The Fountain‚Äîwas chosen to star in the film after Brad Pitt dropped out and the project was halted. Aronofsky saw Hugh Jackman perform as Peter Allen in the Broadway musical The Boy from Oz and was impressed with his performance. The director met with Jackman, who sought \\"a role that could show a lot of dimension,\\" and cast him into the lead role in The Fountain. Jackman starred previously as the muscular character Wolverine in the X-Men films, so for The Fountain, he exercised to adopt a slimmer figure. Jackman practiced t'ai chi for seven months to demonstrate it in a 30-second scene. He also practiced yoga for over a year to achieve the lotus position for scenes set in space. For these scenes when he is seen in the position in mid-air, he was immersed in a swimming pool and harnessed to a rig that rotated him 360 degrees so his clothes floated freely about him. Jackman also watched a woman undergo brain tumor surgery and was shaken to see the woman have similar blond hair to his wife: \\"All I could think of was my wife on that table. As much as I'd read the script and theorized and practiced philosophy, I knew in that moment that I was so not ready for death.\\" For his various characters, the actor assumed a different posture for each persona. As the conquistador, Jackman was upright and forward-leaning to evoke an unstoppable nature. As the scientist, the actor hunched over with a dedicated focus on his character's work, being weighed down by the \\"world on his shoulders.\\" As the space traveler, Jackman practiced the state of zen but also exhibited a continued persistence in his endeavor. Jackman suggested that Aronofsky cast Rachel Weisz as his character's wife. The director, who was in a relationship with the actress, had originally hesitated to show the studio signs of favoritism in casting Weisz. With Jackman's earnest recommendation, the actress was cast as Izzi/Isabel. For her role, Weisz read books and first-person accounts about people who had terminal illnesses. The actress also visited hospitals to see young people who were dying and under hospice care. \\"There were a few days where I was in the headspace where I could say: 'I could go now',\\" said Weisz. The Fountain also stars Ellen Burstyn as Dr. Lillian Guzetti, Tom's superior, and Mark Margolis as Father Avila, who accompanies Tom√°s the conquistador. Burstyn and Margolis appeared in Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream, and the director wrote into the script roles for both of them. Sean Patrick Thomas, Donna Murphy, and Ethan Suplee were cast as assistants to Tom's lab work. Cliff Curtis was cast as Captain Ariel, a fellow conquistador, and Stephen McHattie was cast as Grand Inquisitor Silecio, a religious fanatic who threatens the Spanish queen. Seventy extras were cast as Maya warriors, including twenty who had actual Guatemala Mayan backgrounds. One of the twenty, a real-life spiritual leader, was cast as the Maya spiritual leader in the film. =Design= The film's locations, with the exception of scenes filmed at a museum and at a farmhouse, were built on the Montreal sound stage. Production designer James Chinlund and his crew built sets for The Fountain in a large warehouse in Montreal. The sets included the 16th century jungle settings and the bubble-shaped spacecraft containing the tree of life and its garden. The spacecraft set was placed against greenscreen, and the crew hung colored reflective material, which included green, black, gold, and silver, on three circular tracks around the set. One material would be moved into place instead of the heavy equipment, and with the other materials partitioned off, a light source was used with the preferred material. Silver was used for scenes in which the spacecraft moved through the stars, and gold was used for when it entered the nebula. In The Fountain, the Tree of Life was a central design and part of the film's three periods. The tree was based on Kabbalah's Sefirot, which depicts a \\"map\\" of creation to understand the nature of God and how he created the world ex nihilo (out of nothing). The Sefirot Tree, being two to three hundred feet tall in lore, had to be resized for The Fountain to fit in the camera's frame. Pieces of driftwood and pieces from real trees in Canada were collected for the tree's branches and roots, and sculpted molds of the pieces were applied to a steel frame to create the tree's body. According to production designer James Chinlund, the tree, part of an enormous set surrounded by green screens, and other sets presented difficult logistical problems because of the small budget given to the resurrected project. The tree set itself had been a collaboration between Chinlund, Aronofsky, and cinematographer Matthew Libatique to create the appropriate design, particularly the palette in comparison to the biospheric ship that carries the tree in the astronaut period. Aronofsky described the astronaut period as a homage to David Bowie's \\"Space Oddity\\"; the protagonist's name \\"Tom\\" originating from the Major Tom of the popular song. Co-writer Ari Handel researched biospherics, such as the Biosphere 2, to help design the ship that carried the protagonist and the tree through space. With respect to the glass- sphered ship's design, Aronofsky argued, \\"There is no reason a spaceship would be built like a giant truck in space.\\" Aronofsky and cinematographer Matthew Libatique also discussed using a limited palette of colors, an approach that started with Aronofsky's Pi and continued with Requiem for a Dream. In The Fountain, the primary colors are gold and white. Gold represents \\"the Mayans, a sort of fool's gold, a false truth\\"; Aronofsky explained the choice, \\"When you see gold, it represents materialism and wealth and all these things that distract us from the true journey that we're on.\\" White was chosen to represent mortality and truth. Weisz's characters are white, and wear white or are enveloped in white light to accentuate this presentation. Secondary colors are green, representing the color of life, and red, representing death. The director also used similar geometric constructs in the film to distinguish the three storylines. The 16th century conquistador's tale reflected triangles through pyramids and constellations, the 21st century researcher's period reflected rectangles through doors, windows, and computer screens, and the 26th century contemplative's journey reflected circles and spheres through the spacecraft and stellar bodies. =Cinematography= Rather than resort to CGI for special effects, Aronofsky preferred trick photography, such as enhancing photographs of microorganisms Cinematographer Matthew Libatique shot The Fountain under Aronofsky's direction. Libatique, who worked with Aronofsky throughout the 1990s, prepared for over a year for The Fountain when Aronofsky tried to produce the film for the first time. When production restarted on a smaller budget, Libatique felt that the more budget-conscious approach resulted in a better film, \\"I think the streamlining of the film helped us tell the story more effectively. It's been stripped down to its core, to what it's really about: a search for immortality, when the truth of life is mortality.\\" Aronofsky planned to have a strong presentation of the thematic movement from darkness into light. He originally sought to show only a silhouette of the man until the second of the film's three acts, but he chose not to be so extreme, wanting to be more communicative to the audience. The movement was presented less aggressively in the film; Jackman's characters are seen in silhouette at the beginning, kept out of key light. In each of the three periods, the lighting on Jackman's characters is initially dim and gradually grows brighter as the storylines unfold. Meanwhile, Weisz's characters are frequently awash with light in the storylines. Libatique described the metaphoric change of the lighting on Jackman's characters, \\"We follow the arc of the Thomas character as he gets closer and closer to the truth.\\" Aronofsky preferred to use one camera whenever possible, only using a second camera if the scene was more about the setting and could be shot from two distinctly different axes. Libatique said Aronofsky preferred the eyeline match, \\"Darren is big on eyelines, and if you sacrifice an eyeline on an angle, he feels it nullifies the shot and de-emphasizes the performances.\\" Aronofsky originally intended to have Jackman's characters always moving in an \\"unusual\\" left-to-right direction across the frame, but the plan was complicated by the spacecraft needing to move upward toward a light source. =Visual effects= When production restarted in 2005, there was a more budget-conscious approach to filming The Fountain, whose original budget was mostly intended for visual effects. Libatique reflected, \\"Visual effects a lot of the budget in the original conception. The popcorn moments were in there to justify the budget and bring target audiences into the theater. Ultimately, I think the streamlining of the film helped us tell the story more effectively. It's been stripped down to the core, to what it's really about: a search for immortality, when the truth of life is mortality. I think at the end of the day, the theme of the film will be easier to feel.\\" To create a death scene, Aronofsky drew from Mayan mythology the description of flowers and butterflies emerging from the bodies of valiant warriors when they die. Aronofsky excluded butterflies from the death scene to minimize the film's computer-generated imagery but kept the effect of flowers bursting from the body. Jeremy Dawson and Dan Schrecker, who had provided visual effects for Darren Aronofsky's œÄ and Requiem for a Dream, returned to The Fountain to help the director with the film's effects. The pair was assigned the task of creating as little computer-generated imagery as possible, a difficult task with a third of the film taking place in deep space. Aronofsky chose to avoid effects that would make the film look dated in several decades but instead hold up as well as a film like 2001: A Space Odyssey. Dawson said, \\"Using CG is really the easy route because it's so prevalent and the tools are great. What it did was really force us to come up with creative solutions to solve a lot of our problems.\\" One creative solution was uncovering Peter Parks, a specialist in macro photography, who had retrieved deep-sea microorganisms and photographed them in 3-D under partial funding from the Bahamas government. Parks brewed chemicals and bacteria together to create reactions that Schrecker and Dawson shot, recording 20,000 feet worth of film over eight weeks. To create the effects, Peter Parks took advantage of fluid dynamics, which affected the behavior of the substances that he photographed. \\"When these images are projected on a big screen, you feel like you're looking at infinity. That's because the same forces at work in the water‚Äîgravitational effects, settlement, refractive indices‚Äîare happening in outer space,\\" Parks said. The specialist's talent convinced the film's creative department to go beyond computer-generated imagery and follow Parks' lead. Instead of millions of dollars for a single special effects sequence, Parks generated all the footage for the film for just $140,000. The visual-effects company Look Effects worked on 87 shots for The Fountain that included major set extensions, digital mattes, image enhancement, face replacement and blemish removal, as well as animating key elements to the film's story. Henrik Fett, the visual effects supervisor of Look Effects, said, \\"Darren was quite clear on what he wanted and his intent to greatly minimize the use of computer graphics... [and] I think the results are outstanding.\\" =Music= Clint Mansell‚Äîthe composer for Aronofsky's previous films Pi and Requiem for a Dream‚Äîreprised his role for The Fountain. The San Francisco-based string quartet Kronos Quartet‚Äîwho previously performed for the Requiem for a Dream soundtrack‚Äîand Scottish post- rock band Mogwai also contributed to the film score. Mansell researched possible scores to compose one tying together the three storylines and sought to have an organic feeling to the score and explored implementing orchestral and electronic elements that would have \\"a real human element to them that breathes.\\" While reading the script, Mansell was reminded of the post-rock music of Mogwai as well as Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Sigur R√≥s and initially planned a score based around percussion before adding the string quartet and choir. The soundtrack was released by Nonesuch Records in 2006 and received numerous award nominations. Marketing When Warner Bros. shut down pre-production of The Fountain in 2002, Aronofsky reserved rights to publish a graphic novel based on the script that was not produced. He said, \\"I knew it was a hard film to make, and I said at least if Hollywood fucks me over at least I'll make a comic book out of it.\\" He shopped the story to Vertigo Comics and met comic book artist Kent Williams, whose illustrations impressed him. Aronofsky hired Williams to create the graphic novel, and Ari Handel, co- writer for the film, provided Williams with research, photographs, and images on \\"Mayans, astronomy, pulsars, and all kinds of cool stuff\\" for the graphic novel's design. Aronofsky gave Williams the freedom to interpret the story as the artist saw fit. The Fountain was originally scheduled to be released on October 13, 2006, but the film was delayed to create a \\"long-lead campaign\\" and generate anticipation via word of mouth. The release date was ultimately set for November 22, 2006. Aronofsky shared his screenplay with eleven artists: Phil Hale, Martin Wilner, Jason Shawn Alexander, Kostas Seremetis, Dave Gibbons, Barron Storey, James Jean, Jim Lee, Olivier Bramanti, Seth Fisher, and Bill Sienkiewicz. He invited them to interpret the screenplay in each one's chosen medium, and the interpretations were intended to be available on the film's website. Aronofsky also published a book about the film that contained production stills, the original script, original art, and observations by the film's creators. The content and research agency Ramp Industry launched The Fountain Remixed, an official website driven by user- generated content. Users could download freely provided audio parts from The Fountain's film score, remix the music, and upload the work onto the website to be evaluated by other users. Release The film had its world premiere at the 63rd Venice Film Festival on September 2, 2006. Several critics booed The Fountain at the festival's press screening, while the film received a 10-minute standing ovation at the public screening the following evening. The Fountain was released in 1,472 theaters in the United States and Canada on November 22, 2006, a day before the American Thanksgiving holiday. The film earned $3,768,702 in the U.S. and Canadian box office during the opening weekend of November 24\\\\. The Fountain earned $10,144,010 in the United States and Canada, and $5,761,344 in other territories. The film, which had a production budget of $35 million, grossed $15,978,422 in theaters worldwide. The box-office performance was considered a flop with the film only earning back 54% of its budget. Reception The site's average rating is 5.94/10 and the site's critical consensus states: \\"The Fountain‚Äîa movie about metaphysics, universal patterns, Biblical symbolism, and boundless love spread across one thousand years‚Äîis visually rich but suffers from its own unfocused ambitions.\\" Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade C- on scale of A to F. Newsweek reported how people received the film, \\"Its supporters admire the film's beauty and daring; its detractors find it overblown and hokey.\\" Michael Atkinson, writing for Sight & Sound, reviewed Aronofsky's endeavor, \\"It's difficult to recall another American film that, in pursuing a passionate and personal vision, goes so maddeningly, uproariously wrong.\\" Atkinson said of the narrative, \\"The erratic and pointless leapfrogging between its storylines is torporific ... all three stories are assembled piecemeal, many of which repeat over and over as flashback and flashforwards.\\" He complained of the numerous motifs, \\"It's difficult to swallow the amalgamation of Mayan, Biblical, Buddhist, Taoist and New Age iconography, all of it tossed as if into a stew.\\" In contrast, Glenn Kenny of Premiere wrote of the film, \\"The Fountain is probably the deftest stories- within-stories narrative film I've seen ... By The Fountains end, the multilayered meta-narrative... resolves (or does it?) into a kind of diegetic M√∂bius strip, to stunning effect.\\" Kenny called the film \\"as demanding as it is dazzling\\" and compared Aronofsky's direction to Stanley Kubrick's \\"in terms of conceptual audacity and meticulousness of execution.\\" He concluded, \\"It's a movie that's as deeply felt as it is imagined.\\" Anthony Lane, reviewing for The New Yorker, called The Fountain \\"a gorgeous nimbus of confusion.\\" Lane complained about the film's up-close and far-away shots, \\"What fails to concern or attract Aronofsky is the place where most of us hang out‚Äîthe in- between, the midshot of everyday existence.\\" He summarized, \\"The movie may have significant truths to impart, although I have my doubts, but it feels too inexperienced, too unworldly, to have earned the right to them.\\" Roger Ebert, who admired Aronofsky's previous films, conceded in the Chicago Sun-Times that The Fountain was \\"not a great success.\\" He identified the film's problematic aspects: \\"too many screens of blinding lights,\\" \\"too many transitions for their own sake,\\" and \\"abrupt changes of tone.\\" He believed that the scaling down of the film from Aronofsky's original ambition lost some elements and anticipated a director's cut truer to Aronofsky's vision. In 2009, Aronofsky reflected on the reception of The Fountain: In the book Positive Psychology at the Movies: Using Films to Build Virtues and Character Strengths, Ryan M. Niemiec and Danny Wedding cite the film as one which depicts the development of perspective. \\"[Jackman's character's] denial and work addiction are obstacles to the development of the strength of perspective, but he is able to confront those obstacles as he develops acceptances and wisdom, represented by themes drawn from both Buddhism (meditation, rebirth, reincarnation) and Christianity (eternal life, faith, and love).\\" In 2016, it was listed as number 484 on Empire's 500 Greatest films of all time. =Home media= The Fountain was released on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray in the United States on May 15, 2007. The included extras were the theatrical trailer and a six-part featurette gallery about the film's periods and settings. Aronofsky was disappointed with the limited extras available on home video. He reported that Warner Bros. did not want to have the director record a commentary track because it felt the commentary would not help sales. He hoped to petition for the film to be re-released in the Criterion Collection with extras that were not made available on the initial media. Aronofsky recorded a commentary track on his own and made the track available on his personal website. In December 2008, he expressed interest in reassembling The Fountain, not as a director's cut, but as an alternate story that combined theatrical footage and unused footage.  Notes  * Warner Bros. Pictures distributed The Fountain theatrically in North America and Canada, with TFM Distribution distributing in France, Kinowelt Filmverleih distributing in Germany and Austria, Ascot Elite distributing in Switzerland and 20th Century Fox distributing in all international territories (expect for France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria).

It is produced and secreted by the intestinal glands in the ileum and the pancreas, but it is also found widely in other cells. It is however a term now rarely used in scientific literature as more precise terms are preferred. History Erepsin was discovered at the beginning of the twentieth century by German physiologist Otto Cohnheim (1873-1953) who found a substance that breaks down peptones into amino acid in the intestines. He termed this hypothetical protease in his protein extract \\"erepsin\\" in 1901, derived from a Greek word meaning \\"I break down\\" (Œ≠œÅŒµŒØœÄœâ). His discovery was significant as it overturned the previous \\"hypothesis of resynthesis\\" which proposed that proteins get broken down into peptones from which proteins may then be resynthesized, and helped establish the idea that free amino acids instead of peptones are the building blocks of protein. Erepsin was originally thought to be a single enzyme or a mixture of a few enzymes involved in the terminal stages of the breakdown of peptides to free amino acids in the intestines. However, it became clear later that erepsin is in fact a complex mixture of different peptidases. It was also found not to be unique to intestinal mucosa and is present widely in many other cells and organisms. The term erepsin fell from use in scientific literature in the latter half of the twentieth century as scientists considered its use as a term for a single enzyme or a few enzymes misleading, and more precise terms such as aminopeptidase, carboxypeptidase and dipeptidase are preferred. The term is now considered obsolete. Properties Erepsin may contain dipeptidases, aminopeptidases, occasionally carboxypeptidases, and others including leucyl aminopeptidase, prolinase and prolidase. It is often grouped under exopeptidases, proteases that work only on the outermost peptide bonds of a polypeptide chain. The optimum pH for the group of enzymes is around pH 8, but some individual enzymes within this group may be distinguished by their differences in stability and optimum pH.

Pushed by for-profit education companies, Renaissance 2010 initiative was announced in June 2004 by the Chicago Public Schools and the City of Chicago. Renaissance 2010 called for 100 new schools by 2010. Under Renaissance 2010, the Chicago Public Schools closed over 80 public schools, and sought to create 100 charter schools by 2010. These schools were to be held accountable for test score performance through 5-year contracts while following one of three governance structures: charter, contract, or performance.  Renaissance 2010 Schools Types There are three different types of Renaissance schools, a charter school, a contract school, and a performance school. * Charter ‚Äì Charter Schools are independent public schools. Free from many state laws, district initiatives, and board policies, charter teachers are employees of the nonprofit governing board or an education management organization hired by the board. Charters are operated pursuant to Illinois Charter Law (ILCS 5/27A). * Contract ‚Äì Contract Schools are a newly created public school model established as a part of Renaissance 2010. Contracts are managed by independent nonprofit organizations in accordance with Performance Agreements. Contract schoolteachers will be employees of the nonprofit. Contract schools are operated pursuant to Illinois School Code. * Performance ‚Äì Performance Schools employ CPS staff and are CPS schools that have freedom from and flexibility on many district initiatives and policies. List of Renaissance 2010 Schools Despite legislation that capped Chicago charters at 30, former CPS schools chief Arne Duncan and Mayor Daley allowed many new charter schools to open under the auspices of a single charter within the Renaissance 2010 initiative. For example, private charter operator Chicago International was allowed to operate 12 charter schools under its single charter. =Contract schools= *Austin Business and Entrepreneurship Academy *Chicago High School for the Arts *Chicago Academy High School =Performance schools= *Bronzeville Scholastic Institute (at DuSable) *Infinity Math, Science, and Technology High School *Lindblom Math and Science Academy High School *Multicultural Arts High School (at Little Village) *Pershing West Middle School (at Douglas) *Rickover Naval Academy High School (at Senn) *School of Social Justice (at Little Village) *Sherman School of Excellence (First Turn-Around School) *South Shore Fine Arts Academy (in Woodlawn) *Suder Montessori Elementary School *Tarkington School of Excellence *Daniel Hale Williams Preparatory School of Medicine (at DuSable) *UPLIFT Community School (at Arai) *World Language High School (at Little Village) =Charter schools= *Aspira Charter School (at Haugan) *Bronzeville Lighthouse Charter School *The Catalyst Schools *Chicago International Charter School - Avalon/South Shore Campus *Chicago International Charter School - Ralph Ellison Campus *Chicago International Charter School -Wrightwood Campus *Chicago Virtual Charter School *Choir Academy Charter School of Chicago *DuSable Leadership Academy of Betty Shabazz International Charter School *Erie Elementary Charter School *Galapagos Elementary Charter School *Legacy Charter School *Noble Street Charter School - Pritzker College Prep Campus *Noble Street Charter School - Rauner College Prep Campus *Noble Street Charter School - Golder College Prep Campus *Noble Street Charter School - UIC College Prep Campus *Noble Street Charter School - Gary Comer College Prep Campus *Noble Street Charter School - Rowe-Clark College Prep Campus *Noble Street Charter School - Johnson College Prep Campus *Noble Street Charter School - Bulls College Prep Campus *Perspectives Charter School ‚Äì Calumet Campus *Providence Englewood Charter School - Bunche Campus *Barbara A.

[...] All Chicago-based charter schools had scores below the statewide average in third-grade reading, third-grade math, fifth-grade reading and eighth-grade math\\".http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5369/is_200503/ai_n21369402/ A 2009 study by University of Chicago researcher Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach found more mixed results, that \\"test scores in the Renaissance schools slightly lagged those of students with similar backgrounds who attended neighborhood schools ‚Äî though not to a statistically significant degree. But results were far from homogeneous, with some Renaissance schools posting decidedly stronger test scores compared to others.\\" Schanzenbach further notes that new schools generally have higher hurdles to face than established ones, and that the best practices used in the Renaissance schools were \\"on the right track.‚Äù Another study released in 2009 by SRI International, a California- based independent research institute, indicated that Renaissance 2010 schools have performed about on par with Chicago Public School-owned schools, with potential for further improvements. Demonstrating the divisive nature of the Renaissance 2010 plan, proponents have used this study to argue that the new schools are solid foundations for better education, while opponents have used this same study to claim that the new schools provide little to no gain for their cost and social disruption.

It is a Mukhya (primary) Upanishad, and is listed as number 5 in the Muktika canon of 108 Upanishads of Hinduism. It is among the most widely translated Upanishads. It is a poetic verse style Upanishad, with 64 verses, written in the form of mantras. However, these mantras are not used in rituals, rather they are used for teaching and meditation on spiritual knowledge.Max Muller (1962), The Upanishads - Part II, Dover Publications, , pages xxvi-xxvii The Mundaka Upanishad contains three Mundakams (parts), each with two sections. The first Mundakam, states Roer, defines the science of \\"Higher Knowledge\\" and \\"Lower Knowledge\\", and then asserts that acts of oblations and pious gifts are foolish, and do nothing to reduce unhappiness in current life or next, rather it is knowledge that frees. The second Mundakam describes the nature of the Brahman, the Self, the relation between the empirical world and the Brahman, and the path to know Brahman. The third Mundakam expands the ideas in the second Mundakam and then asserts that the state of knowing Brahman is one of freedom, fearlessness, complete liberation, self-sufficiency and bliss. Some scholarsNorman Geisler and William D. Watkins (2003), Worlds Apart: A Handbook on World Views, Second Edition, Wipf, , pages 75-81 suggest that passages in the Mundaka Upanishad present the pantheism theory. In some historic Indian literature and commentaries, the Mundaka Upanishad is included in the canon of several verse-structured Upanishads that are together called as Mantra Upanishad and Mantropanishad.Introduction to the Upanishads Max Muller, Volume XV, Oxford University Press, page xliii Etymology Mundaka (Sanskrit: ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§°‡§ï) literally means \\"shaved (as in shaved head), shorn, lopped trunk of a tree\\". Eduard Roer suggests that this root is unclear, and the word as title of the Upanishad possibly refers to \\"knowledge that shaves, or liberates, one of errors and ignorance\\".muNDAka Monier Williams English Sanskrit Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit LexiconEduard Roer, Mundaka Upanishad Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. XV, No. 41 and 50, Asiatic Society of Bengal, page 142 The chapters of the Mundaka Upanishad are also sequentially referred to as \\"Mundakam\\" in ancient and medieval texts, for unclear etymological reasons. Chronology The exact chronology of Mundaka Upanishad, like other Vedic texts, is unclear.Stephen Phillips (2009), Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy, Columbia University Press, , Chapter 1 All opinions rest on scanty evidence, an analysis of archaism, style and repetitions across texts, driven by assumptions about likely evolution of ideas, and on presumptions about which philosophy might have influenced which other Indian philosophies. Phillips dates Mundaka Upanishad as a relatively later age ancient Upanishad, well after Brihadaranyaka, Chandogya, Isha, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Kena and Katha. Paul Deussen considers Mundaka Upanishad to be composed in a period where poetic expression of ideas became a feature of ancient Indian literary works.S Sharma (1985), Life in the Upanishads, , pages 17-19 Patrick OlivelleP Olivelle, 'Contributions to the Semantic History of Samnyasa' (Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 101, No. 3, 1981, pp. 265-274) writes: \\"Both the Mundaka and the Mahanarayana are rather late Upanisads and are, in all probability, post-Buddhist.\\" Max Muller states that, given the similarities, either some of the teachings of the Upanishads were influenced by the doctrine of Buddhism. Most of the teachings in the Upanishads of Hinduism, including Manduka Upanishad, however, relate to the existence of Soul and Brahman, and the paths to know, realize one's Soul (Self) and Brahman, making the fundamental premise of Mundaka Upanishad distinctly different than Buddhism's denial of \\"Self or Brahman\\".KN Jayatilleke (2010), Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, , pages 246-249, from note 385 onwards; Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, , page 64; Quote: \\"Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattƒÅ, Sanskrit: anƒÅtman, the opposed doctrine of ƒÅtman is central to Brahmanical thought). Put very briefly, this is the [Buddhist] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence.\\"; Edward Roer (Translator), , pages 2-4 Katie Javanaud (2013), Is The Buddhist 'No-Self' Doctrine Compatible With Pursuing Nirvana?, Philosophy NowJohn C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 63, Quote: \\"The Buddhist schools reject any ƒÄtman concept. As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism\\". Some of the ideas and allegories in Mundaka Upanishad have chronological roots in more ancient Vedic literature such as Brihadaranyaka, Chandogya and Katha Upanishads. The allegory of \\"blind leading the blind\\" in section 1.2 of Mundaka, for example, is also found in Katha Upanishad's chapter 1.2.Floyd H Ross (2013), The Meaning of Life in Hinduism and Buddhism, Routledge, , page 41 The allegory of two birds in section 3.1 of Mundaka Upanishad, similarly, is found in hymns of Rig Veda chapter I.164.Max Muller (1962), Manduka Upanishad, in The Upanishads - Part II, Dover Publications, , page 38 with footnote 1 Structure The Mundaka Upanishad has three Mundakams (parts, or shavings), each part has two khanda (‡§ñ‡§£‡•ç‡§°, section or volume). The section 1.1 has 9 mantras structured as metered poetic verses. Section 1.2 has 13 verses, section 2.1 includes 10 verses, section 2.2 is composed of 11 verses, section 3.1 has 10, while the last section 3.2 has 11 verses. Combined, the Upanishad features 64 mantras.Eduard Roer, Mundaka Upanishad Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. XV, No. 41 and 50, Asiatic Society of Bengal, pages 142-164Max Muller (1962), Manduka Upanishad, in The Upanishads - Part II, Dover Publications, , pages 27-42 Several manuscript versions of Mundaka Upanishad have been discovered so far. These show minor differences, particularly in the form additional text being inserted and interpolated, the insertion apparent because these texts do not fit structurally into the metered verses, and also because the same text is missing in manuscripts discovered elsewhere. Content The Mundaka Upanishad opens with declaring Brahma as the first of gods, the creator of the universe, and the knowledge of Brahman (Ultimate Reality, Eternal Principle, Cosmic Soul) to be the foundation of all knowledge.Max Muller (1962), Manduka Upanishad, in The Upanishads - Part II, Dover Publications, , page 27Eduard Roer, Mundaka Upanishad Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. XV, No. 41 and 50, Asiatic Society of Bengal, pages 150-151 The text then lists a succession of teachers who shared the knowledge of Brahman with the next generation.Robert Hume, Mundaka Upanishad, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, page 366-367 Charles Johnston suggests that this announces the Vedic tradition of teacher-student responsibility to transfer knowledge across the generations, in unbroken succession.Charles Johnston, The Mukhya Upanishads: Books of Hidden Wisdom, (1920-1931), The Mukhya Upanishads, Kshetra Books, (Reprinted in 2014), Archive of Mundaka Upanishad, page 249 Johnston further states that the names recited are metaphors, such as the One who Illuminates, Keeper of Truth, Planetary Spirit, mythological messenger between Gods and Men among others, suggesting the divine nature and the responsibility of man to continue the tradition of knowledge sharing across human generations. =The higher knowledge versus lower knowledge - First Mundakam= In verse 1.1.3 of Mundaka Upanishad, a Grihastha (householder) approaches a teacher, and asks, The setting of this question is significant, states Johnston, because it asserts that knowledge transfer is not limited to old teachers to youthful students, rather even adult householders became pupil and sought knowledge from teachers in Vedic tradition. The teacher answered, states verse 1.1.4 of the Mundaka Upanishad, by classifying all knowledge into two: \\"lower knowledge\\" and \\"higher knowledge\\". Hume calls these two forms of knowledge as \\"traditions of religion\\" and \\"knowledge of the eternal\\" respectively. The lower knowledge, states the Upanishad, includes knowledge of Vedas, phonetics, grammar, etymology, meter, astronomy and the knowledge of sacrifices and rituals. The higher knowledge is the knowledge of Brahman and Self-knowledge - the one which cannot be seen, nor seized, which has no origin, no Varna,Johnston translates this as family and color, M√ºller translates it as caste with a footnote acknowledging that the medieval era Indian commentator translates it as \\"origin and qualities\\"; see Johnston's translation of Mundaka Upanishad, page 250 and M√ºller's translation of verse 1.1.6, page 28 with footnote 1 no eyes, nor ears, no hands, nor feet, one that is the eternal, all-pervading, infinitesimal, imperishable, indestructible.Max M√ºller, The Upanishads, Part 2, Mundaka Upanishad, Oxford University Press, page 27-28 Some manuscripts of Manduka Upanishad expand the list of lower knowledge to include logic, history, Puranas and Dharma.Max M√ºller, The Upanishads, Part 2, Mundaka Upanishad, Oxford University Press, page 27 footnote 2 =Sacrifices, oblations and pious works are useless, knowledge useful - First Mundakam= The first seven mantras of second khanda of first Mundakam explain how man has been called upon, promised benefits for, scared unto and misled into performing sacrifices, oblations and pious works. In verses 1.2.7 through 1.2.10, the Upanishad asserts this is foolish and frail, by those who encourage it and those who follow it, because it makes no difference to man's current life and after-life, it is like blind men leading the blind, it is a mark of conceit and vain knowledge, ignorant inertia like that of children, a futile useless practice.Max Muller (1962), Manduka Upanishad, in The Upanishads - Part II, Dover Publications, , pages 30-33Eduard Roer, Mundaka Upanishad Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. XV, No. 41 and 50, Asiatic Society of Bengal, pages 153-154 The Mundaka Upanishad, in verses 1.2.11 through 1.2.13, asserts knowledge liberates man, and those who undertake Sannyasa (renunciation) to gain such knowledge achieve that knowledge through Tapas (meditation, austerity), living a simple tranquil life on alms, without any sacrifices and rituals.Robert Hume, Mundaka Upanishad, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, page 369 In verse 12 and 13, the Upanishad suggests that \\"perishable acts cannot lead to eternal knowledge\\", instead those who seek freedom must respectfully approach a competent, peace- filled, wise Guru (teacher) to gain knowledge.Charles Johnston, The Mukhya Upanishads: Books of Hidden Wisdom, (1920-1931), The Mukhya Upanishads, Kshetra Books, (Reprinted in 2014), Archive of Mundaka Upanishad, pages 252-253 =Brahman is the inner Self of all things - Second Mundakam= Mundaka Upanishad, in the first section of the second Mundakam, defines and expounds on the doctrine of Atman-Brahman. It asserts that just like a blazing fire creates thousand sparks and leaping flames in its own form, beings are brought forth from Brahman in its form.Robert Hume, Mundaka Upanishad, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, page 370-371 The Brahman is imperishable, without body, it is both without and within, never produced, without mind, without breath, yet from it emerges the inner Self of all things.Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, Mundaka Upanishad, Oxford University Press, page 34-35 From Brahman is born breath, mind, sensory organs, space, air, light, water, earth, everything. The section expands this idea as follows, The section continues on, asserting Brahman as the cause of mountains, rivers of every kind, plants, herbs and all living beings, and it is \\"the inner Soul that dwells in all beings\\". Brahman is everything, the empirical and the abstract, the object, the subject and the action (karma). To know Brahman, is to be liberated.Eduard Roer, Mundaka Upanishad Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. XV, No. 41 and 50, Asiatic Society of Bengal, page 143 This is a form of pantheism theory, that continues into the second section of the second Mundakam of the Upanishad.Robert Hume, Mundaka Upanishad, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, page 371-372 =Om, Self and Brahman - Second Mundakam= The Mundaka Upanishad, in the second Mundakam, suggests a path to knowing the Self and the Brahman: meditation, self-reflection and introspection.Eduard Roer, Mundaka Upanishad Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. XV, No. 41 and 50, Asiatic Society of Bengal, page 144 The verses in the second and third Mundakams, also assert that the knowledge of soul (self) and Brahman \\"cannot\\" be gained from chanting the Vedas, but only comes from meditation and inner introspection for meaning. Adi Shankara, in his review of the Mundaka Upanishad, calls the meditation as Yoga.Mundaka Upanishad, in Upanishads and Sri Sankara's commentary - Volume 1: The Isa Kena and Mundaka, SS Sastri (Translator), University of Toronto Archives, page 153 with section in 138-152 In verse 2.2.2, the Mundaka Upanishad asserts that Atman-Brahman is the real. In verse 2.2.3 offers an aid to the meditation process, namely Om (Aum). The poetic verse is structured as a teacher-pupil conversation, but where the teacher calls the pupil as a friend, as follows, The second part of the Mundaka Upanishad discusses Om as a means of meditation for self-realization. The Upanishad, in verse 2.2.8 asserts that the man with the knowledge of the soul and who has become one with Brahman, is liberated, is not affected by karman, is free of sorrow and self-doubts, is one who lives in bliss.Mundaka Upanishad, in Upanishads and Sri Sankara's commentary - Volume 1: The Isa Kena and Mundaka, SS Sastri (Translator), University of Toronto Archives, pages 138-152 =Reach the highest Oneness in all beings - Third Mundakam= The third Mundakam begins with the allegory of two birds, as follows, Mathur states that this metaphor of the birds sitting on the same tree refers to one being the empirical self and the other as the eternal and transcendental self.DC Mathur (1972), The Concept of Self in the Upanishads: An Alternative Interpretation, Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, Vol. 32, No. 3, pages 390-396 It is the knowledge of eternal self, Atman-Brahman and its Oneness with all others, that liberates. The Upanishad states in verse 3.1.4 that the Soul is the life of all things, and there is delight in this Soul (ƒÄtman). These early verses of the third Mundakam have been variously interpreted. To theist schools of Hinduism, the Isa is God. To non-theist schools of Hinduism, the Isa is Self. The theosophist Charles JohnstonCharles Johnston, The Mukhya Upanishads: Books of Hidden Wisdom, (1920-1931), The Mukhya Upanishads, Kshetra Books, (Reprinted in 2014), Archive of Mundaka Upanishad, pages 312-314 from Theosophical Quarterly journal explains the theistic view, not only in terms of schools of Hinduism, but as a mirroring the theism found in Christianity and other scriptures around the world. These verses, states Johnston, describe the sorrow that drowns those who are unaware or feel separated from their Lord. The disciple, when firmly understands his individuality, reaches for meaning beyond individuality, discovers Lord, discovers the wonderful complex life of Eternal God, states Johnston, and then he is on the way of \\"light of lights\\". Johnston quotes from Isaiah and Revelation, thus: \\"The Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory\\". Adi Shankara's commentary offers, as an example, an alternative interpretation in Hinduism. Shankara explains the non-dualistic view as follows: \\"By meditation and different paths of Yoga, man finds the other, not subject to the bondage of Samsara, unaffected by grief, ignorance, decay and death. He thinks thus: I am the atman, alike in all, seated in every living thing and not the other; this universe is mine, the lord of all; then he becomes absolved of all grief, released entirely from the ocean of grief, i.e. his object is accomplished\\".Mundaka Upanishad, in Upanishads and Sri Sankara's commentary - Volume 1: The Isa Kena and Mundaka, SS Sastri (Translator), University of Toronto Archives, pages 156-157 This is the state, asserts Shankara, free of grief, when man reaches the supreme equality which is identity with the Brahman. The equality in matters involving duality in certainly inferior to this, states Shankara. =Be ethical, know yourself, be tranquil - Third Mundakam= The last section of the Mundaka Upanishad asserts the ethical precepts necessary for man to attain the knowledge of the Brahman and thus liberation. Through ethical practices combined with meditation, must a man know his Self. Atman-Brahman is not perceived, states the Upanishad, by the eye, nor by speech, nor by other senses, not by penance, nor by karma of rituals. It is known to those whose nature has become purified by the serene light of knowledge, who meditate on it, who dwell unto it. This is the state, asserts Mundaka Upanishad, when one's thoughts is integrated and interwoven with one's body and all else. When thoughts are pure, the Self arises, states verse 3.1.9. This state of man is the state of Bhuti (‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡§ø, inner power, prosperity and happiness).Mundaka Upanishad, in Upanishads and Sri Sankara's commentary - Volume 1: The Isa Kena and Mundaka, SS Sastri (Translator), University of Toronto Archives, pages 166-167Eduard Roer, Mundaka Upanishad Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. XV, No. 41 and 50, Asiatic Society of Bengal, page 162 In the second section of the third Mundakam, the Upanishad asserts, \\"the soul cannot be realized by those who lack inner strength, nor by the careless or heedless, nor by devotion or false notions of austerity, nor by knowledge of the empirical. It is obtained by the soul by which it is desired. His soul reveals its own truth\\".Eduard Roer, Mundaka Upanishad Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. XV, No. 41 and 50, Asiatic Society of Bengal, page 163 Once such self- knowledge is reached, calmness of mind results, a life of liberation emerges, one becomes and behaves like the Brahman. He is beyond sorrow, he is beyond sin, he is in tranquil union with the soul of all.Robert Hume, Mundaka Upanishad, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 376-377 Reception The Mundaka Upanishad has been widely translated, as well as commented upon in Bhasya by ancient and medieval era Indian scholars such as Shankara and Anandagiri.Mundaka Upanishad, in Upanishads and Sri Sankara's commentary - Volume 1: The Isa Kena and Mundaka, SS Sastri (Translator), University of Toronto Archives, pages 90-180 Mundaka has been one of the most popular Upanishads, in past and present. Badarayana devotes three out of twenty eight adhikaranas to Mundaka Upanishad, while Shankara cites it 129 times in his commentary on the Brahmasutra.Paul Deussen (Translator), Sixty Upanisads of the Veda, Vol 2, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 569 Deussen states that this popularity is because of the literary accomplishment, purity in expression and the beauty of the verses in expressing the profound thoughts that are otherwise shared by other Upanishads of Hinduism.Paul Deussen (Translator), Sixty Upanisads of the Veda, Vol 2, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 569-570 Gough calls Mundaka Upanishad as \\"one of the most important documents in ancient Indian philosophy\\".AE Gough (2000), The Philosophy of the Upanishads and Ancient Indian Metaphysics, Routledge, , pages 97-99 It encapsulates the Vedic teachings, states Gough, that \\"he that meditates upon any deity as a being other than himself has no knowledge, and is mere victim to the gods\\", and \\"there is no truth in the many, all truth is in the one; and this one that alone is the Self, the inmost essence of all things, that vivifies all sentiencies and permeates all things. This is the pure bliss, and it dwells within the heart of every creature\\". Ross, in his chapters on \\"meaning of life in Hinduism\\", frequently cites Mundaka Upanishad, and states it to be an example of ancient efforts in India to refine tools and discipline of realizing liberation or Moksha.Floyd H Ross (2013), The Meaning of Life in Hinduism and Buddhism, Routledge, , page 48, also 39-47 Johnston states that the ancient message in Mundaka Upanishad is relevant to the modern age where \\"search for and application of Truth\\" alone often predominates the fields of science. Mundaka Upanishad reminds the central importance of Truth in its third Mundakam, yet it also emphasizes the need for \\"beauty and goodness\\", because \\"truth, beauty and goodness\\" together, states Johnston, create arts, music, poetry, painting, meaning and spiritual answers.Charles Johnston, The Mukhya Upanishads: Books of Hidden Wisdom, (1920-1931), The Mukhya Upanishads, Kshetra Books, (Reprinted in 2014), Archive of Mundaka Upanishad, pages 313-315 Jacobs has called Mundaka Upanishad as profound, and counts it as one of the essential philosophical foundations of Hinduism.Alan Jacobs (2012), The Principal Upanishads: The Essential Philosophical Foundation of Hinduism, , Chapter 7 Cultural impact Emblem of India with tagline phrase from the Mundaka Upanishad. The Mundaka Upanishad is the source of the phrase Satyameva Jayate, which is the national motto of India. It appears in its national emblem with four lions.

It is essentially a content market for co-producing, buying, selling, financing and distributing entertainment content. It provides the people involved in the TV, film, digital and audiovisual content, production and distribution industry a market conference and networking forum to discover future trends and trade content rights on a global level. This event is very closely related to the MIPCOM event, but retains its distinct focus. The MIPCOM event takes place in the same venue in October each year.  History  MIP-TV was started in Lyon, France, in 1963 three years after MIFED, the world‚Äôs first audiovisual market, had started in Milan, Italy. The first MIP-TV was attended by 119 companies from 19 countries. In 1965, after a one-year hiatus, MIP-TV moved to Cannes, using the town‚Äôs ‚Äúold‚Äù Palais for the exhibition floors. In 1982 the market moved to the new Palais, while the old one became a hotel. In 1987 the company that organized the market, MIDEM, was sold to the UK‚Äôs Television South (TVS) for ¬£5 million. Two years later, TVS sold MIDEM to Reed Exhibitions (for a reported $20 million), which renamed it Reed MIDEM.http://www.videoageinternational.com/articles/2013/04/mip50.htm  Conferences  Conference panelists and keynotes include CEOs from all the major global media companies like: Leslie Moonves, CBS (US), Jana Bennett BBC (UK), Gerhard Zeiler RTL Group (Luxembourg), Harry Sloan MGM (US), Subhash Chandra ZEE Networks (India), Hyun-Oh Yoo SK Communications/Cyworld (Korea), Paula Wagner at United Artists (US), Ronnie Screwvala UTV (India), Philip Rosedale Second Life (US), Ben Silverman NBC (US), Emilio Azcarraga Televisa (Mexico), Mike Volpi Joost (US), Ken Rutkowski, Wayne Scholes Redtouch Media (US) KenRadio Broadcasting (US).

Ivan Andreevich was a member of prominent Tolstoy family, son of Andrey Vasiliyevich Tolstoy and Solomonida Miloslavskaya, older brother of Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy, distant relation of Maria Miloslavskaya (first wife of tzar Aleksey Mikhailovich). The royal relations became very dangerous for brothers Tolstoys after Peter I took the power, as he hated his half-sister Sophia and distrusted all her Miloslavsky relatives. Despite this Peter respected the abilities of the Tolstoy brothers and allowed them to follow a military career: Ah head, head, were you not so clever I should have cut it off long ago - he actually said to Pyotr Tolstoy. In 1703 Ivan Tolstoy was appointed Governor of Azov - the fortress and naval base on the Black Sea that was critically important in the confrontation between Russia and Turkey, bands of Don Cossacks and Kondraty Bulavin uprising. In 1708 Bulavin's forces accompanied by Turks and cossacks stormed Azov, but Tolstoy's troops were victorious and not only kept the fortress but according to historian Nikolay Tolstoy captured and hanged Bulavin himself. (According to other sources, Bulavin was killed by a renegade among his own cossacks). Ivan Tolstoy also marched his troops to take part in the Battle of Poltava in 1709. In 1710 Ivan was replaced as a Governor of Azov by Admiral Apraxin. In 1712 after the disastrous Pruth Campaign, Azov was surrendered to Turkey. As a condition of peace, Turkey requested that the governor Ivan Tolstoy personally moved to Azov and surrendered the fortress to Turkey representative Achmed Pascha. Despite concerns that he might share the fate of his diplomat brother Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy, who was at that time thrown into Turkey's notorious prison Seven Towers, Ivan travelled to Azov and on the way back became ill and died in Cherkassk on 25 August 1713.

South East England and the Home Counties South East England and the Home Counties (the counties bordering London) tend to reflect the interface between the London region and other regional accents. Affluent districts are associated with a modified Received Pronunciation (RP) accent, reflecting their traditional popularity with upper middle and upper-class residents which has spread throughout more social classes broadly in rural areas with commuting access to London. Less affluent areas have traditionally mainstream London accents (that is, variants of the Estuary English accent) that grade into southern rural outside urban areas. =Regional dialect levelling (\\"supralocalisation\\") in the South-East of England= Commentators report widespread homogenisation in the south-east (Kerswill & Williams 2000; Britain 2002). The features present a levelling between the extremes of Estuarine pronunciation and careful Received Pronunciation and except where an intuitive neutral parity position exists, they include: * Reduced amount of h-dropping * Increased amount of th-fronting * goat fronting to * \\"RP\\" variant in mouth * Low-back onset of price , lowered/unrounded from , or * Raising of onset of face to * Fronting of goose to * Fronting of foot * Lowering and backing of trap * Backing of strut Wells notes traditional aspects of rural south-eastern speech as lengthened in trap wordsJohn C.

Wells in Trudgill ed., Language in the British Isles, pages 60-61, Cambridge University Press, 1984 =London= Accents are nonrhotic, that is, (phonetically ) occurs only before vowels. General characteristics of all major London accents include: * diphthongal realisation of and , for example beat , boot (this can also be a monophthong: ) * diphthongal realization of in open syllables, for example bore , paw versus a monophthongal realization in closed syllables, for example board , pause . But the diphthong is retained before inflectional endings, so that board and pause often contrast with bored and paws . * lengthening of in words such as man, sad, bag, hand (cf. can, had, lad): split of into two phonemes and . See bad‚Äìlad split. * an allophone of before \\"dark L\\" , namely , for example whole versus holy . But the is retained when the addition of a suffix turns the \\"dark L\\" clear, so that wholly can contrast with holy. It is also common to hear young Londoners drop \\"(to) the\\" from sentences related to going places (such as: Do you want to go cinema?/Do you want to go West End?). Sloane-speak and Rah (slang) Sloane-speak or Sloaney-speech is spoken by the upper middle and upper classes, ultralocalised in Inner South-West and West London by a range of inhabitants of the very expensive private housing in and around Sloane Street and Sloane Square, Chelsea, Mayfair and alongside Marylebone High Street.These were also singled out as the districts lived in by the subjects of the fly-on-the-wall documentary Made in Chelsea (2012) The speakers of Sloaney are sometimes defined as Sloane Rangers. Levelling aspects of the speech of the young aristocracy were heightened in the early 1980s by the 'Princess Diana' accent and effect yet drew upon public school and historic vocabulary to form a distinct Sloane-speak of the young and wealthy soon dubbed 'Sloane Rangers'. Here aristocrats' clipped Received Pronunciation was modified in this particular speech community as the young upper and upper-middle classes, like Diana and contemporaries, increasingly settled as singles in the 'muesli belt' round Sloane Square on the border of Belgravia and Chelsea, Chelsea's King's Road into Fulham and even in expensive parts of Putney, Richmond, London, Wandsworth and Battersea. Sloanies followed the 1960s fashion boom of King's Road and became lesser cultural icons for a time in fashion, as well as seeking out idiosyncratic cultural pursuits and language. Features, whether affected or throwback to particular aristocratic shorthands include 'jah' for yes; \\"(s)he's rairly, rairly (really, really) nice', or shortened ('Nick's' for Harvey Nichols; 'Rods' for Harrods; 'Fred's' for Fortnum and Mason's). Hyperbole was for a period rife ('frightfully', 'ghastly', 'appalling', 'thanks awfully'), but subject to influences from more demotic speech of the capital, particularly towards its fringes.\\" Reflecting national upper class moves towards slightly less formal pronunciation,See Received Pronunciation: Historical Variation or indeed the middle-dialect influence of Sloane-speak, end-of-sentence glottal stop and final-t sounds came into the speech of younger Royalty: for instance in the speech of Diana and Prince Edward; and vocoids for \\"l\\" as in '; all juxtaposed against borrowed vocabulary from opposing dialects such as 'bog' (toilet) and 'yonks' (a long time). To many middle-class Londoners, however, the often drawled pronunciation of the Sloane Rangers was deemed as 'marked' or 'affected' as the Queen's, so closely identified was with a particular social group: the rah-rah accent and dialect, named in 1982, coupled with the most obscure vocabulary became Rah (slang), synonymous with snobbery. The once trendy rah concepts faded into fashion oblivion during the Cool Britannia decade but in the late 2000s staged a comeback with slightly different, edgier, rougher forms continuing to develop: *\\"Sloane-speak has grown edgier. Nancy Mitford's vocabulary was updated last year by a wealth of new words compiled into a dictionary by Olivia Stewart- Liberty and Peter York (author of the original Sloane Ranger Handbook). But the past few months have yielded telling additions: \\"disrevelled\\" refers to a Sloane's appearance after a heavy night at Boujis; \\"dorleybowl\\" is a bad haircut (in frequent usage, as you can imagine); \\"squippy\\" is the perpetual state of the Sloane (it means \\"hyperactive\\"). Then there's \\"jollop\\" (to go out and enjoy oneself) and \\"floordrobe\\", the place young Sloanes choose to store their clothes ‚Äì i.e., on the floor. Oddly, there don't seem to be any jolly, japeish terms for \\"the workplace\\", \\"grocery shopping\\" and \\"bill paying\\"\\".OK, yo! Sloane-speak's gone street ‚Äì Celia Walden The Daily Telegraph 17 Jul 2008 'London from Punk to Blair' By Joe Kerr, Andrew Gibson, Mike Seaborne ‚Äì Reaktion Books, 2003 Cockney Cockney is an accent traditionally from the working classes of the areas immediately surrounding the City of London (most famously including the East End). It is characterised by a number of phonological differences from RP: * The dental fricatives are replaced with labiodental , for example think * The diphthong is monophthongized to , for example south * H-dropping, for example house * Replacement of in the middle or end of a word with a glottal stop; for example hit * Diphthong shift of to (for example beet ), to (for example bait ), to (for example bite ), and to (for example, boy . * Vocalisation of (dark L) to , for example, people Multicultural London English Multicultural London English (abbreviated MLE), colloquially called Blockney or Jafaican, is a dialect (and/or sociolect) of English that emerged in the late 20th century. It is spoken mainly by youths in inner London. Jamaican-London The speech of Jamaicans, or children of Jamaican parents, in London shows interesting combinations of the Jamaican accent with the London accent. For example, in Jamaican English, is replaced by , for example both . In London, word-final is realised as , as mentioned above. In Jamaican-London speech, glottalization of applies also to from , for example both of them . Hypercorrections like for foot are also heard from Jamaicans.John C. Wells Jamaican pronunciation in London The Philological Society (1973). John C. Wells's dissertation, Jamaican pronunciation in London, was published by the Philological Society in 1973. =Essex= Essex, is usually associated with Estuary English, mainly in urban areas receiving an influx of East London migrants. The non-urban Essex accent, generally found in the north of the county, is more closely related to those of East Anglia. Residents of places within Essex such as Basildon, Billericay and Grays are more likely to have an accent similar to the traditional 'Cockney' accent, due to the proximity to East London and East End migration to these areas since WWII. =Estuary= Estuary English is the name given to an accent (or group of accents) that may informally be considered a compromise between Cockney and RP. It retains some aspects of Cockney, such as the vocalisation of (dark L) to , and yod-coalescence in stressed syllables (for example, duty ) and replacement of with (the glottal stop) in weak positions, or occasionally with d). =East Hertfordshire= The east Herts accent traditionally spoken is akin to a native central/north Essex rural accent. The largest towns in particular have the diverse sociolect variants of Received Pronunciation and Estuary English as seen in London, with smaller settlements tending towards the traditional dialects or variants of RP. =West Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire= Before the 21st Century, West Herts and Buckinghamshire tended to have r-coloured vowels; for instance, here the established dialects made a distinction between the words farther and father ( and ). However, in recent times, strong influences have come from London's Estuary English, thanks to the influx of post-World War II migrants from across London, and thus Estuary English is now the norm across West Herts and Buckinghamshire (though some of the older dialect can be heard in older generations, particularly in more rural areas). =Hampshire= Hampshire is often missed in dialect definitions and placed on borderlines between South East and West England. In country areas and Southampton, the local accent can still be heard amongst some speakers, for example by John Arlott, Lord Denning and Reg Presley although the use of the v sound in \\"field\\" has declined. Since the 1960s, particularly in Andover and Basingstoke, the local accent has changed reflecting the arrival of East Londoners relocated by London County Council. It can be argued that Hampshire is a borderline county moving East, linguistically. In the northeast part of the county, the accent tends to have more of a 'twang', leading people from other areas to even mistake the speaker's origins as being Australia, New Zealand or South Africa. Portsmouth The traditional Portsmouth dialect (affectionately known as the Pompey dialect, and less favourably as Just Chav Talk) is an oddity and somewhat an isolate. It stands well apart both structurally and phonetically from all other local English varieties around it. The traditional origin story is that the Dockyards attracted an influx of East Londoners at the turn of the 20th century and the accent is based in \\"Dockyard slang\\". Though structurally it is based around an East London model, it has retained a lot of traditional Hampshire features. Whilst it follows the consonant rules of Estuary English closely, the vowel sounds are quite different. The dialect is not a recent phenomenon, and can be heard in the speech of local people in their nineties. The surrounding accents geographically are quite different, and few contain as many of the \\"Estuary-isms\\" found in the Pompey dialect and some of those may actually originate from Portsmouth, rather than Estuary English. =Bedfordshire= As with neighbouring Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire has a variety of accents. In the Luton/Dunstable Urban Area, the accent is similar to a London accent, and it is often mistaken as one. This is because of the overflow of Londoners and their subsequent generations in the area. The Lutonian accent is not as strong as an accent from Essex. In Mid Bedfordshire the more traditional accent of the area is still held. Especially by those of an older generation, or in very remote areas. While in North Bedfordshire especially near the border with Northamptonshire it can be argued that the dialect is one which sounds more like East Midlands English, Bedford itself is linguistically diverse, reflecting the more varied demographics of the town (compared with the surrounding villages). A typical Bedford accent is more similar to a Londonian Luton or Dunstable accent, due largely to movement of people from these places to Bedford. =Kent= Foot-strut split isogloss Accents today are a cross between Estuary English and Received Pronunciation which both evolve over time and are becoming significantly more similar; where towards the former, accents have been strongly influenced by proximity to towns in the London Gateway involved in heavy trades, fishing and repairs and merchant sides of the Royal Navy, which was concentrated in Greenwich and Chatham. This corresponds to the name of the dialect which refers to the Thames Estuary. 'H dropping' is in general rare, as in the other Home Counties, but 't dropping' or substitution with a weaker vowel is common. However of particular note, one vowel usage is unique to West Kent which is the realization of the phoneme.. =Surrey= A traditional Surrey accent again has r-coloured vowels while being entirely nonrhotic. Estuary English is common throughout the county, particularly in the northern areas bordering on London, although many large settlements further south into Surrey, such as Guildford and Woking, share in variants of estuary English. Furthest north into Surrey is the borough of Spelthorne, where the accent is indistinguishable (as formerly part of Middlesex) from the London accent due to it sharing borders with the London boroughs of Hounslow, Richmond-upon- Thames and Hillingdon. =Jafaican= Jafaican, also known as Tikkiny or less commonly \\"Hood-Chat\\" is part accent, part dialect, from around the mid-1990s, and influenced not only by British black urban culture, but by rap music. This variant is used by the youth of all races as a 'street' patois, American English influences (such as the greeting \\"Yo!\\"), but also Caribbean patterns such as \\"aks\\" (rather than \\"ask\\"). The dialect is used mainly by young people, regardless of racial background. It can be heard in many parts of England, but especially around London. Rural South and West Country This family of similar strongly rhotic accents, now perceived as rural, originally extended across much of southern England south of the broad A isogloss, but they are now most often found west of a line roughly from Shropshire via Oxfordshire. Their shared characteristics have been caricatured as Mummerset. They persist most strongly in areas that remain largely rural with a largely indigenous population, particularly the West Country. In many other areas they are declining because of RP and Estuary accents moving to the area; for instance, strong Isle of Wight accents tend to be more prevalent in older speakers. As well as rhoticity, here are common features of West County accents: * The diphthong (as in price) realised as or , sounding more like the diphthong in Received Pronunciation choice. * The diphthong (as in mouth) realised as , with a starting point close to the vowel in Received Pronunciation dress. * The vowel (as in lot) realised as an unrounded vowel , as in many forms of American English. * In traditional West Country accents, the voiceless fricatives (as in sat, farm, think, shed respectively) are often voiced to , giving pronunciations like \\"Zummerzet\\" for Somerset, \\"varm\\" for farm, \\"zhure\\" for sure, etc. * In the Bristol area a vowel at the end of a word is often followed by an intrusive dark l, . Hence the old joke about the three Bristolian sisters Evil, Idle, and Normal (written Eva, Ida, and Norma). L is pronounced darkly where it is present, too, which means that in Bristolian rendering, 'idea' and 'ideal' are homophones. * H-dropping in South Devon and Cornwall, \\"Berry 'Aid\\" for Berry Head (in Brixham, South Devon) In traditional Southern rural accents, the voiceless fricatives always remain voiceless, which is the main difference from West Country accents. East Anglia Features which can be found in East Anglian English (especially in Norfolk) include: * Yod-dropping after all consonants: beautiful may be pronounced , often represented as \\"bootiful\\" or \\"bewtiful\\", huge as , and so on.There are more details on , written by Norfolk-born linguist Peter Trudgill * Absence of the long mid merger between Early Modern English (as in toe, moan, road, boat) and (as in tow, mown, rowed). The vowel of toe, moan, road, boat may be realised as , so that boat may sound to outsiders like boot. * Glottal stop frequent for . * The diphthong (as in price) realised as , sounding very much like the diphthong in Received Pronunciation choice. * The vowel (as in lot) realised as an unrounded vowel , as in many forms of American English. * Merger of the vowels of near and square (RP and ), making chair and cheer homophones. * East Anglian accents are generally non-rhotic. There are differences between and even within areas of East Anglia: the Norwich accent has distinguishing aspects from the Norfolk dialect that surrounds itchiefly in the vowel sounds. The accents of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire are different from the Norfolk accent.Some examples of the Norfolk accent (with dialectal words thrown in) at References Category:English language in England .

He designed more than 1,000 projects including the Gateway Arch National Park in St. Louis and the Art Institute of Chicago's South Garden.  Life and career  Kiley was born in Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts, where his father was a construction manager, grew up in West Roxbury, Boston, and in 1930 graduated from high school in Jamaica Plain. In 1932, he began a four-year apprenticeship with landscape architect Warren Manning, working without pay for the first year, then at 50 cents per hour, during which he learned the fundamentals of office practice and developed an interest in the role of plants in design, sparking his later creative and innovative use of plants in the landscape. From 1936 to 1938, Kiley was a special student in the design program at Harvard University, while continuing work with Manning for 30 hours per week. Among his classmates and friends were Garrett Eckbo and James C. Rose, who also became influential landscape architects. After two years at Harvard, upon Manning's death and the dissolution of his practice, Kiley left without graduating. He worked briefly for the National Park Service in Concord, New Hampshire, and later the United States Housing Authority, where he met architect Louis Kahn. On Kahn's advice, Kiley left the Housing Authority in 1940 to become a licensed practitioner of architecture. From 1943 to 1945, Kiley served in the U.S. Army as Captain in the Presentations Branch of the Office of Strategic Services, becoming its director after architect Eero Saarinen stepped down. At the end of World War II, Kiley designed the courtroom where the Nuremberg Trials were held. While in Europe, he visited Chateau de Villandry as well as the work of Andr√© Le N√¥tre at Sceaux, Chantilly, Versailles, and Vaux-le-Vicomte, whose formality and geometric layout shaped his future Classical Modernist style. Following the war, Kiley found himself one of the only modern landscape architects in the postwar building boom. In California, his friend Garrett Eckbo, Thomas Church and others were developing and practicing the modernist style. Kiley re-established his practice in Franconia, New Hampshire, and later moved it to Charlotte, Vermont. In 1947, in collaboration with Saarinen, Kiley entered and won the competition to design for the Gateway Arch National Park (then known as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial), a high-profile job that launched his career as a landscape architect. Kiley‚Äôs first essentially modern landscape design was the Miller Garden in 1955, which is now owned by the Indianapolis Museum of Art and known as the Miller House and Garden. Among his other masterworks are the Fountain Place in Dallas, Texas; the NationsBank Plaza in Tampa, Florida; the United States Air Force Academy; the Oakland Museum; Independence Mall in Philadelphia; and the Dallas Museum of Art. He completed more than 900 projects, which received countless awards. In 1997, he was presented with the National Medal of Arts. In his office, he hired and inspired designers such as Richard Haag, Peter Hornbeck, Peter Ker Walker, Peter Schaudt and Ian Tyndal. The unique geometric layout of allees, bosques, water, paths, orchards, and lawns characterize Dan Kiley‚Äôs design. To Kiley, regular geometry lay at the heart of his design. Like his predecessors, Le Corbusier and Le N√¥tre, Kiley believed that geometry was an inherent part of man. It was the structure man could use to gain comprehension and create stabilization of his surroundings. He also firmly believed that man was a part of nature, rather than being separate from it. Rather than copying and trying to imitate the curvilinear forms of nature he asserted mathematical order to the landscape. Kiley‚Äôs landscapes overstepped their boundaries rather than ending elements neatly on a suggested edge. He called this approach, slippage, or an extension beyond the implied boundary, creating ambiguous relationships in the landscape. Dan Kiley was a landscape architect made famous by his hundreds of distinguished works of landscape design, and inspires many students and professionals in the field of landscape architecture.  Exhibitions  In 2013, The Cultural Landscape Foundation (TCLF) organized a traveling, photographic exhibition titled The Landscape Architecture Legacy of Dan Kiley, which features 45 newly commissioned photographs of 27 of Kiley‚Äôs more than 1,000 designs. It is currently on a multi-year, national tour.

Together with the villages of Chinderah and Fingal, it is a tourist destination that provides beach and estuary access for swimming, surfing, fishing and water sports. View of a holiday resort, Kingscliff, 2009 Its main street, Marine Parade, contains many cafes, shops and accommodation located directly across from Kingscliff beach and creek. The town also has two primary schools and a state high school. An oceanway allows pedestrians and cyclists to move from the historic centre of town out to the emerging new communities along the Tweed Coast in a sustainable manner. Kingscliff was the home to Peter and Jeremy Oxley who formed the 1980s band, The Sunnyboys. A scene from the film Aquamarine was filmed on Marine Parade in late 2007. The main Kingscliff beach has been severely affected by erosion, with portions of the caravan park and beachside carparks being threatened or reclaimed by the sea. In December 2014, the state environment ministry announced it would split the $300,000 cost with Tweed Shire of an environmental impact study for a plan to build a 500-metre seawall and fill in the beach with imported sand.\\"Kingscliff seawall study funded\\", Echo Daily In March 2016 work began on the Kingscliff Foreshore Revitalisation Project which will be rolled out in 3 stages. Stage 1 involves building a new seawall to save the Cudgen Headland Surf Life Saving Club, Kingscliff Beach Holiday Park and Kingscliff Beach Bowls Club from erosion. Stage 2 is to refurbish Kingscliff Beach Holiday Park, meaning a roll back of camping facilities with a focus on cabins. Stage 3 will be focused on creating a more community orientated space for tourists and locals alike with the development of Kingscliff Central Park which is anticipated to become the new social hub of Kingscliff and make the transition from the main street to the beach more streamlined. This stage will also mean far better beach views for businesses on Marine Parade. Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 7,464 people in Kingscliff. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.8% of the population. * 78.9% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 4.5% and New Zealand 2.6%. * 90.3% of people spoke only English at home. * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 29.0%, Catholic 24.7% and Anglican 19.7%.  Sport and recreation  A number of well-known sporting teams represent the local area, including the Cudgen Hornets, the local rugby league club who play home games at Ned Byrne Field. In September 2009, Kingscliff hosted a stage of the World Rally Championship. Kingscliff Wolves Soccer Club is an Australian soccer club founded in 1968. The club's home ground is the Walter Peate Oval. The club competes in the Gold Coast Premier League, where it has been one of the leading sides for the past few decades. There are many bike paths for local cyclists through the parks along Kingscliff's beaches. The neighboring town of Salt is accessible via a bike path.

It co-starred Franco Nero, Karl Geary and Iain Glen, and was directed by Julian Jarrold. The role was created specifically for Mirren, as a means for her to try something a bit different from her Inspector Tennison character on the popular Prime Suspect series. The series was a collaborative effort of Granada Television (UK) and PBS (U.S.). It was broadcast on the ITV network from 7 to 8 December 1997 in the UK and in the U.S. PBS's Masterpiece Theatre 26 April 1998. Plot summary Maggie Sheridan (Mirren), a washed-up blues vocalist from the 1960s who had long since stopped performing, had settled into a comfortable life on the Dublin estate of the father of her childhood friend, Sir Charles Stafford (Iain Cuthbertson). When Sir Charles is murdered in what appears to be a bungled robbery (in which a valuable sixteenth-century painting is stolen), Maggie is drawn into the world of illegal art trade in an effort to solve the mystery and avenge her friend's murder, donning the persona of Polish Countess Magdelena Kreschinska√°. The story centers around Judith Beheading Holofernes, the masterwork of Artemisia Gentileschi, who was a 17th-century female Italian painter who survived a rape. The painting fictionally travels to Dublin and New York City, and Gentileschi's tragic story eventually figures into the plot. There are other visual references to notable paintings in the film.

He most commonly held the rank of major, although the appointment was also held by captains, and was head of the brigade's \\"G - Operations and Intelligence\\" section directly, and oversaw the two other branches, \\"A ‚Äì Administration\\" and \\"Q ‚Äì Quartermaster\\". Intentionally ranked lower than the lieutenant colonels commanding the brigade's combat battalions, his role was to expand on, detail and execute the intentions of the commanding brigadier. In 1913, staff captains of artillery in the British Army were re-styled as brigade majors to bring them into line with cavalry and infantry practice. In the 21st century, the title is no longer used except in the Household Division and in divisional-level artillery headquarters. As of 2014 the title is still retained by HQ London District. During World War I, the brigade major was reportedly \\"a key personality who affected the health and happiness of the battalions.\\" He was in most frequent contact with the front-line troops and was responsible for planning brigade operations. Many brigade majors held the rank of captain, e.g., the future prime minister, Anthony Eden, was a brigade major at the age of twenty-one. The practice of using brigade majors has continued in some Commonwealth armies, such as that of India. The position was a standard fixture in the British Army and Canadian Army until between 1982 and 1984 when the NATO system was adopted and brigade G-3 (Operations), also known as \\"Chief of Staff\\", replaced the brigade major.

It currently teaches grades 4‚Äì9. Established in 2003, the school operates at two sites. Grades 4-5 are located at the Bel Aire campus, and students in grades 6-9 are located at the Lakeview campus. Students at CGCS are required to wear a uniform. Calgary Girls Charter School is renowned for its \\"Go Girls\\" curriculum in which girls talk about image, bullying, and the amount of pressure placed on girls. The CGCS is administered by the Calgary Girls' School Society, a non-profit organization dedicated exclusively to administering the school. As one of 13 charter schools in Alberta, CGCS operates with its own board of directors, and is accountable directly to the Minister of Education. As a public charter school, it receives the same provincial funding per student of any public school. With public funding comes the obligation to accept any female student that it is able to accommodate, without charging tuition. Like any public Alberta school, it is allowed to charge fees, but they are not tied to the right of admission. Opposition The Calgary Board of Education (CBE) and its main union are generally opposed to the idea of charter schools. Organizers of the CGCS initially (as required by law) applied to get the same school run under the authority of the CBE. However certain policies of the CGCS compelled the CBE to reject them. For instance, one CGCS policy is to give parents a more significant role in evaluating teachers.

Despite what its name may suggest, Virginia's warbler is not actually named after the American State of Virginia, which makes sense as the birds' typical range only reaches as far east as the state of Texas. The bird's common eastern range is central and southern mountains of Colorado, central Wyoming, and central and western New Mexico. The bird was named for Virginia Anderson, the wife of an army surgeon who discovered the bird at Fort Burgwin, New Mexico, in 1858. When Spencer Fullerton Baird of the Smithsonian Institution fully described the bird for science in 1860 he honored the wishes of the warbler's discoverer and designated Virginia to be both the bird's common and scientific name. Description Virginia's warbler is a small bird, only in length. It is mainly gray in color, with a lighter colored under-belly and a white eye ring. The rump and undertail coverts are yellow. They also have a yellow patch on their breast and a partially hidden dark reddish crest. Females are slightly duller, with less yellow on breast. Virginia's warbler can be easily mistaken for the rare Colima warbler, but it is smaller, has a more yellow rump, and is more widespread. Colima Warbler also lacks yellow breast patch. Life history Virginia's warbler is common in dense oak and pinyon woodlands and brushy streamside hills at altitudes ranging from . It summers in the south-western United States and will migrate as far south as Belize during the winter, as well as stopping in several Caribbean islands such as the Bahamas, Cuba, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Nests are built on the ground, hidden amongst dead leaves and tufts of grass at the base of a shrub or young tree. The nest is cup-shaped and constructed from moss, grass, strips of bark, and roots. The female will lay between three and five eggs, which are white in color and dotted with fine brown speckles. Young are attended to by both sexes, but incubation period and other nesting habits are mostly unknown. References * Vermivora virginiae, ITIS Report Further reading =Books= * Olson, C. R., and T. E.

She is known for her photographs and videos of her hybridized future self, often presented in various guises and featuring traditional Japanese motifs. Her work often explores themes of technology, spirituality and transcendence. In 2010, she founded the Faou Foundation, an art nonprofit based in New York City. Early life and education Mariko Mori was born in Tokyo, Japan in 1967. She comes from a wealthy family; her father is an inventor and technician, and her mother is a historian of European Art. While studying at Bunka Fashion College in Tokyo in the late 1980s, Mori worked as a fashion model. In 1989, she moved to London to study at the Byam Shaw School of Art and then the Chelsea College of Art and Design, from where she graduated in 1992.Hallmark, Kara Kelley. 2007. Encyclopedia of Asian American artists. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press. p. 129. After graduating, she moved to New York City and participated in the Whitney Independent Study Program at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Career Mori's early work references traditional Japanese culture and ancient history but is characterized by futuristic themes and characters. Her early photography is heavily influenced by cosplay. Fantastic deities, robots, alien creatures and spaceships are featured in videos and photographs with the artist herself dressed up in various self-made costumes as characters. Present throughout her career is a fascination with technology and spirituality, with technology as a means of transcending and transforming consciousness and self. Mori's early works, such as photograph Play with Me (1994), use her own body as the subject, and she costumes herself as a sexualized, technological alien woman in everyday scenes. While her tableaus are fantastic and futuristic, the role played by the female characters she portrayed were often traditional, gendered roles such as a waitress in Tea Ceremony (1995), a futuristic version of the female Buddhist deity Kichijoten in Pure Land (1996-1998), or a female Japanese pop star in Birth of a Star. Mori attributes her fascination with consciousness and death to experiencing sleep paralysis in her early-twenties for several hours which left her unsure if she was alive or dead. The juxtaposition of Eastern mythology with Western culture is a common theme in Mori's works, often through layering photography and digital imaging, such as in her 1995 installation Birth of a Star. Later works, such as Nirvana show her as a goddess, transcending her early roles via technology and image, and abandoning realistic urban scenes for more alien landscapes. At the 47th Venice Biennale (1997), Mori had two works exhibited, a photo collage titled, Empty Dream (1995) shown in the Japanese Pavillon, and the 3-D video installation, Nirvana (1997) which was shown in the Nordic Pavillon. Mori's work is featured in many public museum collections, including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and others.  Personal life  She is married to composer Ken Ikeda. They have created collaborative work together, with Ikeda composing music and/or sound for many of Mori's pieces.  Work  = Play With Me (1994) = Standing outside a Tokyo toy store, Mori dressed herself as a cyborg‚Äîwith light blue hair in long ponytails, metallic blue hard-shell plastic top, silver plastic gloves, and a dress. Mori dresses similarly to the toys sold inside the store, while being ignored by the patrons who are entering to her left. = Subway (1994) = Mori stood in a Tokyo subway car dressed as if she just landed from outer space. She was dressed in a silver metallic costume with a headset, microphone, and push-buttons on her forearm. This transformation‚Äîalong with Play With Me‚Äîwas to explore different constructed identities. = Empty Dream (1995) = Mori manipulates a photo of a real public swimming place as she inserts herself in a blue plastic mermaid costume in several locations within the scene. This image refers to, among other things, the rising of technology and philosophy around the creation of man through biotechnology. This work was one of two by Mori that were featured at the 47th Venice Biennale (1997). = Oneness (2003) = Oneness, which was first exhibited at Deitch Projects, New York, in 2003, is also the title of a group of six alien sculptures‚Äîmade from soft, skin-like material‚Äîthat hold each other‚Äôs hands in a circle. They are sensitive to human touch, lighting up when hugged. Oneness presents the dimensions of spirituality, photography and fashion into a deep look on the originality of the artist's skill hence the usage of technology's brand new trends. The outlook designs of Oneness gathers the capacity nevertheless the ability to use advanced technology knowledge converted to some sort of mystic and UFOs.Deitch Projects Including in Oneness you can find some sub-works such as the Wave-UFO, a 6.000 kg dome where the visitor, once inside it, can see projected paintings reworked with computer graphics and then transformed into photographs in the interior dome of the Wave UFO. Conceptualization and prototyping of the Wave UFO was realized during Mori's residency at Eyebeam Art+Technology Center in Chelsea, New York. = Rebirth = Rebirth is an exhibition from works spanning a number of years that was first shown in London at the Royal Academy of Art in 2012 and came to Japan Society in New York City in 2013. It is seen as a major departure from her previous work in that has far less to do with contemporary media and influences. One such example in this collection is Flat Stones (2006), which is a collection of ceramic rocks arranged similarly to a Jomon archaeological site. Mori also took inspiration from ancient Celtic practices, notably the stone circles in her Transcircle 1.1 (2004), a group of LED lit columns that periodically shift color. Such engagement with prehistoric cultures derive from her search for universal values shared by humanity. Faou Foundation In 2010, Mori founded a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, the Faou Foundation, (the word \\"faou\\" is a neologism created by Mori meaning \\"eternal light\\"). Mori is listed as founder and president of the organization. Inspired by Buddhism and ecology, the Faou Foundation's mission is to create six art installations around the world as homages to the natural environment of each locale.

With interests in music and literature, Conly entered Williams College in 1935 but left in his second year. He then went through a period that he referred to as his \\"breakdown\\", briefly working in Albany, New York, before going back to his family in disgrace.

He was ineligible for conscription during World War II, as unfit due to physical and mental ailments (classification 4-F in later terms). He then covered national and city news for the Washington Times-Herald beginning in 1944 and later the Pathfinder, a news magazine. In 1951, he began working as an editor and writer for National Geographic, a job which was to take him around the world. From 1970 until his death he was a senior assistant editor there. =Fiction writer= In the 1960s Conly developed glaucoma. Because he could no longer drive to work, he and his family moved in 1963 from Virginia closer to his office in Washington, D.C. In the time he saved from not having to commute, he began to write children's stories. Conly is best known for writing novels under the name \\"Robert C. O'Brien\\", from his mother's maiden name, used because his National Geographic contract \\"forbid him from publishing with any other company\\". His first books were the children's stories The Silver Crown (1968) and Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH (1971). He won the 1972 Newbery Medal for the latter and his comments at the American Library Association annual conference were read by his editor Jean Karl to preserve his anonymity.

Born in Vienna in 1903, he was the son of Max Graf (1873‚Äì1958), and Olga H√∂nig. His father was an Austrian author, critic, musicologist and member of Sigmund Freud's circle of friends. Herbert Graf was the Little Hans discussed in Freud's 1909 study Analysis of a Phobia in a Five-year-old Boy. 'Little Hans' This was one of just a few case studies which Freud published. In his introduction to the case, he had in the years before the case been encouraging his friends and associates, including Graf's parents, to collect observations on the sexual life of children in order to help him develop his theory of infantile sexuality. Thus Max Graf had been sending notes about his child's development to Freud before Herbert's fear of horses emerged. As \\"Little Hans\\", he was the subject of Freud's early but extensive study of castration anxiety and the Oedipus complex. Freud saw Herbert only once and did not analyze the child, but rather supervised the child's father, who carried out the analysis and sent extensive notes to Freud. In the published version, Herbert's father's account is abridged and punctuated by Freud's comments. When he was four years old, Herbert was witness to a frightening event when he was at the local park in the company of the family's maid. A cart horse pulling a heavy load collapsed. Herbert became fearful of going out into the street, with his fear focused on horses and heavily loaded vehicles, which he was afraid would fall over. This fear was interpreted as a neurosis (equinophobia). Herbert's father initially attributes the neurosis to \\"sexual over-excitement caused by his mother's caresses\\" and fear caused by the large penises of horses. While not rejecting these explanations, Freud gradually encourages the father also to understand Herbert's disorder in terms of the anxiety caused by the arrival of his younger sister and an inadequately satisfied curiosity as to the origin of babies. Although a number of sexual and excretal fantasies and anxieties (such as Oedipal wishes and castration anxiety) are explored during the case history, Freud does not ultimately explain the case in terms of these factors, and on occasion reproaches Herbert's father for sticking too dogmatically to a rigidly Oedipal understanding of his son's anxiety. Freud also regrets the parents' unwillingness to tell Herbert the truth about coition. Freud wrote a summary analysis of \\"Little Hans\\", in 1909, in a paper titled Analysis of a Phobia in a Five-year-old Boy. The information gathered from the father included reports of Herbert's dreams, his behavior, and his answers to the father's questions. Freud believed that what he learned from Herbert's situation backed up his ideas about infantile sexuality as outlined in his Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality in 1905. Herbert's fear was thought to be the result of several factors, including the birth of a little sister, his desire to replace his father as his mother's sexual mate, emotional conflicts over masturbation, and others. The anxiety was seen as stemming from the incomplete repression and other defense mechanisms being used to combat the impulses involved in his sexual development. Herbert's behavior and emotional state improved after he was provided with sexual information by his father, and the two became closer. Herbert's analysis falls into two distinct stages, the first concerning the fear of horses themselves, and the second of the boxes and containers that they transported around Vienna. In the first phase, Herbert is afraid that a white horse will bite him or come into his room, or will collapse and fall over. Freud interprets this as a fear of the father, fear that the father will punish him for his desires over the mother and to act aggressively towards the father. Because Herbert's father was acting as analyst, Freud conjectures that this fear is impeding the progress of the treatment, something which he resolved by inviting Herbert to see him (Freud) personally and explaining this fear to him: Following this, Herbert becomes pre-occupied with excrement, which Freud and Herbert's father help him to associate with the birth of babies. The carts and omnibuses are associated with the boxes which, according to the theory of reproduction that Herbert has been given, storks use to bring new babies. Herbert fears the arrival of more babies as this will further reduce the attention he receives from his mother, and expresses the wish that his baby sister should die. He also expresses the wish to have children of his own (with his mother) with his father elevated to the role of grandfather. Herbert's treatment is taken to be complete when he expresses two new fantasies: one which shows that he has overcome his castration anxiety, and one which consciously acknowledges his desire to be married to his mother. These fantasies coincide with the disappearance of his phobia. - jezalene Freud follows the case history with a 40-page assessment of the case in which he links it to his theory of sexuality. He claims that he has learned nothing from this case that he already had not deduced from his analysis of adults, but he is nonetheless \\"tempted to claim a typical and exemplary importance\\" for the case in view of the direct and immediate proof of his theories that it appears to provide. In 1922, Freud wrote a short postscript to the case study, in which he reported that \\"Little Hans\\" had appeared in his office as a \\"strapping youth of nineteen\\", who \\"was perfectly well and suffered from no troubles or inhibitions\\". Minor revisions and additions to the case material were made in 1923‚Äì1924. The conclusions drawn by Freud were strongly criticized by Joseph Wolpe and Stanley Rachman in the essay \\"A Little Child Shall Lead Them\\" published first as \\"Psychoanalytic Evidence: A Critique Based on Freud's Case of Little Hans.\\" in Critical Essays on Psychoanalysis, edited by Stanley Rachman, Macmillan (1963) which maintains that most of the material provided by Herbert was planted in his mind by Freud and Herbert's father. Career in opera In 1930, in Frankfurt, Herbert Graf directed the world premiere of Arnold Schoenberg's Von heute auf morgen. In 1936, after holding operatic posts in M√ºnster, Breslau (now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland), Frankfurt (where he was director of the Opera School at the Hoch Conservatory, 1930‚Äì1933; when the Nazis came to power he was released from his duties) and Salzburg, the 33-year-old Graf emigrated to the United States, where he became a successful and popular opera producer at New York's Metropolitan Opera (1936‚Äì1960, debuting with Samson and Delilah). He staged new famous productions in the French (The Tales of Hoffmann 1937), Italian (Otello 1937, La forza del destino 1943), then German (Der Ring des Nibelungen 1947, Der Rosenkavalier 1949), repertoires. Graf had a strong sense of tradition and encouraged young operatic talent. In the late 1950s, he returned to Europe, where he produced opera at London's Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, (1958‚Äì1959). After another year in New York, Graf settled in Switzerland, working at the Z√ºrich Opera (1960‚Äì1963), and Geneva's Grand Th√©√¢tre (1965‚Äì1973). Graf staged several operas for the Salzburg Festival: Otello (1951, with Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler conducting, 1952 with Mario Rossi conducting; both times with Ram√≥n Vinay as Otello), The Marriage of Figaro (1952, with Rudolf Moralt conducting, with Erich Kunz, George London, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Irmgard Seefried, Hilde Gueden; 1953 revival conducted by Furtw√§ngler and Paul Sch√∂ffler replacing London), a legendary Don Giovanni conducted by Furtw√§ngler and designed by Clemens Holzmeister (1953, with Cesare Siepi, Elisabeth Gr√ºmmer, Anton Dermota, Schwarzkopf, Otto Edelmann, Walter Berry, Raffaele Ari√©, Erna Berger; revival 1954, with Dezs√∂ Ernster replacing Ari√©; 1956 with Dimitri Mitropoulos conducting), Gottlob Frick replacing Ernster, L√©opold Simoneau replacing Dermota, Lisa Della Casa replacing Schwarzkopf, Fernando Corena replacing Edelmann, Rita Streich replacing Berger) an equally legendary The Magic Flute conducted by Georg Solti and designed by Oskar Kokoschka (1955, cast included Gottlob Frick, Dermota, Sch√∂ffler, Kunz, Gr√ºmmer, Erika K√∂th, Peter Klein; revival in 1956 with Berry replacing Kunz); Elektra (1957, conducted by Mitropoulos, with Inge Borkh, Della Casa, Jean Madeira, Max Lorenz, Kurt B√∂hme), Simon Boccanegra (1961, with Gianandrea Gavazzeni conducting, with Tito Gobbi, Leyla Gencer, Giorgio Tozzi, Rolando Panerai), and finally La rappresentazione di anima e di corpo by Emilio de' Cavalieri (the production premiered in 1968 and was shown each year until 1973). Graf staged Maria Callas in Les v√™pres siciliennes (at the Florence May Festival and La Scala, 1951), Mefistofele (at the Verona Arena, in which Callas alternated with Magda Olivero, 1954), and Poliuto (at La Scala, 1960, also with Franco Corelli and Ettore Bastianini). For the Arena di Verona Festival, Graf directed several productions of Aida (1954, revival in 1955; 1958; and 1966). Publications Among the books written by Herbert Graf were The Opera and Its Future in America (New York, W. W.

Thomas Brown was born in England in 1803. Little is known of his life in England, except that he married Eliza Bussey in 1836, and by 1840 he was living in Cuddesdon, Oxfordshire and working as a road surveyor. He was reasonably well off financially by then, having an interest in the rental of a turnpike, and some rental property in the district. In November 1840, Brown and his family emigrated to Western Australia, arriving on the Sterling in March 1841. On arrival at the Swan River Colony, Brown went immediately to York, where he purchased Grass Dale from Revett Henry Bland. Brown purchased ewes for the property, and began selecting horses for breeding. In July 1841 he accepted a position as assistant government surveyor, but the work took him away from his property too much, and he resigned in January 1842. He became active in the York Agricultural Society, being its president during 1843. In November 1844 he was appointed a Justice of the Peace. Brown worked at Grass Dale until 1852, during which time he had great success in the development of his land and stock, but little success financially. By the end of that period, the property was in debt by over ¬£2000. In 1850, Brown decided to seek better land. Together with his son Kenneth, he joined a party of eight in exploring overland from York to the Champion Bay district. The party travelled 300 miles (480 km) and found large tracts of apparently good land. Brown selected 40,000 acres (160 km¬≤) on the Greenough River, and the following year established a homestead there, which he called Glengarry. Although Brown leased out Grass Dale and established a homestead at Glengarry, his intention of living at Glengarry did not eventuate. Late in 1850, shortly before his intended relocation to Glengarry, Brown was nominated to the Legislative Council, a position which required him to be in Perth. As Brown was committed to moving to Champion Bay, he stated his intention to decline the nomination, but was persuaded by the Governor of Western Australia, Captain Charles Fitzgerald to sit for the remainder of the session. Brown became involved in controversy almost as soon as he took his seat. In the Governor's address to the new Legislative Council, Fitzgerald stated that he considered the new Members, Brown, Marshall Clifton and Lionel Samson, to represent their districts. This statement was then misreported by The Perth Gazette as having been said by the men themselves. As none of the men were elected representatives, this greatly angered the colony's many supporters of responsible government, and the York settlers published a declaration denying that Brown represented them, or indeed that he had any political influence in the district. Shortly afterwards, Brown published a dignified letter stating that he had never considered himself to be a representative of any particular class or district, then resigned his seat. Once again Brown prepared to relocate to Glengarry, but in October 1851 he was appointed acting Police Magistrate in Fremantle, during the absence of Thomas Yule. Brown accepted the position and moved his family to Fremantle, leaving Glengarry in the hands of his eldest son Kenneth. He was appointed Resident Magistrate for Fremantle the following year, and from 1856 was also Perth's Collector of Customs. In October 1862, Brown was transferred to the position of Resident Magistrate at Geraldton. He held the position until his death the following June. Early in June 1863, Brown suffered a series of heart attacks, and he died on 5 June. He was buried two days later in the old Geraldton cemetery. Among Thomas Brown's seven children were Kenneth, Maitland and Matilda, who married Samuel Hamersley. Edith Cowan was his granddaughter.

Like some Chinese-made cars, the JMC Landwind is largely derived from older imported technology and design, in this case the Isuzu Rodeo, which was sold from 1998 to 2004. In China the SUV is sold under the name of Jiangling Baowei and it is also available as a pickup truck called the Jiangling Baodian. The Baodian is exported as the \\"JMC Boarding\\" to Asian, South American, and African markets (amongst others).

The car made headlines after German car club ADAC showed in its crash test, carried out for EuroNCAP, that a driver of this vehicle would not survive a head-on collision at 64 km/h (40 MPH). The Dutch importer of the Landwind called for a test by German safety monitoring agency T√úV to show that the car was in fact safe enough for European standards. These tests are similar to the EuroNCAP tests, but the collision speed is lower at 56 km/h (35 mph). Despite the worst crash results in decades T√úV subsequently confirmed that the Landwind met all mandatory safety criteria according to ECE R94. The controversy did not end there. Opponents say the T√úV test is not enough to guarantee vehicle safety today. They claim that R94 is outdated and only guarantees that the driver will be alive after a crash, and that it does not take into account serious injuries such as severe crushing of the legs. R94 is also performed at a lower speed. Ron Zwaans, general director of Landwind Europe, says his company is working together with ADAC to keep improving the Landwind's safety. He claims his goal is to ultimately pass the more rigorous EuroNCAP testing. Further controversy arose from 2014 onwards, with Landwind's introduction of its follow on Landwind X7 SUV, which was quickly noted to closely visually resemble Jaguar Land Rover's Range Rover Evoque. 2006 Paris Motor Show At the 2006 Paris Motor Show, Landwind displayed an updated version of its SUV, called X-Pedition, as well as an MPV called the Fashion (Landwind CV9) that would compete in the same size class with MPVs such as the Kia Carens.

Palagonite is an alteration product from the interaction of water with volcanic glass of chemical composition similar to basalt. Palagonite can also result from the interaction between water and basalt melt. The water flashes to steam on contact with the hot lava and the small fragments of lava react with the steam to form the light-colored palagonite tuff cones common in areas of basaltic eruptions in contact with water. An example is found in the pyroclastic cones of the Galapagos Islands. Charles Darwin recognized the origin of these cones during his visit to the islands. Palagonite can also be formed by a slower weathering of lava into palagonite, resulting in a thin, yellow-orange rind on the surface of the rock. The process of conversion of lava to palagonite is called palagonitization. Palagonite soil is a light yellow-orange dust, comprising a mixture of particles ranging down to sub-micrometer sizes, usually found mixed with larger fragments of lava. The color is indicative of the presence of iron in the +3 oxidation state, embedded in an amorphous matrix. Palagonite tuff is a tuff composed of sideromelane fragments and coarser pieces of basaltic rock, embedded in a palagonite matrix. A composite of sideromelane aggregate in palagonite matrix is called hyaloclastite. Palagonite on Mars Based on infrared spectroscopy, the fine-grained component of Mauna-Kea palagonite is the terrestrial material with the best match to the spectral properties of Martian dust, and is believed to be similar in composition and in origin to dusty component of the surface regolith of Mars.R.B.

It was written by Michael Steinberg and Tegan West. Its story follows a group of cave-divers and scientists who become trapped while exploring a cave system in Romania, and encounter a pack of deadly creatures. It stars Cole Hauser, Eddie Cibrian, Morris Chestnut, Marcel Iure»ô, Lena Headey, Rick Ravanello, Piper Perabo and Daniel Dae Kim. The film was produced by Lakeshore Entertainment and Cinerenta and was released on August 26, 2005. It grossed $6.1 million during its opening weekend and $33.3 million worldwide, against a budget of $30 million. It received negative reviews and has a 12% approval rating based on 111 votes on Rotten Tomatoes. Plot In the 13th-century Carpathian Mountains of Romania, an Eastern Orthodox abbey and its inhabitants are destroyed by a landslide. Centuries later, a group of modern-day Soviet and British plunderers search for the long-lost abbey during the Cold War era. They discover the abbey is built above a vast cave system, but it is completely blocked off by an intricate floor mosaic. Trying to blast their way in, they cause a landslide that buries the abbey, trapping the men in the cavern below. They descend further into the cave in hopes of finding a way out, even as they hear strange sounds in the darkness. Some time later, present day, a new team, led by Dr. Nicolai, with his associate Dr. Kathryn Jennings and cameraman Alex Kim explore the site, and the mythology behind the winged demons depicted in the mosaic on the abbey's floor. Local biologists believe the cave could contain an undiscovered ecosystem, so they hire a group of American spelunkers led by brothers Jack and Tyler McAllister ‚Äì thrill-seeking professional cave explorers who run a world-famous team of divers. They arrive in Romania with a modified rebreather allowing a diver to remain submerged for up to 24 hours. The diving team includes rock-climbing professional Charlie, first scout Briggs, sonar expert Strode, and survival expert Top Buchanan. Briggs is chosen to scout ahead; when contact is lost, the group presses on in the likelihood it is simply an equipment malfunction. After the group finds Briggs safely downriver, Strode is suddenly attacked and dragged away by a large, unknown creature. His water scooter explodes and causes a cave-in, forcing them to follow the river and search for a new way out. Jennings and Nicolai discover a strange parasite in all of the lifeforms they find. Unlike the known cave species, which have adapted over generations to life underground, Jennings believes this new parasite originated in the cave environment and has never been exposed to the outside world. The team stumble across the equipment and remains of previous explorers, unaware they are being stalked by the creatures. They descend through a series of rapids, where Nicolai is attacked and Jack goes after him. Nicolai is dragged into a crevice but Jack breaks free, injured, after seeing letters tattooed on one of the creatures. Jack‚Äôs senses and physical features begin to transform. When Jack tells them they must go back up to escape, Charlie scales the wall and is attacked by a creature hidden in the passage above. She nearly drops to her death, but recovers, before the human-sized winged creature kills her on the cliff face in full view of the team. As Jack exhibits super-keen senses and inhumanly slanted pupils, Jennings speculates that Jack, the previous explorers, and all the ecosystem's creatures mutated due to the parasite; and the infected humans resemble demons. Witnessing Jack‚Äôs transformation, some of the survivors question his judgement and the team splits up. Alex, Briggs, and Jennings go their own way, while Top and Tyler stay with Jack. Jack, Top, and Tyler discover a cavern littered with human skeletons and realize this is the ancient battleground depicted in the abbey's artwork; the abbey‚Äôs residents sealed the cave to prevent the creatures from escaping. After they see daylight through the underwater passage ahead, Tyler goes back to find the others, but Briggs dies defending Jennings and Alex, while the creatures enter the cavern and steal the rebreathers necessary to navigate the passage. Alex is killed before they can get in the water, but Tyler, Jennings and Top escape while Jack stays behind to hold off the creatures. The three survivors return to civilization, and Top departs. Tyler asks Jennings if Jack could have survived in the open. She responds that she originally thought the parasite could only survive underground, but is now uncertain and thinks that it wants to get out. She bends down to kiss his cheek, revealing her pupils are like Jack's. As Katheryn walks away, Tyler realizes she knows she is infected with the parasite and intends to remain free, able to infect others. He runs after her, but she disappears in the crowd.

Reception The Cave received mostly negative reviews. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 12% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 111 reviews, with an average rating of 3.5/10. The critics consensus reads, \\"Despite its stylized and impressive sets, this horror-monster movie mish-mash suffers from endless cliches and wildly implausible plotlines.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 30 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". The main complaint was the lack of character building and overly familiar cliches, with Neil Smith of BBC Online calling it \\"a generic duffer that is as exciting as a hole in the ground\\". Robert Koehler made the same observation in Variety, writing, \\"The Cave feels familiar as it goes through the rote edicts of the scientific crew vs. beastie formula\\". In her review for the New York Times, Laura Kern praised the films sets and visual style, but denounced the script, writing \\"Having worked as second- and third-unit director on the Matrix trilogy and Dark City, Bruce Hunt is no stranger to inspired and stylish productions. But whereas those films managed to inject new life into tired territory, The Cave, his first effort as director, fails to generate anything resembling innovation. The film has been criticized due to its weak plot and simple characters, but it is eerily effective and seems like a stereotypical \\"audience loved, critic hated\\" arthouse horror. Judy Chia Hui Hsu wrote in The Seattle Times, \\"the serenity of the largely aquatic underground world framed by majestic stalagmites and serpentine corridors succeeds in capturing the moviegoer‚Äôs attention,\\" but added, \\"The insipid dialog lacks even a hint of comic relief, so the audience is grateful when the action quickly kicks into gear,\\" and \\"one of the film‚Äôs biggest letdowns is that the vicious beast, seen in the full light of the final scenes, is not such a surprise after all. The creature is simply an amalgamation of monsters we‚Äôve seen before\\". Box office In the US, the film opened ranked #5 grossing a poor $6,147,294 at 2,195 sites, averaging $2,800. It went on to have a final US gross of $15,007,991. In Australia, it opened at 89 sites, averaging A$3,204 grossing A$285,121. It had a massive 2nd weekend decrease by 74%, and had a finishing gross of A$570,131. Worldwide, the film has grossed $33,296,457. As of 2020, the movie has yet to be released on Blu-ray. Soundtrack Two soundtrack CDs were released on August 26, 2005 by Lakeshore Records, one with the score by the film's composers Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek and the other one which features tracks by heavy metal bands including Atreyu, Lacuna Coil, Diecast, Burning Brides, Ill Ni√±o, Killswitch Engage, Shadows Fall, It Dies Today, Trivium and more. Also, the single Nemo by Nightwish is featured during the end credits of the film.

In addition to his or her role overseeing the librarians in the Royal Library, the Librarian is also Deputy Keeper of the Royal Archives and is responsible for the management of the Royal Archives and its collections.Allison, R, and Riddell, S (eds.), The Royal Encyclopaedia. Macmillan Press, 1991 The role of the Royal Librarian Today the Royal Library collections comprise the documentary and intellectual heritage of the Monarchy of the United Kingdom and its predecessors, span nearly two-and-half millennia and comprise millions of pages, many unique, many encapsulating some of the most extraordinary moments in British history, and many items important in their own right. As well as books and manuscripts, The Librarian is also responsible for the collections of insignia, coins and medals, seals, banknotes, and other material. As Assistant Keeper of the Royal Archives, The Librarian has oversight of the Royal Archives, based at Windsor Castle since 1911. The Royal Library and Royal Archives supports the work of the Royal Household in the Royal Collection Trust Department through exhibitions, events, and publications, and the work of the Lord Chamberlain's and Private Secretary's Offices through the creation of displays and manufacture of gifts for State Visits, for selected garden parties, and other types of official and public engagement. The Royal Library and Royal Archives teams work very closely with the information assurance work of Royal Household to meet the challenges of dealing with library and archive material in the digital age. The Royal Library includes responsibility for the Royal Library bindery. History Although a Librarian was always required for any sizeable royal collection of books, the present office dates from 1836, when the then existing collections of books at Windsor Castle were consolidated. This followed two donations of the bulk of the historic collections to the British Museum (now held in the split-off British Library). The so-called Old Royal Library was given under George II in 1757, and included the relatively small, but high quality, holdings of medieval manuscripts, many acquired or re-acquired long after their creation, and a collection essentially beginning with Edward IV that had been retained since new in the royal library. The King's Library was some 65,000 volumes essentially assembled by George III and given by George IV. The offer was made in 1823, but the physical transfer delayed until 1827, when a new gallery had been built. The office was only admitted to the Royal Household in the 19th century. John Glover was appointed in 1837 and since his time there have been 8 subsequent Librarians. They are: * John Glover 1837-1860 * Bernard Woodward 1860-1869 * Richard (later Sir Richard) Holmes 1870-1905 * The Hon.

Sir Christopher Geidt). From 2002-2013 the then Librarian, The Hon. Lady Jane Roberts's responsibilities included the Library and prints and drawings only, with the Assistant Keepership of the Royal Archives coming under the responsibility of Director of Records (currently David Ryan LVO first as Assistant Keeper and now as Deputy Keeper of the Royal Archives). Since 2014, The Librarian has once again responsibility as Assistant Keeper of the Royal Archives, while the prints and drawings collections held in the Print Room became the responsibility of a newly created post of Head of Prints and Drawings (currently Martin Clayton MVO).

He arrived in Macau on 15 September 1931, where, at the age of 14, he entered the St Joseph Diocesan Seminary, where he studied theory, solfeggio and harmony with the fathers Wilhelm Schmid and Antonio Andre Ngan. He was ordained a priest on 8 September 1943. Fr. Aureo was professor at the seminary and also a chaplain and vicar of the Macau Cathedral. He was later appointed St Lawrence parish priest and became director of the Catholic weekly newspaper O Clarim. Other posts held by Fr. Aureo included professor of choral singing and professor of \\\\religion and morals at the Liceu and the Pedro Nolasco Commercial School. In 1951, Fr. Aureo went to Lisbon to study music at the National Conservatory, where he also studied voice and piano with Biermann, Arminda Correia and Croner de Vasconcelos (1910‚Äì1974). He was also assistant to the Portuguese conductor and musicologist Mario Sampayo Ribeiro (1898‚Äì1966) in the choir of the University of Lisbon. He graduated with a distinction in Music Composition in 1958. While he lived in Portugal, he completed the \\"Sonata No 1, Tres Conrais Melodias Gregorianas\\", \\"Sonata No 2, Sonatina no1\\" and \\"Sonatina no2. His Te Deum\\" for choir and organ. They premiered at the church of Sao Joao de Deus, Lisbon. Returning to Macau, he promoted religious singing and founded the \\"Grupo Coral Polifonico\\" in 1959. In 1962, along with Father Cesar Brianza, he founded the \\"Academia de Musica de S. Pio X\\" of which he became Director. \\"Dancas da Siu Mui Mui\\", a piano suite for children, was composed in 1967-68 and published in Hong Kong in 1971. Besides academic studies, the Academia de Musica de S Pio X organized public concerts, free of charge, and invited many internationally famous musicians to give concerts in Macau. In 1983, he founded the Macau Chamber Orchestra with British composer Stuart Bonner and a group of friends. The members of the orchestra were amateur musicians and music teachers from the Academy, which was later incorporated to the Macau Cultural Institute. Fr. Aureo dedicated his life to the promotion of music and his talents as teacher and composer are widely recognized. Today, students from the Academia can be found in Portugal, France, Switzerland, Australia, USA and Canada. In 1987 and 1990, he was twice decorated by the Macau Government with the Medal of Cultural Merit. Fr. Aureo died on 21 January 1993, aged 76, at the Complexo Hospitalar Conde de S. Januario, and was buried at the Cemetery of Sao Miguel Arcanjo.

The environment also has a strong influence on the morphology of an individual plant. Description Persicaria lapathifolia is an annual herb with erect reddish stems with swollen joints, growing to a height of . The leaves are alternate with short stalks, often densely hairy underneath. The leaf blades often have a dark-coloured blotch in the centre and are lanceolate or narrowly elliptical and have entire margins. Each leaf base has stipules which are fused into a stem-enclosing sheath that is loose and fringed with few if any hairs at the upper end. The inflorescence is a dense spike, often nodding. The perianth of each tiny pink flower consists of four or five lobes, fused near the base. There are six stamens, two partially fused carpels and two styles. The fruit is a rounded, flattened nut.

Dipper made his first-class debut in 1908 when called into the Gloucestershire side which was a man short for the match against Kent at Tonbridge. He batted at number nine and top scored, but failed to keep a regular place in the team. He re-emerged as an opening batsman in 1911 and was then a regular in the team until 1932, when he retired. A defensive batsman in what was, until the arrival of Wally Hammond in the mid-1920s, usually a weak batting line-up, Dipper exceeded 1,000 runs in a season 15 times and went on to 2,000 five times. His full aggregate of 28,075 runs puts him 73rd on the all-time list of run-getters and he made 53 centuries. Dipper played in just one Test match for England, against Australia at Lord's in 1921, the year when many new players were tried against the all- conquering team led by Warwick Armstrong. Dipper scored 40 and 11, but was dropped. His lack of mobility as a fielder probably cost him further consideration. In retirement, Dipper stood as a first-class umpire. He was also a high standard player of bowls and billiards.

Career Michael Robbins was born in Croydon in Greater London to Percival W. Robbins (1899‚Äì1956) and Bertha May n√©e Sindall (1900‚Äì1997) who outlived him. From 1939 to 1944 Robbins was a pupil at St Michael's College, a Catholic school for boys, in Hitchin, Hertfordshire. He then went on to work as a bank clerk and later became an actor after appearing in amateur dramatic performances also in Hitchin, where he and his family lived at the time. He took part in the 1951 Hitchin Pageant dressed as a gladiator. Robbins made his television debut as the cockney soldier in Roll-on Bloomin' Death. Primarily a comedy actor, he is best remembered for the role of Arthur Rudge, the persistently sarcastic husband of Olive (Anna Karen), in the popular sitcom On the Buses (1969‚Äì73). Robbins and Karen provided the secondary comic storyline to Reg Varney's comedy capers at the bus depot. Robbins also appeared in the series film spin-offs, On the Buses, Mutiny on the Buses, and Holiday on the Buses. His other comedy credits include non-recurring roles in Man About the House, Oh Brother!, The Good Life, One Foot in the Grave, The New Statesman, George and Mildred, Hi-de-Hi! and You Rang, M'Lord?. He appeared as a rather humorously portrayed police sergeant in the TV adaptation of Brendon Chase. As well as these comic roles, he assumed various straight roles in some of the major British television shows of the 1960s and 1970s: including the role of the hard-drinking old sea dog Harry Baxter in The Saint episode The People Importers. He also made appearances in Minder, The Sweeney, Z-Cars, Return of the Saint, Murder Most English, Rumpole Of The Bailey,The Avengers, Dixon of Dock Green, The Bill and the 1982 Doctor Who story \\"The Visitation\\".

He was active in the Grand Order of Water Rats (being elected 'Rat of the Year' in 1978) and the Catholic Stage Guild, and received the Pro Ecclesia et Pontiface Medal, a papal award from the Pope, for his services in 1987. In one of his last television appearances, in A Little Bit of Heaven Robbins recalled his childhood visits to Norfolk and spoke of his faith and love of the Shrine of Our Lady at Walsingham. In the mid-1970s he also directed a film, How Are You?. He also appeared as a councillor in EastEnders in June 1989. Personal life Robbins was married to actress Hal Dyer (1935-2011), from 1960 until his death from prostate cancer in 1992 aged 62. Dyer died in 2011 from a brain hemorrhage.

He is best known for his Sefer ha- Mizrachi, a supercommentary on Rashi's commentary on the Torah. He is also known as Re'em (), the Hebrew acronym for \\"Rabbi Elijah Mizrachi\\", coinciding with the Biblical name of an animal, sometimes translated as \\"unicorn\\". Biography Mizrachi was born in Constantinople; he was of Romaniote origin, meaning that his family was from Ottoman Greece, and not from the Spanish exile. He studied under Elijah ha-Levi and Judah Minz of Padua. As a young man, he distinguished himself as a Talmudist, yet he also studied the secular sciences, particularly mathematics and astronomy; he is said to have been the first to derive a method for the extraction of the cube root. He also knew Greek and Arabic. Mizrachi succeeded Moses Capsali (on his death c. 1495) as Hakham Bashi (\\"Grand Rabbi\\") of the Ottoman empire; he held this position for the rest of his life. As Hakham Bashi he was known for his mild attitude toward the Karaites, an attitude inherited from his teacher Elijah ha-Levi; he even held that it was permissible to teach them Talmud. Works Sefer ha- Mizrachi is a supercommentary on Rashi's commentary on the Torah. It is counted in its own right as among the most important commentaries on the Torah. It was first published in Venice in 1527 after Mizrachi's death, by his son Israel. Mizrachi himself considered his commentary on Rashi the most important of his works (Responsa, Nos. 5, 78). The work shows Rashi's Talmudic and midrashic sources, and elucidates all obscure passages. It was written, partially, to defend Rashi from the strictures of the later commentators, particularly Nachmanides. A compendium by Jacob Marcaria was published under the title Kitzur Mizrachi (Trento, 1561), and later, one by Isaac ha-Kohen of Ostroh, entitled Mattenat 'Ani (Prague, 1604-9). Several commentaries have been written on Mizrachi, including Yeri'ot Shlomo by Solomon Luria (Maharshal), a supercommentary on Sefer ha-Mizrachi by Barzillai ben Baruch Jabez, and strictures on the work by Samuel Edels, (Maharsha). Other works of Torah by Mizrachi include: *Tosefet Semag, novellae on Sefer Mitzvot Gadol (\\"Semag\\") of Rabbi Moses ben Jacob of Coucy. * A collection of responsa - Teshuvot Re'em; see History of Responsa: Fifteenth century. Mizrachi also authored works on mathematics and science: * Sefer ha-Mispar on arithmetic, and a commentary to Ptolemy's Almagest, an important text on astronomy. (Melekhet ha-Mispar; is a similar work attributed to Mizrachi, which additionally contains a chapter on chess). * A commentary on Euclid's Elements, a fundamental mathematics text.

Producing their own material, the band was heavily influenced by Metallica. Later, the grunge genre was making waves in Malaysia and Loque's Tail decided to have a change in their musical direction from metal to grunge and punk. During a school break in 1993, Loque frequently visits a jamming studio named the Black Widow Studios in Petaling Jaya. During one of his visits he bumped into Emmett, who was there jamming with his own band at the time, Grunge Dayz. Impressed with Emmett's cover of \\"Under the Bridge\\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers, Loque then show his skills on \\"I Could Have Lied\\" to Emmett. Loque approached him to form a new band, which they finally settled on Butterfingers for the band's name. Not long after, Butterfingers was a hit in the local underground scene, playing in packed gigs. Butterfingers produced their first pair of demos in 1994, \\"Girl Friday\\"(Butterfingers first song) and When You're Addicted (later renamed to \\"Nicc o'Tynne\\"), which were first performed at the Cobra Club House, circa late 1994 and early 1995. With the positive feedback and confidence received from the gig, they decided to record more songs. 12 goats, 6 oranges and 2 angles was their first demo, which came from a live session at FM Studio on 10 January 1995. The demo displayed the raw energy they were known for, and heavily influenced by grunge with Emmett's vocals being presented in the same fashion as Kurt Cobain's. Many of the locals had the impression that their demo was an unreleased Nirvana album. Later on, Butterfingers became a staple name in underground scene, along with other bands such as OAG, The Splatters and Spiral Kinetic Circus. They then released further demo tapes such as Butter Couldn't Melt, and Dragon. =Rise To Fame (1996‚Äì1999)= Butterfingers then released their debut album, 1.2 Miligrams (1996) after signing with EMI Malaysia. The album is quoted to have been \\"...laced with Nirvana-esque tunes, much like Mudhoney's early albums...\\". The album went on to achieve the local Gold status for sales of over 15,000 units. They went on to release their second album Butter Worth Pushful (1997) with a much more matured sound which debuted at number six on the Malaysian International RIM Charts, a first ever for a local band. The album continued to propel Butterfingers to a higher level of local fame, earning them their second consecutive Gold status (with an estimated total of over 18000 units sold), and it also gave them their first AIM (Anugerah Industri Muzik or Music Industry Award) nominations for 'Best Engineered Album' and 'Best English Album'. In March 1999, Transcendence (1999) debuted at the number three on the RIM International Charts was released and sold over 60,000 units, which was considered to be Butterfinger's best work. The album went on to earn Butterfingers their first Double Platinum Award. This album also contains their most well-known song, \\"The Chemistry (Between Us)\\". =2000‚Äì2009= 2001, from left ‚Äì Numlock, Kadak, Loque, Emmett & Loko After the success of Transcendence and the release of Butter Late Than Never (2000), a collection of old live tracks and outtakes with some previously unreleased songs from earlier demos, Butterfingers released Malayneum (2001) to critical acclaim, despite the mixed reaction from fans who still wanted a more 'grunge-y' sound the band was known for. After the release of a greatest hits album The Best is Yet to Come (2003), the band started working on their next album which would eventually become their first album that was sung in the Malay Language, entitled Selamat Tinggal Dunia (2005). In 2003, Emmett had left to pursue his studies in Canada, leaving the rest of the band to release and promote Selamat Tinggal Dunia without him. Loque later left for Berklee College of Music in Boston in 2006. Butterfingers ended their hiatus with another Malay album which would also be their last album together, Kembali (2008). The album was well received by fans and critics alike. On 29 March 2009, they performed their farewell show at the Sunburst Music Festival. Butterfingers performed with Greg Henderson (who had replaced Loque, who was back in Boston). Butterfingers full line-up farewell show at Istana Budaya, Kuala Lumpur =2019-present= After returning from Boston, Loque started a new project called monoloQue. Recently, Emmett has returned to Malaysia and performed at the Petronas Technology University on July 31, 2015. Loque was reported to have said that he has no interest reforming Butterfingers in a recent interview: \\"To me there's no point in repeating myself. I'm not trying to be Metallica here, or Wings, or Search. To gather old fans and play the old songs. I don't really mind it. I need to progress. As a composer, as an artist I really need to try new things. There's always a stigma with Butterfingers. I've accepted it. That's why I don't do 'Butterfingers X' or 'Real Butterfingers'. monoloQue is a different entity entirely. Even though my element will always be 'Butters'. The sound is me, I'm 'Butters'. No matter how you take me out of the equation. Apart from the songs and the sound, it's me, Emmett, Kadak and Loko. So when you say Butterfingers, it has to be all of us because people want to hear Emmett, they want to hear Kadak's sound, and Loko. Up until Malayneum (2001) the Butterfingers thing was going smoothly; up to Selamat Tinggal Dunia (2005), it had already gone into a writer's block phase for me. And I don't know how I came up with those songs. That's what makes the album special to me. 'Butters' will always be inside me, I started it all and it's my baby. So when fans cannot accept things as they have gone now, I just feel they need to move on as well. They cannot be selfish to ask me to play Butterfingers again. It's not because I don't want to because of monoloQue, I did monoloQue because I already made an oath to myself ‚Äì I'd rather sell 10 records loving what I'm playing than selling 100,000 copies and waiting before, with limitations and obligations towards other people. I don't think I'll be doing scoring if I had stuck with Butterfingers, all the opportunities I can tell you came from my ideas with monoloQue. Thankfully, I'm happier now and can put food on the table with monoloQue.\\" Musical style Butterfingers music is often characterised under the genre of Grunge. As time went on, they have evolved with a more matured sound, progressing with multiple influence variations including alternative rock, post-grunge, classic rock, psychedelic rock, progressive rock and traditional/folk. During their English language era, the band's primary lyricist was Emmett, while Loque was the primary songwriter throughout the band's conception. Often attributed for their live performances, the band rarely perform in large venues such as arenas and amphitheaters. Instead, they regularly plays smaller venues. Loque once said in an interview, \\"We're definitely a live band. That's what it's all about for us.

The motto appears at the bottom of the crest of the School. S. Thomas‚Äô College was founded by the first Bishop of Colombo, the Rt. Rev. James Chapman, D. D. It was his foremost vision to build a college and cathedral for the new Diocese of Colombo of the Church of Ceylon. Chapman's objective was to train a Christian clergy and to make children good citizens under the discipline and supervision of Christianity.Reminiscences of a teacher Hundred and twenty fifth anniversary : St. James Church, Mutwal Romancing GurutalawaThe Cathedral of the Diocese of Colombo Cherishing Thomian spirit History of STC An old boy of Eton College, Bishop Chapman founded the college based on the traditional Etonian model. The words are traced back to the Venetian theologian and mathematician Paolo Sarpi (1552‚Äì1623), also known as Fra Paolo. The day before his death he had dictated three replies to questions on affairs of state, and his last words were \\"Esto perpetua\\" reportedly in reference to his beloved Republic (of Venice), and translated as \\"Mayest thou endure forever!\\" These words were also repeated by Henry Grattan upon the achievement of Irish legislative independence in 1782. When the designer of the state seal Emma Edwards Green described the motto on the seal, she translated it as \\"It is perpetuated\\" or \\"It is forever\\". The phrase was used by Jefferson Davis at the close of his book Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government in a wish that it may be ‚ÄúWritten on the arch of the Union.‚Äù Of his attempt to break up the Union, he said ‚ÄúI recognise the fact that the war showed it to be impractical‚Äù.

He was the second Indian director of the Zoological Survey of India, succeeding Baini Prashad. Life Hora was born at Hafizabad in the Punjab (modern day Pakistan) on 2 May 1896. He schooled in Jullunder before college at Lahore. He met Thomas Nelson Annandale who visited his college in Lahore in 1919 and was invited to the Zoological Survey of India. In 1921 he became in-charge of ichthyology and herpetology and in 1947 became Superintendent of the Z.S.I. and then Director after Baini Prashad moved to become an advisor to the government. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1929. His proposers were James Hartley Ashworth, John Stephenson, Charles Henry O'Donoghue and James Ritchie. He died on 8 December 1955. Works The Satpura hypothesis, a zoo-geographical hypothesis proposed by him that suggests that the central Indian Satpura Range of hills acted as a bridge for the gradual migrations of Malayan fauna into the peninsula and the Western Ghats of India. He supported the theory on the basis of torrential fishes which had special suckers to hold onto rocks. Later research however pointed out that his examples made use of unrelated species showing common characters that were independently evolved, that is they were examples of convergent evolution. Hora was also among the Indian pioneers of fish and wildlife conservation and pointed out the effect of dams on the migrations of riverine fishes and noted the poor design of fish ladders in Indian dams. A genus of ricefish, Horaichthys (\\"Hora's Fish\\"), was created in his honour and placed as a sole member of the family Horaichthyidae. The species is now placed in the genus Oryzias and the family is no longer considered valid. Notes References * Hora, S. L. 1944.

Their most recent album Our Raw Heart was released in June 2018. History =Beginnings (1996‚Äì2006)= Before founding YOB, Scheidt had been a bass guitarist with the hardcore bands Chemikill, Dirty Sanchez, and H.C. Minds. Scheidt switched to guitar and vocals and founded YOB in 1996 with bassist Lowell Iles and drummer Greg Ocon. The band's self-titled demo was submitted to Stonerrock.com in 1999. In 2001, YOB recorded its first full-length record for 12th Records in Spokane, Washington, entitled Elaborations of Carbon. By this time, Isamu Sato (of the bands H.C. Minds and Thrombus) had joined on bass and drummer Gabe Morley (of the bands Fingertrap and Lightweight) had joined on drums. In 2002, YOB secured a recording contract with Abstract Sounds. Their first album for this label, Catharsis, had stronger production and three songs lasting 50 minutes. After its release, drummer Morley was replaced by Travis Foster. YOB's third full-length release, The Illusion of Motion, was released on Metal Blade Records in 2004, and their fourth album The Unreal Never Lived was released by Metal Blade in 2005. Scheidt announced in a press release on January 10, 2006, that YOB was disbanding after almost ten years. Foster and Sato had departed six months previously and then Scheidt decided to end the band. At the same time, he also announced that he had been working with a new band called Middian. =Reformation and recent activities (2008‚Äìpresent)= In 2008, Scheidt and Foster reformed YOB with the intention of performing a few live shows and releasing a new album. Bassist Aaron Rieseberg joined the band in 2009, having previously played in the band Norska with his older brother Dustin. The Great Cessation was released by Profound Lore Records in 2009. The band also appeared in Europe at the 2010 Roadburn Festival in the Netherlands. YOB has since toured the United States extensively, alongside bands including Graves at Sea, Lamont, Tummler, Dove, Orange Goblin, Origin, Exhumed, The Locust, The Acc√ºsed, Botch, Isis, Soilent Green, Uphill Battle, Playing Enemy, Will Haven, Dark Castle, Tool, and Ghostride. The album Atma was released in 2011. In February 2014, YOB signed with Neurosis's record label Neurot Recordings. The album Clearing the Path to Ascend was released in September 2014 and attracted widespread acclaim, particularly from Rolling Stone. In early 2017, Scheidt suffered a serious health scare, which inspired the next YOB album. Our Raw Heart was released by Relapse Records in June 2018. Musical style and influences Scheidt cites a varied range of artists as inspiration for Yob's sound, including Neurosis, Tool, Immolation, Saint Vitus, Cathedral, Soundgarden, Deep Purple, The Obsessed, Candlemass, Judas Priest, Pentagram, Trouble, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, King Crimson, and Pink Floyd.

The iconic NAD 3020 integrated amplifier A/V-components, 2009 (at High End fair, Munich) NAD Electronics is a brand name of an electronics firm whose products include home hi-fi amplifiers and related components. NAD is an abbreviation for New Acoustic Dimension. The company was founded in London, England, in 1972 by Dr. Martin L.

NAD was one of the first audio manufacturers to outsource the manufacturing of its products to electronics factories in east Asia. NAD was acquired by the Danish firm AudioNord in 1991 and subsequently sold in 1999 to the Lenbrook Group of Pickering, Ontario, Canada.\\"Lenbrook Group adds NAD to Roster\\", Stereophile, 25 April 1999  Power-supply design  NAD focuses on the concept of \\"effective power\\" and its amplifiers make claims to deliver generous headroom, meaning that they may be able to deliver dynamic power bursts far in excess of their rated RMS powerFord, Jez \\"A history of NAD\\", Sound+Image magazine, Aug/Sep 2017. The key to this feature requires use of a flexible power supply which stores significant reserve current for quick release at moments of high musical load. The various incarnations of this design have been associated with different names over the years including Power Envelope and recently PowerDrive. Additional benefits of this approach include the fact that amplifiers using this technology can handle complex, real-life, lower- impedance loudspeaker loads as compared with the simple 8-ohm resistor typically used to calculate advertised power ratings and the fact that the circuitry in this approach requires less cooling, while maintaining ability to handle complex impedance loads as low as 2 ohms.

Twining (1869‚Äì1924). Twining was laid down on 20 November 1942 at San Francisco, California, by the Bethlehem Steel Co.; launched on 11 July 1943, sponsored by Mrs. S.B.D. Wood; and commissioned on 1 December 1943, Commander Ellis Kerr Wakefield in command. Twining departed San Francisco on 21 December for shakedown training and completed the cruise at San Diego on Christmas Day. Following exercises out of that port, she returned to San Francisco; loaded passengers and cargo; and got underway on 11 February 1944.  1944  Twining arrived at Pearl Harbor on the 17th to begin three months of training exercises, maneuvers, and drills, as her crew honed its skills in bombardment, fire support, and amphibious landing operations in preparation for Operation Forager. On 31 May, the destroyer departed the Hawaiian Islands in company with Fire Support Group 1 of the Saipan invasion forces. She arrived at Kwajalein on 8 June, fueled, and commenced antisubmarine patrols off the harbor entrance. On the 10th, Twining screened the sortie of the task group from the lagoon; headed for the Marianas; and arrived off Saipan at dawn on the 14th. Steaming off the island's eastern shore, she screened cruiser ; joined briefly in the pre- assault bombardment and, late in the afternoon, engaged in a running battle with a coastal battery. Leading and Montpelier, Twining closed the shore to 3,000 yards and joined in the fire which silenced the enemy guns. As darkness fell, she took up her station to screen vessels supplying night harassment fire at Garapan on Saipan's west coast. The next day, D-Day, she continued screening duties and fired on selected shore targets while marines landed on the western side of the island. Japanese planes appeared at dusk, but none came within range of Twining's guns. She spent most of the 16th in the unproductive pursuit of a sound contact and, at dusk, joined in the bombardment of Magicienne Bay. During the night, her guns scored hits on a Japanese ammunition dump near Aslito airfield. Early on the morning of 17 June, Twining joined Destroyer Division 106 and steamed to rendezvous with Vice Admiral Willis A. Lee's battleships in anticipation of fleet action. The American assault on the Marianas had drawn the Japanese Combined Fleet northward for an attempt to repulse the thrust. The 18th passed uneventfully except for sightings of a few snoopers. Then, at dawn the next day, a lone, unidentified plane closed the formation; took fire from Twining and others; circled; and disappeared. The ensuing lull lasted until 10:08 when reported a large number of aircraft approaching from the west. Steaming on picket station 10 miles (18 km) west of the formation, Twining caught sight of the first wave of attackers at 10:49. Throughout the battle, combat air patrol (CAP) planes disrupted the enemy onslaught, shooting down many Japanese aircraft and thwarting the approach of the rest. In her first antiaircraft action, Twining splashed two of the planes which got through and also was credited with an assist. During the attacks, the destroyer was the target of two bomb drops but suffered no damages. For Twining, the Battle of the Philippine Sea was over in 26 minutes. No further Japanese planes attacked nearby during the day, although pilots from the American aircraft carriers continued to pick off intruders. On the 20th, Twining steamed west in search of the enemy fleet. Late in the day, the carriers launched an air strike; and, when darkness came, many planes had not returned. Twining turned on her searchlight as a marker for the aircraft and rescued survivors of planes which had gone down in the darkness. At dark on the 21st, the task force abandoned the pursuit of the elusive Japanese fleet and reversed course, steaming eastward to look again for survivors of the air strike force caught by darkness of the day before. On the 23d, Twining fueled at sea; then set course for the Marianas, screening oiler . At Saipan again on the 25th, Twining conducted shore bombardment off Mutcho Point. Throughout the remainder of June, she continued to operate off Saipan, providing shore bombardment, night harassment and illumination fire, as well as screening transports and engaging enemy aircraft. In Magicienne Bay early on the evening of the 28th, Twining, witnessed an impressive exchange of fire between marine units on the south side of the bay and Japanese on the north. Later in the evening, Japanese planes attacked, peppering seaward waters with bombs. Observers on board the destroyer watched as shore fire scored a hit on an enemy plane overhead; then saw the plane fall in flames some four miles away. Just before midnight on 30 June, as Twining patrolled off Nafutan Point, two enemy planes attempted to make runs on Aslito airfield but were turned back by heavy fire from the destroyer. Into July, Twining continued her duties off Saipan, supplying screening, fighter direction, and fire support. She also made occasional voyages to Tinian for bombardment missions. Off the northern tip of Saipan on the night of 6 and 7 July, Twining's crew was kept busy firing on numerous Japanese airplanes which had apparently chosen the ship both as a reference point for their approach to the runway on Marpi Point and as a target for their bombs. Nine planes made approaches during this raid, although only one dropped a bomb. Flares from the planes often illuminated the scene as the destroyer's gunfire drove off all nine, none of which managed to land on the Japanese-held airstrip. In the days that followed, Twining remained on picket station, occasionally firing on enemy troop concentrations on the island. On 24 July, she screened Montpelier and as they shelled Japanese positions on Tinian. The following day, the destroyer fired support missions to screen American troops advancing up the western shore of the island. Twining continued her support of the invasion of Tinian through the end of the month, steaming on station between Tinian and Saipan and occasionally firing at Japanese targets on the island. On 1 August, Twining moved to a new fire support assignment off the southeast coast of Tinian. She made the first of three bombardment runs at 01:30 and later stood in to 1,500 yards from shore to pound enemy-held slopes and caves with gunfire. On the 7th, Twining departed Saipan, escorting slow-moving LST-130 to Eniwetok. A week later, she entered the atoll where her worn strut bearings were replaced. Twining departed Eniwetok on 15 September to rendezvous with Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan's Fast Carrier Task Group (TG 38.2) and thereafter devoted most of her effort for the rest of the war to protecting aircraft carriers. Arriving off Luzon on the 21st, Twining guarded the carriers as they launched strikes despite cloudy weather, squalls, and low visibility. Following the launching of further strikes from an attack position off San Bernardino Strait on the 24th, the task group headed eastward and arrived off Saipan on the 28th. From there, the destroyer conducted antisubmarine patrols until the 30th when the task group got underway for the western Carolines and entered Ulithi lagoon on 6 October. At dusk on the 11th, the task force sortied to get into a position for a strike on Formosa, the first in a series of raids intended to destroy the usefulness of that highly fortified island as an air base and a staging area for Japanese forces during the impending landings on Leyte. For three days, planes from the carriers hit targets on Formosa; and, each evening, Japanese raiders attacked the American ships. On the 12th, Twining rescued several downed fliers. That evening, enemy planes attacked her formation in an action which continued until midnight. A Japanese plane threatened the destroyer from an altitude of 300 feet. After Twining opened fire, the raider attempted to crash into her but rapidly lost altitude and splashed 300 yards off her port bow, spreading flaming gasoline over water near the ship. In the days that followed, enemy air activity continued to be heavy. On the 14th, an enemy bomber dropped two bombs which narrowly missed the destroyer. On the 18th and 21st, the carriers of TG 38.2 launched strikes against targets in the Philippines to support American landings on Leyte. Before dawn on the 24th, reports of American plane sightings of the Japanese Fleet began to reach the destroyer. That day, as Twining continued her routine screening duties, planes from the carriers struck telling blows against Admiral Takeo Kurita's \\"Center Force\\" in the Sibuyan Sea. That night, her task force turned north to attack a Japanese carrier force which had been sighted north of Luzon. Daylong strikes launched from the American flattops sank four enemy carriers of Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa's Northern Force in an action known as the Battle off Cape Enga√±o. On the 26th, planes from TG 38.2 attacked crippled Japanese ships in the Visayan Sea. On the 29th, Twining rescued a downed flier from . But for occasional runs to Ulithi for ammunition, Twining remained with the carriers throughout November as they hammered Japanese fortifications in the Philippines. On 10 December, the destroyer got underway with Rear Admiral Montgomery's Fast Carrier Task Group to act as picket during strikes on Luzon in support of the landings on Mindoro. On the 14th, she rescued a pilot from and had him on board four and one-half minutes after his plane hit the water. On the 17th, in rapidly worsening weather conditions, the formation rendezvoused with fueling units; and Twining filled her oil tanks. During a typhoon which battered the task force the next day, the weight of her full load of fuel gave Twining the added stability she needed to weather 65-foot seas and 50-degree rolls. Ordered to stand by the disabled as the light carrier burned, dead in the water, Twining maintained a position near the stricken vessel throughout the storm. Twining came through the tempest with no major damage but lost one man overboard. As dawn broke in moderating weather on 19 December, the destroyer accompanied the task force as it steamed on for a strike on Luzon; but, when bad weather aborted the strike, she returned to the scene of the typhoon to search for survivors from the three destroyers which had sunk during the storm, before returning to Ulithi on Christmas Eve to repair storm damage.  1945  Admiral William Halsey's 3rd Fleet departed on 30 December and set course for strikes on Formosa, the Ryukyus, and the China coast to prevent Japanese interference with the coming landings on Luzon at Lingayen Gulf. Twining screened the carriers as they launched strikes against the enemy in the Philippines, on Formosa, and in French Indochina. Twining returned to Ulithi on 26 January for dry-docking, provisioning, and training exercises. She got underway again on 10 February with Rear Admiral Davison's Carrier Task Group bound for waters near the Japanese home islands. After naval aircraft raided military targets in the Tokyo area on the 16th and 17th, the task group headed south toward the Volcano Islands. Twining was on picket station off Iwo Jima on 19 February, D-Day, as the carrier force launched strikes and fighter cover for the landings on Iwo Jima. Four days later, the destroyer again headed north protecting carriers steaming toward the Japanese homeland, but bad weather foiled the carriers. On 1 March, the task group launched strikes on the Ryukyus before steaming to the Carolines. In mid-March, Task Force 58 departed Ulithi to conduct strikes on the airfields near Ky≈´sh≈´ on the 18th. The next day, as the group was en route to Kobe, carrier suffered extensive damage when hit by two bombs. Twining helped to protect the damaged vessel as she withdrew. On the 20th, a Japanese plane attempted to finish off the battered carrier only to be chased off by a hail of fire from the escorting ships. On the 22d, having safely conducted Franklin out of danger, Twining set her course for Nansei Shoto. On 27 March, Twining screened destroyer ‚Äîwhich had taken an aerial torpedo through her bow above the water‚Äîuntil that ship had completed temporary repairs. The next day, Twining headed north in search of the Japanese fleet, then returned to Okinawan waters on the 31st, and resumed duty as a picket for carrier operations. On the first day in April, the carriers resumed strikes on Okinawa in support of the landings there. On the 6th, the group came under attack from massed kamikazes as Japan vainly tried to repulse the Allied assault. During a two-hour period, Twining's group splashed five kamikazes; but the destroyer was on the opposite side of the formation and had no opportunity for a clear shot. The following day, she screened the carriers as they steamed north to intercept Japanese warships approaching Okinawa. A 380-plane strike located the Japanese ships in the East China Sea, near Amami ≈åshima, and sank superbattleship , light cruiser , and four destroyers. Enemy air activity was frequent; and, on 13 April, Twining chased off an aerial intruder which had approached her picket post. A few days later, she retired to Ulithi for repairs. On 4 May, she again got underway from Ulithi, this time with Task Group 58.1, bound for strikes on Ky≈´sh≈´ in support of operations on Okinawa. As the formation approached the Japanese islands, enemy pilots became bolder; and Twining fired on a number of planes. Throughout the remainder of May and into June, she continued to protect the carrier force as it operated off Okinawa. On 4 June, the barometer reading began to drop; and winds picked up. Winds reached 70 knots (130 km/h) by 06:00, and Twining again faced the might of a typhoon but emerged undamaged and resumed her picket duties late in the day. Following strikes on Ky≈´sh≈´, she detached from the group on 10 June to escort to Leyte. After upkeep and availability in San Pedro Bay, she screened in Leyte Gulf as the carrier exercised a newly assigned air group. Early in July, Twining joined Task Force 38, with Admiral W.F. Halsey embarked in , for seven days of intensive training exercises in preparation for the long-awaited assault on the Japanese homeland. On 10 July, the task force arrived off Tokyo and, four days later, began launching strikes. On the 24th, Twining joined in antishipping sweeps off the Kure-Kobe area and, on the night of 24 and 25 July, took part in the bombardment of Shiono-Misaki airfield. Frequent enemy air activity occurred as Twining screened the carriers. Air strikes against Kure and Kobe late in July were followed early in August by additional strikes against northern Honsh≈´. On 9 August, a kamikaze attempted to crash into Twining but, under intense fire from the ship, overshot the destroyer. At 06:05 on 15 August, Twining heard the carriers recall strikes bound for Tokyo targets; and, two hours later, Radio San Francisco announced the welcome news of Japan's unconditional capitulation. Late in August, Twining stood by in Sagami Wan to provide fire support for the occupation of Yokosuka Naval Base; but the landings took place without incident. The same procedure was repeated at Tateyama Wan on 3 September with the same peaceful result. On the 9th, the destroyer began support of minesweeping activities off Sendai and Choshi; then returned to Tokyo Bay on the 16th for repairs and replenishment. Twining next participated in training exercises before getting underway for the United States on 31 October. She steamed, via Pearl Harbor, with Destroyer Squadron 53 and, on 20 November, entered Puget Sound for overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington On 14 June 1946, she was decommissioned at San Diego, California. Assigned to the Naval Reserve Training Program in August, Twining operated out of west coast ports and made voyages to Hawaii and Mexico as part of her training activities.  1950‚Äì1971  Twining was recommissioned on 10 June 1950. After operations on the west coast, she departed San Diego on 20 August 1951 and steamed, via Hawaii and Japan, to waters off Korea. With Commander, Destroyer Division 172, embarked on Twining, the destroyer joined the screen of Fast Carrier Task Force 77 late in September and also supplied counterbattery fire in support of minesweepers in the vicinity of Hungnam. In October, Twining operated in the waters of Tongjoson Bay, participating in the interdiction of Wonsan harbor where she engaged shore batteries and fired on buildings, road intersections, and railroads. She occasionally supplied fire called for by aircraft or shore fire control centers. On 9 October, the destroyer scored a hit on an ammunition storage area setting off a violent explosion and numerous fires. Two days later, Twining proceeded to Hungnam harbor to thwart communist efforts to remine swept waters there. That night, as she steamed near the channel entrance, an unidentified jet made a quick surprise attack, dropped two bombs, strafed the destroyer, and escaped into the overcast. The bombs dropped nearby, but the destroyer suffered no damage. After sinking a sampan and engaging a shore battery, Twining set her course for Yokosuka. Twining spent November in upkeep and training exercises and devoted December to antisubmarine hunter-killer exercises off Okinawa. On the 11th, she headed for the east coast of Korea for interdiction and close support missions. The destroyer ended the month screening Task Force 77 and began the new year with upkeep at Sasebo. On 22 January 1952, Twining departed Japan to return to Wonsan. There, she fired on vehicles, warehouses, and enemy troop concentrations and, on the 30th, rescued a downed American pilot. She operated in Wonsan harbor until 19 February, when she got underway for Japan. Following voyage repairs, she departed Yokosuka, steamed via Midway and Pearl Harbor for the west coast, and arrived at San Diego on 10 March. She remained in California ports until 1 November 1952 when she sailed for the Far East and her second tour of duty in Korean waters. In the months that followed, she operated off the east coast of Korea, carrying out patrol and reconnaissance missions, firing on shore targets, supplying night illumination for island garrisons in Wonsan harbor and fire support for minesweepers. In March 1953, she anchored in Buckner Bay before moving to Formosa to train personnel of the Chinese Nationalist Navy in gunnery and damage control. On 8 April, she rendezvoused with to provide antisubmarine screening for the carrier and conducted patrols of the North Formosa Strait before returning to Japan in mid-April. In May, the destroyer departed Yokosuka, setting her course for Pearl Harbor and Long Beach. She operated out of California ports throughout the remainder of 1953. Although the Korean War was at an end, Twining continued to alternate cruises in the Far East with operations on the west coast until June 1963 when she returned to San Diego from exercises with the British, New Zealand, and Australian navies. In May 1964, the destroyer was transferred from Destroyer Squadron 5 to Reserve Destroyer Squadron 27 and began conducting training cruises for reserves. After the collision of the Australian aircraft carrier and destroyer , which resulted in the sinking of Voyager on 10 February 1964, the United States offered Twining to Australia along with sister ship as a temporary replacement. The Royal Australian Navy instead accepted the British Royal Navy's offer of the Daring class destroyer , which was of the same class as Voyager. She was decommissioned and stricken from the Navy List on 1 July 1971 and was sold on 16 August 1971 to the Republic of China.  ROCS Kwei Yang (DDG-908)  The ship served in the Republic of China Navy under the name of ROCS Kwei Yang (DDG-908). She was stricken 16 July 1999.  Honors  Twining received eight battle stars for World War II service and five for Korean War service.

He was the recipient of the Fothergill gold medal, awarded by the Medical Society of London in 1854 and of the Astley Cooper triennial prize for an essay in physiology. He was a close personal friend, and professional colleague, of John Snow. On Snow's sudden death he took over the final editing of Snow's draft On Chloroform and Other Anaesthetics and supervised its publication in 1858. Ward Richardson remained a committed exponent of Snow's radical views on the microbial cause of infectious disease for the rest of his life. He continued, and extended, Snow's work on inhalation anaesthesia and brought into clinical use, no less than fourteen anaesthetics, of which methylene bichloride is the best known, and he invented the first double-valved mouthpiece for use in the administration of chloroform. He also made known the peculiar properties of amyl nitrite, a drug which was largely used in the treatment of angina pectoris, and he introduced the bromides of quinine, iron and strychnia, ozonized ether, styptic and iodized colloid, hydrogen peroxide, and sodium ethoxide, substances which were soon largely used by the medical profession. In 1893, he was knighted in recognition of his eminent services to humanitarian causes. Education Richardson was born at Somerby in Leicestershire, the only son of Benjamin Richardson and Mary Ward. He was educated by the Rev. W. Young Nutt at the Burrough Hill school in the same county. Being destined by the deathbed wish of his mother for the medical profession, his studies were always directed to that end, and he was apprenticed early to Henry Hudson, the surgeon at Somerby. He entered Anderson's University (now [University of Strathclyde]), in 1847, but a severe attack of famine fever (either typhus or relapsing fever) that he caught while he was a pupil at St Andrews Lying-in Hospital (now Princess Royal Maternity Hospital), interrupted his studies, and led him to become an assistant, first to Thomas Browne of Saffron Walden in Essex, and afterwards to Edward Dudley Hudson at Littlethorpe, Cosby, near Leicester. Hudson was the elder brother of his former master. In 1854, he was admitted M.A. and M.D. of St Andrews, where he afterwards became a member of the university court, an assessor of the general council, and in 1877, an honorary LL.D. Career Benjamin Ward Richardson In 1849, Richardson left Hudson and joined Dr Robert Willis of Barnes, well known as the editor of the works of William Harvey, and librarian of the Royal College of Surgeons of England (1828‚Äì1845). Richardson lived at Mortlake, and at about this time, became a member of \\"Our Club\\", where he met Douglas Jerrold, William Makepeace Thackeray, William Hepworth Dixon, Mark Lemon, John Doran and George Cruikshank, of whose will he became an executor. In 1850, Richardson was admitted as a licentiate to the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. He became a faculty lecturer in 1877, and was elected a Fellow on 3 June 1878. Richardson was a founder, and for thirty-five times in succession the President of the St Andrews Medical Graduates' Association. He was admitted as a member of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1856, and was elected a Fellow in 1865, serving the office of materia medica lecturer in 1866. In 1867, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and delivered the Croonian lecture in 1873 on \\"The Muscular Irritability after Systemic Death.\\" Richardson moved to London in 1853‚Äì1854, and took a house at 12 Hinde Street, whence he moved to 25 Manchester Square. In 1854, he was appointed physician to the Blenheim Street Dispensary, and in 1856 to the Royal Infirmary for Diseases of the Chest in the City Road. He was also physician to the Metropolitan Dispensary (1856), to the Marylebone, and to the Margaret Street Dispensaries (1856), and in 1892, he became physician to the London Temperance Hospital. For many years he was physician to the \\"Newspaper Press Fund\\" and to the \\"Royal Literary Fund\\", the committee of which, he was long an active member. In 1854, Richardson became a lecturer on forensic medicine at the Grosvenor Place School of Medicine, where he was afterwards appointed the first lecturer on public hygiene, posts which he resigned in 1857 for the lectureship on physiology. He remained dean of the school until 1865, when it was sold and, with all the other buildings in the old Tattersall's yard, demolished. Richardson was also a lecturer about this time at the College of Dentists, then occupying a part of the Polytechnic Institution in Regent Street.president of the health section of the Social Science Association, notably in 1875, when he delivered a celebrated address at Brighton on \\"Hygeia\\", in which he told of what a city should be if sanitary science were advanced in a proper manner. In the same year he gave the Cantor lectures at the Society of Arts, taking \\"alcohol\\" as the subject. In 1854, Richardson was awarded the Fothergillian prize of the Medical Society of London for his essay on the Diseases of the Unborn Child and elected the society's president in 1868. Richardson was elected an honorary member of the Philosophical Society of America in 1863, and of the Imperial Leopold Carolina Academy of Sciences in 1867. He became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1877. In 1880 he was co-opted on to the London School Board. In June 1893, he was knighted in recognition of his eminent services to humanitarian causes. He was elected President of the Association of Public Sanitary Inspectors of Great Britain (later renamed the Sanitary Inspectors Association (SIA)) from 1890 to 1896.Johnson, R (1983) A Century of Progress. IEHO. London Like his predecessor, Sir Edwin Chadwick, he took a close interest in the Association, on many occasions leading deputations to the President of the Local Government Board to argue the case for security of tenure for inspectors against arbitrary dismissal. The local authority employers often consisted of local slum property owners and small businessmen, such as butchers, slaughterhouse owners, mill and factory owners, whose financial interests were affected by the inspectors' efforts. He also argued strongly on behalf of the sanitary inspectors who were for decades excluded from their own Examination and Registration Boards by medical interests who were concerned to keep the inspectors 'in their proper place' and preserve public health administration as a medical domain. His lawyer son Aubrey was also active on behalf of the SIA. In 1862, he published Asclepiad: clinical essays volume 1, intended as a periodical; however, it was not widely received. It was not until 1884 when he published a new series The Asclepiad volume 1, second series, that it received adequate distribution and became a regular quarterly periodical, going under the full-blown title of The Asclepiad: A Book of Original Research and Observation in the Science, Art, and Literature of Medicine, Preventive and Curative. It continued to be published, through eleven volumes, until 1895. Awards In 1854, Richardson was awarded the Fothergillian gold medal by the Medical Society of London for an essay on the \\"Diseases of the Foetus in Utero\\". In 1856, he gained the Astley Cooper triennial prize of 300 guineas for his essay on \\"The Coagulation of the Blood.\\" Epilogue Richardson died at 25 Manchester Square on 21 November 1896, and his body was cremated at Brookwood, Surrey. Richardson was a sanitary reformer, who busied himself with many of the smaller details of domestic sanitation which tend, in the aggregate, to prolong the average life in each generation. He spent many years in attempts to relieve pain among men by discovering and adapting substances capable of producing general or local anaesthesia, and among animals by more humane methods of slaughter. He brought into use, no less than fourteen anaesthetics, of which methylene bichloride is the best known, and he invented the first double-valved mouthpiece for use in the administration of chloroform. He also produced local insensibility by freezing the part with an ether spray, and he gave animals euthanasia by means of a lethal chamber. Richardson was an ardent and determined champion of total abstinence, for he held that alcohol was so powerful a drug that it should only be used by skilled hands in the greatest emergencies. He was also one of the earliest advocates of bicycling; he wrote 'Cycling as an Intellectual Pursuit' for Longman's Magazine in 1883. In 1863, he made known the peculiar properties of amyl nitrite, a drug which was largely used in the treatment of breast-pang (angina pectoris), and he introduced the bromides of quinine, iron and strychnia, ozonized ether, styptic and iodized colloid, peroxide of hydrogen, and ethylate of soda, substances which were soon largely used by the medical profession. Richardson was a Vice-President of the Bread Reform League.Forward, Charles W. (1898). Fifty Years of Food Reform: A History of the Vegetarian Movement in England.

(1972). Health and Food. Applied Science Publishers. p. 16 Richardson opposed the slaughter of animals but was not a vegetarian. He wrote that \\"It is quite true that I lean strongly towards the vegetarian movement. I have not, however, become a strict vegetarian, but have rather busied myself in showing how animals can be painlessly killed and carefully cleansed for the meat- market.\\"Richardson, Benjamin Ward. (1897). Vita Medica: Chapters of Medical Life and Work. Longmans, Green, and Co. p. 269 Richardson was one of the most prolific writers of his generation. He wrote biographies, plays, poems, and songs, in addition to his more strictly scientific work. He wrote the Asclepiad, a series of original researches in the science, art, and literature of medicine. A single volume was issued in 1861, after which it appeared quarterly from 1884 to 1895. He was the originator and the editor of the Journal of Public Health and Sanitary Review (1855). He contributed many articles, signed and unsigned, to The Lancet, The Medical Times and The Gazette. Family He married, on 21 February 1857, Mary J. Smith of Mortlake, by whom he left two surviving sons and one daughter. Works Scene in Hygeia, a City of Health Non-fiction * (1858).

The book describes 40 families and 1066 species of India, many of which were described by Tikader himself. The handbook is a guide to all arachnids including scorpions, and not just spiders. He was also a popular scientific author in his native language of Bengali, and was the author of Banglar Makorsha (literally: \\"Bengal's spiders\\") for the layman. Focus on eastern India Working in the Zoological Survey of India based in Kolkata, Tikader was especially interested in the spiders of eastern India and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Many of his nomenclatures thus bear names of places in eastern India as part of their specific scientific name - like andamanensis (from the Andaman Islands), bengalensis (from the region of Bengal, and dhakuriensis (from the neighbourhood of Dhakuria, in Kolkata, often based on the region of discovery or distribution.

It was consecrated under the rule of Rajuvula, one of the Northern Satraps of the region of Mathura. The capital was unearthed at the Saptarishi mound of Mathura by Bhagwan Lal Indraji in 1869. It is covered with Prakrit inscriptions in the kharoshthi script of northwestern India. The capital was made on the occasion of the funeral of \\"the illustrious king Muki and his horse\\" (Muki has been conjectured to be Maues).

It lies northeast of Varna, from Dobrich on the international road E87 and south of the border with Romania. It is the principal town of Kavarna Municipality, part of Dobrich Province. As of December 2009, the town has a population of 11,397 inhabitants. Bulgarian National Statistical Institute - towns in 2009 ‚ÄûWorldCityPopulation‚Äú‚Äûpop- stat.mashke.org‚Äú A little yacht port, a fishing base, a spacious beach and a resort complex exist in the town. The landmark Cape Kaliakra is located a few kilometers to the east, as is the tiny beachfront resort of Rusalka. Three 18-hole golf courses with villa communities and marinas are being developed nearby, two of the courses are designed by Gary Player and one by Ian Woosnam. During the 2000s, the town became famous with the annual Kaliakra Rock Fest featuring famous rock bands from around the world. Etymology With the Bulgarian conquest in the 7th century AD, the name Karvuna replaced the similarly-sounding ancient Greek Krounoi as the then name of the neighboring modern town of Balchik; the names Karvunska Hora and Principality of Karvuna were related to that town, which was also mentioned on 14th-century Italian portolan charts with the Italianized form Carbona. The name Kavarna as referring to this city was first mentioned in the 15th century; perhaps it was a new name influenced phonetically by the preexisting names of Karvuna (which town was already known as Balchik) and Varna. Geography The lay of the land is flat and the seacoast of Kavarna is long. Along it there are small beaches, including an artificial one. Gore Chirakman with its almost sheer slopes towers above the seacoast. Remains of stronghold walls, moats, buildings, churches and necropolises can be found on the flat plateau. The region is rich in mineral waters. The area around Kavarna offers opportunities for developing ecotourism and specialized tourism ‚Äî examination and photography of plants, dolphins and various kinds of fish in the coastal waters. The variety of birds attracts tourists from all parts of the world and contributes to Kaliakra and Yaylata becoming one of the most preferred places in Bulgaria for the development of ornithological tourism. Population History Kaliakra The town was founded in the 5th century BC by Ancient GreekAn Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis: An Investigation Conducted by The Copenhagen Polis Centre for the Danish National Research Foundation by Mogens Herman Hansen,2005,Index colonists who settled on the Chirakman Plateau in the colony Byzone (or Bizone) (). During the 3rd and 2nd century BC, the town played an important mediating role between the local Thracian settlements and the Greeks. Despite being unsuitable for wharfing because of its rugged cliffs, this part of the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast was an attractive centre due to the fact that the local people produced and traded with high quality grain. During the second part of the 1st century BC the ancient town fell in the sea because of a disastrous earthquake. The frontal part of the Chirakman broke off and together with the richest citizens fell into the Black Sea's waters. According to the leader of the finished first part of the underwater archaeological expedition Kavarna 2005, Asen Salkin, the Roman town of Bizone has sunk two times in the sea. For that evidence the located form skin-divers borders of a sunk residential district of the town of Bizone in Kavarna's coast. For the presence of residential buildings the archaeologists judge by the found ashlars and parts of brick walls. The finds date from the 2nd century AD. According to the leader of the expedition this residential district has nothing in common with the disastrous earthquake from the 1st century BC. The underwater finds evidence for other phenomenon, for which the scientists express only suppositions, such as transgression and regression of the strata. It has started to transgress during the 1st century AD and this has continued to the 2nd century. It is possible that during this period the coast had risen by four metres and one day it suddenly fallen through. During Roman times the town was restored under the same name and quickly flourished, the settlement revived and the port brightened up. View of Kavarna Kavarna fortress plan In the 7th century AD the Slavs and Asparuh's Bulgars destroyed the Byzantine town and later founded a new settlement, which entered the First Bulgarian Empire. In the late Middle Ages the settlement grew and was subject to Tatar raids; in the 14th century it became part of the Principality of Karvuna, which de facto broke away from the Second Bulgarian Empire under the rule of the despots Balik and Dobrotitsa of the Bulgarian royal Terter dynasty.–ì. –ë–∞–∫–∞–ª–æ–≤, –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –Ω–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—Ç–µ, –¢–æ–º 1, 2003, —Å. 457–ü–µ—Ç—ä—Ä –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–æ–≤, –°–∫–≤–∏—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ –∫–Ω—è–∑–µ –ü–æ–ª–æ–≤—Ü–∏-–†–æ–∂–∏–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏ ‚Äî –∫–ª–æ–Ω –Ω–∞ –¥–∏–Ω–∞—Å—Ç–∏—è—Ç–∞ –¢–µ—Ä—Ç–µ—Ä, online, retrieved 03-24-2007 In 1397, the Ottoman Turks nearly destroyed the city, which was abandoned but resettled again and rebuilt by the early 17th century. Its present name was documented for the first time in the early 15th century. The town was considered an economical and cultural centre during Antiquity and the Middle Ages with rich and various remains ‚Äì stronghold walls, early- Christian basilica, medieval churches, and public buildings. Notable works of art, such as coins from different historical epochs, golden adornments, a golden Thracian treasure of applications, have been found in the area. Between the 15th and 19th century the town becomes popular under the name Kavarna, as a Christian settlement and port for grain export. From that time remain a Turkish bath, a medieval necropolis, a bridge, fountains, Christian churches and many inscriptions. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878 Kavarna's Christian inhabitants, Bulgarians and Gagauz alike, rebelled against the bashi-bazouks and Circassian hordes. After the liberation the town became part of the Principality of Bulgaria. From the beginning of 20th century Kavarna achieved a rapid progress as an economical and cultural centre. The town renamed Cavarna came under Romanian rule after the Second Balkan War in 1913 and again after the First World War in 1919. This however, was met with resistance by the local Bulgarian population and its Internal Dobrujan Revolutionary Organisation. In 1940 the town was ceded back to Bulgaria by the Treaty of Craiova. Monuments and museums =Dobruja and the Sea Display= The Dobruja and the Sea Display is a small maritime museum. It is situated in an approximately restored Turkish bath, the Hamam. It was built in the beginning of the 15th century and represents a massive beehive bath from stone, situated in the beginning of the valley leading to the port, and half a kilometre apart from the town centre. Many stone anchors, amphorae and ceramics found during the underwater archaeological expeditions are exposed there. Coins from different epochs and a golden Thracian treasure can be seen in the Treasure House Hall The ancient and mediaeval colour painting expend our concepts for the ancient navigation around Dobruja's coasts. =Town Museum= The Town Museum can be found in the building of the local library. Materials, revealing the thousand-year old history of the town are displayed in its exposition. Evidence for the life of the people in the region since ancient times are represented here. A model of prehistoric cave-dwellings, many tools, guns, rifles and pistols from the War of Liberation, as well as ethnographic materials ‚Äî clothing, finery, folk-style cloth, are also exhibited =Ethnographic Museum= Dormition of the Theotokos Church. The Ethnographic Museum represents an old house from the end of the 19th century that belonged to a rich family. Its interior reveals the customs and culture of the people inhabiting that part of the country; premises typical for Dobruja houses, tools from the culture and the daily round of the people. The building is surrounded by a garden full of mulberry trees, peonies and tulips. =Churches= There are two churches in the town both located in the town centre. The Church of Saint George was built in 1836 and the Dormition of the Theotokos Church in 1860. Both churches played an important role during the Ottoman rule and after the Liberation as educational and cultural centers. =The old fountains= These were 12 spring fountains situated along the valley to the port. Some of them were destroyed and the rest were restored recently. The great amount of spring water forms a small river. Culture Since 2004 the town has turned in one of the centres of musical life in Bulgaria. Kavarna has been the host to several rock and roll concerts. In 2005 the most popular band to play in the town's stadium was Deep Purple. The other notable performers were mostly legends of German rock and heavy metal music, such as Scorpions, Axel Rudi Pell, Gamma Ray, Masterplan and Destruction. On 27 August 2005 Accept, another German band, played here its last show with original lead vocalist Udo Dirkschneider. There is also a mural of Whitesnake singer David Coverdale. 2006 saw the start of the Kaliakra Rock Fest - A Metal festival (renamed to Kavarna Rock Fest in 2010) including many metal bands. The same year followed the tradition with concerts of more metal bands as well as some pop and dance musicians. For example, Russian pop star Filipp Kirkorov sang there in September. In 2007, performers included Heaven and Hell, John Lawton Band, Manowar, Mot√∂rhead, Robert Plant, and Ronnie James Dio. The next year saw the return of Manowar within Kaliakra Rock Fest with a 5-hour attempt to set a world record for the longest heavy metal concert. The next two days Alice Cooper, Slayer and In Flames held concerts. In July 2009, M√∂tley Cr√ºe headlined the rock-fest, with Scorpions, Blind Guardian and Dream Theater also participating. Sonata Arctica also performed in 2008 and 2011. The 2013 Volvo World Match Play Championship was held at the Thracian Cliffs Golf Course.

History The tradition of midnight Mass on Christmas Eve was first chronicled by Egeria, a Galician woman who went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land around 381‚Äì384. She witnessed how the early Catholics of Jerusalem honored the Christmas mystery with a midnight vigil at Bethlehem. This was followed by a torchlight procession to Jerusalem, arriving at the Church of the Resurrection at dawn. Half a century later, Pope Sixtus III, inspired by the midnight vigil, instituted the practice of a midnight Mass after the cockcrow in the grotto- like oratory of the famed Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. There are discrepancies, however, as to the exact time of the cockcrow due to the fact that the ancient Romans set it at the start of the day. In 1587, the head monk of the Convent of San Agustin Acolman, San Diego de Soria, petitioned the Pope to allow the Mass to be held outdoors because the church could not accommodate the large number of attendees at the evening celebration. Misa de Gallo in different countries The tradition of Misa de Gallo is still observed today, mostly by Spanish-speaking Roman Catholic countries in Latin America and in the Philippines. =Spain= In Spain, locals begin Christmas Eve by lighting small oil lamps in every home, then proceed to church to hear Midnight Mass. The most popular of these holy services is in the Bas√≠lica de Montserrat also known as Santa Maria de Montserrat, a Benedictine monastery built on the steep cliffs of the Montserrat mountain range. The Escolania de Montserrat, Europe's oldest boys' choir known for their angelic voices, graces the celebration. =Bolivia= Bolivians attend Christmas Eve Mass, and the celebration is followed by a sit-down meal featuring a traditional bowl of picana del pollo. It is a stew made of chicken with peas, carrots, and potatoes. =Philippines= Simbang Gabi (Tagalog for \\"Night Mass\\") is the Filipino version of the Misa de Gallo (sometimes referred to as Misa de Aguinaldo, \\"gift mass\\") and in Zamboangue√±o Chavacano it is referred to as \\"Misa de Gallo\\" or \\"Misa de Aguinaldo\\" or \\"Misa de los Pastores\\", and traditionally begins on December 16 and ends on December 24. =Venezuela= In Venezuela, the Misa de Gallo is only one of a series of Masses held at dawn called Misa de Aguinaldo. The name comes from the Spanish word for \\"Christmas box\\". The Masses are held for nine days and culminate on Christmas Eve. =Puerto Rico= Puerto Ricans celebrate the Mass by singing Christmas songs, which they call aguinaldos.

There are many small variations (or perturbations) in the Moon's motion, and many attempts have been made to account for them. After centuries of being problematic, lunar motion is now modeled to a very high degree of accuracy (see section Modern developments). Lunar theory includes: * the background of general theory; including mathematical techniques used to analyze the Moon's motion and to generate formulae and algorithms for predicting its movements; and also * quantitative formulae, algorithms, and geometrical diagrams that may be used to compute the Moon's position for a given time; often by the help of tables based on the algorithms. Lunar theory has a history of over 2000 years of investigation. Its more modern developments have been used over the last three centuries for fundamental scientific and technological purposes, and are still being used in that way. Applications Applications of lunar theory have included the following: * In the eighteenth century, comparison between lunar theory and observation was used to test Newton's law of universal gravitation by the motion of the lunar apogee. * In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, navigational tables based on lunar theory, initially in the Nautical Almanac, were much used for the determination of longitude at sea by the method of lunar distances. * In the very early twentieth century, comparison between lunar theory and observation was used in another test of gravitational theory, to test (and rule out) Simon Newcomb's suggestion that a well-known discrepancy in the motion of the perihelion of Mercury might be explained by a fractional adjustment of the power -2 in Newton's inverse square law of gravitationE W Brown (1903). (the discrepancy was later successfully explained by the general theory of relativity). * In the mid- twentieth century, before the development of atomic clocks, lunar theory and observation were used in combination to implement an astronomical time scale (ephemeris time) free of the irregularities of mean solar time. * In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, modern developments of lunar theory are being used in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris series of models of the Solar System, in conjunction with high-precision observations, to test the exactness of physical relationships associated with the general theory of relativity, including the strong equivalence principle, relativistic gravitation, geodetic precession, and the constancy of the gravitational constant.J.G. Williams et al., (2004). History The Moon has been observed for millennia. Over these ages, various levels of care and precision have been possible, according to the techniques of observation available at any time. There is a correspondingly long history of lunar theories: it stretches from the times of the Babylonian and Greek astronomers, down to modern lunar laser ranging. Among notable astronomers and mathematicians down the ages, whose names are associated with lunar theories, are: ; Babylonian/Chaldean: * Naburimannu * Kidinnu * Soudines ; Greek/Hellenistic: * Hipparchus * Ptolemy ; Arab: * Ibn al-Shatir ; European, 16th to early 20th centuries: * Tycho Brahe * Johannes Kepler * Jeremiah Horrocks * Isma√´l Bullialdus * John Flamsteed * Isaac Newton * Edmond Halley * Leonhard Euler * Alexis Clairaut * Jean d'Alembert * Tobias Mayer * Johann Tobias B√ºrg * Pierre-Simon Laplace * Philippe le Doulcet * Johann Karl Burckhardt * Peter Andreas Hansen * Charles-Eug√®ne Delaunay * John Couch Adams ; North American, 19th to early 20th centuries: * Simon Newcomb * George William Hill * Ernest William Brown * Wallace John Eckert Other notable mathematicians and mathematical astronomers also made significant contributions. The history can be considered to fall into three parts: from ancient times to Newton; the period of classical (Newtonian) physics; and modern developments. Ancient times to Newton =Babylon= Of Babylonian astronomy, practically nothing was known to historians of science before the 1880s.Neugebauer (1975), volume 1, pp. 347‚Äì348. Surviving ancient writings of Pliny had made bare mention of three astronomical schools in Mesopotamia ‚Äì at Babylon, Uruk, and 'Hipparenum' (possibly 'Sippar').Neugebauer (1975), volume 1, p. 352. But definite modern knowledge of any details only began when Joseph Epping deciphered cuneiform texts on clay tablets from a Babylonian archive: In these texts he identified an ephemeris of positions of the Moon.Neugebauer (1975), volume 1, p. 349, citing Epping & Strassmaier (1881). Since then, knowledge of the subject, still fragmentary, has had to be built up by painstaking analysis of deciphered texts, mainly in numerical form, on tablets from Babylon and Uruk (no trace has yet been found of anything from the third school mentioned by Pliny). To the Babylonian astronomer Kidinnu (in Greek or Latin, Kidenas or Cidenas) has been attributed the invention (5th or 4th century BC) of what is now called ‚ÄúSystem B‚Äù for predicting the position of the moon, taking account that the moon continually changes its speed along its path relative to the background of fixed stars. This system involved calculating daily stepwise changes of lunar speed, up or down, with a minimum and a maximum approximately each month.Neugebauer (1975), volume 1, pp. 476‚Äì482. The basis of these systems appears to have been arithmetical rather than geometrical, but they did approximately account for the main lunar inequality now known as the equation of the center. The Babylonians kept very accurate records for hundreds of years of new moons and eclipses. Some time between the years 500 BC and 400 BC they identified and began to use the 19 year cyclic relation between lunar months and solar years now known as the Metonic cycle.Neugebauer (1975), volume 1, pp. 354, 474. This helped them built up a numerical theory of the main irregularities in the Moon's motion, reaching remarkably good estimates for the (different) periods of the three most prominent features of the Moon's motion: * The synodic month, i.e. the mean period for the phases of the Moon. Now called ‚ÄúSystem B‚Äù, it reckons the synodic month as 29 days and (sexagesimally) 3,11;0,50 ‚Äútime degrees‚Äù. Each time degree is one degree of the apparent motion of the stars, or 4 minutes of time, and the sexagesimal values after the semicolon are fractions of a time degree. This converts to 29.530594 days = 29·µà 12 ∞ 44·µê 3.33À¢,Neugebauer (1975), volume 1, p. 483. to compare with a modern value (as at 1900 Jan 0) of 29.530589 days, or 29·µà 12 ∞ 44·µê 2.9À¢.Explanatory Supplement (1961) to the Astronomical Ephemeris, p. 107. This same value was used by Hipparchos and Ptolemy, was used throughout the Middle Ages, and still forms the basis of the Hebrew calendar. * The mean lunar velocity relative to the stars they estimated at 13¬∞ 10‚Ä≤ 35‚Ä≥ per day, giving a corresponding month of 27.321598 days,Neugebauer (1975), volume 1, pp. 476‚Äì478. to compare with modern values of 13¬∞ 10‚Ä≤ 35.0275‚Ä≥ and 27.321582 days. * The anomalistic month, i.e. the mean period for the Moon's approximately monthly accelerations and decelerations in its rate of movement against the stars, had a Babylonian estimate of 27.5545833 days,Neugebauer (1975), volume 1, p. 501. to compare with a modern value 27.554551 days. * The draconitic month, i.e. the mean period with which the path of the Moon against the stars deviates first north and then south in ecliptic latitude by comparison with the ecliptic path of the Sun, was indicated by a number of different parameters leading to various estimates, e.g. of 27.212204 days,Neugebauer (1975), volume 1, to compare with a modern value of 27.212221, but the Babylonians also had a numerical relationship that 5458 synodic months were equal to 5923 draconitic months, which when compared with their accurate value for the synodic month leads to practically exactly the modern figure for the draconitic month. The Babylonian estimate for the synodic month was adopted for the greater part of two millennia by Hipparchus, Ptolemy, and medieval writers (and it is still in use as part of the basis for the calculated Hebrew (Jewish) calendar). =Greece and Hellenistic Egypt= Thereafter, from Hipparchus and Ptolemy in the Bithynian and Ptolemaic epochs down to the time of Newton's work in the seventeenth century, lunar theories were composed mainly with the help of geometrical ideas, inspired more or less directly by long series of positional observations of the moon. Prominent in these geometrical lunar theories were combinations of circular motions ‚Äì applications of the theory of epicycles.J L E Dreyer (1906), especially chapter 7. Hipparchus Hipparchus, whose works are mostly lost and known mainly from quotations by other authors, assumed that the Moon moved in a circle inclined at 5¬∞ to the ecliptic, rotating in a retrograde direction (i.e. opposite to the direction of annual and monthly apparent movements of the Sun and Moon relative to the fixed stars) once in 18 years. The circle acted as a deferent, carrying an epicycle along which the Moon was assumed to move in a retrograde direction. The center of the epicycle moved at a rate corresponding to the mean change in Moon's longitude, while the period of the Moon around the epicycle was an anomalistic month. This epicycle approximately provided for what was later recognized as the elliptical inequality, the equation of the center, and its size approximated to an equation of the center of about 5¬∞ 1'. This figure is much smaller than the modern value: but it is close to the difference between the modern coefficients of the equation of the center (1st term) and that of the evection: the difference is accounted for by the fact that the ancient measurements were taken at times of eclipses, and the effect of the evection (which subtracts under those conditions from the equation of the center) was at that time unknown and overlooked. For further information see also separate article Evection. Ptolemy Ptolemy's work the Almagest had wide and long-lasting acceptance and influence for over a millennium. He gave a geometrical lunar theory that improved on that of Hipparchus by providing for a second inequality of the Moon's motion, using a device that made the apparent apogee oscillate a little ‚Äì prosneusis of the epicycle. This second inequality or second anomaly accounted rather approximately, not only for the equation of the center, but also for what became known (much later) as the evection. But this theory, applied to its logical conclusion, would make the distance (and apparent diameter) of the Moon appear to vary by a factor of about 2, which is clearly not seen in reality.Neugebauer (1975), volume 1, pp. 85‚Äì88. (The apparent angular diameter of the Moon does vary monthly, but only over a much narrower range of about 0.49¬∞‚Äì0.55¬∞.See e.g. Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris for 1871, especially p. 224 (Dec 1871), (showing range of Moon's diameters near its widest for the half-year, ranging 0.491¬∞‚Äì0.559¬∞ 12‚Äì26 Dec 1871, to compare with other nearby months e.g. Aug‚ÄìNov where the range is not so wide).) This defect of the Ptolemaic theory led to proposed replacements by Ibn al-Shatir in the 14th centuryGeorge Saliba (1994). A History of Arabic Astronomy: Planetary Theories During the Golden Age of Islam, p. 236\\\\. New York University Press, . and by Copernicus in the 16th century.J L E Dreyer (1906), especially chapter 9. =Ibn al-Shatir and Copernicus= Significant advances in lunar theory were made by the Arab astronomer, Ibn al-Shatir (1304‚Äì1375). Drawing on the observation that the distance to the Moon did not change as drastically as required by Ptolemy's lunar model, he produced a new lunar model that replaced Ptolemy's crank mechanism with a double epicycle model that reduced the computed range of distances of the Moon from the Earth.Neugebauer (1975), volume 3, pp. 1108‚Äì1109. A similar lunar theory, developed some 150 years later by the Renaissance astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, had the same advantage concerning the lunar distances.Neugebauer (1975), volume 3, p. 1109. =Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, and Jeremiah Horrocks= Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler refined the Ptolemaic lunar theory, but did not overcome its central defect of giving a poor account of the (mainly monthly) variations in the Moon's distance, apparent diameter and parallax. Their work added to the lunar theory three substantial further discoveries. # The nodes and the inclination of the lunar orbital plane both appear to librate, with a monthly (according to Tycho) or semi-annual period (according to Kepler). # The lunar longitude has a twice-monthly Variation, by which the Moon moves faster than expected at new and full moon, and slower than expected at the quarters. # There is also an annual effect, by which the lunar motion slows down a little in January and speeds up a little in July: the annual equation. The refinements of Brahe and Kepler were recognized by their immediate successors as improvements, but their seventeenth-century successors tried numerous alternative geometrical configurations for the lunar motions to improve matters further. A notable success was achieved by Jeremiah Horrocks, who proposed a scheme involving an approximate 6 monthly libration in the position of the lunar apogee and also in the size of the elliptical eccentricity. This scheme had the great merit of giving a more realistic description of the changes in distance, diameter and parallax of the Moon. Newton A first gravitational period for lunar theory started with the work of Newton. He was the first to define the problem of the perturbed motion of the Moon in recognisably modern terms. His groundbreaking work is shown for example in the PrincipiaEnglish translations of the Principia (3rd edition, 1726) have been made by: I B Cohen (1999), a modern English translation with Guide; also Andrew Motte (translator) (1729a) (the original English translation, Volume 1, containing Book 1); and Andrew Motte (translator) (1729b) (Volume 2, containing Books 2 and 3, index, additional Newton papers and a tract on the Moon by John Machin). in all versions including the first edition published in 1687. =Solar perturbation of lunar motion= Newton identified how to evaluate the perturbing effect on the relative motion of the Earth and Moon, arising from their gravity towards the Sun, in Book 1, Proposition 66,'Principia', Andrew Motte (1729a), at Book 1, Prop. 66, p. 234, referring to diagram \\"Fig.2\\" on an unnumbered page following next after p. 268. and in Book 3, Proposition 25.'Principia', Andrew Motte (1729b), at Book 3, Prop. 25, p. 262. The starting-point for this approach is Corollary VI to the laws of motion.'Principia', Andrew Motte (1729a), at Corollary VI to the laws of motion, p. 31. This shows that if the external accelerative forces from some massive body happens to act equally and in parallel on some different other bodies considered, then those bodies would be affected equally, and in that case their motions (relative to each other) would continue as if there were no such external accelerative forces at all. It is only in the case that the external forces (e.g. in Book 1, Prop. 66, and Book 3, Prop. 25, the gravitational attractions towards the Sun) are different in size or in direction in their accelerative effects on the different bodies considered (e.g. on the Earth and Moon), that consequent effects are appreciable on the relative motions of the latter bodies. (Newton referred to accelerative forces or accelerative gravity due to some external massive attractor such as the Sun. The measure he used was the acceleration that the force tends to produce (in modern terms, force per unit mass), rather than what we would now call the force itself.) Thus Newton concluded that it is only the difference between the Sun's accelerative attraction on the Moon and the Sun's attraction on the Earth that perturbs the motion of the Moon relative to the Earth. Newton then in effect used vector decomposition of forces,Principia, Andrew Motte (1729a); where Newton shows the parallelogram of forces at Corollary I to the laws of motion, p. 21. to carry out this analysis. In Book 1, Proposition 66 and in Book 3, Proposition 25,'Principia', Andrew Motte (1729b), at Book 3, Proposition 25, p. 262. he showed by a geometrical construction, starting from the total gravitational attraction of the Sun on the Earth, and of the Sun on the Moon, the difference that represents the perturbing effect on the motion of the Moon relative to the Earth. In summary, line LS in Newton's diagram as shown below represents the size and direction of the perturbing acceleration acting on the Moon in the Moon's current position P (line LS does not pass through point P, but the text shows that this is not intended to be significant, it is a result of the scale factors and the way the diagram has been built up). Newton's diagram 'to find the force of the Sun to perturb the Moon' accompanying Book 3, Proposition 25 of the Principia Shown here is Newton's diagram from the first (1687) Latin edition of the Principia (Book 3, Proposition 25, p. 434). Here he introduced his analysis of perturbing accelerations on the Moon in the Sun-Earth-Moon system. Q represents the Sun, S the Earth, and P the Moon. Parts of this diagram represent distances, other parts gravitational accelerations (attractive forces per unit mass). In a dual significance, SQ represents the Earth-Sun distance, and then it also represents the size and direction of the Earth-Sun gravitational acceleration. Other distances in the diagram are then in proportion to distance SQ. Other attractions are in proportion to attraction SQ. The Sun's attractions are SQ (on the Earth) and LQ (on the Moon). The size of LQ is drawn so that the ratio of attractions LQ:SQ is the inverse square of the ratio of distances PQ:SQ. (Newton constructs KQ=SQ, giving an easier view of the proportions.) The Earth's attraction on the Moon acts along direction PS. (But line PS signifies only distance and direction so far, nothing has been defined about the scale factor between solar and terrestrial attractions). After showing solar attractions LQ on the Moon and SQ on the Earth, on the same scale, Newton then makes a vector decomposition of LQ into components LM and MQ. Then he identifies the perturbing acceleration on the Moon as the difference of this from SQ. SQ and MQ are parallel to each other, so SQ can be directly subtracted from MQ, leaving MS. The resulting difference, after subtracting SQ from LQ, is therefore the vector sum of LM and MS: these add up to a perturbing acceleration LS. Later Newton identified another resolution of the perturbing acceleration LM+MS = LS, into orthogonal components: a transverse component parallel to LE, and a radial component, effectively ES. Alternative depiction of solar perturbations, vectors LS1 and LS2, like LS in Newton's diagram above, for 2 positions of the Moon P in its orbit around the Earth S Newton's diagrammatic scheme, since his time, has been re-presented in other and perhaps visually clearer ways. Shown here is a vector presentationVector diagram adapted in part from indicating, for two different positions, P1 and P2, of the Moon in its orbit around the Earth, the respective vectors LS1 and LS2 for the perturbing acceleration due to the Sun. The Moon's position at P1 is fairly close to what it was at P in Newton's diagram; corresponding perturbation LS1 is like Newton's LS in size and direction. At another position P2, the Moon is farther away from the Sun than the Earth is, the Sun's attraction LQ2 on the Moon is weaker than the Sun's attraction SQ=SQ2 on the Earth, and then the resulting perturbation LS2 points obliquely away from the Sun. Solar perturbation vectors (arrows) analogous to LS at many positions of the Moon in its orbit around the Earth Constructions like those in Newton's diagram can be repeated for many different positions of the Moon in its orbit. For each position, the result is a perturbation vector like LS1 or LS2 in the second diagram. Shown here is an often-presented form of the diagram that summarises sizes and directions of the perturbation vectors for many different positions of the Moon in its orbit. Each small arrow is a perturbation vector like LS, applicable to the Moon in the particular position around the orbit from which the arrow begins. The perturbations on the Moon when it is nearly in line along the Earth-Sun axis, i.e. near new or full moon, point outwards, away from the Earth. When the Moon-Earth line is 90¬∞ from the Earth-Sun axis they point inwards, towards the Earth, with a size that is only half the maximum size of the axial (outwards) perturbations. (Newton gave a rather good quantitative estimate for the size of the solar perturbing force: at quadrature where it adds to the Earth's attraction he put it at of the mean terrestrial attraction, and twice as much as that at the new and full moons where it opposes and diminishes the Earth's attraction.) Newton also showed that the same pattern of perturbation applies, not only to the Moon, in its relation to the Earth as disturbed by the Sun, but also to other particles more generally in their relation to the solid Earth as disturbed by the Sun (or by the Moon); for example different portions of the tidal waters at the Earth's surface.The overall tide-generating force on the Earth's tidal waters results from the superposition of two of these similar patterns, one of them due to the Sun, the other due to the Moon as external perturbing body. The superposition varies in its overall effect depending on the angular relation of Sun and Moon at the considered time. The study of the common pattern of these perturbing accelerations grew out of Newton's initial study of the perturbations of the Moon, which he also applied to the forces moving tidal waters. Nowadays this common pattern itself has become often known as a tidal force whether it is being applied to the disturbances of the motions of the Moon, or of the Earth's tidal waters ‚Äì or of the motions of any other object that suffers perturbations of analogous pattern. After introducing his diagram 'to find the force of the Sun to perturb the Moon' in Book 3, Proposition 25, Newton developed a first approximation to the solar perturbing force, showing in further detail how its components vary as the Moon follows its monthly path around the Earth. He also took the first steps in investigating how the perturbing force shows its effects by producing irregularities in the lunar motions.In this part of the enterprise, Newton's success was more limited: it is relatively uncomplicated to define the perturbing forces, but heavy complexities soon arise in the problem of working out the resulting motions, and these were to challenge mathematical astronomers for two centuries after Newton's initial definition of the problem and indication of the directions to take in solving it. For a selected few of the lunar inequalities, Newton showed in some quantitative detail how they arise from the solar perturbing force. Much of this lunar work of Newton's was done in the 1680s, and the extent and accuracy of his first steps in the gravitational analysis was limited by several factors, including his own choice to develop and present the work in what was, on the whole, a difficult geometrical way, and by the limited accuracy and uncertainty of many astronomical measurements in his time. Classical gravitational period after Newton The main aim of Newton's successors, from Leonhard Euler, Alexis Clairaut and Jean d'Alembert in the mid-eighteenth century, down to E.W. Brown in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, was to account completely and much more precisely for the moon's motions on the basis of Newton's laws, i.e. the laws of motion and of universal gravitation by attractions inversely proportional to the squares of the distances between the attracting bodies. They also wished to put the inverse-square law of gravitation to the test, and for a time in the 1740s it was seriously doubted, on account of what was then thought to be a large discrepancy between the Newton-theoretical and the observed rates in the motion of the lunar apogee. However Clairaut showed shortly afterwards (1749‚Äì50) that at least the major cause of the discrepancy lay not in the lunar theory based on Newton's laws, but in excessive approximations that he and others had relied on to evaluate it. Most of the improvements in theory after Newton were made in algebraic form: they involved voluminous and highly laborious amounts of infinitesimal calculus and trigonometry. It also remained necessary, for completing the theories of this period, to refer to observational measurements.H Godfray (1885).E W Brown (1896).E W Brown (1919).W J Eckert et al. (1954) =Results of the theories= The lunar theorists used (and invented) many different mathematical approaches to analyse the gravitational problem. Not surprisingly, their results tended to converge. From the time of the earliest gravitational analysts among Newton's successors, Euler, Clairaut and d'Alembert, it was recognized that nearly all of the main lunar perturbations could be expressed in terms of just a few angular arguments and coefficients. These can be represented by: * the mean motions or positions of the Moon and the Sun, together with three coefficients and three angular positions, which together define the shape and location of their apparent orbits: * the two eccentricities ( e , about 0.0549, and e' , about 0.01675) of the ellipses that approximate to the apparent orbits of the Moon and the Sun; * the angular direction of the perigees ( \\\\Gamma and \\\\Gamma' ) (or their opposite points the apogees) of the two orbits; and * the angle of inclination ( i , mean value about 18523\\") between the planes of the two orbits, together with the direction ( \\\\Omega ) of the line of nodes in which those two planes intersect. The ascending node ( \\\\Omega ) is the node passed by the Moon when it is tending northwards relative to the ecliptic. From these basic parameters, just four basic differential angular arguments are enough to express, in their different combinations, nearly all of the most significant perturbations of the lunar motions. They are given here with their conventional symbols due to Delaunay; they are sometimes known as the Delaunay arguments: * l the Moon's mean anomaly (angular distance of the mean longitude of the Moon from the mean longitude of its perigee \\\\Gamma); * l' the Sun's mean anomaly (angular distance of the mean longitude of the Sun from the mean longitude of its perigee \\\\Gamma'); * F the Moon's mean argument of latitude (angular distance of the mean longitude of the Moon from the mean longitude of its ascending (northward-bound) node \\\\Omega); * D the Moon's mean (solar) elongation (angular distance of the mean longitude of the Moon from the mean longitude of the Sun). This work culminated into Brown's lunar theory (1897‚Äì1908)E W Brown (1897).E W Brown (1899).E W Brown (1900).E W Brown (1905).E W Brown (1908). and Tables of the Motion of the Moon (1919). These were used in the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac until 1968, and in a modified form until 1984. =Largest or named lunar inequalities= Several of the largest lunar perturbations in longitude (contributions to the difference in its true ecliptic longitude relative to its mean longitude) have been named. In terms of the differential arguments, they can be expressed in the following way, with coefficients rounded to the nearest second of arc (\\"):E W Brown (1919), pp. 8‚Äì28. Equation of the center * The Moon's equation of the center, or elliptic inequality, was known at least in approximation, to the ancients from the Babylonians and Hipparchus onwards. Knowledge of more recent date is that it corresponds to the approximate application of Kepler's law of equal areas in an elliptical orbit, and represents the speeding-up of the Moon as its distance from the Earth decreases while it moves towards its perigee, and then its slowing down as its distance from the Earth increases while it moves towards its apogee. The effect on the Moon's longitude can be approximated by a series of terms, of which the first three are +22639\\\\sin(l) +769\\\\sin(2l) +36\\\\sin(3l) . Evection * The evection (or its approximation) was known to Ptolemy, but its name and knowledge of its cause dates from the 17th century. Its effect on the Moon's longitude has an odd- appearing period of about 31.8 days. This can be represented in a number of ways, for example as the result of an approximate 6-monthly libration in the position of perigee, with an accompanying 6-monthly pulsation in the size of the Moon's orbital eccentricity.H Godfray (1885), pp. 68‚Äì71. Its principal term is +4586\\\\sin(2D-l) . Variation * The Variation, discovered by Tycho Brahe, is a speeding-up of the Moon as it approaches new-moon and full- moon, and a slowing-down as it approaches first and last quarter. Its gravitational explanation with a quantitative estimate was first given by Newton. Its principal term is +2370\\\\sin(2D) . Annual equation * The annual equation, also discovered by Brahe, was qualitatively explained by Newton in terms that the Moon's orbit becomes slightly expanded in size, and longer in period, when the Earth is at perihelion closest to the Sun at the beginning of January, and the Sun's perturbing effect is strongest, and then slightly contracted in size and shorter in period when the Sun is most distant in early July, so that its perturbing effect is weaker: the modern value for the principal term due to this effect is -668\\\\sin(l') . Parallactic inequality * The parallactic inequality, first found by Newton, makes Brahe's Variation a little asymmetric as a result of the finite distance and non-zero parallax of the Sun. Its effect is that the Moon is a little behind at first quarter, and a little ahead at last quarter. Its principal term is -125\\\\sin(D) . Reduction to the ecliptic * The reduction to the ecliptic represents the geometric effect of expressing the Moon's motion in terms of a longitude in the plane of the ecliptic, although its motion is really taking place in a plane that is inclined by about 5 degrees. Its principal term is -412\\\\sin(2F) . The analysts of the mid-18th century expressed the perturbations of the Moon's position in longitude using about 25-30 trigonometrical terms. However, work in the nineteenth and twentieth century led to very different formulations of the theory so these terms are no longer current. The number of terms needed to express the Moon's position with the accuracy sought at the beginning of the twentieth century was over 1400; and the number of terms needed to emulate the accuracy of modern numerical integrations based on laser-ranging observations is in the tens of thousands: there is no limit to the increase in number of terms needed as requirements of accuracy increase.The motion of the moon, Alan Cook, published Adam Hilger, 1988 Modern developments = Digital computers and lunar laser ranging = The Laser Ranging Facility at Goddard Spaceflight Center Since the Second World War and especially since the 1960s, lunar theory has been further developed in a somewhat different way. This has been stimulated in two ways: on the one hand, by the use of automatic digital computation, and on the other hand, by modern observational data-types, with greatly increased accuracy and precision. Wallace John Eckert, a student of Ernest William Brown who worked at IBM, used the experimental digital computers developed there after the Second World War for computation of astronomical ephemerides. One of the projects was to put Brown's lunar theory into the machine and evaluate the expressions directly. Another project was something entirely new: a numerical integration of the equations of motion for the Sun and the four major planets. This became feasible only after electronic digital computers became available. Eventually this led to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris series. In the meantime, Brown's theory was improved with better constants and the introduction of Ephemeris Time and the removal of some empirical corrections associated with this. This led to the Improved Lunar Ephemeris (ILE), which, with some minor successive improvements, was used in the astronomical almanacs from 1960 through 1983M Chapront-Touz√© & J Chapront (2002), pp. 21‚Äì22.ILE j=0 from 1960 to 1967, ILE j=1 from 1968 to 1971, ILE j=2 from 1972 to 1983. and was used in lunar landing missions. The most significant improvement of position observations of the Moon have been the Lunar Laser Ranging measurements, obtained using Earth-bound lasers and special retroreflectors placed on the surface of the Moon. The time-of-flight of a pulse of laser light to one of the retroreflectors and back gives a measure of the Moon's distance at that time. The first of five retroreflectors that are operational today was taken to the Moon in the Apollo 11 spacecraft in July 1969 and placed in a suitable position on the Moon's surface by Neil Armstrong.J O Dickey et al. (1994) Its precision is still being extended further by the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation, established in 2005. = Numerical integrations, relativity, tides, librations = The lunar theory, as developed numerically to fine precision using these modern measures, is based on a larger range of considerations than the classical theories: It takes account not only of gravitational forces (with relativistic corrections) but also of many tidal and geophysical effects and a greatly extended theory of lunar libration. Like many other scientific fields this one has now developed so as to be based on the work of large teams and institutions. An institution notably taking one of the leading parts in these developments has been the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at California Institute of Technology; and names particularly associated with the transition, from the early 1970s onwards, from classical lunar theories and ephemerides towards the modern state of the science include those of J. Derral Mulholland and J.G. Williams, and for the linked development of solar system (planetary) ephemerides E. Myles Standish.Representative documents include (1) D B Holdridge & J D Mulholland (1970), (2) J G Williams et al. (1972), (3) J D Mulholland & P J Shelus (1973), (4) X X Newhall, E M Standish, J G Williams (1983). Since the 1970s, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has produced a series of numerically integrated Development Ephemerides (numbered DExxx), incorporating Lunar Ephemerides (LExxx). Planetary and lunar ephemerides DE200/LE200 were used in the official Astronomical Almanac ephemerides for 1984‚Äì2002, and ephemerides DE405/LE405, of further improved accuracy and precision, have been in use as from the issue for 2003.U S Naval Observatory (2009). Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac. = Analytical developments = In parallel with these developments, a new class of analytical lunar theory has also been developed in recent years, notably the Ephemeride Lunaire ParisienneM Chapront-Touz√©, J Chapront & G Francou (1983, 1988, 2002, 2003) by Jean Chapront and Michelle Chapront-Touz√© from the Bureau des Longitudes. Using computer-assisted algebra, the analytical developments have been taken further than previously could be done by the classical analysts working manually. Also, some of these new analytical theories (like ELP) have been fitted to the numerical ephemerides previously developed at JPL as mentioned above. The main aims of these recent analytical theories, in contrast to the aims of the classical theories of past centuries, have not been to generate improved positional data for current dates; rather, their aims have included the study of further aspects of the motion, such as long- term properties, which may not so easily be apparent from the modern numerical theories themselves.J Chapront & G Francou (2001), and citations therein.

The reef rests on sunken barrier islands\\"Pulley Ridge\\" Coastal and Marine Geology Program. St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center. USGS website Retrieved 27 August 2018. and lies 100 miles west of the Tortugas Ecological Reserve and stretches north about 60 miles at depths ranging from 60‚Äì80 meters. Pulley Ridge was originally discovered in 1950 during a dredging operation conducted by an academic group from Texas. While well known to fishermen, this remarkable habitat remained undiscovered by scientists until 1999 when the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and graduate students from the University of South Florida happened upon it. This reef system, like other mesophotic ecosystems, is inhabited by photosynthesizing corals and algae that are adapted to low-light environments. It is habitat for numerous species of bottom fish including Epinephelus morio (red grouper) spawning area.Allee, R.J., David, A.W., Naar, D.F., 2012. Two Shelf-Edge Marine Protected Areas in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, in: Harris, P.T., Baker, E.K. (Eds.), \\"Seafloor Geomorphology as Benthic Habitat: GEOHAB Atlas of seafloor geomorphic features and benthic habitats.\\" Elsevier, Amsterdam, pp. 435-448. \\"Although deeper-water corals form reefs in the dark of ocean depths, Pulley Ridge is the deepest photosynthetic coral reef that we know of today,\\" said Robert Halley, former US Geological Survey marine geologist.\\" Other reefs lie about 46 meters below sea level. Once established on the seabed, the corals help create hard bottom habitat that becomes home to a diverse community of algae and animals that includes some species that are unique to these communities, and others species that are also found in shallower reef habitats. Understanding the factors that determine where mesophotic reefs are located and distances over which species living within such environments disperse and therefore 'connect' populations are of great interest to marine scientists and resource managers alike. Despite this interest, the deep depths of such reefs hinders both their discovery and their exploration. Coral reefs struggle to survive in the world today. \\"In the past 10 years the world has lost 25% of the known living coral reefs\\". Coral reefs are particularly damaged by \\"‚Ä¶climate change, over fishing and coastal pollution\\". Scientists hope that through the exploration of Pulley Ridge, they can gain new insight of how reefs function in order to better preserve other reefs. The first scientific dives on Pulley Ridge In 2002, the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council through NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Grant Program funded an expedition to examine the habitat and fish fauna on Pulley Ridge. Led by Chief scientist Bob Halley (U.S. Geological Survey, St. Petersburg, FL). Other expeditions have followed, including one led by James K. Culter of the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, Florida and included over 40 team members. The trip went from 23 June through 1 July 2005. The aim of this mission was to collect primary data and biological samples and to document marine life through still photographs and video The expedition was done at depths ranging from 200 to 260 feet. \\"‚Ä¶very few scientific reef investigations are conducted within the depth zone between traditional scuba air limits of 130 feet and deep-sea submersible research at and below 500 feet\\". During these explorations of Pulley Ridge, scientists found bioluminescent bacteria living in the reef that may have some significance to the ridge. Cutler mentioned that compared to a shallow reef, there seemed to be fewer fish. Tilefish and groupers were seen at the ridge. He noted that this could have been because they were scared away by the divers or the fish could only come out at night. There appeared to be fewer crustaceans than one would normally see in a shallow reef, but there were several species of algae present. Back to the Reef: Coral Ecosystem Connectivity: From Pulley Ridge to the Florida Keys In 2011, NOAA funded an ambitious project to fill the knowledge gaps on connectivity between Pulley Ridge and other reef systems throughout the Gulf of Mexico and the Florida Keys. The project involves 35 scientists from 11 different institutions, working on everything from tracking plankton diversity and abundance to studies of the seabed and the use of habitat by economically important fish species. The project focuses on genetic studies to evaluate connectivity among populations of reef species, as well as describing the structure and determining the economic value of Pulley Ridge's mesophotic communities. Results from this study will provide critical information to resource managers so that they can manage and protect shallow and mesophotic coral ecosystems. Mission logs from this project include descriptions of focal species ranging from mesophotic algae to red grouper.

It was on low-lying land, near the Bottesford Beck, about 3 miles (5 km) to the west of the escarpment of the Lincoln Cliff limestone upland, and about the same distance to the east of the River Trent. A preceptory was a community of the Knights Templar who lived on one of that order's estates in the charge of its preceptor. A preceptory also referred to the estate and its buildings. The present Bottesford Manor is believed to have been the gatehouse to the preceptory. Templars Bath, a spring in the field behind Bottesford Manor, is now hardly discernible, being simply a gathering of stones. The bath has been attributed to the Romans but others believe it was a dipping bath or well used by the Templar workers. It was once used as a \\"magic\\" health-giving spring. Travellers would drink its waters and leave cloth offerings (a \\"rag well\\"). This healing property was probably associated with its position near a Templar hospital. The only distinctive Templar artefact found here was an ancient gravestone with a large cross upon it. It was covering a body buried in a grave that had been placed at the angle formed by the north wall of the chancel and the east wall of the north transept, though this description is inconsistent with a normal Templar round church. Archaeologists excavated the Templar fields nearby in 1983, but little was found and the land was back-filled.

Since 2005, Mac computers use the same x86-64 computer architecture as many other desktop PCs, laptops, notebooks and servers, meaning that in principle, the code making up macOS/OS X systems and software can be run on alternative platforms with minimal compatibility issues. Benefits cited for \\"Hackintoshing\\" can include cost (older, cheaper or commodity hardware), ease of repair and piecemeal upgrade, and freedom to use customized choices of components that are not available (or not available together) in the branded Apple products. macOS can also be run on several non- Apple virtualization platforms, although such systems are not usually described as Hackintoshes. Hackintosh laptops are sometimes referred to as \\"Hackbooks\\". In recent years, Hackintosh has started to become widely spread on AMD Processors, hence the term 'Ryzentosh'. The popularity is due to the introduction of the powerful AMD Ryzen and Threadripper CPU's. Apple's software license for macOS only permits the software's use on computers that are \\"Apple-branded.\\" However, because modern Macintosh computers use Intel- based hardware, there are few limitations keeping the software from running on other types of Intel-based PCs. Notably, companies such as Psystar have attempted to release products using macOS on non-Apple machines, though many Hackintosh systems are designed solely by macOS enthusiasts of various hacking forums and communities. While the methods Apple uses to prevent macOS from being installed on non-Apple hardware are protected from commercial circumvention in the United States by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), specific changes to the law regarding the concept of jailbreaking have placed circumvention methods like these into a legal grey area.  History  = OS X Tiger (10.4) = On June 6, 2005, Apple announced its plans to transition to Intel x86 processors at their Worldwide Developers Conference and made available a prototype Intel-based Mac to selected developers at a cost of $999 (). Efforts immediately began to attempt to run Mac OS X on non- Apple hardware, but developers quickly found themselves with an error message saying that the PC hardware configurations were not supported. On January 10, 2006, Apple released 10.4.4 with the first generation of Intel-based Macs, the iMac and the MacBook Pro. These machines used Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) platform firmware instead of the older style BIOS found on most x86 motherboards at the time. On February 14, 2006, an initial \\"hack\\" of v10.4.4 was released on the Internet by a programmer with the pseudonym crg92. Within hours Apple released the 10.4.5 update, which was then hacked by the same author within two weeks. On April 3, 2006 Apple released their 10.4.6 update and again patches were released within two weeks that allowed users to install most of this update on non-Apple computers, although this did not include the updated kernel in 10.4.6. In June 2006, an updated Machbook Proh was released for the 10.4.7 update for non-Apple computers using the 10.4.4 kernel. Up to the release of the 10.4.8 update, all OSx86 patches used the 10.4.4 kernel with the rest of the operating system at version 10.4.8. However, the newer frameworks relied on the newer kernels and this led to users of 10.4.8 encountering many problems. Apple also started making more use of SSE3 instructions on their hardware making it even more difficult for users with CPUs supporting only SSE2 (such as older Pentium 4s) to get a fully compatible system running. To solve this problem, hackers from the community released kernels where those instructions were emulated with SSE2 equivalents, although this produced a performance penalty. Throughout the years, many \\"distros\\" were released for download over the Internet. These distros were copies of the Mac OS X installer disc modified to include additional components necessary to make the OS run on the non-Apple hardware. A prominent member of the community, JaS, released many distros of Mac OS X Tiger containing patched kernels. Some other popular distros are iATKOS, Kalyway, iPC and iDeneb. Distros have fallen out of favour as the OSx86 community grew, as new bootloaders were developed that made it possible to use actual copies of the OS X Installer. = OS X Leopard (10.5) = Mac OS X v10.5 installing on a Lenovo laptop computer. As early as v10.5 build 9A466 the community has maintained a version of Leopard that can run on non-Apple hardware. A hacker by the handle of BrazilMac created one of the earliest patching processes that made it convenient for users to install onto 3rd party hardware by using a legally obtained, retail version of Apple . This simplification made the BrazilMac patch and its later revisions quickly the most popular choice for many distros. Five of the most popular builds go by the name JaS, Kalyway, iATKOS, iPC and iDeneb - although more recently these builds are on the way out as the Boot-132 method (described below) gains popularity. However, all of these compilations rely on the work of kernel hackers made by Lorem (build 9A466), SynthetiX (builds 9A499, 9A527 and 9A559), ToH (builds 9A581, 9B13 and 9B18) and more recently a group calling themselves StageXNU (now called Voodoo) (Darwin 9.4.0). Their contributions trickled down into the various Mac OSx86 installers, readily available on the Internet. They continue to be refined and updated builds released, not just to maintain compatibility with Apple releases but an ever-increasing number of third-party components. The OSx86 community has been quick to make the necessary modifications to enable Apple's latest releases to run on non-Apple hardware. Within hours of Leopard's release, an AMD/Intel SSE2/3 Kernel Patcher was created that removed the HPET requirement from an original untouched mach_kernel file, a core component of the Mac OS. = OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) = When \\"Snow Leopard\\" was released, Russian hacker netkas created a version of Chameleon that can boot Mac OS X v10.6. The main problem was that many people were forced to modify DSDT or use kexts due to some specific issues. As soon as possible modbin and dmitrik released test versions of kernel that allow to boot Snow Leopard on AMD machines. Stable XNU kernels for v10.6 were released by Qoopz and Pcj. There are some popular builds based on Retail by the name Universal (Intel only), Hazard, and iAtkos. Since v10.6.2 Nawcom, Qoopz, and Andy Vandijck have been working on Legacy kernel for unsupported CPUs. = OS X Lion (10.7) = When Apple released the Developer Preview 1, a Russian Hackintosh developer usr-sse2 was the first who created a method to install Lion. The method consists of deploying Mac OS X v10.7 image on a flash drive, and booting from it via XPC UEFI Bootloader (See DUET below). After some changes were made to the Chameleon source code, it became possible to boot Lion with an updated version of Chameleon. After a while Dmitrik also known as Bronzovka had luck with creating a kernel that supported AMD systems; after a few months (10.7.3 V2 With AMD Support) and iAtkos L2 (10.7.2 Only Intel) were released. = OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) = Shortly after the release of Developer Preview 1, some unknown developers managed to install this version of OS X to their PC by using a modified version of the Chameleon Bootloader. This version was released via the main project starting at version r1997 to the general public. Due to the problems sourced during the Lion era, other ways of installing and required patches were never made public, which leaves the scene in an unknown state towards Mountain Lion. Since the retail release of Mountain Lion several users have reported successful setups using installers purchased from the Mac App Store, along with updated versions of Chameleon and other tools including distros. Niresh's Distro (10.8 Intel only) was first released and then was updated to 10.8.2 (With AMD and Intel) and 10.8.5 (With UEFI Support, AMD and Intel Support) versions; iAtkos ML2 was released after Niresh's Release. = OS X Mavericks (10.9) = Multiple new kernels for Hackintosh 10.9 are in the works, although there still are minor issues with most of them. Most of these kernels aim to allow users to run Mavericks on AMD and older Intel CPUs, which lack certain instruction sets of the latest Intel CPUs. Significant efforts have been made to emulate instruction sets like SSSE3, which are not present on AMD K10-based CPUs, and older Intel CPUs, like the Intel Core Duo. AMD's latest CPUs, from the 'Bulldozer' architecture onwards, contain almost all the latest instruction sets, and hence, some kernels with full SSE4 support have also been released. After two months, Niresh's Distro was released for Mavericks, which supports AMD CPUs and latest Intel CPUs. It also has a custom kernel that allows Intel Atom processors to boot into Mavericks. Niresh's was the only free distro that was released for Mavericks, since the iAtkos Team decided to release their Mavericks distro for specific hardware on donation basis. = OS X Yosemite (10.10) = After the initial release of OS X Yosemite 10.10 BETA, various developers took on the role of updating their bootloaders for the system. Members of OSx86 forum Insanelymac set to update the EFI Bootloader Chameleon for this new OS release. Some time later, Niresh (an independent OSx86 developer) released a standalone tool known as Yosemite Zone, which would automatically install the new OS and other various features on a non-Apple device with minimal input. This method consisted of torrenting an OS X 10.10 DMG onto a USB flash drive with MacPwn Vanilla Installation. Unibeast was updated to support Yosemite, and a distribution of Yosemite Zone was released with AMD processor support. A vanilla installation of Yosemite is possible via Insanelymac's Pandora Box Beta 2.0 and UniBeast. This type installation uses as few kexts (drivers) as possible in addition to using an unaltered version of the OS X installation app, and is preferred over distributions. = OS X El Capitan (10.11) = Both Clover and Chameleon were updated to be compatible with El Capitan. Unibeast and MacPwn were updated to support El Capitan as well, since El Capitan, Unibeast (and Multibeast) use the Clover bootloader instead of Chimera (a Chameleon-based bootloader). = macOS Sierra (10.12) = Clover and Chameleon were updated to be compatible with Sierra. UniBeast, Pandora Box and MacPwn were updated to support it and a distribution of Sierra Zone (10.12.3) was released with AMD processor support. = macOS High Sierra (10.13) = Clover, MacPwn , OpenCoreand UniBeast were updated to support it. A distro of High Sierra Zone by Hackintosh Zone (10.13) was released with AMD Processor support including Ryzen CPUs. = macOS Mojave (10.14) = Clover was updated to support Mojave with revision 4514. UniBeast also received Mojave support for Intel-based machines. A distro of Hackintosh Mojave by Hackintosh Zone (10.14) was released. Apple has also discontinued support for NVIDIA Web Drivers from the first release of macOS Mojave, to current. = macOS Catalina (10.15) = Clover r4945 was the first version of Clover to support macOS Catalina, beginning with the first developer beta of macOS Catalina 10.15. UniBeast was updated for macOS Catalina support, but there has not yet been a MultiBeast release for Catalina. For the first public stable release of macOS 10.15, AMD patches were also released, allowing the booting of macOS Catalina on AMD CPU systems. A new bootloader began to emerge during this time, called OpenCore. OpenCore is a successor to Clover, and a necessity for AMD users beyond macOS 10.15.2.. = macOS Big Sur (11.0) = Although macOS Big Sur will still work on Intel processors, Apple had announced that they will be shortly moving to ARM64-based processors, and will eventually stop supporting the Intel64 architecture.https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-announces-mac- transition-to-apple-silicon/  Legal issues and Apple‚Äôs objections  Apple does not authorize the use of Mac OS X on any x86 PC other than those which it has manufactured. After announcing its switch to Intel's chips, the company used technical means (although not the Trusted Platform Module, or TPM, as has been widely misreported), to tie Mac OS to the systems it distributed to developers.\\"DMCA axes sites discussing Mac OS for PCs\\" The macOS EULA forbids installations of macOS on a \\"non-Apple-branded computer\\". On 3 July 2008, Apple filed a lawsuit against Psystar Corporation for violating this restriction, among other claims. Apple claimed Psystar \\"violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by dodging copy-protection technologies Apple uses to protect .\\" Apple employs technological protection measures that effectively control access to Apple's copyrighted works. Specifically, Apple charged Psystar with acquiring or creating code that \\"avoids, bypasses, removes, descrambles, decrypts, deactivates or impairs a technological protection measure without Apple's authority for the purpose of gaining unauthorized access to Apple's copyrighted works.\\" The legal brief revealed that Apple considers the methods that it uses to prevent macOS from being installed on non-Apple hardware to be protected by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). On 13 November 2009, the court granted Apple's motion for summary judgment and found Apple's copyrights were violated as well as the DMCA when Psystar installed Apple's operating system on non-Apple computers. A hearing on remedies was set for 14 December. On 14 January 2009, the Gadget Lab site of Wired Magazine posted a video tutorial for installing on an MSI Wind netbook, but removed it following a complaint from Apple. Textual instructions remain, but include an EULA violation disclaimer. On 15 May 2012, the case Apple vs. Psystar Corporation ended. The court ruled that Psystar had \\"violated Apple's exclusive reproduction right, distribution right, and right to create derivative works,\\" putting an end to the case. Hacking approaches =Kernel hacks= When copies of Mac OS X Tiger started running on non-Apple hardware, it was found that some processors were unable to run the OS. Rosetta, a binary translator that made it possible to run PowerPC programs on Intel processors, (and later the kernel itself) required the support of the SSE3 instruction set. To circumvent this, programmers in the community released patched kernels, which included support for emulating SSE3 instructions using SSE2 equivalents. In October 2005, Apple released update 10.4.3 to developers that required NX bit microprocessor support; however, patches were released to circumvent this as well. Patched kernels were also later released that supported AMD processors. When Mac OS X Leopard released on October 26, 2007, patches were created to remove the HPET requirement from the kernel. Efforts were also made to emulate the SSSE3 instruction set for processors that did not support it. The kernel used by OS X Mavericks made use of SSSE3 instructions, requiring those patches. =Boot loaders and emulators=  EFI emulation  Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. Since emulating the EFI does not generally require copying or modifying macOS, it is considered by some hackers to be the legal way of installing macOS on non-Apple computers (despite being untested in courts). The work started with EFI emulation in the form of David Elliot (dfe)'s modified version of Boot-132 called \\"Darwin/x86\\", which has a \\"FakeEFI\\" system that emulates EFI. In early November 2007, a group of hackers (fronted by a Russian hacker known as Netkas), using Elliot's code, developed a method of emulating an EFI environment using a specially modified Darwin bootloader. In practical terms, this meant that regular PCs meeting a set of hardware requirements could now be \\"seen\\" as real Macintosh computers by the OS, allowing the use of unmodified, \\"stock\\" Apple kernels (as long as the CPU supports it) and thus giving more transparent and reliable operation. Several methods for real world deployment of this innovative solution have arisen around the Internet. An explanation of this achievement along with a usage guide was provided by the website DigitMemo.com. True EFI emulation was a highly sought after asset for the OSx86 community. Previous efforts based upon Apple's open source Darwin Project and Hackintosh gurus allowed users to use macOS on normal PCs, with patched kernels/kernel modules that simply bypassed EFI. Using the EFI patch, a Hackintosh could boot off \\"vanilla\\" (unmodified) macOS kernels and use vanilla kernel extensions. This not only allowed the system to be compatible with future system updates, but also offered increased stability. This method also circumvents one aspect of Apple's End User License Agreement, which states that the modification of non-Open Source components of the OS is forbidden. In mid-2008, a new commercial product, EFi-X, was released that claims to allow full, simple booting off official Leopard install disks, and a subsequent install, without any patching required, but this is possibly a repackaging of Boot-132 technology in a USB-attached device. Rebel EFI is another commercial product that also seems to use Open Source software. It was thought that Windows 7's support of EFI would result in PC motherboards replacing BIOS with EFI. MSI announced the Efinity mainboard in early 2008. As of 2011, EFI-based computers have entered the market, however none can natively boot Mac OS X due to the lack of a HFS+ driver in the EFI implementation.  Boot-132  Boot-132 is a bootloader provided by Apple for loading the XNU kernel. In mid-2008, a new modified BOOT-132 came on to the scene. This method allows users to conduct the Leopard-based OSx86 installation using a stock, retail-purchased copy of Leopard and eradicates the necessity of a hacked installation like JaS or Kalyway (mentioned previously). The Boot-132 bootloader essentially preloads an environment on the system from which Leopard can boot and operate. The bootloader stores the necessary files (kext files) in a .img collection or simply a folder. The luxury of this new installation method includes the ability to boot and install from a retail Leopard DVD and update straight from Apple without breaking the DMCA. The only possible problem here is that it breaks the macOS EULA. The bootloader behaves like the Linux kernel: one can use an mboot-compatible (a patched syslinux was used for the hack) bootloader that tells boot-dfe about the .img file (the ramdisk or initrd, as it's known by Linux users), and boot-dfe will then use the kexts (or mkext) from it. This new boot-dfe has been tested with the retail Leopard DVD, and it can boot, install, run Leopard without having to build a modified DVD.  Chameleon  Since the early developer builds of Mac OS X v10.6, members of the OSx86 community had been booting the new operating system using yet another bootloader called PC EFI provided by Russian hacker Netkas or the bootloader of the Voodoo team's Chameleon. Chameleon is based on David Elliot's Boot-132. The bootloader supports ACPI, SMBIOS, graphics, ethernet, and some other injections. It allows to boot up macOS on non-Macintosh hardware. Chameleon supports a lot of AMD as well as Nvidia graphics cards. There are a lot of forks of it by different developers; the latest version upstream is 2.2 from 2014. Clover Clover is a GUI bootloader for multiple operating systems that supports either UEFI or the legacy BIOS mode. To support booting EFI code, one of the two methods are conventionally taken: either Elliot's FakeEFI was used, or an actual open-source EFI system based on Intel's TianoCore called DUET (Developer's UEFI Emulation) was flashed into the motherboard. However, modern, non-Apple EFI firmware as well as Duet cannot directly load macOS due to various incompatibilities, mainly around the HFS+ file system but also due to the quirks of individual vendors. One more step was needed to load macOS systems: an EFI application to rectify these problems and bridge the gap. Beginning in March 2011, Slice discussed his idea with other community members, resulting in the development of a bootloader that can do both: emulate an EFI firmware of one's choice or use a Real UEFI firmware to boot Mac OS X. It contains EFI applications and drivers for correctly reading an HFS+ disk and patching EFI tables to prepare the system for starting macOS. As of 2020, it is actively maintained.  OpenCore  OpenCore, started in 2019, is another bootloader developed to run macOS on UEFI or BIOS systems as well as old Mac devices that are no longer supported. Compared to Clover, it is said to provide overall better patching and emulation as well as a faster boot time. The project has also taken over the development of some patches, meaning future versions may only work with OpenCore. =Live DVD= In March 2007, the OSx86 community made some significant progress with the development of a Live DVD. The Live DVD allows booting to a working system with Mac OS X v10.4.8. On January 2, 2009, InsanelyMac's Live DVD team published a new method by which a Mac OS X v10.5.x Live DVD could be produced, allowing users to boot a fully working macOS desktop from a DVD or USB flash drive. The method was more reliable than previous methods because it manipulated Apple's existing Netboot and Imageboot functionalities and behaved as if the system were running off a network disk. It was easier to produce; requiring only a single script to be added to an existing installation. Distributions of the live DVD have been made since its inception.

The composer described the work as an \\"eternal spiral\\" because \\"there is neither end nor beginning to the week.\\" Licht consists of 29 hours of music. Origin The Licht opera project, originally titled Hikari (ÂÖâ , Japanese for \\"light\\"), originated with a piece for dancers and Gagaku orchestra commissioned by the National Theatre in Tokyo. Titled Der Jahreslauf (The Course of the Years), this piece became the first act of Dienstag. Another important Japanese influence is from Noh theater, which the composer cites in connection with his conception of stage action . The cycle also draws on elements from the Judeo-Christian and Vedic traditions . The title of Licht owes something to Sri Aurobindo's theory of \\"Agni\\" (the Hindu and Vedic fire deity), developed from two basic premises of nuclear physics, and Stockhausen's conception of the Licht superformula also owes a great deal to Sri Aurobindo's category of the \\"supramental\\" . It is centered on three main characters, Michael, Eve, and Lucifer. Many of the events in the opera refer to The Urantia Book, which was sold to Stockhausen by a remarkable figure during his New York Philharmonic concert in 1971 . In his analysis of the cycle, Gregg Wager states that \\"There can be little doubt ‚Ä¶ that Stockhausen's first and foremost inspiration for Lucifer's rebellion ‚Ä¶ originated from the Urantia Book ‚Ä¶ specific terms such as \\"Local System\\", \\"Planetary Princes\\" or Paradise Sons\\" can only be from the Urantia Book\\" . Wager also points to the fact that Michael is clearly identified in Donnerstag as originating from \\"Nebadon\\", which is another location name peculiar to the Urantia Book . The emblems of Michael and Lucifer in Licht are also derived from the Urantia Book . According to Stockhausen biographer Michael Kurtz, \\"Michael, Lucifer and Eve are, for Stockhausen, more than theatrical figures. They are the expression of a world beyond, to which terrestrial eyes are blind, but which is given concrete form by The Urantia Book and other sources\\" . Wager also takes care to assert that Lucifer, Eve, and Michael are \\"personal inventions of Stockhausen's that were made more meaningful through the Urantia Book. ‚Ä¶ The listener can also assume that Stockhausen has used these symbols freely and enjoys the style of absurdist theater manifested in Originale where no clear meaning is apparent\\" . Furthermore, according to Markus Bandur, the Urantia Book references are concealed by means of associative strategies to other fields of meaning and, as work progressed on Licht after the first-composed opera, Donnerstag, their significance progressively diminishes . The importance of the Urantia Book for Stockhausen's work should not be overestimated . Structure The musical structure of the cycle is based on three counterpointed main melodies (or \\"formulas\\"), each associated with a central character. It follows the method of super-formula composition: these melodies define both the tonal centers and durations of scenes as a whole, as well as the melodic phrasing in detail. Each of the three central characters is also associated with an instrument: Michael with the trumpet, Eve with the basset horn, and Lucifer with the trombone. [See : the Licht superformula] Stockhausen's conception of opera is more akin to the tableaux of the Renaissance masque and its hermetic cosmology than to traditional dramatic and climactic structures typical of the past two centuries . Because of its circular structure, in which the seven days of the week must be passed through again and again, a moral critique is rendered impossible, since the themes of the days perpetually return as permanent features of reality. This in turn reflects Stockhausen's theological outlook, which offers a perspective beyond the superficial differences and opposites that place limitations on thought and hope . Licht is not therefore primarily about the conflict between good and evil, but rather is a drama of latent tensions concerning a dispute about different conceptions of reality . The cycle is constructed modularly. Not only is each of the seven operas a self-sufficient work, but so are the individual acts, scenes, and‚Äîin some cases‚Äîportions of scenes. These modules may be segments (e.g., the eleven instrumental solo sections from Orchester- Finalisten from Mittwoch), or layers (e.g., the electronic Oktophonie layer from the second act of Dienstag or the Klavierst√ºck XIII version of the first scene of Samstag (Luzifers Traum), with the bass voice omitted), or a combination of the two (e.g., the vocal sextet Menschen, h√∂rt and the Bassetsu-Trio, which are two layers of the \\"Karusel\\" subscene from Michaelion, the fourth scene of Mittwoch).  The seven days  There are seven operas, each named for a day of the week, whose subject matter reflects attributes associated in traditional mythologies with each day. These attributes in turn rest on the seven planets of Antiquity (and their associated deities) from which the day-names are derived : * Monday = The Moon * Tuesday = Mars * Wednesday = Mercury * Thursday = Jupiter * Friday = Venus * Saturday = Saturn * Sunday = The Sun Stockhausen sought to fashion the subjects for each opera through absorption in the traditions of this planet and immersion into the intuitive meaning of each day of the week‚Äîmeanings of which most people are not aware . The cycle has neither a \\"beginning\\" nor an \\"ending\\"; like the days of the week, each opera leads to the next one, so that the conflict of Tuesday is followed by the reconciliation of Wednesday, and the mystical union of Sunday prepares the way for the new life of Monday. \\"In this way there is neither end nor beginning to the week. It is an eternal spiral\\" . Each opera is composed from an elaborated form of the corresponding day-segment of the superformula, made by superimposing one or more complete lines from the superformula, compressed to the length of the day-segment. These are named for the day in question (e.g., Mittwoch-Formel.) The separate acts and scenes often involve further superimpositions of formula material. For example, \\"Luzifers Traum\\", the first scene of Samstag, has a total of five layers ( and ). Each day is also assigned a principal (or \\"exoteric\\") colour, as well as one or more secondary (or \\"esoteric\\") colours . = Monday (1984‚Äì1988)= Montag, composed between 1984 and 1988, is dedicated to Eve. It features an orchestra with synthesizers (called a \\"modern orchestra\\" by Stockhausen), backing 21 performers (14 voices, 6 instruments and an actor), as well as adult and children's choirs. The opera is in three acts, framed by a \\"greeting\\" and a \\"farewell.\\" (This framing applies, with variation, to each opera in the cycle: a \\"greeting\\" either in the foyer of the opera house or in the auditorium, and a \\"farewell\\" after the performance, played either in the auditorium or outside the theater.) Monday's exoteric colour is bright green; its esoteric colours are opal and silver . The scenes and subscenes are as follows: * Montags-Gru√ü (Monday's Greeting) * Act 1: Evas Erstgeburt (Eve's First Birth-giving) **scene 1: In Hoffnung (Expecting) **scene 2: Heinzelm√§nnchen **scene 3: Geburts-Arien (Birth Arias) **scene 4: Knaben- Geschrei (Boys' Hullaballoo) **scene 5: Luzifers Zorn (Lucifer's Fury) **scene 6: Das gro√üe Geweine (The Great Weeping) * Act 2: Evas Zweitgeburt (Eve's Second Birth-giving) **scene 1: M√§dchenprozession (Girls' Prozession) **scene 2: Befruchtung mit Klavierst√ºck‚ÄîWiedergeburt (Conception with Piano Piece‚ÄîRebirth) **scene 3: Evas Lied (Eve's Song) * Act 3: Evas Zauber (Eve's Magic) **scene 1: Botschaft (Message) **scene 2: Der Kinderf√§nger (The Pied Piper) [literally, \\"The Child-Catcher\\"] **scene 3: Entf√ºhrung (Abduction) *Montags-Abschied (Monday's Farewell) Photos of Montag aus Licht at La Scala, Milan = Tuesday (1977‚Äì1991) = After having composed the three \\"solo\\" operas (Thursday, Saturday and Monday), Stockhausen proceeded to explore all combinations of the characters. Dienstag is the day of conflict between Michael and Lucifer. After the opening greeting, two acts follow: Jahreslauf (Course of the Years) and Invasion-Explosion mit Abschied (Invasion-Explosion with Farewell). Dienstag is an opera for 17 performers (three solo voices, ten solo instrumentalists, and four dancer-mimes), actors, mimes, choir, a \\"modern orchestra\\" (29 to 32 instruments including synthesizers) and, in the second act, electronic music (titled \\"Oktophonie\\") projected in eight channels, with loudspeakers arranged at the corners of a cube shape around the audience. Since it is a \\"layer,\\" this taped octophonic electronic music may be heard by itself. Tuesday's colour is red . The opera falls into the following sections and subsections: * Dienstags-Gru√ü, Nr. 60 (1987‚Äì88) ** Willkommen ** Friedens- Gru√ü * Act 1: Jahreslauf (Course of the Years), Nr. 47 (1977/1991) * Act 2: Invasion-Explosion mit Abschied (Invasion-Explosion with Farewell), Nr. 61 (1990‚Äì91) ** Erste Luftabwehr (First Air-defense) ** Erste Invasion (First Invasion) ** Zweite Luftabwehr (Second Air-defense) ** Zweite Invasion (Second Invasion) ** Piet√† ** Dritte Invasion (Third Invasion) ** Jenseits (Beyond) ** Synthi-Fou ** Abschied (Farewell) Photos of Dienstag aus Licht at the Leipzig Opera = Wednesday (1992‚Äì1998)= Mittwoch is characterized by the cooperation of Eve, Michael and Lucifer. Composed between 1992 and 1998, the opera consists of four scenes: Welt-Parlament (World Parliament), Orchester- Finalisten (Orchestra Finalists), Helikopter-Streichquartett (Helicopter String Quartet), and Michaelion. The third scene, which has acquired a certain celebrity, is scored, as its name implies, for four stringed instruments and four helicopters, the latter used both as a performatic device and a sound source. The greeting for Mittwoch is the electronic part of scene 4; the farewell is the electronic music from scene 2. The latter, like the electronic music for act 2 of Dienstag, is projected octophonically through speakers arranged at the corners of a cube surrounding the audience. Wednesday's colour is bright yellow . The main divisions and their subdivisions are: * Mittwochs- Gru√ü * Scene 1: Welt-Parlament * Scene 2: Orchester-Finalisten **Oboe **Violoncello **Klarinette **Fagott **Violine **Tuba **Fl√∂te **Posaune **Viola **Trompete **Kontraba√ü **Horn **Orchester-Tutti * Scene 3: Helikopter- Streichquartett (1993) * Scene 4: Michaelion ** Pr√§sidium ** Luzikamel *** Kakabel *** Shoe-Shine Serenade *** Taschen-Trick (Pocket Trick) *** Kamel- Tanz (Camel Dance) *** Stierkampf (Bullfight) ** Operator *** Thinki *** Bassetsu Trio (Karussell) (Carousel) *** \\"Menschen, h√∂rt\\" (Raum-Sextette) (\\"Listen, People\\"‚ÄîSpace-Sextet) * Mittwochs-Abschied = Thursday (1978‚Äì1980) = Donnerstag is an opera for 14 performers (three voices, eight instrumentalists, three dancers) plus a choir, an orchestra, and tapes. Though not the first part of Licht to be started, it was the first opera in the cycle to be completed, having been written between 1978 and 1980. Thursday is the day of the archangel Michael, and the story is centered on this character. It opens in the foyer with a \\"greeting\\" for an ensemble of brass and percussion, followed in the theater by three acts, and ends outside the theater with a \\"farewell\\", played from the surrounding rooftops by five trumpeters. The 16-channel tape composition Unsichtbare Ch√∂re (Invisible Choirs, 1979) is incorporated into act 1, and again into act 3, scene 1 . Stockhausen's Klavierst√ºck XII is an arrangement of act 1, scene 3 , and a number of other segments were arranged by the composer for separate performance. Thursday's exoteric colour is bright blue. It is made up of the following parts: *Donnerstags-Gru√ü (Thursday's Greeting) *Act 1: Michaels Jugend (Michael's Youth; employs Unsichtbare Ch√∂re) **scene 1: Kindheit (Childhood) **scene 2: Mondeva (Moon-Eve) **scene 3: Examen (Examination) ***Erstes Examen (First Examination) ***Zweites Examen (Second Examination) ***Drittes Examen (Third Examination) *Act 2: Michaels Reise um die Erde **Eingang und Formel (Entrance and Formula) **Erste Station (First Station): Germany **Zweite Station (Second Station): New York **Dritte Station (Third Station): Japan **Vierte Station (Fourth Station): Bali **F√ºnfte Station (Fifth Station): India **Sechste Station (Sixth Station): Central Africa **Siebte Station (Seventh Station): Jerusalem **Mission ***Verspottung (Derision) ***Kreuzigung (Crucifixion) ***Himmelfahrt (Ascension) *Act 3: Michaels Heimkehr (Michael's Homecoming) **scene 1: Festival (employs Unsichtbare Ch√∂re) **scene 2: Vision *Donnerstags-Abschied (Thursday's Farewell) Photos of Michaels Reise um die Erde = Friday (1991‚Äì1994) = Freitag, written between 1991 and 1994, portrays Eve's temptation by Lucifer. The whole is divided into two acts, and has a novel structure: apart from the greeting and farewell, it is composed of two layers of scenes: ten \\"real scenes\\" with live performers on stage and twelve \\"sound scenes\\" with electronic transformations of familiar sounds, both performed simultaneously over a third layer of abstract electronic music. It is a complex production headed by five acting musicians (soprano, baritone, bass, flute, basset horn) as well as 12 couples of dancer-mimes, children's orchestra, children's choir, 12 choir singers, synthesizer player, electronic music with sound scenes. Friday's colour is orange . The ten \\"real scenes\\" are: #Antrag (Proposal) #Kinder-Orchester (Children's Orchestra) #Kinder-Chor (Children's Choir) #Kinder-Tutti (Children's Tutti) #Zustimmung (Consent) #Fall #Kinder-Krieg (Children's War) #Reue (Repentance) #Elufa #Chor-Spirale (Choir Spiral) Photo of the scene Kinder-Tutti at the Leipzig Opera = Saturday (1981‚Äì1983) = Samstag is an opera for 13 solo performers (one voice, ten instrumentalists, and two dancers) plus a symphonic band (or symphony orchestra), ballet or mimes, and male choir with organ. It was composed between 1981 and 1983. Saturday is Lucifer's day; its exoteric colour is black . The opera opens with the Samstags Gru√ü for four spatially separated brass ensembles with percussion , which is followed by four scenes: *Samstags- Gru√ü (Saturday's Greeting) *Scene 1: Luzifers Traum (Lucifer's Dream) (Klavierst√ºck XIII), for bass voice and piano *Scene 2: Kathinkas Gesang als Luzifers Requiem (Kathinka's Chant as Lucifer's Requiem), for flute and six percussionists *Scene 3: Luzifers Tanz (Lucifer's Dance), for symphony band (or orchestra), bass voice, solo piccolo, solo piccolo trumpet, solo dancer, stilt-dancer, and dancer-mimes **Linker Augenbrauentanz (Left-Eyebrow Dance) **Rechter Augenbrauentanz (Right-Eyebrow Dance) **Linker Augentanz (Left-Eye Dance) **Rechter Augentanz (Right-Eye Dance) **Linker Backentanz (Left-Cheek Dance) **Rechter Backentanz (Right-Cheek Dance) **Nasenfl√ºgeltanz (Wing-of- the-Nose Dance) **Oberlippentanz (Upper-Lip Dance) ***Protest **Zungenspitzentanz (Tip-of-the-Tongue Dance) **Kinntanz (Chin Dance) *Scene 4: Luzifers Abschied (Lucifer's Farewell), for male choir, seven trombones, and organ Photos of Luzifers Tanz = Sunday (1998‚Äì2003)= Sonntag, written between 1998 and 2003, is centered on the mystical union of Eve and Michael, from which the new life of Monday is produced . It is an opera with five scenes and a farewell. The absence of Lucifer from scene 1 is explained by Stockhausen's description of an accessory scene, called Luziferium, intended to be performed simultaneously with Sonntag, but in a different place, symbolizing the imprisonment of Lucifer, away from Eve and Michael; Luziferium was sketched but never written (; ; ). Scene 4 expands on the multimedia nature of opera‚Äîwith its music, dance, action and scenery‚Äîby involving another human sense: fragrances are released toward the audience. Scene 5 is actually two scenes in one, and consists of two parts: Hoch-Zeiten for five choirs and Hoch-Zeiten for five orchestral groups. (These components are performed simultaneously in two separate auditoriums. At various points acoustical \\"windows\\" are opened, through which the music from the other auditorium is \\"piped in\\" through loudspeakers. The scene is performed twice. After the interval, either the choir and orchestra change halls, or the divided audience does, in order that each group of listeners may experience the scene from both perspectives.) The Farewell is an adaptation for five synthesizers of the choral part of Hoch-Zeiten, and it also exists in two further versions: one for solo percussionist with tape, Strahlen; the other as Klavierst√ºck XIX for synthesizer and tape. The opera falls into the following parts: *Scene 1: Lichter-Wasser (Sonntags-Gru√ü) (Lights-Waters‚ÄîSunday's Greeting), for soprano, tenor, and orchestra with synthesizer *Scene 2: Engel-Prozessionen (Angel- Processions), for seven choral groups *Scene 3: Licht-Bilder (Light-Pictures), for tenor, ring-modulated flute, basset horn, and ring-modulated trumpet *Scene 4: D√ºfte-Zeichen (Scents-Signs), for 7 solo voices, boy soprano, and synthesizer *Scene 5: Hoch-Zeiten (Weddings, but literally: High-Times), for choir and orchestra *Sonntags-Abschied (Sunday's Farewell), for five synthesizers Auxiliary works Apart from the versions of various scenes that can be performed separately, and arrangements of such scenes, there are some pieces that lie outside of the Licht cycle proper, and yet are closely related to it. For example, the Licht superformula itself is adapted as a brief \\"signalling\\" piece: * Licht-Ruf, Nr. 67, for variable ensemble (1995) Other pieces are \\"source\\" compositions, intermediate between the superformula and final compositional elaboration into parts of one of the operas. * Michaels-Ruf, 1. ex Nr. 48¬Ω, for variable ensemble (1978), the unscored basic material for the Donnerstags-Gru√ü * Xi, 1. ex Nr. 55, for a melody instrument with microtones (1986), the \\"seed\\" material for the Montags-Gru√ü Some others are themselves elaborated from such source compositions, but follow a separate line of development: * Traum-Formel, Nr. 51‚Öî, for basset horn (1981), a recomposition of the formula of the first scene of Samstag * Flautina, ex 56¬Ω, for flute with piccolo and alto flute (1989), related to the scene \\"In Hoffnung\\" from the first act of Montag * Quitt, for alto flute, clarinet, and trumpet, Nr. 1 ex 59 (1989), composed out from the basic plan of the Montags- Abschied * Ypsilon, Nr. 2 ex 59, for a melody instrument with microtones (1989), also elaborated from the Montags-Abschied plan * Sukat, Nr. 2 ex 60, for alto flute and basset horn (1989), based on the portion of the Tuesday formula used for the Dienstags-Gru√ü * Vibra-Elufa, Nr. 9¬æ ex 64, for vibraphone (2003), based on the ninth \\"real scene\\" of Freitag (itself used as a source composition for other parts of that opera) * Thinki, Nr. 1 ex 70, for flute (1997), recomposed from material in Michaelion, the final scene of Mittwoch There are four pieces made of versions of the formula for Mittwoch: * Europa-Gruss, Nr. 72, for winds (1992/1995/2002), originally conceived as the \\"greeting\\" for Mittwoch but replaced * Trumpetent, Nr. 73, for four trumpets (1995) * Mittwoch-Formel, Nr. 73¬Ω, for percussion trio (2004) * Klavierst√ºck XVIII (Mittwoch-Formel), Nr. 73‚Öî, for synthesizer (2004) Also, there is * Strahlen, Nr. 80¬Ω, for a percussionist and ten-channel sound recording (2002), fashioned from Hoch-Zeiten for choir Finally, there is: * Litanei 97, Nr. 74, for choir and singing conductor (1997) which sets a text from Aus den sieben Tagen (1968), incorporating fragments of the Licht superformula.  Performances  Work on Licht began in 1977, and was finished in 2003, though the final scene was performed for the first time in 2004. All seven operas have been staged individually, at La Scala (Thursday, Saturday, and Monday), Covent Garden (Thursday), Leipzig Opera (Tuesday and Friday), Cologne Opera (Sunday), and Birmingham Opera Company (Wednesday, premiered on the composer's birthday, 22 August 2012). Plans had previously been made to stage Wednesday in Bonn in 2000 and in Bern in 2003, but both were canceled due to financial and technical problems. The entire cycle was broadcast in a series on SWR2 between 2001 and 2007, introduced by the composer in conversation with Reinhard Ermen. Performing such a piece is a challenge not only due to its length, but also due to the logistics involved. Each part, and in many cases, each scene, is designed for a different configuration of musicians, ranging from scenes written for a cappella choir to orchestra with synthesizer to string quartet playing from helicopters above the concert hall. In 2019 the Dutch National Opera initiated a three-day immersion into Licht that was called aus LICHT. It included portions of the Licht cycle from all seven days, totaling about 15 hours of performance time. The three days/parts were: * Michael * Lucifer and Eve * Cooperation and the Opening Up of Space Performance dates were May 31 ‚Äì June 2, June 4‚Äì6, and June 8‚Äì10. aus LICHT was a joint production of the Dutch National Opera, Holland Festival, Royal Conservatory of The Hague, and the Stockhausen Foundation for Music .

Life He was son of the Holstein minister at Stockholm, Johan Pechlin, and brother of Johanna Lohm. After moving to Sweden at age six, he was educated in Sweden, and entered the Swedish army. He rose to the rank of major-general, but became famous by being the type par excellence of the corrupt and egoistic Swedish parliamentarian of the final period of the Age of Liberty; he received for many years the sobriquet of 'General of the Riksdag'. Pechlin first appears prominently in Swedish politics in 1760, when by suddenly changing sides he contrived to save the Hats from impeachment. Enraged at being thus excluded from power by their former friend, the Caps procured Pechlin's expulsion from the two following Riksdags. In 1769 Pechlin sold the Hats as he had formerly sold the Caps, and was largely instrumental in preventing the projected indispensable reform of the Swedish constitution. During the revolution of 1772 he escaped from Stockholm and kept quietly in the background. In 1786, when the opposition against Gustavus III was gathering strength, Pechlin reappeared in the Riksdag as one of the leaders of the malcontents, and is said to have been at the same time in the pay of the Russian court. In 1789 he was one of the deputies whom Gustavus III kept under lock and key until he had changed the government into a semi-absolute monarchy. It is fairly certain that Pechlin was behind the plot for murdering Gustavus in 1792. On the eve of the assassination (16 March) the principal conspirators met at his house to make their final preparations and discuss the form of government which should be adopted after the king's death. Pechlin undertook to crowd the fatal masquerade with accomplices, but took care not to be there personally. He was arrested on 23 March but nothing definite could ever be proved against him. Nevertheless, he was condemned to imprisonment in the fortress of Varberg, where he died four years later.

At the conclusion of the latter campaign, Kirkham stayed in the country and became the main Western advisor to Emperor Yohannes IV. He was instrumental in training Ethiopian troops to Western military standards, raising and drilling what became known as the Emperor's Disciplined Force. Kirkham's troops played a major role in the defeat of the 1871 invasion of Tigray by Yohannes's rival for the Ethiopian crown, Emperor Tekle Giyorgis II (Wagshum Gobeze), fighting with conspicuous success in the Battle of Adwa on 11 July. Thereafter Kirkham was sent by Yohannes on a diplomatic mission to Europe to help attract recognition and support for his imperial regime. He visited London and possibly also Paris and Vienna on the Emperor's behalf, returning via Massawa in February 1873. In recognition of Kirkham's abilities and services, Yohannes promoted his advisor ‚Äì who had once kept a hotel at Tientsin and had arrived in the country as a ship's steward with the P&O; Line ‚Äì to the rank of general and gave him a substantial estate at Asmara, then in the province of Tigray, and near the Egyptian frontier. Kirkham was later made governor of that province. Kirkham's men fought again during the invasion of Ethiopia by Egypt that began in October 1875. They played a part in an initial skirmish at Kesad-Ikka, but Kirkham was late arriving at the critical Battle of Gundet next day (16 November 1875). This battle saw the decisive defeat of the Egyptian army commanded by the Danish adventurer Colonel Arrendrup by Yohannes's general Ras Alula Engida. Kirkham's failure to reach the battle site in time to take part in the fighting cost him much of his prestige, some Ethiopian officers describing him as \\"an old woman\\" for his dilatoriness. Sent on a second mission to Europe in December 1875, Kirkham was captured attempting to cross Egyptian lines and was sent to Massawa, where he was kept imprisoned in a large cage normally used to hold lions. His captors gave him little or no food, but copious amounts of alcohol to drink, with the intention that he be \\"compelled to feed upon the insects on his body.\\" Kirkham was discovered in his cage by a party of British sailors landed from the gunboat HMS Teazer, one of whom described him as ragged, half-naked and starving. The sailors wished to free him, but upon enquiry via cable to London, the naval party was informed that Kirkham had sacrificed the right to British protection by taking service with Yohannes. He was left in his cage. Kirkham eventually developed delirium tremens as a result of his treatment by the Egyptians and was taken to the Lutheran mission in Massawa for treatment. He died there, of alcohol poisoning and dysentery, in the middle of June 1876, six months after his capture. Kirkham's military abilities were praised by Gordon, who described him as \\"an officer (there being but few others) in whom I could place implicit trust.\\" He was, however, wounded twice, severely, in the head during the latter stages of the Taiping Rebellion, after which his personality and military capacity are said to have changed sharply for the worst. Kirkham was visited, at his home in Ethiopia, by Dermot Bourke, the Earl of Mayo, in January 1875. Bourke described him as \\"a fair, rather good-looking, slim man\\" who was shabbily dressed in \\"an undress general's uniform with a large sword clanking by his side\\" and thin old button boots \\"which were rather trying to his poor feet on the rocks.\\" A few months later, after his capture, Kirkham was seen by the former Confederate General William Loring, who had taken service with the Egyptians, and described as \\"utterly used up by disease and dissipation\\", wearing an ancient and much-patched British military uniform, and being very indignant that his nationality and British passport were being ignored.

He was the nephew of Pierre-Oscar Figuier and became Professor of chemistry at L'Ecole de pharmacie of Montpellier. Though his works are highly respected, it is often unmentioned that he was in fact a staunch racist of the time (see The Human Race). Figuier played a key role in perpetuating the blatantly myopic misconception that people of black origin were mentally inferior, were not fully human, smelled poorly, and were promiscuous. His citing of these ill-formed concepts of course were and are not true yet he remains celebrated in his achievements. Louis Figuier was married to French writer Louise Juliette Bouscaren. Career Figuier became Doctor of Medicine (1841), agr√©g√© of pharmacology, chemistry (1844‚Äì1853) and physics and gained his PhD in (1850). Figuier was appointed professor at L'Ecole de Pharmacie of Paris after leaving Montpellier. In his research he found himself opposed to Claude Bernard; as a result of this conflict, he abandoned his research to devote himself to popular science. He edited and published a yearbook from 1857 to 1894 ‚Äì L'Ann√©e scientifique et industrielle (or Expos√© annuel des travaux) ‚Äì in which he compiled an inventory of the scientific discoveries of the year (it was continued after his death until 1914).

In 2001 it had a population of 6,045,Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Fylde Retrieved 2009-09-18 reducing to 6,019 at the 2011 Census. The village is near Warton, with its links to BAE Systems. Warton Aerodrome's runway is partly within Freckleton's boundary. Freckleton has a parish council, and is part of Fylde Borough, and Fylde constituency. History The name of the village appears in the Domesday Book as \\"Frecheltun\\" and is said to derive from 'Farmstead of a man called Frecla', with Old English tun and Nordic personal name.Mills, Anthony David (2003); A Dictionary of British Place Names, p. 195, Oxford University Press, revised edition (2011). It was one of 62 settlements to be found in the Hundred of \\"Agemvndrenesse\\" (Amounderness). Another suggested derivation is from the Anglo-Saxon word for \\"lusty\\" or \\"argumentative\\".Bevan, E. M. and Ramsbottom, M. (1994), A Walk Round Old Freckleton, Hedgehog Historical Publications, . Freckleton supplied water to the Roman fort at Kirkham, and in the 19th century was a port for the ship building industry.Shakeshaft, P. 2001, The History of Freckleton, Carnegie Publishing, p. 208 Rope and sailcloth, for the early boatbuilding industry, was made in the village for many years. Balderstone Mill, erected in 1880, was the first organised factory system in the village, its weaving shed had 320 looms, and the cloth it produced sold on the Manchester Cotton Exchange. The mills closed in 1980. There was a water-mill, situated on the Dow Brook, from at least as early as 1427, when it was in the possession of a William Hodelliston. It was sold for the sum of ¬£350, in 1882, with the sole purpose of its decommission, to allow the marsh to be more effectively drained.Walker, R. (1942), \\"Freckleton Water Mill\\" in TRANSACTIONS OF THE HISTORIC SOCIETY OF LANCASHIRE AND CHESHIRE FOR THE YEAR 1942, VOL. XCIV, pp.94-110. Read to the Society on 30 May 1942: The Quaker burial ground at Quaker's Wood, also known as \\"Twill Furlong\\", in Lower Lane, between Freckleton and Kirkham, has a single gravestone. Until the 1920s, Freckleton had a tollgate and travelers to Lytham and Preston had to pay a toll to use the turnpike road. The toll was collected at toll house bridge. The toll could be avoided by crossing the Dow brook and walking along the bridle way. In World War II, American forces from the neighbouring Warton Aerodrome resided in the village. The Freckleton Air Disaster occurred on 23 August 1944, when an aircraft attempting to land at Warton during stormy weather crashed onto Freckleton's Holy Trinity School. Sixty-one people lost their lives, including thirty-eight infants, their two teachers, and the three air crew. Other victims included several residents and US personnel in a snack bar across the road from the school. Annual commemorations still take place, attended by residents and US veterans.Shakeshaft, P. 2001, The History of Freckleton, Carnegie Publishing, p.245 The aerodrome was subsequently purchased by English Electric, now BAE Systems, and many BAE employees live in the village. The area around the village War Memorial, now protected by railings, was once the village green, where stood the smithy and toll house. Landmarks The village is the home of Holy Trinity Church of England parish church which was founded in 1837 and of Freckleton Methodist Church which was founded in 1810. The family butcher Snape, on Kirkham Road, was established in 1864. Freckleton Library was opened in 1980 by Sir Edward Gardner, MP for Fylde South. It replaced the mobile library which used the same site.Freckleton LibraryHistory of Freckleton Before the new library opened, the public library was situated on Lytham Road.

Life and work From 1778 to 1788 he was educated at the Hohe Karlsschule in Stuttgart where he trained as a painter. He then attended the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts (1789‚Äì1790) in Paris and studied architecture in Rome (1791‚Äì1797). After returning to Stuttgart, he worked for the court in W√ºrttemberg as a designer-draughtsman and decorative painter. An early architectural project was the Gothic Revival church of Hohenheim (1797; re-erected 1803 at Monrepos, Ludwigsburg; ruin since the 1940s. With the assistance of Goethe, whom he met in Stuttgart in 1797, Thouret was commissioned to design the d√©cor of the Schloss in Weimar and to renovate the court theatre there (1798‚Äì1800). On his return to Stuttgart, Thouret was appointed court architect to Frederick II, Duke of W√ºrttemberg (1754‚Äì1816), in 1799. He undertook numerous building projects, nearly all in the Neo-classical style, in Stuttgart and Ludwigsburg where the dukes had their official residences; these schemes took account of the increasing need for prestigious buildings in W√ºrttemberg, following its elevation in 1806 to the Status of a kingdom, with the Duke becoming its first king. As well as renovations to the royal palaces, designs for park furniture and ephemeral festival constructions, several theatre projects were entrusted to Thouret, and he also produced furniture designs for the interior decoration of the palaces. In addition to his work for the Court, Thouret designed many private buildings, especially in Stuttgart (e.g., Wohnhaus Erbe, K√∂nigstrasse, 1806; Wohnhaus Kohl, Friedrichstrasse, 1817). After the death of the King in 1816, Thouret was dismissed in 1817 from his post as court architect. He was appointed Professor of architecture, but because of delays in the proposed establishment of a professional academy his potential as a teacher of architecture was never developed. Instead he continued to be given design commissions and was involved in almost all the foremost architectural projects undertaken in Stuttgart to the 1830s (e.g., Katharinenhospital, 1827; Hoftheater, 1833). Among the few Works by Thouret that have been preserved are his schemes for the interior decoration of Weimar Palace (begun 1789) and Ludwigsburg Palace (begun 1805), the theatre (1812) at Ludwigsburg Palace, the assembly hall and pump room (begun 1825) in Bad Cannstatt and the Eberhard baths (begun 1838) in Wildbad.

She had a gun forward and 20 mm Oerlikon machine guns on the wings of the bridge, which could be used for anti-aircraft and anti-ship actions. She was also equipped with ASDIC anti-submarine sonar detection equipment, and carried up to 14 depth charges. Later on, she was equipped with a Holman Projector. A crest of the Hailsham Family was given to the ship in 1942 at the request of First Lieutenant Reginald Mortimore, and was displayed on the front of the ship's bridge. The ship saw action in the English Channel, and the Eastern Atlantic. Fate Lord Hailsham was on convoy duty when she was sunk on 27 February 1943 in Lyme Bay by German E-boats. At the time she was one of five armed ships, led by the Hunt Class destroyer HMS Blencathra, escorting a convoy of eight merchant vessels from South Wales to Southampton.

It was designed to provide comfort seating and shelter from wind, rain, sand gusts and sunburn on beach seafront resorts frequented by tourists. Other built-in details, like extendable footrests, sun awning, side folding tables and storage space, provide the user with several comforts. Strandk√∂rbe are found at nearly all beach seafront resorts of the North Sea and Baltic Sea in Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, as well as other beach seafronts where sudden fluctuations in adverse weather conditions and wind gusts can prevail. The Strandkorb beach-chair is considered a cult object of German Gem√ºtlichkeit, which has survived two world wars, social and industrial revolutions and the East-West divide of Germany. From spring to autumn, they can usually be rented from beach-chair wardens (German Strandkorbw√§rter). Two different shapes can be distinguished, the straight angular North Sea variety and the round rolling Baltic Sea variety. Origin The \\"Strandkorb\\" beach-chair was invented in 1882 by German basket maker Wilhelm Bartelmann in Rostock, originally for his customer Elfriede Maltzahn, who suffered from rheumatism and had requested in his workshop a \\"seating accommodation for the beach that would provide shelter from the sun and wind\\". Bartelmann's family were basket makers from L√ºbeck. At age 25, Wilhelm opened his own basket weaving workshop in Rostock, where he also became court appointed basket-maker to the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Bartelmann's \\"beach-chair\\" caused such great sensation among other beach- visitors, who also wanted to sit comfortably at the beach, that demand for his \\"Strandkorb\\" soared. In 1883, Bartelmann's wife Elisabeth, opened the first \\"Strandkorb\\" rental service near Warnem√ºnde Lighthouse in Warnem√ºnde. The first prototype models were single seaters and appeared quickly on other parts of the German coast, a year later Bartelmann also developed a two-seater version. Since about 1910, the standard Strandkorb beach-chair model, is a two-seater, its design and construction has changed little since. Thomas Mann refers to Strandkorbs (using the words Strandkorb and Sitzkorb) in his 1901 novel Buddenbrooks, anachronistically setting the context in the 1840s on the beach at Travem√ºnde. History The manufacture of wicker-armchair furniture with covered high-rising hoods have been known and handed down in the European basket makers craft-work since the late 16th-century. The furniture was used mainly for large cold rooms and draughty indoor settings. Its use is known in both town and farm houses in the Netherlands and Germany, in the 18th-century such seating furniture were also found in palaces in England, Scotland and Ireland. Special designs 2007 G8 summit in Heiligendamm, Mecklenburg When the 2007 G8 summit in Heiligendamm met in June 2007, the Marketing Department of the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern provided a special beach chair manufactured specifically for the leaders of the eight participating states and the President of the European Commission to use for a final photo. These photographs taken on June 8, 2007 have gained some international notoriety. The beach chair is a good two meters high and almost six meters long. It was produced by the traditional Korb GmbH of Heringsdorf on the Baltic island of Usedom. All employees of the company were involved in the production of the chair, which lasted three weeks. It needed two kilometres of interlace, a cubic meter of timber, sourced from domestic pine, and 35 square meters blue and white cloth. The sun awning was printed with the respective country flags. After the event the beach chair was transported to different locations over some months as an item of interest for tourists and locals. Among other things, it was displayed in Berlin in front of the Chancellor's Office, at the Brandenburg Gate, and the day of German unity on October 3, 2007 in Schwerin. In November 2007 the beach chair was auctioned off in aid of the charity Ein Herz f√ºr Kinder ('A heart for children'). The founder of the Deutsche Verm√∂gensberatung AG (DVAG), Reinfried Pohl, purchased it for the price of one million Euros. Since 2008 it is used for further fund-raising.

They were externally featureless save for the needed mekugi-anaHoles in the hilt, meant for the mekugi (pegs) that secure the blade (See katana). to secure the nakago (tang), though sometimes sayagaki (blade information) was also present. The need for specialized storage is because prolonged koshirae mounting harmed the blade, owing to factors such as the lacquered wood retaining moisture and encouraging corrosion. Such mountings are not intended for actual combat, as the lack of a tsuba (guard) and proper handle wrappings were deleterious; as such they would likely never make their way onto a battlefield. However, there have been loosely similar \\"hidden\\" mountings, such as the shikomizue. Also, many blades dating back to earlier Japanese history are today sold in such a format, along with modern-day reproductions; while most are purely decorative replicas, a few have functional blades.Most manufacturers will note that such mountings are only meant for storage, display and transport purposes, not actual usage. = Shirasaya gallery = File:Saya-bois.jpgA typical shirasaya with sayagaki (attribution or appraisal written on a shirasaya) File:Naginata shirasaya.jpgNaginata shirasaya File:Yari tanto shirasaya.JPGTanto shirasaya File:Wakizashi 2.JPGWakizashi mounted in shirasaya File:Yari shirasaya.JPGYari shirasaya  Koshirae  The word koshirae is derived from the verb , which is no longer used in current speech.

A koshirae should be presented with the tsuka (hilt) to the left, particularly in times of peace with the reason being that you cannot unsheathe the sword easily this way. During the Edo period, many formalized rules were put into place: in times of war the hilt should be presented to the right allowing the sword to be readily unsheathed. Koshirae were meant not only for functional but also for aesthetic purposes, often using a family mon (crest) for identification. = Types of koshirae = Tachi The tachi style koshirae is the primary style of mounting used for the tachi, where the sword is suspended edge-down from two hangers (ashi) attached to the obi. Art of the samurai: Japanese arms and armor, 1156‚Äì1868, Authors Morihiro Ogawa, Kazutoshi Harada, Publisher Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2009, , P.193 The hilt often had a slightly stronger curvature than the blade, continuing the classic tachi increase in curvature going from the tip to the hilt. The hilt was usually secured with two pegs (mekugi), as compared to one peg for shorter blades including uchigatana and katana. The tachi style koshirae preceded the uchigatana (katana) style koshirae. Uchigatana (katana) The uchigatana style koshirae is the most commonly known koshirae and it is what is most associated with a samurai sword. Swords mounted in this manner are worn with the cutting edge up as opposed to the tachi mounting, in which the sword is worn with the cutting edge down. Han-dachi (half tachi) The han-dachi koshirae was worn katana-style but included some tachi related fittings such as a kabuto- gane instead of a kashira.

The saya of a koshirae (scabbards for practical use) are normally manufactured from very lightweight wood, with a coat of lacquer on the exterior. The wood is light enough that great care must be taken when drawing the sword; incorrect form may result in the blade of the sword slicing through the saya and injuring one or more fingers. Correct drawing and sheathing of the blade involves contacting the mune (the back of the blade) rather than ha (the edge) to the inside of the scabbard.

There are a number of different methods for wrapping and tying the sageo on the saya for display purposes. Other uses for the sageo are tying the sword to the samurai and hojojutsu. The samurai felt the sageo formed a spiritual bond between them and the sword, and they were very particular about tying it correctly when the sword was not in use.

The tsuba was mostly meant to be used to prevent the hand from sliding onto the blade during thrusts as opposed to protecting from an opponent's blade. The chudan no kamae guard is determined by the tsuba and the curvature of the blade. The diameter of the average katana tsuba is , wakizashi tsuba is , and tant≈ç tsuba is . During the Muromachi period (1333‚Äì1573) and the Momoyama period (1573‚Äì1603) Tsuba were more for functionality than for decoration, being made of stronger metals and designs. During the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868) there was peace in Japan so tsuba became more ornamental and made of less practical metals such as gold. Tsuba are usually finely decorated, and nowadays are collectors' items. Tsuba were made by whole dynasties of craftsmen whose only craft was making tsuba. They were usually lavishly decorated. In addition to being collectors items, they were often used as heirlooms, passed from one generation to the next. Japanese families with samurai roots sometimes have their family crest (mon) crafted onto a tsuba. Tsuba can be found in a variety of metals and alloys, including iron, steel, brass, copper and shakud≈ç. In a duel, two participants may lock their katana together at the point of the tsuba and push, trying to gain a better position from which to strike the other down. This is known as tsubazeriai (ÈçîËø´„ÇäÂêà„ÅÑ), lit. pushing tsuba against each other. Tsubazeriai is a common sight in modern kend≈ç. In modern Japanese, tsubazeriai (ÈçîËø´„ÇäÂêà„ÅÑ) has also come to mean \\"to be in fierce competition.\\" File:Fuchi, tsuba and tsuka-ito.JPGKatana tsuba File:Tsuba, fuchi, and tsuka-ito.jpgKatana tsuba File:Japanese - Tsuba with a Frog in a Lotus Pond - Walters 51177 - Back.jpgLotus pond File:Shakudo Tsuba.jpg Shakudo tsuba - Chidori in flight.

It has the double purpose of locking the tsuba (guard) in place, and to maintain the weapon in its saya (scabbard). The importance of the habaki is seen in drawing the katana from the scabbard. It is drawn by grasping the scabbard near the top and pressing the guard with the thumb to emerge the blade just enough to unwedge the habaki from inside the scabbard in a process called . The blade, being freed, can be drawn out very quickly. This is known as , , or . This is obviously an extremely aggressive gesture, since a fatal cut can be given in a fraction of a second thereafter (see iaid≈ç). It is similar in connotation and effect as drawing back the hammer of a handgun, chambering a round on a pump-action shotgun, or pulling back and releasing the charging handle on other firearms. The expression \\"tanka o kiru\\" is now widely used in Japan, in the sense of \\"getting ready to begin something\\", or \\"getting ready to speak\\", especially with an aggressive connotation. The habaki will cause normal wear and tear inside the scabbard, and either a shim or a total replacement of the scabbard may be needed to remedy the issue as it will become too loose over time. Removing the habaki and oiling it after cutting or once every few months is recommended.

Moesia was first established as a separate province in 45‚Äì46 AD. History Little is known about them prior to 29 BC. During the \\"Wars of Augustus\\" the Romans under Crassus chased an army of the Bastarnae and marched towards the Moesi, successfully overtaking their stronghold and subduing the majority of the tribe by 29 BC. The large number of davae (town names end in '-dava' or '-deva') across Moesia, parts of Thrace and Dalmatia, indicates a much closer linguistic affinity between Dacian and Moesian languages, than between Moesian and Thracian, hinting to a much closer connection between Dacians and Moesians. The distinctly Thracian -para and -bria endings for town names are mostly present south of Moesia, making the Balkan Mountains (Haemus Mons) the linguistic border between Daco-Moesian and Thracian languages and cultures. However, it is also possible that '-dava' and '-bria' mean two different things in the same language, rather than meaning the same thing in two different languages. Thus bria could have been used for urbanized settlements, similar in scale and design to those of the \\"civilised\\" peoples like Greeks and Romans, whereas '-dava' could mean a settlement which is rural, being situated in the steppe-like part of the Thracian lands. The close Dacian-Moesian connection is somewhat emphasized by the fact that significant areas of Moesia were part of Burebista's Dacian kingdom formed by creating a union of related Geto-Dacian, Moesian and Thracian tribes. Additionally, after the Roman conquest of Moesia, the Geto-Dacians constantly raided across the Danube, under kings like Duras and Diurpaneus, harassing Roman troops. And yet, the same lands were more easily acquired, and held for a much longer period of time, by the Odrysian Kingdom, a Thracian state. From the Moesian language or dialect, only a few items are recorded; their ethnonym (Moesoi, Moesi), some toponyms and anthroponyms, and a phytonym: Mendruta, the Moesian name for the False helleborine (L. Veratrum nigrum) or the Beet (L. Beta vulgaris).

The weapon was proposed and designed by Holmans, a machine tool manufacturer based at Camborne, Cornwall. A number of models were produced during the war years, but all worked on the principle of a pneumatic mortar, using compressed air or high pressure steam to fire an explosive projectile at enemy aircraft.Lambert et al., 1990, p191 Intended primarily as a stop-gap defensive weapon for British merchant ships, which had been suffering heavy losses from Luftwaffe aircraft flying anti-shipping missions, the low altitude at which such strikes often took place (such as during torpedo attacks by Heinkel He 111's or skip- bombing attacks by Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor) meant that a weapon of such limited range and velocity could throw up an effective screen of fire over a vessel, even if only to create a distracting or deterrent effect, obliging the enemy to bomb from greater heights which reduced bombing accuracy. While ineffective against normal bombing attacks from higher altitudes, the weapon was far cheaper, easier to build and install in great numbers than conventional anti-aircraft artillery. Holmans specialised in producing gas compressors and pneumatic equipment and its owner, Treve Holman, conceived a way that his firm could aid in the war effort beyond the production of tools. Recalling the World War I-era Stokes Mortar and its successor, the Ordnance ML 3 inch Mortar, Holman believed that it would be possible to produce a version powered by compressed air. Preliminary tests showed that the idea was feasible, with an early prototype throwing an eighteen-pound steel weight nearly . Mk I The design eventually settled on for the Mk I featured a 4¬Ω foot unrifled steel barrel. Rounds were dropped down the barrel from the muzzle, and the pneumatic system triggered instantly upon the round striking the base. The rounds themselves were made from an open-topped metal container, holding a Mills bomb fitted with a 3.5 second fuse. High-pressure air bottles were able to supply enough power to fire fifty rounds each, with a maximum height during trials of around . The rate of fire could reach thirty rounds per minute in the hands of an experienced crew. More appealing yet to the armed forces was the fact that the weapon could be produced using only cast iron and mild steel, both of which were in fairly ready supply at this stage of the war. An official trial of the Mk I Projector took place in February, 1940 with resounding success. An order was placed by the Royal Navy for 1000 of the Mk I models, and the weapons proved just as successful in action; the first confirmed success reported only three weeks after the initial batch were sent out when a Heinkel aircraft was damaged. While direct hits were rare, the bombs fired by the projector displayed an unexpected property -- the explosion would leave a large puff of black smoke, absent from ground-based explosions from similar grenades. Firing a large number in quick succession gave the impression to incoming Luftwaffe pilots that the target vessel was armed with something far more deadly than the Holman Projector, deterring or disrupting attacks, or convincing the aircraft's crew an attack at greater range would be prudent, with a commensurate decrease in accuracy. Mk II The Mk II Projector was developed after a request from the Royal Navy for a version that could be fired using steam in place of compressed air, since the steam-engined trawlers (both fishing and minesweeping) had the former in plentiful supply. The Stokes design of the Mk I needed to be abandoned for this, since the harsh weather experienced by the trawlers invariably rusted the valves of the pneumatics. When steam was used in such a system, the water would condense in the pipes and prevent firing of the weapon. To solve this, a firing trigger was added, in place of the Stokes design in which the round would be fired automatically. The new version was fitted to a wide variety of ships, from destroyers to minesweepers and motor gun boats: to demonstrate the weapon's versatility, a trial was arranged in Aldershot, Hampshire before Prime Minister Winston Churchill. No Mills rounds were brought, as it was assumed that some form of ammunition would be provided by the British Army, who were overseeing the trials but these were overlooked and the trial was set to be delayed until one officer thought to bring out the bottles of beer that were to have been served at lunch: the smooth bore of the Projector allowed even these irregular projectiles to be fired successfully, with all striking the target with an explosion of glass and foam. The Prime Minister commented on the weapon afterwards, describing it as \\"A very good idea, this weapon of yours. It will save our cordite\\". (This was prophetic: while possibly apocryphal stories of projectors mounted on trawlers being used to fire 'spuds' (potatoes) at low-flying German aircraft for the want of Mills bombs led to the nickname 'potato thrower'. 'spud gun' etc.) Regardless of the successful trial results the Mk II proved to be highly inaccurate when fired at distant moving targets: only a dozen or so aircraft were confirmed to have been downed by the weapon in its first year of service but it succeeded in convincing many more aircraft that the target vessel was more heavily equipped with more effective weapons, confirmed by the large number of reports were made about Luftwaffe aircraft turning away from an attack after salvos from ship-mounted Holman Projectors. Within the Admiralty, the perception was that the Projector was a useful stop-gap weapon in the early years of the war, when other more effective anti aircraft weaponry, such as the Oerlikon 20 mm cannon, were in short supply. Mk III In 1941, production of the Mk III Holman Projector began. This version was semi-automatic, and capable of firing multiple projectiles in a single salvo to a height of around . The Admiralty placed an order for a further one thousand units, to be fitted to coastal gunboats and other light craft, where the light recoil of the weapon had proven useful. Plans were drawn up for a Mk IV version of the Projector to fill this niche more readily, with a shorter barrel and swivel base but when these were ready the war had progressed, more advanced weaponry was available and that made the Projector obsolete. A number of the earlier model Projectors remained in service and discouraged attacks in the Mediterranean by some smaller submarines, and a small number were adapted to fire grapnels for commando cliff assaults. In total around 4,500 Holman Projectors were put into active service during World War II, and several can still be found in museums in the United Kingdom. Effectiveness While Holman Projector had limited success with one cargo ship's crew shooting down two airplanes, it became better known for its other uses. Since it had a wide barrel, the projector could shoot nearly anything that could fit inside it; the most popular makeshift ammunition was potatoes.How the Humble Potato Cannon Served the Allies in World War Two Popular Mechanics, Retrieved April 4, 2017.

Produced with various modifications such as greater caliber, longer barrel and adjustable sighting device, it was an improved although unlicensed copy of its predecessor, and was the standard machine gun of the Polish Army since 1931.Erenfeicht, Leszek (2013). Ckm wz.1930 Design and development After Poland regained her independence in 1918, her armed forces were armed with a variety of different weapons, mostly a legacy of the armies of her former occupying powers. As with their rifles and carbines, the machine guns used by the Polish Army in the Polish-Soviet War included Russian 7.62 mm M1910 Maxim, Austrian 1907 8 mm Schwarzlose MG M.07/12, German 7.9 mm Maschinengewehr 08 and French 8 mm Hotchkiss Mle 1914. Such diversity was a logistical nightmare, and in the early 1920s the General Staff of the Polish Army decided to replace all older machine guns with a new design, specifically built to Polish designations.Leszek Erenfeicht, CKM Browning wz.30 ‚Äì Klon lepszy od orygina≈Çu (\\"Clone better than original\\") (in Polish) Magnum-X.pl, 2008; reprint. Retrieved Initially the Hotchkiss machine gun, proven during the Polish-Soviet War, and adapted to the standard Polish 7.92 mm round (as the Ckm wz.25 Hotchkiss), had the most supporters. In late 1924 and early 1925, 1,250 were ordered from France and the Polish Ministry of War started talks on buying the license for manufacturing copies in Poland. However, the first tests of the post-war Hotchkiss machine guns proved that the new production were well below both Polish needs and maker's specifications, and the talks came to a halt. By the end of 1927 the ministry organized a contest for a new standard all-purpose heavy machine gun. Ciƒô≈ºki Karabin Maszynowy wz.30 Wielka Encyklopedia Uzbrojenia M.S.Wojsk. 1918 - 1939 (\\"Great Encyclopedia of Armaments\\"). Retrieved Four companies took part in the competition: the American Colt company with the M1928 (modified export variant of the Browning M1917A1), a Czechoslovakian-built rechambered version of Schwarzlose M.7/12 (Schwarzlose-Janeƒçek vz.7/24), the British Vickers machine gun converted to 7.92mm caliber, and Hotchkiss with improved wz.25 model. All initial tests were won by Browning. The tests were repeated in 1928, and again the American weapon won so the Polish ministry decided to purchase a license. The price was however very high ($450,000) and Colt demanded an order for 3,000 guns in its own factories. It turned out that neither the Colt company nor its European representative, the Vickers-Armstrong, had patented the design in Poland. In addition, the documentation of a recently purchased license for Browning Automatic Rifle, via Colt's agent, Belgian company Fabrique Nationale de Herstal, was faulty, and deliveries were delayed, which discouraged the Polish from further orders abroad. Because of that, the Polish ministry decided to order the preparation of a local version of the Browning M1917 at Fabryka Karabinow (\\"Rifle Factory\\") in Warsaw. Modifications In mid-1930 the first test models were ready and were sent to various testing ranges. In March 1931 the first 200 models were sent to front-line units for further tests under the designation of Ckm wz.30. Serial production started by the end of that year. Among the most notable differences between the original and the Polish clone were: Ckm wz. 30 mounted on a Polish Army motorcycle Sok√≥≈Ç 1000 with the handle and sights adapted for anti-aircraft fire, photo from before 1 September 1939 # Different calibre, adapted to the Polish standard 7.92√ó57mm Mauser ammunition # Loophole iron sights replaced with V-notch sights # Butt handle of the weapon was lengthened for easier carriage # Longer barrel for greater precision and accuracy # Rifle lock was modified for easier exchange of used-up barrels # The lock was modified for easier handling # New mounting was adapted, with a mast for anti-aircraft fire # Sights were adapted for anti-aircraft fire as well as a handle for aiming in the air was added # Added flame suppressor Three types of a tripod mounting were developed and used in Poland. First was wz.30 mounting for infantry (weight 29.3 kg), superseded with improved wz.34 mounting (26.3 kg). Cavalry adopted more modern wz.36 mounting instead (17 kg). All tripods could be used for anti-aircraft fire, using a mast, transported in a rear leg in case of infantry mountings, or folded below the barrel and fulfilling also a role of a recoil shock absorber, in case of the cavalry mounting. Following the first tests, a series of additional modifications was introduced. In 1938 the trigger mechanism was replaced with a completely new, more reliable system. In addition, the lock was replaced for easier handling and keeping the weapon in good condition. The modified design received the designation of ckm wz.30a, though the name was rarely used by the soldiers themselves. The new version was also the basis of a ckm wz.30/39T design, designed for export to Turkey and adapted to Turkish standard 7.65√ó53mm Argentine ammunition. However, the design was never introduced in large numbers as the Turkish competition was halted after World War II broke out. In the late 30s, Wilniewczyc and Skrzypinski designed experimental barrels with a rifled oval barrel bore (\\"Lancaster rifling\\"). The barrels were very expensive to produce, but gave a significant increase of the accuracy and longevity of the barrel. Altogether, between 1931 and 1939, the Fabryka Karabinow (\\"Rifle Factory\\") in Warsaw built at least 8,401 ckm wz.30 for the Polish Army, in addition to 200 of information series (available are only data until March 1939, and several hundreds more were probably built by September 1939). In addition, quite a big number - over 1,700 - was exported by the SEPEWE syndicate to Republican Spain. There were trials to sell them also to other countries, like Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Yugoslavia and Argentina, but in spite of favourable participation in contests, the state factory had no resources to credit deliveries. Among others, in 1936 in Argentina the wz.30 machine gun was evaluated as more reliable and accurate than original Browning M1928, but Colt could ensure more favourable conditions of delivery. In 1938 Turkey ordered 500 wz.30/39T machine guns and probably at least part of this contract was fulfilled. Captured weapons were used by Nationalist Spain, Nazi Germany and Romania. After 1939, many preserved wz.30 machine guns were used by Polish partisan units (mainly Home Army), among others during Warsaw Uprising.

The scheme was first outlined in the 1980 white paper A New Training Initiative: A Programme for Action, and it was brought into operation in 1983 to replace the Youth Opportunities Programme by the government of Margaret Thatcher. Initially lasting one year or six months, the scheme was amended in 1986 to be so that it could be extended to two years. The 1981 England riots encouraged that, by bringing into sharp focus the results of large numbers of unskilled unemployed finding their own solutions. The scheme promised training to its applicants and made use of a variety of different training locales such as businesses, colleges of further education or training workshops run by voluntary organisations. Since the training place was guaranteed by the government and trainees were to be paid if they were on the course, eligibility for unemployment benefit was withdrawn. Accredited organisations were required to provide at least 13 weeks per year of training away from the job and include life skills and social skills. A standardised form of certification was issued at the end of the training period. In 1989, it was renamed Youth Training and was placed under the management of local training and enterprise councils. The trainees on the schemes could be classified as either trainee status or employed status. The difference was distinguished by whether the trainee was recruited by an employer and provided with training for the company needs or if the trainee was being trained by a training organisation using employers as training placements. Often, employed status trainees would have their training allowance improved by the employer.  Criticism  The YTS attracted political and social criticism from an early point. Critics claimed that the scheme enabled employers to exploit school leavers for cheap labour, and it provided little substance in the way of genuine education. The broad left alliance of musicians, artists, comedians and writers, Red Wedge, criticised YTS for its discriminatory nature toward black people and women.‚ÄúA State of Independence‚Äù, Fact Not Fiction Series, no.1. The government's line was that the scheme was an effective counter to the drop in apprenticeships and marked rise in youth unemployment that was seen in the early 1980s.

His baroque paintings show a clear influence of Italian masters like Giordano, Maratta, Barocci and southern Dutch painters like Rubens, Van Dyck and Boekhorst. His daughter, Anne de Deyster, born in 1696, also became a painter and maker of musical instruments. Biography Deyster was born in 1656 in Bruges. He was a scholar of Jan Maes, a respectable artist of that city. From 1682‚Äì1688, he lived and worked in Italy, and when he returned to his native Bruges, he brought with him a flamboyant Roman Baroque style. He was of a deeply religious temper and his character was reflected in his choice of subjects. He painted many pictures for the churches of his native city. His prints, all religious subjects, share with his paintings high drama and energy, with protagonists arranged in complex poses. Just as de Deyster applied his paint with freedom and spontaneity, so did he etch the plate. In the Church of St James at Bruges, there are three fine paintings by Deyster representing the Crucifixion, the Resurrection, and the death of the Virgin. In the Church of St Anne, also in Bruges, there is a work on the Martydom of St Sebastian.

Until about 1891 a tower, possibly of the preceptory church, together with a vaulted undercroft, survived as part the Temple farmhouse. Temple farmhouse was subsequently rebuilt and a 15th-century window and a stone pinnacle remain in the garden\\"Antram, (1989), 107 History of the preceptory The preceptory was, according to William Dugdale, founded either in or before 1164. This is recorded in Dugdale‚Äôs Monasticom, which states that Hubert de Rye presented the Templars with church of Aslackby with its chapel \\"in the year when Thomas, archbishop of Canterbury departed from the King at Northampton\\" ‚Äì i.e., 1164.Dugdale Monasticom, Vol. IV, p. 835, quoted by \\"Sister Elspeth\\", p. 212. After the order was suppressed in the first decade of the 14th century, the property passed to Temple Bruer. The Templars The word preceptory is used for the community of the Knights Templar which lived on one of the order's estates in the charge of its preceptor. From that its meaning was extended to include the estate and its buildings. The one at Aslackby was founded in 1192. Little of its structure survives, but early descriptions and sketches indicate that its church was like that at Temple Bruer Preceptory, a chancel with an apsidal east end and a round nave to its west. This was a standard design for Templar churches, in imitation of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The best-known example in England is the Temple Church at the western end of the City of London. Later, towers were built at both the Lincolnshire churches, the one at Aslackby apparently around 1200, on the south side of the round nave.White, A. Lincolnshire Museums Archaeology Series No.25 (1981) In 1192 there was already a village with a small castle. The honour of Craon was divided, and one third of a knight‚Äôs fee was granted to the Templars who managed it from Aslackby CW - U.T. The Hospitallers When the order was disbanded in 1312, most of the property was transferred to another order, the Knights Hospitaller. Whereas the Templars had been established to protect people on pilgrimages to Jerusalem, the Hospitallers had the additional concern of providing accommodation for them. Under the Hospitallers, the equivalent of a preceptory was a commandery, but Aslackby was not managed by the Hospitallers in this way. After 1312, the property was managed by leasing it out. Until the dissolution of the Hospitallers' order in England in 1540‚Äì41, the Aslackby estate was supervised from Temple Bruer, so the buildings lost their higher status use from the early 14th century, unlike most English monastic buildings, which were in use until the 16th century. In 1539, the buildings were said to be in ruins. After the Hospitallers' houses in England were dissolved, the Aslackby lands were transferred into the secular hands of Lord Clinton. Evidence for the Medieval Preceptory In 1789 Richard Gough in his revision of Camden states that the Preceptory might only have commenced when John Le Marshall, the heir to Hubert de Rye granted a messuage or principal dwelling in 1193. He goes on to state ‚Äò‚ÄòHere was round church, now rebuilt as a farm house, and still called the Temple‚Äô.‚ÄùCamden‚Äôs Britannia‚Äù, (1806 ed.), Vol ii, pg 355. This would suggest that there was a local memory of a round church, similar to Temple Bruer Preceptory and that it may not have been finally demolished until the 18th century. Shortly after this in 1791John Byng the diarist, who later became Viscount Torrington, visited Temple farm. He records a turreted building and I was civilly shewn into the lower room , now a dairy, curiously arch‚Äôd with stone, and with coats of arms in the centre. Around this house was a great park, well timber‚Äôd and stock‚Äôd with deer, which was destroyed about eighty years ago. Byng also made a sketch of the tower with an arched doorway at ground level.‚Äò‚ÄòWhite‚Äù (1981) pg. 5. The original diary of John Byng with the drawing is in Lincoln Central Library In 1808 John Moore, the historian of the nearby town of Bourne, Lincolnshire published a note about Aslackby Preceprtory in The Gentleman's Magazine and promised a engraving of the Preceptory in the second part the History of the Hundred of Aveland. This was not published, but about 1835 an engraving of the village of Aslackby by W.Watkins from a sketch by J. B. Topham was published. This shows the Temple Farm and the Preceptory tower.‚Äò‚ÄòWhite‚Äù (1981) pg. 5.

Detailed drawings of the tower were made. It is noted that a number of architectural fragments were taken to a garden in Horbling.

The Catalan government regularly surveys its population regarding its \\"sentiment of belonging\\". As of July 2019, the results point out that 46.7% of the Catalans and other people living in Catalonia would like independence from Spain, 1.3% less than the year before. Historical background In 1500 BCE the area that is now known primarily as Catalonia was, along with the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, inhabited by Proto-Celtic Urnfield people who brought with them the rite of burning the dead. Much of the Pyrenees mountains was inhabited at the time by peoples related to modern Basques, and today many town names in the western Catalan Pyrenees can be linked to Basque etymologies. These groups came under the rule of various invading groups starting with the Greeks that founded Emp√∫ries and the Phoenicians and Carthaginians, who set up colonies along the coast, including Barcino (present-day Barcelona). Following the Punic Wars, the Romans replaced the Carthaginians as the dominant power in the Iberian eastern coast, including parts of Catalonia, by 206 BCE. Rome established Latin as the official language and imparted a distinctly Roman culture upon the local population, which merged with Roman colonists from the Italian peninsula. An early precursor to the Catalan language began to develop from a local form of popular Latin before and during the collapse of the Roman Empire. Various Germanic tribes arrived following nearly six centuries of Roman rule, which had completely transformed the area into the Roman province of Tarraconensis. The german Visigoths established themselves in the fifth century, making their first capital in the Iberian peninsula Barcelona, and they later would move to Toledo. This continued until 718 when Muslim Arabs took control of the region in order to pass through the Pyrenees into French territory. With the help of the Franks, a land border was created commonly known nowadays as Old Catalonia (which would consist of the counties County of Barcelona, Ausona, County of Pallars, County of Rossell√≥, County of Emp√∫ries, County of Cerdanya and County of Urgell) which faced Muslim raids but resisted any kind of settlement from them. \\"New Catalonia\\" and its native peoples were fully in control of the Arab invaders for around a century. The Franks on the other side of the Pyrenees held back the main Muslim raiding army which had penetrated virtually unchallenged as far as central France at the Battle of Tours in 732. Frankish suzerainty was then extended over much of present-day Catalonia. Larger wars with the Muslims began in the March of Barcelona which led to the beginnings of the Reconquista by Catalan forces over most of Catalonia by the year 801. As the border between Muslim and Frankish realms stabilized, Barcelona would become an important center for Christian forces in the Iberian Peninsula. Battle of the Puig by Andreu Mar√ßal de Sax depicting the Christian victory with the aid of Saint George. In 1137, the County of Barcelona entered a dynastic union with the kingdom of Aragon to form what modern historians call the Crown of Aragon in the so-called Reconquista. This allowed the reclaim of Muslim-dominanted lands, eventually conquering the kingdoms of Valencia and Majorca (the Balearic Islands). From the 14th century, the territory of the Catalan counties started to be called the Principality of Catalonia. In the last quarter of the 15th century, the marriage of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon led to the dynastic union of the Crown of Arag√≥n with the Crown of Castille, in which each of the constitutive territories kept its own laws, power structures, borders and monetary systems. Regional unrest led to conflicts such as the Revolt of the Germanies in Valencia and Majorca, and the 1640 revolt in Catalonia known as the Reapers' War. This latter conflict embroiled Spain in a larger war with France as many Catalan nobles allied themselves with Louis XIII. The war continued until 1659 and ended with the Peace of the Pyrenees, which effectively partitioned Catalonia as the northern strip of the March came under French rule, while the rest remained under Spanish hegemony. The Catalan government took sides with the Habsburg pretender against the Bourbon one during the War of the Spanish Succession that started in 1705 and ended in 1714. The Catalan failure to defend the continuation of Habsburg rule in Spain culminated in the surrender of Barcelona on 11 September 1714 which came to be commemorated as Catalonia's National Day. After the Catalan defeat during the War of Spanish Succession, Philip V of Spain ordered the burning of all the Catalan flags and banners. During the Napoleonic Wars, much of Catalonia was seized by French forces by 1808, as France ruled the entire country of Spain briefly until Napoleon's surrender to Allied Armies. In France, strong assimilationist policies integrated many Catalans into French society, while in Spain a Catalan identity was increasingly suppressed in favor of a Spanish national identity. The Catalans regained autonomy during the Spanish Second Republic from 1932 until Francisco Franco's nationalist forces retook Catalonia by 1939. It was not until 1975 and the death of Franco that the Catalans as well as other Spaniards began to regain their right to cultural expression, which was restarted by the Spanish Constitution of 1978. Since this period, a balance between a sense of local identity versus the broader Spanish one has emerged as the dominant political force in Catalonia. The former tends to advocate for even greater autonomy and independence; the latter tends to argue for maintaining either a status quo or removal of autonomy and cultural identity, depending on the leanings of the current government. As a result, there tends to be much fluctuation depending on regional and national politics during a given election cycle. Given the stronger centralist tendencies in France, however, French Catalans display a much less dynamic sense of uniqueness, having been integrated more consistently into the unitary French national identity. Geography The vast majority of Catalans reside in the autonomous community of Catalonia, in the northeast part of Spain. At least 100,000 Catalan speakers live in the Pays Catalan in France. An indeterminate number of Catalans emigrated to the Americas during the Spanish colonial period and to France in the years following the Spanish Civil War. Culture and society The castells, human towers, are part of the Catalan culture since 1712 and were declared by UNESCO to be amongst the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.BBC, Close-Up: Catalonia's human towers Described by author Walter Starkie in The Road to Santiago as a subtle people, he sums up their national character with a local term seny meaning \\"common sense\\" or a pragmatic attitude toward life. The counterpart of Catalan \\"seny\\" is \\"rauxa\\" or madness, epitomized by \\"crazy\\", eccentric and creative Catalan artists like Antoni Gaud√≠, Salvador Dal√≠, Joan Mir√≥ or Antoni T√†pies. The masia or mas is a defining characteristic of the Catalan countryside and includes a large house, land, cattle, and an extended family, but this tradition is in decline as the nuclear family has largely replaced the extended family, as in the rest of western Europe. Catalans in Spain are officially recognised as a \\"nationality\\" and enjoy a high degree of political autonomy, which has led to reinforcement of a Catalan identity. =Language= A Catalan speaker, recorded for Wikitongues. The Catalan language is a Romance language. It is the language closest to Occitan, and it also shares many features with other Romance languages such as Spanish, French, Portuguese, Aragonese, and Italian. There are a number of linguistic varieties that are considered dialects of Catalan, among them, the dialect group with the most speakers, Central Catalan. The total number of Catalan speakers is over 9.8 million (2011), with 5.9 million residing in Catalonia. More than half of them speak Catalan as a second language, with native speakers being about 4.4 million of those (more than 2.8 in Catalonia).Informe sobre la situaci√≥ de la llengua catalana (2011) Report on the situation of the Catalan language (2011) Very few Catalan monoglots exist; basically, virtually all of the Catalan speakers in Spain are bilingual speakers of Catalan and Spanish, with a sizable population of Spanish-only speakers of immigrant origin (typically born outside Catalonia or with both parents born outside Catalonia) existing in the major Catalan urban areas as well. In Roussillon, only a minority of French Catalans speak Catalan nowadays, with French being the majority language for the inhabitants after a continued process of language shift. According to a 2019 survey by the Catalan government, 31.5% of the inhabitants of Catalonia have Catalan as first language at home whereas 52.7% have Spanish, 2.8% both Catalan and Spanish and 10.8% other languages. The inhabitants of the Aran valley count Aranese‚Äìan Occitan dialect‚Äìrather than Catalan as their own language. These Catalans are also bilingual in Spanish. In September 2005, the .cat TLD, the first Internet language-based top-level domain, was approved for all web pages intending to serve the needs of the Catalan linguistic and cultural community on the Internet. This community is made up of those who use the Catalan language for their online communication or promote the different aspects of Catalan culture online. =Traditional clothes= The traditional dress (now practically only used in folkloric celebrations) included the barretina (a sort of woollen, long cap usually red or purple in colour) and the faixa (a sort of wide belt) among men, and ret (a fine net bag to contain hair) among women. The traditional footwear was the espardenya or espadrille. Catalan children wearing the traditional outfit, including the barretina. =Cuisine= Traditional diet The Catalan diet is part of the Mediterranean diet and includes the use of olive oil. Catalan people like to eat veal (vedella) and lamb (xai). There are three main daily meals: * In the morning: a very light breakfast, consisting of fruit or fruit juice, milk, coffee, or pa amb tom√†quet \\"bread with tomato\\". Catalans tend to divide their breakfast into two parts: one early in the morning before going to work or study (first breakfast), and the other one between 10:00 and 12:00 (second breakfast) * In the afternoon (roughly from 13:00 to 14:30): the main meal of the day, usually comprising three dishes. The first consists of pasta or vegetables, the second of meat or fish, and the third of fruit or yogurt * In the evening (roughly from 20:00 to 22:30): more food than in the morning, but less than at lunch; very often only a single main dish and fruit; it is common to drink moderate quantities of wine. In Catalan gastronomy, embotits (a wide variety of Catalan sausages and cold meats) are very important; these are pork sausages such as botifarra or fuet. In the past, bread figured heavily in the Catalan diet; now it is used mainly in the morning (second breakfast, especially among young students and some workers) and supplements the noon meal, at home and in restaurants. Bread is still popular among Catalans; some Catalan fast-food restaurants don't serve hamburgers, but offer a wide variety of sandwiches. In the past, the poor ate soup every day and rice on Thursday and Sunday. Catalans have a rich cuisine, including traditional desserts like the xuixo. Also, Catalan chefs like Ferran Adri√† i Acosta or Jordi Roca i Fontan√© are widely renowned. The discipline of abstinence, not eating meat during Lent, once was very strong, but today it is only practiced in the rural areas. Spicy food is rare in the Catalan diet but there are quite garlicky sauces such as allioli or romesco. Traditional dishes One type of Catalan dish is escudella, a soup which contains chick peas, potatoes, and vegetables such as green cabbage, celery, carrots, turnips, and meats such as botifarra (a Catalan sausage), pork feet, salted ham, chicken, and veal. In Northern Catalonia, it is sometimes called ollada. Other Catalan dishes are cal√ßots (similar to leeks and often eaten with a romesco sauce) and escalivada. =Music= Catalan music has one of the oldest documented musical traditions in Europe. Catalans, traditionally devoted Catholics, during its recent history had become less religious. Even so, the presence of religion is maintained through the traditions, values and monuments, like the Church of Sant Crist√≤fol de Beget. =Religion= The traditional religion in Catalonia is Roman Catholicism. However, in the course of recent history, Catalonia has undergone several waves of secularization. The first wave of secularization happened during the eighteenth century as a result of the enlightenment influence to the bourgeoisie. The second one happened during the nineteenth century, that had a huge impact on the lower and middle class, but was interrupted by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939). The end of the Francoist regime led to a loss of power by the Catholic Church and to another wave of secularization that extends since the 1980s. During the 1990s most of the population of Catalonia was non-practising Catholic. Nowadays 52.4% of Catalans declare themselves Catholic, practising or not, 30.2% of Catalans are agnostic or atheist, and there is also a considerable share of other religions, often connected to recent immigration: 7.3% Muslim, 2.5% Evangelical, 1.3% Buddhism, and 1.2% Orthodox Christians. According to the most recent study sponsored by the government of Catalonia, as of 2016, 61.9% of the Catalans identify as Christians, up from 56.5% in 2014. p. 30. Quick data from the 2014 barometer of Catalonia . At the same time, 16.0% of the population identify as atheists, 11.9% as agnostics, 4.8% as Muslims, 1.3% as Buddhists, and a further 2.4% as being of other religions. p. 30. Quick data from the 2016 barometer of Catalonia . =Social conditions= Catalonia is one of the richest and most developed regions in Southern Europe. Barcelona is among the most industrialized metropolises and a both regional capital and a magnet for various migrants from other regions in Spain, as well as from foreign countries. =Celebrations= Fire is the element used in most important traditional festivals, which are derived from pagan roots. These celebrations have a high acceptance of fire between the Catalans, like the Flame of Canig√≥ to the Bonfires of Saint John. An important and well-known celebration is La Diada de Sant Jordi, held on 23 April, in which men give women roses, and women give men a book. Saint George's Day In Barcelona Historical memory is the second axis of celebrations in Catalonia, where the Catalan people reunite with their date of birth as a people. Among the religious celebrations, there are St. George's Day and the celebrations of Saint Vincent Martyr and Saint Anthony Abbot. The maximum expressions of this element are the Easter processions and performances of Passion Plays. Some festivals have a complicated relationship with religion, such as Carnival and the Dances of Death, or specific aspects of Christmas such as the Ti√≥ de Nadal or the caganer in Nativity scenes. Other key elements of a Catalan celebration are: food, central to every party and especially to the pig slaughter and harvest festivals; contests such as the castells (human towers), choice of major and festive floats; music, songs and bands; processions; dances; and animals, especially bulls and representations of mythological creatures. The Patum of Berga has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. =Symbolism= Because of their intertwining history, many of the traditional symbols of Catalonia coincide with Aragon, Valencia and the Balearic Islands. The oldest known Catalan symbol is the coat of arms of the King of Aragon, or bars of Aragon, one of Europe's oldest heraldic emblems; in modern times, Catalan nationalists have made it the main symbol of Catalan identity and it is even associated with the Catalan language. As for anthems, \\"The Reapers\\" (Els Segadors) is the official anthem of Catalonia and is also used in the other lands of the Principality; the Balanguera represents the people from the Balearic Islands and, in the case of Valencia, the official \\"Anthem of the Exhibition\\" (Himne de l'Exposici√≥) alongside Muixeranga as symbols of the country.

Once a pearl diving and fishing community which frequently disputed the rule of Ras Al Khaimah, today it forms the northern coastal settlement of the city.  History  A coastal community, Rams' hinterland consists of palm groves and the Dhayah fort. It was at Rams that the British punitive expedition landed in 1819, following the sack of Ras Al Khaimah. The British fought their way inland to Dhayah, where they encountered spirited resistance, finally taking the surrender of almost 800 men, women and children after bombarding the hill fort there. The General Maritime Treaty of 1820 was signed by Hassan bin Ali, 'Sheikh of Zyah' who was, in fact, the Sheikh of Rams and Dhayah. Rams was traditionally home to the Tanaij tribe, all 400 houses there were settled by the early 19th century by that tribe. Almost a hundred years later, the village had a single shop, kept by a Persian gentleman, and some 7,000 date palms. The inland area of Dhayah was by then uninhabited, having been sacked by the British in 1819. They mostly relied on pearl fishing, with a fleet of 3 pearl boats and 10 fishing boats. The Tanaij of Rams would frequently hire members of the unruly mountain Shihuh tribe for pearling expeditions. Themselves unruly subjects, Rams frequently came into conflict with the Rulers of Ras Al Khaimah. It has a long, 1.6 km beach, which has in recent year witnessed a number of ecological disasters, including a mass death event where thousands of dead fish, thought to be sardines, were washed up on the beach in May 2018. Earlier in the year, a 9-meter whale was washed up. With its long history of pearl fishing, many of the older buildings in Rams (constructed from wood, coral and local materials) are being considered for redevelopment.

In 1918, the Prince of Asir, Yahya bin Hasun Al Ayde, grandson of Ibn Ayed, returned to his family throne conquered in Abha with complete independence. In 1920, Asir was conquered by the Ikhwan tribesmen of Nejd loyal to Ibn Saud during the Unification of Saudi Arabia.

Transportation A coastal road connecting Jeddah and Abha was completed in 1979. A SAPTCO bus station connects Abha to other destinations within Saudi Arabia. Abha Regional Airport (, IATA: AHB[3], ICAO: OEAB) is Abha's main airport. International connections are available to Yemen (Sana'a), Egypt (Cairo), Qatar (Doha) and the UAE (Dubai, Sharjah), as well as to other destinations within Saudi Arabia. Construction of Dutch-designed Abha Airport began in mid-1975, and flights began in 1977. Before construction of the airport, domestic flights were serviced by the military airport near Khamis Mushait by Ali Misfer Ibn Misfer, who was the founder of aviation in Abha in 1945. Landmarks The city of Abha is composed of four quarters, the largest of which contains a fortress. Hilltop fortresses are a characteristic feature of the city. Shadda Palace, built in 1927, is now a museum displaying local handicrafts and household items. Other notable buildings in Abha include the Abha Great Mosque, the Al-Tahy restaurant, the Abha Palace Hotel, and the funpark next to Lake Sadd. The New Abha five-star hotel is a recent construction on the lake, southwest of the town. The head office and the main printing presses of Al Watan, a major Saudi daily, are in Abha. Culture The Saudi government has promoted Abha as a tourist destination. The city hosts events to attract visitors to the city and its surroundings, including the summer Abha Festival, sporting events, shows, exhibitions, and musical performances poets and singers. The artist Talal Maddah died on stage during one such performance in Abha. Education King Khalid University is a public university in Abha. The University was established in 1999 by merging the Imam Muhammed bin Saud University of Islamic Studies and the King Saud University of the South. Geography and climate Abha sky Abha is located in the southern region of Asir at an elevation of about above sea level. Abha lies on the western edge of Mount Al-Hijaz, near Jabal Sawda, the highest peak in Saudi Arabia. Treating the Asir Mountains as part of the Sarawat, the landscape is otherwise dominated by the Sarawat Mountains. The climate of Abha is semi-arid (K√∂ppen: BSh) and it is influenced by city's high elevation.[inaccessible source] The city's weather is generally mild throughout the year, becoming noticeably cooler during the \\"low-sun\\" season. Abha seldom sees temperatures rise above during the course of the year. The city averages of rainfall annually, with the bulk of the precipitation occurring between February and April, with a secondary minor wet season in July and August.

The Juvaquatre was produced as a sedan/saloon until 1948 when the plant switched its full attention to the new Renault 4CV. During the second half of 1952 the plant restarted production of the Juvaquatre sedans/saloons for a period of approximately five months. In 1950 a van based station wagon body joined the range; later models of the station wagon (from 1956 on) were known as the Renault Dauphinoise (). The sedan/saloon found itself overshadowed and was soon withdrawn from production after the appearance in 1946 of the Renault 4CV (which was France's top selling car in the post-war years). However, there was no estate version of the rear engined 4CV or Dauphine, and the Juvaquatre \\"Dauphinoise\\" station wagon remained in production until replaced by the Renault 4 in 1960. Origins The Juvaquatre was originally conceived in 1936 by Louis Renault as a small, affordable car designed to occupy the 6CV car tax class and to fit in the Renault range below existing more upmarket models such as the Primaquatre and Celtaquatre. The company was focused on creating new customers who would not otherwise buy Renaults, and on appealing to the new class of lower-income consumer created by changing labor conditions and the rise of the Popular Front in France in the 1930s (which ironically had adversely affected Renault considerably). The Juvaquatre was heavily inspired by the German Opel Olympia, a car by which the patron had been impressed during a 1935 visit to Berlin. Consequently, the Juvaquatre, particularly early models, bore a strong resemblance to the Olympia.Odin, L.C. World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG. Launch The Juvaquatre was showcased at the 1937 Paris Motor Show, on the opening day of which Louis Renault was photographed showing a Juvaquatre to President Lebrun. The motor show launch was part of a wider strategy to prepare for the start of volume production the next year. The first production prototype, identified as the \\"Juvaquatre AEB1\\", had been homologated with the relevant agency in February 1937. Four months later, in the early summer, Louis Renault gave orders for the construction of a batch of at least twenty preproduction prototypes identified as the \\"Juvaquatre AEB2\\". Most of these were handed over to a selection of major Renault distributors who were invited to submit the cars to technical and customer appraisals. On the basis of the reports received following this exercise the engineers at Renault's Billancourt plant were able to apply the necessary modifications before volume production of the \\"AEB2\\" got underway in April 1938. On the publicity front, a non-stop endurance run was organised during the closing days of March 1938: a Juvaquatre was driven flat out round and round the Montlh√©ry racing circuit (a short distance to the west of Paris), driven by a team of four drivers who took turns to cover a distance of 5,391 kilometers (3,350 miles) during 50 hours at an average speed which was computed at slightly under 109 km/h (68 mph). Details =Bodies= During the initial production phase, all Juvaquatres came as two doors saloons/sedans (sometimes described in francophone sources as a \\"coach\\" body). The steel body was welded into the chassis-platform in order to create what was for most purposes a monocoque body shell. Instead of perching on the front wings, the headlights, were integrated into the body, which was seen as a clear tribute to the Opel Olympia, although the idea of integrating headlights in this way had originated not with Opel but, in 1934, with the American Hupmobile Type 518 of 1934. Renault Dauphinoise fourgonette A camionette (van) version of the Juvaquatre was developed soon afterwards for commercial usage and was used extensively by La Poste. When the van version reappeared in 1948, after the war the \\"camionette\\" appellation for the little van was switched \\"fourgonette\\". Public demand for four-door cars, and the introduction of affordable 4-door models from the rival manufacturers Peugeot and Simca, led to the appearance of a 4-door Juvaquatre (normally described in French- language sources as a \\"berline\\" bodied car) from April 1939. Perhaps 80 2-seater coup√© bodied Juvaquatres were built between 1939 and 1946, of which most were based on the prewar model and produced in 1939 and 1940. There was probably an intention to resume production of the coup√© after the war, but the tooling was never commissioned to produce the necessary steel body-panels using heavy presses, which would have been necessary to produce the design in commercial volumes. According to one source a final batch of 30 coup√©s was produced between December 1945 and January 1946,Renault Juvaquatre Renault Home Page (in French) while elsewhere it is recorded that production of this version was not resumed after the war. Nevertheless, one was still on display at the Brussels Motor Show in January 1948, adding to the variety on the Renault show stand and suggesting that at that stage it was still intended to produce more Juvaquatre coup√©s. A station wagon model based on the van, known initially simply as the \\"Renault Break 300 Kg\\" was launched only in 1950. This version, rebranded in 1956 as the \\"Renault Dauphinoise\\", would remain in production for nearly a decade after the withdrawal of the saloon/sedan versions of the Juvaquatre, since the rear engined configurations of Renault's post war small cars, the 4CV and the Dauphine made them far less suitable for conversion to the station wagon format than the front engined Juvaquatre. =Engine= The four-cylinder water-cooled engine with which the Juvaquatre was launched in 1937 (and which continued to power the car till the mid 1950s) shared the 95 mm cylinder stroke of the broadly similar engine that had powered the Renault Celtaquatre since 1934. On the Juvaquatre the cylinder bore (diameter was reduced to 58 mm, however, giving rise to an overall engine capacity of just 1003cc. The engine was a side-valve unit, and at launch a maximum power output of was listed. Significantly, market dynamics dictated that Renault's Juvaquatre was destined to spend more than ten years competing head to head with the Peugeot 202 which from the start came with a more modern ohv power unit (and more power). The old side-valve unit was finally laid to rest in 1952 and the Juvaquatre Break (estate/station wagon) which was by now the only surviving Juvaquatre version received the smaller 747cc engine from the Renault 4CV. The overhead valve unit produced slightly less power than before, but the Juvaquatre Break was valued for its dependability and low cost rather than for performance, and the new unit came with the bonus of a lower annual car tax bill now that the model was in the 4CV tax band. In 1956 the car moved back up a notch to the 5CV band when it received the bored out version of the same engine fitted at the back of the new Renault Dauphine. The connection with the Dauphine was stressed by the rebranding of the Juvaquatre Break which was now christened the Renault Dauphinoise. The engine size was now 845cc and listed maximum power was up to (SAE). =Running gear and brakes= Power was transmitted from the front-mounted engine to the rear wheels via a traditional three-speed manual gear box, with synchromesh on the upper two ratios. The Juvaquatre featured independent suspension at the front. Renault were the last of the \\"big 3\\" French automakers, in 1937, to offer independent front suspension on a passenger car: Peugeot had claimed a world first for independent front suspension in the volume car sector, with a 1931 upgrade for the Peugeot 201, and Citroen had made a start back in 1934. The front suspension assemblies on the Juvaquatre were intended to minimize the risk of wear on the components leading to misalignment of the wheels, featuring just three joints on each assembly and the transversely mounted leaf spring constituting the fourth flexible element of a simple parallelogramme structure. The rear wheels were attached using the tried and trusted combination of a rigid axle mounted with transverse leaf springs. The brakes on the Juvaquatre were mechanically controlled on the early cars, but \\"Lockheed\\" hydraulic brakes were introduced in 1939. Market positioning A feature of the French auto-market during the final years of the 1930s was the emergence of a modern category of small family cars in the 6CV taxation class, offering modern body designs clearly influenced by the streamlining fashion of that time. The Renault Juvaquatre was one of three major players in this category which, thanks to the intervention of war, was still significant in the late 1940s. The Renault's side-valve engine positioned it at the bargain- basement end of the class, confirmed by an advertised starting price for the two-door sedan/saloon of 16,500 Francs at the 1937 Paris Motor Show. The Peugeot 202 was not exhibited at the 1937 show, but went on sale early in 1938 with a starting price of 21,300 Francs for a car with four doors and a more modern engine, while the Simca 8, essentially a rebadged, locally assembled Fiat, appeared at the 1937 show already with hydraulic brakes, a four-speed gear box and independent front suspension, advertised at a sticker price of 23,900 francs for the four-door \\"Normale\\" sedan/saloon. Half a class up, the front-wheel-drive 7CV Amilcar Compound, was advertised at the Motor Show at an aggressive 21,700 Francs for a \\"coach-normal\\" (2-door base version) with independent front suspension. Despite its side-valve engine, the Amilcar was in several respect more technically ambitious than the other three cars identified here, but the manufacturer lost its independence in 1937 and the name would disappear in 1940. Ten years later, after a period of savage currency depreciation, the advertised prices had changed, but the relative positions of three competitors in the 6CV class had not. At the 1947 Paris Motor Show the Juvaquatre, now offering four doors and independent front suspension as standard, came with an advertised starting price of 260,000 Francs. The Peugeot 202, its showroom appeal now enhanced with the inclusion of a steel panel sun-roof, was priced at 303,600 Francs while the sticker price for a Simca 8 had risen to 330,000 Francs. During the war Renault Juvaquatre (1939)The rate of Juvaquatre production decreased considerably with the onset of World War II, but remained high compared to other European marques who had switched over almost entirely to production of military equipment. After France was taken over by Nazi Germany, Juvaquatre production slowed to a trickle, with only a few hundred cars built 1941. This is the end of official production (until after the war) but a very small series was still turned out until 1942, and in 1943, 1944, and 1945, the occasional car was assembled for the occupation forces or for French government use. After the war Four-door Juvaquatre, used during the Tet Offensive Juvaquatre production formally restarted in 1946, with Renault now owned and controlled by the French government. There was no sign of the two-door saloon/sedan \\"coach\\" bodied car, the Juvaquatres all now featuring four doors. There was very little to distinguish the first post-war Juvaquatres from the four-door saloon/sedan \\"berline\\" bodied version launched in 1939, but from the back there was now an opening hatch (boot/trunk lid) so that it was no longer necessary to clamber over two sets of seats in the passenger cabin in order to access the luggage compartment. The postwar Juvaquatres were produced during years of acute economic stringency, and were almost all earmarked for export. At Renault's Billancourt plant the emphasis was now on massive investment in tooling for mass production of the new 4CV, soon to become France's top selling car, and at this location production of the Juvaquatre stopped at the end of 1948. A small further batch of saloon/sedan bodied cars was produced during 1951 at the manufacturer's new plant at Flins where the Juvaquatre was the first model to be assembled. Production of the Juvaquatre saloon at Flins finally ended in November 1951. The \\"Break Juva 4\\" (station wagon) remained in production, between 1950 and 1953 retaining the dashboard and side-valve 1,003 cc engine (albeit now enhanced by an air filter) of the prewar cars. From 1956 the old station wagon was fitted with the more modern engine from the Renault Dauphine and found itself rebranded as the Renault Dauphinoise. In the absence of obvious direct competitors, it still sold steadily, with 13,262 produced in 1958 and 9,489 in 1959. The Dauphinoise continued to be listed until 1960, a few months before the appearance of the Renault 4, in its final years sharing its engine with the Renault Dauphine.

Bottom: The spread of National Hurricane Center multi-model ensemble forecast. Ensemble forecasting is a method used in or within numerical weather prediction. Instead of making a single forecast of the most likely weather, a set (or ensemble) of forecasts is produced. This set of forecasts aims to give an indication of the range of possible future states of the atmosphere. Ensemble forecasting is a form of Monte Carlo analysis. The multiple simulations are conducted to account for the two usual sources of uncertainty in forecast models: (1) the errors introduced by the use of imperfect initial conditions, amplified by the chaotic nature of the evolution equations of the atmosphere, which is often referred to as sensitive dependence on initial conditions; and (2) errors introduced because of imperfections in the model formulation, such as the approximate mathematical methods to solve the equations. Ideally, the verified future atmospheric state should fall within the predicted ensemble spread, and the amount of spread should be related to the uncertainty (error) of the forecast. In general, this approach can be used to make probabilistic forecasts of any dynamical system, and not just for weather prediction. Today ensemble predictions are commonly made at most of the major operational weather prediction facilities worldwide, including: * National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP of the US) * European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) * United Kingdom Met Office * M√©t√©o-France * Environment Canada * Japan Meteorological Agency * Bureau of Meteorology (Australia) * China Meteorological Administration (CMA) * Korea Meteorological Administration * CPTEC (Brazil) *Ministry of Earth Sciences (IMD, IITM & NCMRWF) (India) Experimental ensemble forecasts are made at a number of universities, such as the University of Washington, and ensemble forecasts in the US are also generated by the US Navy and Air Force. There are various ways of viewing the data such as spaghetti plots, ensemble means or Postage Stamps where a number of different results from the models run can be compared. History As proposed by Edward Lorenz in 1963, it is impossible for long-range forecasts‚Äîthose made more than two weeks in advance‚Äîto predict the state of the atmosphere with any degree of skill owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved. Furthermore, existing observation networks have limited spatial and temporal resolution (for example, over large bodies of water such as the Pacific Ocean), which introduces uncertainty into the true initial state of the atmosphere. While a set of equations, known as the Liouville equations, exists to determine the initial uncertainty in the model initialization, the equations are too complex to run in real-time, even with the use of supercomputers. The practical importance of ensemble forecasts derives from the fact that in a chaotic and hence nonlinear system, the rate of growth of forecast error is dependent on starting conditions. An ensemble forecast therefore provides a prior estimate of state-dependent predictability, i.e. an estimate of the types of weather that might occur, given inevitable uncertainties in the forecast initial conditions and in the accuracy of the computational representation of the equations. These uncertainties limit forecast model accuracy to about six days into the future.Weickmann, Klaus, Jeff Whitaker, Andres Roubicek and Catherine Smith (2001-12-01). The Use of Ensemble Forecasts to Produce Improved Medium Range (3‚Äì15 days) Weather Forecasts. Climate Diagnostics Center. Retrieved 2007-02-16. The first operational ensemble forecasts were produced for sub- seasonal timescales in 1985. However, it was realised that the philosophy underpinning such forecasts was also relevant on shorter timescales ‚Äì timescales where predictions had previously been made by purely deterministic means. Edward Epstein recognized in 1969 that the atmosphere could not be completely described with a single forecast run due to inherent uncertainty, and proposed a stochastic dynamic model that produced means and variances for the state of the atmosphere. Although these Monte Carlo simulations showed skill, in 1974 Cecil Leith revealed that they produced adequate forecasts only when the ensemble probability distribution was a representative sample of the probability distribution in the atmosphere. It was not until 1992 that ensemble forecasts began being prepared by the European Centre for Medium- Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Methods for representing uncertainty There are two main sources of uncertainty that must be accounted for when making an ensemble weather forecast: initial condition uncertainty and model uncertainty. = Initial condition uncertainty = Initial condition uncertainty arises due to errors in the estimate of the starting conditions for the forecast, both due to limited observations of the atmosphere, and uncertainties involved in using indirect measurements, such as satellite data, to measure the state of atmospheric variables. Initial condition uncertainty is represented by perturbing the starting conditions between the different ensemble members. This explores the range of starting conditions consistent with our knowledge of the current state of the atmosphere, together with its past evolution. There are a number of ways to generate these initial condition perturbations. The ECMWF model, the Ensemble Prediction System (EPS), uses a combination of singular vectors and an ensemble of data assimilations (EDA) to simulate the initial probability density. The singular vector perturbations are more active in the extra-tropics, while the EDA perturbations are more active in the tropics. The NCEP ensemble, the Global Ensemble Forecasting System, uses a technique known as vector breeding. = Model uncertainty = Model uncertainty arises due to the limitations of the forecast model. The process of representing the atmosphere in a computer model involves many simplifications such as the development of parametrisation schemes, which introduce errors into the forecast. Several techniques to represent model uncertainty have been proposed.  Perturbed parameter schemes  When developing a parametrisation scheme, many new parameters are introduced to represent simplified physical processes. These parameters may be very uncertain. For example, the 'entrainment coefficient' represents the turbulent mixing of dry environmental air into a convective cloud, and so represents a complex physical process using a single number. In a perturbed parameter approach, uncertain parameters in the model's parametrisation schemes are identified and their value changed between ensemble members. While in probabilistic climate modelling, such as climateprediction.net, these parameters are often held constant globally and throughout the integration, in modern numerical weather prediction it is more common to stochastically vary the value of the parameters in time and space. The degree of parameter perturbation can be guided using expert judgement, or by directly estimating the degree of parameter uncertainty for a given model.  Stochastic parametrisations  A traditional parametrisation scheme seeks to represent the average effect of the sub grid-scale motion (e.g. convective clouds) on the resolved scale state (e.g. the large scale temperature and wind fields). A stochastic parametrisation scheme recognises that there may be many sub-grid scale states consistent with a particular resolved scale state. Instead of predicting the most likely sub-grid scale motion, a stochastic parametrisation scheme represents one possible realisation of the sub-grid. It does this through including random numbers into the equations of motion. This samples from the probability distribution assigned to uncertain processes. Stochastic parametrisations have significantly improved the skill of weather forecasting models, and are now used in operational forecasting centres worldwide. Stochastic parametrisations were first developed at the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts.  Multi model ensembles  When many different forecast models are used to try to generate a forecast, the approach is termed multi-model ensemble forecasting. This method of forecasting can improve forecasts when compared to a single model-based approach. When the models within a multi-model ensemble are adjusted for their various biases, this process is known as \\"superensemble forecasting\\". This type of a forecast significantly reduces errors in model output. When models of different physical processes are combined, such as combinations of atmospheric, ocean and wave models, the multi-model ensemble is called hyper-ensemble. Probability assessment The ensemble forecast is usually evaluated by comparing the average of the individual forecasts for one forecast variable to the observed value of that variable (the \\"error\\"). This is combined with consideration of the degree of agreement between various forecasts within the ensemble system, as represented by their overall standard deviation or \\"spread\\". Ensemble spread can be visualised through tools such as spaghetti diagrams, which show the dispersion of one quantity on prognostic charts for specific time steps in the future. Another tool where ensemble spread is used is a meteogram, which shows the dispersion in the forecast of one quantity for one specific location. It is common for the ensemble spread to be too small, such that the observed atmospheric state falls outside of the ensemble forecast. This can lead the forecaster to be overconfident in their forecast. This problem becomes particularly severe for forecasts of the weather about 10 days in advance, particularly if model uncertainty is not accounted for in the forecast. = Reliability and resolution (calibration and sharpness) = The spread of the ensemble forecast indicates how confident the forecaster can be in his or her prediction. When ensemble spread is small and the forecast solutions are consistent within multiple model runs, forecasters perceive more confidence in the forecast in general. When the spread is large, this indicates more uncertainty in the prediction. Ideally, a spread-skill relationship should exist, whereby the spread of the ensemble is a good predictor of the expected error in the ensemble mean. If the forecast is reliable, the observed state will behave as if it is drawn from the forecast probability distribution. Reliability (or calibration) can be evaluated by comparing the standard deviation of the error in the ensemble mean with the forecast spread: for a reliable forecast, the two should match, both at different forecast lead times and for different locations. The reliability of forecasts of a specific weather event can also be assessed. For example, if 30 of 50 members indicated greater than 1 cm rainfall during the next 24 h, the probability of exceeding 1 cm could be estimated to be 60%. The forecast would be considered reliable if, considering all the situations in the past when a 60% probability was forecast, on 60% of those occasions did the rainfall actually exceed 1 cm. In practice, the probabilities generated from operational weather ensemble forecasts are not highly reliable, though with a set of past forecasts (reforecasts or hindcasts) and observations, the probability estimates from the ensemble can be adjusted to ensure greater reliability. Another desirable property of ensemble forecasts is resolution. This is an indication of how much the forecast deviates from the climatological event frequency ‚Äì provided that the ensemble is reliable, increasing this deviation will increase the usefulness of the forecast. This forecast quality can also be considered in terms of sharpness, or how small the spread of the forecast is. The key aim of a forecaster should be to maximise sharpness, while maintaining reliability. Forecasts at long leads will inevitably not be particularly sharp (have particularly high resolution), for the inevitable (albeit usually small) errors in the initial condition will grow with increasing forecast lead until the expected difference between two model states is as large as the difference between two random states from the forecast model's climatology. =Calibration of ensemble forecasts= If ensemble forecasts are to be used for predicting probabilities of observed weather variables they typically need calibration in order to create unbiased and reliable forecasts. For forecasts of temperature one simple and effective method of calibration is linear regression, often known in this context as Model output statistics. The linear regression model takes the ensemble mean as a predictor for the real temperature, ignores the distribution of ensemble members around the mean, and predicts probabilities using the distribution of residuals from the regression. In this calibration setup the value of the ensemble in improving the forecast is then that the ensemble mean typically gives a better forecast than any single ensemble member would, and not because of any information contained in the width or shape of the distribution of the members in the ensemble around the mean. However, in 2004, a generalisation of linear regression (now known as Nonhomogeneous Gaussian regression) was introduced that uses a linear transformation of the ensemble spread to give the width of the predictive distribution, and it was shown that this can lead to forecasts with higher skill than those based on linear regression alone. This proved for the first time that information in the shape of the distribution of the members of an ensemble around the mean, in this case summarized by the ensemble spread, can be used to improve forecasts relative to linear regression. Whether or not linear regression can be beaten by using the ensemble spread in this way varies, depending on the forecast system, forecast variable and lead time. =Predicting the size of forecast changes= In addition to being used to improve predictions of uncertainty, the ensemble spread can also be used as a predictor for the likely size of changes in the mean forecast from one forecast to the next. This works because, in some ensemble forecast systems, narrow ensembles tend to precede small changes in the mean, while wide ensembles tend to precede larger changes in the mean. This has applications in the trading industries, for whom understanding the likely sizes of future forecast changes can be important.

In the X Window System, every window is contained within another window, called its parent. This makes the windows form a hierarchy. The root window is the root of this hierarchy. It is as large as the screen, and all other windows are either children or descendants of it. Since every window covers the part of its parent it is staying on, all other windows appear to be above the root window. As a result, the root window is visible as the part of the screen that is behind all other windows. In other words, the root window forms the background of the screen. An image can be used as the wallpaper of the screen by setting it as the background image of the root window. This can be done for example using the \`xsetroot\` or the xv programs. The direct children of the root window are called top-level windows. These windows are usually drawn with a decorative frame and a title bar (which are actually added by the window manager). The top-level windows are, informally, the regular windows in the terminology of most GUIs. The windows that are not top-level are used for buttons, textboxes, etc. The properties of the root window are sometimes used as a rudimentary form of inter-client communication means. For example, the cut buffers are properties of the root window that are used for copying selected text from a window to another, and the dwm window manager displays the root window's name in a status area. The X resources are also stored, during execution, in a property of the root window.  Virtual root window The swm window manager introduced the virtual root window. From the point of view of the X protocol, this is a regular window. However, X window managers using the virtual root window reparent all windows to it instead of to the real root window. Virtual root windows are mainly used by re-parenting window managers, for example, for realizing a number of virtual desktops the user can switch between. Other clients (beside the window manager) may need to use the virtual root window. The identifier of this window can be found in a window property named \`__SWM_VROOT\` in a direct child of the real root window. Technically, many programs use the macros for finding the root windows as redefined by an include file named \`vroot.h\`. The freedesktop window manager specification requires a property named \`_NET_VIRTUAL_ROOTS\` of the real root window to contain a list of the windows that are acting as virtual root windows; the virtual root window that is currently active can be found in the property \`_NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP\` of the real root window. The virtual root window is used by the window managers swm, tvtwm, amiwm, and enlightenment. Other systems such as KDE use a virtual background window (which contains the icons, for example) but do not reparent the other windows to this one. The virtual root window is also used by XScreenSaver: when the screensaver is activated, this program creates a virtual root window, places it at the top of all other windows, and calls one of its hacks (modules), which finds the virtual root window and draws in it.

It was the only issue that year, although popular demand caused it to be reprinted in several editions. All its pages (except for the cover) were in black and white and exclusively contained the work of its founders, Bret√©cher, Gotlib and Mandryka. Marked as a publication for adults, it staked a different course than Pilote magazine, the family-friendly publication the founders had a long relationship with.

It is a very winter-hardy variety that manages to produce high sugar levels in cold climates with moderate to high acidity.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 851, 875 & 1136-1135 Allen Lane 2012 The grape was developed in the 1930s by French wine grape breeder Jean Louis Vidal; his primary goal in developing the variety was for the production of Cognac in the Charente-Maritime region of western France. However, due to its winter hardiness this grape variety is cultivated most extensively in the Canadian wine regions of Ontario, British Columbia and Nova Scotia where it is often used for ice wine production as a permitted grape of the Vintners Quality Alliance.Appellation America \\"Vidal blanc\\" Accessed: April 8th, 2013 It is also grown widely throughout the United States where it is used to produce both dry and sweet wines in the Finger Lakes AVA of New York, Yadkin Valley AVA and Crest of the Blue Ridge, Henderson County AVA of North Carolina, Outer Coastal Plain AVA of Southern New Jersey, Michigan, Virginia, Missouri and other states. The grape is also grown just 500 miles south of the Arctic Circle in Sweden where it is also used to make ice wine.Arthur Max \\"Grape Expectations Flourish Below the Arctic Circle at Swedish Winery\\" Los Angeles Times September 25th, 2005Ray O'Connor \\"Uncovering the past, present and future of Scandinavian wine \\" Scan Magazine, Dec 7th, 2009 The wine produced from Vidal blanc tends to be very fruity, with aroma notes of grapefruit and pineapple. Due to its high acidity and sugar potential, it is particularly suited to sweeter, dessert wines. In particular, because of the tough outer skin of the fruit, it is well adapted for the production of ice wine. It is somewhat resistant to downy mildew but is very susceptible to other viticultural hazards such as coulure and powdery mildew. Parentage Ugni blanc, one of the parent varieties of Vidal blanc. Vidal blanc is a complex, hybrid varietal cultivated from grapevines belonging to several different species within the genus Vitis. One parent, Ugni blanc, is from the Vitis vinifera species of European grapevines that produce most of the world's well-known wines such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. Vidal blanc's second parent, Rayon d'Or, was a Seibel grape with itself also being an inter-specific crossing of Aramon du Gard and Seibel 405 (both inter- specific crossings themselves). Included in this extended family tree of Vidal blanc are varieties from the Vitis rupestris and Vitis aestivalis species and grapes produced by notable hybrid breeders Thomas Volney Munson, Hermann Jaeger and Albert Seibel. History Vidal Blanc was created in the 1930s by French grape breeder Jean-Louis Vidal (1880-1976) as a potential variety to be used in cognac production in the maritime climate and cold winters of western France. To breed to the grape he used Ugni blanc (also known as Trebbiano) in Tuscany, the primary grape historically used in brandy production, and Rayon d'Or, a winter-hardy hybrid grape that was successfully used previously to breed Seyval blanc. Though the variety was created in France, today it is no longer an authorized grape variety with only a few rare plantings remaining in the Charente-Maritime department. Vidal ice wines are a popular style of wine produced in Canada. In the late 1940s, the grape was brought to Canada by Adhemar de Chaunac, a French enologist working for the Ontario wine producer T.G. Bright & Company (later known as Bright Wines and now part of Constellation Brands). De Chaunac was responsible for bringing many Vitis vinifera and hybrid varieties to Canada to see which grapes could grow well in the Canadian climate. Vidal Blanc was one of the varieties that de Chaunac experimented with late harvest and leaving the grapes on the vines well into winter. However, the style of ice wine that Vidal blanc would become associated with didn't become commercially popular in Canada till the 1980s. Viticulture Vidal blanc is a very winter-hardy variety, able to survive prolonged exposure to cold temperatures during the dormant winter season and produce viable secondary buds that will still yield a crop even after a late spring frost. It is a mid-ripening grape able to accumulate sufficient sugar levels to make dry wines but can also hang on the vine long in to the season to produce late-harvest and ice wine. While the vine has some resistance to downy mildew, it can be very susceptible to powdery mildew and coulure as well as anthracnose. The long grape bunches of small berries can also be prone to developing botrytis bunch rot. Wine regions Though Vidal blanc is no longer authorized in France or widely planted there, the grape has found success in North America where it is grown in many wine regions throughout Canada and the United States as well as Sweden.Blaxsta Wine \\"Our wines\\" Accessed: April 8th, 2013 =Canada= oak aged ice wine made from Vidal. First introduced to the country in the 1940s, Vidal blanc is widely grown throughout Canada with 777 hectares (1,920 acres) documented in 2008. In the 2019 VQA report, it was 7.6% of Canadian wine production with 471,981 bottles produced or 52,442 cases (9L). Most of the plantings are in the Ontario region, particularly the Niagara Peninsula, but the grape can also be found in British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Quebec. Here Vidal is used to produce wines of all sweetness styles but is particularly noted for the quality of ice wines that can be made from the grape. Inniskillin, the world's largest producer of the ice wine style, makes ice wine from Vidal grapes grown in both Ontario and the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia. It is the only hybrid grape other than Marquette that qualifies for the highest classification of Vintners Quality Alliance (VQA) categories. =United States= While Vidal blanc is also used for ice wine production in the United States (particularly in the Finger Lakes region of New York and the Old Mission Peninsula AVA around Lake Michigan), it is more often used in the United States to produce dry or slightly sweet table wines. It is widely planted throughout the country, particularly in the east coast (Virginia and New York), Great Lakes region (Ohio, Michigan and Indiana) and Midwest (Missouri in the Augusta and Hermann AVAs). In 2010, there were 150 acres (61 hectares) of Vidal blanc planted in Virginia in regions such as the Monticello AVA. Michigan had 145 acres (59 ha) reported in 2006. In Indiana, there were 35 acres (14 ha) of the grape in 2009 with Illinois reporting 32 acres (13 ha) that same year mostly in the Shawnee Hills AVA. In 2009, Vidal blanc represented more than 7% of all grape plantings in the state of Missouri with 118 acres (48 ha). Other states growing Vidal blanc include Alabama, Arkansas (Ozark Mountain AVA), Connecticut (Western Connecticut Highlands AVA), Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland Catoctin AVA, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey (Outer Coastal Plain AVA), New Mexico (Middle Rio Grande Valley AVA), North Carolina (Yadkin Valley AVA), Ohio (Ohio River Valley AVA, Grand River Valley AVA and Isle St. George AVA), Pennsylvania (Lehigh Valley AVA and Lancaster Valley AVA), Rhode Island (Southeastern New England AVA), Tennessee, Vermont and West Virginia. Styles A Vidal ice wine made in Sweden. Vidal Blanc is noted for not having the characteristic \\"foxy\\" taste that it is identifiable with many hybrid-varieties which include American grapevines in their parentage. According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Vidal blanc tends to produce wines with \\"bright and pure\\" fruit and acid levels that can balance out the sweetness of ice wines though the wines tend not to have much aging potential. In comparing the ice wines made from Riesling to those of Vidal blanc, wine expert Oz Clarke also notes that Vidal wines tend not to have much aging potential but says that these wines usually have a rich concentration of intense fruit flavors.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 273 Harcourt Books 2001 In Missouri, dry styles of Vidal blanc are often full-bodied with a buttery mouthfeel that can be similar to Chardonnays that have gone through malolactic fermentation. The wine also tends to have noticeable acidity, similar to Seyval blanc, with well-made examples from favorable vintages tending to have a long finish.B. Durfur Exploring Missouri Wine Country pg 297 Pebble Publishing, Rocheport, MO 2007 In British Columbia, both dry and ice wine styles of Vidal blanc are marked by tropical aromas and strong fruity flavors.J. Schreiner The British Columbia Wine Companion pg 234 Orca Book Publishers (1996) Synonyms As a relatively recently produced hybrid variety, Vidal blanc has not been known under many synonyms with the only synonym recognized by the Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) being Vidal 256.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Vidal Accessed: April 8th, 2013 References Category:White wine grape varieties Category:Hybrid grape varieties Category:Canadian wine Category:American wine ","title":"Vidal blanc"},{"id":"2451115","text":"Flight of the Eagle () is a Swedish biographical drama film which was released to cinemas in Sweden on 26 August 1982, directed by Jan Troell, based on Per Olof Sundman's 1967 novelization of the true story of S. A. Andr√©e's Arctic balloon expedition of 1897, an ill-fated effort to reach the North Pole in which all three expedition members perished. The film stars Max von Sydow as S.A. Andr√©e, Sverre Anker Ousdal as Knut Fr√¶nkel and G√∂ran Stangertz as Nils Strindberg. Dutch-Swedish songwriter Cornelis Vreeswijk plays the role of the journalist Lundstr√∂m. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 55th Academy Awards. Many sequences from the film were used in the 1997 documentary A Frozen Dream (En frusen dr√∂m), also directed by Troell.

Troell was at the time in the post-production process of his film Bang!, and when Bang! was selected for the 1977 Cannes Film Festival, the plan was to use the festival to attract investors. However, Bang! was poorly received and the interest faded even from the Swedish Film Institute. The project was put on hold and Troell went to the United States to direct Hurricane, an assignment he was offered after the previous director Roman Polanski had suddenly left the country to avoid sentencing for unlawful sexual intercourse with a thirteen-year-old in Los Angeles.Press reaction and comments at the Swedish Film Institute When Troell returned to Sweden, and the film institute had gotten J√∂rn Donner as its new managing director, the project was revived. In May 1979 the new writing process started, this time led by Georg Oddner and Klaus Rifbjerg, with Donner himself as producer. The financing was difficult, not least because it coincided with the making of Fanny and Alexander, at the time the most expensive Swedish film ever made. However, Troell said he regarded all the film's expensive visuals as \\"background\\", and that \\"What excited me was the tragic quest and the characters of Andr√©e and his comrades. Release The film premiered on 26 August 1982 in Gr√§nna, the hometown of Andr√©e.The Swedish Film Institute - Visningar It was entered into the 1982 Venice Film Festival, where Max von Sydow won the Pasinetti Award for Best Actor. A VHS version was released in Sweden in November 2000. Distributor Studio S released a blu-ray edition, with Swedish and English subtitles, on 9 October 2017. Critical reception The Swedish critics were generally very positive about the film. It was praised for its attention to detail and how complete it felt in a review in G√∂teborgs- Posten by Monika Tunb√§ck-Hanson: \\"It is the overall approach and the firm hand that contemporary Swedish films so often lack. Jan Troell lacks neither.\\" Hans Erik Hjert√©n at Dagens Nyheter made a comparison to Troell's previous films: \\"The smallness of the humans, ripped from the larger community, is cleverly demonstrated by Troell by letting Strindberg at a distance cover his comrades with a single finger! In such details, the storyteller Troell has always had his strength and has it here too, but he is more restrained than before, it appears to me. Here is not the same profusion of lyrical whims as in previous films.\\" Internationally the film was also well received. Vincent Canby expressed in a review for The New York Times how he would like to know more about which parts of the story that were derived directly from Andr√©e's journal and which were speculation. He further wrote that the film \\"leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Yet the adventure is both panoramic and unusually intimate. Toward the end of the expedition, the personal drama of the three men, as they are overtaken by fate, is detailed with an intensity that is as moving as the earlier sequences are spectacular.\\"Canby, Vincent (1983-04-08) \\"SWEDEN'S 'FLIGHT OF THE EAGLE'.\\" The New York Times.

The hereby article also focuses on the local breweries and craft beers. Overview Turda old beer factory situated in Turda, Cluj County, Transylvania. A national association of beer with mititei came into existence during the 1877 Independence War of Romania and after that it saw a spread of beer pubs throughout the Romanian Kingdom. The beer pubs (berƒÉrii) became a place of social and business meetings for the Romanian urban middle-class. Currently, Romanians are amongst the heaviest beer drinkers in the world, with an annual consumption of over 100 litres per capita in 2007. Romanian law considers beer and wine to be foodstuffs and therefore they are not subject to the usual tariffs and restrictions imposed upon alcoholic beverages. The word \\"beer\\" in Romanian (bere) is derived from German Bier (itself an early loan from Latin biber), but there is also an obsolete regional word \\"olovinƒÉ\\", of Nordic origin (ole; ) and related to ale. Brands Some of the most commercially consumed Romanian beers are: Ursus (Latin for \\"bear\\"), Timi»ôoreana (named after the city of Timi»ôoara), Stejar (Romanian for \\"oak\\") - all owned by Asahi, Bergenbier - owned by Molson Coors, Ciuc (named after Miercurea Ciuc) and Silva (Latin for \\"forest\\") - owned by Heineken. Silva and Ursus have also a dark lager variety. Some international brands are brewed locally, being very popular but sometimes more expensive than the traditional ones: Heineken, Carlsberg, Stella Artois, Beck's, Tuborg, Holsten, Peroni, Staropramen and Skol. Also, there are a large number of beers usually sold in 2-liter PET bottles and targeting the low-end market. Examples are: Ciuca≈ü, Golden Brau, B√ºrger, Neumarkt, Bucegi, Gambrinus, Azuga, Noroc, Albacher. Breweries The largest brewing companies in Romania are Ursus Breweries, owned by Asahi Group Holdings, Ltd., which has three breweries, in Bra≈üov, BuzƒÉu and Timi»ôoara, and Heineken Romania (previously called Brau Union Romania), which also has four breweries, in Constan≈£a, Craiova, Miercurea Ciuc and T√¢rgu Mure≈ü. Other major companies are Bergenbier, owned by Molson Coors, which has facilities in Blaj and Ploie≈üti, and Tuborg Romania (officially called United Romanian Breweries), part of the Carlsberg Group, which has a brewery in Pantelimon. Other national companies are European Drinks, which owns a brewery in Sudrigiu, Romaqua Group, which owns a brewery near Alba Iulia., Albrau, located in One≈üti, which produces its own beer brands, as well as dedicated brands for supermarket or hypermarket chains. and Martens (the former Robbere brewery) Gala≈£i, owned by Bierbrouwerij Martens from Belgium since 1998, which also produces both dedicated beer brands and its own brands. Two other smaller companies which are operating mainly regional are Bermas, based in Suceava, and Imex, located in Satu Mare. The Imex brewery facility has been taken over by Sam Mills and since 2016 brews Samburger beer.Portalsm.ro - O nouƒÉ marcƒÉ de bere lansatƒÉ la Satu Mare. Cine o produce Romanian craft beer Wicked Barrel & Bereta, The Black Pot In Timi»ôoara there is the microbrewery Clinica de Bere with their main brand Terapia since 2011. In 2013 Alexandru GeamƒÉnu and Lauren»õiu BƒÉnescu started the micro-brewery Fabrica de Bere BunƒÉ (Factory of Good Beer) with their main brand ZƒÉganu in MƒÉneciu-Ungureni.

In 2013 Leonard Mihoc started his brewery Nem≈£eana in Roman. In April 2015 the brothers Alin and RƒÉzvan Matache opened a microbrewery in Bucharest and began brewing different types of ales. Their main brand is Ground Zero Beer.groundzerobeer.ro Founded in 2016 in Jilava, Hop Hooligans brewery quickly rose popularity with bold collaborations and an ever-changing range of new beers. They are also among the few independent brewers that drew some international interest. As of 2019 they have participated in numerous craft beer Festivals and tap take overs across Europe. In February 2017, gypsy brewers Wicked Barrel began their activity. Their debut beer ‚Äì an imperial stout brewed in collaboration with Bereta called The Black Pot ‚Äì shot to the number one spot in Romania on RateBeer.com in its first week of sales. In 2018 Wicked Barrel was declared 2nd Best New Brewery in the World at RateBeer Best Awards from a total of +6400 breweries. The craft beer industry has seen exponential growth since 2015, currently at around 50 breweries with a yearly output of under 5000 hectoliters. To keep up with the growth, a series of online resources is now available, such as Universitatea de Bere posting regular beer reviews and podcasts, or Beerologique, the Romanian craft beer database, targeting an international audience and keeping track of each and every brewery in the country.

It then continues by forecasting the positions of China, Japan, the European Economic Community (EEC), the Soviet Union and the United States through the end of the 20th century. Summary Kennedy argues that the strength of a Great Power can be properly measured only relative to other powers, and he provides a straightforward and persuasively argued thesis: Great Power ascendancy (over the long term or in specific conflicts) correlates strongly to available resources and economic durability; military overstretch and a concomitant relative decline are the consistent threats facing powers whose ambitions and security requirements are greater than their resource base can provide for.Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000, New York, Vintage Books, 1987, , pp. 438‚Äì39. Throughout the book he reiterates his early statement (page 71): \\"Military and naval endeavors may not always have been the raison d'√™tre of the new nations-states, but it certainly was their most expensive and pressing activity\\", and it remains such until the power's decline. He concludes that declining countries can experience greater difficulties in balancing their preferences for guns, butter and investments.Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, p. 535. Kennedy states his theory in the second paragraph of the introduction as follows: :The \\"military conflict\\" referred to in the book's subtitle is therefore always examined in the context of \\"economic change.\\" The triumph of any one Great Power in this period, or the collapse of another, has usually been the consequence of lengthy fighting by its armed forces; but it has also been the consequences of the more or less efficient utilization of the state's productive economic resources in wartime, and, further in the background, of the way in which that state's economy had been rising or falling, relative to the other leading nations, in the decades preceding the actual conflict. For that reason, how a Great Power's position steadily alters in peacetime, is as important to this study as how it fights in wartime.Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, p. xv. Kennedy adds on the same page: :The relative strengths of the leading nations in world affairs never remain constant, principally because of the uneven rate of growth among different societies and of the technological and organizational breakthroughs which bring a greater advantage to one society than to another.Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, p. xv. =Early modern era= The book starts at the dividing line between the Renaissance and early modern history‚Äî1500 (Chapter 1). It briefly discusses the Ming (page 4) and Muslim worlds (page 9) of the time and the rise of the western powers relative to them (page 16). The book then proceeds chronologically, looking at each of the power shifts over time and the effect on other Great Powers and the \\"Middle Powers\\". Kennedy uses a number of measures to indicate real, relative and potential strength of nations throughout the book. He changes the metric of power based on the point in time. Chapter 2, \\"The Habsburg Bid for Mastery, 1519‚Äì1659\\" emphasizes the role of the \\"manpower revolution\\" in changing the way Europeans fought wars (see military revolution). This chapter also emphasizes the importance of Europe's political boundaries in shaping a political balance of power. :\\"The argument in this chapter is not, therefore, that the Habsburgs failed utterly to do what other powers achieved so brilliantly. There are no stunning contrasts in evidence here; success and failure are to be measured by very narrow differences. All states, even the United Provinces, were placed under severe strain by the constant drain of resources for military and naval campaigns... The victory of the anti-Habsburg forces was, then, a marginal and relative one. They had managed, but only just, to maintain the balance between their material base and their military power better than their Habsburg opponents.\\" (page 72) =European imperialism= The Habsburg failure segues into the thesis of Chapter 3, that financial power reigned between 1660 and 1815, using Britain, France, Prussia, Austria-Hungary, and Russia to contrast between powers that could finance their wars (Britain and France) and powers that needed financial patronage to mobilize and maintain a major military force on the field. Kennedy presents a table (page 81, Table 2) of \\"British Wartime Expenditures and Revenue\\"; between 1688 and 1815 is especially illustrative, showing that Britain was able to maintain loans at around one- third of British wartime expenditures throughout that period * Total Wartime Expenditures, 1688‚Äì1815: 2,293,483,437 Pounds, * Total Income: 1,622,924,377 Pounds, * Balance Raised by Loans: 670,559,060 Pounds, and * Loans as % of Expenditure: 33.3% The chapter also argues that British financial strength was the single most decisive factor in its victories over France during the 18th century. This chapter ends on the Napoleonic Wars and the fusion of British financial strength with a newfound industrial strength. =Industrial Revolution= Kennedy's next two chapters depend greatly upon Bairoch's calculations of industrialization, measuring all nations by an index, where 100 is the British per capita industrialization rate in 1900. The United Kingdom grows from 10 in 1750, to 16 in 1800, 25 in 1830, 64 in 1860, 87 in 1880, to 100 in 1900 (page 149). In contrast, France's per capita industrialization was 9 in 1750, 9 in 1800, 12 in 1830, 20 in 1860, 28 in 1880, and 39 in 1900. Relative shares of world manufacturing output (also first appearing on page 149) are used to estimate the peaks and troughs of power for major states. China, for example, begins with 32.8% of global manufacturing in 1750 and plummets after the First Opium War, Second Opium War and Taiping Rebellion to 19.7% of global manufacturing in 1860, and 12.5% in 1880 (compared to the UK's 1.9% in 1750, growing to 19.9% in 1860, and 22.9% in 1880). =20th century= Measures of strength in the 20th century (pages 199‚Äì203) use population size, urbanization rates, Bairoch's per capita levels of industrialization, iron and steel production, energy consumption (measured in millions of metric tons of coal equivalent), and total industrial output of the powers (measured against Britain's 1900 figure of 100), to gauge the strength of the various great powers. Kennedy also emphasizes productivity increase, based on systematic interventions, which led to economic growth and prosperity for great powers in the 20th century. He compares the great powers at the close of the 20th century and predicts the decline of the Soviet Union, the rise of China and Japan, the struggles and potential for the European Economic Community (EEC), and the relative decline of the United States. He highlights the precedent of the \\"Four Modernizations\\" in Deng Xiaoping's plans for China‚Äîagriculture, industry, science and military‚Äîde-emphasizing military, while the United States and Soviet Union are emphasizing it. He predicts that continued deficit spending, especially on military build-up, will be the single most important reason for decline of any great power. =The United States= From the Civil War to the first half of the 20th century, the United States' economy benefited from high agricultural production, plentiful raw materials, technological advancements and financial inflows. During this time the U.S. did not have to contend with foreign dangers.Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, p. 242. From 1860 to 1914, U.S. exports increased sevenfold, resulting in huge trade surpluses.Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, p. 245. By 1945 the U.S. both enjoyed high productivity and was the only major industrialized nation intact after World War II. From the 1960s onward, the U.S. saw a relative decline in its share of world production and trade.Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, p. 432. By the 1980s, the U.S. experienced declining exports of agricultural and manufactured goods. In the space of a few years, the U.S. went from being the largest creditor to the largest debtor nation.Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, p. 526. At the same time, the federal debt was growing at an increasing pace.Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, p. 527. This situation is typical of declining hegemons.Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, p. 529. The United States has the typical problems of a great power, which include balancing guns and butter and investments for economic growth.Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, p. 535. The U.S.' growing military commitment to every continent (other than Antarctica) and the growing cost of military hardware severely limit available options.Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, p. 514. Kennedy compares the U.S.' situation to Great Britain's prior to World War I. He comments that the map of U.S. bases is similar to Great Britain's before World War I.Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, p. 519. As military expenses grow, this reduces investments in economic growth, which eventually \\"leads to the downward spiral of slower growth, heavier taxes, deepening domestic splits over spending priorities, and weakening capacity to bear the burdens of defense.\\"Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, p. 533. Kennedy's advice is as follows: :The task facing American statesmen over the next decades, therefore, is to recognize that broad trends are under way, and that there is a need to \\"manage\\" affairs so that the relative erosion of the United States' position takes place slowly and smoothly, and is not accelerated by policies which bring merely short-term advantage but longer-term disadvantage.Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, p. 534 Table of contents * Strategy and Economics in the Preindustrial World **The Rise of the Western World **The Habsburg Bid for Mastery, 1519-1659 **Finance, Geography, and the Winning of Wars, 1660-1815 * Strategy and Economics in the Industrial Era **Industrialization and the Shifting Global Balances, 1815-1885 **The Coming of a Bipolar World and the Crisis of the \\"Middle Powers\\": Part One, 1885-1918 **The Coming of a Bipolar World and the Crisis of the \\"Middle Powers\\": Part Two, 1919-1942 * Strategy and Economics Today and Tomorrow **Stability and Change in a Bipolar World, 1943-1980 **To the Twenty-first Century =Maps, tables and charts= The book has twelve maps, forty-nine tables and three charts to assist the reader in understanding the text.

Lanterne is a French word designating a lantern or lamp post. The word, or the slogan \\"√Ä la lanterne!\\" (in English: To the Lamp Post!) gained special meaning and status in Paris and France during the early phase of the French Revolution, from the summer of 1789. Lamp posts served as an instrument to mobs to perform extemporised lynchings and executions in the streets of Paris during the revolution when the people of Paris occasionally hanged officials and aristocrats from the lamp posts. The English equivalent would be \\"String Them Up!\\" (British) or \\"Hang 'Em High!\\"(American) La Lanterne became a symbol of popular or street justice in revolutionary France. The slogan \\"√Ä la lanterne!\\" is referred to in such emblematic songs as √áa Ira (\\"les aristocrates √† la lanterne!\\" means \\"aristocrats to the lamp-post!\\" in this context). Journalist Camille Desmoulins, who had earlier practiced law, designated himself \\"The Lantern Attorney.\\" He wrote a pamphlet entitled (in translation) \\"The Lamp Post Speaks to Parisians,\\" in which \\"la lant√®rne\\" tells the people, \\"I've always been here. You could have been using me all along!\\". As the revolutionary government became established, lamp posts were no longer needed as execution instruments, being replaced by the guillotine which became infamous in Paris during 1793-1794, though all major French cities had their own. Hanging people from lamp posts ceased to be a part of Paris rebellions in the 19th Century.Camille Desmoulins as \\"Lantern Attorney\\", L'Oeuvres In√©dits de Camille Desmoulins and any reputable English-language source on The French Revolution. Though the tradition continued in symbolic form up to the twentieth and twentyfirst centuries, via the ritual hanging in effigy of unpopular political figures during street protests.  History  Joseph Foullon de Dou√©, the first victim of lynching \\"√† la lanterne\\" The first prominent victim of lynching \\"√† la lanterne\\" was Joseph Foullon de Dou√©, an unpopular politician who replaced Jacques Necker as a Controller-General of Finances in 1789. On 22 July 1789, the mob attempted to hang him on a lamp post, however, after the rope broke, he was beheaded and radicals marched with his head on a pike through the streets. \\"If [the people] are hungry, let them eat grass,\\" he is said to have once proclaimed, although the claim is unsubstantiated. Because Foulon, an aristocrat administrator of the royal government, was in charge of the Paris markets. Foulon was known for his coldheartedness towards the needs of the common French people; he was suspected of controlling Paris' food supply and, thereby, keeping food prices unaffordable. So hated that he had even staged his own funeral to escape the people's wrath, the 74-year-old Foulon had spent years growing rich at his post while the poor starved. On 22 July 1789, he was captured by an angry Paris crowd, who stuffed Foulon's mouth with grass, then summarily hanged him from the boom of a lamp post at The Place de Gr√®ve, in front of the town hall (L'H√¥tel de Ville). But the rope broke, and Foulon was hanged again and again before he was dropped to the ground and decapitated. His head, its mouth still full of grass, was placed on a pike‚Äîa long, sharpened, wooden pole‚Äîand paraded through the streets. Later that day, Foulon's son-in-law, Louis B√©nigne Fran√ßois Bertier de Sauvigny, was taken to the Place de Gr√®ve and hanged there, from the lamp post. De Sauvigny's severed head was placed on a pike of its own. Those bearing the pikes put the two severed heads together and chanted, \\"Kiss Daddy!\\" Thompson, J. M., The French Revolution. Oxford, Basil Blackwell.1964 Immediately following the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 two of the invalids (veteran soldiers) forming part of the garrison of the fortress were hanged in the Place de Gr√®ve, although it is not recorded whether lanternes were used for the purpose.Simon Schama, page 404 Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution, Particularly the lamp post standing at the corner of the Place de Gr√®ve and the Rue de la Vannerie served as an improvised gallows. The reason for that was partly symbolic: the lantern was placed opposite the H√¥tel de Ville (Paris City Hall), directly under the bust of Louis XIV, so that \\"popular justice could take place right under the eyes of the king\\".Schivelbusch (1995), p. 103 In August 1789, journalist and politician Camille Desmoulins wrote his Discours de la lanterne aux Parisiens, a defense of lynchings in the streets of Paris. Desmoulins was nicknamed Procureur- g√©n√©ral de la lanterne (Attorney-General of the Lamp-post). On 21 October 1789, a hungry Parisian mob dragged Fran√ßois the Baker (Denis Fran√ßois) out of his shop and hanged him from a lamp post, apparently because he had no bread to sell. Street lynching, instigated by various factors, has gradually became an effective tool for the ends of the Jacobins. On 14 December 1790, the crowd hanged barrister Pascalis and chevalier de La Rochette from a lamp post in Aix-en-Provence. The advocates of street justice cried \\"√Ä la lanterne! √Ä la lanterne!\\" shortly before the lynching. On 20 June 1792, a mob broke into the Tuileries and threatened the queen Marie Antoinette. Her lady-in-waiting Jeanne-Louise-Henriette Campan reported that in the crowd \\"there was a model gallows, to which a dirty doll was suspended bearing the words \\"Marie- Antoinette a la lanterne\\" to represent her hanging\\".  Influences  In 1919, Max Pechstein, a German expressionist painter, created a poster for the magazine An die Lanterne (√Ä la lanterne). The poster depicts, among other things, a man hanging from a rope on a lamp post.

History xOSL is free software released under the GPL license. The project was actively developed by Geurt Vos between 1999 and 2001 and spanned four major revisions and two minor revisions after its initial creation. From its origin in xOSL version 1.0.0, xOSL underwent major changes in ver. 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2 and 1.1.3. These revisions were significant departures from one another, and introduced new features to the program. These features ranged from drastic user interface improvements to improved compatibility on diverse hardware platforms. xOSL ver. 1.1.4 and 1.1.5 only introduced improvements to existing functionality and repaired features that should have been functional in their predecessors. Although their improvements were subtle, they did serve to stabilize a developing protocol, and are the most polished revisions of the original to date. The project lapsed into a dormant state and was abandoned by its original developer from 2001-2007. xOSL remained available for download and use throughout this period. Survivability Despite the lack of active product development, an enthusiastic community of xOSL users began exchanging ideas and product results through the use of Yahoo! Groups and other support sites on the internet. These groups became the foundation of the 'xOSL Culture'. The xOSL groups assisted fellow members with advice and accomplishments through the use of xOSL. After the original xOSL web site expired it was mirrored in multiple locations by Filip Komar and Mikhail Ranish. Very few enhancements to the original product occurred during this time, most of them being fairly inconsequential. One such enhancement gave the user the ability to change wallpapers and the image displayed at startup, and like most other revisions, it did not add a great deal to the program in terms of core functionality. Other revisions included the translation of xOSL into several different languages, including German, Czech and French, among others. XOSL-OW XOSL- OW is an Open Watcom Port of XOSL. XOSL is developed by Geurt Vos using the Borland C++ 3.1 tool set while XOSL-OW is based on the Open Watcom version 1.8 tool set. The XOSL-OW Open Watcom Port allows for future development of XOSL using an Open Source development tool set. XOSL-OW has no new functionality compared to XOSL but it does give improved behavior on specific PC hardware. In fact stability issues with XOSL on some PC platforms have been the reason for porting XOSL to the Open Watcom tool set. Examples of stability issues on specific PC hardware are: * Launching the Ranish Partition Manager from within the XOSL boot manager (Ctrl-P) results in a non-responsive keyboard. * Booting into the Smart Boot Manager (used to support booting from CD/DVD) results in a non-responsive keyboard. * Booting into Linux using the XOSL boot manager is not successful because of a non-responsive keyboard after the XOSL boot manager hands over control to the Linux boot process. In XOSL-OW these stability issues have been solved by an improved A20 Line Switching algorithm and flushing the keyboard buffer before the XOSL boot manager hands over control to either the Ranish Partition manager, the Smart Boot Manager or the Operating System Bootloader. Compatible file-systems Currently xOSL is capable of booting operating systems from a variety of format types.

The title is taken from the name of the heroine of the frame tale, the daughter of the 17th-century Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. The work consists of four narrative poems with a connecting tale in prose. Overview The name Lalla Rookh or Lala-Rukh ( l√¢le rox), means \\"tulip- cheeked\\" and is an endearment frequently used in Persian poetry. Engaged to the young king of Bukhara, Lalla Rookh goes forth to meet him, but falls in love with Feramorz, a poet from her entourage. The bulk of the work consists of four interpolated tales sung by the poet: \\"The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan\\" (loosely based upon the story of Al-Muqanna), \\"Paradise and the Peri\\", \\"The Fire-Worshippers\\", and \\"The Light of the Harem\\". When Lalla Rookh enters the palace of her bridegroom she swoons away, but revives at the sound of a familiar voice. She awakes with rapture to find that the poet she loves is none other than the king to whom she is engaged. Adaptations Lalla Rookh was the basis of number of musical settings, including a cantata by Frederic Clay & W. G. Wills (1877) featuring the famous song I'll Sing Thee Songs of Araby .Michael Kilgariff (1998) Sing Us One of the Old Songs: A Guide to Popular Song 1860‚Äì1920 It is also the basis of the operas Lalla-R√ªkh, festival pageant (1821) by Gaspare Spontini, partly reworked into Nurmahal oder das Rosenfest von Caschmir (1822), Lalla-Roukh by F√©licien David (1862), Feramors by Anton Rubinstein (1863), and The Veiled Prophet by Charles Villiers Stanford (1879). One of the interpolated tales, Paradise and the Peri, was set as a choral-orchestral work by Robert Schumann (1843). Lines from the poem form the lyrics of the song \\"Bendemeer Stream\\".  Legacy  Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm (founded 1889), often known as \\"the Grotto\\", a social group with membership restricted to Master Masons, and its female auxiliary, the Daughters of Mokanna (founded 1919), also take their names from Thomas Moore's poem.

Written by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder and based on a story by Edwin Justus Mayer and Franz Schulz, the film is about an unemployed American showgirl stranded in Paris who is set up by a millionaire to break up his wife's affair with another man. In 2013, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot American showgirl Eve Peabody (Claudette Colbert) arrives in Paris from Monte Carlo during a rainstorm with nothing but her clothes (an evening gown). With no money and no place to stay, she persuades soft-hearted Hungarian taxi driver Tibor Czerny (Don Ameche) to drive her to nightclubs looking for a job in exchange for her doubling his fare. After an unsuccessful search, Tibor buys her dinner and offers to let her stay overnight at his apartment while he finishes his night shift. While attracted to Tibor, she slips away. Seeking shelter from the rain, Eve sneaks into a black tie classical concert. Without an admission card, she uses the pawn ticket for her suitcase. Stephanie (Hedda Hopper), the hostess, learns that an imposter got in using a pawn ticket, and interrupts the concert to ask if \\"Eve Peabody\\" is there. Eve tries to slip away, but is intercepted by Marcel Renaud (Rex O'Malley), who invites her to play bridge in another room. The other players are Madame Helene Flammarion (Mary Astor) and Jacques Picot (Francis Lederer), a wealthy ladies' man. Eve introduces herself as \\"Madame Czerny\\" and is partnered with Jacques. Helene's husband, Georges (John Barrymore), enters the room and notices the woman who left during the search for the gatecrasher. Pretending to recognize Eve as the wife of \\"Baron Czerny\\", he chats with her. When the game ends, Eve and Jacques owe their opponents a few thousand francs. Eve thinks she must try to pass an IOU, but discovers 10,000 francs in her purse. Jacques insists on escorting her back to the Ritz, where she claims she is staying. Eve is stunned to find a lavish suite reserved for her. Meanwhile, Tibor searches for her. He recruits his fellow taxi drivers by organizing a pool, where everyone puts in five francs and whoever finds Eve wins the money. The next morning, Eve awakens to find that \\"her\\" luggage has arrived: a set of expensive trunks containing a complete wardrobe. Her car and chauffeur are waiting outside. Eve is mystified and frightened until Georges arrives, her mysterious benefactor. He explains that Helene and Jacques think they are in love. Last night, he noticed that Jacques had eyes only for the \\"Baroness\\". George proposes that Eve encourage Jacques and break up his affair with Helene. Georges will pay her well if she succeeds, and Jacques might even marry her. He gives her an expense account of fifty thousand francs and invites her to the Flammarion estate in Versailles for a weekend house party. Jacques becomes thoroughly captivated by Eve. While driving to the party, the couple are spotted by one of the taxi drivers. He collects the prize money from Tibor, who cannot believe she is staying at the Ritz under his name. Meanwhile, Helene learns that Stefanie accused the wrong person of being the gatecrasher. Suspecting the \\"Baroness\\", Helene has Marcel retrieve Eve's suitcase. At the Flammarion estate, Eve and Jacques arrive together, much to Helene's jealousy. When Marcel arrives with the suitcase, they search its contents and find a photograph of some showgirls, one of whom looks like the \\"Baroness\\". Helene is about to expose Eve when \\"Baron Tibor Czerny\\" is announced. Tibor informs the hosts that he has come to be with his \\"wife\\". Later in private, Tibor professes his love for Eve, who hints that she feels the same way, but she is still determined to marry for money. The next morning, Eve suspects that Tibor is about to reveal his true identity, so she explains that the Czerny barons are prone to fits of delusional madness, a story confirmed by Georges. Tibor appears as a taxi driver, but the Flammarions simply humor him, and he walks away in anger. Jacques offers to help Eve get a divorce and then marry her. Eve appears in court for a sham divorce. Although Tibor is angry with her, he accepts payment from Georges to go along. During the proceedings, however, Tibor pretends to be insane, knowing that this will prevent a divorce under French law. Finally cured of her infatuation, Helene leaves arm-in-arm with Georges, while Tibor and Eve head to the marriage bureau‚Äîmuch to the surprise of the judge who just denied their divorce.

He was born in San Sebasti√°n, in a working-class family. Trained in San Sebasti√°n, Madrid and Leipzig; then in Berlin, where he preferred Friedrich Koch as composition teacher to Arnold Sch√∂nberg, whose theories he disliked. It was in Germany that he made his conducting debut, and the rostrum remained at the centre of his working life. His Leipzig concert works include the choral Suite vasca (1923); Dos apuntes Vascos (1925) and Symphonic Variations on a Basque Theme (1927); of later works the funeral march Gernika for chorus and orchestra (1966) is outstanding. The Siete Lieder, 1929 settings of Heinrich Heine for mezzo-soprano and orchestra, are perhaps the finest works he produced in Germany. Two short but powerful compositions for chorus and orchestra, Maite (‚ÄòOur Lady‚Äô, from the 1946 film Jai-Alai) and ¬°Ay, tierra vasca! (1956) retain their place in the hearts of his Basque countrymen. Katiuska (1931) was his stage debut, and the twenty or so zarzuelas which followed combine lyric fire and inimitable orchestration with an unfailing sense of theatre. Best-loved are his classic madrile√±o comedy La del manojo de rosas (1934) and the ‚Äúnautical romance‚Äù set on the Atlantic Coast La tabernera del puerto of 1936. Soroz√°bal‚Äôs liberal sympathies left him somewhat isolated after the Spanish Civil War, and many of his later zarzuelas were first seen outside the capital or in less prestigious Madrid theatres. They include the ambitious, allegorical romance Black, el payaso (1942) and the ski-sports musical Don Manolito (1943), both of which starred popular Basque soprano Pepita Embil. Soroz√°bal also wrote scores for non-musical films, notably the classic Spanish film Marcelino Pan y Vino (1955).

Design History  After gaining independence, the Polish Army was armed mainly with a mixture of Russian, Austrian and German rifles. French rifles also were brought to Poland by returning Blue Army soldiers. As a result, at the end of the Polish- Soviet War in 1921, the Polish army was armed with approximately 24 types of guns and 22 types of rifles, all firing different ammunition. Since such a combination of designs adversely affected training and logistics, work on one standard rifle was carried out starting in 1919. Initially, it was assumed that the Lebel would be adopted, but it was quickly rejected as an obsolete design. Later on, proposals for adoption as a standard rifle included the Mannlicher M1895 or Steyr M1912 Mauser. The situation changed when the Council of Ambassadors resolution of 10 March 1921 ordered the transfer to Poland of machinery, equipment, documentation, and large stocks of raw materials from the former Prussian Royal Arsenal in Danzig. During World War I, this factory produced the Gewehr 98, facilitating the choice of the Mauser 98 action as the basis for any new Polish military rifle. With the transfer of the machinery and equipment from Danzig, production of the Kb wz.98, the Polish copy of the standard Gewehr 98 started in Radom and Warsaw in 1922. In 1924, after approximately 22,000 rifles were manufactured, wz.98 production ended. The Kbk wz.29 carbine eventually started to replace the wz.98 rifles in 1930. As a result of changes in Polish military doctrine in the early thirties, the kbk wz.29 carbines did not meet the new requirements. As a result, in 1934 Poland decided to start production of an improved version of the wz.98 rifle, the wz.98a . The new rifle differed from its predecessor in that it had a new notch sight and possessed the improved bayonet attachment of the wz.29. Production started at the National Arms Factory in Radom in 1936; the two years' delay between adoption and the start of production was due to the need for finding an acceptable source of wood for the rifle stocks. Before the outbreak of war in 1939, they had managed to produce 44,500 wz.98a rifles. They were one of the basic armaments of the Polish army. Captured wz.98 rifles were also taken into service by the Wehrmacht as the Gewehr 299 (p).  Technical overview  The wz.98a rifle was mechanically identical to the German Gewehr 98 rifle. It was a bolt-action repeating rifle, using a rotating bolt turned 90 degrees to lock or unlock. Locking was by means of two locking lugs at the front of the bolt, with a safety lug at the rear. Ammunition was fed from a fixed double stack box magazine holding five rounds. The safety was mounted on the rear of the bolt assembly. The rifle was fitted with iron sights, a tapered front sight blade and a tangent-type rear sight with a V-shaped notch, graduated from 100 to 2000 meters in 100 meters increments. The rifle used the bayonets wz.22, wz.24, wz.25, wz.27, wz.28 or wz.29.  Bibliography  * Zbigniew Nail, Piotr Zarzycki, the Polish construction arms, SIGMA NOT 1993. * Roman Matuszewski, Ireneusz J.

An all-girl group, the band was formed by three friends in 1996. The early period saw drummers come and go, including Jon from The Krays. Wanting a regular drummer, they eventually recruited Gabrielle in 1999 to complete the line-up. In 1998, they were signed to Punk Core Records for the release of their debut EP, which sold in excess of 5,000 copies, a surprisingly high number for a band's debut EP, especially on vinyl format. After the release of their second EP, Annihilation, in 1999 singer Stephanie left the band to be replaced by JJ. JJ sang on their 2001 album Live Fast, Die Young. At that point, with original singer Stephanie out of the fold, the band decided to change their name to the 99's. JJ left the band shortly thereafter and was replaced by Jessica.

This phrase indicates that nature is a garment, or vesture, with which God invests himself so as to reveal and impart Himself to man.  Concept  The conceptualization of the living garment of God is distinguished from the Baruch Spinoza's notion of the natural world, which viewed God as identical with nature. The Faustian concept cites an Earth Spirit that creates all things that transpire in the temporal world and that these constitute the living garment of the Godhead. This suggests that God wears the garment but he does not create it.  Interpretations  Other authors also used the metaphor. For example, Thomas Carlyle drew from Goethe's idea and wrote about \\"the living garment of God\\" in his work, Sartor Resartus. He supported the view that God is not nature, which he described as the garment as well as \\"God-written Apocalypse\\". Carlyle, in his contemplation, was able to develop his so-called \\"philosophy of clothes\\", which treats all things visible - including heaven, Earth, and nature - as symbols or vestures and that they are bound to fade. The British physicist Oliver Lodge also likened the metaphor to his notion of the ether, which he said is an omnipresent medium and a primary instrument of the mind. For Lodge, the ether - within the scheme of physics - is key to achieving the goal of unity with God.

In practice, it usually relates to the issue of alcoholic beverage, marijuana sales, and now mask wearing. As described by an encyclopedia in 1907, local option is the \\"license granted to the inhabitants of a district to extinguish or reduce the sale of intoxicants in their midst.\\" A 1911 Encyclop√¶dia describes it as \\"specifically used in politics of the power given to the electorate of a particular district to choose whether licences for the sale of intoxicating liquor should be granted or not.\\" This form of \\"local option\\" has also been termed \\"local veto.\\" Local option regarding alcohol was first used in the temperance movement as a means to bring about prohibition gradually. In the 1830s, temperance activists mobilized to restrict licenses in towns and counties in New England. By the 1840s, temperance reformers demanded state laws to allow local voters to decide whether any liquor licenses would be issued in their localities. Some 12 states and territories had some form of the early local option laws by the late 1840s. Controversy over the measures gave rise to the first major confrontation in the United States over the propriety and the constitutionality of ballot-box legislation, or referendums. Opponents of local option, which included drinkers and liquor dealers, many of whom were immigrants, argued that local option authorized the \\"tyranny of the majority\\" and infringed upon the rights of the liquor-dealing and liquor-consuming minority. Local option, as a method of alcohol control, made a resurgence after the Civil War. The Anti-Saloon League initially decided to use local option as the mechanism to bring about nationwide prohibition. Its intent was to work across the country at the local level. In many instances, however, it was not the agenda. For instance, several wards in Ontario, Canada, passed local option but were vehemently against province-wide prohibition since they preferred to isolate alcohol sales, rather than ban them altogether. That is particularly evident in Toronto's Junction neighbourhood, part of which remained notoriously dry as late as 2000, the last area of Ontario to repeal prohibition. Following the repeal of federal Prohibition in the United States in 1933, some states chose to maintain prohibition within their own borders. Others chose to permit local option on the controversial issue. In the remainder of states, there was no prohibition. Overlying the patchwork of prohibition, many states (known as alcoholic beverage control states) decided to establish their own monopolies over the wholesaling and/or retailing of alcoholic beverages. Montgomery County, Maryland, for example, has used local option to establish its alcohol control monopoly within its borders.

Market abolitionists argue that markets are ethically abhorrent, antisocial and fundamentally incompatible with long term human and environmental survival. In large countries in the modern world, the only significant alternative to a market economy has been central planning as was practiced in the early Soviet Union and in the People's Republic of China before the 1990s. Other proposed alternatives to the market economy (participatory planning as proposed in the theory of participatory economics (parecon), an artificial market as proposed by advocates of Inclusive Democracy and the idea of substituting a gift economy for a commodity exchange) have not yet been tried on a large scale in the modern industrialized world. Nonetheless, alternative organizational methods have been implemented successfully during short periods of time, namely the early stages of the Russian Revolution before it was taken over by the Bolsheviks and the Spanish Revolution before it was crushed by the alliance of liberals and Marxist‚ÄìLeninists.  Proponents  Michael Albert, creator of Znet and co-creator of participatory economics, considers himself a market abolitionist and favors democratic participatory planning as a replacement. He and several colleagues, including Robin Hahnel have elaborated their theory of parecon in books, on ZNet and in Z Magazine. Notably, Noam Chomsky is one of those who have expressed the opinion that a truly free market (in the context of a sudden transition from the current system) would destroy the species as well as physical environment. He also favors a democratic participatory planning process as a replacement to the market.  Criticism  Economists such as Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek and Brink Lindsey argue that if the market is eliminated along with property, prices and wages, then the mode of information transmission is eliminated and what will result is a highly inefficient system for transmitting the value, supply, demand, of goods, services and resources, along with an elimination of the most efficient mode of market transactions.

Identifying attributes include a 98/05 style mast bayonet lug ending directly beneath the front sight and winged protective ears to either side of the front sight blade. Cavalry models featured a turned-down bolt handle, and early versions had a stacking hook near the end of the stock on the right side.  Design history  After regaining independence in 1918, the Polish Army was armed with weapons left over from the nations that occupied Poland during the Partition Era, including Russian M91 Mosin‚ÄìNagants, Austrian Steyr-Mannlichers, and German Gewehr 98s. French Berthiers and Lebels from the soldiers of the Blue Army were also on hand, as well as the Japanese Arisaka and guns from Great Britain such as the Lee‚ÄìEnfield. As a result, at the end of Polish-Soviet War in 1921, the Polish army was armed with approximately 24 types of guns and 22 rifles firing different ammunition. In an effort to reduce logistical difficulties, the Polish Army sought to adopt a single type of rifle. Conveniently, the Treaty of Versailles, having established the Free City of Danzig, gave the Polish Army access to the weapons-making facilities at the Danzig Arsenal, facilitating the choice of the Mauser 98 action as the basis for any new Polish military rifle. The Mauser was also arguably one of the best bolt- action rifles at the time and the best available to Poland. Production of the wz.98 began in July 1922, after the Danzig machinery was moved to Warsaw to create the National Rifle Factory in Radom. Two years later, production of the wz.98 rifles was stopped. The military sought to adopt an intermediate-length rifle, such as the Lee‚ÄìEnfield, M1903 Springfield, or the German Karabiner 98a based on analyses of combat experience in World War I and the Polish-Soviet War. Field use of the K98a rifles showed that the design was not fit for use as an infantry weapon (originally, the K98a had been developed as a weapon for auxiliary or special troops). The greatest flaw was the weak bayonet mount, as the bayonet lug would break off when hitting hard objects. The K98a also used a small-ring Mauser action, which complicated the production process. Following the postwar shift to large-ring carbines with 600 mm barrels and Gewehr 98-style bayonet lug/muzzle lengths, such as the Czech vz. 24, the decision was made to develop an intermediate model rifle for the Polish Army. The design was finalized in 1929. The new wz.29 rifle was based on the old wz.98 rifle, but with a shortened stock and barrel, stronger alloys for the receiver and barrel, a reinforced chamber, and increased dimensional tolerance in the action, allowing for easy interchangeability of parts. There were two versions of the rifle: Infantry models had straight bolt handles, while cavalry models had curved handles. Since both variations used the same stock, cavalry models had a cutout in the stock for the curved handle. Production of the new weapons began in 1930 at the National Arms Factory in Radom. Despite the production of wz. 98a long rifles beginning in 1936, wz.29 production continued until September 1939, with a total of approximately 264,000 rifles produced, including rifles produced for export to Spain and Afghanistan. During the September Campaign, wz.29 rifles were used by the Polish Army in the defense of Poland, against German troops using the similar Karabiner 98k. After the defeat of Poland, they were used by the guerrillas of the Polish Underground. Captured wz.29 rifles were also used by the Wehrmacht as the Gewehr 298 (p).  Technical overview  Carbine wz.29 was a bolt-action rifle, with typical Mauser-action lock, with two large main lugs at the bolt head and a third safety lug at the rear. Ammunition was fed from a fixed two- row box magazine holding five rounds. A three-position safety catch was attached at the rear of the bolt, securing the firing pin. The sights consisted of an open post-type front sight, and a tangent-type rear sight with a V-shaped rear notch; the rear sight was a rear tangent sight that was graduated from 100 to 2000 meters at 100-meter intervals. The weapon was equipped with a knife-type bayonet wz.29.  Gewehr 29/40  This model was a clone of the Karabiner 98k built at the Radom factory for Germany. The Austrian firm Steyr was given control of the factory and they produced rifles for the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe. The name is a mixture of the German word for rifle gewehr, the last two digits of the Polish model number 29, and the last two digits of the year it was placed in production for the Germans 40. These rifles can be identified by the stamp G 29/40 on their receiver. This model is also sometimes given the Fremdger√§t country designation(√∂) for √∂sterreichisch or Austria. The resulting designation would be Gewehr 29/40(√∂).

Luise Aston, or Louise Aston (26 November 181421 December 1871), was a German author and feminist, who championed the rights of women, and was known for dressing in male attire. She was an advocate of democracy, free love, and sexuality.  Biography  Louise Aston was the daughter of the theologian Johann Gottfried Hoche. She married Samuel Aston, a wealthy factory owner of English descent, in 1835. She was later to say that her father had forced her to marry. The spouses lived in Magdeburg, where she caused scandals in the local society. In 1839, was given a divorce in Berlin. The couple remarried and divorced a second time in 1844. After her second divorce she lived in Berlin with the poet Rudolf Gottschall, befriended Otto von Corvin and Max Stirner and walked around on the street smoking cigars dressed as a male. She was an atheist, a democrat, and a republican, and she criticized marriage. She also believed in love outside of marriage: as a woman was often forced to marry for money and she was economically dependent on her husband, she reasoned it was difficult to marry for love and to keep love in a marriage. Marriage under such circumstances was for these reasons a form of prostitution. The contemporary women's movement had similar views, but considered it dangerous to expose them for fear of being considered immoral. Aston was therefore criticized by both the women's movement and the conservative society for different reasons because of her view that it should be allowed to have a sexual love relationship without being married. She was called a whore, a shameless marriage broker, and a seductress by the press. She was watched by the secret police, who sent spies after her and read her letters. Finally, she was banished from Berlin in 1846 because her way of life was seen as threatening to conventional order: \\" I must leave Berlin within eight days because I have expressed and lived according to ideas who were dangerous for the conservative law and order.\\"Kyle & Krusenstjerna, page. 44. In 1848, she took part in the revolutionary wave in Germany. She served in the Freikorps in Schleswig during the war. She was active within the democracy movement. She started a paper, which was stopped by the censorship authorities. She was expelled again but returned with a false passport. In 1850, she married the doctor Eduard Meier, with whom she became very happy. They moved to Bremen. They were often harassed by the authorities as dangerous radicals. Aston was watched by the police, who sent agents to her home and read her letters. Different cities in Germany collaborated in these efforts. Her spouse was head doctor and was much harassed and fired several times because of his marriage. He was forced to guarantee that she would not meet his patients or live in his quarters; he was also accused of having allowed an unmarried pregnant woman to remain in his employ and of having given her his care. At one occasion, he asked them this directly: \\"Is this an attempt to separate me from my wife?\\" and was given the answer: \\"Yes, that is correct.\\"Kyle & Krusenstjerna, page. 47. The police agent reported that she had few female friends, but many male ones, who often visited her and \\"had the appearance of democrats.\\" She admitted to a police officer that she believed in democracy and republic: \\"At present, I view the cause of democracy to be lost. It would be madness to do anything now, but soon, there will be an opportunity to do so.\\"Kyle & Krusenstjerna, page. 46. Her spouse had a wild rose carved upon her grave stone, and at his own, wrote, \\"The one God gave a woman, was given a treasure.\\"  Quote  > \\"I have asked for permission to wear male attire so that I can hear the > lectures at the university. I do not believe in God and I smoke cigars. My > goal is to free the women even if it may cost me my heart's blood.

He was one of the most celebrated officials of Wu Zetian's reign.  Background  Di Renjie was born in Yangqu County, Bing Province in 630, during the reign of Emperor Taizong. His family, from Taiyuan, was one that had produced many officials. His grandfather Di Xiaoxu (ÁãÑÂ≠ùÁ∑í) served as Shangshu Zuo Cheng (Â∞öÊõ∏Â∑¶‰∏û), a secretary general of the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng), and his father Di Zhixun (ÁãÑÁü•ÈÅú) served as the prefect of Kui Prefecture (Â§îÂ∑û, modern eastern Chongqing). Di Renjie was known for being studious in his youth, and after passing the imperial examination served as a secretary at the prefectural government of Bian Prefecture (Ê±¥Â∑û, roughly modern Kaifeng, Henan). While serving there, he was falsely accused of improprieties by colleagues, and when the minister of public works, Yan Liben, was touring the Henan Circuit (Ê≤≥ÂçóÈÅì, the region immediately south of the Yellow River), which Bian Prefecture belonged to, he was asked to judge the case. After seeing Di, he was impressed by him, and commented, \\"Confucius had said, 'You can tell a man's kindness by his failure.' You are a pearl from the coast and a lost treasure of the southeast.\\" He recommended Di to become a bailiff for the commandant at Bing Prefecture (Âπ∂Â∑û, roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). While at Bing Prefecture, he was said to be caring of others. On one occasion, his colleague Zheng Chongzhi (ÈÑ≠Â¥áË≥™) was ordered to go on an official trip to a place far away. Di, noting that Zheng's mother was old and ill, went to the secretary general Lin Renji (Ëó∫‰ªÅÂü∫) and offered to go in Zheng's stead. It was said that Lin was so touched by the concern that Di showed Zheng as a colleague that he relayed the episode to the military advisor to the prefect, Li Xiaolian (ÊùéÂ≠ùÂªâ), with whom Lin had a running dispute, and offered peaceful relations to Li. By 676, during the reign of Emperor Taizong's son Emperor Gaozong, Di was serving as the secretary general at the supreme court (Â§ßÁêÜ‰∏û), and it was said that he was an efficient and fair judge, judging some 17,000 cases within a year without anyone complaining about the results. In 676, there was an event in which the general Quan Shancai (Ê¨äÂñÑÊâç) and the military officer Fan Huaiyi (ËåÉÊá∑Áæ©) accidentally cut cypresses on Emperor Taizong's tomb‚Äîan offense punishable by removal from office, but Emperor Gaozong ordered that the two be executed. Di pointed out that, by law, the two should not be executed. This initially offended Emperor Gaozong, who ordered Di to leave his presence. Di continued to object, and eventually, Emperor Gaozong relented and exiled them. Several days later, he appointed Di to the imperial censorate. Around 679, the minister of agriculture Wei Hongji (ÈüãÂºòÊ©ü) built three magnificent palaces around the eastern capital Luoyang‚ÄîSuyu Palace (ÂÆøÁæΩÂÆÆ), Gaoshan Palace (È´òÂ±±ÂÆÆ), and Shangyang Palace (‰∏äÈôΩÂÆÆ). Di submitted an accusation against Wei, arguing that he was leading Emperor Gaozong into being wasteful, and Wei was removed from his office. Meanwhile, around the same time, the official Wang Benli was said to be favored by Emperor Gaozong and, on account of that favor, was committing many illegal deeds and intimidating other officials. Di accused Wang of crimes; initially, Emperor Gaozong was set to pardon him. At Di's insistence‚Äîpointing out that the empire did not lack people with Wang's talent‚ÄîEmperor Gaozong relented and allowed Wang to be punished.  During Emperor Ruizong's first reign  As of 686, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong's son Emperor Ruizong, Di Renjie was serving as the prefect of Ning Prefecture (ÂØßÂ∑û, roughly modern Qingyang, Gansu). At that time, the censor Guo Han (ÈÉ≠Áø∞) was commissioned to tour the prefectures in the area, and wherever he went, he found faults with the prefects and corrected them, but when he arrived at Ning Prefecture, it was said that the people had no complaints about Di and praised him greatly. Guo recommended Di to Emperor Ruizong's mother and regent Empress Dowager Wu (later known as Wu Zetian), and Di was recalled to Luoyang to serve as deputy minister of public works (ÂÜ¨ÂÆò‰æçÈÉé, Dongguan Shilang). In 688, Di was touring the Jiangnan Circuit (Ê±üÂçóÈÅì, the region south of the Yangtze River). He believed that the region had too many temples dedicated to unusual deities, and at his request, some 1,700 temples were destroyed; only four kinds of temples were allowed to remain‚Äîthose dedicated to Yu the Great, Wu Taibo (Âê≥Â§™‰ºØ, the legendary founder of the Spring and Autumn period kingdom Wu), Wu Jizha (Âê≥Â≠£Êú≠, a well-regarded Wu prince and son of King Shoumeng of Wu), and Wu Zixu. Later in 688, in the aftermath of a failed rebellion by Emperor Gaozong's brother Li Zhen the Prince of Yue, then the prefect of Yu Prefecture (Ë±´Â∑û, roughly modern Zhumadian, Henan), against Empress Dowager Wu, she made Di, who was at that time Wenchang Zuo Cheng (ÊñáÊòåÂ∑¶‰∏û), a secretary general at the executive bureau (which by that point had been renamed Wenchang Tai (ÊñáÊòåËá∫)), the prefect of Yu Prefecture to succeed Li Zhen. At that time, some 600 to 700 households were accused of being complicit in Li Zhen's rebellion and were forced to serve as servants. At Di's request, they were relieved from those obligations, but were exiled to Feng Prefecture (Ë±êÂ∑û, roughly modern Bayan Nur, Inner Mongolia). Meanwhile, the general that Empress Dowager Wu sent to suppress Li Zhen's rebellion, the chancellor Zhang Guangfu, was still in Yu Prefecture, and his officers and soldiers were demanding all kinds of supplies from the Yu prefectural government, requests that Di mostly turned down. This led to an argument with Zhang, and Zhang accused him of showing contempt; in turn, Di angrily stated that Zhang was killing alleged coconspirators of Li Zhen excessively and that if he had the authority to do so, he would have beheaded Zhang even if it meant his own death. Zhang was greatly offended and, upon return to Luoyang, accused Di of contempt, and Empress Dowager Wu demoted Di to be the prefect of Fu Prefecture (Âæ©Â∑û, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). (This was considered a demotion as, while Di remained a prefect, Fu Prefecture was smaller and less important than Yu Prefecture.)  During Wu Zetian's reign  Di Renjie's tomb in White Horse Temple Inscription on tombstone: Tomb of Lord Di Renjie, famous chancellor of the Great Tang dynasty In 690, Empress Dowager Wu took the throne from Emperor Ruizong, establishing the Zhou Dynasty as its \\"emperor\\" and interrupting the Tang Dynasty. As of 691, Di was serving as the military advisor to the prefect of the capital prefecture Luo Prefecture (Ê¥õÂ∑û, i.e., Luoyang), when Wu Zetian promoted him to be the deputy minister of finance (Âú∞ÂÆò‰æçÈÉé, Diguan Shilang) and gave him the designation Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi (ÂêåÈ≥≥Èñ£È∏ûËá∫Âπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a 'de facto chancellor. She commented to him, \\"You did a good job in Ru'nan [(Ê±ùÂçó, i.e., Yu Prefecture)]. Do you want to know who spoke against you?\\" (Presumably, she was referring to Zhang Guangfu who, ironically, was executed by her in 689 on accusation that he had considered rebelling against her.) Di responded: Wu Zetian was impressed by the response and praised him. Later that year, when the imperial university's student Wang Xunzhi (ÁéãÂæ™‰πã) submitted a petition to Wu Zetian asking her to permit him to go on vacation, she was poised to issue an edict to approve of the request, when Di opposed the edict‚Äînot on the merits, but on the basis that university students' vacations were such minor events that she should not bother herself with them, but rather should order that such petitions be directed to the university secretaries. She agreed. In 692, Wu Zetian's secret police official Lai Junchen falsely accused Di, along with other chancellors Ren Zhigu, and Pei Xingben, along with other officials Cui Xuanli (Â¥îÂÆ£Á¶Æ), Lu Xian (ÁõßÁçª), Wei Yuanzhong, and Li Sizhen (ÊùéÂó£Áúü), of treason. Lai tried to induce them to confess by citing an imperial edict that stated that those who confessed would be spared their lives, and Di confessed and was not tortured‚Äîbut when Lai's subordinate Wang Deshou (ÁéãÂæ∑Â£Ω) tried to induce him to implicate another chancellor, Yang Zhirou, refused. Di then wrote a petition on his blanket and hid it inside cotton clothes, and then had his family members take the clothes home to be changed into summer clothes. Wu Zetian thereafter became suspicious and inquired with Lai, who responded by forging, in the names of Di and the other officials, submissions thanking Wu Zetian for preparing to execute them. However, the young son of another chancellor who had been executed, Le Sihui, who was seized to be a servant at the ministry of agriculture, made a petition to Wu Zetian and told her that Lai was so skillful at manufacturing charges that even the most honest and faithful individuals would be forced into confessions by Lai. Wu Zetian thereafter summoned the seven accused officials and personally interrogated them, and after they disavowed the forged confessions, released but exiled them‚Äîin Di's case, to be the magistrate of Pengze County (ÂΩ≠Êæ§, in modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi). In 696, during the middle of an attack by the Khitan khan Sun Wanrong against Zhou prefectures north of the Yellow River, Wu Zetian promoted Di to be the prefect of Wei Prefecture (È≠èÂ∑û, roughly modern Handan, Hebei). It was said that Di's predecessor Dugu Sizhuang (Áç®Â≠§ÊÄùËéä), in fear of a Khitan attack, had ordered the people of the prefecture to all move within the prefectural capital's walls, drawing much fear and resentment from the people. When Di arrived, he, judging the Khitan forces to be still far away, ordered that the people be allowed to return to their homes and farms, gaining much gratitude from the people. After Sun's forces collapsed in 697 after a surprise attack by the Eastern Tujue khan Ashina Mochuo against his home base, Wu Zetian had Di, the chancellor Lou Shide, and Wu Yizong (Ê≠¶ÊáøÂÆó) the Prince of Henan (a grandson of her uncle Wu Shiyi (Ê≠¶Â£´ÈÄ∏)) to tour the region north of the Yellow River to try to pacify the people. Later in 697, Di was serving as the commandant at You Prefecture (ÂπΩÂ∑û, roughly modern Beijing), when, at Lou's recommendation, Wu Zetian recalled him to Luoyang to serve as Luantai Shilang (È∏ûËá∫‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (È∏ûËá∫, Luantai), and again gave him the chancellor designation of Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi. He submitted a petition advocating that descendants of Western Tujue and Goguryeo rulers be found and be given their ancient lands, to help defend against Eastern Tujue and Tufan attacks‚Äîa petition that was not accepted but was said to be well regarded by other officials. At that time, Wu Zetian's son Li Dan (the former Emperor Ruizong) was crown prince, but Wu Zetian's nephews Wu Chengsi the Prince of Wei and Wu Sansi the Prince of Liang both had designs on the position, and repeatedly had their associates reason with Wu Zetian that there had never been an emperor who made someone of a different family name his heir. Di, on the other hand, repeatedly argued to her that it is more proper for her to make her son her heir, and that Li Dan's brother Li Zhe the Prince of Luling, himself a former emperor that Wu Zetian removed in 684, be recalled to the capital, a suggestion echoed by fellow chancellors Wang Fangqing and Wang Jishan, and Wu Zetian began to agree. On one occasion, Wu Zetian asked him, \\"Last night I dreamed of a large parrot that had two broken wings. What do you think it means?\\" Di responded: It was said that thereafter, Wu Zetian stopped considering Wu Chengsi or Wu Sansi as heir. Meanwhile, another close advisor of Wu Zetian's, Ji Xu, also persuaded Wu Zetian's lovers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong the merits of the proposal‚Äîpointing out that as things stood, after Wu Zetian's death, they would be hated and would suffer terrible fates. Wu Zetian finally agreed, and in spring 698 recalled Li Zhe to the capital. Li Dan subsequently offered to yield the crown prince position to Li Zhe, and Wu Zetian agreed and created Li Zhe crown prince, changing his name to Li Xian and then Wu Xian. She soon made Di Nayan (Á¥çË®Ä), the head of the examination bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor. Also in 698, Ashina Mochuo turned against Zhou and attacked Zhou's northern prefectures. Wu Zetian made Li Xian the nominal commanding general of the army against Eastern Tujue, but made Di the deputy commanding general and actually in charge of the army. Before Di's army could arrive, however, Ashina Mochuo completed his pillaging of the northern prefectures and withdrew; Di's army never engaged him. Wu Zetian subsequently commissioned Di to tour the prefectures to pacify the people, and he was said to have done so well, helping refugees to return to their home, transporting food supplies to places needing them, repairing the roads, and helping the poor. Fearful that other officials would trouble the people with demands for luxury items, he made a good example of eating unrefined foods and prohibiting harassment of the citizens. Meanwhile, though, he was said to have looked down on Lou, not realizing that Lou had been the one that had recommended that he be made chancellor, until Wu Zetian revealed to him that fact, causing him to be embarrassed. In 700, Wu Zetian made Di Neishi (ÂÖßÂè≤), the head of the legislative bureau (È≥≥Èñ£, Fengge) and a post also considered one for a chancellor. By this point, she was said to have respected him so greatly that she often just referred to him as Guolao (ÂúãËÄÅ, \\"the State Elder\\") without referring to him by name. It was said that, on account of his old age, he often offered to retire, and she repeatedly declined. Further, she stopped him from kneeling and bowing to her, stating, \\"When I see you kneeling, I feel the pain.\\" She also ordered that he not be required to rotate with other chancellors for night duty, warning the other chancellors not to bother Di unless there was something important. Di died in fall 700, and it was said that she wept bitterly, stating, \\"The Southern Palace [(i.e., the imperial administration)] is now empty.\\" Prior to his death, Di had recommended many capable officials, including Zhang Jianzhi, Yao Yuanchong, Huan Yanfan, and Jing Hui. As these officials were later instrumental in overthrowing Wu Zetian in 705 and returning Li Xian to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong), Di was often credited as having restored Tang by proxy. Di Renjie's tomb is located at the east end of the White Horse Temple in Luoyang, near the Qiyun Pagoda, on the tombstone engraved the inscription \\"The tomb of Lord Di Renjie, famous chancellor of the Great Tang dynasty\\".  In fiction  Di Renjie appears as the main character in a number of gong'an crime novels and films. The first of these stories, Di Gong An or Dee Goong An, (Chinese: ÁãÑÂÖ¨Ê°à) is an 18th-century Chinese detective novel written by the pseudonymous author ‰∏çÈ¢òÊí∞‰∫∫, loosely based on Di Renjie. Robert van Gulik translated the novel in the 1940s as Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee. He later wrote a series of detective novels featuring Judge Dee as the main protagonist. These in turn were the basis of a 1969 TV series in the UK starring Michael Goodliffe. Khigh Dhiegh appeared as the Judge Dee version of the character in the 1974 ABC TV movie Judge Dee and the Monastery Murders, based on Robert Van Gulik's novel The Haunted Monastery. It was directed by Jeremy Paul Kagan and the teleplay was written by Nicholas Meyer. Fr√©d√©ric Lenormand published 19 new novels using Judge Dee as detective from 2004 to present (√©ditions Fayard, Paris). In 2004, CCTV-8 aired a television series based on detective stories related to Di Renjie, under the title Amazing Detective Di Renjie (Á•ûÊé¢ÁãÑ‰ªÅÊù∞), starring Liang Guanhua as the titular protagonist. It was followed by three sequels: Amazing Detective Di Renjie 2 (2006), Amazing Detective Di Renjie 3 (2008), and Mad Detective Di Renjie (2010). Some characters in the television series are fictionalised versions of historical figures, including Wu Zetian and Di Renjie himself. The plot of each season is further divided into two or three parts, each covering one case. The story usually follows a pattern of a seemingly small case gradually leading to Di Renjie uncovering a sinister plot that threatens the Chinese empire. Kent Cheng portrayed Di Renjie in the 2009 Hong Kong television series The Greatness of a Hero produced by TVB. Andy Lau played Di Renjie in the 2010 film Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame directed by Tsui Hark. Bosco Wong portrayed a young Di Renjie in the 2014 Chinese television series Young Sherlock. Mark Chao portrayed Di Renjie in the 2013 Hong Kong movie \\"Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon\\" and its sequel \\"Detective Dee: The Four Heavenly Kings\\" (2018) both also directed by Tsui Hark. The two films are set as a prequel to the events in the Mystery of the Phantom Flame. In 2012, Bigben Interactive released a video game based on Di Renjie named Judge Dee: The City God Case. Initially released on PC, the casual hidden-object game later made it on to other platforms including Android and iOS. Nupixo Games released a new point-and-click adventure game featuring an original story which involves Empress Wu Zetian. Titled Detective Di: The Silk Rose Murders, it released in May 2019 for PC/Mac.  References  Further reading * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 202, 203, 204, 205, 206.

Bordering the county of Warwickshire, the village has a population of approximately 7,800 people, and is encompassed within the electoral ward of Dorridge and Hockley Heath, whose population stood at 11,140 as of the 2011 census. Location Dorridge is to the east of the M40 and the south of the M42 which, along with a small but important green belt area, separates Dorridge and its neighbours of Knowle and Bentley Heath from the greater urban area of Birmingham, with the town of Solihull encompassing the green-belt area. It falls in the Meriden Gap and historically was part of Warwickshire. Indeed, there are no major towns between Dorridge and Warwick. It is 125 metres (400 ft) above sea-level, located in the Midlands Plateau. Both Knowle and the sub-village of Bentley Heath are contiguous with Dorridge to the north and share its B93 postcode. History =Earliest existence= The village of Dorridge did not exist as a community until the mid-19th century, though it is mentioned as far back as the 15th century in the Westminster Muniments which recorded a place called 'Derrech'. It was just the name given to the ridge of land running westwards from Knowle (also then called 'Dorege'). The earliest evidence of settlement dates to the Bronze Age ‚Äì an axe dated to 1300 BC was found in Norton Green. Cottages dating back to the 16th century exist in Mill Pool Lane. However, the lack of any significant road system until the arrival of the railway showed that there was no community there. With the rise of Solihull, a road connecting to Hockley Heath became formed. Along this road, the Four Ashes (after which the recently developed estate was named) became a landmark ‚Äì records show the trees being present in 1662 and marking the Parish boundary. They were also mapped in 1725 even in preference to some local buildings of note. The ashes still exist today near to the driving range, though they have been replaced several times since the earliest records. The Drum and Monkey existed from around 1860, though then it was known as The White Lion Inn. =Impact of the railway= In 1852 the railway was built by the Great Western Railway, originally in Brunel's preferred 7-foot gauge track. Dorridge railway station, which was originally called Knowle, and later Knowle and Dorridge, created the focal point for a new community. The Muntz family granted the land for the railway on condition that a station was built ‚Äì perhaps less surprising on discovering that the Chairman of the Birmingham & Oxford Railway Company was P. H. Muntz, a relative. There is some folklore about the agreement that suggests that the railway was obliged to stop at Dorridge; however, with the affluent residents of Knowle and Dorridge, it was certainly a commercial practicality. Evidence of the popularity of the railway can be seen in that a \\"bus\\" service from the Greswolde Hotel in Knowle was provided in the early days of the railway at the cost of 6d. In its heyday, the train service ran between Lapworth and Birmingham with four tracks, but by the mid-1960s two tracks had been removed and traffic was declining. The link with London was revived in the 1990s as part of the privatisation of British Rail, initially with a single track running south of Banbury. Dual track working was reinstated and today in spite of being a village, Dorridge is still one of the stops on the express service. =Muntz family influence= The development of Dorridge is strongly linked to the Muntz family, who lived in nearby Umberslade Hall. The Muntz family were descendants of Philip Fredrick Muntz, an immigrant of the 18th century, who had left revolutionary France after settling there from Poland. Through industrial wealth, founded on a brass- making process for creating Muntz Metal, a form of brass used in shipbuilding, the family acquired a considerable estate in the area. Possibly the most famous of the Muntz family was the inventor of Muntz metal, George Frederic Muntz, who was also an early Member of Parliament for Birmingham. He was a supporter of political reform and a founding member of the Birmingham Political Union along with Thomas Attwood. In his actions that led to the Reform Act 1832 Muntz was indicted for sedition as he tried to undermine the Duke of Wellington with a run on gold ‚Äì To stop the Duke, run for Gold. He also was involved in a riot at St Martin's in Birmingham in protest against the Church Rates which were levied at around 6d to 9d in the pound. He was sent to trial in 1838 but was acquitted on all but one of 13 charges. Whilst claiming to be a Republican, his true character appeared to be that of an egotistical aristocrat. E. Edwards wrote in 1877 in the Birmingham Daily Mail of a conversation about a speech he made: \\"They won't be able to print Muntz's speech verbatim.\\" \\"Why not?\\" said I. \\"Why my dear fellow, no printing office in the world would have capital I's enough.\\" =Middlefield Hospital= Dorridge Grove, former public house and asylum. Dr Fletcher of Dorridge, together with Jonathan Henry Kimball of Knowle also provided for an 'Asylum for 20 Idiot Girls' in the mid-19th century, in 'Dorridge Grove' which was on the site of the former 'Royal Oak'; the building still exists as a distinctive house on Knowle Wood Road. The term 'idiot' was a specific term for those considered ineducable and was considered different from insanity. The records of the early years show that it was a successful enterprise, surprising those who visited that they achieved so much improvement in the behaviour of the patients. The demand for this facility was such that a purpose-built Idiot Asylum was then constructed in 1872 near Grove Road for ¬£10,000. The construction of this was something of a national event: representatives of 100 Masonic Lodges marched from Knowle Station to take part in the laying of the foundation stone, which was set in place using the same mallet used by King Charles the Second to lay the foundation stone of Saint Paul's Cathedral in London. The asylum was funded mainly by the local Counties of the Midlands, but George Fredrick Muntz sponsored competition with a prize of ¬£100 for the best design. It provided for housing idiot children from all over the Midlands. It is perhaps telling that in 1867 it was renamed to be the 'Midland Counties Middleclass Idiots Asylum' and although subsidised, families typically had to pay an annual fee to have their children placed there. This was extended in 1893 and evolved into the Middlefield Hospital which existed on the same site until the 1990s, having been adopted by the National Health Service in 1948. =Development of housing= Dorridge was not considered a district in its own right until 1940. Around the start of the 19th century, much of what is now Knowle Wood Road, (was then Packwood Road) was farmland with just a few dwellings, similarly Avenue Road (which was then Warwick Road) had a handful of dwellings. By the 1930s the main Dorridge Triangle was properly established. Aside from the substantial family homes, there are a significant number of mansions, some of which, such as Parkfield near the park, have now been converted into flats. During the 1930s, development slowed, and it was not until the 1950s that expansion gathered pace again. One of the earliest post-War developments was Kingscote Road, one of the few developments of semi-detached housing in the area, followed by the nearby Rodborough Road development in 1960. Art Deco house on Avenue Road. There was a substantial development in the 1960s around the area christened by estate agents as the \\"Golden Triangle\\" ‚Äì alluding to the expensive and desirable housing of the area bounded by Dorridge Road, Avenue Road and Knowle Wood Road. Even then the local press noted the high cost of housing, and that 2 and 3 car households were well above the national average. This area of housing has been noted as the most expensive in all of Dorridge and Knowle. This neighbourhood's proximity to the railway station has pushed property prices up much more than other areas of Dorridge. The population expanded rapidly: there were around 600 dwellings in 1955, which expanded to 1800 by the mid-1970s to somewhere above 2500 homes by the year 2000. Whilst there is a history of locals taking a dim view of developers, a local developer, Mr Ford, gave the land which is now Dorridge Park to the community in 1965. In the late 1990s another substantial development was built on former farmland in the area known as Four Ashes, behind the Porsche Centre Solihull, and the development of the Middlefield Hospital site occurred at a similar time. The architecture is a reflection of this development ‚Äî there are some fine buildings from the Victorian era all around the area. Over the years, each period has then added buildings of its style ‚Äî Avenue Road, for example, has classic Art Deco houses with rounded metal-framed windows. Building sizes were restricted in the post- war era. Buildings in the 1960s, though of limited architectural merit, were built with large gardens; many owners have since imposed character on these houses. More modern developments have seen the move to build apartment-style blocks, though there have also been substantial houses built, often on the site of much smaller houses and at the expense of the large gardens that still characterise the area. =Schools= The Infant and Junior schools today have over 750 pupils, until as recently as 1955 there were no schools in Dorridge, with pupils travelling to Bentley Heath, Hockley Heath, Knowle or Packwood to get an education. In 1955 Dorridge Junior School was built and by 1963 an Infant School was built. These were joined by the Catholic School of St. George and Teresa. The secondary education is mainly provided by Arden School in nearby Knowle, which now also has a sixth form centre. The sixth form buildings were completed in 2007 with additions being made every year. A considerable number of children go to private schools in Solihull, Warwick or Birmingham or to grammar schools in Birmingham or Stratford. =Commercial development= When coming to Dorridge today, a visitor would be surprised to know that there was significant activity in the area over the last hundred years. In Poplar Road, between the Station and the level crossing at Bentley Heath, a significant goods yard existed. During the 1960s and 1970s the Austin Motor Company used it to deliver up to 600 cars a day for export, via the railway. It has now been replaced with sheltered housing. A brickworks, the Knowle Brick Company, existed off Mill Lane with its own clay pit. The company ceased production in 1969, and whole the site was converted to housing in 1993 by Bloor Homes. The extent of the brickworks and pit site is the same as that now occupied by all the housing accessed via Oakhall Drive. A gasworks was developed on land that has now been developed into flats. Many of the buildings around the area that is now a Conservation Area ‚Äì Station Approach ‚Äì date back to around the start of the 20th century or before, though aside from the Forest Court shopping centre and the HSBC bank, now a caf√©, the centre is essentially unchanged from the mid-1950s. In 2008, Sainsbury's revealed that they had purchased a long lease to redevelop the Forest Court shopping centre and also owned part of the Station Approach Conservation Area which they intend to refurbish. An independent local group was formed in 2010 as a focus of opposition to any redevelopment of Forest Court which, it is argued, would be inappropriate in scale for the existing village centre. After some changes to the plans approval was given by Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council, and in the summer of 2013 Sainsbury's submitted an application to amend some details of the scheme. Dorridge today Clyde Road. The railway station is on the line between London and Birmingham.Chiltern Railways have created an inter-city route out of the run-down remnants of what had become primarily a goods line. A London Midland route now terminates in Dorridge or Leamington Spa, from Birmingham. Dorridge is neither urban nor a village. However, it sits right next to the Warwickshire countryside, with green fields being a short walk from the town centre. It has a small shopping centre, a village hall, at least three churches and a number of schools. It has a substantial park bordering the countryside. There are a few small restaurants, and three pubs. The property prices around Dorridge are the highest in the West Midlands region and also the highest in the entire English Midlands. In 2005, several houses sold for over ¬£1,000,000 according to the land registry. According to housing website Zoopla, the average house price in Dorridge in August 2020 was almost ¬£584,000, amongst the very highest in the UK outside of London. There are a number of notable residents who live here or very nearby, Jasper Carrott, The Office actress Lucy Davis, Sir Adrian Cadbury, Karren Brady former managing director of Birmingham City F.C, Steve Bruce, former manager of Birmingham City F.C, former England International Lee Hendrie, and Catriona Hamilton formerly lived here, alongside many other professional footballers and Musicians Bev Bevan, Harry Sutcliffe and Russell Leetch. Dorridge is part of the Meriden constituency, MP Caroline Spelman who also lives nearby, though is due to be split from Meriden under the current boundary review, forming a separate constituency of Dorridge and Kenilworth with the nearby castle town of Kenilworth. Community groups Aside from the strong church communities, the town benefits from a Round Table, a Residents' Association, a Neighbourhood Forum, drama groups and youth organisations including the strong Dorridge Scout Group. Some of the organisations are shared with Knowle, such as Knowle Sea Scout Group for young people aged 6 to 18. =Residents' Association= The Residents' Association was formed in 1961. It was formed in response to concerns over unwelcome developments and also helped develop facilities for local residents. In 1974, Dorridge Day was first held as a fundraising event for the Village Hall which was opened in 1976. The Dorridge & District Residents Association first ran the event, though in recent years, Knowle and Dorridge Round Table have run this popular annual fair. =Neighbourhood Forum= Knowle, Dorridge and Bentley Heath Neighbourhood Forum was formed in 2015 with the purpose of bringing together the people from the three adjoining villages to define how they would like to see the villages develop in the future. The Forum will collate the policies developed into a draft Neighbourhood Plan for the three villages during 2017, and subsequently arrange for a local referendum to create the Neighbourhood Plan as a statutory planning document for the area. The Forum is run entirely by volunteers, and by Spring 2017 had a membership of over 800. =Anglican Church= St Phillip's Church was built in 1878. =Catholic Church= Originally, the Catholic population had no formal meeting place but meet in Cross Close, a house in Arden Drive. In 1917 St George & St Teresa's church was built on Station Road. This burnt down in 1935 and was replaced with the substantial building on the same site, which still exists today. In 2006, a parish centre was added to the church, which was paid off in 2015. =Methodist Church= The Methodists put down their roots in 1958 with the arrival of their church in Mill Lane. =Baptist Church= In 1877, George Fredrick Muntz founded Christ Church Umberslade, a Baptist church off Spring Lane, Hockley Heath following his conversion to the Baptists cause. In later years, due to ill- health, he had a microphone system installed and linked to Umberslade Hall so he could hear the services. The church is now in the ownership of Historic Chapels Trust =Christadelphian Church= Knowle and Dorridge Christadelphians meet in Dorridge Village Hall on Sundays. =Round table= Knowle and Dorridge Round Table 812 was founded in 1963. For many years its regular meeting place was in Knowle, but the membership has always been drawn from the two communities. Whilst primarily a friendship organisation, it supports local charities, with the two main events it runs being Dorridge Day and the Christmas sleigh, visiting nearly every street in the area every December. =Dorridge Scout Group= Dorridge Scout Group was formed from the old 1st and 2nd Dorridge Scouts. Places of interest Nearby there are the historic buildings of Packwood House and Baddesley Clinton now in the care of the National Trust, and the Grand Union Canal is in walking distance with both the Heron's Nest and Black Boy pubs being accessible. The Stratford-upon-Avon Canal also links in and is notable for a large flight of locks that descend into nearby Lapworth from Birmingham. To the West, just across the M42, there is a nature reserve at Blythe Valley Business Park. The park is next to the River Blythe which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Footpaths run from Dorridge both to the Park and to Solihull's Brueton Park, the latter at times running alongside the River Blythe. Also to the West located along Four Ashes Road is Four Ashes Nurseries now run by the Sewell family for over 50 years but established by the Rodway family in the early 1920s and a golf driving range established in 1983, as well as the Drum and Monkey pub previously known as the White Lion Inn between the wars.

A handful of species are kept in the aquarium and are popular as small, peaceful, and colourful fish. The family includes about 370 species. They are generally small fish, with most species being less than , and are often brightly coloured. They are distinguished by their large mouths, and the division of the dorsal fin into two separate fins.

The suburb is divided into two areas: High Ford borders the estate of Pennywell. Low Ford, to the east, borders the suburb of Pallion. Much like the neighbouring estate of Pennywell, Ford Estate is currently undergoing large levels of urban regeneration with private housing now standing in the place of the homes people were forcibly evicted from. At the heart of the area once stood Ford Hall (after which the area is named), the childhood home of General Havelock, and a road is named after him near the site as well as a few public houses outside the suburb. The house was demolished in the middle of the twentieth century and was rebuilt as a retirement home. Most of the houses in Ford Estate were built in the 1930s and 1940s, and most of the street names begin with the letter F, and also contain the word ford in them, examples of this are Falmouth Road, Fordham Road, Fordfield Road and Falkland Road.

The later part of his term was marred by a succession of disputed convictions. Lane's critics claimed that his refusal to believe that police evidence could be institutionally corrupt, and his reluctance to overturn the verdict of a jury, \\"represented a dangerous hindrance to justice\\". His failure to allow the appeal of the Birmingham Six in 1988 led to calls for his resignation following their successful appeal in 1991; an editorial in The Times \\"urged him to go\\", while 140 members of parliament signed a House of Commons motion to that effect. Early life The son of a bank manager, Lane was born in Derby. He attended Shrewsbury School and Trinity College, Cambridge where he took Firsts in Part I of the Classical Tripos before the Second World War and both parts of the Law Tripos after he was demobilized. During the war, he served as a pilot in the Royal Air Force. Initially, he flew Wellington Bombers for 104 Squadron, before being promoted to Squadron Leader to command 233 Squadron, which flew Dakota transport aircraft in D-Day and Operation Market Garden. He was awarded the Air Force Cross in 1943. Legal career Lane was called to the bar at Gray's Inn in 1946. He specialised in criminal prosecutions on the Midland and Oxford circuit, and took silk in 1962. He prosecuted some of the Great Train robbers and the murderer James Hanratty in the same year, and was appointed as Recorder of Bedford in 1963. While appearing for the defendant in the case of R v Morris,R v Morris (1966, 2 QB 110) he made a much-cited statement as to what constituted 'common purpose' for the criminal law, which Lord Parker of Waddington CJ adopted: :\\"where two persons embark on a joint enterprise, each is liable for the acts done in pursuance of that joint enterprise, that that includes liability for unusual consequences if they arise from the execution of the agreed joint enterprise but (and this is the crux of the matter) that, if one of the adventurers goes beyond what had been tacitly agreed as part of the common enterprise, his co- adventurer is not liable for the consequences of that unauthorised act. Finally, he says it is for the jury in every case to decide whether what was done was part of the joint enterprise, or went beyond it and was in fact an act unauthorised by that joint enterprise.\\" He is also famous for his quote: \\"Loss of freedom seldom happens overnight. Oppression doesn't stand on the doorstep with toothbrush moustache and swastika armband ‚Äì it creeps up insidiously... step by step, and all of a sudden the unfortunate citizen realizes that it is gone.\\" Judicial office =High Court= Later in 1966, Lane was appointed a Justice of the High Court, assigned to the Queen's Bench Division, receiving the customary Knighthood. He was elected a Bencher at Gray's Inn the same year. He delivered some notable judgments: in 1968, he awarded damages against a school for a pupil who had been injured in 'horseplay' between his peers, saying that the school had a responsibility to stop it getting out of hand; and while acting as an appeal judge, he found for the publishers of Last Exit to Brooklyn who had been convicted of publishing an obscene book, because of faults in the trial Judge's summing-up. He was chosen to head the inquiry into the Staines air disaster in 1972, and concluded that the underlying cause was an undiagnosed heart condition of the pilot which impaired his judgement, coupled with the pilot's known bad temper which led to his junior crew being unwilling to challenge him. =Appellate courts= Lane was made a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1974. He was one of the appeal judges in Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council's appeal to keep its Grammar Schools rather than be forced by the government to adopt a comprehensive system, and joined in the judgment that found for Tameside and brought a halt to comprehensivisation. Lane's judgment was personally critical of Fred Mulley, the Secretary of State for Education and Science for being \\"far from frank\\" about his reason for intervening in Tameside. In another high-profile case in 1977, Lane joined in dismissing an appeal against deportation from Mark Hosenball, an American journalist working for the Evening Standard. In 1978, Lane found for the Labour Party and against its dissident members (Paul McCormick and Julian Lewis) who tried to win control of Newham North East Constituency Labour Party from the party's National Executive. Lane became a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary on 28 September 1979, receiving as a Law lord additionally a life peerage as Baron Lane, of St Ippollitts in the County of Hertfordshire. He had been appointed by the new Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham, soon after Margaret Thatcher won the 1979 general election. His appointment was welcomed in the legal profession, where Lane was regarded as a genial figure (\\"Geoffrey Dawson, Baron Lane. Good to have you back again.\\"Lane's entry in The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.), but eventually not welcomed by Lane himself, who disliked the work. The overdue retirement of Lord Widgery, whose physical ill-health and increasing dementia had become a suppressed scandal, led to Hailsham picking Lane to follow him as Lord Chief Justice from 1980. =Lord Chief Justice= Shortly after taking over as Lord Chief Justice, Lane attracted political controversy when he called for a general reduction in prison terms. His appeal judgments frequently cut the length of sentences and he was known to be a member of the Prison Reform Trust. He had served as deputy chairman of the Parole Board from 1970 to 1972. After the publication of lengthy interviews with members of the jury in the trial of Jeremy Thorpe, Lane supported moves (later made in the Contempt of Court Act 1981) to ban any publication of reports from within the jury room. Lane also opposed the proposal to extend rights of audience in the higher courts to solicitors. One of the areas of crime in which Lane did not support shorter sentences was rape. In 1982, Lane stated that sentences for rape should include immediate prison time, except in the most exceptional circumstances, which was taken as an implied rebuke for a Judge who had attracted controversy for fining a rapist ¬£2,000 and saying that the victim was \\"guilty of a great deal of contributory negligence\\". Lane made it clear he rejected the general concept that victims of rape could have given their attackers an excuse. Much later in his career, Lane was responsible for a judgment in the case of R v R which for the first time held that a husband could be guilty of raping his wife, overturning the irrebuttable presumption at common law that a wife consented to sex with her husband. Many observers regarded Lane as a defender of traditional 'Victorian' morality rather than a supporter of mild feminism. In 1983, he gave the Darwin Lecture at Cambridge, in which he stated that he believed that the word \\"gay\\" should not be used to mean homosexual, and that instead the term should be \\"homosexuals, and/or buggers\\". Disputed convictions Lane had an early introduction to controversies and disputed convictions when, in 1962, he was the junior Crown counsel in the trial of James Hanratty for the A6 murder. Hanratty was hanged but disputes over whether he was properly convicted have continued to this day. He also represented the Metropolitan Police at the Brabin inquiry into the conviction and subsequent hanging of Timothy Evans for the murders at 10 Rillington Place in 1950. From the mid-1980s, concern grew. On 5 December 1985, Lane quashed the conviction of Anthony Mycock who had been convicted of a robbery which the BBC television programme Rough Justice argued had never occurred. In his judgment, Lane asserted that there had been a robbery and criticised the programme for \\"outrageous\\" interview methods. He regarded such programmes as \\"mere entertainment\\". When the Birmingham Six were granted permission to appeal in 1987, Lane presided over what was (at six weeks) the longest criminal appeal in English legal history. The judgment, given on 28 January 1988, adopted all the key parts of the Crown case, dismissed defence witnesses as unreliable, and upheld the convictions. Lane concluded by sending a message to the Home Secretary: \\"As has happened before in References by the Home Secretary to this court, the longer this hearing has gone on the more convinced this court has become that the verdict of the jury was correct.\\" This implied rebuke and invitation not to refer any more questioned cases was criticised by campaigners. Lane initially refused leave to appeal to Winston Silcott, convicted of the murder of Keith Blakelock in the midst of a strong campaign of vilification from tabloid newspapers. In his findings he concluded that there was \\"no lurking doubt\\" in spite of the flimsiness of the prosecution case. Silcott's conviction for the Blakelock murder was ultimately quashed in 1991. Unfortunately for Lane, in 1989, the appeal of the Guildford Four proved police malpractice conclusively. In this case, Lane overturned the convictions. One observer described his appearance: \\"The Lord Chief Justice seemed to sniff something nasty in the air. Peering out over half-moon spectacles, Lord Lane's weary face was the mask of Justice embarrassed.\\" Lane refused to free Paul Hill, one of the Four, because of a separate conviction for murder in Northern Ireland, although this later turned out also to have been a wrongful conviction. The Birmingham Six were granted a further appeal (their third) in 1991, when more evidence established that the police evidence at their trial had been fabricated. The Director of Public Prosecutions announced before the appeal was held that he no longer considered their convictions safe and satisfactory. Lane did not preside over the appeal which formally cleared them. Their successful appeal led to calls for Lane to resign, including a hostile editorial in The Times and a motion in the House of Commons signed by 140 members of parliament. These, and other cases where convictions were overturned, blighted the end of Lane's tenure as Lord Chief Justice. Retirement Despite previous thoughts that he would resign before the end of his time to enjoy an active retirement, Lane stayed in office until 1992. Despite remaining in office after the Birmingham Six were released, he nevertheless resigned over a year before he would have been forced to retire at the age of 75. He headed a commission in 1993 which recommended the end of the mandatory life sentence for murder, but otherwise kept a low profile (he never gave press interviews while in office and did not change that policy in his retirement). He died in 2005 and was buried in the churchyard at St Ippolyts, near Hitchin in Hertfordshire.

The preceptory's chapel, constructed by the Knights Templar, is currently part of the Rothley Court Hotel. History =Foundation= Rothley Preceptory was established around the year 1231; however, records show \\"The Poor Fellow- Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon\\" (more commonly known as the Knights Templar) owned land at Rothley as early as the reign of King John (1199‚Äì1216). On the establishment of the preceptory King Henry III granted the Knights Templar the manor and church at Rothley. The preceptory would come to own land in 13 neighbouring villages, including granges used for farming at Baggrave (near Hungarton) and Gaddesby. The knights of the preceptory also owned the Manor at Gaddesby. Around 1250, the preceptory was recorded as having a yearly revenue of ¬£62. 10s. 5d., which was used to help fellow Knights Templar in Acre, in modern-day Israel. In 1284, King Edward I granted the preceptory's knights a charter, permitting them to hold a weekly market, on a Monday, at Rothley, and an annual fair in honour of Saint Barnabas each June. This lasted until 1306, when King Edward issued the knights with another charter permitting them to hold a market and festival at their manor at Gaddesby, instead of at Rothley. This charter afforded a weekly market on a Wednesday and an annual festival in July in honour of Mary Magdalen. =End of the Knights Templar= Pope Clement V who, under the instructions of King Philip IV of France, issued the Pastoralis Praeeminentiae suppressing the Knights Templar After losing the Holy Land in 1291, the Knights Templar lost purpose, power and influence, and were forced to move their headquarters to France. Shortly after, King Philip IV of France, heavily indebted to the order, started a campaign against the Knights Templar, using his puppet Pope Clement V.Malcolm Barber, The Trial of the Templars. Cambridge University Press, 1978. King Philip had Pope Clement arrest the Templars for various offences, including: apostasy, idolatry, heresy, obscene rituals, homosexuality, financial corruption, fraud, and secrecy. Under torture, many confessed. With these confessions, and after more bullying from the French King, on 22 November 1307 Pope Clement issued a Papal bull, known as the Pastoralis Praeeminentiae, which instructed the monarchs of Europe to arrest all of the Knights Templar, and to seize their properties on behalf of the church. King Philip had thereby freed himself of his debts. Initially, King Edward II of England refused to believe the allegations against the Templars. However, in 1308, Rothley Preceptory, together with the Templars' other possessions in England, were seized by the Crown. An inventory of the dissolved preceptory from 1309 reveals that the preceptory consisted of both a hall and a chapel (thought to have been built around 1240), and had over 350 sheep. =Knights Hospitaller= In 1313 the preceptory and its lands were transferred to the Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, more commonly known as the Knights Hospitaller. Rothley does not appear to have been administered by the Knights Hospitallers as an independent preceptory, and was merged with the joint Dalby and Heather Preceptory by 1371, another Hospitaller establishment within Leicestershire. One Preceptor then controlled all three of these preceptories from Dalby. From around 1500 the land at all three preceptories ‚Äì Dalby, Heather and Rothley ‚Äì appears to have been rented out. In 1535, the three combined preceptories are recorded as providing the order with a sizable annual income of ¬£231. 7s. 10d.'House of Knights Hospitallers: Preceptory of Dalby and Heather', A History of the County of Leicestershire: Volume 2 (1954), pp. 32‚Äì33. Date accessed: 16 June 2013. In the 15th century the Hospitallers made alterations to the earlier chapel at the preceptory. =Dissolution= The preceptory was suppressed and dissolved in 1540. The Lordship of the Manor of Rothley, previously held by the preceptory, was from 1565 until 1845 in the hands of the Babington family. The Babingtons chose not to demolish the preceptory's chapel, and it was incorporated, along with some fragments of the preceptory's domestic buildings, into the house they built on the site. Later history =Abolition of the slave trade= Rothley Temple eventually passed to Thomas Babington (1758‚Äì1837) who was a prominent figure in the Clapham Sect and the fight to abolish the slave trade. A close friend of William Wilberforce, Babington and Wilberforce met frequently at Rothley Temple whilst drafting their anti-slavery bill. Babington later served as MP for Leicester and High Sheriff of Leicestershire and was buried in the chapel at Rothley Temple. A large stone monument and plaque stand outside the building today, commemorating the building's, and Babington's, part in the abolition of slavery. In 1800, Rothley Temple was the birthplace of Thomas Babington Macaulay (1800‚Äì1859 later Lord Macaulay the historian) named after his uncle. =Rothley Court= The preceptory's chapel and part of the domestic buildings still exist, and are now part of the Rothley Court Hotel. Rothley Court, originally a stately home, incorporates part of the preceptory that was converted for residential use in the 16th century. Much of what can be seen today is from substantial renovation and extension works conducted by John Ely of Manchester, between 1894 and 1895. Rothley Court Hotel, which incorporates part of the former preceptory. In the foreground stands the monument recognising Rothley Temple's role in the Abolition of the Slave Trade The chapel was heavily restored in 1896. In 1951, Rothley Court and the chapel were protected as Grade I Listed Buildings. A number of stone artefacts and partial grave slabs have been discovered over the years around the chapel, where they can be seen today.Rothley ‚Äì Rothley Temple and the Chapel of the Knights Templar ‚Äì Leicestershire Villages This includes a recently restored effigy of a Templar knight, originally discovered in Rothley Churchyard in 1790; following a ¬£2,000 restoration completed in 2011, the effigy has been placed within the original Chapel at Rothley Temple. Rothley Temple is also the name of a branch (\\"lodge\\") of the Freemasons. The lodge, founded in 1961/62, took its name from the preceptory because of its association with the Knights Templar. Preceptors The Preceptor was head of the preceptory. Similar to an Abbot with an Abbey and a Prior with a Priory, the Preceptor was in charge of the preceptory's church and land, and managed the brethren of the order who lived at the preceptory. The Preceptor was answerable to the Grand Master of his order.

He was the conceptor of standardised designs for ships of the line and frigates fielded by the French Navy in the 1780s, which served during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars and in some cases remained in service into the 1860s. Captured ships of his design were commissioned in the Royal Navy and even copied. His achievements earned San√© the nickname of \\"naval Vauban\\"French: \\"Vauban de la Marine\\", after S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban known for his breakthrough fortifications.  Biography  Born in Brest in a family of sailors, San√© became a student engineer in 1758 and joined the naval construction academy in Paris in 1765, graduating On 1 October 1766 as an assistant engineer.Jaquin, p.45 In 1767, he worked under Ollivier the Elder on naval ships, and with Antoine Choquet de Lindu on merchant ships. In 1769, he embarked on the fluyt Seine, bound for Martinique with four scows and a dredger of his design.Jaquin, p.46 Promoted to engineer in 1774, he designed the Annibal class 74-gun, comprising Annibal and Northumberland. He then worked on several 12-pounder frigates.Gibouin, p. 217Jaquin, p.48 During the War of American Independence, Navy minister Sartine, his successor Castries, and engineer Borda requested standard plans to standardise the production of 18-pounder frigates (equivalent to the British Fifth-rate), 74-gun ships of the line (equivalent to the British Third-rate), 80-gun two-deckers (without equivalent: similar to a Third-rate, but longer than a Second-rate and with comparable firepower), and 118-gun three-deckers (equivalent to the British First-rate). San√© won three successive competitions: * in 1782, his T√©m√©raire class was selected for the 74-gunsDebusscher, p. 36 * in 1785, his Oc√©an class was selected for the 118-guns * his Tonnant class was later selected for the 80-gunsJaquin, p.51 In 1784, San√© had his only child, Am√©lie Fanny Gabrielle; she would later marry Captain Delarue de la Gr√©ardi√®re, and die in December d√©cembre 1812. On 18 June 1787, San√© joined the Acad√©mie de Marine.Henwood, pp. 125-134 In April 1779, he arrived in Saint-Malo for the construction of H√©b√©-class V√©nus, a 12-pounder 38-gun frigate. He furthermore drew the plans of the frigates Aigle, Cl√©op√¢tre, Thisb√© and Dryade. In 1789, he was promoted to sub-director of naval constructions. In 1793, as director of Brest Harbour, he decided to raze the older ships Brutus, Pluton and Argonaute.Debusscher, p. 38 He was made a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1796, and naval construction inspector on 7 July 1798, responsible for the coast of the Atlantic and of the English Channel; his duty comprised inspection of the harbours and selection of timbers from the forests in the Pyrenees.Jaquin, p.53-54 In 1800, San√© was made General inspector for naval engineering, an office he would retain until 1817. In 1807, San√© designed a type of corvette that remained in service until the end of the sailing navy. The same year, Napol√©on required a collection of accurate ship models to document the French Navy; Denis Decr√®s tasked San√© with the project, known as the Trianon model collection, for which 13 models were specially created and 6 others collected and upgraded.H√©l√®ne Tromparent-de Seynes, Jacques-No√´l San√©, brillant ing√©nieur de la Marine, p. 46.Exposition virtuelle : La \\"Collection Trianon\\" His plans for 18-pounder frigates were adopted in 1810; the same year, he was made a Baron of Empire. Under the Restauration, San√© was awarded the Order of Saint Michael. In 1820, aged 80, he was made president of the Commission de Paris, although he never involved himself in the upcoming steamship revolution. The first steamer of the French Navy, Sphinx, entered service in 1829. San√© died in Paris on 22 August 1831, aged 91.

He succeeded in the first part (which is obvious by definition), but for the other part, he managed only to prove a many-one reduction. It was affirmed by Friedberg and Muchnik in the 1950s using a novel technique called the priority method. They give a construction for a set that is simple (and thus non-recursive), but fails to compute the halting problem.Nies (2009) p.35  Formal definitions and some properties  *A set I \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{N} is called immune if I is infinite, but for every index e, we have W_e \\\\text{ infinite} \\\\implies W_e ot\\\\subseteq I. Or equivalently: there is no infinite subset of I that is recursively enumerable. *A set S \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{N} is called simple if it is recursively enumerable and its complement is immune. *A set I \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{N} is called effectively immune if I is infinite, but there exists a recursive function f such that for every index e, we have that W_e \\\\subseteq I \\\\implies \\\\\\\\#(W_e) < f(e). *A set S \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{N} is called effectively simple if it is recursively enumerable and its complement is effectively immune.

The Khatushyam Temple is a Hindu temple in the village of Khatushyamji, Rajasthan, (Sikar district) India, that is very popular with pilgrims. Devotees believe it houses the miraculously rediscovered head of Barbarika or Khatushyam, a character from the Mahabharata. Legend Before the beginning of the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata battle, Barbarika's last wish was to see the war \\"Mahabharat\\" so Lord krishna himself placed his head on the top of a mountain for Barbarika to see the war. After many years when Kalyug started the head was found buried in the village of Khatu (District- Sikar) in present-day Rajasthan. The location was obscured until well after the Kaliyuga period began. Then, on one occasion, milk started flowing spontaneously out of a cow's udder when she neared the burial spot. Amazed at this incident, the local villagers dug the place up and the buried head was revealed. The head was handed over to a Brahmin who worshipped it for many days, awaiting divine revelations as to what was to be done next. Roopsingh Chauhan, king of Khatu, then had a dream where he was inspired to build a temple and install the head therein. Subsequently, a temple was built and the idol was installed on the 11th day of the Shukla Paksha (bright half) of the month of Phalgun. There is another, only slightly different version of this legend. Roopsingh Chauhan was the ruler of Khatu. His wife, Narmada Kanwar, once had a dream in which the deity instructed her to take his image out of the earth. The indicated place (now known as Shyam Kund) when then dug up. Sure enough, it yielded the idol, which was duly enshrined in the temple. The original temple was built in 1027 AD by Roopsingh Chauhan, after his wife Narmada Kanwar, saw dream about the buried idol. The place where the idol was dug out from is called Shyam Kund. In 1720 AD, a nobleman known as Diwan Abhaisingh renovated the old temple, at the behest of the then ruler of Marwar. The temple took its present shape at this time and the idol was enshrined in the sanctum sanctorum. The idol is made of rare stone. Khatushyam is the family deity of many families. His another temple is located at Lambha, Ahmedabad, Gujarat where people are coming with their newly born child to have blessings of Khatushyam. Here he is known as Baliya Dev. Architectural features The temple is architecturally rich. Lime mortar, marble and tiles have been used in constructing the structure. The shutters of the sanctum sanctorum are beautifully covered with gold sheet. Outside is the prayer hall, named Jagmohan. The hall is large in size (measuring 12.3 m x 4.7 m) and its walls are elaborately painted, depicting mythological scenes. The entrance gate and exit gate are made of marble; their brackets are also of marble and feature ornamental floral designs. =Precincts= There is an open space in front of the entrance gate of the temple. The Shyam Bagicha is a garden near the temple from where flowers are picked to be offered to the deity. The Samadhi of Aloo Singh, a great devotee, is located within the garden. The \\"Shyam Kund\\" is a holy pond near the temple from where the 'Sheesh' of baba shyam came out. In this kund devotees take bath and do worship of khatu naresh. The Gopinath temple lies to the south-east of the main temple. The Gaurishankar temple also lies nearby. There is an interesting tale associated with the Gaurishankar temple. It is said that some soldiers of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb wanted to destroy this temple. They attacked the Shiva lingam enshrined within this temple with their spears. Immediately, fountains of blood appeared from the Shiva Lingam. The soldiers ran away, terrified. One can still see the mark of the spear on the Lingam. Khatushyam main temple is located at Khatu Town about 80 km from Jaipur. Devotees are requested to take route via Ringus. Administration and amenities The Public Trust that has charge of the temple is registered under registration No. 3/86. A 7-member committee oversees the management of the temple. A number of Dharmashalas (charity lodges) are available for their comfortable stay. The temple timings are as follows: *In winter (Ashvin bahula 1st to Chaitra shuddha 15th): 5.30 am - 1.00 pm and 4.00 pm - 9.00 pm. *In summer (Vaishakha bahula 1st to Bhadrapada shuddha 15th): 4.30 am - 12.30 pm and 4.00 pm - 10.00 pm. The temple is open 24 hours a day on every Shukla Paksha Ekadasi, i.e., on the 11th day of the bright half of every month in the Hindu calendar. The temple is also open throughout the 4-day Phalgun Mela.

The name of the city of Thiruvananthapuram in Malayalam translates to \\"The City of Lord Ananta\\", referring to the deity of the Padmanabhaswamy temple. The temple is built in an intricate fusion of the Chera style and the Dravidian style of architecture, featuring high walls, and a 16th-century gopura. While the Ananthapura temple in Kumbla is considered the original seat of the deity (\\"Moolasthanam\\"), architecturally to some extent, the temple is a replica of the Adikesava Perumal temple in Thiruvattar. The principal deity Padmanabhaswamy (Vishnu) is enshrined in the \\"Anantha Shayana\\" posture, the eternal yogic sleep on the serpent Adi Shesha. Padmanabhaswamy is the tutelary deity of the royal family of Travancore. The titular Maharaja of Travancore, Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma, is the trustee of the temple. History Gopuram of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple Several extant Hindu Texts like the Brahma Purana, Matsya Purana, Varaha Purana, Skanda Purana, Padma Purana, Vayu Purana, Bhagavata Purana and the Mahabharata mention this shrine. The Temple has been referred to in the (only recorded) Sangam period of literature between 500 BCE and 300 CE several times. Many conventional historians and scholars are of the opinion that one of the names that the Temple had, \\"The Golden Temple\\", literally was in cognizance of the fact that the Temple was already unimaginably wealthy by that point. Many extant pieces of Sangam Tamil literature and poetry, and later works of the 9th century of Tamil poet-saints like Nammalwar, refer to the temple and the city as having walls of pure gold. At some places, both the temple and the entire city are often eulogised as being made of gold, and the temple as heaven. The temple is one of the 108 principal Divya Desams (\\"Holy Abodes\\") in Vaishnavism, and is glorified in the Divya Prabandha. The Divya Prabandha glorifies this shrine as being among the 13 Divya Desam in Malai Nadu (corresponding to present-day Kerala with Kanyakumari District). The 8th century Tamil poet Alvar Nammalvar sang the glories of Padmanabha. The Ananthapuram temple in Kasaragod is believed to be the original seat of Padmanabhaswamy (\\"Moolasthanam\\"). It is believed that Parasurama purified and venerated the idol of Sree Padmanabha Swamy in Dwapara Yuga. Parasurama entrusted 'Kshethra karyam' (Administration of the Temple) with seven Potti families ‚Äì Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti, Neythasseri Potti and Sreekaryathu Potti. King Adithya Vikrama of Vanchi (Venad) was directed by Parasurama to do 'Paripalanam' (Protection) of the Temple. Parasurama gave the Tantram of the Temple to Tharananallur Namboothiripad. This legend is narrated in detail in 'Kerala Mahathmyam' which forms part of 'Brahmanda Puranam'. Another version regarding the consecration of the Main Idol of the Temple relates to the legendary sage Vilvamangalathu Swamiyar. Swamiyar, who resided near Ananthapuram Temple in Kasaragod District, prayed to Lord Vishnu for his darshan or \\"auspicious sight\\". The Lord is believed to have come in the guise of a little boy who was mischievous. The boy defiled the Idol which was kept for Puja. The sage became enraged at this and chased away the boy who disappeared before him. Realizing the boy was no ordinary mortal, the sage wept for forgiveness and asked for another darshan as a sign. He heard a voice say \\"If you want to see me come to the Anathavana (the unending forest or ananthakadu). After a long search, when he was walking on the banks of Laccadive Sea, he heard a pulaya lady warning her child that she would throw him in Ananthankadu. The moment the Swami heard the word Ananthankadu he was delighted. He proceeded to Ananthankadu based on the directions of the lady of whom he enquired. The Sage reached Ananthankadu searching for the boy. There he saw the boy merging into an Iluppa tree (Indian Butter Tree). The tree fell down and became Anantha Sayana Moorti (Vishnu reclining on the celestial snake Anantha). But the edifice that the Lord assumed was of an extraordinarily large size, with His head at Thiruvattar near Thuckalay Tamil Nadu, Body or Udal at Thiruvananthapuram, and lotus-feet at Thrippadapuram near Kulathoor and Technopark (Thrippappur), making him some eight miles in length. The Sage requested the Lord to shrink to a smaller proportion that would be thrice the length of his staff. Immediately the Lord shrank to the form of the Idol that is seen at present in the Temple. But even then many Iluppa trees obstructed a complete vision of the Lord. The Sage saw the Lord in three parts ‚Äì thirumukham, thiruvudal and thrippadam. Swami prayed to Padmanabha to be forgiven. The Swami offered Rice Kanji and Uppumanga (salted mango pieces) in a coconut shell to the Perumal which he obtained from the pulaya woman. The spot where the Sage had darsan of the Lord belonged to Koopakkara Potti and Karuva Potti. With the assistance of the reigning King and some Brahmin households a Temple was constructed. The Ananthankadu Nagaraja Temple still exists to the north west of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The Samadhi (final resting place) of the Swamiyar exists to the west of the Padmanabha Temple. A Krishna Temple was built over the Samadhi. This Temple, known as Vilvamangalam Sri Krishna Swami Temple, belongs to Thrissur Naduvil Madhom. Mukilan, a Muslim marauder, invaded vast chunks of Venad in 1680 AD.Menon, P Shungoonny. 'A History of Travancore from the Earliest Times'.Madras: Higginbotham, 1878 He destroyed Budhapuram Bhaktadasa Perumal Temple owned by Neythasseri Potti. Mukilan had plans to plunder the vaults of Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple and destroy it. But he was dissuaded from doing so by local Pathans loyal to the Royals of Venad. Padmanabhan Thampi, arch rival of Anizhom Thirunal Marthanda Varma, marched to Thiruvananthapuram with his forces and tried to loot the vaults of the Temple. Thampi stayed at Sri Varaham and sent his mercenaries to Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple. It is said that divine serpents materialised in hundreds and scared away Thampi's men. Emboldened by this heavenly intervention, Pallichal Pillai and local people opposed Padmanabhan Thampi and ensured that the mercenaries did not proceed with the misadventure. =Travancore royal family= In the first half of the 18th century, in line with matrilineal customs, Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma, succeeded his uncle Rama Varma as king at the age of 23. He successfully suppressed the 700-year-old stranglehold of the Ettuveetil Pillamar (\\"Lords of the Eight Houses\\") and his cousins following the discovery of conspiracies which the lords were involved in against the royal house of Travancore (There are various legends and disputes about these mostly apocryphal stories but overall he took control and centralised the rule). The last major renovation of the Padmanabhaswamy temple commenced immediately after Anizham Thirunal's accession to the musnud and the idol was reconsecrated in 906 ME (1731 CE). On 17 January 1750, Anizham Thirunal surrendered the kingdom of Travancore to Padmanabha Swamy, the deity at the temple, and pledged that he and his descendants would be vassals or agents of the deity who would serve the kingdom as Padmanabha Dasa. Since then, the name of every Travancore king was preceded by the title Sree Padmanabha Dasa; the female members of the royal family were called Sree Padmanabha Sevinis. The donation of the king to Padmanabhaswamy was known as Thrippadi-danam. The final wishes of Anizham Thirunal on his passing at the age of 53 clearly delineated the historical relationship between the Maharaja and the temple: \\"That no deviation whatsoever should be made in regard to the dedication of the kingdom to Padmanabhaswamy and that all future territorial acquisitions should be made over to the Devaswom.\\" Temple structure The approach road to the Padmanabhaswamy temple =Main shrine= In the Garbhagriha, Padmanabha reclines on the serpent Anantha or Adi Sesha. The serpent has five hoods facing inwards, signifying contemplation. The Lord's right hand is placed over a Shiva lingam. Sridevi-Lakshmi, the Goddess of Prosperity and Bhudevi the Goddess of Earth, two consorts of Vishnu are by his side. Brahma emerges on a lotus, which emanates from the navel of the Lord. The deity is made from 12,008 saligramams. These saligrams are from the banks of the Gandaki River in Nepal, and to commemorate this certain rituals used to be performed at the Pashupatinath Temple.Mathrubhumi, 12 August 2011 The deity of Padmanabha is covered with, \\"Katusarkara yogam\\", a special ayurvedic mix, which forms a plaster that keeps the deity clean. The daily worship is with flowers and for the abhishekam, special deities are used. The platforms in front of the vimanam and where the deity rests are both carved out of a single massive stone and hence called \\"Ottakkal-mandapam\\". On the orders of Marthanda Varma (1706‚Äì58), the Ottakkal-mandapam was cut out of a rock at Thirumala, about north of the temple. It measured in area by thick and was placed in front of the deity in the month of Edavom 906 M.E. (1731 CE). At the same time, Marthanda Varma also brought 12,000 shaligrams, aniconic representations of Vishnu, from the Gandaki River, north of Benares (now known as Varanasi) to the temple. These were used in the reconsecration of the Padmanabha. In order to perform darshan and puja, one has to ascend to the mandapam. The Deity is visible through three doors ‚Äì the visage of the reclining Lord and Siva Linga underneath the hand is seen through the first door; Sridevi and Bhrigu Muni in Katusarkara, Brahma seated on a lotus emanating from the Lord's navel, hence the name, \\"Padmanabha\\", gold abhisheka moorthies of Lord Padmanabha, Sridevi and Bhudevi, and silver utsava moorthi of Padmanabha through the second door; the Lord's feet, and Bhudevi and Markandeya Muni in Katusarkara through the third door. The idols of two goddesses holding chamaram, Garuda, Narada, Tumburu, the divine forms of the six weapons of Lord Vishnu, Surya, Chandra, Saptarshi (Seven Sages), Madhu, and Kaitabha are also there in the Sanctum. Only the King of Travancore may perform sashtanga namaskaram, or prostrate on the \\"Ottakkal Mandapam\\". It is traditionally held that anybody who prostrates on the mandapam has surrendered all that he possesses to the Deity. Since the ruler has already done that, he is permitted to prostrate on this mandapam. =Other shrines= Inside the Temple, there are two other important shrines, Thekkedom and Thiruvambadi, for the Deities, Ugra Narasimha and Krishna Swami respectively. Centuries back, several families of Vrishni Kshatriyas travelled to the south carrying with them idols of Lord Balarama and Lord Krishna. When they reached the hallowed land of Sree Padmanabha they gave the idol of Balarama, also known as Bhaktadasa, to Neythasseri Potti. Neythasseri Potti built a Temple at Budhapuram in the present day Kanyakumari District and had this idol installed there. The Vrishnis gifted the idol of Krishna to Maharaja Udaya Marthanda Varma of Venad. The Maharaja constructed a separate shrine, known as Thiruvambadi, in the premises of Padmanabhaswamy Temple for this idol. The Thiruvambadi shrine enjoys an independent status. Thiruvambadi has its own namaskara mandapam, bali stones and flagmast. The Lord of Thiruvambadi is Parthasarathi, the Divine Charioteer of Arjuna. The two-armed granite idol, with one hand holding the whip and the other resting on the left thigh holding the conch close to it, is in standing posture. On Ekadasi days, the Lord is dressed and decorated as Mohini. The Vrishnies who came to Venad and settled there are known as Krishnan vakakkar as they belong to the lineage of Lord Krishna. There are also shrines for Rama accompanied by Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman, Vishwaksena (the Nirmalyadhari of Vishnu and Remover of Obstacles), Vyasa, Ganapati, Sasta, and Kshetrapala (who guards the temple). Grand idols of Garuda and Hanuman stand with folded hands in the Valiya balikkal area. The thevara idols of Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma and Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma are housed in the south east part of the Temple. =Gopuram= The foundation of the present gopuram was laid in 1566. The temple has a , 7-tier gopuram made in the Pandyan style.T. Madhava Menon, (2000) A handbook of Kerala, Volume 1. pp.243 The temple stands by the side of a tank, named Padma Theertham (meaning the lotus spring). The temple has a corridor with 365 and one-quarter sculptured granite-stone pillars with elaborate carvings which stands out to be an ultimate testimonial for the Vishwakarma sthapathis in sculpting this architectural masterpiece. This corridor extends from the eastern side into the sanctum sanctorum. An flagstaff stands in front of the main entry from the prakaram(closed precincts of a temple). The ground floor under the gopuram (main entrance in the eastern side) is known as the 'Nataka Sala' where the famous temple art Kathakali was staged in the night during the ten-day uthsavam (festival) conducted twice a year, during the Malayalam months of Meenam and Thulam. Temple rituals =Festivals and rites= Narasimha Swamy and Padmanabha Swamy after coming from Shankumuka Beach during Aarat Festival There are many festivals related to this temple. The major festivals are bi-annual. The Alpashy festival which is in October/November and the Panguni festival which is in Tamil month Panguni, March/April, lasts for 10 days each. On the ninth day the Maharajah of Travancore, in his capacity as Thrippappoor Mooppan, escorts the deities to the vettakkalam for Pallivetta. Centuries back, the Pallivetta procession was said to pass through Kaithamukku, Kuthiravattom (Kunnumpuram), Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram and Putharikkandam. The festivals culminate with the Aarat (holy bath) procession to the Shankumugham Beach. The word Aarat refers to the purificatory immersion of the deities of the temple in sea. This event takes place in the evening. The Maharajah of Travancore escorts the Aarat procession on foot. The festival idols \\"Utsava Vigrahas\\" of Padmanabhaswamy, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami are given a ritual bath in the sea, after the prescribed pujas. After this ceremony, the idols are taken back to the temple in a procession that is lit by traditional torches, marking the conclusion of the festival. A major annual festival related to Padmanabha temple is the Navaratri festival. The idols of Saraswati Amman, Mun Uditha Nangai (Parasakti who appeared before Saraswati, Lakshmi and Parvati to help them identify their husbands who had been transformed into infants by the power of chastity of Anasuya) and Kumara Swami (Murugan) are brought to the Kuthira malika palace in front of Padmanabha temple as a procession. This festival lasts for 9 days. The famous Swathi music festival is held every year during this festival. Big idol of Pandavas displayed during Panguni festival The biggest festival in this temple is laksha deepam, which means hundred thousand (or one lakh) lamps. This festival is unique and commences once in 6 years. Prior to this festival, chanting of prayers and recitation of three vedas is done for 56 days (Murajapam). On the last day, hundred thousand oil lamps are lit in and around the temple premises. The next laksha deepam is slated in January 2020. =Priests= Temples where 'Swamiyar Pushpanjali' is conducted are claimants to extra sanctity. Sannyasins from Naduvil Madhom and Munchira Madhom do pushpanjali (flower worship) daily to Padmanabha, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. Tharananallur Nambuthiripads of Iranjalakkuda are the Tantris of the Temple. The Nambies, altogether four in number, are the Chief Priests of the Temple. Two Nambies ‚Äì Periya Nambi and Panchagavyathu Nambi ‚Äì are allotted to Padmanabha and one Nambi each to Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. The Nambies hail from either side of the Chandragiri River. = Temple entry = In line with the Temple Entry Proclamation, only those who profess the Hindu faith are permitted entry to the temple and devotees have to strictly follow the dress code.Pippa De Bruyn, Keith Bain, David Allardice Frommer's India 2010 Page 281 \\"Padmanabhaswamy Temple ‚Äì This Tamil style Vishnu temple, said to be the largest in Kerala, may be off-limits to non- Hindus, but the \\"temple guides\\" manage to target foreigners with great ease, leading them to the obligatory spots from. \\" Temple management The Padmanabhaswamy Temple and its property were controlled by the Ettara Yogam (King and Council of Eight) with the assistance of Ettuveetil Pillamar (\\"Lords of the Eight Houses\\"). The Ettara Yogam consists of Pushpanjali Swamiyar, six member Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha, Sabhanjithan (Secretary) and Arachan (Maharaja of Travancore). Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha was primarily responsible for the administration of the Temple. Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti and Neythasseri Potti are the members of the Sabha. The Pushpanjali Swamiyar presides over the meetings of the Sabha. Sreekaryathu Potti is the Sabhanjithan of the Sabha.Sri Padmanabha Swamy Kshethram Charithra Rekhakalilude by S. Uma Maheswari Any decision taken by the Sabha can be implemented only if the Maharaja of Travancore approves of it.Charithram Kuricha Sree Padmanabha Swamy Kshethram by Dr MG Sasibhooshan and Dr RP Raja It is believed that eight members of Ettara Yogam (seven Potties and the Maharaja of Travancore) received their rights from Lord Parashurama Himself. In the past, only the Swamiyars of the Naduvil Madhom were appointed as Pushpanjali Swamiyars by the Maharaja of Travancore. Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma curtailed the authority of Ettara Yogam and liquidated the powerful Ettuveetil Pillamar. Ettara Yogam became an advisory and assenting body thereafter. Besides Naduvil Madhom, Munchira Madhom got the right to appoint Pushpanjali Swamiyars during his reign. In the recent past, Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma gave Pushpanjali rights to the Swamiyars of Thrikkaikattu Madhom and Thekke Madhom as well. Though the Maharaja is the appointing authority of the Pushpanjali Swamiyar, the former must do a Vechu Namaskaram when he sees the Swamiyar. With the passing away of Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma in December 2013, his nephew Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma became the titular Maharaja of Travancore in January 2014. Like his predecessors, Moolam Thirunal also got concurrence from the Ettara Yogam before assuming the title 'Maharaja'. In the presence of the Maharaja designate, the Yogathil Pottimar and the Tantri, the Pushpanjali Swamiyar Maravanchery Thekkedathu Neelakanta Bharatikal signed on the Neettu (Order) of the Ettara Yogam accepting Moolam Thirunal as Chirava Mootha Thiruvadi (Maharaja of Travancore) and Thrippappoor Mootha Thiruvadi (Protector of the Temple). This ceremony took place at Kulasekhara Mandapam in Padmanabha Swamy Temple. Revathi Thirunal Balagopal Varma, grandson of Maharani Regent Pooradom Thirunal Sethu Lakshmi Bayi, is the titular Elayaraja of Travancore. Extant temple records A pertinent event in the long history of the temple was the construction of a \\"granta-pura\\" (record-room) within the temple compound itself around 1425 A.D. by the then Venad King Veera Iravi Iravi Varma, to store the \\"Mathilakam\\" (within-the-walls) records, as the then existing temple records were known. A major portion of those records (over 3000 'Cadjan' leaf- records) from the Mathikalam had been donated later to the Archives Department in 1867 at the time of the formation of the latter. Each of these Cadjan leaf- records, which have been compiled over thousands of years, contains 10,000 documentations according to R._Nagaswamy, noted archaeologist and historian, totalling over 30 crores of records. Despite their cultural value, only a minuscule portion of these grantas (bundles) of cadjan leaf records, written mostly in ancient scripts of proto-Tamil and archaic-Malayalam, have been deciphered. The translations of this section of manuscripts by some scholars serve as a rare but very inadequate primary source material on the temple and its rich traditions. The rest of these Mathilakam documents ‚Äì segregated under 70 \\"heads\\" ‚Äì is still lying idle with the Archives Department. According to Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi Bayi, a member of the Travancore Royal Family and author of a book on the temple, from a very early period in recorded history the temple had employed two kinds of 'record writers'. One group was to record the proceedings and transactions of the Ettarayogam, a council of temple administrators, that included the then king. The other was to write and preserve the records of the day-to-day functioning of the temple, maintain correct accounts of the temple-treasury, and of temple-revenue-collections and temple-expenditure and as well as to note down all the other records, connected with the functioning of the temple. Temple assets The temple and its assets belong to Lord Padmanabhaswamy, and were for a long time controlled by a trust, headed by the Travancore royal family. However, at the present, the Supreme Court of India has divested the Travancore royal family from leading the management of the temple.Kerala government has no right over the wealth, 6 July 2011, Rediff.comSC halts opening of Kerala temple's last vault, TNN & Agencies 8 July 2011Apex court restrains opening of Kerala temple vault Express news service, Sat 9 July 2011 T P Sundararajan's litigations changed the way the world looked at the Temple. In June 2011, the Supreme Court directed the authorities from the archaeology department and the fire services, to open the secret chambers of the temple for inspection of the items kept inside. The temple has six hitherto known vaults (nilavaras), labelled as A to F, for book keeping purpose by the Court (Since, however, an Amicus Curie Report by Justice Gopal Subramaniam, in April 2014, has reportedly found two more further subterranean vaults that have been named G and H). While vault B has been unopened over centuries, A was possibly opened in the 1930s, and vaults C to F have been opened from time to time over recent years. The two priests of the temple, the 'Periya Nambi' and the 'Thekkedathu Nambi', are the custodians of the four vaults, C to F, which are opened periodically. The Supreme Court had directed that \\"the existing practices, procedures, and rituals\\" of the temple be followed while opening vaults C to F and using the articles inside, while Vaults A and B would be opened only for the purpose of making an inventory of the articles and then closed. The review of the temple's underground vaults was undertaken by a seven-member panel appointed by the Supreme Court of India to generate an inventory, leading to the enumeration of a vast collection of articles that are traditionally kept under lock and key. A detailed inventory of the temple assets, consisting of gold, jewels, and other valuables is yet to be made. While vault B remains unopened, vaults A, C, D, E and F were opened along with some of their antechambers. Among the reported findings, are a three-and-a-half feet tall solid pure golden idol of Mahavishnu, studded with hundreds of diamonds and rubies and other precious stones. Also found were an 18-foot-long pure gold chain, a gold sheaf weighing , a golden veil, 1200 'Sarappalli' gold coin- chains that are encrusted with precious stones, and several sacks filled with golden artefacts, necklaces, diadems, diamonds, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, gemstones, and objects made of other precious metals. Ceremonial attire for adorning the deity in the form of 16-part gold anki weighing almost , gold coconut shells studded with rubies and emeralds, and several 18th century Napoleonic era coins were found amongst many other objects. In early 2012, an expert committee had been appointed to investigate these objects, which include lakhs of golden coins of the Roman Empire, that were found in Kottayam, in Kannur District. According to Vinod Rai, the former Comptroller- and-Auditor-General(CAG) of India, who had audited some of the Temple records from 1990, in August 2014, in the already opened vault A, there is an hoard of gold coins dating to around 200 BCE, each coin priced at over . Also found was a pure Golden Throne, studded with hundreds of diamonds and other fully precious stones, meant for the 18-foot-long Deity. As per one of the men, who was among those that went inside this Vault A, several of the largest diamonds were as large as a full-grown man's thumb. According to varying reports, at least three, if not more, of solid gold crowns have been found, studded with diamonds and other precious stones. Some other media reports also mention hundreds of pure gold chairs, thousands of gold pots and jars, among the articles recovered from Vault A and its antechambers. This revelation has solidified the status of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple as the wealthiest place of worship in the world. It is conservatively estimated that the value of the monumental items is close to 1.2 lakh crore or . If the antique and cultural value were taken into account these assets could be worth ten times the current market price. As a reference, the entire GDP (revenues in all forms) of the Mughal Empire at its very zenith under Aurangzeb (in 1690), was a comparatively meagre US$90 billion in modern-day terms. In fact, at its richest, the Mughal \\"treasury\\" (in Akbar's and Jahangir's and Shah Jahan's periods) consisted of seven tonnes of gold, along with eighty pounds of uncut diamonds, a hundred pounds each of rubies and emeralds and six hundred pounds of pearls. Even with only the five smaller of the reported eight vaults being opened (the larger three vaults and all their ante-chambers still remaining closed), the treasure found so far, is considered to be by far the largest collection of items of gold and fully precious stones in the recorded history of the world. The valuables are believed to have been accumulated in the temple over several thousand years, having been donated to the Deity (and subsequently stored there), by various Dynasties like the Cheras, the Pandyas, the Travancore Royal Family, the Kolathiris, the Pallavas, the Cholas and many other Kings in the recorded history of both South India and beyond, and from the rulers and traders of Mesopotamia, Jerusalem, Greece, Rome, and later, the various colonial powers from Europe, and other countries as well. Some people have suggested that a part of the stored riches reached the Travancore kings in the later years in the form of tax as well as conquered wealth of other South Indian kingdoms. Most scholars however believe that this was accumulated over thousands of years, given the mention of the Deity and the Temple in several extant Hindu Texts, the Sangam Tamil literature (500 BC to 300 AD wherein it was referred to as the \\"Golden Temple\\" on account of its then unimaginable wealth), and the treasures consist of countless artefacts dating back to the Chera, Pandya and Greek and Roman epochs. The ancient late-Tamil- Sangam epic Silappatikaram (c 100 AD to 300 AD at the latest) speaks of the then Chera King Cenkuttuvan receiving gifts of gold and precious stones from a certain 'Golden Temple' (Arituyil-Amardon) which is believed to be the Pasmanabhaswamy Temple. Gold had been panned from rivers as well as mined in Thiruvananthapuram, Kannur, Wayanad, Kollam, Palakkad and Malappuram districts for thousands of years. The Malabar region (as a part of the \\"Tamilakam\\" region of recorded history) had several centers of trade and commerce since the Sumerian Period ranging from Vizhinjam in the South to Mangalore in the North. Also, at times like the invasion by Mysore in the late 1700s, the other related royal families (of the Travancore Royal Family) in Kerala and the Far South, like the Kolathiris, took refuge in Thiruvananthapuram and stored their temple-wealth for safekeeping in the Padmanabhaswamy Temple.http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/why-sree-padmanabhaswamy-temple-s- mysterious-vault-b-should-be-opened-expert-explains-65521 Also, much of the treasures housed in the much larger and as-yet-unopened vaults, as well as in the much smaller cellars that have been opened, date back to long before the institution of the so-called Travancore Kingdom, e.g. the hoard of gold coins from 200 B.C that was mentioned by Vinod Rai. Noted archaeologist and historian R. Nagaswamy has also stated that several records exist in Kerala, of offerings made to the Deity, from several parts of Kerala. Lastly, it has to be remembered that in the Travancore Kingdom, a distinction was always made between the Government (State) Treasury (Karuvelam), the Royal Family Treasury (Chellam), and the Temple Treasury (Thiruvara Bhandaram or Sri Bhandaram). During the reign of Maharani Gowri Lakshmi Bayi, hundreds of temples that were mismanaged in the Kerala region, were brought under the Government. The excess ornaments in these temples were also transferred to the Vaults of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. Instead the funds of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple were utilised for the daily upkeep of these temples. On 4 July 2011 the seven- member expert team tasked with taking stock of the temple assets decided to postpone opening of Chamber 'B'. This chamber is sealed with an iron door with the image of a cobra on it and it has not been opened, due to the belief opening it would result in much misfortune. The royal family said that many legends were attached to the temple and that chamber B has a model of a snake on the main door and opening it could be a bad omen. The seven-member team will consult with some more experts on 8 July 2011 and then they may take the final decision on opening of chamber 'B'. An Ashtamangala Devaprasnam conducted in the Temple to discern the will of the Lord revealed that any attempts to open Chamber 'B' would cause Divine displeasure and that the holy articles in the other chambers were defiled in the inventorying process. The original petitioner whose court action led to the inventory taking, T.P. Sundarajan, died in July 2011, adding credence to those who believe in the folklore around the temple.Oibituary: TP Sundararajan, who died on July 17 aged 70, obtained a court order which has led, this summer. to the opening of the vaults of the 16th century Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Trivandrum, in the southern Indian state of Kerala The Daily Telegraph, 20 July 2011 Prior to this now-famous incident in July 2011, one of the several vaults in the Temple which was not any of the Vaults B (untouched after the 1880s) or G or H (both rediscovered supposedly by the Amicus Curie only in mid-2014), was opened in 1931. This was possibly an antechamber of any of the Vaults A or C or D or E or F that may not have been opened yet. This was necessitated due to the severe economic depression that India was going through as was the entire world. The Palace and State Treasuries had run almost dry. The small group of people including the King and the priests found a granary-sized structure almost full with mostly gold and some silver coins and jewels. Surmounted on top of it were hundreds of pure gold pots. There were four coffers filled with gold coins as well. Also found was a larger chest fixed to the ground with six sections in it. They were full of gold jewellery encrusted with diamonds, rubies, sapphires and emeralds. Besides these, were four more chests of old coins (not of gold), and they were carried back to the Palace and State Treasuries for counting from. =Vault (Nilavara) B (\\"The Forbidden Zone\\")= The Bhagavata Purana says that Lord Balarama visited Phalgunam (more commonly known as Thiruvananthapuram), took bath in Panchapsaras (Padmateertham) and made a gift of ten thousand cows to holy men.\\"Srimad Bhagavata\\" (Page 381 of Volume Three). Translated by Swami Tapasyananda.

The southwest part of the Chuttambalam was constructed at the holy spot where Lord Balarama is believed to have donated cows to holy men. This portion came to be known as Mahabharatakonam and covered the ground underneath which both Kallara B and Kallara A were situated.Letter of His Holiness the Pushpanjali Swamiyar to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan According to a popular legend, many Devas and Sages devoted to Lord Balarama visited Him on the banks of Padmateertham. They requested Him that they may be permitted to reside there worshipping the Lord. Balarama granted them their wish. It is believed that these Devas and Sages reside in Kallara B worshipping the Lord. Naga Devathas devoted to the Lord also dwell in this Kallara.\\"Sri Padmanabho Rakshatu\\" by G Sekharan Nair, Mathrubhumi, Thiruvananthapuram Edition dated 17 September 2017 Kanjirottu Yakshi, whose enchanting and ferocious forms are painted on the south-west part of the main Sanctum, resides in this Kallara worshipping Lord Narasimha.Bayi, Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi. 'Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple' (Third Edition). Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 2013. Holy objects like Sreechakram were installed beneath this Kallara to enhance the potency of the Principal Deity. Lord Ugra Narasimha of Thekkedom is said to be the Protector of Kallara B. There is a serpent's image on Kallara B indicating danger to anyone who opens it. A four-day Ashtamangala Devaprasnam conducted in August 2011 declared Kallara B as \\"forbidden zone\\".The Hindu dated 7 July 2011 One of the oldest existing estimates regarding only Vault B, which can be considered to be at least as reliable as any other made since the discovery of the hidden treasure (or assets) of the Temple in 2011, was by the Travancore Royal Family itself in the 1880s (when an older existing inventory and estimate were last updated). According to it, the gold and precious stones contained in Vault B, which is by far the largest and the only vault (of the reported six) that is unopened so far, since the discovery of the treasure, was worth INR 12,000 Crores in the then (1880s') terms. Considering the subsequent inflation of the rupee and the increase in the prices of gold and precious stones since in general, the treasure in the unopened vault B alone would be worth at least in present-day terms, without the cultural value being factored in.https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimdobson/2015/11/13/a-one-trillion-dollar- hidden-treasure-chamber-is-discovered-at-indias-sree-padmanabhaswam- temple/#2594055d1ba6 The price of gold in the 1880s, when the inventory and estimate were last updated, was INR 1.8 per gram (The price of gold was about USD 18 for an ounce in the 1880s when the dollar was 3.3 to the rupee).https://nma.org/wp- content/uploads/2016/09/historic_gold_prices_1833_pres.pdf In fact, going by these figures, the gold in Vault B could potentially run into many more trillions of dollars even before the cultural or historical value is factored in. It is highly unlikely that Kallara B was opened after the 1880s. An article by Emily Gilchrist, a visiting Englishwoman in the 1933, recalls in her book 'Travancore: A Guide Book for the Visitor' (Oxford University Press, 1933) about an unsuccessful attempt to open one Kallara in 1908: \\"About 25 years ago, when the State needed additional money, it was thought expedient to open these chests and use the wealth they contained.\\" \\"A group of people\\" got together and attempted to enter the vaults with torches. When they found the vaults \\"infested with cobras\\" they \\"fled for their lives. In 2011, the antechamber to Kallara B was opened by the Observers appointed by the Supreme Court of India.The Hindu dated 29 June 2011 But the Observers could not open Kallara B. However, Gopal Subramanium in his report submitted to the Supreme Court in April 2014, recommended its opening after conducting another Devaprasnam. The two Pushpanjali Swamiyars are the highest spiritual dignitaries of Padmanabha Swamy Temple. The Pushpanjali Swamiyar of Naduvil Madhom sent letters to the Chairperson of the Administrative Committee and the Executive Officer on 8 February 2016 expressing his strong opposition to the opening of Kallara B.Mathrubhumi, Thiruvananthapuram Edition dated 26 February 2016 The Pushpanjali Swamiyar of Munchira Madhom led a Ratha Yathra from Kasaragod to Thiruvananthapuram in May 2018 campaigning against opening the sacred Kallara. Azhvanchery Thamprakkal, the supreme spiritual leader of Kerala Brahmins, while addressing a meeting held in connection with the Ratha Yathra, also demanded that faith should not be trampled upon by opening Kallara B.Mathrubhumi and Malayala Manorama, Thiruvananthapuram Edition dated 14 May 2018 According to a report by former Comptroller and Auditor General of India Vinod Rai, at least the outer door to Kallara B has been opened a number of times in recent decades - twice in 1991 and five times in 2002. Once Vinod Rai's report was out, Princess Aswathi Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi clarified that Mr Rai was referring to the antechamber to Kallara B, which was opened even in 2011 by the Supreme Court-appointed observers.Malayala Manorama Daily, 13 August 2014 Controversies The Kerala High Court ruled in 2011 that the state government should take over the control of the temple and its assets, but the Travancore royal family appealed to the Supreme Court.Temple Riches: Render unto Padmanabhaswamy ‚Äì The Economist, 19 February 2013 An independent report was commissioned, and was completed in November 2012,Supreme Court of India, in the matter of Sri Marthanda Varma v T P Sundararajan AND Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma v Union of India ‚Äì November 2012 finding no evidence that the royal family were expropriating the treasures. As of end-April 2016, vaults B, G, and H along with their several ante-chambers were yet to be opened; while inventorying of the items in vaults C, D, E, and F were completed (in August 2012) and formal inventorying of vault A had commenced. Several hundred pots and other items made of gold, that are used for daily rituals or intermittently for ceremonies in the Temple, were not inventoried as the Temple-priests expressed strong objections. Over 1.02 lakh \\"articles\\" had been retrieved from Vault A and its ante-chambers, till that point, though only a small part of them had been inventoried then. An \\"article\\" could be either an individual item, or collections of several items, examples of the latter being a cache of 1,95,000 'Rassappanams' (Gold coins) weighing 800 kg and sets of Navaratnas (collections of nine different kinds of diamonds). There are over 60,000 fully precious stones, set as parts of larger pieces of gold jewellery, amongst those items inventoried as of March 2013. The results of the inventory are not to be released until the completion of the whole process by order of the Supreme Court of India. In April 2014, Amicus Curiae advocate Gopal Subramaniam filed a 577-page report to the Supreme court of India alleging malpractices in the administration of the temple. According to him, the authorities failed to perform their ethical duties by opening many bank accounts, trusts and also not filing Income Tax returns for the past ten years. He alleged that Vault B was opened despite a previous ruling of the Supreme court prohibiting the same. The report states ‚Äì \\"The large amount of gold and silver, the discovery of which was a shock to the Amicus Curiae, is a singular instance of mismanagement. The presence of a gold plating machine is also yet another unexplained circumstance. This discovery raises a doubt of the organized extraction by persons belonging to the highest echelons. There appears to be resistance on the part of the entire State apparatus in effectively addressing the said issues. The lack of adequate investigation by the police is a telling sign that although Thiruvananthapuram is a city in the State of Kerala, parallelism based on monarchic rule appears to predominate the social psyche.\\" The Supreme court bench comprising justice R. M. Lodha and justice A. K. Patnaik ordered a change in administration by forming a 5-member committee and appointing Vinod Rai as auditor. The committee will include Thiruvananthapuram District judge K. P. Indira, Thantri and Nambi of the temple and two members to be decided in consultation with the Government of Kerala. Additionally, IAS officer and former administrator of the temple, K. N. Satish was appointed as executive officer. The Government of Kerala agreed to comply with the Supreme court order. Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma remains the trustee of the temple and still does the ritual duties as the titular Maharaja of Travancore, but has no responsibility regarding the temple management after the interim ruling by the Supreme Court The report also found the existence of two more vaults that were never even made mention of or hitherto spoken about. The report named them Vault 'G' and Vault 'H'. Like Vault 'B' and all its antechambers, both these vaults and their antechambers were yet to have been opened, as of May 2014. The report also mentions that Mr. Subramanian found several large trunks filled with artefacts made of precious metals and precious stones outside of the eight vaults and their antechambers. The CBI and the Intelligence Bureau have red-flagged the appointment of Gopal Subramaniam as a Judge in the Supreme Court. The IB cites Mr Subramaniam's report on Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple as one of the instances where he relied heavily on his spiritual instincts rather than rational logic and hard facts.The Economic Times, 25 June 2014 In his second report on Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple, Mr Subramaniam himself reveals,\\"It was his morning ritual of [shutting] his mind and seeking guidance, which resulted in discoveries in this direction.\\"Report of the Amicus Curiae, Pg 9 The Amicus Curiae has also been accused of conducting poojas in the Temple in violation of its customs. He performed poojas at the Thevarappura in the Temple and in front of the Vedavyasa Shrine. Despite opposition from the Royal Family and the Tantries of the Temple, he pulled out a stone Yantra from the nearby Marthandan Madhom Palace and did pooja on it for several days. The Tantries explained that the Yantram had no connection with the Padmanabhaswami Temple and that it was for the protection of the Palace. But the Amicus Curiae insisted on having it installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum of the Temple. Due to severe opposition from the Tantries the Yantram remains where it was. Every morning, Lord Padmanabha is to be awakened only by blowing the conch shell and chanting the Sripada Sooktham. But the Amicus Curiae introduced the daily rendering of Venkatesa Suprabhatam to awaken the Lord. The Supreme Court requested the Tantri to take the final decision on whether the Suprabhatam could be sung. Following that, the Senior Tantri Nedumpilli Tharananalloor Parameswaran Namboothiripad directed the Temple authorities to stop the chanting of Suprabhatam forthwith, as it was causing 'Anya Mantra Yajana Dosham' (affliction due to worshipping the Deity with incompatible mantras) to the Presiding Deity and the Temple. As atonement for this dosham, the Tantri wants Vedic scholars to chant 12 'muras' each of Rig Veda and Yajur Veda. In his first report to the Supreme Court, the Amicus Curiae directed the Tantries to examine whether a Sri Yantra can be installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum, in front of the utsava moorthi.Report of the Amicus Curiae, Pg 63 On 13 July 2020, overturning the January 2011 judgment of the Kerala high court, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the Padmanabhaswamy Temple administration and control would be done by the erstwhile Travancore royal family.

Nicknamed \\"Romerito\\" he was one of South America's top ranked lightweights during the 1980s. Professional boxing career Orlando Romero began his professional career as a boxer on February 24, 1979, defeating Rafael Pando by a six round decision in Lima. Romero won his first four bouts, then drew (tied) with Miguel Macias after six rounds, on July 21. Only two weeks later, on August 3, he started another winning streak, when he beat Luis Carhuamaca by decision in six, also in Lima. On October 22, he had his first bout outside Lima, when he knocked out Carlos Soriano in the second round at Trujillo. After four additional wins, Romero returned to Lima, where he defeated Domingo Gonzalez on April 19, 1980, by a knockout in six rounds, to win the Peruvian national Lightweight title. After two more victories, Romero added the Latin American Lightweight title with a twelve round decision victory over Leonidas Asprilla, who also fought Aaron Pryor, by a decision in twelve, on September 20 in Lima. Romero had fourteen more victories in a row before challenging Ray Mancini for the WBA world Lightweight title. Among the fighters he beat were Oscar Huertas (twice), Antonio Cruz (against whom Romero retained the Latin American Lightweight title by a twelve round decision on May 17, 1982 in Lima) and Jerome Artis. On September 15, 1983, Romero had his first world title try, and his first fight abroad, when he challenged Mancini for the WBA world Lightweight championship, at New York's Madison Square Garden. Romero was attempting to become Peru's first world boxing champion in history. After eight rounds, the fight was close, with one judge (Nicasio Drake), having it a 77-77 tie, while two judges, (Ismael W. Fernandez and Yusaku Yoshida) having Mancini ahead by 77-76 and 79-77, respectively, but Mancini retained the title when he knocked Romero out in the ninth round. Having won 26 bouts in a row, Romero had been inflicted his first defeat as a professional boxer. Romero gained some celebrity outside Peru after this bout, with Ring En Espa√±ol dedicating various articles to the Peruvian boxer. On January 14, 1984, he outpointed former Samuel Serrano world title challenger Benedicto Villablanca over ten rounds in Trujillo. He followed that win with a ten round decision on May 4 over Robert Mullins, who had also boxed H√©ctor Camacho. After one more win, he lost to another well known Peruvian boxer, the then up and coming Geronimo Luque, by a knockout in nine rounds on December 1, at Lima. Romero lost four of his last five fights, all against name opponents: on October 5, 1985, he was defeated by future Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez world title challenger Angel Hernandez by a sixth round knockout in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. Two months later, on December 3, he lost to another Puerto Rican, Miguel Santana (who challenged Greg Haugen for the IBF's world Lightweight title), losing by a fourth round knockout. After a two year lay-off following those two defeats, Romero returned to boxing, meeting Leonidas Asprillas' younger brother, Aquilles Asprilla, for the WBC's regional, Fecarbox title. Asprilla outpointed Romero over twelve rounds on July 17, 1987, in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Romero had another two year lay-off from boxing before returning for one more fight: trying to win the South American Lightweight title, he was knocked out in the second round by Oscar Benavides Muniz on October 31, 1989 in Chile, after which he retired for good. Romero won 34 bouts, losing 6 and drawing in 1, with 12 wins by knockout. After boxing In 1998, Romero moved to Spain, where he operates a Peruvian food restaurant.

Between 1949 and 2011, it was based in Brussels (Belgium); since 2011, it is based in Lausanne (Switzerland). It is the only international federation with more than 50 sports on its competition program. The FISU stages its events every two years. They currently include two Universiades (summer and winter) and 34 World University Championships.

History FISU was officially formed in 1949, but its origin goes back to the 1920s when the Frenchman, Jean Petitjean, organized the first \\"World Student Games\\" in Paris, France in May 1923. The following year saw the birth of the International Confederation of Students (ICS), which held a congress in Warsaw, Poland. Several delegations took part and the movement was launched. From 1925 to 1939, many great sporting events were organized by the students and the ICS: in Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1925, Rome, Italy in 1927, then again in Paris, Darmstadt, Germany (1930), Turin, Italy (1933), Budapest, Hungary (1935), Paris (1937) and Monaco (1939). The Second World War interrupted these meetings, but when peace was restored, France re-launched the World University Games. The peace was relative, and the shadow of the Cold War soon divided university sport. In 1946, the International Students Union (ISU) was created in Prague to pursue the works of the International Confederation of Students, and it organised the 9th World University Games in 1947. After those games, the increasing politicisation of the ISU led to a division within the university sports movement. In 1948, the International University Sports Federation (FISU) was created under the impetus of Paul Schleimer of Luxembourg, and it launched the International University Sport Weeks in 1949 in Meran, Italy. Other editions followed: in Luxembourg (1951), Dortmund (1953) and San Sebasti√°n (1955). In 1957, the French federation organised a World University Sports Championship which brought together students from the Eastern and Western blocks. From this meet arose the desire to organise a universal event in which students from all over the world could participate. In 1959, FISU and the ISU agreed to participate in the games organised in Turin, Italy, by CUSI, the Italian Student Sports Association. The Italian organisers baptised these 1959 games as the 'Universiade'. They created the flag with a 'U' surrounded by stars, which was to begin its journey around the world, and replaced the national anthems at the medal- awarding ceremonies with Gaudeamus Igitur. The Universiade in Turin was a success for the local Executive Committee, as well as for the man who was to change the future of the university sports movement, Dr. Primo Nebiolo. During this Universiade, which brought together 43 countries and 1,400 participants, many non-member federations applied to become members of FISU. However, even though university sport was developing in a peaceful environment, the modus vivendi still needed to be established. In addition to the agreement that had been made concerning national symbols (neither flags nor anthems) and the programme, FISU defined its philosophy in article 2 of its statutes by stipulating: 'FISU pursues its objects without consideration or discrimination of a political, denominational or racial nature'. From then on, FISU was to organise the games at worldwide level.FISU Statutes Retrieved 2016-01-19. Ever since this important period, the Universiades have continued to attract more and more participants. Starting with a total of 1,407 participants in Turin, Italy, in 1959, FISU reached a total of 6,757 participants from more than 165 countries in Beijing, China, in 2001, and 6,643 participants from 174 countries in Daegu, Korea, in 2003. The highest number of participants was registered at the 2013 Summer Universiade in Kazan, Russia, i.e. 11,759 representing 159 countries. The Winter Universiades have experienced the same success. In fact, statistics show that 98 athletes participated in the games in Zell am See, Austria, in 1958, while a record of 2,668 participants from 52 countries came to the Winter Universiade in Trentino, Italy, in 2013. The expansion of university sport around the world created a new need for meets and competitions to complete the Universiade programme. As a consequence, FISU launched the World University Championships (WUC) in the early sixties. Over 50 years, more than 300 championships have been organised, covering a large range of events (almost always different from the Universiade sports) and gathering participants from all over the world. Meant to guarantee continuity in the competition programme, these championships take place on even-numbered years and experience an increasing success over the years. They allow a large number of students and university sports leaders to get together on occasions other than Universiades. In 2000, 20 World University Championships were held in different places for different sports, attracting 3,623 participants. In 2002, 24 World University Championships were held, attracting 4,228 participants from 83 countries. In 2010, 27 championships were staged, bringing together 4,431 participants. For 2014, 29 WUC were attributed. In 2011, the International University Sports Federation moved its headquarters from Brussels, Belgium to Lausanne, Switzerland. Starting early March and running until mid-December, the 2014 World University Championships included 28 events in a single year, this time in 23 countries and over the 5 continents (17 Europe, 7 Asia, 2 America, 1 Africa and 1 Oceania). The Championships took place for the first time in Belarus, India, Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Singapore. The most recent edition of the Summer Universiade was held in Naples, Italy, in the Summer 2019. Meanwhile, the most recent Winter Universiade was held in Krasnoyarsk, Russia. The 2021 edition of the Summer Universiade will be organised in Chengdu, China, while the 2021 Winter Universiade's host will be Lucerne, Switzerland. Organisation FISU is composed of a General Assembly which represents the members (174 National University Sports Federations) and is FISU's main governing body. This group elects the Executive Committee for a period of four years, which takes all the necessary decisions for the smooth running of FISU. Ten permanent commissions advise the Executive Committee in their specialised areas and so to simplify its duties. FISU is funded through subscription, organising and entry fees, television incomes, and marketing activities. The FISU President is currently Oleg Matytsin.

The FISU Summer Universiade Conference is a key FISU event as it allows many of the student-athletes who compete in the Universiade to take part in an international academic conference. It fosters the academic spirit in the sports arena. The FISU Summer Universiade Conference is open to all accredited participants of the Universiade. The FISU Winter Universiade Conference Along with the Winter Universiade, FISU provides the organising committee with the opportunity to host a scientific conference. It is an opportunity for the young generation of sport scientists to discuss new ideas or to arrange projects/cooperative efforts in the area of sports science. The FISU Forum Like the Universiade, the Conference is biennial. This is why FISU decided to give students and university sports officials the opportunity to meet more often to discuss subjects involving education, culture and sport, through the FISU Forum. The Forum takes place every two years, alternating with the Universiade years, each time in a different location. The FISU Sport Education Summit The FISU Sport Education Summit gathers university rectors from around the world during two days to discuss the place of sport within higher education systems. The main aims of this event are to exchange ideas regarding the development of university sport and to understand the way university sport is organised in the different parts of the world. The FISU Seminars Seminars are divided into two types, one for the future event organisers and one for the newly nominated members of the FISU.

The design, the details of which are military secrets known to only a handful of major nations, is believed to be used in virtually all modern nuclear weapons that make up the arsenals of the major nuclear powers. History =Teller's \\"Super\\"= Physicist Edward Teller was for many years the chief force lobbying for research into developing fusion weapons. The idea of using the energy from a fission device to begin a fusion reaction was first proposed by the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi to his colleague Edward Teller in the fall of 1941 during what would soon become the Manhattan Project, the World War II effort by the United States and United Kingdom to develop the first nuclear weapons. Teller soon was a participant at Robert Oppenheimer's summer conference on the development of a fission bomb held at the University of California, Berkeley, where he guided discussion towards the idea of creating his \\"Super\\" bomb, which would hypothetically be many times more powerful than the yet- undeveloped fission weapon. Teller assumed creating the fission bomb would be nothing more than an engineering problem, and that the \\"Super\\" provided a much more interesting theoretical challenge. Ivy King, the largest pure fission bomb tested by the US, yielding 500 kt (November 16, 1952) For the remainder of the war the effort was focused on first developing fission weapons. Nevertheless, Teller continued to pursue the \\"Super\\", to the point of neglecting work assigned to him for the fission weapon at the secret Los Alamos lab where he worked. (Much of the work Teller declined to do was given instead to Klaus Fuchs, who was later discovered to be a spy for the Soviet Union.Rhodes, Dark Sun, p. 430.) Teller was given some resources with which to study the \\"Super\\", and contacted his friend Maria G√∂ppert-Mayer to help with laborious calculations relating to opacity. The \\"Super\\", however, proved elusive, and the calculations were incredibly difficult to perform, especially since there was no existing way to run small-scale tests of the principles involved (in comparison, the properties of fission could be more easily probed with cyclotrons, newly created nuclear reactors, and various other tests). Even though they had witnessed the Trinity test, after the atomic bombings of Japan scientists at Los Alamos were surprised by how devastating the effects of the weapon had been.Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, p. 35. Many of the scientists rebelled against the notion of creating a weapon thousands of times more powerful than the first atomic bombs. For the scientists the question was in part technical ‚Äî the weapon design was still quite uncertain and unworkable ‚Äî and in part moral: such a weapon, they argued, could only be used against large civilian populations, and could thus only be used as a weapon of genocide. Many scientists, such as Teller's colleague Hans Bethe (who had discovered stellar nucleosynthesis, the nuclear fusion that takes place in stars), urged that the United States should not develop such weapons and set an example towards the Soviet Union. Promoters of the weapon, including Teller and Berkeley physicists Ernest Lawrence and Luis Alvarez, argued that such a development was inevitable, and to deny such protection to the people of the United States ‚Äî especially when the Soviet Union was likely to create such a weapon itself ‚Äî was itself an immoral and unwise act. Still others, such as Oppenheimer, simply thought that the existing stockpile of fissile material was better spent in attempting to develop a large arsenal of tactical atomic weapons rather than potentially squandered on the development of a few massive \\"Supers\\".(Galison and Bernstein 1989) In any case, work slowed greatly at Los Alamos, as some 5,500 of the 7,100 scientists and related staff who had been there at the conclusion of the war left to go back to their previous positions at universities and laboratories.Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, pp. 89‚Äì90. A conference was held at Los Alamos in 1946 to examine the feasibility of building a Super; it concluded that it was feasible, but there were a number of dissenters to that conclusion. When the Soviet Union exploded their own atomic bomb (dubbed \\"Joe 1\\" by the US) in August 1949, it caught Western analysts off guard, and over the next several months there was an intense debate within the US government, military, and scientific communities on whether to proceed with the far-more-powerful Super.Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, pp. 1‚Äì2. On January 31, 1950, US President Harry S. Truman ordered a program to develop a hydrogen bomb.Rhodes, Dark Sun, pp. 406‚Äì408. Many scientists returned to Los Alamos to work on the \\"Super\\" program, but the initial attempts still seemed highly unworkable. In the \\"classical Super,\\" it was thought that the heat alone from the fission bomb would be used to ignite the fusion material, but thar proved to be impossible. For a while, many scientists thought (and many hoped) that the weapon itself would be impossible to construct.Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, p. 91. =Ulam's and Teller's contributions= The exact history of the Teller‚ÄìUlam breakthrough is not completely known, partly because of numerous conflicting personal accounts and also by the continued classification of documents that would reveal which was closer to the truth. Previous models of the \\"Super\\" had apparently placed the fusion fuel either surrounding the fission \\"trigger\\" (in a spherical formation) or at the heart of it (similar to a \\"boosted\\" weapon) in the hopes that the closer the fuel was to the fission explosion, the higher the chance it would ignite the fusion fuel by the sheer force of the heat generated. In 1951, after still many years of fruitless labor on the \\"Super\\", a breakthrough idea from the Polish √©migr√© mathematician Stanislaw Ulam was seized upon by Teller and developed into the first workable design for a megaton-range hydrogen bomb. This concept, now called \\"staged implosion\\" was first proposed in a classified scientific paper, On Heterocatalytic Detonations I. Hydrodynamic Lenses and Radiation MirrorsThe term \\"heterocatalytic\\" was Teller and Ulam's jargon for their new idea; using an atomic explosion to ignite a secondary explosion in a mass of fuel located outside the initiating bomb. on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Institute website. This is the original classified paper by Teller and Ulam proposing staged implosion. This declassified version is heavily redacted, leaving only a few paragraphs. by Teller and Ulam on March 9, 1951. The exact amount of contribution provided respectively from Ulam and Teller to what became known as the \\"Teller‚ÄìUlam design\\" is not definitively known in the public domain‚Äîthe degree of credit assigned to Teller by his contemporaries is almost exactly commensurate with how well they thought of Teller in general. In an interview with Scientific American from 1999, Teller told the reporter: > I contributed; Ulam did not. I'm sorry I had to answer it in this abrupt > way. Ulam was rightly dissatisfied with an old approach. He came to me with > a part of an idea which I already had worked out and difficulty getting > people to listen to. He was willing to sign a paper. When it then came to > defending that paper and really putting work into it, he refused. He said, > \\"I don't believe in it.\\"*Gary Stix, \\"Infamy and honor at the Atomic Caf√©: > Edward Teller has no regrets about his contentious career,\\" Scientific > American (October 1999): p. A view of the Sausage device casing, with its diagnostic and cryogenic equipment attached. The long pipes would receive the first bits of radiation from the primary and secondary (\\"Teller light\\") just before the device fully detonated. The issue is controversial. Bethe in his ‚ÄúMemorandum on the History of the Thermonuclear Program‚Äù (1952) cited Teller as the discoverer of an ‚Äúentirely new approach to thermonuclear reactions‚Äù, which ‚Äúwas a matter of inspiration‚Äù and was ‚Äútherefore, unpredictable‚Äù and ‚Äúlargely accidental.‚Äù At the Oppenheimer hearing, in 1954, Bethe spoke of Teller's ‚Äústroke of genius‚Äù in the invention of the H-bomb. And finally in 1997 Bethe stated that ‚Äúthe crucial invention was made in 1951, by Teller.‚Äù * H.A. Bethe, \\" J. Robert Oppenheimer 1904‚Äì1967,\\" National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Biographical Memoirs (1997, vol. 71, pp. 175‚Äì218; on 197) Other scientists (antagonistic to Teller, such as J. Carson Mark) have claimed that Teller would have never gotten any closer without the idea of Ulam. The nuclear weapons designer Ted Taylor was clear about assigning credit for the basic staging and compression ideas to Ulam, while giving Teller the credit for recognizing the critical role of radiation as opposed to hydrodynamic pressure. Teller became known in the press as the \\"father of the hydrogen bomb\\", a title which he did not seek to discourage. Many of Teller's colleagues were irritated that he seemed to enjoy taking full credit for something he had only a part in, and in response, with encouragement from Enrico Fermi, Teller authored an article titled \\"The Work of Many People,\\" which appeared in Science magazine in February 1955, emphasizing that he was not alone in the weapon's development (he would later write in his memoirs that he had told a \\"white lie\\" in the 1955 article, and would imply that he should receive full credit for the weapon's invention).\\"Edward Teller's Memoirs: a book review by S. Uchii\\", PHS Newsletter (Philosophy and History of Science, Kyoto University), no. 52, July 22, 2003 Hans Bethe, who also participated in the hydrogen bomb project, once drolly said, \\"For the sake of history, I think it is more precise to say that Ulam is the father, because he provided the seed, and Teller is the mother, because he remained with the child. As for me, I guess I am the midwife.\\"Schweber, S.S. In the shadow of the bomb: Bethe, Oppenheimer, and the moral responsibility of the scientist (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2000). ; p. 166) The dry-fuel device detonated in the \\"Castle Bravo\\" shot demonstrated that the Teller‚ÄìUlam design could be made deployable, but also that the final fission stage created large amounts of nuclear fallout. The Teller‚ÄìUlam breakthrough‚Äîthe details of which are still classified‚Äîwas apparently the separation of the fission and fusion components of the weapons, and to use the radiation produced by the fission bomb to first compress the fusion fuel before igniting it. Some sources have suggested that Ulam initially proposed compressing the secondary through the shock waves generated by the primary and that it was Teller who then realized that the radiation from the primary would be able to accomplish the task (hence \\"radiation implosion\\"). However, compression alone would not have been enough and the other crucial idea, staging the bomb by separating the primary and secondary, seems to have been exclusively contributed by Ulam. The elegance of the design impressed many scientists, to the point that some who previously wondered if it were feasible suddenly believed it was inevitable and that it would be created by both the US and the Soviet Union. Even Oppenheimer, who was originally opposed to the project, called the idea \\"technically sweet.\\" The \\"George\\" shot of Operation Greenhouse in 1951 tested the basic concept for the first time on a very small scale (and the next shot in the series, \\"Item,\\" was the first boosted fission weapon), raising expectations to a near certainty that the concept would work. On November 1, 1952, the Teller‚ÄìUlam configuration was tested in the \\"Ivy Mike\\" shot at an island in the Enewetak atoll, with a yield of 10.4 megatons (over 450 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Nagasaki during World War II). The device, dubbed the Sausage, used an extra-large fission bomb as a \\"trigger\\" and liquid deuterium, kept in its liquid state by 20 tons of cryogenic equipment, as its fusion fuel, and it had a mass ify around 80 tons altogether. An initial press blackout was attempted, but it was soon announced that the US had detonated a megaton-range hydrogen bomb. Like the Bravo test, Castle Romeo \\"ran away,\\" producing a much higher yield than originally estimated (11 megatons instead of 4), making it the third largest test ever conducted by the US. The Romeo \\"shrimp\\" device derived its lithium deuteride from natural instead of \\"enriched\\" lithium The elaborate refrigeration plant necessary to keep its fusion fuel in a liquid state meant that the \\"Ivy Mike\\" device was too heavy and too complex to be of practical use. The first deployable Teller‚ÄìUlam weapon in the US would not be developed until 1954, when the liquid deuterium fuel of the \\"Ivy Mike\\" device would be replaced with a dry fuel of lithium deuteride and tested in the \\"Castle Bravo\\" shot (the device was codenamed the Shrimp). The dry lithium mixture performed much better than had been expected, and the \\"Castle Bravo\\" device that was detonated in 1954 had a yield two-and-a-half times greater than had been expected (at 15 Mt, it was also the most powerful bomb ever detonated by the United States). Because much of the yield came from the final fission stage of its uranium 238 tamper, it generated much nuclear fallout, which caused one of the worst nuclear accidents in US history after unforeseen weather patterns blew it over populated areas of the atoll and Japanese fishermen on board the Daigo Fukuryu Maru. After an initial period focused on making multi-megaton hydrogen bombs, efforts in the United States shifted towards developing miniaturized Teller‚ÄìUlam weapons which could outfit Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles and Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles. The last major design breakthrough in this respect was accomplished by the mid-1970s, when versions of the Teller‚ÄìUlam design were created which could fit on the end of a small MIRVed missile. =Soviet research= In the Soviet Union, the scientists working on their own hydrogen bomb project also ran into difficulties in developing a megaton-range fusion weapon. Because Klaus Fuchs had only been at Los Alamos at a very early stage of the hydrogen bomb design (before the Teller‚ÄìUlam configuration had been completed), none of his espionage information was of much use, and the Soviet physicists working on the project had to develop their weapon independently. The first Soviet fusion design, developed by Andrei Sakharov and Vitaly Ginzburg in 1949 (before the Soviets had a working fission bomb), was dubbed the Sloika, after a Russian layered puff pastry, and was not of the Teller‚ÄìUlam configuration, but rather used alternating layers of fissile material and lithium deuteride fusion fuel spiked with tritium (this was later dubbed Sakharov's \\"First Idea\\"). Though nuclear fusion was technically achieved, it did not have the scaling property of a \\"staged\\" weapon, and their first \\"hydrogen bomb\\" test, \\"Joe 4\\" is no longer considered to be a \\"true\\" hydrogen bomb, and is rather considered a hybrid fission/fusion device more similar to a large boosted fission weapon than a Teller‚ÄìUlam weapon (though using an order of magnitude more fusion fuel than a boosted weapon). Detonated in 1953 with a yield equivalent to 400 kilotons (only 15%‚Äì20% from fusion), the Sloika device did, however, have the advantage of being a weapon which could actually be delivered to a military target, unlike the \\"Ivy Mike\\" device, though it was never widely deployed. Teller had proposed a similar design as early as 1946, dubbed the \\"Alarm Clock\\" (meant to \\"wake up\\" research into the \\"Super\\"), though it was calculated to be ultimately not worth the effort and no prototype was ever developed or tested. Attempts to use a Sloika design to achieve megaton-range results proved unfeasible in the Soviet Union as it had in the calculations done in the US, but its value as a practical weapon since it was 20 times more powerful than their first fission bomb, should not be underestimated. The Soviet physicists calculated that at best the design might yield a single megaton of energy if it was pushed to its limits. After the US tested the \\"Ivy Mike\\" device in 1952, proving that a multimegaton bomb could be created, the Soviets searched for an additional design and continued to work on improving the Sloika (the \\"First Idea\\"). The \\"Second Idea\\", as Sakharov referred to it in his memoirs, was a previous proposal by Ginzburg in November 1948 to use lithium deuteride in the bomb, which would, by the bombardment by neutrons, produce tritium.*David Holloway, Stalin and the bomb: The Soviet Union and atomic energy, 1939‚Äì1956 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994). ; p. 299 and 314, respectively In late 1953, physicist Viktor Davidenko achieved the first breakthrough, that of keeping the primary and the secondary parts of the bombs in separate pieces (\\"staging\\"). The next breakthrough was discovered and developed by Sakharov and Yakov Zeldovich, that of using the X-rays from the fission bomb to compress the secondary before fusion (\\"radiation implosion\\"), in the spring of 1954. Sakharov's \\"Third Idea\\", as the Teller‚ÄìUlam design was known in the Soviet Union, was tested in the shot \\"RDS-37\\" in November 1955 with a yield of 1.6 Mt. If the Soviets had been able to analyze the fallout data from either the \\"Ivy Mike\\" or \\"Castle Bravo\\" tests, they could have been able to discern that the fission primary was being kept separate from the fusion secondary, a key part of the Teller‚ÄìUlam device, and perhaps that the fusion fuel had been subjected to high amounts of compression before detonation.(De Geer 1991) One of the key Soviet bomb designers, Yuli Khariton, later said: > At that time, Soviet research was not organized on a sufficiently high > level, and useful results were not obtained, although radiochemical analyses > of samples of fallout could have provided some useful information about the > materials used to produce the explosion. The relationship between certain > short-lived isotopes formed in the course of thermonuclear reactions could > have made it possible to judge the degree of compression of the > thermonuclear fuel, but knowing the degree of compression would not have > allowed Soviet scientists to conclude exactly how the exploded device had > been made, and it would not have revealed its design.Yuli Khariton and Yuri > Smirnov, \\"The Khariton version\\" Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Vol. 49, > No. 4 (May 1993): p.20 Fireball of the Tsar Bomba (RDS-220), the largest weapon ever detonated (1961). Dropped from over 10 km and detonated at 4 km high, its fireball would have touched the ground were it not for the shock wave from the explosion reflecting off the ground and striking the bottom of the fireball, and nearly reached as high as the altitude of the deploying Tu-95 bomber. The RDS-220 test demonstrated how \\"staging\\" could be used to develop arbitrarily powerful weapons. Sakharov stated in his memoirs that though he and Davidenko had fallout dust in cardboard boxes several days after the \\"Mike\\" test with the hope of analyzing it for information, a chemist at Arzamas-16 (the Soviet weapons laboratory) had mistakenly poured the concentrate down the drain before it could be analyzed. Only in the fall of 1952 did the Soviet Union set up an organized system for monitoring fallout data. Nonetheless, the memoirs also say that the yield from one of the American tests, which became an international incident involving Japan, told Sakharov that the US design was much better than theirs, and he decided that they must have exploded a separate fission bomb and somehow used its energy to compress the lithium deuteride. But how, he asked himself, can an explosion to one side be used to compress the ball of fusion fuel within 5% of symmetry? Then it hit him! Focus the X-rays! The Soviets demonstrated the power of the \\"staging\\" concept in October 1961 when they detonated the massive and unwieldy Tsar Bomba, a 50 Mt hydrogen bomb which derived almost 97% of its energy from fusion rather than fission‚Äîits uranium tamper was replaced with one of lead shortly before firing, in an effort to prevent excessive nuclear fallout. Had it been fired in its \\"full\\" form, it would have yielded at around 100 Mt. The weapon was technically deployable (it was tested by dropping it from a specially modified bomber), but militarily impractical, and was developed and tested primarily as a show of Soviet strength. It was the largest nuclear weapon developed and tested by any country. Other countries =United Kingdom= The details of the development of the Teller‚ÄìUlam design in other countries are less well known. In any event, the United Kingdom initially had difficulty in its development of it and failed in its first attempt in May 1957 (its \\"Grapple I\\" test failed to ignite as planned, but much of its energy came from fusion in its secondary). However, it succeeded in its second attempt in its November 1957 \\"Grapple X\\" test, which yielded 1.8 Mt. The British development of the Teller‚ÄìUlam design was apparently independent, but it was allowed to share in some US fallout data which may have been useful. After the successful detonation of a megaton-range device and thus its practical understanding of the Teller‚ÄìUlam design \\"secret,\\" the United States agreed to exchange some of its nuclear designs with the United Kingdom, which led to the 1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement. =China= The People's Republic of China detonated its first device using a Teller‚ÄìUlam design June 1967 (\\"Test No. 6\\"), a mere 32 months after detonating its first fission weapon (the shortest fission-to- fusion development yet known), with a yield of 3.3 Mt. Little is known about the Chinese thermonuclear program, however. =France= Very little is known about the French development of the Teller‚ÄìUlam design beyond the fact that it detonated a 2.6 Mt device in the \\"Canopus\\" test in August 1968. =India= On 11 May 1998, India announced that it has detonated a hydrogen bomb in its Operation Shakti tests (\\"Shakti I\\", specifically). Some non-Indian analysts, using seismographic readings, have suggested that it might not be the case by pointing at the low yield of the test, which they say is close to 30 kilotons (as opposed to 45 kilotons announced by India).\\"What Are the Real Yields of India's Test?\\", Nuclear Weapon Archive, November 2001 However, some non-Indian experts agree with India. Dr. Harold M. Agnew, former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, said that India's assertion of having detonated a staged thermonuclear bomb was believable. The British seismologist Roger Clarke argued that seismic magnitudes suggested a combined yield of up to 60 kilotonnes, consistent with the Indian announced total yield of 56 kilotonnes. Professor Jack Evernden, a US seismologist, has always maintained that for correct estimation of yields, one should \\"account properly for geological and seismological differences between test sites.\\" His estimation of the yields of the Indian tests concur with those of India. Indian scientists have argued that some international estimations of the yields of India's nuclear tests are unscientific. India says that the yield of its tests were deliberately kept low to avoid civilian damage and that it can build staged thermonuclear weapons of various yields up to around 200 kilotons on the basis of those tests. Another cited reason for the low yields was that radioactivity released from yields significantly more than 45 kilotons might not have been contained fully. Even low-yield tests can have a bearing on thermonuclear capability, as they can provide information on the behavior of primaries without the full ignition of secondaries.\\"India's Nuclear Weapons Program: Operation Shakti, 1998, Nuclear Weapon Archive, March 2001 =North Korea= North Korea claimed to have tested its miniaturised thermonuclear bomb on January 6, 2016. North Korea's first three nuclear tests (2006, 2009 and 2013) had a relatively low yield and do not appear to have been of a thermonuclear weapon design. In 2013, the South Korean Defense Ministry has speculated that North Korea may be trying to develop a \\"hydrogen bomb\\" and such a device may be North Korea's next weapons test. In January 2016, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb, but only a magnitude 5.1 seismic event was detected at the time of the test, a similar magnitude to the 2013 test of a 6‚Äì9 kt atomic bomb. Those seismic recordings have scientists worldwide doubting North Korea's claim that a hydrogen bomb was tested and suggest it was a non-fusion nuclear test. On September 9, 2016, North Korea conducted their fifth nuclear test which yielded between 10 and 30 kilotons.https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-northkorea-nuclear- idUKKCN11F02Dhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world- asia-37314927http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-northkorea-nuclear-idUKKCN11F02D On September 3, 2017, North Korea conducted a sixth nuclear test just few hours after photographs of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspecting a device resembling a thermonuclear weapon warhead were released.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-41139741 Initial estimates in first few days were between 70 and 160 kilotonshttp://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2017/09/03/0200000000AEN20170903002700315.htmlhttps://www.norsar.no/press/latest- press-release/archive/large-nuclear-test-in-north-korea- on-3-september-2017-article1534-984.htmlhttps://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/09/06/national/north- korean-nuke-test-put-160-kilotons-ishiba-urges-debate-deploying-u-s-atomic- bombs/http://thediplomat.com/2017/09/us-intelligence-north-koreas-sixth-test- was-a-140-kiloton-advanced-nuclear-device/ and were raised over a week later to range of 250 to over 300 kilotons.https://www.norsar.no/press/latest-press- release/archive/the-nuclear-explosion-in-north-korea- on-3-september-2017-a-revised-magnitude-assessment- article1548-984.htmlhttp://www.38north.org/2017/09/punggye091217/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/north- korea-nuclear-test-maybe-have-been-twice-as-strong-as-first- thought/2017/09/13/19b026d8-985b-11e7-a527-3573bd073e02_story.htmlhttp://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/1203852/sar- image-of-punggye-ri/ Jane's Information Group estimated, based mainly on visual analysis of propaganda pictures, that the bomb might weigh between 250 and 360 kilograms (~550 ‚Äì 790 lbs.).http://www.janes.com/images/assets/111/75111/North_Korea_bargains_with_nuclear_diplomacy.pdf Public knowledge W80 nuclear warhead, allow for some speculation as to the relative size and shapes of the primaries and the secondaries in US thermonuclear weapons. The Teller‚ÄìUlam design was for many years considered one of the top nuclear secrets, and even today, it is not discussed in any detail by official publications with origins \\"behind the fence\\" of classification. The policy of the US Department of Energy (DOE) policy has always been not to acknowledge when \\"leaks\\" occur since doing such would acknowledge the accuracy of the supposed leaked information. Aside from images of the warhead casing but never of the \\"physics package\\" itself, most information in the public domain about the design is relegated to a few terse statements and the work of a few individual investigators. Here is a short discussion of the events that led to the formation of the \\"public\\" models of the Teller‚ÄìUlam design, with some discussions as to their differences and disagreements with those principles outlined above. = Early knowledge = The general principles of the \\"classical Super\\" design were public knowledge even before thermonuclear weapons were first tested. After Truman ordered the crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb in January 1950, the Boston Daily Globe published a cutaway description of a hypothetical hydrogen bomb with the caption Artist's conception of how H-bomb might work using atomic bomb as a mere \\"trigger\\" to generate enough heat to set up the H-bomb's \\"thermonuclear fusion\\" process. ‚Äì reprinted in The fact that a large proportion of the yield of a thermonuclear device stems from the fission of a uranium 238 tamper (fission-fusion-fission principle) was revealed when the Castle Bravo test \\"ran away,\\" producing a much higher yield than originally estimated and creating large amounts of nuclear fallout. =DOE statements= In 1972, the DOE declassified a statement that \\"The fact that in thermonuclear (TN) weapons, a fission 'primary' is used to trigger a TN reaction in thermonuclear fuel referred to as a 'secondary'\\", and in 1979, ir added: \\"The fact that, in thermonuclear weapons, radiation from a fission explosive can be contained and used to transfer energy to compress and ignite a physically separate component containing thermonuclear fuel.\\" To the latter sentence, it specified, \\"Any elaboration of this statement will be classified.\\" (emphasis in original) The only statement that may pertain to the sparkplug was declassified in 1991: \\"Fact that fissile and/or fissionable materials are present in some secondaries, material unidentified, location unspecified, use unspecified, and weapons undesignated.\\" In 1998, the DOE declassified the statement that \\"The fact that materials may be present in channels and the term 'channel filler,' with no elaboration,\\" which may refer to the polystyrene foam (or an analogous substance). (DOE 2001, sect. V.C.) Whether the statements vindicate some or all of the models presented above is up for interpretation, and official US government releases about the technical details of nuclear weapons have been purposely equivocating in the past (such as the Smyth Report). Other information, such as the types of fuel used in some of the early weapons, has been declassified, bur precise technical information has not been. =The Progressive case= Most of the current ideas of the Teller‚ÄìUlam design came into public awareness after the DOE attempted to censor a magazine article by the anti-weapons activist Howard Morland in 1979 on the \\"secret of the hydrogen bomb.\\" In 1978, Morland had decided that discovering and exposing the \\"last remaining secret\\" would focus attention onto the arms race and allow citizens to feel empowered to question official statements on the importance of nuclear weapons and nuclear secrecy. Most of Morland's ideas about how the weapon worked were compiled from highly-accessible sources, the drawings that most inspired his approach came from the Encyclopedia Americana. Morland also interviewed, often informally, many former Los Alamos scientists (including Teller and Ulam, though neither gave him any useful information), and used a variety of interpersonal strategies to encourage informational responses from them (such as by asking questions such as \\"Do they still use sparkplugs?\\" even if he was unaware what the latter term specifically referred to). (Morland 1981) Morland eventually concluded that the \\"secret\\" was that the primary and secondary were kept separate and that radiation pressure from the primary compressed the secondary before igniting it. When an early draft of the article, to be published in The Progressive magazine, was sent to the DOE after it had fallen into the hands of a professor who was opposed to Morland's goal, the DOE requested that the article not be published and pressed for a temporary injunction. After a short court hearing in which the DOE argued that Morland's information was (1). likely derived from classified sources, (2). if not derived from classified sources, itself counted as \\"secret\\" information under the \\"born secret\\" clause of the 1954 Atomic Energy Act, and (3). dangerous and would encourage nuclear proliferation, Morland and his lawyers disagreed on all points, but the injunction was granted, as the judge in the case thought that it was safer to grant the injunction and allow Morland, et al., to appeal, which they did in United States v. The Progressive, et al. (1979). Through a variety of more complicated circumstances, the DOE case began to wane, as it became clear that some of the data it attempted to claim as \\"secret\\" had been published in a students' encyclopedia a few years earlier. After another hydrogen bomb speculator, Chuck Hansen, had his own ideas about the \\"secret\\" (quite different from Morland's) published in a Wisconsin newspaper, the DOE claimed The Progressive case was moot, dropped its suit, and allowed the magazine to publish, which it did in November 1979. Morland had by then, however, changed his opinion of how the bomb worked to suggesting that a foam medium (the polystyrene) rather than radiation pressure was used to compress the secondary and that in the secondary was a sparkplug of fissile material as well. He published the changes, based in part on the proceedings of the appeals trial, as a short erratum in The Progressive a month later. , The Progressive, vol. 43, no. 11, November 1979 In 1981, Morland published a book, The secret that exploded, about his experience, describing in detail the train of thought which led him to his conclusions about the \\"secret.\\" Because the DOE sought to censor Morland's work, one of the few times that it violated its usual approach of not acknowledging \\"secret\\" material that had been released, it is interpreted as being at least partially correct, but to what degree it lacks information or has incorrect information is not known with any great confidence. The difficulty which a number of nations had in developing the Teller‚ÄìUlam design (even when they understood the design, such as with the United Kingdom) makes it somewhat unlikely that the simple information alone is what provides the ability to manufacture thermonuclear weapons. Nevertheless, the ideas put forward by Morland in 1979 have been the basis for all current speculation on the Teller‚ÄìUlam design.

He was first probably the governor of the Rhodopes domain of the Second Bulgarian Empire, and then an autocrat in these lands. He was first mentioned as one of the nobles disputing Tsar Boril's ascension to the Bulgarian throne. He married the daughter of Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders in November 1208, leaving Veliko Tarnovo and establishing himself as an independent ruler over the most part of the Rhodope Mountains. Alexius Slav became a vassal of Henry after the Bulgarian defeat near Plovdiv. Henry promised to support his aspirations for the Bulgarian throne and awarded Alexius Slav the title of despot. In 1211, he fought against Boril together with the Despotate of Epirus, extending the territory of his state and capturing the fortress of Melnik, where he moved his capital from Tsepina in 1215, and became an autocrat. In Melnik, Alexius Slav had a royal court of his own; the court consisted of Bulgarians as well as Franks (a sebastos of the Franks was mentioned in one contemporary epigraph). Despot Alexius Slav is also known to have issued a charter donating a feudal possession to the nearby Monastery of the Mother of God Speliotissa in 1220. In this document, Alexius Slav called the monastery despot's and tsar's, hinting at his confidence and power. His state became once again a part of the Bulgarian Empire after the Battle of Klokotnitsa on 9 March 1230; after December 1228, his name was no longer mentioned in the historical sources. Some scholars link him to the stolnik Slav from a later ring inscription unearthed in Tarnovo, but this identification is unreliable according to historian Ivan Bozhilov. Alexius Slav was married twice: first to an unknown illegitimate daughter of Henry of Flanders and then, after her death, to the daughter of a Petraliphas, brother- in-law to the ruler of Epirus (and after 1225 Emperor of Thessalonica) Theodore Komnenos Doukas (perhaps the sebastokrator John Petraliphas). The sources give no information about any progeny. Honours Slav Point on Oscar II Coast in Graham Land, Antarctica is named after Alexius Slav.

Career Born in Stepney, London, Groves started his career at east London non-league clubs Leytonstone and Walthamstow Avenue, and then briefly as an amateur for Tottenham Hotspur before signing professional forms with Leyton Orient in 1954. Playing as an inside forward, his regular goalscoring for Orient soon attracted the attention of Arsenal, who signed him in November 1955 for ¬£23,000, at the time a very high figure. He scored on his debut, against Sheffield United on 12 November 1955, in a 2-1 First Division win (Don Roper grabbing the other Arsenal goal). Despite an eye-catching start, Groves initially struggled to live up to expectations at Arsenal, his first season at the club hampered by injury, first to a knee and then to his back. It wasn't until the 1958-59 season, that he had established a regular place. Groves scored ten goals that season, and formed a useful attacking partnership with David Herd. The season after that, he was switched to wing half, where he played for the rest of his career; Groves was also made Arsenal captain, following the departure of Dave Bowen. His spell at Arsenal was continually hampered by injury; although when he did play he impressed, enough so that he was selected for the London XI that played (and lost to) Barcelona in the first Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final in 1958. Groves lost his first-team place in the 1961-62 season, although he stayed at Arsenal as a bit-part player until the summer of 1964, when he left to sign for Southern League side Canterbury City. In all he played 201 times for Arsenal, scoring 37 goals. Although he represented England at amateur and youth level, he never won a full cap. Whilst a player, Groves ran a garage, just off Blackstock Road, close to the Arsenal ground. After retiring from playing Groves left the game completely, running a pub and working in insurance. His nephew, Perry Groves, played for Arsenal in the 1980s and 1990s, helping them win two league titles and a Football League Cup.

By 1967 information, Protestant communities were represented mainly within South Vietnam. Those communities included the French Reformed Church, Anglican- Episcopalian, Christian and Missionary Alliance, Baptists, Churches of Christ, Worldwide Evangelization Crusade, and Seventh-day Adventists. Other Protestant associations were also represented in some social services and welfare agencies. In 1967 there were 150,000 Protestant adherents in South Vietnam, representing about 1% of the total population.Protestantism in South Vietnam, US Navy, Bureau of Naval Personnel, Chaplains Division, 1967 Several Protestant church properties were confiscated during the communist takeover of South Vietnam in 1975, including the seminaries in Nha Trang and Hanoi. Hundreds of Protestant churches were also destroyed in this period. All Protestant denominations in Vietnam were gathered by local communist government into a single organization called the Evangelical Church of Vietnam in 1975, which had around 500,000 official members in 1997. However, in 1988, a house church movement began when some active pastors were expelled from the official churches. One of the most prominent from those pastors was Tran Dinh Ai, whose movement reached 16,000 members and 165 churches (by 1997).FVA News Bible societies in Vietnam Protestants made several Bible translations in 1926 and 1991, and translated separate books of Old Testament and New Testament into Vietnamese.History of the Vietnamese Bible, by Phuoc Nguyen, extracted from Linh Luc journal (January, 1996), Vietnamese Baptist The organized work of United Bible Societies in Vietnam began in 1890.

Growth of the faith has been most dramatic among ethnic minority peoples (Montagnards) such as the Mnong, E De, Jarai, and Bahnar. Pressure was reportedly put on Protestants in several northwestern villages to recant their faith in 2005, though there are fewer reports than in years past. Unsanctioned church meetings are routinely broken up and its members detained and harassed. In April 2001, the government gave official recognition to the Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam. In 2005, hundreds of house churches that had been ordered to shut down in 2001, were quietly allowed to reopen. Over 100 refugees fled to Cambodia in the wake of a crackdown over large protests against land confiscation and a lack of religious freedom.

At least 54 people remain imprisoned due to their faith, including some Protestants.

She is noted for her contributions to different genres of films and different roles from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Her accolades consist of a National Film Award, 2 Filmfare Awards out of 9 nominations, the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award and the Centenary Award for Indian Film Personality. Throughout her career, she has been frequently cited as one of Bollywood's greatest, most influential and most beautiful actresses by various media outlets, titles for which she has received substantial publicity. Although Rehman achieved her film debut in the Telugu film Rojulu Marayi (1955), she received recognition for her work in Hindi films directed as well as produced by Guru Dutt, which included C.I.D (1956), Pyaasa (1957), Kaagaz Ke Phool (1959), Chaudhvin Ka Chand (1960) and Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam (1962), for which she received her first Filmfare nomination. She continued acting in the mid-1960s, starring in successful movies and establishing herself as one of the leading ladies in classic Indian cinema. Rehman's career reached its apex when she won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress twice, for the Bollywood classic Guide (1965) and romantic thriller Neel Kamal (1968) and received nominations for Ram Aur Shyam (1967) and Khamoshi (1970), the latter of which is considered to be her greatest performance ever. She also starred in Satyajit Ray's Abhijan (1962) and with Raj Kapoor in the acclaimed Teesri Kasam (1966). Despite winning the National Film Award for Best Actress for portraying a clanswoman in love with a separate clansman in the commercially-underwhelming Reshma Aur Shera (1971), her career came to a standstill when she was reduced to motherly, supporting roles in films starting from Phagun (1973). Rehman's further notable performances are Kabhi Kabhie (1976), Namkeen (1982), Chandni (1989) and Lamhe (1991), and the latter film became her last film credit in the next 11 years until 2002, when she returned to the film industry. In 2011, the Government of India honoured Rehman with the Padma Bhushan, the third-highest civilian award of the country , adding to her previous honour Padma Shri conferred to her in 1972. Apart from acting, Rehman is a philanthropist. She is an advocate for education and is an ambassador for Rang De, an organisation combating poverty in India. Early Life & Background Waheeda Rehman was born on 3 February 1938 to a Dakhini Muslim family in Chengalpet of present-day Tamil Nadu, India. It is a common misconception that Rehman was born in Hyderabad instead of Tamil Nadu. Her father was Mohammed Abdur Rehman and her mother was Mumtaz Begum, and she was the youngest out of 4 daughters. As a child, she and her sisters were trained Bharatanatyam in Chennai.Guru Dutt was my mentor: Waheeda/ She studied in St. Joseph's Convent in Visakhapatnam when her father was posted there in the then-Madras Presidency. Her father, who worked as a district commissioner, died in 1951 while she was in her early teens.Gulzar, p. 22 Rehman's dream was to become a doctor, but due to her family's circumstances emotionally and financially, alongside her mother's illness, she abandoned her goal. In order to help her family, she accepted movie offers that stemmed from her dancing abilities. Rehman's first performance on stage as a dancer in earlier days was at Brahmapur's Ganjam Kala Parishad organised by her uncle Dr. Ferose Ali who was a famous doctor and social activist in Brahmapur. Acting career = Early Work As A Starlet (1955‚Äì1959) = Rehman began her career in films in the mid-1950s, usually dancing in item numbers. Her film debut occurred in the Telugu film in a dance number in Rojulu Maraayi (1955), in which she was encouraged by the producer of the film to join the cast, despite hesitance from her mother. It was a success, becoming a channel for more offers from filmmakers to Rehman. She was featured in Jayasimha (1955) alongside veteran actor N. T. Rama Rao, with dance numbers in Tamil remake of Rojulu Maraayi, Kaalam Maari Pochu (1956) and the first full-length colour Tamil film Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum (1956) starring M.G. Ramachandran. Rehman in Pyaasa (1957) In the success party of Rojolu Maraayi, Hindi filmmaker Guru Dutt noticed her and decided to have her act in Hindi films. In later interviews, Rehman describes how she considers Dutt as her mentor. Dutt brought her to Bombay (current-day Mumbai) and offered her a supporting role in his production C.I.D. (1956), directed by Raj Khosla. Because of the famous Hindi actresses of that era, such as Madhubala, Nargis and Meena Kumari, Rehman was pressurised into changing her name into \\"something sexy\\", but she was adamant on keeping her birth name, signifying her will to stay true to herself. The success of the film caused Dutt to give Rehman her first leading role, as a prostitute in Pyaasa (1957), which was also a commercial success and became one of the most acclaimed films of Bollywood. By the time the decade was over, she acted in a few more films with Dutt, including 12 O'Clock (1958) and Kaagaz Ke Phool (1959). In the midst of her rise in Hindi Cinema, her mother passed away. Rehman also established a working relationship with Dev Anand, and their pairing together became one of the most iconic of Hindi Cinema. They had a number of successful films to their credit which include C.I.D. (1956), Solva Saal (1958), Kala Bazar (1960),Baat Ek Raat Ki (1962), Guide (1965) and Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja (1961). Suresh Kohli of The Hindu writes on her performance in Solva Saal, \\"Though barely 20 then and only in her fourth Hindi release, Waheeda Rehman demonstrates her class: both in serious scenes demanding intensity and through sparkling, mischievous eye movements during lighter moments.\\" = Rise To Recognition (1960‚Äì1964) = Besides Kala Bazar, Rehman acted in 3 other films in 1960, which were Ek Phool Char Kaante, Girlfriend and Chaudhvin Ka Chand. The lattermost was another partnership between Rehman and Dutt, and was the fourth-highest grossing Hindi film of 1960. It was considered a \\"saving\\" point in Dutt's career, after their last collaboration, Kaagaz Ke Phool (1959) received an underwhelming response at the box office, which now is considered a classic. It also represented the strained relationship of the duo. Dutt's existing marriage and her film successes with other directors caused them to drift apart both personally and professionally, although they continued to work together into the 1960s. Their last film together was the drama Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam (1962), starring Dutt, Meena Kumari, Rehman and Rehman herself in a supporting role, and the movie was a huge success and was lauded by Indian and international critics. The film earned Rehman her first Filmfare nomination in the category of Best Supporting Actress, and the film itself received nominations for the Golden Bear at the 13th Berlin International Film Festival and was selected as India's official entry to the Oscars, in addition to a Filmfare Award for Best Film. Rehman and Dutt finally broke away in 1963, and a year later, Dutt was found dead on 10 October 1964 in Mumbai, reportedly from an overdose mixture of sleeping pills and alcohol. The actress began to experiment with her roles when she ventured into Bengali film-making with Satyajit Ray's film Abhijan (1962). As the years went on, she began to taste higher success when she was offered the leading actress roles in films and played parts that were deemed as unconventional for the typical Bollywood actress. Rehman played a murder suspect in Baat Ek Raat Ki (1962), a girl embroiled in a sibling feud in Rakhi (1962) and an infertile woman in Ek Dil Sau Afsane (1963). As a leading lady, she also started to star opposite of many familiar faces of Hindi Cinema; Sunil Dutt in Mujhe Jeene Do (1962), Nirupa Roy in Kaun Apna Kaun Paraya (1963) and Biswajit in the horror film Kohraa (1964), the drama film Majboor (1964), and the psychological-thriller Bees Saal Baad (1962)‚Äîthe latter becoming the highest-grossing Hindi film of 1962. At the end of 1964, Rehman became the third-highest paid actress in Bollywood, from 1959 to 1964. = Career Peak (1965‚Äì1971) = Vijay Anand's magnum opus, the 1965 romantic drama Guide presented Rehman with a different outlook of success that resulted in major fame and popularity to her name and turned one of the most iconic actresses of Hindi Cinema. The film itself was an adaptation of the same book written by R. K. Narayan, published in 1958. Rehman and Dev Anand played the lead roles in the film, after having last worked together in Baat Ek Raat Ki (1962), an average success at the box office. The film itself proved difficult for Rehman, as her character Rosie was rebellious, strong-willed and didn't fit the mould of the usual women Bollywood films portrayed. However, Guide was an instant success, becoming the fifth-highest grossing Hindi film of 1965 and a fan-favorite in Rehman's repertoire. Guide opened to high critical acclaim and Rehman's performance received particular praise, with Trisha Gupta of Hindustan Times writing, \\"Rosie was triply unusual: a woman who walks out of an unhappy marriage, begins a romantic relationship with a man who isn‚Äôt her husband, and simultaneously embarks on a successful career as a dancer. She would be an unusual Hindi film heroine even today.\\" and her performance was ranked amongst her and Bollywood's best. She won her first Filmfare Award‚ÄîFilmfare Award for Best Actress‚Äîand soon after, she became a sought-over actress in the latter half of the 1960s. Guide became India's official entry to the Oscars and won for National Film Award for Best Feature Film in the 13th National Film Awards and a staple film in Hindi cinema and is considered a Bollywood classic. Her peak continued when she was paired with other well-established superstars, namely Dilip Kumar, Rajendra Kumar, Raj Kapoor, and Rajesh Khanna. Among her most acclaimed films of late 1960s include Teesri Kasam (1966) which won National Film Award for Best Feature Film, Ram Aur Shyam (1967), Neel Kamal (1968) and Khamoshi (1969). The last three movies all earned Rehman consecutive nominations for Filmfare Award for Best Actress each, with her winning her second Filmfare Award in Neel Kamal. In her role in Khamoshi starring alongside Rajesh Khanna and Dharmendra, it is believed to be Rehman's finest acting performance. She plays a nurse who goes mentally insane after falling in love with one of her patients, and eventually is sent to her own mental institution. Other commercial successes of this period were Patthar Ke Sanam (1967) and Aadmi (1968), and box office failures include Palki (1967) , Dharti (1970) , Darpan (1970) and Shatranj (1969), though were critically praised. At the end of the 1960s, Rehman ranked a new record amongst herself in becoming the second-paid actress in Bollywood, from 1964-1969. She states herself, \\"For Solva Saal, my first film as a freelancer, I received ‚Çπ30,000. The highest I ever earned in my career was 7 lakh for a film.\\" = Character Roles, Career Decline and Marriage (1971) = Her career continued throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. She won the Filmfare Best Actress Award for her roles in Guide (1965) and Neel Kamal (1968) where she hit the peak of her career, but despite excellent offbeat roles in subsequent films, including a National Award-winning performance in Reshma Aur Shera (1971) and Zindagi Zindagi (1972), some of her films failed at the box office. Seeing her films being successful, Rehman decided to experiment with roles at this stage of career. She accepted Reshma Aur Shera in 1971 which received nominations for the Golden Bear at the 22nd Berlin International Film Festival and was selected as India's official entry to the Oscars, opposite her older co-star Sunil Dutt, with whom she had previously in hits such as Ek Phool Char Kaante (1960), Mujhe Jeene Do (1963), Meri Bhabhi and Darpan (1970). Her performance was appreciated by critics, but the film failed at the box office. But Rehman continued to experiment with roles and accepted the offer to play a mother to Jaya Bhaduri in Phagun (1973). This, she regards the mistake of her career, as after this film flopped, suddenly people started offering her motherly roles to heroes.Nanda, Waheeda Rehman, Helen and Sadhana Film expert Rajesh Subramanian reported that Manmohan Desai had approached Rehman, on behalf of Shammi Kapoor, during the making of Naseeb (1981). In the song \\"John Jani Janardhan\\", Shammi Kapoor and Waheeda Rehman make a grand-entry holding hands. Incidentally this was the first time the two stars appeared together on screen. Later she also worked on Desai's Coolie (1983) and Allah Rakha (1986). From the mid-'70s, Rehman's career as a lead heroine ended and her career as a character actor began. At around this time, Kamaljit, who starred opposite her in Shagoon (1964), proposed to her and they got married in 1974. After her appearance in Lamhe (1991), she retired from the film industry for 11 years. In her new innings from the '70s, her successful films where she played pivotal roles include Kabhi Kabhie (1976), Trishul (1978), Jwalamukhi (1980), Namkeen and Namak Halaal (1982), Mashaal (1984), Chandni (1989) and Lamhe (1991).Namkeen, Chandni and Lamhe garnered her nominations for Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress. She played the central character in the Mahesh Bhatt-directed film Swayam (1991) which also starred Anupam Kher and Akash Khurana. She also appeared in a tele-series being directed by Gulzar.Initially, Rehman was supposed to play the role of frequent co-star Amitabh Bachchan's mother in Karan Johar's Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001). However, after having shot a few scenes, she dropped out of the film due to her husband's death in November 2000. Subsequently her role then was then played by Achala Sachdev. In recent years, she made a comeback playing elderly mother and grandmother roles in Om Jai Jagadish (2002), Water (2005), 15, Park Avenue (2005), Rang De Basanti (2006) and Delhi 6 (2009) all of which received critical acclaim. In 2011 , she was honoured with the Padma Bhushan and in 2013 with the Cenetary Award for Indian Film Personality on the occasion of 100 years of Indian Cinema for her contribution to Indian Cinema.  Personal Life  316x316px A biography has been written and published in 2014 about Rehman, entitled Conversations With Waheeda Rehman, which consist of interviews collected by author and director Nasreen Munni Kabir. At the beginning of her career, Rehman is rumoured to have been involved with her frequent collaborator Guru Dutt. At the time, Dutt was married to singer Geeta Dutt and had children. One of their films, Kaagaz Ke Phool, which chronicles a film director falling in love with an actress, is thought to be inspired by their ill-fated affair. Eventually, the pair broke off due to personal and professional reasons in 1963. Dutt eventually died in 1964 due to mixing of alcohol and sleeping pills. Rehman is private about her life and seldom speaks about it, as said in an interview at the launch of Conversations With Waheeda Rehman: In April 1974, Rehman married Shashi Rekhi (also known by his screen name Kamaljeet), and both had worked together prior in the film Shagoon (1964). She has 2 children: Sohail Rekhi and Kashvi Rekhi, both of them are writers. After her marriage, she lived in a farmhouse in Bangalore but after the death of her husband on 21 November 2000, she moved back to her ocean-view bungalow in Bandra, Mumbai, where she currently resides. In October 2004, a Waheeda Rehman film-retrospective was held at the Seattle Art Museum and the University of Washington where Rehman participated in spirited-panel-and- audience discussions on her most memorable films; Pyaasa, Teesri Kasam and Guide.

Other factories, including Carlton, Shelley and Arcadian, also made souvenir ware but Goss is still the most collectable. Historical The Industrial Revolution and the coming of railways opened up travel to working people rather than just the wealthy and, in particular, it led to the growth of English seaside resorts like Blackpool and Southend-on-Sea. William Henry Goss (1833‚Äì1906), owner of the Falcon pottery in Stoke-on-Trent, and his sons, Adolphus and Victor, are often credited with the idea of making souvenir ware bearing crests and names of seaside resorts in the late 19th century. In fact, Lowestoft porcelain in particular, but also other factories, had been producing such pieces for a century of so, but not as their main type of product. Now, many British people are familiar with the white glazed porcelain souvenirs, typically in classical shapes of Roman and Greek antiquities. They also made tiny replicas of visitor attractions like a statue of Captain Cook with the name and crest of the Captain's home town of Whitby. Small busts of famous people like Queen Victoria or George V, were also made together with of ships and cars. Goss cottages are amongst the most collectible. By the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, Goss china was immensely popular and, it is said, at least 90% of homes had at least one piece of Goss crested China. The First World War caused a decline and in 1929 the Goss family sold their factory which continued to produce souvenir ware until the end of the 1930s. After the Second World War interest in Goss revived and has continued. Pieces 200px Genuine Goss usually has an inscription on the base describing the item and also a goshawk crest with the name W.H.Goss below it.

Ancient and early medieval temples feature smaller gopuram, while in later temples they are a prominent feature of Hindu temples of the Dravidian style; or in many cases the temple compound was expanded and new larger gopuram built along the new boundary. They are topped by the kalasam, a bulbous stone finial. They function as gateways through the walls that surround the temple complex. Another towering structure located towards the center of the temple is the Vimanam. Both of them are designed and constructed as per rules given in the texts of Vaastu shastra. The gopuram's origins can be traced back to early structures of the Pallava kings, and relate to the central shikhara towers of North India. Between the twelfth and sixteenth century, during the Pandya, Nayaka and Vijayanagara era when Hindu temples increasingly became a hub of the urban life, these gateways became a dominant feature of a temple's outer appearance, eventually overshadowing the inner sanctuary which became obscured from view by the gopuram's colossal size and courtyards. It also dominated the inner sanctum in amount of ornamentation. Often a shrine has more than one gopuram. Besides South India, even in North East India, there is an enchanting gopura in the Shree Angala Parameswari Shree Muneswarar Temple in Moreh, the Indo-Myanmar border town in Manipur, which was established in the year 1967, built by the Tamil people of the region. They also appear in architecture outside India, especially Khmer architecture, as at Angkor Wat. A large Dravidian-style temple, or koil, may have multiple gopurams as the openings into successively smaller walled enclosures around the main shrine, with the largest generally at the outer edges. The temple compound is typically square or rectangular with at least the outermost wall having gopuras, often from the four cardinal directions. The multiple storeys of a gopuram typically repeat the lower level features on a rhythmic diminishing scale. The inner sanctum and its towering roof (the central deity's shrine) is also called the Vimanam, although in the south it is typically smaller than the gopurams in large temples. Etymology The Tamil derivation is from the two words: ‡Æï‡Øã (k≈ç) and ‡Æ™‡ØÅ‡Æ±‡ÆÆ‡Øç (puram) meaning 'king' and 'exterior' respectively. It originates from the Sangam age when it was known as ‡Æì‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ ‡Æ®‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øà ‡Æµ‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç (≈çnggu nilai vƒÅyil) meaning 'imperishable gateway'. An alternative derivation is from the Sanskrit word gopuram, which can be broken down to go (), which means either 'a city' or 'a cow', and puram (), 'a town', or 'a settlement'. Dr. Sthapati explains the meaning of the words gopuram and vimanam thus. Vimanam means measure, indicating the number of measures made in the construction and design of that structure. Gopuram consist of two words, gawa and puram, meaning the place from which all the energy that exists in all living beings comes inside. Architecture Detail of a gopuram at Chennai A gopuram is usually a tapering oblong in form with ground-level wooden doors, often richly decorated, providing access. Above is the tapering or \\"battered\\" gopuram, divided into many storeys (talas), which diminish in size as the gopuram tower narrows. Usually the tower is topped with a barrel vaulted roof with a finial. The form began rather modestly in the 10th century, as at Shore Temple, Mamallapuram, with the 11th century Brihadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur marking a crucial step forward with two multi-storey gopurams from that period, much larger than any earlier ones, though much smaller than the main tower (vimanam) of the temple. The four gopurams of the Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram are important early examples, begun in the mid-13th century but completed over a longer period.Harle, 320-325 Gopurams are exquisitely decorated with sculpture and carvings and painted with a variety of themes derived from the Hindu mythology, particularly those associated with the presiding deity of the temple where the gopuram is located. The two tallest gopuras are both modern, at least in part. The Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam, Tamil Nadu, has 21 gopurams (tower gateways), including the towering Rajagopuram (shrine of the main gateway), which is claimed as the tallest temple tower in Asia. The -tall 13-tiered Rajagopuram was completed in 1987 (having previously been incomplete) and dominates the landscape for kilometers around, while the remaining 20 gopurams were built between the 14th and 17th centuries.\\"Towers\\" on temple website; Tamilwebworld Competing for the title of \\"tallest\\" is the twenty storey gopura at the modern Murdeshwar Temple, which, unusually, is provided with a lift.\\"Murudeshwar Temple Now Tallest Gopuram in Asia\\", April 2008 File:Sangameswarar Temple in Salem, Tamil Nadu, India.jpgSangameswarar Temple in Salem, Tamil Nadu, India File:Nataraja Temple gopuram artwork in Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu.jpgNataraja Temple gopuram artwork in Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu File:Thiruvannamalai Annamalaiyar Temple Gopurams.jpgThiruvannamalai Annamalaiyar Temple Gopurams File:View over Arunchaleshvara Temple from the Red Mountain - Tiruvannamalai - India 01.JPGAnnamalaiyar Temple, Thiruvannamalai Image:Murdeshwar temple gopuram.jpgMurdeshwar File:Srirangam Temple Gopuram (767010404).jpgRanganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam Image:Andal Temple.jpgSrivilliputhur File:Pariyur.jpgPariyur File:Vadakkumnathan Temple.jpgVadakkunnathan, Thrissur File:Thiruchendur_Temple_Rajagopuram.JPGTiruchendur File:West_Tower.jpgThillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram File:Ekambareshwarar5.jpgKancheepuram File:Karnataka Hampi IMG 0730.jpgHampi Image:Tirumala temple.JPGTirumala File:Sri_Mahamariamman_temple- Kuala_Lumpur_Malaysia.jpgKuala Lumpur Image:AnnavaramTemple.jpgAnnavaram File:Simhachalam Gopuram Night.jpgSimhachalam Image:Aathikoneswaram.jpgAthi Koneswaram Image:Gopuram Madurai.jpgMadurai Image:Nanjangud_Temple_at_Night.jpgNanjangud File:Subhramanya Swamy Temple in Biccavole.jpgBiccavolu File:Chebrolu Temple.jpgChebrolu File:Besakih02.jpgBesakih, Bali File:Sringeri Temple of Toronto.jpgToronto File:Iraivan dsc8361.jpgOn left is a gopuram, to the right above the sanctum is vimana See also * List of tallest Gopurams Notes References *Harle, J.C., The Art and Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent, 2nd edn. 1994, Yale University Press Pelican History of Art, External links Category:Hindu temple architecture Category:Types of gates ta:‡Æï‡Øã‡Æ™‡ØÅ‡Æ∞‡ÆÆ‡Øç Category:Hindu temples Category:Hindu architecture Category:India-related topics ","title":"Gopuram"},{"id":"2451379","text":"Good Clean Fun is a hardcore punk band from Washington, D.C. who took their band name from the Descendents song of the same name.

Other influences include 7 Seconds, Minor Threat, and Youth of Today. The band recorded three records before pretending to part ways in 2002, saying \\"their mission had been accomplished and they had reached their goals.\\" At the same time, also as predicted in their song \\"I Can't Wait\\", they released a compilation album from their entire career, Positively Positive 1997-2002, on Equal Vision. The band continued the running gag, doing a 'reunion' tour in 2004. GCF released a new record in January 2006 entitled Between Christian Rock And A Hard Place again on Equal Vision. In Europe their material is released by Reflections Records. The new album was supported by a full European and US tours. This included their third performance at Fluff Fest in the Czech Republic for which they received ‚Ç¨300. In December 2006 the band announced they would be releasing a rarities compilation entitled Crouching Tiger, Moshing Panda and would include compilation tracks, out of print 7\\"'s, and some songs that are not available on any albums.

Captain William Robinson was the first lighthouse keeper, working there for 47 years. He lived there with his wife and thirteen children. His residence was built out of limestone, the same material as that the forty foot octagonal tower connected to it was built out of. Towards the end of his life, Robinson walked with a cane. The lighthouse is said to be haunted, with people hearing the tapping of Robinson's cane. Frances Marshall, known as the last female lighthouse keeper in Michigan, worked there after his service. The lighthouse served as a guide to the river until 1960, when it was decommissioned. Fruitland Township acquired the lighthouse in 1966 and built a museum in 1970. Visitors can climb the spiral staircase or look at the original Fourth Order Fresnel lens. It is open to the public as a museum with regular hours posted from Memorial Weekend through August 31.

(October 2006) Bow Quarter is a gated community in Bow in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The building was originally the Bryant and May match factory, and was the site of the Match Girls' strike in the 1880s. The factory was redeveloped in the 1980s, in one of east London's first urban renewal projects. History From the mid-19th century to more than three-quarters of the way through the 20th century it was the location of the Bryant and May match factory. At the turn of the two centuries it was London's largest factory. The 3 acre (1.2 hectare) site, acquired by William Bryant and Francis May in 1861, contained a number of factories that had once been used for the manufacture of candles, crinoline and rope, but had fallen into disrepair. Assistance in adapting the site for match making was provided by John Edvard Lundstr√∂m, the Swedish safety match maker. The London matchgirls strike of 1888 started in the factory, caused by the poor working conditions; including fourteen-hour work days, poor pay, excessive fines and the severe health complications of working with white phosphorus, such as phossy jaw. This led to the establishment of the first British trade union for women.Beaver (1985). Part One: Building a Business. A blue plaque outside the entrance commemorates the role of social pioneer and feminist Annie Besant in leading the demands for better pay and conditions. The result was that some of the first welfare institutions in Britain for industrial workers began on this site, including the provision of a dentist. The present main factory building was constructed in 1909‚Äì10.British Listed Buildings: Bryant and May Factory, Main Building, Bow At full production in 1911, the Bow site employed more than 2,000 women and girls.Beaver (1985). Part Two: Years of Growth. It finally closed in 1979, when 275 people worked there, production being transferred to Litherland near Liverpool.Beaver (1985). Part Three: The Age of Technology. Designed by Holman and Goodsham, it is concrete-framed red brick building, with two tall towers of ten stories. It is a Grade II Listed building.British Listed Buildings Present day The site had fallen into disrepair when in 1988, developers Kentish Homes, with designs from ORMS Architects (chief project architect Oliver Richards) - embarked upon one of east London's first urban renewal projects. In a history of the development in his 2009 book A Journey Through Ruins - The Last Days of London, historian Patrick Wright describes the process of gentrification of the area. As he puts it: \\"The coinage dreamed up to turn the Bryant & May factory into the Bow Quarter gave an altogether new turn to the rhetoric of an east London trade that local Member of Parliament (MP) George Lansbury once dismissed as 'room farming'. As the sales line of the developers went: 'Parisians have the Latin Quarter, New Yorkers have Greenwich Village. Now in East London, a stone's throw from the City, there's a new Quarter...\\"Wright (1991/2009). Chapter 16, \\"The Bow Quarter: Six Hundred and Seventy Luxury Flats in an Old Victorian Hell-House\\", pp. 234-264. However, unlike the former two, the latter would be \\"generated by a single speculative stroke\\". Today Bow Quarter consists of 733 one- and two-bedroom flats and penthouses, together with a handful of workers' cottages built around the late 19th century. Set in of landscaped grounds, amenities include a residents' gym, a bar and restaurant and a convenience store. The majority of the flats today are located in former factory and office buildings. Arlington, for example, was built as offices in 1874; Lexington and Manhattan date from the factory site redevelopment in 1911. The Victorian cottages near the entrance provided accommodation for the company directors whilst Staten was built as extra office accommodation in the late 1950s. The Park buildings (East, Central and West) were added in the mid-1990s. In 2004, the TV series If... shot scenes in the fictional gated community Regent's Court inside Bow Quarter. Some residents were interviewed by the production team during the making of the programme. Current residents include Katy B and Sunday Girl. Previous residents have included John Barrowman and Steve Strange. Former resident Danny Wallace declared his flat a micronation in the TV series How to Start Your Own Country. AudiopleXus mastering studio is located in the Bow Quarter. In April 2012, the Ministry of Defence identified the water tower as a potential location for surface-to-air missile defences during the 2012 Summer Olympics. One resident, a Guardian journalist, reported his own negative views as the feelings of the community, but in reality most were supportive of the move.

It is a lute with a round, hollow wooden body which gives it the nickname moon guitar. It has a short fretted neck and four strings tuned in courses of two (each pair of strings is tuned to a single pitch), generally tuned to the interval of a perfect fifth. Occasionally, the body of the yueqin may be octagonal in shape.http://www.yuemi.net/images3/MZ_boxian/yueqin(yizu).jpg It is an important instrument in the Peking opera orchestra, often taking the role of main melodic instrument in lieu of the bowed string section. The frets on all Chinese lutes are high so that the fingers never touch the actual body‚Äîdistinctively different from western fretted instruments. This allows for a greater control over timbre and intonation than their western counterparts, but makes chordal playing more difficult. According to tradition, the instrument was invented in China during the 3rd- to 5th-century Jin Dynasty. The ruan, another Chinese instrument, is the ancestor of the yueqin. The name yueqin once applied to all instruments with a moon-shaped soundboard, including the ruan; however, \\"yueqin\\" now applies to a separate category from the ruan family. Differences between yueqin and ruan Southern style long- necked yueqin. While both instruments have a moon-shaped soundboard, the modern ruan uses a bridge, whereas the yueqin simply attaches the strings the frame, similar to the design of the pipa. In addition, most yueqin do not have the obvious double soundholes, like the ruan, instead they have the single small soundhole located under where the strings are attached (also similar to pipa). Both features gives the Yueqin a sound quality in between ruan and pipa. While the ruan is used mostly for its lower range instruments (i.e., zhongruan and daruan), yueqin is primarily a treble tuned instrument, even though the size of its soundboard is larger than the zhongruan. Southern yueqin have a long neck, use two strings, and have an improvisational and flexible intonation practice; some Southern yueqin also have acoustical metal coils inside the soundboard to amplify the instrument. Northern yueqin have very short neck, and have bamboo in both the front and back, requiring the performer to hold the instrument away from their body. The northern instruments range from single to four stringed instruments. Regardless of the neck size or strings, all yueqin are tuned around the same treble pitch level. A common technique in performance is \\"snapping\\" the pick on the string (similar to Japanese shamisen.) Yueqin is the loudest member of the plucked lute family of Chinese instruments; one instrument can easily be heard over a full Chinese orchestra. Traditional yueqin Yueqin in the Horniman museum, London, UK. Front and back views of Yueqin. The yueqin in China has four strings, tuned in two \\"courses\\", D and A (low to high). Yueqin used for Beijing opera, however, have two single strings, only one of which is actually used, the lower string being there purely for sympathetic resonance. In Beijing opera, the player uses a small wood dowel instead of a plectrum to perform, and only plays in first position; this requires the performer to use octave displacement in order to play all the pitches within a given melody.https://instrumap.netlify.com/asia.html Instrumap collection of stringed instruments: Asia The frets were formerly arranged rather like those on a mountain dulcimer, so that the instrument is diatonic; however, the fret size is high enough that any pitch may be bent up a minor 3rd. Modern yueqin have frets tuned in semitones. The strings on the traditional form of the instrument were made of silk (although nylon is generally used today) and plucked with a rather long, sharp plectrum, which is sometimes attached to the instrument with a piece of cord. There is no sound-hole, but inside the sound box are one or more strands of wire attached only at one end, so that they vibrate, giving the instrument a particular timbre and resonance. There is no bridge or saddle; the strings are simply attached to the anchor at the base of the instrument. The instrument's standard Chinese name, yueqin, literally means \\"moon string instrument\\" (q√≠n - Áê¥ is the generic term for \\"string instrument\\" and yu√® means \\"moon\\"). Its alternate name, yueqin (ÊúàÁê¥), also means \\"moon string instrument\\". Modern yueqin Modern forms of the instrument have three or four strings made of steel (or steel-wrapped nylon), each tuned to a different pitch. The strings are attached to the anchor by looping them through their own end-loops. :three-string instruments are often tuned A D :four-string instruments are often tuned to A D a d; however, in recent practice, the instrument is tuned G D g d so modern liuqin and ruan players can easily double on yueqin. The anchor on modern instrument may have up to five holes, so it can be strung and tuned as a three- or four-string instrument. The nut, at the peghead end of the instrument, is filed with notches appropriate to the number and position of the strings. Modern yueqin are often played with a guitar pick. Taiwanese yueqin In Taiwan, the yueqin has a longer neck, and has two or three strings.https://atlasofpluckedinstruments.com/far_east.htm#chinahttps://stringedinstrumentdatabase.aornis.com/w.htm See also *ƒê√†n nguy·ªát *Music of China *Music of Taiwan References External links * Yueqin page * Yueqin photos (second and third rows) *(Japanese yueqin page) kokone.to *Page of a Japanese builder and repairer of yueqins =Video= *Yueqin video: Qing Shen Yi Chang (ÊÉÖÊ∑±Ë∞äÈïø), performed by Fang Jinlong from The Musical Instruments E-book Category:Chinese musical instruments Category:Necked lutes Category:Peking opera ","title":"Yueqin"},{"id":"2451418","text":"Pembroke Lodge is a Grade II listed Georgian mansion in Richmond Park in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It is located on high ground with views across the Thames valley to Windsor and Surrey. It has of beautifully landscaped grounds, including King Henry's Mound from which there is a protected view of St Paul's Cathedral in the City of London. The grounds also include memorials to the 18th-century poet James Thomson and the 20th-century rock-and-roll singer and lyricist Ian Dury. The building is of historical interest, having been the residence of the British prime minister Lord John (later, Earl) Russell and the childhood home of his grandson, the philosopher Bertrand Russell. GHQ Liaison Regiment (\\"Phantom\\") was also based there during the Second World War. Pembroke Lodge is part of the Crown Estate and is currently privately run as a catering facility and a conference and wedding venue on a long lease from The Royal Parks. It also houses a heritage charity, The Hearsum Collection. History Lord John Russell Pembroke Lodge in the 1880s The Lodge is first mentioned in 1754, when it was a one-roomed cottage occupied by a molecatcher. He was employed to eradicate molehills that were impeding the sport of deer hunting. The cottage was enlarged to become a house with four principal rooms and was renamed Hill Lodge. The Lodge was granted to Elizabeth Herbert, Countess of Pembroke and Montgomery, a \\"close friend\\" of King George III, at her request in 1787. Between 1788 and 1796 she extended the building, to a design by Sir John Soane, to form the entire Georgian wing and part of the north wing. She died, aged 93, at Pembroke Lodge in 1831.Malden, H E (ed.) (1911). \\"Parishes: Richmond (anciently Sheen)\\" in A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 3, British History Online, pp. 533‚Äì546. Accessed 14 August 2015. After the Countess of Pembroke's death the Lodge was occupied by William Hay, 18th Earl of Erroll. In 1847, Queen Victoria granted the Lodge to Lord John Russell, then Prime Minister, who conducted much government business there and entertained Queen Victoria, foreign royalty, aristocrats, writers (Dickens, Thackeray, Longfellow, Tennyson) and other notable people of the time, including Garibaldi. Lord John was much taken with the Lodge ‚Äì \\"an asset that could hardly be equalled, certainly not surpassed in England\\". Earl Russell (as he had become) died there on 28 May 1878; Fanny, his second wife, in 1898. Their daughter Lady Agatha Russell left a memorial, still standing in the rose garden: \\"Pembroke Lodge 1847‚Äì1902 ‚Äî In loving memory of my Father and Mother, Lord and Lady Russell and of our supremely happy home at Pembroke Lodge\\". Lord John Russell's grandson, Bertrand Russell, the philosopher and mathematician, grew up there between 1876 and 1894. At Pembroke Lodge, he wrote, \\"I grew accustomed to wide horizons and to an unimpeded view of the sunset\\". From 1903, until her death there in February 1929, Pembroke Lodge was tenanted by Georgina, Dowager Countess of Dudley, a close friend of Queen Alexandra. There is a headstone in Pembroke Lodge's gardens to the grave of her dog, Boy, who died in 1907. From 1929 to 1938, John Scott Oliver, a wealthy industrialist, lived at Pembroke Lodge. During World War II, the GHQ Liaison Regiment (also known as Phantom) established its regimental headquarters nearby at The Richmond Hill Hotel, with its base (including the officers' mess and billet) at Pembroke Lodge. Some of the members of the squad went on to become privy councillors, law lords, judges, MPs, a commissioner of the Metropolitan Police (Sir Robert Mark) and actors ‚Äì including David Niven, who remarked in a letter, \\"these were wonderful days which I would not have missed for anything\\". After World War II, Pembroke Lodge became a government-run tea room. Current use Now in private hands and restored to its former architectural glory, Pembroke Lodge is open to the public for refreshments, weddings and conferences. Pembroke Lodge is also the home of The Hearsum Collection, a registered charity Charity registration number 1153010 that collects and preserves the heritage of Richmond Park and is seeking to build a new purpose-built heritage centre to provide full public access to its holdings.

Its purpose is to improve organisations and working life through the promotion and facilitation of strong industrial relations practice. It may do this through a number of media such as arbitration or mediation, although the service is perhaps best known for its collective conciliation function ‚Äì that is resolving disputes between groups of employees or workers, often represented by a trade union, and their employers. Acas is an independent and impartial organisation that does not side with a particular party, but rather will help the parties to reach suitable resolutions in a dispute. Today, the employment world has mostly moved away from large-scale industrial disputes that characterised the late 1970s to the mid-1980s, when Acas became a household name. Accordingly, Acas' emphasis has shifted towards helping businesses to prevent problems before they arise, by means of, for example, its telephone helpline and training sessions. Furthermore, much of Acas conciliation work is now focused on individual complaints to an employment tribunal (i.e. where individuals claim their employer has denied them a legal right). History The service's roots lie in 1896 when the government launched a voluntary conciliation and arbitration service, which also gave free advice to employers and unions on industrial relations and personnel problems. There was a name change in 1960, to Industrial Relations Services, and again in 1972 to Conciliation and Advisory Service. Up to this point in its history the service remained firmly under the Government's wing. In 1974, the service was renamed the Conciliation and Arbitration Service and separated from government control, with an independent Council to direct it. 'Advisory' was added to its name in 1975 to reflect its full range of services, then finally in 1976 Acas was made a statutory body by the Employment Protection Act 1975. In 2010, there was speculation that the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government's plans to reduce the number of Quangos might threaten Acas, but the organisation survived the cuts. The Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill, laid in Parliament in May 2012, contained a number of proposed employment law changes, including the introduction from April 2014 of a new 'Early Conciliation' service under which all claims relating to alleged infringements of individual employment rights will come to Acas in the first instance, rather than the Tribunals Service. Acas will then have a short window of opportunity (up to a month) to try to help to resolve the issue before the needs to apply to a Tribunal. Structure Although largely funded by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Acas is a non- departmental body, governed by an independent Council which is responsible for determining Acas' strategic direction, policies and priorities, and ensuring its statutory duties are carried out effectively. This allows the service to be independent, impartial and confidential. The Council consists of the Chair and eleven employer, trade union and independent members, appointed by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Acas' current Chair is Sir Brendan Barber, former General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress. Sir Brendan replaced the former Amicus Deputy General Secretary Ed Sweeney as Chair in 2014. Acas' day-to-day operations are managed by its Chief Executive and a management board that includes its national and regional directors. Acas' current Chief Executive, Susan Clews, was appointed in November 2018, replacing Anne Sharp, who had been in post since 2013. Acas has around 800 staff, based in its London head office and 11 main regional centres across England, Scotland and Wales. Acas' chief conciliator is David Prince.

History  Hart Massey's mausoleum in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto = Canada = The Massey family of Canada was known for manufacturing farm equipment and for being patrons of the arts in Canada. In 1847, Daniel Massey established the Newcastle Foundry and Machine Manufactory in what is now Newcastle, Ontario. The enterprise was subsequently renamed as the Massey Manufacturing Co. and, in 1879, moved to Toronto, Ontario. In 1891, the Massey Manufacturing Co. merged with A. Harris, Son and Company to form Massey-Harris Limited, which became the largest agricultural equipment maker in the British Empire. Massey-Harris Limited eventually became Massey-Harris-Ferguson as a result of a 1953 merger between Massey-Harris Limited and a British agricultural machinery firm, the Ferguson Company. The company's name was shortened to Massey Ferguson in 1958, which it maintains to this day. In 1894, Hart Massey built Massey Hall, a concert hall in Toronto, in memory of his late son, Charles Albert Massey (1848‚Äì1884), who loved music. Construction was financed by Hart Massey. In 1975, Massey Hall was municipally designated as a historic site under the Ontario Heritage Act. On 15 June 1981, Massey Hall was designated a National Historic Site of Canada. Starting in July 2018, Massey Hall underwent a two-year restoration project to restore and renew both the interior and exterior of the building, improve patron amenities and accessibility, open two new music venues, and enable the return of the building's original stained glass windows from 1894. In 1918, the Massey family incorporated the Massey Foundation, which was responsible for the construction of many Toronto landmarks and was the first trust of its kind in Canada. In 1919, Vincent Massey, who would be sworn in as Governor General of Canada in 1952, initiated and financed the Hart House, a student activity centre at the University of Toronto and one of the earliest North American student centres. Vincent Massey, who was an alumnus and benefactor of the university, named the Hart House student centre in honour of his grandfather, Hart Massey. In 1962, the Massey Foundation established, built and partially endowed Massey College, a graduate residential college at the University of Toronto. = United States = The Massey family of Virginia included Parson John Edward Massey, who was the second Lieutenant Governor of Virginia following the American Civil War. At one point, he co-owned Ash Lawn, the former home of President James Monroe, which was located beside President Thomas Jefferson's Monticello plantation in Charlottesville, Virginia. The Massey family of North Carolina descended from Thomas Massey, who migrated from Cheshire, England, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1683 on a sloop named Endeavor. The Massy and Massey families of the midwest descend from Nicholas Massey (1630‚Äì1688), who migrated to Dorchester, Maryland, from the Isle of Ely in England.

Forrester is a tall, agile, talented number eight with excellent ball handling skills and an eye for the try line, as his impressive try tally for Gloucester Rugby demonstrates. Born in Oxford, he learnt his rugby at school and as a mini/junior with Bicester Rugby Club. During his time at St Edward's School, Oxford, he also developed his game and although disappointed at missing out on an England U18 Group Schools cap in 1999, he had more than made up for it by the end of that year when he signed for Gloucester Rugby. Whilst at Gloucester he started in the 2002 Zurich Championship Final (the year before winning the play-offs constituted winning the English title) in which Gloucester defeated Bristol Rugby, and the 2003 Powergen Cup Final in which he scored a try when Gloucester defeated Northampton Saints. In 2003 Forrester was named PRA Premiership Young Player Of The Year as well as Sports Writers Young Player of the year. He was also named in the 37 man training squad for the 2003 World cup before a wrist injury and surgery ruled him unavailable. Having played for England U21 he made his England A debut against Wales in Bristol during 2002 and in June of that year also played for an England XV against the Barbarians at Twickenham, scoring a memorable 65-metre try and outstripping Jonah Lomu in the process. He was also capped by the England Sevens squad in 2002, playing in the opening World Series tournament in Dubai and two others and was man of the match with two tries, when England A thrashed Scotland 78‚Äì6 in March 2003. He was considered an outside chance for Clive Woodward's 2003 Rugby World Cup squad but was ultimately left out. Unfortunately, injury has affected his career and he required an elbow operation in 2002‚Äì03 and then dislocated his shoulder in 2003‚Äì04 in the England A match against France A. In the summer of 2004 he signed a three-year contract to stay at Kingsholm. In 2005 he sneaked his first England cap, against Wales in the RBS 6 Nations, coming on as a blood replacement for Joe Worsley. His second cap came as a replacement in November 2005 against Samoa. Forrester has shown his versatility, in that he has played in all three back-row positions plus centre, including in Gloucester Rugby‚Äôs 16‚Äì24 defeat in the Zurich Premiership wildcard final against Saracens on 14 May 2005. The week previously he scored 2 tries from centre against Newcastle. On Sunday 21 May 2006 Forrester clinched the European Challenge Cup for Gloucester Rugby with a superb try in extra time at The Stoop. Forrester made an impressive start to the following season scoring 3 tries in 3 games, one of which was against Harlequins at The Stoop again. After a horrific injury towards the end of this season at Ashton Gate Stadium he missed the entire 2007/08 season. On 10 October 2008, it was announced on the Gloucester rugby website that he was to retire with immediate effect as a consequence of this injury. In late 2008 Gloucester awarded Forrester a Testimonial dinner. In 2009, Forrester relocated to Singapore with his family where he coached Singapore Premiership team Wanderers to victory, 4 years in a row 2013-2016. Additionally he took up the role of Head Coach for the Singapore Rugby Union Men's 15's & 7's. In 2013 led Singapore to promotion from division two with a win against a very strong Malaysian side in the final. In 2014 led Singapore to victory over UAE a team who had finished 2nd in Asia 2 years before. This win guaranteed our place in Div 1 for next year. Unfortunately Singapore had no opportunity to gain promotion as IRB changed the league structure the following year. In 2011, Forrester launched his own fitness business, UFIT. Initially starting with boot camps, personal training and nutrition consultancy. Later, he opened two Crossfit boxes in Singapore, Crossfit Bukit Timah and Crossfit Tanjong Pagar. In 2015, UFIT Bootcamps merged with its largest bootcamp rival in Singapore, OZFIT, culminating in UFITs SHEFIT brand. Later that year UFIT opened its 4th facility UFIT One north. In 2016, UFIT Clinic was born, offering physiotherapy, rehabilitation and sports psychology to clients in Singapore. The most recent addition to UFIT's offerings is UFIT Education & UFIT Academy. UFIT Education trains and develops fitness professionals and offers schools and businesses the opportunity to upskill. UFIT Academy works with young athletes and sports teams. In 2017 UFIT opened their 3rd Personal training studio in the heart of the city on the famous Orchard Rd, a state of the art 3500 sq ft facility servicing clients around the Orchard area. UFIT also opened a gym within the LinkedIn offices and a 2nd physio therapy clinic at the One North business park. UFIT Clinic In 2018 UFIT opened their 3rd physio Clinic also in the popular Orchard road location, the space doubles up as a Pilates studio as well. UFIT also opened a personal training gym within the Australian International school, their 10th location on the island. In May 2018 Forrester won The Fider Singapore entrepreneur of the year award. http://www.thefinder.com.sg/healthy-living/expatpreneur-awards-2018-business- of-the-year-james-forrester-ufit-singapore/ References External links * Gloucester Rugby Profile * England profile * Retirement announcement * * Category:England international rugby union players Category:English rugby union players Category:Gloucester Rugby players Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:People educated at St Edward's School, Oxford Category:Rugby union number eights Category:Sportspeople from Gloucestershire ","title":"James Forrester (rugby union)"},{"id":"2451445","text":"Daniel Menche (born December 4, 1969) is an American experimental musician and multidisciplinary artist from Portland, Oregon.

The phrase is often loosely translated into English as \\"By the sword we seek peace, but peace only under liberty.\\" The literal translation, however, is \\"she seeks with the sword a quiet peace under liberty.\\" The \\"she\\" in question refers to the word manus from the full phrase manus haec inimica tyrannis ense petit placidam sub libertate quietem, which means \\"this hand, an enemy to tyrants, seeks with the sword a quiet peace under liberty.\\" It was written c. 1660 by English soldier- statesman Algernon Sidney, who was an opponent of Charles II and who was later executed for treason. The motto was first adopted in 1775 by the Massachusetts General Court (the official name of the state legislature) and applied to the temporary seal of Massachusetts. On December 13, 1780, the legislature approved its application to the current Great Seal of Massachusetts.

He was the eldest son of Zhuge Jin, a military general who served under Wu's founding emperor, Sun Quan. After Sun Quan's death in 252, Zhuge Ke served as regent for Sun Quan's son and successor, Sun Liang, but the regency proved to be militarily disastrous due to Zhuge Ke's aggressive foreign policy towards Wu's rival state, Cao Wei. In 253, he was ousted from power in a coup d'√©tat and killed along with his family. Early life and career In 221, when the Wu emperor Sun Quan designated his son Sun Deng as crown prince, he set up a staff for the crown prince composed of the sons of key officials in his government or other well-known younger members of the administration. The four most prominent ones were Zhuge Ke (Zhuge Jin's son), Zhang Xiu (Zhang Zhao's son), Gu Tan (Gu Yong's grandson) and Chen Biao (Chen Wu's son). Sun Deng treated the four of them as his close friends and they served as his advisers. When he ordered his secretary Hu Zong () to write a commentary on his advisers in 229, Hu Zong wrote that Zhuge Ke was the most skilful and intelligent of his generation. While this might have been true, Zhuge Ke was also known for being reckless ‚Äì a negative trait that his father Zhuge Jin repeatedly chided him for. On one occasion, Zhuge Jin observed, \\"This child will either bring great honour to my household or destroy it.\\" Pacifying the Shanyue Around 234, Zhuge Ke submitted a plan to Sun Quan to suppress the indigenous Shanyue tribes and recruit about 40,000 locals to serve as soldiers in Danyang Commandery (‰∏πÈôΩÈÉ°; around present-day Xuancheng, Anhui). Most of Sun Quan's senior officials, including Zhuge Ke's father Zhuge Jin, considered the plan reckless and costly. However, after Zhuge Ke insisted that his plan would be successful, Sun Quan appointed him as the Administrator () of Danyang Commandery and General Who Pacifies the Yue (), effectively giving him full authority to implement his plan.Zizhi Tongjian vol. 72. Once Zhuge Ke arrived in Danyang Commandery, he requested the Administrators of the four neighbouring commanderies to seal their borders and refrain from using military force against the Shanyue. When it was the harvesting season, he gave orders to quickly harvest the grain and stockpile them far away from the Shanyue. The Shanyue, deprived of food supplies, had no choice but to surrender to Zhuge Ke, who treated them kindly and earned their respect. By 237, Danyang Commandery was completely under the Wu government's control and had become a highly productive commandery for manpower and supplies. Zhuge Ke was also able to easily fulfil his quota of conscripting 40,000 local men to serve as soldiers. Sun Quan was so impressed with Zhuge Ke that he promoted him to General Who Awes the North () and awarded him the title of a Marquis of a Chief District ().Zizhi Tongjian vol. 73. Planned attack on Shouchun In 243, Zhuge Ke planned to launch a major attack on Shouchun (Â£ΩÊò•; around present-day Shou County, Anhui), a strategic location in Eastern Wu's rival state, Cao Wei. After he positioned his forces in preparation for the attack, the Wei general Sima Yi showed up with his troops to defend Shouchun and counterattack Zhuge Ke. Instead of allowing Zhuge Ke to engage Sima Yi, Sun Quan ordered him to retreat back to Wu. Despite his withdrawal, Zhuge Ke became famous among the Wu people for willing to stand up to Sima Yi, who had a huge reputation in Wei. The Wu general Lu Xun was concerned about Zhuge Ke's recklessness so he wrote a letter to him, urging him to be more cautious in the future. Zhuge Ke decided to defer to Lu Xun, who was much more senior than him, so he wrote back and apologised for his attitude. After Lu Xun's death in 245, Sun Quan appointed Zhuge Ke as General-in-Chief () and ordered him to assume Lu Xun's role at Wuchang (Ê≠¶Êòå; present-day Ezhou, Hubei) to supervise military affairs in Jing Province. Appointment as regent In 251, when Sun Quan became critically ill, he sought a regent for his young son and heir apparent, Sun Liang. One of his close aides, Sun Jun, recommended Zhuge Ke. Although Sun Quan had second thoughts about Zhuge Ke, particularly his arrogance, he eventually heeded Sun Jun's advice and recalled Zhuge Ke back from Wuchang to the Wu imperial capital, Jianye. Before Zhuge Ke left Wuchang, the senior Wu general L√º Dai told him, \\"What you will be doing is a difficult task. Before you do anything, you should reconsider ten times.\\" Zhuge Ke responded in a disrespectful manner: \\"When Ji Wenzi (Â≠£ÊñáÂ≠ê) reconsidered thrice before acting, Confucius told him, 'Only reconsider twice.' You, Sir, are telling me to reconsider ten times. Are you not saying that I am stupid?\\" L√º Dai did not respond. Historians interpreted this incident as a sign of Zhuge Ke's growing arrogance and recklessness. Indeed, Zhuge Ke became more arrogant after his appointment as regent, and especially after a dying Sun Quan instructed his subjects to let Zhuge Ke review all important policy decisions first. As regent to Sun Liang Sun Quan died in 252 and was succeeded by Sun Liang, who became the second emperor of Eastern Wu. After his coronation, Sun Liang appointed Zhuge Ke as Grand Tutor (). During his short tenure as regent, Zhuge Ke relaxed some of the strict laws enacted in Sun Quan's reign and reduced tax rates. The people of Wu were very pleased with him; wherever he went, there were massive crowds jostling to get a better view of him. =Battle of Dongxing= In late 252, Zhuge Ke gave orders to rebuild the dam at Dongxing (Êù±Ëàà; in present-day Chaohu, Anhui), which was constructed earlier in 230 but had been destroyed in 241. His plan was to create a reservoir near the Chao Lake and use it as a defensive structure against potential invasions from Wei, as well as to construct two castles nearby to serve as forward attack mechanisms for Wu ships. In response, the Wei regent Sima Shi sent three separate forces to attack Wu, with the main one focusing on the Dongxing dam. Zhuge Ke, along with the veteran Wu general Ding Feng and others, caught the enemy off guard by pretending to lower their guard, and inflicted a devastating defeat on them and forced them to withdraw from Dongxing. =Battle of Hefei= In 253, Zhuge Ke prepared for another invasion of Wei and said that he wanted to take advantage of Sima Shi's \\"youth and inexperience\\" (even though Sima Shi was 45 years old then). Despite strong opposition from some Wu officials, Zhuge Ke rallied an army from among all able-bodied men in Wu for the invasion. He also coordinated the invasion with Jiang Wei, a general from Wu's ally state Shu Han. (At the time, Jiang Wei was also actively launching a series of campaigns against Wei at Wei's western border.) However, Zhuge Ke's strategy turned out to be flawed when he switched his target from Shouchun (Â£ΩÊò•; around present-day Shou County, Anhui) to Hefei, even though Hefei's defences were much stronger and built to withstand enemy attacks. After a long siege, the Wu forces failed to breach Hefei's walls. When a plague broke out in the Wu army, Zhuge Ke ignored it and continued to press on the siege. He only withdrew after hearing that Wei reinforcements had arrived. Instead of returning to the Wu imperial capital Jianye to apologise for his mistakes, he stayed away from Jianye for some time and refused to take responsibility for the Wu defeat. Downfall, death and posthumous rehabilitation When Zhuge Ke returned to Jianye later in 253, he attempted to wipe out all dissent against him by punishing those who disagreed with him. He also made plans for another invasion of Wei, despite much resentment from the people over the heavy losses incurred from the previous campaign. Sun Jun, a Wu general distantly related to the Wu emperor Sun Liang, decided to launch a coup d'√©tat against Zhuge Ke to oust him from power. He lied to Sun Liang that Zhuge Ke was secretly plotting to usurp the throne and then set up a trap for Zhuge Ke. (The extent of Sun Liang's involvement in the coup d'√©tat is unclear. However, historians traditionally consider him to have understood and approved Sun Jun's actions even though he was only about 10 years old then.) Zhuge Ke met his end at the hands of Sun Jun's assassins when he unsuspectingly attended a banquet hosted by Sun Liang in the imperial palace. After Zhuge Ke's death, Sun Jun used the opportunity to send his troops to capture and execute Zhuge Ke's family members. Sun Jun became the new Wu regent after Zhuge Ke's death and he monopolised state power until his death in 256, after which his cousin Sun Chen succeeded him and continued to rule as regent. In 258, Sun Chen deposed Sun Liang and replaced him with his brother Sun Xiu as the new Wu emperor. Sun Xiu staged a coup against Sun Chen shortly after his accession to the throne and succeeded in eliminating him. Sun Xiu posthumously rehabilitated Zhuge Ke and ordered him to be reburied with full honours. However, he refused to have a monument built to commemorate Zhuge Ke when someone suggested doing so, because he felt that Zhuge Ke's recklessness and the losses he caused to Wu made him unworthy of such commemoration. Anecdotes and legends An anecdote goes that sometime in Zhuge Ke's childhood or adolescence, he attended a banquet hosted by the Wu emperor Sun Quan. Among the Wu officials, there was a joke that Zhuge Jin (Zhuge Ke's father) had a very long face. Sun Quan played along by ordering a donkey to be brought to the banquet, bearing a sign which said \\"Zhuge Ziyu\\". (\\"Ziyu\\" was Zhuge Jin's courtesy name.) He then turned to Zhuge Ke and asked him to add any two characters to the sign. Zhuge Ke added zhi l√º (‰πãÈ©¢; \\"the donkey of\\") and requested the donkey as a gift for his father. Sun Quan was impressed with the young Zhuge Ke's wit. In another anecdote, also in a banquet setting, Sun Quan once asked Zhuge Ke whether he thought that his father Zhuge Jin was better compared to his uncle Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor of Wu's ally state Shu Han. When Zhuge Ke said his father was better, Sun Quan asked him why and he replied, \\"My father chose the right Emperor to serve while my uncle didn't. Therefore, my father is better than my uncle.\\" Impressed by the subtle flattery, Sun Quan instructed Zhuge Ke to serve wine to the other guests present at the banquet. (It was an honour for junior officials to serve wine to senior officials at the time.) When Zhuge Ke came to Zhang Zhao, the latter refused to drink and said, \\"This isn't the proper form for a ceremony to pay respect to an elder.\\" After learning of Zhang Zhao's refusal, Sun Quan told Zhuge Ke, \\"Get Zhang Zhao to drink for me.\\" Zhuge Ke then returned to Zhang Zhao and said, \\"Long ago, the great strategist Jiang Ziya, at the age of 90, went to battle holding a signal flag and carrying a battleaxe; he never considered himself old. In days of trial by arms, you are always in the rear; in days of feasting, you are always in the front. What do you mean when you say this is not a proper ceremony to pay respect to an elder?\\" At a loss for words, Zhang Zhao consented and accepted the wine offered by Zhuge Ke. After this incident, Sun Quan regarded Zhuge Ke even more highly and consequently appointed him as a close aide to his then-heir apparent, Sun Deng. On another occasion, an ambassador from Wu's ally state, Shu, showed up with a gift of horses for Sun Quan. Knowing that Zhuge Ke was a good rider, Sun Quan summoned him with the intention of giving him one of the horses. When Zhuge Ke arrived, he immediately knelt down and thanked Sun Quan for the gift. Sun Quan was surprised at how Zhuge Ke already knew why he was summoned there, so he asked him. Zhuge Ke replied, \\"Shu is only capable of serving as Your Majesty's stable. That is why I am certain that the ambassador came here to offer a tribute of fine steeds.\\" Sun Quan was impressed. Physical Appearance In the Record of Wu, Chinese author Zhang Bo notes that Zhuge Ke was a loud spoken man and was about 182‚Äì184 cm tall, and that he had a crooked nose, wide forehead, large mouth, with little facial hair and eyebrows.

Elaeophora is a genus of parasitic nematodes which live attached to the interior surfaces of major arteries, veins and/or heart chambers in various large mammal hosts. Infestation with Elaeophora species is referred to as elaeophorosis. The species of Elaeophora have been found in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. Despite the fact that they produce aneurysms in the arteries and heart of their hosts which measure up to 2 cm in diameter, overt clinical symptoms of infestation are seldom reported, with the notable exception of E. schneideri infestation in sheep, elk, and moose.Pence, D.B. (1991) Elaeophorosis in wild ruminants. Bulletin of the Society for Vector Ecology 16(1):149-160.  Taxonomy  The type species Elaeophora poeli was first described as Filaria poeli in 1879. In 1912, the genus Elaeophora was created to distinguish this species from the other species of the genus Filaria.Railliet, A. and A.

General life cycle  Detailed life cycle studies have been reported for only one species of Elaeophora so far - E. schneideri. Microfilariae (not eggs) are shed by the adult female from her attachment site inside the lumen of the carotid artery of the definitive host. The microfilariae are carried through the blood stream and become lodged in the small capillaries of the skin in the head and facial areas. Blood-feeding horse flies ingest the microfilariae, which develop into infective larvae in the fly. The infective larvae enter a new definitive (mammal) host through the bite wound when the fly feeds again. The infective larvae migrate to secondary arterial sites, where they mature before migrating to the carotid artery. In the carotid artery, they mature into adults and reproduce sexually to produce microfilariae. It is assumed that the life cycles of other species of Elaeophora follow this general pattern.

The film stars Charlton Heston as Ron \\"Cat\\" Catlan, aging quarterback for American professional football's New Orleans Saints, and Jessica Walter as his wife. Musician Al Hirt plays himself, as do several real-life members of the 1968 Saints. The football scenes were shot at the Saints' then-home field, Tulane Stadium. Plot Ron \\"Cat\\" Catlan once led the New Orleans Saints to a championship (something the real-life Saints wouldn't experience until Super Bowl XLIV in the 2009 NFL season). After fifteen years in pro football, he tries to compensate for his failing skills with booze and an extramarital affair. (\\"You're not even worth the price of a ticket anymore\\", a fan yells at him after Cat refuses her an autograph.) Friend and teammate Richie Fowler (Bruce Dern) offers Cat a job with his auto- leasing company, and a management position in the computer industry is also on the table, but Catlan hesitates, insisting he can still lead the squad to future glory. The associate with the computer firm warns him not to put off making a decision: \\"There are a lot of kids coming out of college, Cat, and they're smart kids. A year from now, I might not be able to offer you a job driving the company truck.\\" Things are no better at home for Catlan: his long- suffering wife, Julie (Jessica Walter), threatens to leave him after too many booze-fueled outrages and late nights with other women. She begins to drift away into her own life, leading Cat to an abortive affair with Ann (Diana Muldaur). Cat finally begs Julie to stay, saying everything will be alright after he leads the Saints to another title. In the end, though, Catlan is crushed in a violent sack by a Dallas Cowboys player, seemingly ending his football career. Julie can be seen leaving the stadium, apparently unconcerned with her husband's condition. Catlan looks likes he takes his last breath and dies on the field; the movie ends and the viewer is left to decide what happened to him. Filming Despite having All-Pro signal-caller Billy Kilmer as an instructor, Charlton Heston did not make a very convincing pro quarterback. \\"I marveled at how skinny he was in a Saints uniform\\", said local DJ Bob Walker, who was an extra in the movie. \\"It hung on him like a cheap suit three sizes too big. When the cameras weren't rolling we watched him try to throw some passes. His receiver was 10-20 yards away and his alleged passes didn't come close.\\" Joe Wendryhoski, who basically played himself in the film as the Saints center, called Heston \\"a great guy, very sociable\\" who unfortunately \\"didn't have an athletic bone in his body. As a quarterback, he left a lot to be desired.\\" In the final scene when Catlan is crushed by the Dallas defense (actually portrayed by Saints players Mike Tilleman, Dave Rowe and Fred Whittingham), neither Heston nor the producer felt the hit on him was realistic enough, so Heston asked them to cut loose to really make it look authentic. On the second take, the trio slammed the actor to the ground, breaking three of his ribs. Reaction Number One was a commercial failure, but critical reaction was mixed. The film, and particularly Heston's performance, did earn a rave review from Howard Thompson of The New York Times, who called the \\"consistently engrossing\\" film, \\"...a succinct, stinging and often strong gridiron drama....\\" Thompson described Heston's performance as \\"a brooding, scorching and beautifully disciplined tour de force for the actor....If Heston could have been better, we don't know how.\\" Production Plans for the film were announced in 1966 to be made by the same team as The War Lover. The National Football League permitted the New Orleans Saints' name and jerseys to be used, as opposed to many football films featuring professional teams with fictional names. A championship in the team's past is alluded to, but likely would not have been a Super Bowl, since the film was shot in 1968 and the NFL's title game did not become the Super Bowl until 1971. (Furthermore, the Saints didn't even exist until they were founded on November 1, 1966, and began play the following season). Number One had never been issued on DVD for many years, but old copies on VHS existed. On November 12, 2015 however, MGM released the film on DVD for the first time.

He was previously the political editor of The Daily Monitor, a Ugandan daily newspaper, and was the presenter of Andrew Mwenda Live on KFM Radio in Kampala, Uganda's capital city. Background and education Mwenda was born in 1972 in Fort Portal, Kabarole District, in the Western Region of Uganda. His father is Mzee Phillip Muhanga of Fort Portal. Mwenda is a younger brother to Brigadier Kayanja Muhanga, a senior UPDF military officer. After attending primary school locally, Mwenda entered Nyakasura School where he completed his O-Level studies. He was then admitted to Busoga College Mwiri in the Eastern Region of Uganda for his A-Level education. He graduated with a High School Diploma from Mwiri. He was admitted to Makerere University, Uganda's oldest and largest public university, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism. Later, he won a Chevening Scholarship and was admitted to the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, where he graduated with a Master of Arts in Development Studies. He was a visiting fellow at Yale University, in 2010. He also studied as a fellow at Sa√Ød Business School at the University of Oxford in 2009. Mwenda was a John Knight Fellow at Stanford University between 2006 and 2007. He was a visiting lecturer at the University of Florida, Gainesville, in 2005, and a visiting fellow at the Africa Study Centre of the University of Leiden, in the Netherlands in 2003. In 2005, he was among sixteen senior journalists invited by the British government to discuss with Prime Minister Tony Blair the forthcoming report of the Commission for Africa. Work history Mwenda is the managing director of Independent Publications Limited, the publishers of The Independent, a current affairs newsmagazine. An admirer of Socrates, Karl Popper, and Frederick Von Hayek, he is an activist, a journalist, a columnist, a part-time poet, a businessman, and a social entrepreneur. Mwenda is a recognised African voice in the global debate on the failures of foreign aid to Africa and the need for investment and trade as drivers of growth. A TED speaker, he is a regular speaker at conferences across the world. Mwenda worked as a political editor of the Daily Monitor and general manager of its affiliate on FM radio, KFM, before establishing The Independent in 2007. He has worked as a consultant for the World Bank, the World Resources Institute, and Transparency International. He has also written for international news media like Der Spiegel, the International Herald Tribune, The New York Times, and Foreign Policy. He also has produced documentaries for BBC World television and radio. Mwenda has also authored and co-authored articles for international academic journals like Africa Affairs, the Journal of Modern African Studies, the Review of African Political Economy, the Journal of Commonwealth Studies, the Journal for Contemporary African Studies, and the Journal of Democracy on top of publishing chapters in several books. In April 2008, he was arrested and released on bail by the Ugandan government for \\"being in possession of seditious material and of publishing inflammatory articles\\". In August 2005, he was charged with sedition for broadcasting a discussion of the cause of death of Sudanese vice-president John Garang. Garang was killed when the Ugandan presidential helicopter smashed in a storm over a rebel area, on the way back from talks in Uganda. During his radio programme, the journalist accused the Ugandan government of \\"incompetence\\" and said they had put Garang on \\"a junk helicopter ... at night ... in poor weather ... over an insecure area\\". Community activism In July 2006, Mwenda appeared before the British House of Commons committee on Global Poverty to testify against aid to Africa. He has written widely on the effects of aid on the development process in Africa and been published in such prestigious newspapers as the International Herald Tribune and Der Spiegel and done radio and television documentaries for the BBC on this subject. Mr. Mwenda has also been widely quoted in international media, including the BBC, CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Times, The Economist, and many other newspapers, radio and television networks in Europe and North America. He has criticised aid agencies and charities for what he says is their ineffectiveness and collusion with corruption. He believes that western aid has been largely unhelpful for African development, since it encourages dependency, sustains wars and fuels corrupt states. He argues that aid goes to the least deserving states, those that have failed their people, rather than those that have reformed. In June 2007, he gave a speech about these issues at the TED conference in Arusha, Tanzania. In 2014, Mwenda was among the petitioners for annulling The Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2014. On 3 February 2019, Mwenda launched the Uganda National Peoples' Democratic Revolutionary Front (UNPDRF) in the bushes of Kanyandahi in western Uganda with six men and five sticks. He declared himself supreme shogun of the UNPDRF and Charles Onyango Obbo its chief ideologue. On social media, he declared that the cause of the UNPDRF was \\"battle Museveni's corrupt dictatorship, Besigye's radical extremism and Bobi Wine's empty-headed demagoguery.\\" The UNPDRF shares a similar name with a left wing political coalition in Ethiopia, The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF)led by Ethiopian prime minister Ahmed Abiy, but it is unlikely that the UNPDRF is supported or associated to the EPRDF.

Smith, telling the story of Tony Lock's childhood as a victim of sexual abuse and his attempts as an adult to escape his tortured past. The film explores the reluctance of authorities and families to confront sexual abuse as well as the impact it has on victims' lives. The film was based on the story \\"Slaying the Monster\\", in the book Writing on Tombstones.\\"Burying the monster\\". The Age, September 19 2002.  Synopsis  Tony Lock recalls himself as a child in the 1960s at the age of four, part of an aloof family in Trentham, Victoria. His father was an alcoholic agricultural labourer. Tony developed a warm attachment to his father's workmate and drinking friend Gordon Kerr, but the older man then sexually assaulted both Tony and his younger brother periodically ten years before his parents unexpectedly saw this for themselves and were forced to acknowledge what was happening.\\"On telling a difficult story\\". The Age, September 19 2002. By Clare Kermon Tony and his brother were then sent away to live with family in Melbourne. Tony seemed to be living a normal, happy life, but as he aged into his twenties he lost his job and drifted in a life of alcoholism and drug abuse. Eventually Tony left for Western Australia to come clean. After hearing radio reports of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, Tony returned to his hometown in 1995 to have Gordon charged. Despite having a confession from Gordon himself, the police refused to initiate criminal proceedings. One night soon afterwards Tony became very agitated; he pleaded with the police to detain him so he would not harm himself or anyone else but was ignored. Tony went to Gordon's home and knocked on the door, holding an axe for self defense. Gordon opened the door and pointed a gun at him. During a moment when the gun was pointed away Tony struck Gorden with the axe. Tony was charged with murder and convicted of manslaughter under a plea bargain in 1996. As he already served his sentence in custody before being convicted, Tony was released immediately afterwards. The film concludes in 2002 with Tony, who, while functioning in a comparatively normal life, still remains frequently traumatised by his experiences.

History The rifle was designed by a Polish engineer J√≥zef Maroszek (1904-1985). He was known mainly as a designer of the Polish anti-tank rifle wz.1935 \\"Ur\\". Maroszek was one of the three winners of Poland‚Äôs 1934 self-loading rifle trials. Several prototypes and pre-production samples of his rifle were manufactured from 1936 to 1938.Gwozdz & Zarzycki 1993, p.173 After a Polish army order was received, small scale production began in 1938. It is believed only about 150 rifles of this pattern were completed before the German invasion of Poland. Production was not resumed under the German occupation. The wz.38M rifles were manufactured by the Zbrojownia Nr. 2 (Arsenal No.2) in Warsaw (Praga). Barrels were supplied by the Panstwowa Fabryka Karabinow (State Rifle Factory) in Warsaw. Kbsp wz. 1938M Kbsp wz.38M rifle with serial no. 1014 The highest serial number observed is 1054 (it is assumed numbering started from \\"1001\\", not counting the prototypes and pre-production examples).CollectibleFirearms.com The decision was made to begin serial production of the rifle at the Fabryka Broni (the Arms Factory) in Radom in 1938. However, it is unclear if any rifles of this pattern left the Radom factory before the German invasion (all the surviving examples display Arsenal Nr. 2's \\"Zbr.2\\" markings). Maroszek stated he had seen a group of German soldiers armed with wz.38M rifles in occupied Warsaw. This is perhaps the only indication Maroszek rifles were reissued to Nazi forces. The rifle is gas operated with the gas tube located under the barrel. It features a Browning/Petter system in which the bolt tilts up to lock; in the case of the Kbsp wz.1938M, against the front edge of the ejection/loading aperture in the top of the receiver.https://www.forgottenweapons.com/polands-battle-rifle-the- wz-38m-at-james-d-julia/ It has a ten-round non-detachable magazine loaded from Mauser stripper clips. The safety lever is located on the right side of the receiver, just above the trigger. The rifle has a Mauser-style tangent leaf rear sight graduated from . The bayonet lug accepts a standard Polish issue wz.29, and the barrel is equipped with a muzzle brake to ameliorate recoil. For a pioneering self-loading rifle, its design is strikingly advanced in its simplicity and functionality; for example, it's composed of several sub-sections interlocked by a single removable steel pin, and thus can be disassembled in moments. Today, this is a difficult to find military rifle on the collector market. There are only nine known examples in collections around the world (1. Polish Army Museum, Warsaw, Poland, deactivated; 2. Central Armed Forces Museum, Moscow, Russia; 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. private collections in the USA; 9. private collection in Germany). The known serial numbers are: 1014, 1017, 1019, 1027, 1030, 1040, 1048, 1054. (The Russian museum and the Ohio collection rifles serial numbers are unknown.) In April 2017, serial number 1048 was acquired at auction by the Polish government for $69,000. Military usage There is only one known example of military usage of this rifle in action which, almost uniquely, was by Maroszek himself. While personnel were evacuating from Instytut Techniki Uzbrojenia (Weaponry Technology Institute) the train they were traveling in was attacked near the city of Zdo≈Çbunow by two German warplanes flying at low altitude. As he states in his memoirs, Maroszek kept shooting through the window, eventually killing the gunner and wounding the pilot of one of the planes, forcing it to land.

He was a grandmaster of the Wing Chun style and one of the few disciples of martial artist Yuen Kay Shan. Early years Sum Nung was born in Peru in 1926. He was of a Chinese father and a Peruvian mother. When he was about 7 years of age, he traveled to China with the father to visit his grandmother. During his visit, Japan attacked China during the Second World War. The Japanese bombarded their house and his father died, he was then left alone with the grandmother. Communication between the outside as well as within China was terminated. Master Sum lost contact with his mother and his wealthy life, to live poorly as many during the war. When he was about 12 years of age, he was entrusted to work as an apprentice in the restaurant \\"Sky and Sea in the state of Foshan. He had a hard time there since he was often beaten up and humiliated because he was half Chinese and half Peruvian. They made fun of him because of his sharp-pointed and big nose. Career as a martial artist The chef of the restaurant called Cheung Bo was a master of Wing Chun Kung Fu and began teaching him how to defend himself against his assailants. Then in 1941, the famous Yuen Kay Shan owner of great properties in that state and winner of a thousand death fights/combats, asked Cheung's permission to teach Sam some more techniques since he discovered he had talent. But Sam looking at the master's slim and low physique, doubted his talent and responded that he had nothing to learn from him. Then, Yuen Kay Shan said because it was his passion, demonstrated and gave him a slight beating so Sam was convinced that he could learn a lot from him and was now his disciple. Sum Nung developed a great reputation toward the quality of his Kung Fu, he often had to fight to defend himself against the discrimination for being a foreigner. In 1943 he began teaching in Foshan in the village's deep temple to students like Sum Jee. In the late 1940s, he moved to the city of Guangzhou, where he taught Wing Chun to members of several local trade unions. In 1947, he was a professor of Wing Chun in the Guangzhou union machinery. The following year, he opened a natural (herbal) or traditional medicine clinic and was a Chinese doctor at Daisun Street and also ran a martial arts school. Philosophy Hobby and Philosophy Sam's hobby was bird fighting and he said he would not feed birds that were not good at fighting, a philosophy that influenced the choice of his students such as Felix Leong, whom Sum received Felix as a student because he was already a master of Wing Chun under master Lai Chi Wa and he won the title of Australian National Martial arts champion in 1977, the following year he fought in New Zealand and ended up as champion of South Pacific. In popular culture The 2016 film Ip Man 3 martial arts film directed by Wilson Yip, and produced by Raymond Wong Pak-ming, which was the third in the series of films based on the life of Ip Man, Grandmaster of Wing Chun, with Donnie Yen in the lead role, also featuring Mike Tyson and Bruce Lee, one of Ip's students, played by Danny Chan Kwok-kwan. The actor Zhang Jin was cast in the supposed role of Sum Nung, who was also an expert in Wing Chun and an able opponent of Ip Man in complex battles. However, due to Sum Nung being a disciple of Yuen Kay Shan, the name Sum Nung was changed to Cheung Tin-chi to avoid conflicts with Yuen Kay Shan's lineage and descendants, which was previously erupted in a controversy of Yuen Kay Shan being misrepresented in the 2010 film The Legend Is Born: Ip Man back then. Legacy Nowadays, many Wing Chun practitioners in Guangzhou are his descendants. Over the years, he carefully taught selected students. Sum Nung contributed in training many students who have helped to preserve and disseminate their style throughout the world. Among which are; Felix Leong, Sum Jee, Cheung Chut (Cheung Bo's son), Kwok Jin Fen, Leung King-chiu (Leung Dai Chiu), Dong Chuen Kam, Ngo Lui Kay, Kwok Wah Ping, Lee Chi Yiu, Wong Wah (Tom Wong).

A shikhara over the garbhagriha chamber where the presiding deity is enshrined is the most prominent and visible part of a Hindu temple of North India.http://www.msc-sahc.org/upload/docs/new.docs/2008_SVardia.pdf In South India, the equivalent term is vimana; unlike the shikhara, this refers to the whole building, including the sanctum beneath. In the south, shikhara is a term for the top stage of the vimana only, which is usually a dome capped with a finial;Harle, 167 this article is concerned with the northern form. The southern vimana is not to be confused with the elaborate gateway-towers of south Indian temples, called gopuram, which are often taller and more prominent features in large temples. Forms Shikhara can be classified into three main forms:Hardy, 270 *Latina. The shikhara has four faces, which may include projections or ratha within each face. All the elements run smoothly up the face in a curve. The most common.Hardy, 270-272 They are also sometimes called \\"homogeneous\\" shikhara, as opposed to the next two types, which may be called \\"heterogeneous\\". *Sekhari. The latina shape has added engaged (attached) sub-spires or spirelets called urushringa echoing the main shape. These may run up most of the face. There may be more than one size of these, sometimes called secondary and tertiary. Tertiary spirelets are typically near the ends of the face or on the corners.Hardy, 273-274 *Bhumija. The tower has miniature spires, in horizontal and vertical rows, all the way to the top, creating a grid-like effect on each face. The tower is generally less strongly vertical in overall shape, often approaching a pyramidal shape. Mainly found in the northern Deccan and West India. History The early history of the Hindu shikhara is unclear,Harle, 111, 136-139 but the Buddhist Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya has a straight-sided shikhara tower over 55 metres (180 feet) high, with an amalaka near the top. The current structure dates from the Gupta Empire, in the 5th‚Äì6th century CE. When the temple acquired its shikhara tower, today considered more characteristic of Hindu temples, is uncertain.Harle, 201; Michell, 228-229 However the current structure of the Mahabodhi Temple may represent a restoration of earlier work of the 2nd or 3rd century CE. A plaque from Kumrahar dated 150-200 CE, based on its dated Kharoshthi inscriptions and combined finds of Huvishka coins, already shows the Mahabodhi Temple in its current shape with a stepped truncated pyramid and a stupa finial on top, together with devotional images of the Buddha and the elephant-crowned Pillar of Ashoka next to the entrance.Buddhist Architecture, Le Huu Phuoc, Grafikol 2009, p.242 It is thought that this shape of a truncated pyramid was derived from the design of the stepped stupas which had developed in Gandhara, as seen in the stupas of Jaulian, with an elongated structure formed of a succession of steps with niches containing Buddha images, alternating with Greco-Roman pillars, and topped by a stupa.Le Huu Phuoc, Buddhist Architecture, pp.238-248 By at least 600 CE in Odisha,Harle, 158-159 and perhaps somewhat later in the Deccan Plateau and West India,Harle, 136-139, 166-171 the Latina form of the shikhara is well-established, with an amalaka disk-stone at the top, and then a kalasha urn. There is often a sukanasa feature over the entrance door.Harle, 140 The forms with smaller subsidiary spires begin in the 10th century,Harle, 219 and from then on tend to predominate. The Khajuraho Group of Monuments has several early forms from early in the century, though Latina ones reappear after about 1050, in examples like the Vamana Temple.Harle, 232-235 The bhumija spire probably first appears around 1000-1025, with other temples begun in the 1050s, such as the Shiv Mandir, Ambarnath.Harle, 230-232 Major styles rathas) of the Lingaraja Temple in Bhubaneswar Shikharas form an element in the many styles of Hindu temple architecture, of which the three most common are: * the Nagara style prevalent in northern India. The shikhara is a high curved shape, and so called. In the north-east, the local term deul or deula is more often used, both for towers and often the whole temple. In Odisha a Rekha Deula is the sanctum and the tower over it; gandi is also a term for the upper tower only, equating to shikhara. In Odisha the curve is very slight until the top, and the amalaka rather large, typically supported by four lion sculptures facing out.Harle, 246 Of the many temples in Bhubaneswar, only the Rajarani Temple has significant spirelets.Harle, 246, 249 * the Vesara style, a synthesis of the two others, seen mostly in Karnataka and most commonly in Hoysala and later Chalukya temples. In the vesara style, the tower moves towards a lower conical shape, with highly ornate carving. * the Dravidian style prevalent in southern India : The equivalent of the shikhara is the vimana. The superstructure above the sanctum is typically more like a four-sided pyramid in overall shape, consisting of progressively smaller storeys of pavilions (talas), with a profile that is normally straight rather than curved. The Dravidian superstructure is generally highly ornate. In every style of shikhara/vimana, the structure culminates with a \\"kalasha\\", or urn for offerings, or water-pot, at its peak.

In anatomical terms of location, the dorsal side is up, and the ventral side is down. The supine position is the 180¬∞ contrast. Two soldiers in prone position Supine position and prone position Etymology  The word \\"prone,\\" meaning \\"naturally inclined to something, apt, liable,\\" has been recorded in English since 1382; the meaning \\"lying face-down\\" was first recorded in 1578, but is also referred to as \\"lying down\\" or \\"going prone.\\" \\"Prone\\" derives from the Latin pronus: \\"bent forward, inclined to,\\" from the adverbial form of the prefix pro- \\"forward.\\" Both the original, literal, and the derived figurative sense were used in Latin, but the figurative is older in English.  Anatomy  In anatomy, the prone position is a position of the body lying face down. It is opposed to the supine position which is face up. Using the terms defined in the anatomical position, the ventral side is down, and the dorsal side is up. Concerning the forearm, prone refers to that configuration where the palm of the hand is directed posteriorly, and the radius and ulna are crossed.  Shooting  In competitive shooting, the prone position is the position of a shooter lying face down on the ground. It is considered the easiest and most accurate position as the ground provides extra stability. It is one of the positions in three positions events. For many years (1932-2016), the only purely prone Olympic event was the 50 meter rifle prone; however, this has since been dropped from the Olympic program. Both men and women still have the 50 meter rifle three positions as an Olympic shooting event. Many video games (particularly first-person shooters) allow the player character to go into the prone position. =ISSF 50 meter= Male and female shooters shoot a .22 LR calibre rifle (smallbore) over a course of fire of 60 shots to count in 50 minutes (when using electronic targets). These are shot after an unlimited number of sighting shots, which must be shot during the 15-minute preparation and sighting period. If necessary, an 'elimination' course of fire may be undertaken to reduce the number of shooters to the number that may fire simultaneously in a 'qualification' round. Up until 2013, each shot could score from 0 to 10 points, with no decimal points (e.g. 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, but not 3.2 or 9.8, etc.) making the maximum score for elimination or qualification round 600 points. After 2013, shots are scored as decimal values (e.g. 9.8 rather than what would have been a 9 under integer scoring), so the maximum score from a 60 shot match is 654.0. Up until 2018, the top eight shooters in the qualification round were selected to shoot 'shot-for-shot' in an 'Olympic' final. Prior to 2013, this consisted of ten additional shots scored to one decimal place, so the maximum possible score was 109.0. This score was then added to the score for the qualification round; this summed score was used to determine final rankings and thus medallists. Starting in the 2013 season and continuing to the beginning of the 2018 season, a new finals format was introduced, where again the top 8 shooters in the qualification round shot against each other, only this time with the qualification scored being discarded and the number of shots being raised to 24. These shots were still scored decimally, so the maximum possible score under this new format was 261.6. From January 2018, the final for this event was discarded entirely; competition rankings were determined by the score obtained in the 60 shot match only. =NSRA= The UK national shooting body also has courses of fire for prone shooting at multiple distances and targets. Commonly, this is split into what is known as 'short' and 'long' ranges. Short range The NSRA generally refers to shooting .22 LR calibre rifles over a distance of between 15 yards and 25 metres 'indoors' as being short range shooting. Targets are generally outward gauging (touching a ring on the target scores the lower of the two adjacent scores), except on some of the Schools and older targets (e.g. 5 bull targets). Being indoors, no allowance is necessary for wind, light or other changes. Shots are scored as integer values from 0 to 10, with no decimal places. Long range UK long range shooting is generally over either 50 yards, 50 metres or 100 yards distance outdoors. Targets vary, but generally, the ISSF 50M (scaled) is used for 50 yards or 50 metres, and a proportionally sized target is used for 100 yards. A 50-yard, 50-metre or 100-yard target is generally constructed to allow 20 shots to count, to be executed during one 'detail' of 20 minutes duration. Sighting shots are included in that time period. Outdoors, variables such as light, wind, temperature, humidity and mirage affect the target image and bullet trajectory. To help shooters, most ranges have wind flags placed at useful positions around the range to display the wind conditions. Pilots Hang glider pilot in harness. The prone position is also used to describe the way pilots and other crew may be positioned in an aircraft; lying on their stomachs rather than seated in a normal upright position. During World War II, the bomb aimer in some bombers would be positioned this way to be better able to view the ground through a transparent panel or bubble in the nose of a bomber. Later, it was suggested that a pilot in the prone position might be more effective in some kinds of high-speed aircraft, because it would permit the pilot to withstand a greater g-force in the upward and downward direction with respect to the plane, and many speculative designs of the 1950s featured this arrangement. However, it never became mainstream, as testing revealed that the increased difficulty of operating aircraft controls in the prone position outweighed the advantages. Two examples of this approach are seen in the Savoia-Marchetti SM.93 and the Gloster Meteor F8 \\"Prone Pilot\\". Modern hang gliders are typically piloted in the prone position.

The last image is of Rabin disappearing under a pile of security men to screams of horrified onlookers, after which the photographer stopped filming and hit the ground.Serge Schmemann, The New York Times International, \\"A Trial, a Tape and a Warning in the Rabin Murder Case\\", December 20, 1995. Immediately after the assassination, Kempler submitted the video to the Shamgar National Inquiry Commission, which was tasked with researching the security failures. Forty- five days after the Rabin assassination, and after the Shamgar commission granted permission to release the video to the public, the Israeli TV showed the non-static parts of this video with commentary. The public was shocked by the ease of access that the murderer had, and by the security gaps. In his sole television appearance the night his video was broadcast, Kempler reflected on the thoughts and feelings that he experienced during and after taking the video. The Kempler video was shown three times on the Israeli TV Channel 2 in late December 1995, after it acquired the rights and edited it for broadcasting. The video received international publicity and parts of it were shown in many countries. According to reports Kempler received $350,000 from the Israeli News Company and Yedioth Ahronoth, a major newspaper in Israel, for his video footage. The sum or most of it was recovered by selling the rights for broadcasting to other news agencies. The Kempler video was used as evidence during the trial of Yigal Amir as well as by the independent judicial Shamgar commission. Partially based on the Kempler video, the Shamgar commission concluded that Amir was guilty and that Carmi Gillon, head of Shin Bet should be removed from his position. Proponents of the Yitzhak Rabin assassination conspiracy theories also make use of this video.

The actual size of the aperture will depend on the focal length of the lens. Deep focus is a photographic and cinematographic technique using a large depth of field. Depth of field is the front-to-back range of focus in an image‚Äîthat is, how much of it appears sharp and clear. In deep focus, the foreground, middle-ground, and background are all in focus. Deep focus is normally achieved by choosing a small aperture. The aperture of a camera determines how much light enters through the lens, so achieving deep focus requires a bright scene or long exposure. Wide-angle lenses also make a larger portion of the image appear sharp. It is also possible to achieve the illusion of deep focus with optical tricks (split-focus diopter) or by compositing two or more images together. It is the aperture of a camera lens that determines the depth of field. The opposite of deep focus is shallow focus, in which the plane of the image that is in focus is very shallow.  Deep focus and deep space  When deep focus is used, filmmakers often combine it with deep space (also called deep staging). Deep space is a part of mise- en-sc√®ne, placing significant actors and props in different planes of the picture. Directors and cinematographers often use deep space without using deep focus, being either an artistic choice or because they do not have resources to create a deep focus look, or both. Directors may use deep focus in only some scenes or even just some shots. Other auteurs choose to use it consistently throughout the movie, either as a stylistic choice or because they believe it represents reality better. Filmmakers such as Akira Kurosawa, Stanley Kubrick, Kenji Mizoguchi, Orson Welles, Masahiro Shinoda, Akio Jissoji, Terry Gilliam, Jean Renoir, Jacques Tati, James Wong Howe, and Gregg Toland all used deep focus as part of their signature style. The 14-mm lens has become informally known as \\"The Gilliam\\" among filmmakers because of Terry Gilliam's frequent use of it at least since Brazil.  Deep focus and different formats  The choice of shooting format affects how easy it would be to achieve a deep focus look. This is because the size of the sensor or film gauge dictates what particular lens focal length would be used in order to achieve a desired viewing angle. Smaller sensors or film gauges will require an overall range of shorter focal lengths to achieve any desired viewing angle than larger sensors or film gauges. Because depth of field is a characteristic of lens focal length (in addition to aperture and focus distance setting), it is easier to achieve a deep-focus look with a smaller imaging sensor or film gauge. For example: a 40mm lens will give a 30-degree horizontal angle of view in the Super35 format. To achieve the same viewing angle with a 1/2\\" 16:9 sensor, you would need a 13mm lens. A 13mm lens inherently has much more depth-of-field than a 40mm lens. To achieve the same depth of field with a 40mm lens would require a very small aperture, which in turn would require far more light, and therefore time and expense. Some filmmakers make deliberate use of the deep focus capabilities of digital formats. Miami Vice (Michael Mann, 2006) is among the many big budget movies that have been shot digitally in recent years. Cinematographer Dion Beebe had this to say: > We also decided that there were attributes of HD technology we liked and > wanted to exploit, like the increased depth of field. Because of the > cameras' chip size (2/3\\"), they have excessive depth of field that we > decided not to fight, but rather utilize.Holben, Jay: \\"Partners in Crime\\", > American Cinematographer, August 2006.  Split-focus diopter  In the 70s, directors made frequent use of the split-focus diopter. With this invention it was possible to have one plane in focus in one part of the picture and a different plane in focus in the other half of the picture. This was and still is very useful for the anamorphic widescreen format, which has less depth of field. A split diopter is half convex glass that attaches in front of the camera's main lens to make half the lens nearsighted. The lens can focus on a plane in the background and the diopter on a foreground. A split diopter does not create real deep focus, only the illusion of this. What distinguishes it from traditional deep focus is that there is not continuous depth of field from foreground to background; the space between the two sharp objects is out of focus. Because split focus diopters only cover half the lens, shots in which they are used are characterized by a blurred line between the two planes in focus. Manipulated deep focus is not a new phenomenon, as it had also been created in other ways during the golden age of 20th century. The diopter gave the opportunity for spectacular deep focus-compositions that would have been impossible to achieve otherwise. In the American New Wave, director Brian De Palma explored the possibilities of the split-focus diopter extensively, as did other 70s films such as Robert Wise's The Andromeda Strain and Star Trek: The Motion Picture.  Use in modern films  Starting in the 80s, American cinema has developed a trend that film scholar David Bordwell calls intensified continuity.Bordell, David (2002). \\"Intensified Continuity: Visual Style in Contemporary American Film\\", in Film Quarterly, vol. 55, no. 3. Bordwell claims that: # The average length of each shot in a film has become shorter over the years # Scenes are built up by closer framing # More extreme focal lengths are used # The scenes include an increased number of camera moves This trend has led to deep focus becoming less common in Hollywood movies. As mentioned in Bordwell's second point, master shots where two or more characters hold a conversation have gone out of fashion, lessening the need for deep focus. In a contemporary Hollywood movie a dialogue scene may consist only of tight close-ups, with the master shot abandoned. If more than one plane in the image contains narrative information, filmmakers switch focus (\\"rack focusing\\") instead of keeping both focal planes sharp. In addition, modern sets tend to have less lighting for more comfortable working conditions, and use of deep focus tends to require more light. The development of intensified continuity may be due to directors' desire to capture the action or dialogue from many different angles and views. Getting these shots is called coverage. The U.S. film critic Dave Kehr explains it this way: > If there is a single word that sums up the difference between filmmaking at > the middle of the 20th century and the filmmaking of today, it is > \\"coverage\\". Derived from television, it refers to the increasingly common > practice of using multiple cameras for a scene (just as television would > cover a football game). To stage a whole scene in one shot is no longer common. Director Steven Soderbergh claims: > That kind of staging is a lost art, which is too bad. The reason they no > longer work that way is because it means making choices, real choices, and > sticking to them. (...) That's not what people do now. They want all the > options they can get in the editing room. An extreme case of filming in one-shot is the feature-length film, Russian Ark (2002), recorded in one take.

It and variants have been used as a motto by a number of different groups. The form Esse, non Videri (\\"to act, not to seem to be\\") is the Wallenberg family motto. History Esse quam videri is found in Cicero's essay On Friendship (Laelius de Amicitia, chapter 98). Virtute enim ipsa non tam multi praediti esse quam videri volunt (\\"Few are those who wish to be endowed with virtue rather than to seem so\\"). Just a few years after Cicero, Sallust used the phrase in his Bellum Catilinae (54.6), writing that Cato the Younger esse quam videri bonus malebat (\\"He preferred to be good rather than to seem so\\"). Previous to both Romans, Aeschylus used a similar phrase in Seven Against Thebes at line 592, at which the scout (angelos) says of the seer/priest Amphiaraus: (ou g√†r doke√Æn √°ristos, all' e√Ænai th√©lei: \\"he doesn't want to seem, but to be the bravest\\").

Beaker Street, which first aired on clear channel KAAY AM 1090 in Little Rock, AR, from 1966 through 1972, was the first underground music program broadcast regularly on a commercial AM radio station. The show attracted a legion of fans across the western hemisphere with its pioneering format, which featured long album cuts from artists who otherwise would not get airplay. Clyde is the prototype of the laid-back late- night DJ. His on-air comments are delivered softly and deliberately over a background of space music. Clyde was one of the pioneers of the album-oriented rock format which became popular on FM radio in the 1970s. The stage name Clyde Clifford came from an inside joke at KAAY. The on-air personalities took their stage names from the board of directors of LIN broadcasting, the owners of KAAY. Clyde W. Clifford was the comptroller general of LIN. To be fair, there were actually a number of other personalities that followed Clyde Clifford. Among the many people who hosted the show after Clyde, there were several Ken Knights. As mentioned earlier, many names were given to the jocks to use at KAAY until 1976 when Dick Downes became the Program Director replacing Wayne Moss. In order to give the show more verisimilitude, Downes had the next host use his real name. So, there was Beaker Street with Stuart (McRae) for the last few years into the mid-seventies. Stuart truly looked and lived the part of the '70s Hippy DJ, complete with the hair, beard and jeans. His approach was very laid-back and mellow, and his music selections were excellent. Under Downes' direction, Stuart (he just used his first name on air) expanded the show from the original three hours to a full five and a half (11:00 PM to 4:30 AM) achieving some of the best ratings the show ever attained, besting the 10 PM lead-in hour with twice the audience. Unfortunately, McRae's rabbi, Downes, departed and when replacement Carl Hamilton took over the Program Director position in early 1977, he decided to end Beaker Street (it wasn't consistent with the rest of the day) to much protest from all over the world (KAAY had an amazing signal). The last Beaker Street show was done by Don Payne. Stuart McRae resigned more or less on-the- spot after being informed of the end of Beaker Street on KAAY. Beaker Street with Clyde Clifford currently airs on the Arkansas Rocks network of radio station on friday nights from 9pm to 12am US central time. Awards and recognition Dale Seidenschwarz (aka Clyde Clifford) was inducted into the Missouri Music Hall of Fame in 2014.

The community initially used vBulletin forum but switched to a new engine they developed called a New KASKUS in mid-2012. History KASKUS was created on November 6, 1999 by Indonesian students Andrew Darwis, Ronald Stephanus, Ken Dean Lawadinata and Budi Dharmawan. KASKUS was originally intended as an informal forum of Indonesian students abroad. The name \\"KASKUS\\" itself is an abbreviation of the word \\"Kasak-Kusuk\\". PC Magazine Indonesia named Kaskus in August 2005PC Magazine Indonesia ‚Äì as being the best site and largest online community and in 2006, as the choice of readers in 2006. On May 23, 2006, the management was forced to change their .com domain to .us, because of the spread of the virus Brontok which was created with the aim of attacking large sites in Indonesia. By the beginning of April 2007, KASKUS management added two new Dell Servers to improve KASKUS's website performance. In July 2008, KASKUS management decided to operate the server in Indonesia. For this purpose, KASKUS bought eight Dell PowerEdge 2950 servers and operated them via a network of open IXP. This resulted in multiplied access to KASKUS and eventually added eight more servers to handle the requests. In March 2008, after convincing his cousin Andrew to Expand and create a proper business out of KASKUS, Ken Dean Lawadinata came on board as partner and CEO. PT Darta Media Indonesia was then created as the parent company of KASKUS, by the end of 2008 KASKUS went on a major expansion and changes in its product line and vision to become the No.1 Largest Local site in Indonesia, and received its first 1 Million user base. In 2011, KASKUS management announced the expansion of its business by establishing a relationship of cooperation with the investment of Global Digital Prima into KASKUS, which is a subsidiary of Djarum. In addition, KASKUS plans to increase the number of servers up to 250. They also plan on recruiting up to 80 new personnel. In August 2012, Kaskus had more than 4,000,000 registered accounts. On May 26, 2012, KASKUS management was forced to change their domain from .us to .co.id because of errors on the Domain Name System (DNS). In 2012, KASKUS management developed their own forum engine officially called KASKUS 2.0, called the New KASKUS by KASKUS's users.[3] When the engine reached a beta stage, selected users used the forum with the engine, while non-selected users still used the vBulletin version. By the end of 2012, complete conversion to KASKUS 2.0 was completed. Some threads and posts could not be transferred to the new engine, so KASKUS management decided to keep them accessible through the vBulletin version of the forum (called Old KASKUS by the users). By 2014 KASKUS had more than 25 million unique users and was a famous local site in Indonesia. On this year KASKUS also went through some changes with Ken Dean Lawadinata after his 7 years of turnaround of KASKUS from a 1-man forum site to Indonesia's leading online forum, moved up to become the new Chairman of PT Darta Media Indonesia, with Martin Hartono assuming the day-to-day operation as the new CEO. Andrew Darwis also moved from his office of CTO to become the Chief Community Officer for KASKUS. In 2015, KASKUS story is in production to be adapted to become a major Cinema movie with codename \\"Ken & Andrew, The movie\\". Planned to be released in 2016.

The Nomad name and costume were created by writer Steve Englehart and artist Sal Buscema as an alternate identity for the original Captain America, Steve Rogers, in Captain America #180 (December 1974). The identity was revived by writer J. M. DeMatteis for a minor character named Edward Ferbel in Captain America #261-263 (September - November 1981). The same writer later gave the title to its best known claimant Jack Monroe in Captain America #281 (May 1983). Other claimants of the code name are Rikki Barnes and Steve Rogers's adopted son Ian Rogers. Steve Rogers Cover to Captain America #180, the first appearance of the original Nomad. Art by Gil Kane. The original Nomad is an alternate identity that Steve Rogers adopts after he abandons the Captain America costume and title. In Captain America #180 (December 1974) Rogers becomes disillusioned with the United States government, when he discovers that a high ranking government official (heavily hinted to be the then President of the United States Richard Nixon) is the leader of the terrorist organization known as the Secret Empire. Rogers then decides to abandon his Captain America identity, feeling that he cannot continue to serve America after this latest discovery has shattered his faith in the nation's status. However, a confrontation with Hawkeye (disguised as the Golden Archer) forces Rogers to realize that he cannot abandon a life of heroism, and he subsequently takes on the name \\"Nomad\\" (as it means \\"man without a country\\") adopting a new dark blue and yellow uniform with no patriotic markings on it at all. This identity is short-lived, with Rogers maintaining it for a mere four issues of the comic to varying degrees of success; he even trips over his own cape at one point. At the conclusion of Captain America #184 (April 1975) Rogers returns to the role of Captain America when he realizes that he could champion America's ideals without blindly supporting its government. Edward Ferbel Introduced in Captain America #261 (September 1981), the second Nomad was Edward Ferbel, a short-lived character who is given the Nomad costume and equipment by the Red Skull in an effort to discredit Captain America. He is killed by an agent of the Skull, the Ameridroid, in Captain America #263 (November 1981). Jack Monroe The third and best known Nomad is Jack Monroe, who was formerly known as the third Bucky. He was created by writer Steve Englehart and artist Sal Buscema in Captain America #153 (September 1972). Rikki Barnes After the events of the Onslaught Reborn mini-series, a version of Rikki Barnes, the female Bucky established in the Heroes Reborn Captain America series, now resides in the mainstream Marvel Universe, and has befriended the Young Avenger known as Patriot in the hopes of contacting the new Captain America (the original Bucky, now free of his Winter Soldier programming).Captain America #600, June 2009 In September 2009, Rikki Barnes took on the identity of Nomad in the mini-series, Nomad: Girl Without A World, by Sean McKeever and David Baldeon.

With around 300 congregations, Protestantism has grown rapidly in the last decade. History The first Protestants in Laos arrived at the start of the twentieth century. However, none became firmly established until after independence and then British and American denominations arrived.  Denominations  The Lao Evangelical Church is one of the Holiness churches of Laos and has branches is the majority of provinces. Another denomination is Seventh-day Adventist church of Laos which was founded in 1973. There are many neo-Protestant groups in Laos with missionary actions are strongest towards minority groups, many of which refuse to take part in everyday society. The Mission √âvang√©lique au Laos (MEL) is one of the largest Christian denominations of Laos. The MEL is a Christian Brethren church. Most members of the MEL belong to ethnic minorities of the South of Laos, and membership exceeds 10,000. US Accusations According to the US government, there have been instances of the Laotian government attempting to make Christians renounce their faith, and have several times closed down Christian churches. They also say that there are two religious prisoners in Laos, both members of the Lao Evangelical Church and that, in 2005, a church in Savannakhet Province was closed down by the government. Lao officials consider this slander, denying that they have closed any churches and saying that those Christians imprisoned are not imprisoned because of their religion but for other reasons. No religious groups within the country have mentioned their churches being closed or their clergy being imprisoned, even the Evangelicals (and only them) who did mention other complaints, such as hindering attempts to build new churches.

It is the only mosque in Singapore to have land allocated for it before the appointment of its Mosque Building Committee by the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore, MUIS. Profile The Al-Istiqamah Mosque logo Masjid Al Istiqamah is the second mosque to be built under Phase 3 of the Mosque Building Fund scheme headed by Muis. The building is located at Serangoon North Estate, at the corner of Yio Chu Kang Road and Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3, with the front entrance at Serangoon North Avenue 2, directly facing Blk 139 on the opposite side of the street. The new mosques built within this phase are named after virtuous qualities as a continuation from the first one ‚Äì Masjid Al-Khair (The Good). Initially, Muis had suggested the name \\"As-Sobr\\" (The Patient) for this mosque but after consultation with a few local Islamic scholars, the name \\"Al-Istiqamah\\" (the Constant) was chosen. The three-storeyed mosque with a combination of designs from the Nusantara, Middle East and Mauritius can cater to a maximum of 3,300 worshippers at any one time. Its convertible concept enables the optimisation of space and multiple functionalities of the rooms. The building is divided into two general areas, viz. the i'tikaf section occupying the 'front' portion, and the multi-purpose section making up the 'rear'. The i'tikaf area which is roofed by solid timber can accommodate about 480, 330 and 270 worshippers on levels one, two and three respectively.  Founding  When the plot for the mosque building was purchased on August 12, 1992, the fund raising arm of the JPM (Mosque Building Committee) was not even formed! The estimated amount needed was S$700,000 for the basic requirements in the initial stage of building. So few people came forward to volunteer their services that an advertisement had to be put out in the Berita Harian newspaper. When the JPM was eventually formed in October 1994 together with JPM Pasir Ris (which went on to build Masjid Al-Istighfar) and JPM Bishan (Masjid An-Nahdhah), a different challenge existed ‚Äì that of the 'competition' to raise funds against the neighbouring, more established mosques: Masjid Haji Yusoff in Kovan which sought to rebuild, and both Masjid En-Naeem in Hougang and Masjid Al-Muttaqin in Ang Mo Kio which planned to extend their existing structure. This, on top of the almost saturated 'Islamic fund-raising circle' constituting other mosques and madrasahs throughout Singapore. Through sheer hard work of the volunteers, and contributions from the Muslim community not only within the Hougang/Serangoon/Ang Mo Kio areas but islandwide, the construction was finally initiated in March 1998. On June 11, 1999, Masjid Al- Istiqamah was declared waqf (vested property) and began its operation as a full-fledged mosque. On June 17, 2000, Masjid Al-Istiqamah was inaugurated by the then Permanent Secretary for Education Mr Mohamed Maidin Packer Mohd.  Operations  Ever since it began operation, Masjid Al-Istiqamah has never locked its gates. Its open policy allows for 24/7 accessibility for the public to its main prayer hall and amenities, a rarity for the typical new generation mosque with valuable assets to look after. In September 2000, with the official appointment of its Mosque Manager, it became the first mosque in Singapore to have its office administration 'fully accommodated' for the congregation with its opening hours from 8:30 to 22:30 including Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. Its office closes only on the first two days of Shawwal, for obvious reasons.

This high melting-point solid is a principal compound of plutonium. It can vary in color from yellow to olive green, depending on the particle size, temperature and method of production. Structure PuO2 crystallizes in the fluorite motif, with the Pu4+ centers organized in a face-centered cubic array and oxide ions occupying tetrahedral holes. PuO2 owes its utility as a nuclear fuel to the fact that vacancies in the octahedral holes allows room for fission products. In nuclear fission, one atom of plutonium splits into two. The vacancy of the octahedral holes provides room for the new product and allows the PuO2 monolith to retain its structural integrity. Properties Plutonium dioxide is a stable ceramic material with an extremely low solubility in water and with a high melting point (2,744 ¬∞C). The melting point was revised upwards in 2011 by several hundred degrees, based on evidence from rapid laser melting studies which avoid contamination by any container material. Due to the radioactive alpha decay of plutonium, PuO2 is warm to the touch. As with all plutonium compounds, it is subject to control under the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty. Synthesis Plutonium metal spontaneously oxidizes to PuO2 in an atmosphere of oxygen. Plutonium dioxide is mainly produced by calcination of plutonium(IV) oxalate, Pu(C2O4)2¬∑6H2O, at 300 ¬∞C. Plutonium oxalate is obtained during the reprocessing of nuclear fuel as plutonium is dissolved in HNO3/HF. Plutonium dioxide can also be recovered from molten-salt breeder reactors by adding sodium carbonate to the fuel salt after any remaining uranium is removed from the salt as its hexafluoride. Applications A pellet of PuO2 glows from the decay of isotope plutonium-238 it contains PuO2, along with UO2, is used in MOX fuels for nuclear reactors. Plutonium-238 dioxide is used as fuel for several deep-space spacecraft such as the 'New Horizons' Pluto probe as well as in the Curiosity rover on Mars. The isotope decays by emitting Œ±-particles, which then generate heat (see radioisotope thermoelectric generator). There have been concerns that an accidental re-entry into Earth's atmosphere from orbit might lead to the break-up and/or burn-up of a spacecraft, resulting in the dispersal of the plutonium, either over a large tract of the planetary surface or within the upper atmosphere. However, although at least two spacecraft carrying PuO2 RTGs have reentered the Earth's atmosphere and burned up (Nimbus B-1 in May 1968 and the Apollo 13 Lunar Module in April 1970), the RTGs from both spacecraft survived reentry and impact intact, and no environmental contamination was noted in either instance; in any case, RTGs since the mid-1960s have been designed to remain intact in the event of reentry and impact, following the 1964 launch failure of Transit 5-BN-3 (the early-generation plutonium-metal RTG on board disintegrated upon reentry and dispersed radioactive material into the atmosphere north of Madagascar, prompting a redesign of all U.S. RTGs then in use or under development). Physicist Peter Zimmerman, following up a suggestion by Ted Taylor, demonstrated that a low-yield (1-kiloton) nuclear weapon could be made relatively easily from plutonium oxide. A plutonium-oxide bomb would have a considerably larger critical mass than one made from plutonium metal (almost three times larger, even with the oxide at maximum crystal density; if the oxide were in powder form, as is often encountered, the critical mass would be much higher still), due both to the lower density of plutonium in PuO2 compared with plutonium metal and to the added inert mass of the oxygen contained. Toxicology The behavior of plutonium oxide in the body varies with the way in which it is taken. Since it is insoluble, when ingested, a very large percentage of it will be eliminated from the body quite rapidly in body wastes.United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Fact sheet on plutonium (accessed Nov 29 2013) In particulate form, plutonium oxide at a particle size less than 10 micrometers (0.01 mm)World Nuclear Society, Plutonium (accessed Nov 29 2013) is toxic if inhaled, due to its alpha- emission.

Self-described as \\"The painter of Morocco,\\"Le Matin du Sahara et du Maghreb,(Tangier, Morocco February 15, 2002) Hamri was one of the few Moroccans to participate in the Tangier Beat scene.Obituary of Hamri from The Independent (London, October 19, 2000) He was born in 1932 in Ksar-el-Kebir in northern Morocco. His father was a ceramics artist who painted his pieces following an ancient tradition. Hamri's mother was born into the Attar family of Zahjouka musicians. His uncle was the leader of the Master Musicians of Joujouka.Clandermond, Andrew, MacCarthy Terence, Hamri the painter of Morocco , (Tangier, 2004)pp 1‚Äì3, Hamri is father to Sanaa Hamri, the first Moroccan woman to direct a Hollywood movie. Career Hamri helped the Master Musicians of Joujouka survive by bringing them to Tangier to play. In 1951, writer Paul Bowles met the 18-year-old Hamri at Tanger train station. He later met the painter Brion Gysin‚Äîinventor of The Cut-up technique‚Äîwho tutored him and introduced him to modern European painters. Gysin and Hamri had a joint exhibition in 1952. After Hamri introduced Gysin to the Zahjouka village, Gysin became a lifelong promoter of the Sufi trance master musicians who lived there. Together with Gysin, Hamri set up the \\"1001 Nights Restaurant\\" in Tangier with Hamri as cook and where Gysin employed the Master Musicians to play.Greene, Michelle, \\"The Dream at the End of the World\\", (New York, 1991), p.123, p.201 In 1958 Gysin bought out Hamri's interest in the restaurant for $10,000 but he soon lost the restaurant himself.Greene, Michelle, The Dream at the End of the World, (New York, 1991), p.201 He soon opened a new 1001 Nights in Asilah‚Äî40 km south of Tangier‚Äîwhere he first met Brian Jones and subsequently brought him to Zahjouka.Clandermond, Andrew, MacCarthy Terence, Hamri the painter of Morocco , (Tangier,2004), p.9 Meeting with Brian Jones Rolling Stones founder and multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones met Hamri when he visited Morocco in 1967. They then developed a close friendship. In 1968, Gysin and Hamri took Jones to the village to record the master musicians in the ground-breaking release Brian Jones Presents The Pipes of Pan at Joujouka, whose original cover featured a painting of Jones and The Master Musicians of Joujouka by Hamri before a 1990s redesign.Sleeve Note Brian Jones presents the Pipes of Pan at Jououka, Rolling Stones Records, 1971 In 1975, Hamri's book Tales of Joujouka, which told stories from the village, including \\"The Legend of Boujeloud\\", the half-goat/half-man creature celebrated in the annual ritual, was published by Capra Press in Santa Barbara.Hamri, Mohamed, Tales of Joujouka, (Santa Barbara, 1975) Cover of Hamri's Tales of Joujouka, Capra Press, 1975 showing Boujeloud/Pan From 1980 onwards, Hamri divided his time between Tangier and Zahjouka. After the death of Hadj Abdesalam Attar his son Bachir Attar continued his father's group's music with The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar. In a break from Morocco between 1974 and 1978 to pursue his painting career, Hamri published his Tales of Joujouka. =1990s to 2000= On his return to Morocco Hamri built a new house in Zahjouka, which became a gathering place for the musicians. Using his reputation as an artist, he invited them to shows when only he had been invited to exhibit as a painter. In 1991 he brought the group to Italy. In 1992, Hamri participated in The Here to Go Show in Dublin, Ireland. The show, a celebration of William Burroughs, Brion Gysin and the Tangier beat scene, was documented in the documentary Destroy all Rational Thought, directed by Joe Ambrose and Frank Rynne. In 1994 Hamri arranged for the Master Musicians of Joujouka to record their first CD release Joujouka Black Eyes. The recording was produced by Frank Rynne under Hamri's supervision.Campion, Chris, \\"Night Spirit Masters\\" The Wire, August 1995 Hamri had over 50 exhibitions of his paintings in Morocco, Spain, Lebanon, Canary Islands, Germany, United States, UK and Ireland during his lifetime.Clandermond, Andrew, MacCarthy Terence, Hamri the painter of Morocco , (Tangier,2004), pp 39‚Äì42.

CNA currently has commercial agreements with Reuters, AFP, ITAR-TASS, RIA NOVOSTI and MENA and cooperation agreements with ANA, SANA, XINHUA, ANSA, IRNA, PAP, APS and ATA. CNA also exchanges news with the Macedonian Press Agency (Thessaloniki), BTA, STA, KYODO and ROMPRES. The Cyprus News Agency was officially established on February 16, 1976 at the initiative of the then Director General of the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation (CyBC) Andreas Christofides, who saw the need for a national news agency for Cyprus. Previously, a private news service under the same name had been set up by Miltiades Christodoulou, in 1957. On his appointment as director of the government Press and Information Office (PIO), he handed over to journalist Christakis Katsambas. The operation closed down in 1967. With the official launching of CNA, Christofides appointed Andreas Hadjipapas, a journalist working for CyBC and correspondent for UPI and AFP in Cyprus, as chief editor of the Agency. Technical facilities were provided by the PIO, thus enabling Hadjipapas to dispatch a daily news bulletin in English to Reuters and the Non-Aligned News Agencies Pool. In 1984, CNA expanded its activities, hired journalists and other staff and secured translation and distribution of its dispatches in other languages apart from English. In 1989, the Cyprus House of Representatives approved legislation providing for the operation of the Cyprus News Agency as a \\"semi-governmental\\" news organisation with full editorial independence. Under the Act, CNA is governed by a seven-member Board of Directors comprising established media professionals. The Board includes representatives of the Cyprus Journalists Union, the Cyprus Newspaper and Magazine Publishers Association, CyBC and the PIO. In 1996, an important year in the development of CNA, news in Greek was introduced, to meet the needs of the local news media which were proliferating, especially in the electronic field and the CNA home page was created on the Internet. A landmark in CNA's history is the signing in 1996 of a cooperation agreement with the Athens News Agency (ANA), which provided CNA its first computerised editing system. At the same time, CNA sought membership in established media organisations and regional associations of news agencies. Thus, it became a member of the Alliance of Mediterranean News Agencies (AMAN), the European Alliance of Press Agencies (EAPA) and the Commonwealth Press Union (CPU). In June 1998, CNA was elected President of the Alliance of the Mediterranean News Agencies (AMAN) at the Alliance's Seventh General Assembly, held in Limassol. During its tenure as President, CNA hosted in Nicosia, in cooperation with AFP, a technical seminar for the member-agencies of the Alliance (March 1999). In June 2000, CNA was unanimously elected at the Ninth General Assembly to the post of Secretary-General of AMAN, for a three-year period and was re-elected in 2003 for a further three-year tem. In 2002, CNA introduced news in Turkish, a press release service and its own photo service offering local coverage of news events. Together with the budget for 2004, the Council of Ministers and the House of Representatives approved the re-organisation of CNA and a new organisational chart which is to be implemented fully by the end of 2005, thus allowing a further upgrading of the services offered and the operation of the Agency on a 24-hour basis. Services As a national news agency, CNA focuses its attention on events in Cyprus and on developments abroad that have some bearing on Cyprus or are of particular interest to the country. It also covers news in the region and activities of the European Union, the Council of Europe and other multilateral organisations. Coverage includes developments in the Cyprus issue and the country's accession to the EU, as well as home news, domestic politics, foreign policy, economic and business news, social issues, culture/arts and sports. CNA has correspondents or stringers in all towns of the island, as well as Brussels and Strasbourg, Athens, Turkey, London, Washington, D.C. and New York City. CNA transmits daily news items in Greek, English and Turkish to its subscribers at home and abroad. Subscribers include daily and weekly newspapers, radio and television stations, international and national press agencies, international organisations, local public and private institutions, Cyprus embassies and press offices throughout the world, foreign embassies and diplomatic missions in Cyprus, as well as Cypriot and Greek overseas communities and their media (newspapers, radio and TV) mainly in Britain, Australia, the United States of America and Canada. News items in Turkish are posted on the website for free access and sent by e-mail to the Turkish-Cypriot and Turkish media, as well as to the Turkish-Cypriot political parties. In addition to the news items distributed throughout the day, CNA also issues a Cyprus press review in Greek and a 24-hours news summary in Greek for overseas subscribers in large Cypriot and Greek communities, as well as a bulletin on activities of Cypriots abroad. Through agreements with the Athens News Agency (ANA) and the European Pressphoto Agency (EPA), CNA offers subscribers a large selection of photographs covering local and international events. CNA itself offers photographs on Cyprus events. As from 1/6/ 2002 CNA offers a Press Release Service, on a subscription basis, offering interested organisations the possibility of distributing verbatim their press releases to the media and other subscribers of the Agency. Through this service, the releases of the Press and Information Office of the Cyprus Government are distributed. The Agency is planning the introduction of other news services and multimedia services, after implementation of its new organisational chart which will allow an increase of its editorial staff and working hours. These services include news in the format of SMA, MMS, WAP and WEB.

The idea for the company came during her stay in the United States, during which time her favorite hobby after work was going to nearby bookstores. Yu had also paid careful attention to the establishment and development of Amazon.com since early 1995 when she was working on Wall Street. When she met her husband, she had the idea to start a similar online company in China. As the executive, Yu considers business issues from both an investor's and manager's perspective. Since the company's creation in 1999, Dangdang has expanded to become an online bookstore with over 6,000,000 books, as well as home goods, clothing, jewelry, cosmetics, DVDs, and movies. On July 9, 2015, almost five years after she took Dangdang public on NYSE, Peggy Yu proposed to buy out the company from shareholders at a valuation of $630 million. Peggy Yu's proposed valuation was less than half of Dangdang's IPO valuation. The proposed buyout price, $7.81 per ADS, by Peggy Yu and her husband Guoqing Li, was the lowest among all Chinese ADRs seeking to go private, even 20% lower than the company's prior 30 days average trading price, according to Bloomberg. Dangdang shareholders widely protested the proposed offer and launched a dedicated shareholders' activism website, dangdangfacts.com,dangdangfacts.com with assertions that Yu unfairly took advantages of minority shareholders.  Personal life  In addition to being a successful businesswoman, Yu is a wife and mother. She prides herself on balancing her family life, personal life and professional life and keeping them clearly separated. She and her husband have an agreement that they do not discuss anything concerning business when they are at home or after 10 pm. Yu's personal model is her grandmother. In an interview she said of her grandmother: \\"Despite painful diseases she wore a smile on her face all the time, and remained calm and brave while suffering the Cultural Revolution. Her optimism and courage has a big effect on me.\\"  References   External links  * dangdang.com Category:1965 births Category:20th-century Chinese businesswomen Category:21st-century Chinese businesswomen Category:Beijing Foreign Studies University alumni Category:Businesspeople from Chongqing Category:Businesspeople in online retailing Category:Chinese computer businesspeople Category:Chinese expatriates in the United States Category:Chinese online retailer founders Category:Chinese women chief executives Category:Chinese women company founders Category:Living people Category:New York University Stern School of Business alumni ","title":"Peggy Yu"},{"id":"2451891","text":"Eberhard Bosslet, Schrott & Sonne (Scrap Metal and Sun), 1982 Eberhard Bosslet (born 1953) is a German contemporary artist who has been producing site- specific art and architectural-related works, such as sculpture, installation, light art and painting, all indoors and outdoors, since 1979.

Soon, Charlotte finds a lover, Luis, an unsuccessful artist. Luis and Eva also have no time for sex: he must find his inspiration for art and Eva has agreed to give up her own occupation as an artist to support themselves and their 3 and 6 year old kids by working in a restaurant. The secret affair between Luis and Charlotte lasts quite a while, they decide to spend a romantic week in Venice, Italy, but accidentally Eva finds out about the affair and their destination. Eva kidnaps Nick on her trip to Venice in order to restore her marriage as well as his. During their stay in Venice, Luis becomes ill and spends the entire week in the bathroom. On their way from Munich, Germany (where the first half of the story takes place) to Venice, Eva's car breaks down somewhere in the Alps, so she, Nick, and her two children are forced to walk and hitchhike the rest of the way. Nick is allergic to children and continually sneezes but the children grow warm on him, since Eva's no-nonsense attitude forces him to spend a lot of time with them. They arrive in Venice without money, passports, credit cards, their clothes torn and burnt, on a Friday evening, which means that they have to spend the weekend without any support from the German consulate.

On Wednesday 7 June 1989, the flight crashed during approach to Paramaribo-Zanderij, killing 176 of the 187 on board. It is the deadliest aviation disaster in Suriname's history. Investigation revealed significant deficiencies in the crew's training and judgement. They knowingly attempted to land using an inappropriate navigation signal and ignored alarms warning them of an impending crash. The safety issues stemming from the incident were of such concern that the United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued safety recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Aircraft and crew The aircraft (named the Anthony Nesty in honor of the Olympic Swimmer) was a four-engined McDonnell Douglas DC-8-62 passenger jet which had first flown in 1969 as part of the air fleet of Braniff International Airways. An NTSB brief shows that while the aircraft was owned by Braniff it was involved in a minor accident in 1979 in which there were no fatalities. The aircraft was sold to Surinam Airways shortly afterwards. The official report into the crash of Flight 764 made no indication that this previous incident contributed in any way to the subsequent fatal crash. The flight crew consisted of captain Wilbert (Will) Rogers (66), first officer Glyn Tobias (34) and flight engineer Warren Rose (65). There were six flight attendants on board. History of the flight The flight departed Amsterdam Airport Schiphol as scheduled at 23:25 on 6 June. The next ten hours of the flight passed uneventfully. The crew received a final weather report and clearance for a VOR/DME (VHF omnidirectional range/Distance Measuring Equipment) approach to runway 10 but instead initiated an ILS (Instrument Landing System/Distance Measuring Equipment) landing. During the approach, the plane's No. 2 engine struck a tree at a height of approximately 25 meters above ground level. The right wing then struck another tree, causing the aircraft to roll and impact the ground inverted. Of the 9 crew and 178 passengers, none of the crew and only 11 passengers survived, leaving 176 dead. Colourful 11 A memorial in Paramaribo A memorial created by Gillaume Lo-A-Njoe A group of Surinamese football players playing professionally in the Netherlands and organized as an exhibition team known as the Colourful 11 (in Dutch Kleurrijk Elftal) were among the dead. The team was an initiative of Dutch Surinamese social worker Sonny Hasnoe who worked with underprivileged children in disadvantaged neighbourhoods in Amsterdam. Many people of Surinamese origin lived in the city's Bijlmer district and were isolated from mainstream Dutch society. Hasnoe often found that he could engage the youngsters socially if they saw positive role models that had the same background as they did. He encouraged young boys to join football clubs and noted an improvement in their behaviour when they were playing sports as it gave them an opportunity to interact with their white contemporaries and so helped speed up the process of social integration. In 1986, Sonny Hasnoe organised the first match between a star selection of Surinamese Dutch professionals and SV Robinhood, champions of the domestic Surinamese competition. The match was a great success and further contests were arranged. The Colourful 11 were to play a match in Suriname in June 1989, however a number of players were denied permission to travel by their Dutch professional clubs. Among the players who stayed back as a result were Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard, Aron Winter, Bryan Roy, Stanley Menzo, Dean Gorre, Jos Luhukay and Regi Blinker. A group of eighteen \\"second stringers\\" travelled to Suriname instead. Former Ajax players and Dutch internationals Henny Meijer and Stanley Menzo ‚Äì who ignored his club's decree and went to Suriname on his own accord ‚Äì had taken an earlier flight and were spared the fate of their teammates. =Football players killed in the crash= * Ruud Degenaar, 25, Heracles Almelo * Lloyd Doesburg, 29, AFC Ajax * Steve van Dorpel, 23, FC Volendam * Wendel Fr√§ser, 22, RBC Roosendaal * Frits Goodings, 25, FC Wageningen * Jerry Haatrecht, 28, Neerlandia, was travelling in place of his brother Winston Haatrecht who had post-season duties with his club SC Heerenveen. * Virgall Joemankhan, 20, Cercle Brugge * Andro Knel, 21, NAC Breda * Ruben Kogeldans, 22, Willem II Tilburg * Ortwin Linger, 21, HFC Haarlem, died three days after the crash as a result of his injuries * Fred Patrick, 23, PEC Zwolle * Andy Scharmin, 21, FC Twente * Elfried Veldman, 23, De Graafschap * Florian Vijent, 27, Telstar * Nick Stienstra, 34, RC Heemstede (coach) =Football players who survived= * Sigi Lens, 25, Fortuna Sittard, would never be able to play football again due to a complicated pelvic fracture. * Edu Nandlal, 25, Vitesse, suffered a partial spinal cord lesion, but eventually recovered and now walks with a limp. * Radjin de Haan, 19, Telstar, would play again, but was forced to retire early as he could not reach his former level of performance due to a fractured vertebra. In 2005, Dutch journalist Iwan Tol released his book about this lost generation of Surinamese players called: Eindbestemming Zanderij. Het vergeten verhaal van het kleurrijk elftal (). Investigation and probable cause A commission was set up by the Surinamese government to investigate the accident. The results of that investigation were: The final weather report sent to the aircraft accurately stated that there was visibility of 900 meters in dense fog, 1/4 cloud cover with a cloud base at 400 feet, and winds calm. This surprised the flight crew, because previous weather information had given visibility of 6 kilometers. As a result, despite the fact that the aircraft was cleared for a VOR/DME (VHF omnidirectional range/Distance Measuring Equipment) approach, it was an ILS/DME (Instrument Landing System/Distance Measuring Equipment) that was initiated. ILS navigational equipment is normally more accurate than VOR/DME equipment, but in this case the ILS equipment at Zanderij airport, though transmitting signals, was not suitable nor available for operational use. The investigation showed that the crewmembers were aware of this. The cockpit voice recorder captured the first officer saying, \\"I don't trust that ILS\\", but the captain chose to use it regardless. He did instruct the First Officer to tune the required navigational equipment for the functional VOR/DME approach, most likely for use as a gross error check. Because of the unreliability of the ILS signal, the aircraft descended too low, triggering several audible and visual warning signals. The crew ignored these warnings, and also descended below the minimum altitude allowed for both the VOR/DME and ILS procedures without positive visual contact with the runway. A possible reason was that they had to land soon due to a lack of fuel, until finally, the aircraft crashed at 04:27. The NTSB investigation also discovered that captain Roger's age (66 years old) was over the maximum age allowed for operating as captain on this flight. Additionally he was not properly checked and approved for operation on the aircraft type, as his most recent check had been done on a small piston twin engined aircraft instead of the DC-8. Partly due to name confusion in his check paperwork, this incorrect check went unnoticed by the airline. The probable cause paragraph from the report reads as follows: NTSB recommendations to the FAA Even though the accident was not under U.S. jurisdiction, the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board) was actively involved in the investigation because the aircraft was U.S.-registered. As a result of its findings, a number of safety recommendations were made to the FAA. These recommendations were made only to the FAA and not the government of Suriname or its bodies of investigation because the scope of the investigation was restricted by jurisdictional issues. The following recommendations were made: * Perform ramp and en route inspections of air carriers operating aircraft under 14 CFR part 129 that are registered in the United States. * Require air carriers operating into the United States under part 129 to provide the FAA with a list of the names, dates of birth, and certificate number of all captains and first officers operating airplanes into the United States. If pilots are found to have reached their 60th birthday, inform the air carrier that these pilots are not authorized to operate as either captain or copilot under the terms of the operations specifications issued in accordance with Part 129.

In a local market dominated by comics devoted to a young audience, the immediate commercial success of Diabolik revealed a niche of adult readers interested in adult and sometimes exploitive themes characterized by violence and sex references.Simone Castaldi. Drawn and Dangerous: Italian Comics of the 1970s and 1980s. University Press of Mississippi, 2010. . The heroes of fumetti neri were more anti-hero or villain than traditional heroes, and Diabolik himself was very loosely based on the French Fant√¥mas character. The subsequent main characters in these comics were all inspired by Diabolik and often had a K in their names. They included Kriminal (a more violent version of Diabolik by Magnus and Max Bunker), Satanik ( a female version of Diabolik by the same authors but with supernatural and horrific elements) and Sadik. The large success of this genre led in 1965 to public campaigns against them, and even to trials and judicial seizures. As a result, from 1966 some comics remarkably reduced violence and erotic situations, and tried to open themselves to a younger and wider audience, while others, the so-called \\"vietati ai minori\\" (\\"prohibited to minors\\") exploited their status, increasing the levels of sex, and sometimes becoming openly pornographic. Examples of these more explicit comics are Vampirissimo, Jacula, Hessa, Terror, Messalina, Maghella, Oltretomba, Lucifera, Biancaneve, Vartan, Sukia, Jolanda de Almaviva, Yra, and Frankenstein. In France, these comics were published in digest size editions by the likes of Elvifrance. In the Netherlands vast amounts of the erotic comics were published by Schorpioen, Nooitgedacht and Vrijbuiter during the 70s and 80s. Legacy It was in the scene set by the fumetti neri that fumetti d'autore/auteur comics - comics published in magazines such as linus (1965ff.), Il Sergente Kirk (July 1967 ‚Äì December 1969), Eureka (November 1967 ‚Äì November 1967), Il Mago (April 1972 ‚Äì December 1980) and Frigidaire (December 1980ff.) - found a favorable ground for development in Italy in the mid-1960s.Gino Moliterno (ed.), Encyclopedia of Contemporary Italian Culture, Routledge, 2002: \\"comics\\".

They were founded in 1970 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In the 1970s and 1980s, they produced a line of 16 and 32-bit mini-computers. Through the 1980s, MODCOMP lost market share as more powerful micro-computers became popular, and Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX and Alpha systems continued to grow. The company successfully survives today as a systems integrator. Computers Their first computer was the 16-bit MODCOMP III, introduced shortly after the company was founded. This had 15 general-purpose registers, and was initially offered with a 16-kilobyte (16,384 bytes), 18-mil magnetic core memory with an 800 ns cycle time, expandable to 128 kilobytes (131,072 bytes). The MODCOMP I followed for smaller applications, with only 3 general-purpose registers and a maximum of 64 kilobytes (65,536 bytes) of core. These machines were based on SSI and MSI TTL logic. The MODCOMP II, introduced in 1972, maintained compatibility with the Modcomp III, while using some LSI circuits.Marshall William McMurran, \\"NASA Control Computers\\" (chapter 6), section \\"MODCOMP\\", Achieving Accuracy, Xlibris, 2008; pages 161‚Äì162Modcomp Family, Modular Computer Systems Inc, undated advertising brochure; discusses the MODCOMP I, II. II/CP and IV computers. Therefore, the probable date is 1974‚Äì1975. Digitized Mar 18, 2009. The core architecture of the 16-bit machines included blocks of uncommitted opcodes and provisions for physical modularity that hint at the reasoning behind the company name. The MODCOMP IV was an upward compatible 32-bit machine with a paged memory management unit introduced in 1974. The minimum memory configuration was 32 kilobytes (32,768 bytes), expandable to 512 kilobytes (524,288 bytes), with access times of 500 to 800 nanoseconds (varying because of memory interleaving). The machine had 240 general purpose registers, addressable as 16 banks of 15 registers. The MMU contained 1024 address mapping registers, arranged as 4 page tables of 256 pages each (some of these page tables could be further subdivided if address spaces smaller than 128 kilobytes (131,072 bytes) were needed). Fields of the Program Status Doubleword were used to select the current active register bank and page table. The machine had a two-stage pipelined CPU, and a floating point unit.MODCOMP Max IV Reference Data, University of California at San Francisco, 1976; this is a third-party programmer's pocket reference card for the MODCOMP IV. In many regards, the MODCOMP IV had potential as a competitor for the VAX, although the address space per process was limited to 64K 16-bit words; 256 pages of 256 words each, from the perspective of the MMU. Beginning in 1978, the MODCOMP IV was replaced by the MODCOMP Classic; the first Classic model was the 7810. This retained compatibility with the MODCOMP IV, while offering full support for 32-bit addressing. The later 9250 and 9260 continued to support both 16-bit and 32-bit applications. Operating systems The Modular Applications eXecutive family of operating systems supported these machines. MAX I was a real-time monitor for a fixed set of processes linked into a single memory image. This met the requirements of many embedded systems. MAX II was a batch disk operating system with real-time extensions. It could be used for program development in the background while foreground processes handled real-time loads. These systems used Fixed priority pre-emptive scheduling. MAX III (for the 16-bit machines) and MAX IV (for the MODCOMP IV) allowed for multiple interactive users. In MAX III, all processes shared the one address space with swapping used to support multiple background processes, one per interactive user. The MAX IV operating system was largely compatible, while it took advantage of the new features of the MODCOMP IV to allocate one address space for each process. Demand paging was not supported, and swapping was used when the total memory demand for all processes exceeded the available physical memory. The successor to MAX IV, developed to fully exploit the MODCOMP Classic system, was called MAX 32. Applications Many of MODCOMP's early sales were for tracking and data collection from NASA space probes, and in the 1980s they provided a network of 250 MODCOMP II systems to control the Space Shuttle launch complex at Cape Canaveral as well as SET at SAIL at JSC until T-30, at which point control was handed over to a single IBM mainframe. In the 1990s MODCOMP developed a product in the UK called ViewMax, which was used to connect web-based \\"front-ends\\" to legacy systems. In 1996, MODCOMP had $36.7 million in sales, and were purchased by CSPI. MODCOMP IV computers were used for the control system of the PAVE PAWS radar system built for the United States Air Force Space Command.National Research Council, Chapter 7 ‚Äî Computers, Steering, and Beam Pointing, Radiation Intensity of the PAVE PAWS Radar System, National Academy of Sciences, 1979; page 33.

As Vice-President in charge of Programming at NBC, in 1959 he oversaw the development and launch of the network's most successful television series, Bonanza. Early years Livingston was born in the Pittsburgh suburb of McDonald, Pennsylvania on October 15, 1917. He was the youngest of three children, whose mother encouraged reading books and playing musical instruments. He had an older sister, Vera, and an older brother, Jay Livingston (1915‚Äì2001), who wrote or co-wrote many popular songs for films and television, including \\"Buttons and Bows\\", \\"Mona Lisa\\", \\"Whatever Will Be, Will Be (Que Sera, Sera)\\", as well as the popular Christmas song \\"Silver Bells\\". Alan Livingston began his career in the entertainment business leading his own college orchestra as a student at the University of Pennsylvania. After graduating from the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce with a B.S. in Economics, he moved to New York where he worked in advertising for three years. At the start of World War II, he enlisted in the army as a private and served as a second lieutenant in the infantry. After his discharge, he borrowed some money, hitched a ride on an Army plane and headed for Los Angeles, California where he obtained his first position with Capitol Records, Inc. in Hollywood as a writer/producer. Capitol Records Livingston's initial assignment was to create a children's record library for the four- year-old company, for which he created the \\"Bozo the Clown\\" character. He wrote and produced a popular series of storytelling record-album and illustrative read-along book sets beginning with the October 1946 release of \\"Bozo at the Circus.\\" His record-reader concept, which enabled children to read and follow a story in pictures while listening to it, was the first of its kind. The Bozo image was a composite design of Livingston's, derived from a variety of clown pictures and given to an artist to turn into comic-book- like illustrations. Livingston then hired Pinto Colvig to portray Bozo on the recordings. Colvig, a former circus clown, was also the original voice of Walt Disney's Pluto, Goofy, Grumpy, Sleepy and many other characters. Billy May produced the music. The series turned out to be a smash hit for Capitol, selling over eight million albums in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Successful record sales led to a variety of Bozo-related merchandise and the first television series, \\"Bozo's Circus,\\" starring Pinto Colvig on KTTV- Channel 11 (CBS) in Los Angeles in 1949. The character also became a mascot for the record company and was later nicknamed \\"Bozo the Capitol Clown.\\" Livingston wrote and produced many other children's recordings including products for Walt Disney; Walter Lantz's Woody Woodpecker; Bugs Bunny and all of the Warner Bros. characters. In the case of the latter, he wrote the 1951 pop hit \\"I Tawt I Taw A Puddy Tat\\" for Mel Blanc's Tweety Pie. There were also several record-readers featuring the popular cowboy character, Hopalong Cassidy. One of these was \\"Hopalong Cassidy and The Singing Bandit\\" in 1950, which was the first children's record set to make the Top Ten charts. Within a few years, Livingston moved on to the adult music arena and became Vice President in charge of all creative operations of the company. He signed Frank Sinatra when Sinatra was at a low point in his career. Livingston wanted Sinatra to work with arranger Nelson Riddle, however Sinatra was reluctant to do so out of his loyalty to Axel Stordahl with whom he had worked for most of his career. The first Sinatra/Stordahl recordings for Capitol failed to produce the magic Livingston and producer Voyle Gilmore were looking for, and Sinatra agreed to try a session with Billy May on April 30, 1953, but instead Livingston booked Riddle, telling Sinatra that May had to unexpectedly leave town for a live performance. The impact was immediate, producing the classic \\"I've Got the World on a String\\". However, it was \\"Young at Heart\\" that became the defining moment in Sinatra's comeback, peaking at #2 during its 22-week run on the charts in the spring of 1954. Livingston was credited as the creative force responsible for Capitol Records' growth from net sales of $6 million per year to sales in excess of $100 million per year. He was also officially credited as the inspiration for the distinctive Capitol Records Tower, completed in April 1956, noted for being the first circular office building in the world. Livingston is also responsible for what have come to be known as the \\"Livingston Butcher Covers.\\" When The Beatles released their 1966 compilation album Yesterday and Today it was initially released with a surreal Robert Whitaker cover photograph depicting the group draped in slabs of meat and dismembered doll parts. Protests from record dealers forced Capitol to immediately recall the album and re-issue it with a new cover. The original covers, in any condition, have become highly sought after collectors items. Shortly after the controversy erupted, Livingston took home a box containing both mono and stereo copies of the original \\"Butcher cover\\" albums, sealed and in pristine condition. They remained in storage at the Livingston home, untouched, for the next twenty years until Livingston's son Christopher revealed their existence when he brought several of the albums to sell at a Beatlefest convention in 1987. These Butcher covers are considered the best examples of these albums and currently command a premium price upwards of $20,000. California Productions and NBC After 10 years with Capitol, Livingston and the company sold the \\"Bozo the Clown\\" licensing rights (excluding the recordings) to Larry Harmon, one of several people hired to portray the character at promotional appearances; Livingston left the company to accept a position as President of California National Productions, Inc., the wholly owned film production subsidiary of the National Broadcasting Company. Shortly thereafter, Livingston was also named Vice President of NBC, in charge of Television Network Programming, dealing principally with all films made for the network. In this capacity, he hired David Dortort to write and produce the pilot for the series Bonanza for which Livingston's older brother, songwriter Jay Livingston, wrote the memorable theme. During this time, Alan also served on the Boards of Bob Hope Enterprises, Inc. and Joseph Mankiewicz's motion picture production company, Figaro, Inc. Return to Capitol Five years later, Capitol Records induced Livingston to return as president and, eventually, chairman of the board. He was also named to the Board of Electric and Musical Industries (EMI), a British corporation that was the largest stockholder in Capitol. Subsequently, he merged Capitol Records into Audio Devices, Inc., a magnetic tape manufacturer listed on the American Stock Exchange, and changed the name of the surviving company to Capitol Industries, Inc., of which Livingston was named president. It was during this period that he turned Capitol Records into a more rock-oriented company with such artists as The Beach Boys, Steve Miller, The Band, and others. His most noteworthy accomplishment at that time was agreeing to release the Beatles' \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" for Capitol in 1963, after having rejected all their previous singles as unsuitable for the U.S. market despite Capitol being owned by The Beatles' U.K. record company, EMI. Later ventures Livingston later sold his stock in Capitol Industries to form his own company, Mediarts, Inc., for the production of motion pictures, records and music publishing. He eventually sold his interest in that company to United Artists as a result, particularly, of its success in the record business including Don McLean, who reached the #1 position in the country with his \\"American Pie\\" single and album in 1972. Two feature motion pictures were completed during the company's operation: Downhill Racer (1969) starring Robert Redford and Gene Hackman, and Unman, Wittering and Zigo (1971) starring David Hemmings; both released by Paramount Pictures. In August 1976, Livingston joined Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation as Senior Vice President and President, Entertainment Group. He left in 1980 to accept the presidency of Atalanta Investment Company, Inc., and resigned in 1987 to produce a one-hour film for television and to form Pacific Rim Productions, Inc. Livingston also wrote a novel titled Ronnie Finkelhof, Superstar about a shy Harvard pre-law student who becomes an overnight success as a rock musician. It was published by Ballantine Books in the spring of 1988. On August 1, 1998, Livingston received his first honor for his creation of \\"Bozo the Clown\\" as the International Clown Hall of Fame in Milwaukee, Wisconsin presented him their Lifetime of Laughter Achievement Award. His first two marriages, one to actress Betty Hutton, ended in divorce. Livingston's third and final marriage was to actress Nancy Olson, whose film credits include Sunset Boulevard (1950) and The Absent-Minded Professor (1961). They resided in Beverly Hills, California. Their son, Christopher Livingston, is a movie producer, director, writer and songwriter. He also had a daughter, jewelry designer Laura Livingston Gibson, from a previous marriage. Death Livingston died after a series of mini-strokes at his home in Beverly Hills, California at the age of 91. He was survived by his wife, former actress Nancy Olson (formerly Mrs. Alan Jay Lerner), a son, Christopher Livingston; a daughter from a previous marriage, Laura Gibson; and two step daughters, Liza and Jennifer Lerner.

Latham was a follower of James Cowles Prichard, and like Prichard took ethnology to be, in the main, the part of historical philology that traced the origin of races through the genealogical relationships of languages.Robert Young, Colonial Desire: hybridity in theory, culture, and race (1996), p. 66; Google Books. He frequently lectured in this area. As a baseline he used the three-race theory of Georges Cuvier.Philip D. Curtin, The Image of Africa: British ideas and action, 1780-1850 (1973), p. 369; Google Books. Along with Prichard, however, Latham criticised Cuvier's use of the \\"Caucasian race\\" concept; and he preferred to avoid the term \\"race\\", referring instead to \\"varieties of man\\", as a reaction to the rise of polygenist theory around 1850.Bruce David Baum, The Rise and Fall of the Caucasian race: a political history of racial identity (2006), pp. 111‚Äì2; Google Books. However, he followed in 1854 by writing The Native Races of the Russian Empire. Latham moved on, though, from Prichard's assumption (now sometimes called \\"languages and nations\\"), that the historical relationships of languages matched perfectly the relationships of the groups speaking them. In 1862 he made a prominent protest against the central Asian theory of the origin of the Aryan race. He supported views which were later advocated by Theodor Benfey, Parker, Isaac Taylor, and others. The origin of the Indo- European languages was, in Latham's view, in Lithuania; and he strongly attacked Max M√ºller, proponent of the \\"Aryan theory\\", at the same time as did John Crawfurd arguing from rather different premises.Thomas R. Trautmann, Languages and Nations: the Dravidian proof in colonial Madras (2006), p. 223; Google Books. The controversy over Latham's views on Indo-European languages following his Comparative Philology (1862) did permanent damage to his scholarly reputation.George W. Stocking, Jr., Victorian Anthropology (1987), p. 58. Later life Robert Gordon Latham, photograph published 1863. Gordon Hake wrote in his memoirs of Latham's habit of pleading poverty and asking for money.Thomas Gordon Hake, Memoirs of Eighty Years (1892), p. 208; archive.org. In 1863 Latham obtained a civil list pension. In later life he was afflicted with aphasia, and died at Putney on 9 March 1888. Works In 1841 Latham produced a well-known text-book, The English Language. He devoted himself to a thorough revision of Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language, which he completed in 1870. He subsequently spent much time on a Dissertation on the Hamlet of Saxo Grammaticus and of Shakespeare. His works on the English language passed through many editions, and were regarded as authoritative till they were superseded by those of Richard Morris and Walter William Skeat.

Since the founding of the Church of Scientology in 1954 by L. Ron Hubbard, the relationship between Scientology and psychiatry has been dominated by strong opposition by the organization against the medical specialty of psychiatry, and psychology, with themes relating to this opposition occurring repeatedly throughout Scientology literature and doctrine. Scientology's views on the evils of materialism. According to the Church of Scientology, psychiatry has a long history of improper and abusive care. The group's views have been disputed, criticized and condemned by experts in the medical and scientific community and been a source of public controversy. L. Ron Hubbard had a complex and changing relationship with psychiatry; He recalled positive experiences with psychiatrists in his youth and requested psychiatric treatment in adulthood. By 1948, Hubbard claimed to volunteer in a psychiatric clinic and two years later published \\"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\\". In 1951, however, Hubbard's wife Sara Northrup Hollister reportedly consulted psychiatrists who recommended Hubbard be institutionalized; thereafter, Hubbard was increasingly hostile towards psychiatry. In 1995, Scientologist Lisa McPherson died at \\"Flag Land Base\\" after leaving a hospital where she refused psychiatric treatment. In 2003, a man with untreated schizophrenia murdered his mother after his paranoid delusions caused him to become convinced the Scientology-approved vitamins she was giving him in lieu of effective medication were poisonous. In 2005, celebrity Scientologist Tom Cruise achieved notoriety for his public opposition to psychiatry. L. Ron Hubbard and psychiatry Hubbard's beliefs and practices, drawn from a diverse set of sources, influenced numerous offshoots, splinter-groups, and new movements. L. Ron Hubbard was an American author of science fiction and fantasy stories. Hubbard reported many encounters with psychiatrists, from the age of 12 onward. During World War Two, Hubbard was hospitalized; In 1947, Hubbard requested psychiatric treatment and the following year moved with his wife to Savannah Georgia where he was reportedly associated with a psychiatric clinic. In 1950, Hubbard published Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health. In 1951, it was publicly reported that Hubbard's wife Sara had been advised by a psychiatrist that Hubbard should be institutionalized for treatment of paranoid schizophrenia. They divorced, and the following year, Hubbard founded Scientology, an Anti-Psychiatry religious movement. =Overview= Hubbard's views on psychiatry evolved over time. Hubbard spoke positively of his childhood and teen encounters with psychiatrists in the 1920 and 30s. At the age of 12, Hubbard was accompanied by Navy psychiatrist Joseph Thompson on an ocean trip from Seattle to Washington, D.C. Hubbard likewise wrote positively of teenage/young-adult encounters with D.C.-based psychiatrist William Alanson White.carolineletkeman.orgcarolineletkeman.org Some of Hubbard's later works included acknowledgements to both Thompson and White, and Hubbard would later claim to have received clinical training from Thompson and White.carolineletkeman.org In contrast, Hubbard spoke more critically of his later encounters with psychiatrists and psychiatric institutions -- Hubbard had written positively of psychiatric hospital superintendent William Alanson White, but White's successor (Winfred Overholser) was singled out for criticism.carolineletkeman.org carolineletkeman.org Hubbard likewise spoke critically of his encounters with a Washington DC institution for the treatment of schizophrenia called \\"Walnut Lodge\\" (presumably Chestnut Lodge).carolineletkeman.org During the Second World War, Hubbard was hospitalized at Oak Knoll Military Hospital. In 1947, Hubbard wrote a letter to the VA requesting psychiatric treatment.Hubbard, L. Ron, letter to Veterans Administration, October 15, 1947; quoted in Miller, p. 137 The following year, Hubbard and his wife Sara moved to Savannah, Georgia, where Hubbard would later recall having been associated with a charity mental health clinic. According to Hubbard, he worked as a volunteer helping to treat charity patients during his time in Savannah. While in Savannah, Hubbard began working on a \\"book of psychology\\" about \\"the cause and cure of nervous tension\\"; the next year, he published Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health.Miller, p. 144 In 1951, Hubbard's wife Sara reportedly consulted a psychiatrist who recommended Hubbard be institutionalized. Hubbard initially responded by kidnapping Sara. Thereafter, he took their daughter and fled to Havana. After Sara went public with her story, Hubbard returned her daughter. In his final known encounter with a psychiatrist, Hubbard consulted a practitioner in order to rebut public claims of his own mental illness. Thereafter, Hubbard was increasingly hostile towards psychiatry. In the 50s, Hubbard sought to identify \\"Subversive\\" psychiatrists or other \\"Potential Subversives\\". By the early 70s, Hubbard wrote of having redefined the word \\"psychiatrist\\" to mean \\"an antisocial enemy of the people\\". L. Ron Hubbard, HCOPL (5 October 71) Propaganda by Redefinition of Words. =Hubbard's early encounters with psychiatry= Joseph Thompson, 1917 Hubbard claimed to have personal encounters with several named psychiatrists beginning in his childhood. Some, like Thompson and White, would later be remembered favorably -- Hubbard explicitly cited both as sources for his work. Others, such as Overholser and Center, were the subject of scorn. Joseph Cheesman Thompson In 1923, Navy medical doctor and psychoanalyst, Joseph \\"Snake\\" Thompson reportedly accompanied then-12-year-old L. Ron Hubbard from Seattle to Washington, D.C. According to a recording of Hubbard sharing anecdotes from his life, he considered Thompson to be a \\"very great man\\" who sparked Hubbard's interest in \\"the human mind\\". Hubbard said that Thompson told him, \\"If it's not true for you, it's not true.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laGfzYjotbs Thompson died in 1943, seven years before the publication of Dianetics. Thompson was included in the Acknowledgements section of 1951's Science of Survival, as was William A. White. William Alanson White The Center Building at St. Elizabeths, one of the oldest on the campus, as it appeared in the early 20th century William Alanson White was an American neurologist and psychiatrist who served as superintendent of St. Elizabeths Hospital. A letter from the Hubbard Association of Scientologists International to the FBI, dated June 12, 1954, claims that Hubbard was trained by both Joseph Thompson and William Alanson White. In a lecture, Hubbard described consulting White about a theoretical calculation of human memory capacity, apparently during Hubbard's university days. White died in 1937, thirteen years before the publication of Dianetics. For two years in the 1920s, White opened the doors of St. Elizabeths to Alfred Korzybski, enabling Korzybski to directly study mental illness, research that contributed heavily to Korzybski's 1933 Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics. Hubbard cited the relationship between Korzybski and White in his lectures. White was included in the Acknowledgements section of 1951's Science of Survival, as was Joseph Thompson. \\"Walnut Lodge\\" Hand coloured photographic postcard of Chestnut Lodge Sanitorium postmarked 1909 For much of the 1920s and 30s, L. Ron Hubbard lived in Washington D.C..1922-1927,1929-1932 In a 1952 lecture, Hubbard recalls his interaction with staff and patients at a facility specializing in schizophrenia which he calls \\"Walnut Lodge\\" (presumably Chestnut Lodge): Hubbard would return to \\"Walnut Lodge\\" in future writings. A 1970 bulletin states that \\"$2,000 a month for board only is the price at Walnut Lodge in Washington DC, an average place.\\"\\"The Psychiatrist At Work\\" In his work Mission Earth, Hubbard writes \\"Arginal P. Pauper was today committed to Walnut Lodge Nut House\\". =Hubbard as patient= Naval Hospital, Oak Knoll circa 1946 During World War Two, Hubbard was hospitalized at California military hospital. After his release, he wrote to the Veterans Administration to request further treatment; Thereafter he and his wife moved to Savannah Georgia where he was reportedly associated with a charity mental health clinic. Oak Knoll Military Hospital In 1945, Hubbard was a patient at Oak Knoll Military Hospital. Hubbard's estranged son, Ron DeWolf, would later state that Hubbard received psychiatric treatment during his hospitalization. Hubbard would later cite his time with psychiatric patients at Oak Knoll \\"using a park bench as a consulting room\\" as a major influence on his development of Dianetics. Request for psychiatric treatment After his discharge, Hubbard sought out psychiatric help to treat his \\"long periods of moroseness and suicidal inclinations\\" but reported that he could not afford it. A letter dated October 15, 1947 which Hubbard wrote to the Veterans Administration (VA) begins: \\"This is a request for treatment\\". The letter continues: The following year, Hubbard and his wife moved to Savannah, Georgia where he was associated with a charity psychiatric clinic. =Hubbard as wouldbe psychologist= After his arrival in Savannah, Hubbard began to describe himself as mental health practitioner, ultimately authoring Dianetics.  Savannah, Georgia psychiatric clinic  In 1948, Hubbard and his second wife Sara moved from California to Savannah, Georgia, where he would later claim to have \\"worked\\" as a \\"volunteer\\" in the psychiatric clinic, where he claimed he \\"processed an awful lot of Negroes\\".PDC43 Hubbard later wrote of having observed a \\"Dr. Center\\"Abraham Hyman Center per Biographical Directory of Fellows & Members of the American Psychiatric Association, 1950 in Savannah: Dianetics In January 1949, Hubbard wrote that he was working on a \\"book of psychology\\" about \\"the cause and cure of nervous tension\\", which he was going to call The Dark Sword, Excalibur or Science of the Mind.Miller, p. 144 In April 1949, Hubbard wrote from Savannah to inform the Gerontological Society at Baltimore City Hospital that he was preparing a paper entitled Certain Discoveries and Researches Leading to the Removal of Early Traumatic Experiences Including Attempted Abortion, Birth Shock and Infant Illnesses and Accidents with an Examination of their Effects Physiological and Psychological and their Potential Influence on Longevity on the Adult Individual with an Account of the Techniques Evolved and Employed.\\"Letters from the Birth of Dianetics - L. Ron Hubbard - The Dianetics Letters\\", Church of Scientology International. The Society apparently declined involvement. He also wrote to the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association.\\"Ron the Philosopher: The Birth of Dianetics\\", Church of Scientology International These letters, and their responses, have not been published, though Hubbard later said that they had been negative. Hubbard later wrote, \\"In 1948 I wrote a thesis on an elementary technique of application and submitted it to the medical and psychiatric professions for their use or consideration. The data was not utilized.\\"Tech Bulletins preface 6 February 1952 In December 1949, Hubbard composed a letter to publisher John Campbell in which he provided an article entitled \\"A Criticism of Dianetics\\" to be published under the pen name Irving R. Kutzman, M.D. (ostensibly an opponent of Dianetic auditing). In his letter to Campbell, Hubbard described synthesizing the opinions of multiple doctors: The following year, Hubbard authored Dianetics: the Modern Science of Mental Health, a handbook for \\"the psychiatrist, psycho-analyst and intelligent layman\\". By September 1950, the American Psychological Association's governing body unanimously adopted a resolution advising its members against using Hubbard's techniques with their patients and leading psychologists spoke out against Dianetics. Thereafter, Hubbard was critical of psychiatry. Winfred Overholser was superintendent of St. Elizabeths Hospital after 1937. By 1950, he was president of the American Psychiatric Association. In a 1953 lecture, Hubbard claimed: In 1972, Hubbard recalled: In another lecture, Hubbard claimed he gave a speech in which he hypnotized the staff of St. Elizabeth's. In late 1950, Hubbard criticized mainstream psychiatry but still wrote positively of Sigmund Freud as a fellow persecuted trailblazer, arguing that \\"to talk of the faults of Freud, as do those who practice psychoanalysis today, is ungenerous. This great pioneer, against the violent objections of medical doctors and the psychiatrists of his day, ventured to put forth the theory that memory was connected with present time behavior\\"Technical Bulletin vol I The Analytic Mind Hubbard elaborated: \\"Freud was so thoroughly shunned by neurologists of his day and medicine ever since, that only his great literary skill brought his work as far as it has come.\\" As late as 1955, Hubbard still identified himself with mental health professions, describing himself as \\"a writer, a scientist, and a psychologist\\". =Attempted institutionalization and aftermath= Hubbard's wife Sara in 1951. In 1951, Hubbard's wife Sara sought advice from a psychiatrist who recommend Hubbard be institutionalized. Upon learning of the plan, Hubbard initially kidnapped Sara; After her release, Hubbard fled to Havana with their young daughter. Hubbard then underwent a public divorce in which his wife publicly alleged that Hubbard had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Upon his return to the US, Hubbard consulted with a psychiatrist to rebut public claims of his mental illness. Sara consults psychiatrist In 1951, Hubbard's wife Sara went to a psychiatrist to obtain advice about his increasingly violent and irrational behaviour, and was told that he probably needed to be institutionalized and that she was in serious danger. She gave Hubbard an ultimatum: get treatment or she would leave with the baby. He was furious and threatened to kill their daughter Alexis rather than let Northrup care for her. Sara later recalled: \\"He didn't want her to be brought up by me because I was in league with the doctors. He thought I had thrown in with the psychiatrists, with the devils.\\"Wright, p. 71 In a letter to the Attorney General dated May 1951, Hubbard claims that on \\"Feb. 25 she [Sara] flew to San Francisco and my general managers Jack Maloney in New Jersey received a phone call from her and Miles Hollister and a psychiatrist named Meyer Zelig in San Francisco that I had gone insane and that they needed money to incarcerate me quickly.\\"scientology-research.org Two decades later, in 1972, Hubbard would write to followers: Hubbard kidnaps wife; daughter On the night of February 24, 1951, Hubbard allegedly took daughter Alexis while Sara was at a movie theater. A few hours later, he returned with two of his Dianetics Foundation staff and told Sara, who was now back at her apartment: \\"We have Alexis and you'll never see her alive unless you come with us.\\"Wright, p. 72 She was bundled into the back of a car and driven to San Bernardino, California, where Hubbard attempted to find a doctor to examine his wife and declare her insane. His search was unsuccessful and he released her at Yuma Airport across the state line in Arizona. He promised that he would tell her where Alexis was if she signed a piece of paper saying that she had gone with him voluntarily. She agreed but Hubbard reneged on the deal and flew to Chicago, where he found a psychologist who wrote a favorable report about his mental condition to refute Northrup's accusations.Atack, p. 117 Rather than telling Northrup where Alexis was, he called her and said that \\"he had cut [Alexis] into little pieces and dropped the pieces in a river and that he had seen little arms and legs floating down the river and it was my fault, I'd done it because I'd left him.\\" From March to May 1951, Hubbard fled to Havana with his infant daughter. According to his estranged son Ronald DeWolf, Hubbard was under psychiatric care at this time. Public allegation of Hubbard having 'paranoid schizophrenia' After her release, Sara filed for divorce, charging Hubbard with causing her \\"extreme cruelty, great mental anguish and physical suffering\\". Her allegations produced more lurid headlines: not only was Hubbard accused of bigamy and kidnapping, but she had been subjected to \\"systematic torture, including loss of sleep, beatings, and strangulations and scientific experiments\\". Because of his \\"crazy misconduct\\" she was in \\"hourly fear of both the life of herself and of her infant daughter, who she has not seen for two months\\". On April 23, 1951, it was publicly reported that Sara had consulted doctors who \\"concluded that said Hubbard was hopelessly insane, and crazy, and that there was no hope for said Hubbard, or any reason for her to endure further; that competent medical advisers recommended that said Hubbard be committed to a private sanatorium for psychiatric observation and treatment of a mental ailment known as paranoid schizophrenia.\\"Miller, p. 184 The San Francisco Chronicle coverage used the headline \\"Ron Hubbard Insane, Says His Wife\\".lermanet.com Hubbard's lover, Barbara Klowden, recorded in her journal: > He [Hubbard] talked about what he was going to do to psychiatrists. How he > brought psychotic into present time in psychiatrists office and how that > psychiatrist said to him \\"If you think you've cured this woman you're crazy. > If you claim to cure people by doing that, if you're not careful, we'll lock > you up.\\" He laughed and laughed. Then, tearing indignantly at chicken leg, > he said \\"They all came to me and said I was a psychotic. Hah. They called me > a paranoid. Can you imagine?\\" My blood ran cold as he was saying that and it > was all I could do to keep from weeping. Wouldn't it tear your heart out > coming from the one you love when you knew all the time was a psychotic and > a paranoid?cs.cmu.edu =Psychiatry as evil= In 1955, Hubbard wrote that \\"nearly all the backlash in society against Dianetics and Scientology has a common source ‚Äî the psychiatrist-psychologist-psychoanalyst clique\\". In a letter addressed to the FBI dated July 11, Hubbard reports having been the victim of an \\"attack made by psychiatrists using evidently Communist connected personnel\\". In 1956, Hubbard wrote an article entitled \\"A Critique of Psychoanalysis\\" which embodies Hubbard's harder stance. Writes Hubbard: \\"Now and then it becomes necessary to eradicate from a new subject things which it has inherited from an old. And only because this has become necessary am I persuaded to tread upon the toes of the \\"grandfather\\" to Dianetics and Scientology.\\" In the essay, Hubbard admits that from \\"the earliest beginnings of Dianetics it is possible to trace a considerable psychoanalytic influence.\\" Hubbard makes a distinction between Dianetics and Scientology writing that \\"Scientology, unlike Dianetics, is not a psychotherapy. It is therefore from the dominance of Scientology rather than from the viewpoint of Dianetics that one can understand the failings of psychoanalysis, its dangers and the reasons why it did not produce what it should have produced.\\" > We discover psychoanalysis to have been superseded by tyrannous sadism, > practiced by unprincipled men, themselves evidently in the last stages of > dementia. This, then, is the end of the trail for psychoanalysis‚Äîa world of > failure and brutality. Today men who call themselves analysts are merrily > sawing out patients‚Äô brains, shocking them with murderous drugs, striking > them with high voltages, burying them underneath mounds of ice, placing them > in restraints, ‚Äústerilizing‚Äù them sexually and generally conducting > themselves much as their patients would were they given the chance. It is up > to us to realize, then, that psychoanalysis in its pure practice is dead the > moment the spirit of humanity in which Freud developed the work is betrayed > by the handing over of a patient to the merciless misconduct which passes > today for treatment. In 1957, Hubbard founded the \\"National Academy of American Psychology\\" which sought to issue a \\"loyalty oath\\" to psychologists and psychiatrists. Those who opposed the oath were to be labelled \\"Subversive\\" psychiatrists, while those who merely refused to sign the oath would be labelled \\"Potentially Subversive\\". In 1958, Hubbard wrote that \\"Destroy is the same as help to a psychiatrist\\".\\"How we work on the third dynamic\\", Technical Bulletins Vol 3 p252 His 1958 writings cited \\"Psychiatry: The Greatest Flub of the Russian Civilization\\" by Tom Esterbrook ;\\"Theory of Auditing\\" Tech Bulletin Vol 3 p312 Hubbard's son would later reveal that Tom Eastebrook was one of Hubbard's many pen-names. In 1966 Hubbard declared all-out war on psychiatry, telling Scientologists that \\"We want at least one bad mark on every psychiatrist in England, a murder, an assault, or a rape or more than one.\\" He committed the Church of Scientology to the goal of eradicating psychiatry in 1969, announcing that \\"Our war has been forced to become 'To take over absolutely the field of mental healing on this planet in all forms.'\\" By 1967, Hubbard claimed that psychiatrists were behind a worldwide conspiracy to attack Scientology and create a \\"world government\\" run by psychiatrists on behalf of the USSR: > Our enemies are less than twelve men. They are members of the Bank of > England and other higher financial circles. They own and control newspaper > chains and they, oddly enough, run all the mental health groups in the world > that had sprung up [‚Ä¶]. Their apparent programme was to use mental health, > which is to say psychiatric electric shock and pre-frontal lobotomy, to > remove from their path any political dissenters [‚Ä¶]. These fellows have > gotten nearly every government in the world to owe them considerable > quantities of money through various chicaneries and they control, of course, > income tax, government finance ‚Äî Wilson, for instance, the current Premier > of England, is totally involved with these fellows and talks about nothing > else actually. Ron's Journal '67 (RJ67). Referring to psychiatrists as \\"psychs\\", Hubbard wrote of psychiatrists as denying human spirituality and peddling fake cures. He taught that psychiatrists were themselves deeply unethical individuals, committing \\"extortion, mayhem and murder. Our files are full of evidence on them.\\" Hubbard's efforts to cast the field of psychiatry as the source of all of humanity's problems are exemplified in a policy letter written in 1971, in which he attempted to redefine the word \\"psychiatrist\\" to mean \\"an antisocial enemy of the people\\": > Psychiatry and psychiatrist are easily redefined to mean 'an antisocial > enemy of the people.' This takes the kill-crazy psychiatrist off the > preferred list of professions. This is a good use of the technique as for a > century the psychiatrist has been setting an all-time record for inhumanity > to Man. L. Ron Hubbard, HCOPL (5 October 71) Propaganda by Redefinition of > Words. Anti-psychiatric themes also appear in some of Hubbard's later fictional works. In Hubbard's ten-volume series Mission Earth, various characters debate the methods and validity of psychology. In his novel Battlefield Earth, the evil Catrists (a pun on psychiatrists), are described as a group of charlatans claiming to be mental health experts. The Church of Scientology and psychiatry Scientologists often hold anti-psychiatry demonstrations A 1969 book, Believe What You Like, described an attempt by Scientologists to secretly infiltrate the National Association of Mental Health in Britain and turn official policy against mental health treatment. Though they were expelled from the organization after their identity and mission were revealed, the Church of Scientology then filed a number of suits against the NAMH. When Operation Snow White, a Church of Scientology campaign to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder L. Ron Hubbard, was revealed in 1980, it came to light that Scientology agents of the Guardian's Office had also conducted a similar campaign against the World Federation for Mental Health and the National Association of Mental Health.Beresford, David. \\"Snow White's dirty tricks\\", The Guardian, 1980-02-07. Scientology's views are expressed by its president in the following quote: > What the Church opposes are brutal, inhumane psychiatric treatments. It does > so for three principal reasons: 1) procedures such as electro-shock, drugs > and lobotomy injure, maim and destroy people in the guise of help; 2) > psychiatry is not a science and has no proven methods to justify the > billions of dollars of government funds that are poured into it; and 3) > psychiatric theories that man is a mere animal have been used to > rationalize, for example, the wholesale slaughter of human beings in World > Wars I and II. An October 2006 article in the Evening Standard underlines the strong opposition of Scientology toward the psychiatric profession: > Up front, David Miscavige is dramatically ‚Äî and somewhat bizarrely ‚Äî > attacking psychiatrists, his words backed by clips from a Scientology- > produced DVD are broadcast on four giant high-definition TV screens and > sensationally called: Psychiatry: an industry of death [...]. 'A woman is > safer in a park at midnight than on a psychiatrist's couch', booms > Miscavige, backed by savage graphics of psychiatrists ‚Äî or 'psychs' as he > calls them ‚Äî being machine-gunned out of existence. Warning sign at Psychiatry: An Industry of Death, a Scientology-run museum in Los Angeles The group says that they are near victory in their war against psychiatry. In their treatise Those Who Oppose Scientology, it is stated: > Today, there are 500 Dianeticists and Scientologists to every psychiatrist > [‚Ä¶] while Scientology is more visible than ever, with churches dotting every > continent on Earth and millions of parishioners around the world, one is > hard pressed to find even a single psychiatrist with a shingle on his door. > Scientology page on why the world's governments oppose the church. Scientology claims a worldwide membership of more than 8 million, the total of people who have taken the Scientology introductory course. The Church of Scientology claims 3.5 million members in the United States, though an independent survey has found the number of people in the United States would state their religion as 'Scientology' is close to 55,000.Kosmin, Barry A. et al. American Religious Identification Survey By comparison, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association, which are composed of psychiatrists and psychologists, have 38,000 and 148,000 members respectively. Mental health care professionals are not concerned that the public will take Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) materials seriously, because of the organization's connection with the church; however, they argue that these materials can have a harmful impact when quoted without attribution. Except for court trials and media publications and public rallies, published materials have received little notice outside of Scientology and CCHR; of reviews available, few are positive. Psychology professor Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi's short review of Psychiatrists: The Men Behind Hitler states: > Scientology has attracted much attention through its propaganda effort > against what it calls psychiatry. This has involved great expense and > organizational effort, carried out through a variety of fronts. If the book > Psychiatrists: The Men Behind Hitler (Roder, Kubillus, & Burwell, 1995) is a > representative example, and I believe it is, it proves decisively that the > campaign is rooted in total paranoia and pathetic ignorance. Reading this > book, and I will urge you not to waste too much time doing it, makes clear > that the authors simply have no idea what psychiatry is. The American Psychiatric Association's Lynn Schultz-Writsel adds: > We have not responded in any way, shape or form. There has not been a hue > and cry from members to respond. And anyway, the publication speaks for > itself. Michael Burke, the president of the Kansas Psychiatric Association, said regarding Scientology, \\"They aren't really able to support their position with any scientific data, which they tend to ignore. ‚Ä¶ the public seems to be able to look right past the Scientology hoopla.\\" The commercial motivation of Scientology in questioning psychiatry, with their alternative practice, dianetics, has been questioned by Peter W. Huber. According to Susan Raine in Scientology in Popular Culture (2017), The Church of Scientology's programs against psychiatry \\"complicates the movement's quest for religious legitimacy.\\" This is because of \\"the way in which Hubbard tried to replace psychiatry, psychology and other forms of counseling and therapy with Scientology.\\" =Legal waivers= Following legal actions involving the Church of Scientology's relationship with its members, it has become standard practice within the group for members to sign lengthy legal contracts and waivers before engaging in Scientology services. In 2003, a series of media reports examined the legal contracts required by Scientology, which require that, among other things, Scientology followers deny any and all psychiatric care that their doctors may prescribe to them: > I do not believe in or subscribe to psychiatric labels for individuals. It > is my strongly held religious belief that all mental problems are spiritual > in nature and that there is no such thing as a mentally incompetent person ‚Äî > only those suffering from spiritual upset of one kind or another dramatized > by an individual. I reject all psychiatric labels and intend for this > Contract to clearly memorialize my desire to be helped exclusively through > religious, spiritual means and not through any form of psychiatric > treatment, specifically including involuntary commitment based on so-called > lack of competence. Under no circumstances, at any time, do I wish to be > denied my right to care from members of my religion to the exclusion of > psychiatric care or psychiatric directed care, regardless of what any > psychiatrist, medical person, designated member of the state or family > member may assert supposedly on my behalf. =Citizens Commission on Human Rights= The Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), an institution set up by Scientology and Thomas Szasz, also claims that the real nature of psychiatry is that of human rights abuse. In 1966 Hubbard declared all-out war on psychiatry, telling Scientologists that \\"We want at least one bad mark on every psychiatrist in England, a murder, an assault, or a rape or more than one.\\" He committed the Church of Scientology to the goal of eradicating psychiatry in 1969, announcing that \\"Our war has been forced to become 'To take over absolutely the field of mental healing on this planet in all forms.'\\" Not coincidentally, the Church of Scientology founded the Citizens Commission on Human Rights that same year as its primary vehicle for attacking psychiatry. CCHR still quotes Hubbard's above-cited statement that all psychiatrists are criminals: \\"There is not one institutional psychiatrist alive who, by ordinary criminal law, could not be arraigned and convicted of extortion, mayhem and murder. Our files are full of evidence on them.\\" CCHR has conducted campaigns against Prozac, against electroconvulsive therapy, against Ritalin (and the existence of ADHD) and against various health legislations. CCHR has also opened a permanent museum, \\"Psychiatry: An Industry of Death\\", in Hollywood. =Tom Cruise= Actor Tom Cruise, a vocal critic of psychiatry Tom Cruise has been highly vocal in attacking the use of psychiatric medication, gaining particular attention for becoming extremely animated on the subject during an interview on Today on June 25, 2005. His position has attracted considerable criticism from psychiatrists and other physicians (American Psychiatric Association and National Mental Health Association), and individuals suffering from depression. In January 2004, Cruise made the controversial statement \\"I think psychiatry should be outlawed.\\" Further controversy erupted in 2005 after he openly criticized actress Brooke Shields for using the drug Paxil (paroxetine), an anti-depressant to which Shields attributes her recovery from postpartum depression after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. Cruise asserted that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance and that psychiatry is a form of pseudoscience. Shields responded that Cruise \\"should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them\\". This led to a heated argument between Matt Lauer and Cruise on NBC's Today on June 24, 2005. Medical authorities view Cruise's comments as furthering the social stigma of mental illness. Shields herself called Cruise's comments \\"a disservice to mothers everywhere.\\" In late August 2006, Cruise apologized in person to Shields for his comments. Scientology is well known for its opposition to mainstream psychiatry and the psychoactive drugs which are routinely prescribed for treatment. It was reported that Cruise's anti- psychiatry actions led to a rift with director Steven Spielberg. Spielberg had reportedly mentioned in Cruise's presence the name of a doctor friend who prescribed psychiatric medication. Shortly thereafter, the doctor's office was picketed by Scientologists, reportedly angering Spielberg. =Books by Scientologists= Bruce Wiseman from CCHR published the book Psychiatry: The Ultimate Betrayal (Scientology's Freedom Publications, 1995), in which he portrays psychiatry as creating Adolf Hitler. The German Scientologists Thomas Roder and Volker Kubillus wrote the book Psychiatrists: the Men Behind Hitler (also published by Scientology's Freedom Publications, 1995‚Äì2001), that advances a conspiracy theory of all-powerful psychiatrists to overwhelm the world. =Death of Lisa McPherson= In 1994, Scientologist Lisa McPherson Police interview with Fannie McPherson, Lisa's mother moved from Dallas, Texas, to Clearwater, Florida, with her employer, AMC Publishing, which was at that time owned by Bennetta Slaughter and operated and staffed primarily by Scientologists. During June 1995, the church placed McPherson in an \\"introspection rundown\\" due to perceived mental instability. Lisa completed the rundown, and she attested to the state of Clear in September. On November 18, 1995, McPherson was involved in a minor car accident. Paramedics initially left her alone because she was ambulatory, but after she began to remove her clothes, the paramedics decided to take her to the hospital. She remarked to the paramedics that she had taken off her clothes in hopes of obtaining counseling. Hospital staff agreed that she was unharmed, but recommended keeping her overnight for observation. Following intervention by fellow Scientologists, McPherson refused psychiatric observation or admission at the hospital and checked herself out after a short evaluation. Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Judge Frank Quesada concluded: McPherson was then taken to the Flag Land Base for \\"rest and relaxation\\" according to the Church of Scientology,Tobin, Thomas C. (November 14, 1998) Scientology charged in member's deathSt. Petersburg Times but sworn statements demonstrate that McPherson was brought there for another introspection rundown. Mark McGarry, an attorney with the Florida Office of the State Attorney, characterized McPherson's stay at the Flag Land Base as an \\"isolation watch\\": The church accommodated McPherson in a cabana and kept a \\"24 hours' watch\\" over her. Detailed logs were kept on McPherson's day-to-day care. These logs were handwritten on plain white paper. Most of these logs were kept but the logs for the last three days were summarized from the originals and the originals shredded. Brian J. Anderson, the then Commanding Officer of the Church's Office of Special Affairs (OSA) in Clearwater, said in his sworn statement:Lisa McPherson Files ‚Äì Sworn Statement of Brian J. Anderson pg 85 McPherson's \\"care logs\\" narrate the last seventeen days of her life: she was incoherent and sometimes violent, her nails were cut so she would not scratch herself or the staff, she bruised her fists and feet while hitting the wall. She had trouble sleeping and was being given natural supplements and the drug chloral hydrate to help her sleep. A Church staffer noted that McPherson \\"looked ill like measles or chicken pox on her face.\\" On repeated occasions she refused food and protein shakes that the staff offered. On November 26 and 30 and December 3 to 4, the staff attempted to force feed her, noting that she spat the food out. She was noted to be very weak, not standing up nor on some days moving at all. Scientologists who questioned this handling were told to \\"butt out\\".Scientology's new tack, St. Petersburg Times, November 20, 1998 On December 5, 1995, the Church staffers contacted David Minkoff, a Scientologist medical doctor who twice prescribed McPherson Valium and chloral hydrate without examining her. They requested for him to prescribe an antibiotic to McPherson because she seemed to have an infection. Minkoff refused and stated that McPherson should be taken to a hospital and he needed to see her before prescribing anything. They objected, expressing fear that McPherson would be put under psychiatric care. Dr. Janice Johnson, a senior medical officer at Flag Land Base who was assigned to care for McPherson, stated that McPherson had been gasping and had labored breathing while en route. However they passed a total of four hospitals along the way to their ultimate destination. When they arrived at Minkoff's hospital 45 minutes north of Clearwater, McPherson exhibited no vital signs. Hospital staff attempted to resuscitate her for 20 minutes before declaring her dead.Lisa McPherson Memorial Page: Killed by the Church of ScientologyLISA McPHERSON.com (documentation of civil suit)Fort Harrison Hotel ‚Äî Room 174: Death of scientologist Lisa McPherson (Why Are They Dead)LisaFiles.com The Clearwater Police Department Investigation into Lisa McPherson's DeathState takes middle road against Scientology, Thomas C. Tobin, St. Petersburg Times, November 23, 1998When can a church be accused of a crime?, HOWARD TROXLER, St. Petersburg Times, December 8, 1999 =Jeremy Perkins= On March 13, 2003, Scientologist Jeremy Perkins killed his mother, Elli, by stabbing her 77 times. Jeremy, previously diagnosed with schizophrenia, never received treatment after previous incidents with violence and hallucinations. His mother, active in the Buffalo Church of Scientology, felt that vitamins and Scientology routines were better than psychological counseling and anti-psychotic medication. =Linda Waliki= On July 5, 2007, a 25-year-old Australian woman, Linda Waliki, killed her 52-year-old father Michael, 15-year-old sister Kathryn, and injured her mother Sue with a knife. Her name was released in the print edition of the Sydney Morning Herald, on July 7, 2007. It was previously unreleased due to one of the victims being under age. She was diagnosed with a psychiatric illness, but her parents denied her continued psychiatric treatment due to their Scientology beliefs. Instead they replaced this medication with one specially imported from Scientologists in the United States. =Relations with anti-psychiatry movement= The Citizens Commission on Human Rights was co-founded by anti- psychiatrist Thomas Szasz and the Church of Scientology in 1969. Some anti- psychiatry websites and psychiatric survivors groups have sought to distance themselves from Scientology and the CCHR. In particular, the organisation Mind Freedom has specifically made public statements to emphasise that it is not connected with either CCHR or the Church of Scientology. Despite sharing notable anti-psychiatry views on some issues with the secular critics, Scientology doctrine does differ in some respects. Scientology has promoted psychiatry-related conspiracy theories, including that psychiatrists were behind the Yugoslav Wars and that September 11 was caused by psychiatrists.Hubbard Communications Office Bulletin August 26, 1982, \\"Pain and Sex\\". Cited in , p. 288. \\" are the sole cause of decline in this universe ...\\" Scientologists are religiously committed never to take psychiatric drugs and to reject psychology outright. The socio-political roots of the movements have different origins. Advocates of the anti-psychiatric world view such as David Cooper, R. D. Laing and Michel Foucault had ties with the political left of the 1960s; Thomas Szasz, with the civil libertarians of the right, as well as an outspoken atheist. Many advocates of the anti-psychiatry movement have stated that they consider the idea of \\"mental illness\\" as a convenient and inaccurate label assigned by society rather than an objective biomedical state, rejecting psychiatric terms such as schizophrenia which they may see as stigmatizing. By contrast, Hubbard referred to \\"schizophrenics\\" in his writings on Scientology theory, and developed the emotional tone scale to, in part, gauge the health of a person's mental state. Furthermore, in his Science of Survival Hubbard suggested putting people very low on the scale into quarantine, a practice at odds with, for instance, the aim of the American Association for the Abolition of Involuntary Mental Hospitalization: an organization co-founded by Szasz to end involuntary commitment.

He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, and was subsequently made a Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford. He served as canon of Christ Church, Oxford, and Principal of King's College, London, from 1844 to 1868. Early life He was the second son of Sir James Jelf, of Gloucester, and brother of William Edward Jelf. He was educated at Eton, where he began a lifelong friendship with Edward Bouverie Pusey, and in December 1816 matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. (with a second class in classics) in 1820, and M.A. in 1823, B.D. 1831, D.D. 1839. Career In 1820 he was elected fellow of Oriel College, took holy orders in 1821, and became one of the tutors in 1823 after receiving his M.A. Jelf became was master of the schools in 1824, and classical examiner in 1825. After being for a short time private tutor to Sir George Nugent, Jelf was in 1826 appointed preceptor to Prince George of Cumberland. This post he filled for thirteen years, residing much at Berlin before his pupil's father became king of Hanover (in 1837). In 1830 he was appointed canon of Christ Church, as well as married. Jelf never was prominent Tractarian, but both John Henry Newman and his friend Pusey addressed to him their letters on the interpretation of the Thirty-nine Articles, advocated in Tract 90 of the Tracts for the Times, in 1841. In 1842 he preached a sermon before the university, published as Via Media; or the Church of England our providential path between Romanism and Dissent. In 1847 he was appointed one of the six doctors to examine and report on Pusey's sermon, with the result that Pusey was suspended from preaching for two years. In 1844 Jelf succeeded Bishop John Lonsdale as principal of King's College, London, which had been founded in 1829 as in response to the theological controversies surrounding the secular University of London in 1826. There Jelf remained for twenty-four years, founding the theological department. When F. D. Maurice, the professor of theology, published his Theological Essays in 1853, Jelf condemned his views, and the council deprived Maurice of his professorship, although Maurice would be unanimously elected the Knightbridge professorship at Cambridge in 1866. Jelf also served as proctor in convocation for the chapter of Christ Church, and also sub-almoner to the queen. After resigning in 1868 the principalship of King's College, Jelf lived in the house attached to his canonry at Oxford, where he died on 19 September 1871. Works Jelf preached the Bampton lectures at Oxford in 1844, his subject being An Inquiry into the means of Grace, their mutual connection and combined use, with especial reference to the Church of England. He published a volume of Sermons Doctrinal and Practical, London, 1835; and Suggestions respecting the Neglect of the Hebrew Language as a qualification for Holy Orders, London, 1832. He also edited Bishop John Jewel's Works, Oxford, 1848, 8 vols., and left behind him a series of Lectures on the Thirty-nine Articles, which were edited after his death, 1873, by his son-in-law, the Rev. J. R. King. Legacy The Jelf medal was established at King's College London in his memory; it is awarded to the student who, in the view of the Principal, has most distinguished him or herself during their undergraduate career in the College. Family Jelf married in 1830 Emmy, countess Schlippenbach, lady-in-waiting to the Duchess of Cumberland; he had seven children, including George Edward Jelf, canon of Rochester, Sir Arthur Richard Jelf, and Colonel Richard Henry Jelf. His grandsons were Wilfrid Jelf and Henry Jelf, both first-class cricketers and military officers.

Produced by Tsuburaya Productions, Ultraman Cosmos aired from July 6, 2001 to September 27, 2002, with a total of 65 episodes, which currently makes it the longest running Ultra show to date. It was also released to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Ultraman series. In June 2002, Cosmos was taken off of television for several weeks (following the broadcast of the 49th episode) when lead actor Taiyou Sugiura was questioned in an assault and extortion case. When the case against Sugiura was dropped for lack of evidence, Cosmos was put back on the air. TBS and Tsuburaya ultimately pulled five episodes (50, 52, 54, 56, and 58) from broadcast to make up for time lost, and these episodes were later released on DVD. In April 2017, the television channel TOKU announced that they would release the series in the United States in the near future. A year later, the series was released by the channel on April 23, 2018. Story concepts Observing the increasing trend of violence that occurred in the younger generation of Japan, Tsuburaya made an Ultraman character that has a gentler nature than its predecessors. With a dominantly blue look, Tsuburaya wanted to elevate Ultraman's image as a figure of love for the environment and peace. Thus, the concept of the story is the theme of pacifism, meaning an idea which considers war to be morally unjustifiable, and all disputes or disagreements must be resolved by the way of peace. So Ultraman Cosmos is a gentle ultraman, engaging in nonviolent fights. Plot The series featured many firsts for the franchise, including the start of the story in a movie rather than the series proper. Ultraman Cosmos: The First Contact was the prequel to the series and took place eight years before episode 1. In it, 11-year-old Musashi Haruno encounters the being of light, , and befriends him as the two confront a threat to Earth. Ten years later, Musashi, now 19 and a member of Team EYES, once again encounters the being of light from his childhood. The dark being Chaos Header has appeared and is corrupting the monsters of Earth, making them become ravenous and violent creatures that threaten humanity. Through Musashi's will to see the beasts and humans live in peace, Cosmos grants him a new power that will allow him to heal the corrupted creatures.

Premise Ultraman Zearth is a parody of Ultraman. He hails from the Land of Pikari in Nebula Z95. He has a big red face and dislikes dirt, and will go to great lengths to wash it off his hands. His goal is to clean the polluted Earth. He transforms with an electric toothbrush, which is consistent with his hygiene fixation. He's not quite adept at being a superhero, but at least he tries his best. His human form is Katsuto Asahi who also dislikes dirt like Zearth. Appearances Zearth's first movie, Ultraman Zearth, was released in 1996 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the original Ultraman, as part of the Ultraman Wonderful World (along with Revive! Ultraman and Ultraman Company). Zearth's movie appearances include Ultraman Zearth (March 9, 1996) and (April 12, 1997). Ultraman Zearth 2 is paired with the first Ultra Nyan short. =Cameos by other characters= The movies include cameos by most of the original Science Patrol from Ultraman. Arashi is a helicopter reporter (which is not too far from what he currently does in real life). In Ultraman Zearth, Hayata is a night watchman (who holds his flashlight up like a Beta Capsule) and in Ultraman Zearth 2 he is a common citizen who tries to transform into Ultraman with a spoon (echoing Hayata's performance from episode 34), Fuji (the only woman who ever catches the Mydo plane taking off from a secret base exit, which happens to be a billboard), Ide (as a photographer), and Captain Muramatsu, as a fisherman. In Ultraman Zearth 2, Ide shows up as the fisherman's son with a photograph of his dad (actor Akiji Kobayashi, who played Captain Muramatsu, died between films). And finally, in Ultraman Zearth 2, we are treated to a rare cameo reappearance of Jiro Dan, none other than Hideki Go from The Return of Ultraman as a telecast reporter on TV. The second movie features \\"Digital Kanegon\\", which is a take on the original Kanegon from Ultra Q. It also features Kohji Moritsugu (Dan Moroboshi from Ultra Seven) as Captain Ban Satsuma. The running joke is that he frequently lets slip that he knows that we in the audience know that he's Mr. Moritsugu/Dan Moroboshi/Ultraseven. He says \\"Natsukashii! (how nostalgic!)\\" when he sees Capsule Monster Miraclon. At the end of the movie, he also nudges Katsuto and tells him he'll have to teach him the heel drop sometime, which implies that Dan knows that Katsuto is really Zearth.

Cotten-Poppe absorbed gold for the purpose of using it as medicine for its master, but this had the side effect of it absorbing massive quantities of energy which meant that it could explode if hit by Zearth's Speciu-Shula Ray. Ultimately, it was paralysed by Zearth, then flown into space and detonated. Ultraman Shadow , in Ultraman Zearth 2, is an anti-Ultraman Zearth robot made by Alien Lady-Benzen.

He is a robotic version of Kanegon, and contained a computer which helped the team in their studies of the Benzen aliens. =MYDO= A space-based defense organization formed around the Earth Defense Federation with the Mystery Case that seems to be an alien from the end of the 20th century. The organization name \\"MYDO\\" stands for Mysterious Yonder Defence Organization. It is an international defense force of the lower organizations, from the Asian headquarters, North America and South America, Europe, Africa, South Pacific, Silicon Valley, the Migo desert and Japan, to outer space; Delambre (Moon), Ellara, Sinope (both Jupiter), Titan (Saturn), Ariel (Uranus) also place the base. A large-scale organizational reformation was done between the first and second work. The Japanese branch camouflaged the Idemitsu Kosan gas station in the center of Tokyo, and the captains, deputy-captains,troops also work as managers, vice managers and shop clerks, hiding their identity.

In the 2nd film, a female-faced polygon appeared, and the human smelled. MYDO Mecha Their mecha used to defend earth against the monsters and also support Ultraman Zearth. *MYDO Headquarters: From the idea that the existence of outright military organizations buy antipathy of citizens in this era in which international disputes on the earth virtually disappeared, the ground part camouflaged on gas stations and the majority of base functions were established. It consists of a tower-like underground part with a height of 100 m or more. Although it was the Asian headquarters in the first film, due to an organizational reformation, it became the Japanese branch in the second work, and the headquarters base function moved to a certain place in Asia. As stated earlier, since members are usually working as gas clerk staff, on the ground part there is a skyfish launch port camouflaged in the office and cumberish main office rooms and advertisement signs as well as the facilities as a stand in the basement part, there is a room with a bell-shaped supercomputer MIDORI that manages the entire base and collects and analyzes information, including a room with skyfish storage and members, a maintenance room, a weapons laboratory, a chemical room, Data room, medical room, game hall, large public bath and training room. In the 2nd work, a locker with a special function was installed in the operational room, which caused the men's clothes to be worn instantly and teleported to the cockpit of the ride by entering the 2nd, the underground hangar was also expanded, and the starting point of the Sky Shark was newly established. When leaving the Sky Shark, the entire base will rise to the ground. Although it have been disturbed by neighbors several times, they managed to get through. *: The main fighter of Mydo. Started off from the gas station signboard. Although it is a multi-wing aircraft designed with yellow and light blue, due to the flashy color scheme, the first one was described as a \\"bad taste\\" in the reporter. In the 2nd film, Unit 2 of the same shape and different painting (red and silver color) appeared. From the 2nd work, they came to the cockpit by teleporting from the above locker. The main equipment is a Mydo laser cannon. Also equipped with firearms such as missiles. In the second work, they mounted a light wire for locking an enemy monster called a laser rope on the nose. *: Mydo's battle mother ship which appeared in the second work. Boasting advanced flight technology and fighting power, it can also work underwater, in space, in the ground, as well as ordinary aviation. It uses jet engines in the atmosphere and rocket engines in outer space. Although having a high fighting ability such as loading dozens of the latest weapons, in the play, only the Zetton light cannon which reproduced the ray used when Zetton beat the first Ultraman was used. Besides, it has a strategy conference room, a sleeping room, a game center, etc.. The Zetton beam gun is a very powerful weapon that reproduces Zetton's rays (wavy rays that destroyed the color timer) by intersecting a current of 60 million amperes and electromagnetism of 25 million gauss. In defeating Ultraman Shadow, the original Ultraman was created to destroy the timer in the same way based on the fact that the color timer was destroyed by Zetton. If it was a clean hit it was a big deal, but it was rebounded without difficulty to the shadow who had anticipated attacks on color timers and crashed in reverse. Then it was destroyed with Shadow's Meriken missile. *Mydo suit: Red and silver men's clothing worn at the time of exit, manufactured by the MYDO Super Science Team. It is super lightweight, excellent at heat and cold resistance, waterproofing and windbreak performance, and has high defense power. Dedicated boots have seven tools for every task. When working at the base, they wear the uniform at the gas station staff. *Mydo Met: It is a special helmet custom made to wear at the exit, absorbing impact by 100% and not receiving bullet/flame damage. *: A small super gun carried by all the members. Normally you can fire a laser beam and you can shoot several kinds of laser beams, heat rays, anesthetic bullets, 45 caliber simulated bullets etc. by button operation. *: Ultra high performance large beam gun similar to a shotgun, exclusively for Iwata. Cock your foregrip and charge energy. Blue destructive light bullets, yellow destructive lights, anesthetic lights can be shot and divided by button operation, and flame radiation is also possible.

The festival features a competition of giant lanterns. Because of the popularity of the festival, the city has been nicknamed the \\"Christmas Capital of the Philippines\\". Central Luzon Television is the festival's official television partner since 2008. History The San Fernando lantern industry evolved from the Giant Lantern Festival of San Fernando. The festival, which is held every December, finds its roots in Bacolor where a much simpler activity was held. Following the transfer of the provincial capital from Bacolor to San Fernando on August 1904, this lantern event followed as well. \\"Ligligan Parul\\" was said to have started in San Fernando in 1904. But some say that the \\"Ligligan Parul\\" did not happen immediately after the transfer and in fact began in 1908. This predecessor of the modern day Giant Lantern Festival was actually a religious activity which we know today as ‚Äúlubenas.‚Äù The lanterns measured just two feet in diameter, a far cry from the fifteen feet of the lanterns seen today in the festival. These were created in each barrio from bamboo and other locally available materials. During the nine-day novena before Christmas, which coincided with the simbang gabi from December 16 to 24, these paruls were brought around each barrio in procession to their visita. Before the midnight Mass on Christmas Eve, the lanterns were brought to the town church together with the barrio patrons. This tradition gradually evolved as the lanterns became bigger and the designs became more intricate. Later, one big lantern was made for each barrio, which was created through a cooperative effort. Each resident contributed to its construction, from the concept and design, to the materials and labor. In the end, these lanterns became a symbol of unity for the barrios. It was in 1931 that electricity was introduced to the San Fernando lantern, thus sparking the birth of the first Giant Lantern Festival. The added illusion of dancing lights highlighted the bright colors and intricate designs of these Giant Lanterns. At this time, the lights were controlled by individual switches that were turned on and off following the beat of the music. The barangays of Del Pilar, Sta. Lucia and San Jose were among the first barangays to participate in the festival. The first lantern festival was held to honor President Manuel L. Quezon. At that time, Quezon made Arayat his rest area and converted Mount Arayat into a tourist resort. As a show of gratitude to Quezon, the people of San Fernando held a Christmas lantern contest to honor the first family. Quezon himself donated the prize for his lantern contest, which was personally awarded to the winner by First Lady Aurora Aragon Quezon.Henares, Ivan Anthony S. The Christmas Capital of the Philippines: The Story behind the Giant Lanterns of the City of San Fernando, Pampanga It was only cancelled in 1972, 1973 and 1974 when the country declared Martial Law. In the years that followed, more innovations were introduced to the giant lanterns. Colored plastics replaced traditional papel de hapon. The use of colored plastics will continue on until 2010, wherein fiberglass and handmade paper will make their first appearances on the lanterns.Giant Lantern Festival 2010 on Large steel barrels called rotors also substituted the hand-controlled switches to manipulate the lights. And lanterns have grown in size, approximately 20-feet today, and illuminated by about 3,500 to 5,000 light bulbs. From 1990 to 1998, the festival's venue was in Paskuhan Village. In 2000, the venue was moved again to SM City Pampanga until 2007. In 2008, until now, the venue is now at Robinsons Starmills. In 2011, Brgy. Calulut and Brgy.

Bowen saw service with Horatio Nelson, and was killed fighting alongside him at the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Bowen was born into a naval family, and first saw service alongside several distinguished naval figures, including John Jervis, who would become a long-standing friend and patron to Bowen. Bowen rose to prominence after distinguishing himself in several actions, but was unable to gain a commission by the end of the war with America, and spent several years in the Caribbean, hoping to receive promotion. He took the opportunity to carry out a resupply mission to the colonies in Australia during the interwar years, a task he completed successfully, even though it involved a circumnavigation of the globe. Away from Britain for a considerable length of time while carrying this out, he found on his return that war had broken out with France. Reuniting with his old patron Jervis, Bowen returned to the Caribbean and after distinguishing himself in actions against the French colonies there, finally received his own commands. He followed Jervis to the Mediterranean and took part in several hard-fought frigate actions, and even went so far as to attack the Sant√≠sima Trinidad, the largest warship in the world at the time, in his 32-gun frigate, . He was operating off Tenerife in 1797 when he came under the command of Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson, who was quickly impressed by Bowen's zeal and ability. Bowen was given the task of leading the first wave of the assault on the town of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, but the attack went badly. The defenders poured grapeshot onto the attacking British, killing and wounding many, Bowen was killed while Nelson was badly wounded. Bowen's body was recovered and buried at sea. His friends and relations pressured the authorities for the erection of a memorial in one of the main London churches, but their requests were turned down. Family and early life Bowen was born in Ilfracombe, Devon in 1761. The Bowens were a seafaring family, with Richard's older brother James and two other siblings, George and Thomas, all serving in the navy. Richard went to sea at the age of thirteen, joining his father, who was captain of merchant ship. After two years with his father Richard joined his elder brother James' merchant ship and made trading voyages between England and Jamaica. He was at Jamaica in 1778 when news reached him of the outbreak of war with the American colonies. He applied to join the navy as a volunteer and a position was found for him by his friend, Captain Benjamin Caldwell, then the commander of the frigate . Caldwell and Bowen sailed to England in 1779, whereupon Caldwell was appointed to command the 50-gun . Finding her to be unready for sea, Bowen and a number of the officers from Emerald joined the guardship at the Nore, . Caldwell went on to equip the 14-gun ship-sloop HMS Lightning for service while awaiting the launch of Hannibal, and Bowen received an appointment to her and the position of midshipman on 12 August 1779. Despite this he does not seem to have served aboard her, instead joining under Captain John Jervis. Bowen served with Jervis aboard Foudroyant for several years. On 29 July 1781 Foudroyant was part of Vice-Admiral Sir George Darby's fleet when two French warships were sighted. The wind made prevented the British from approaching, causing Darby to order boats to tow into range. Bowen commanded one of the boats, and his actions and exertions caused favourable comments from his superiors. Perseverance was able to capture one of the French ships, which proved to be the former British , while the second French ship, the corvette Hirondelle, escaped by using her sweeps. Bowen's second chance to prove his qualities came in 1782, after Darby had been succeeded by Samuel Barrington as commander of the Channel Fleet. On 20 April an enemy French fleet was sighted by lookouts aboard Captain John MacBride's . A general chase ensued, forcing the French fleet to disperse. Foudroyant led the chase and eventually became separated from the rest of the fleet. Jervis pressed on, bringing the sternmost French ship, the 74-gun P√©gase to action early in the morning of 21 April and forcing her to surrender. Bowen acted as aide-de-camp to Jervis during the battle, and acquitted himself so well that Jervis advanced him to acting-lieutenant. Bowen also received a sword from his friend Robert Calder. The damaged Foudroyant underwent a repair and refit, during which time Jervis arranged for the transfer of some his crew including Bowen to MacBride's Artois. Bowen, serving as third-lieutenant, and MacBride cruised in the Bay of Biscay, with Richard coincidentally serving under his brother James, the elder Bowen being the master of Artois. Richard's service aboard Artois came to an end when Jervis, by now appointed commodore and commander-in-chief of a secret expedition, sent for his men to rejoin Foudroyant. The war came to an end before the expedition could be carried out and Foudroyant was paid off. Jervis found a place for Bowen as master's mate aboard HMS Pegase, the ship he had helped to capture in 1782. From there he was moved to the 98-gun and in late 1783 to the 50-gun . He went out in the later ship to the West Indies with Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Hughes. He spent three years on the station, several times being appointed temporary lieutenant but being unable to have the commission confirmed. Years of frustration Bowen returned home in 1786, and passed his examination on 7 November 1787. With the prospect of war with the Dutch looming in 1787 he received an appointment to , which was being prepared as the flagship of Admiral Hugh Pigot. Bowen hoped for a lieutenant's commission, but was to be disappointed, the war did not materialise and he found himself unemployed again. He went out to the West Indies on the advice of his brother James, and his patron Jervis, and with their recommendations he was able to secure the attention of the commander of the station Commodore Sir Peter Parker. Parker made him acting- lieutenant of the 50-gun on his arrival in January 1788, but he was superseded shortly afterwards by the arrival of Lord William Beauclerk. Temporarily shelving hopes for promotion, he took command of the government brig Lord Howe at the request of Sir John Orde, the Governor of Dominica. As captain of the Lord Howe he carried out anti-smuggling operations until July 1789. Promotion During this time Bowen made studies of mathematics, astronomy and surveying, before returning to serve under his old patron, now Rear- Admiral Sir John Jervis, in 1790 during the Spanish Armament. He finally received his long-awaited commission as lieutenant on 21 September 1790, and an appointment to Jervis's flagship . Bowen's friend Robert Calder then requested his services aboard the 64-gun . Stately was paid off after the easing of tensions and Bowen applied to the Navy Board for a posting. The Board gave him command of three transports in the Third Fleet to resupply the colony at Port Jackson, New South Wales. He departed England in March 1791 and reached Port Jackson in July that year. There the Lieutenant-Governor, Philip Gidley King, decided that the rice supply was insufficient for the needs of the colony and despatched Bowen to Bengal to acquire more. Bowen set off on the voyage, dropping King and his family at Norfolk Island on the way, and sailed east past New Caledonia, the Isle of Pines and Terra Arsacides, a route never before sailed. He also sailed a never-before navigated passage, between Borneo and Paragua into the South China Sea. From there he passed through the Straits of Malacca, reaching Bengal in January 1792. After acquiring provisions he made his way back to Port Jackson. He picked up Governor Arthur Phillip in December and returned him to Britain, arriving at Spithead in May 1793. By then he had completed two long voyages, one of them around the world, in a transport vessel. French Revolutionary Wars =Caribbean= By the time of Bowen's arrival war had broken out between France and Britain. He was offered a chance to perform a similar to mission to his earlier voyages to the colonies in Australia, but turned in down in order to serve under Jervis, now commander-in-chief of an expedition to attack the French colonies in the Caribbean. Bowen joined the fleet as fourth-lieutenant and signal-officer aboard the 98-gun , and after the fleet had rendezvoused at Barbadoes, sailed for Martinique on 3 February 1794. Jervis placed Bowen in command of the guard and gunboats after the fleet's arrival at Fort de France Bay, and instructed him to prepare an assault on a large French frigate, the Bien Venu, chained to the walls of the fort protecting the city. The frigate was rumoured to hold a number of captured English prisoners, whom the French were threatening to kill by blowing up the frigate, should the British attempt to storm the fort. Bowen developed a plan of attack and on 17 February led an assault force consisting of Boynes barge and a number of small boats. The boats rushed the frigate and the boarding party stormed her successfully. The boarding party killed or drove off all of her crew, with the exception of twenty whom Bowen took prisoner, among them the captain and lieutenant. Finding that there were no British prisoners aboard, Bowen manned the cannon and fired a broadside into the fort. He then took his prisoners off and returned to the British ships. Only the contrary wind prevented Bowen from sailing the frigate out as well. =Promotion= Bowen received a mention in Jervis's despatches, where he was credited for convincing the commanders to carry out their assault on the fortified French positions. Bowen and the gunboats supported the landings, which resulted in a British victory. Bowen's former quarry, the Bien Venu, was captured and commissioned as under the command of Captain Robert Faulknor, who had distinguished himself in the battle while commanding . Faulknor was given command of Undaunted on 20 March 1794, the same day the Bowen was promoted to master and commander, and succeeded Faulknor in command of Zebra. Bowen was promoted to post-captain in April, and briefly took command of the 64-gun , before moving to the 32-gun . He was sent out in the Terpsichore to North America, where he learnt that , under Captain Sir Charles Knowles, was being blockaded in the Chesapeake by two French frigates. Bowen set out to relieve him, an act he accomplished on 17 May, when the two British ships escaped to sea. The French attempted to pursue, but broke off when the British offered battle. Terpsichore and Daedalus sailed in company to Halifax, after which Bowen returned to the Caribbean. There he found the British positions on Guadeloupe under pressure from French forces, and helped to resupply them until it was deemed necessary to evacuate them. He ably oversaw the withdrawal, but received a wound to the face from French shot while assisting in the evacuation of the last of the troops. He received notes of praise from Rear-Admiral Charles Thompson and Vice-Admiral Benjamin Caldwell of the navy, and General Sir John Vaughan and Lieutenant-General Robert Prescott from the army. The wound however became dangerous in the Caribbean climate, and he was sent home with the despatches. =North Sea and Mediterranean= Gibraltar and Mahonesa Bowen soon recovered, and spent some time in the North Sea, until December 1795, when his old patron, Jervis, replaced Admiral William Hotham as commander of the Mediterranean Fleet. Jervis requested Bowen to come out and take command of a squadron of small vessels operating around Gibraltar in defence of British trade and the garrison there. He soon made himself popular, and contemporaries remarked on his zeal and dedication. In early October 1796 the British squadron under Sir John Man was chased into Gibraltar by a Spanish fleet. Bowen set out in Terpsichore to report this to Jervis, and having rendezvoused with of Jervis's fleet on 10 October, began the return voyage to Gibraltar. While off Cartagena on 13 October, a frigate was spotted under full sail. Bowen's crew had been reduced by sickness, but he decided to chase down the mysterious sail. After closing on her, and determining that she was attempting to manoeuvre into a position to better fight the Terpsichore, Bowen ordered a gun be fired to test her intent. This was instantly met with a broadside, and a general action began. After an hour and forty minutes the frigate surrendered, and was discovered to be the Spanish Mahonesa. She was taken into service with the British as . Bowen received a piece of plate valued at 100 guineas. Spanish ship and Vestale Bowen refitted Terpsichore and departed on another cruise, capturing several small vessels on 12 and 13 November, sending them to Gibraltar, and on 22 November he learned from an American brig that he had encountered off Cape St. Mary's, that a Spanish ship bound for Cadiz from Montevideo was in the area. Bad weather prevented Bowen from locating the Spanish vessel at first, and he also had to escape from a Spanish ship of the line that appeared and chased the Terpsichore for a while. The Spanish ship was found to be anchored in Cadiz, and at 10 am the next day Bowen entered the harbour, captured the ship and brought her out. Bowen continued to cruise off Cadiz, and while sailing through a gale on the morning of 12 December, the lookouts spotted a frigate. Bowen gave chase, with both ships hampered by the rough weather, so that it was only after 40 hours that Bowen was able to bring Terpsichore alongside and at 10 o'clock on the night of 13 December the two ships engaged each other. After two hours the frigate surrendered, and was discovered to be the 36-gun French Vestale, with 270 men aboard. She had lost her captain and 40 men killed, while her second captain and another 50 men were wounded. The Terpsichore had casualties of a quartermaster and three seamen killed, and nineteen wounded. Among the wounded was Lieutenant George Bowen, Richard Bowen's brother. George Bowen had distinguished himself during the capture of the Mahonesa, as well as being particularly active now in the capture of Vestale. Richard reported that Shortly after the French surrender all of Vestales masts and her bowsprit went by the board. She began to drift towards the breakers off Cadiz, while her crew were drunk. The British prize-crew managed to regain control, and both ships managed to ride out the storm that night. It was not until the following evening that the wind changed sufficiently for Bowen to attempt to tow his prize away. The line became snagged on a rock, and had to be cut for the safety of both vessels. When dawn broke the next day Bowen discovered that the French had risen up against the prize crew and retaken the ship, sailing her into Cadiz. Now bereft of his prize, Bowen returned to port empty handed, writing to Jervis that 'As we feel conscious of having done out duty, to the utmost of our power, we endeavour to console ourselves with the expectation of our conduct being approved.' Jervis confirmed this, writing Cape St Vincent and Sant√≠sima Trinidad Bowen was at Gibraltar when news of Jervis's victory at the Battle of Cape St Vincent arrived. He immediately set out to join the fleet, and having fallen in with several other British frigates, including , came across the Spanish first rate Sant√≠sima Trinidad. The Spanish ship was flying the Union Jack above her own colours, indicating that she was in the hands of a British prize-crew, but the bad weather meant no meaningful exchange could take place between the frigates and the Spanish vessel, and it was suspected that the British colours were being used as a ruse de guerre. After the frigates lost sight of the ship in bad weather, Bowen hurried to report the sighting to Jervis. While returning to his station he again fell in with the Sant√≠sima Trinidad, and determined to see if she would surrender to him. He opened fire on the massive Spanish vessel, at the time the world's largest warship, carrying 136-guns on four decks, over a hundred more guns than the Terpsichore. The Spanish ship resisted Bowen's fire, and he broke off the attack. It was later discovered that Bowen's attack had killed nine men, and left a number of others badly wounded. The Spanish retreat Terpsichore was in harbour, tied alongside the Mole in late May, and taking advantage of her apparent unreadiness to put to sea, two Spanish frigates carrying troops and money, attempted to leave Algeciras on 29 May. This was reported to Bowen, who quickly got Terpsichore to sea, and joining , gave chase. Rather than risk an engagement the two Spanish ships rushed back to port. Terpsichore had by now gained the nickname 'Little Devil' amongst the Spanish. Pallas returned to port, but Terpsichore lingered, and that night captured a small prize from under the guns of the Spanish shore batteries. Cutting Out of the Principe Fernando In April Jervis sent Bowen in the Terpsichore accompanied by the Dido to reconnoitre off Tenerife, where they found the Cadiz-bound Philippine frigates Principe Fernando and El Principe d'Asturia in the Bay of Santa Cruz. On the night of 17/18 April a joint cutting out expedition was mounted by the two British frigates, each sending three boats of which those from the Terpsichore under the command of its First Lieutenant (Lieutenant George Thorp) successfully captured the nearer of the Indiamen to the shore,Letters from Lieutenant George Thorp to his family Principe Fernando, sailing and towing her to sea while under fire from shore batteries for two hours. Santa Cruz and death Bowen took part in the first bombardment of Santa Cruz de Tenerife on 5 July, and worked with Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson to prepare plans for an assault on the town. In the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife on 24 July Bowen was assigned to lead the landing parties onto the mole. At the head of forty or fifty of his men he gained the mole, took the battery covering the harbour by storm and spiked its guns, and was advancing into the town in pursuit of the fleeing Spanish. As he did so the Spanish fired a large round of grapeshot onto his party, causing heavy casualties. Bowen and his first lieutenant (George Thorp) were among those killed, while Nelson and his men, who were just landing, were caught in the fire, Nelson being hit in his right arm. Bowen's body was recovered the next morning and returned to the British ships after the withdrawal. Nelson said of Bowen that '...a more enterprising, able, and gallant officer, does not grace His Majesty's naval service!' Bowen was buried at sea on 27 July. Legacy There were applications after Bowen's death for a memorial to be erected to him in Westminster Abbey. Both his brother, Rear-Admiral James Bowen, and Sir John Jervis pressured the First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Spencer, while Nelson wrote to Jervis; Spencer demurred however, on the grounds that there was no precedent for such a memorial, when the action in which he was killed was not successful. His father instead had a memorial to him erected in Ilfracombe parish church. The Naval Chronicle summarised his life and achievements; Jervis Bay in New South Wales, Australia was entered and named by Bowen in 1791 in the convict transport ship Atlantic of the Third Fleet, in honour of Admiral John Jervis. When explorer George Bass entered the same bay on 10 December 1797 he named Bowen Island in honour of Richard Bowen, who had been killed in July of that year. Notes a. George Bowen recovered from his wound, and was promoted to commander for his service during the action. Jervis wrote in his congratulatory letter to Richard Bowen B. The Vestale was captured in 1799 by Captain Charles Cunningham's .

Lady Elliot Island is the southernmost coral cay of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The island lies north-east of Bundaberg and covers an area of approximately . It is part of the Capricorn and Bunker Group of islands and is owned by the Commonwealth of Australia. The island is home to a small eco resort and an airstrip, which is serviced daily by flights from Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Lady Elliot Island is located within the 'Green Zone' of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which is the highest possible classification designated by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Marine National Park Green Zones protect the biodiversity within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park by protecting important breeding and nursery areas such as seagrass beds, mangrove communities, deepwater shoals and reefs.Interpreting zones. GBRMPA. Retrieved on 2 October 2012. The island is particularly renowned for its scuba diving and snorkelling, as its location far offshore at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef results in excellent water clarity. Flora Old Lighthouse and underwater reef The island is a vegetated shingle cay, which is uncommon. Typically these type of cays are too narrow to retain fresh water or too mobile for vegetation to take hold. Pisonia grandis grew naturally on the island. Guano mining almost completely destroyed the tree population. Fauna The waters surrounding the island are particularly rich in sealife because of a total ban on fishing or taking anything from the surrounding waters. Manta rays are abundant, attracted to the plankton around the island. The speckled carpetshark is often observed in the waters around the island. =Turtles= The Great Barrier Reef is one of the most important sea turtle habitats in the world, with Lady Elliot Island being a key part of that habitat. Every year between November and March the green and loggerhead turtles lumber up the same beach on which they were born more than 50 years ago. These turtles nest on Lady Elliot Island up to nine times in a season, laying between 80 and 120 eggs per clutch. About eight to twelve weeks later, young hatchlings leave their nests and head towards the ocean (January to April). =Whales= Lady Elliot Island is just north of Hervey Bay, a popular humpback whale resting ground along their migration route. Whales are common in the waters around the island in the winter and early spring from June to October. Regular sightings occur on the flights to the island, and while snorkelling and diving from boats and from the island's beaches. Almost daily during the season, whale songs can be heard under the water while swimming around the island. =Birds= Lady Elliot Island has one of the highest seabird diversity of any island within the Great Barrier Reef. The Capricorn silvereye, a small bird endemic to the southern Great Barrier Reef, is found on the island, which is also home to the buff-banded rail. It is an important seabird nesting site. The cay is a haven for over fifty species of tropical seabirds and wading birds. Over 100,000 birds nest on Lady Elliot Island during summer breeding season. Black noddies on Lady Elliot Island Seabirds that nest on Lady Elliot Island include: * Brown booby * Lesser frigatebird * Terns: black-naped, bridled, crested, roseate, sooty * Black noddy * Red-tailed tropicbird * Silver gull * Wedge- tailed shearwater * Eastern reef egret History =Origin= Lady Elliot Island first appeared above sea level around 1500 BC as a coral rubble spit. It developed into a mature coral cay over the next 3,000 years. Lady Elliot had endured because bird droppings have hardened together with beach sediments into beachrock. The existence of concentric shingle ridges across the island provides evidence of its formation by progradation over several millennia as deposits were laid down during episodic storms. =First commercial venture= In 1805, James Atckin began the first commercial venture on Lady Elliot Island‚Äîthe collecting of b√™che-de-mer. These animals were removed from the shallow water, dried and then smoked before being exported to Asia and Malay communities for more than ¬£180 per tonne. =Official discovery= In 1816, the island was officially discovered and named by Captain Thomas Stuart aboard the vessel Lady Elliot. The Lady Elliot was a 353-tonne vessel that was built in Bengal and registered in Calcutta, India. The ship was named Lady Elliot after Margaret, the wife of Sir Hugh Elliot, the Governor of Madras. On the return journey from Sydney, it was wrecked on a reef off Cardwell in North Queensland, and that reef is called Lady Elliot Reef. =Mining for guano= In 1863, Mr J. Askunas won tender from the Queensland Government to mine the island for guano for 300 pounds per annum for 10 years. The lease was transferred to Dr W.I. Crowther of Hobart on 23 August 1864. Dr Crowther mined the island until the end of 1873. The guano was mined by Chinese and Malay workers and sent to Mainland Australia and New Zealand. Over this period virtually all the trees were removed, as well as 3 feet of top soil and guano. In 1874, the guano mining ceased, but the damage to the vegetation of the island was absolute. It was not until 1966 that a revegetation program was undertaken by lighthouse staff. Their efforts were quickly rewarded, with the island re-emerging as a haven for all types of seabirds. =Lighthouse= The old Lady Elliot Island Light The first lighthouse to be built on the island was constructed in 1866. It was the third lighthouse built in Queensland and the first to be built offshore on the Great Barrier Reef. The original structure was destroyed by a cyclone six years later. In 1873, another lighthouse was constructed, Lady Elliot Island Light. The lighthouse is on the National Heritage list because it is a timber framed construction with a cast iron cladding, which was premade in England and shipped to the island in pieces. This lighthouse is tall and shone out approximately to sea. The old lighthouse was used continuously until 1995 but became too short for the surrounding vegetation, which was interrupting the beam of light. At this time the Australian Maritime Safety Authority built a new light tower. It is tall and its six light beams shine out to sea. It is solar powered, fully automated and runs continuously. The original lighthouse was placed on the Commonwealth Heritage List in 2004. The Lady Elliot Island Lightstation Heritage Management Plan was developed by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) in March 2012 to protect, conserve and manage the Commonwealth Heritage values of the Lady Elliot Island lighthouse. =Airstrip and resort= 200px In 1969, Don Adams (who later went on to found Seabird Aviation) built an airstrip and accommodation on the island, and was granted a tourist recreation lease by the Australian Government. In 1977, Don Adams sold the lease to Barrier Reef Airways. In 1984, the Australian Government called for tenders to construct a low-key resort on that island. The first owner of the resort lease was John and Judy French, with the resort opening in 1985. In 1992, the resort lease changed hands and was sold to Bevan Whittaker. Guided activities on the island include reef walking, glass bottom boat/guided snorkel tours, island history tours, bird watching tours and turtle treks in season. In 2005, the original 20-year resort lease came up for renewal and was put to tender. The tender was won by three Gold Coast businessmen‚ÄîPeter Gash, Grant Kenny and Michael Kyle. A new lease was granted for a 10-year period, with two options each for a further term of ten years. Since the change of lessee, a program to progressively renovate the island's facilities and make them more ecologically friendly has been implemented. The Lady Elliot Island Eco Resort Management team is dedicated to the preservation of the natural environment of the Great Barrier Reef, with their goal to work in harmony with nature for the benefit of future generations. Lady Elliot Island Eco Resort has introduced a range of environmental best-practice measures, including construction of a Hybrid Solar Power Station to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. Lady Elliot Island Eco Resort has also achieved the highest level of ECO Certification program 'ECO Certified - Advanced Ecotourism' with Ecotourism Australia. Tourist services to the island are provided by Seair Pacific. Climate Lady Elliot island has a tropical savanna climate (Aw).

Given a binary relation R between fixed strings over the alphabet, called rewrite rules, denoted by s\\\\rightarrow t, an SRS extends the rewriting relation to all strings in which the left- and right-hand side of the rules appear as substrings, that is usv\\\\rightarrow utv, where s, t, u, and v are strings. The notion of a semi- Thue system essentially coincides with the presentation of a monoid. Thus they constitute a natural framework for solving the word problem for monoids and groups. An SRS can be defined directly as an abstract rewriting system. It can also be seen as a restricted kind of a term rewriting system. As a formalism, string rewriting systems are Turing complete. The semi-Thue name comes from the Norwegian mathematician Axel Thue, who introduced systematic treatment of string rewriting systems in a 1914 paper.Book and Otto, p. 36 Thue introduced this notion hoping to solve the word problem for finitely presented semigroups. Only in 1947 was the problem shown to be undecidable-- this result was obtained independently by Emil Post and A. A. Markov Jr.Abramsky et al. p. 416Salomaa et al., p.444 Definition A string rewriting system or semi-Thue system is a tuple (\\\\Sigma, R) where * is an alphabet, usually assumed finite.In Book and Otto a semi-Thue system is defined over a finite alphabet through most of the book, except chapter 7 when monoid presentation are introduced, when this assumption is quietly dropped. The elements of the set \\\\Sigma^* (* is the Kleene star here) are finite (possibly empty) strings on , sometimes called words in formal languages; we will simply call them strings here. * is a binary relation on strings from , i.e., R \\\\subseteq \\\\Sigma^* \\\\times \\\\Sigma^*. Each element (u,v) \\\\in R is called a (rewriting) rule and is usually written u \\\\rightarrow v. If the relation is symmetric, then the system is called a Thue system. The rewriting rules in can be naturally extended to other strings in \\\\Sigma^* by allowing substrings to be rewritten according to . More formally, the one-step rewriting relation relation \\\\xrightarrow[R]{} induced by on \\\\Sigma^* for any strings s, t \\\\in \\\\Sigma^*: : s \\\\xrightarrow[R]{} t if and only if there exist x, y, u, v \\\\in \\\\Sigma^* such that s = xuy, t = xvy, and u \\\\rightarrow v. Since \\\\xrightarrow[R]{} is a relation on \\\\Sigma^*, the pair (\\\\Sigma^*, \\\\xrightarrow[R]{}) fits the definition of an abstract rewriting system. Obviously is a subset of \\\\xrightarrow[R]{}. Some authors use a different notation for the arrow in \\\\xrightarrow[R]{} (e.g. \\\\xrightarrow[R]{}) in order to distinguish it from itself (\\\\rightarrow) because they later want to be able to drop the subscript and still avoid confusion between and the one-step rewrite induced by . Clearly in a semi-Thue system we can form a (finite or infinite) sequence of strings produced by starting with an initial string s_0 \\\\in \\\\Sigma^* and repeatedly rewriting it by making one substring-replacement at a time: :s_0 \\\\ \\\\xrightarrow[R]{} \\\\ s_1 \\\\ \\\\xrightarrow[R]{} \\\\ s_2 \\\\ \\\\xrightarrow[R]{} \\\\ \\\\ldots A zero-or-more-steps rewriting like this is captured by the reflexive transitive closure of \\\\xrightarrow[R]{}, denoted by \\\\xrightarrow[R]{*} (see abstract rewriting system#Basic notions). This is called the rewriting relation or reduction relation on \\\\Sigma^* induced by .  Thue congruence  In general, the set \\\\Sigma^* of strings on an alphabet forms a free monoid together with the binary operation of string concatenation (denoted as \\\\cdot and written multiplicatively by dropping the symbol). In a SRS, the reduction relation \\\\xrightarrow[R]{*} is compatible with the monoid operation, meaning that x\\\\xrightarrow[R]{*} y implies uxv\\\\xrightarrow[R]{*} uyv for all strings x, y, u, v \\\\in \\\\Sigma^*. Since \\\\xrightarrow[R]{*} is by definition a preorder, \\\\left(\\\\Sigma^*, \\\\cdot, \\\\xrightarrow[R]{*}\\\\right) forms a monoidal preorder. Similarly, the reflexive transitive symmetric closure of \\\\xrightarrow[R]{}, denoted \\\\overset{*}{\\\\underset R \\\\leftrightarrow} (see abstract rewriting system#Basic notions), is a congruence, meaning it is an equivalence relation (by definition) and it is also compatible with string concatenation. The relation \\\\overset{*}{\\\\underset R \\\\leftrightarrow} is called the Thue congruence generated by . In a Thue system, i.e. if is symmetric, the rewrite relation \\\\xrightarrow[R]{*} coincides with the Thue congruence \\\\overset{*}{\\\\underset R \\\\leftrightarrow}.  Factor monoid and monoid presentations  Since \\\\overset{*}{\\\\underset R \\\\leftrightarrow} is a congruence, we can define the factor monoid \\\\mathcal{M}_R = \\\\Sigma^*/\\\\overset{*}{\\\\underset R \\\\leftrightarrow} of the free monoid \\\\Sigma^* by the Thue congruence in the usual manner. If a monoid \\\\mathcal{M} is isomorphic with \\\\mathcal{M}_R, then the semi-Thue system (\\\\Sigma, R) is called a monoid presentation of \\\\mathcal{M}. We immediately get some very useful connections with other areas of algebra. For example, the alphabet {a, b} with the rules { ab ‚Üí Œµ, ba ‚Üí Œµ }, where Œµ is the empty string, is a presentation of the free group on one generator. If instead the rules are just { ab ‚Üí Œµ }, then we obtain a presentation of the bicyclic monoid. The importance of semi- Thue systems as presentation of monoids is made stronger by the following: Theorem: Every monoid has a presentation of the form (\\\\Sigma, R), thus it may be always be presented by a semi-Thue system, possibly over an infinite alphabet.Book and Otto, Theorem 7.1.7, p. 149 In this context, the set \\\\Sigma is called the set of generators of \\\\mathcal{M}, and R is called the set of defining relations \\\\mathcal{M}. We can immediately classify monoids based on their presentation. \\\\mathcal{M} is called * finitely generated if \\\\Sigma is finite. * finitely presented if both \\\\Sigma and R are finite.  The word problem for semi-Thue systems  The word problem for semi-Thue systems can be stated as follows: Given a semi-Thue system T:=(\\\\Sigma, R) and two words (strings) u, v \\\\in \\\\Sigma^*, can u be transformed into v by applying rules from R? This problem is undecidable, i.e. there is no general algorithm for solving this problem. This even holds if we limit the input to finite systems. Martin Davis offers the lay reader a two-page proof in his article \\"What is a Computation?\\" pp. 258‚Äì259 with commentary p. 257\\\\. Davis casts the proof in this manner: \\"Invent [a word problem] whose solution would lead to a solution to the halting problem.\\"  Connections with other notions  A semi-Thue system is also a term-rewriting system--one that has monadic words (functions) ending in the same variable as the left- and right-hand side terms,Nachum Dershowitz and Jean-Pierre Jouannaud. Rewrite Systems (1990) p. 6 e.g. a term rule f_2(f_1(x)) \\\\rightarrow g(x) is equivalent to the string rule f_1f_2 \\\\rightarrow g. A semi-Thue system is also a special type of Post canonical system, but every Post canonical system can also be reduced to an SRS. Both formalisms are Turing complete, and thus equivalent to Noam Chomsky's unrestricted grammars, which are sometimes called semi-Thue grammars.D.I.A. Cohen, Introduction to Computer Theory, 2nd ed., Wiley-India, 2007, , p.572 A formal grammar only differs from a semi-Thue system by the separation of the alphabet into terminals and non-terminals, and the fixation of a starting symbol amongst non-terminals. A minority of authors actually define a semi- Thue system as a triple (\\\\Sigma, A, R), where A\\\\subseteq\\\\Sigma^* is called the set of axioms. Under this \\"generative\\" definition of semi-Thue system, an unrestricted grammar is just a semi-Thue system with a single axiom in which one partitions the alphabet into terminals and non-terminals, and makes the axiom a nonterminal.Dan A. Simovici, Richard L. Tenney, Theory of formal languages with applications, World Scientific, 1999 , chapter 4 The simple artifice of partitioning the alphabet into terminals and non-terminals is a powerful one; it allows the definition of the Chomsky hierarchy based on what combination of terminals and non-terminals the rules contain. This was a crucial development in the theory of formal languages. In quantum computing, the notion of a quantum Thue system can be developed.J. Bausch, T. Cubitt, M. Ozols, The Complexity of Translationally-Invariant Spin Chains with Low Local Dimension, Ann. Henri Poincare 18(11), 2017 pp. 3449-3513 Since quantum computation is intrinsically reversible, the rewriting rules over the alphabet \\\\Sigma are required to be bidirectional (i.e. the underlying system is a Thue system, not a semi-Thue system). On a subset of alphabet characters Q\\\\subseteq \\\\Sigma one can attach a Hilbert space \\\\mathbb C^d, and a rewriting rule taking a substring to another one can carry out a unitary operation on the tensor product of the Hilbert space attached to the strings; this implies that they preserve the number of characters from the set Q. Similar to the classical case one can show that a quantum Thue system is a universal computational model for quantum computation, in the sense that the executed quantum operations correspond to uniform circuit classes (such as those in BQP when e.g. guaranteeing termination of the string rewriting rules within polynomially many steps in the input size), or equivalently a Quantum Turing machine. History and importance Semi-Thue systems were developed as part of a program to add additional constructs to logic, so as to create systems such as propositional logic, that would allow general mathematical theorems to be expressed in a formal language, and then proven and verified in an automatic, mechanical fashion. The hope was that the act of theorem proving could then be reduced to a set of defined manipulations on a set of strings. It was subsequently realized that semi-Thue systems are isomorphic to unrestricted grammars, which in turn are known to be isomorphic to Turing machines. This method of research succeeded and now computers can be used to verify the proofs of mathematic and logical theorems. At the suggestion of Alonzo Church, Emil Post in a paper published in 1947, first proved \\"a certain Problem of Thue\\" to be unsolvable, what Martin Davis states as \\"...the first unsolvability proof for a problem from classical mathematics -- in this case the word problem for semigroups.\\"Martin Davis (editor) (1965), The Undecidable: Basic Papers on Undecidable Propositions, Unsolvable Problems and Computable Functions, after page 292, Raven Press, New York Davis also asserts that the proof was offered independently by A.

He was often played in ODIs, as he played 54 from 1983 to 1990, but his Test career was largely unremarkable but for one productive innings in Colombo that he scored 201 to be the first Test century as well as double century scored on debut for Sri Lanka. He is still the only test player for Sri Lanka to score a double ton on debut for Sri Lanka, and the only wicketkeeper in the World to do so. His 201* is still the highest test score made by a debutant for Sri Lanka in test history, and the highest score by a wicketkeeper on Test debut. Kuruppu is the current coach of the Maldives national cricket team. In November 2018, he was named on Sri Lanka Cricket's National Selection Panel. Early life Kuruppu was born in Colombo in January 1962, and played club cricket for Bloomfield Cricket and Athletic and Burgher Recreation Clubs. International career His international career started at the 1983 World Cup in England, where he hit two sixes and seven fours in what was to be a career-best 72 against Pakistan. Sri Lanka lost by 50 runs, and his next three matches were disappointing, as the team lost all three and he failed to pass 30. However, at Derby against New Zealand he found form again with 62, anchoring a chase towards 182 as Sri Lanka won by three wickets ‚Äì their only win in the tournament. Kuruppu was in and out of the ODI team following the successful World Cup, but did not play as a regular wicket-keeper until 1986, when he got his chance in the Asia Cup tournament against Pakistan and Bangladesh, which Sri Lanka won. He made a string of low scores, but nevertheless made an impression. The next winter, Kuruppu got his Test debut against New Zealand at Colombo Cricket Club Ground, he was called up in place of Guy de Alwis, whose continued failings with the bat had given the selectors some thought. In a match frequently interrupted by rain, and against such accomplished bowlers as Richard Hadlee and Ewen Chatfield, Kuruppu made his maiden first-class century on the second day. Sidath Wettimuny held the Sri Lankan record for the highest Test individual innings, after scoring 190 against England in 1984, Kuruppu, however, passed that score by 11 runs, making 201 not out in 777 minutes to become the first Sri Lankan to hit a double Test century. Six men have later repeated his feat. The two teams agreed to cancel the rest of the series owing to security fears, following a bomb blast near the New Zealand team's hotel. However, the double century cemented his place in the selectors' minds, and by the end of the three-team World Series tournament in January 1988, he was a regular fixture in the ODI side. However, he failed to back that up with the bat, and after a disastrous Nehru Cup in October 1989, where he strung together 36 runs in five innings and Sri Lanka finished last out of the sixth teams, Kuruppu was shuffled out of the team and Hashan Tillakaratne took his place behind the stumps. He was given one last chance as opener in 1991 when Sri Lanka travelled to England for a Test, but Sri Lanka lost by 137 runs and Kuruppu only made scores of 5 and 21. That was his last international game, but Kuruppu went on to work within Sri Lankan cricket, and he was made interim team manager for the tours of Pakistan and New Zealand in the late months of 2004. Trivia Kuruppu has played the fewest Tests of any double centurion (4 Tests), and holds the world record for scoring the slowest ever Test match double century in terms of balls (548) and in terms of minutes (777). He became the first player in history to score a century as a wicket-keeper batsman on Test debut, and is still the only such player to score a double century. We was the third player to score a double hundred on Test debut, after R. E. Foster and Lawrence Rowe. He also holds the record for the longest innings as a Test debutant (777 minutes). Kuruppu has the national record for the longest ODI innings for Sri Lanka without hitting a boundary or a six, in scoring 58* against Bangladesh.
