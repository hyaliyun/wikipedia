Its product lines include replacement heart valves, oxygenators, perfusion tubing sets, cardiothoracic surgery accessories, data monitoring, heart-lung machines, autotransfusion systems, and cannulae, and a line of blood management products. It began as a nuclear research company owned primarily by Fiat, transformed into a biomedical company upon nationalization of Italy's electric system, sold to SNIA S.p.A., and finally spun off as a separate company listed on the Milan Stock Exchange. Along the way, it and its earlier parent companies bought and sold various other companies, including Dideco, St√∂ckert, and ELA Medical. On February 26, 2015, Sorin Group announced that it will merge with fellow medical devices maker Cyberonics to form a new UK-based company called LivaNova. History Sorin is an acronym for Societ√† Ricerche Impianti Nucleari (Company for Nuclear Plant Research). It was founded in 1956 by Fiat and Montedison, Italy's two largest industrial groups at that time, to tackle the problems inherent in the production of nuclear energy. Sorin was created as a research company and was equipped with an experimental reactor for materials research. It was intended to serve as the \\"brain\\" that would mastermind the nuclear energy projects that the two groups were planning. At the time, Sorin did not have ambitions in the medical field. However, in the decade following its founding, it accumulated significant technological knowhow in all of the major areas of science. This was because nuclear energy requires expertise in many areas, from electronics to chemistry, materials technology and even experimental physics. After 10 years in business, Sorin had become a repository of knowledge and skills that were important for the country as a whole. When the nuclear power industry was hit by a crisis caused by the nationalization of the electric utilities, the Company switched businesses, focusing on technologies related to medicine, and changed its name to Sorin Biomedica (Fiat Group). The conversion was successful: in just three years, Sorin Biomedica became a self-sustaining, profitable company. This success greatly enhanced the Company's image both in Italy and Europe, as Sorin was the only European nuclear research company that was able to transform itself into an industrial company with vast technological knowhow. Over the years, Sorin continued to expand, acquiring competitors in Italy and abroad - in France and the United States in particular. In 1985, Sorin Biomedica listed its shares on the Milan Stock Exchange. In 1986 it was taken over by Snia, when Fiat conveyed a 75% interest in Sorin Biomedica to Snia. In 1992, Sorin Biomedica purchased Shiley, the Cardiovascular Devices Division of a group headed by Pfizer Inc., a U.S. company. The acquisition included (i) Dideco, an Italian company that was the European leader in the market for extracorporeal blood circulation and autologous blood transfusion products, and (ii) St√∂ckert, a leading world producer and distributor of heart-lung machines, as well as their subsidiaries. With these acquisitions, Sorin Biomedica established itself as an international player with a leadership position in Europe and a global distribution network, with an especially effective presence in the highly profitable Japanese market. Penetration of the U.S. market - the world's largest - remained limited. In 1996, the Group launched an internal project to develop a coronary angioplasty product line (catheters and stents). In this rapidly growing business, Sorin Biomedica was able to benefit from technological cross fertilization and to leverage its twenty years of experience in developing artificial cardiac valves, particularly those using CarboFilm technology. In 1999, Sorin Biomedica began marketing its Sorin CarboStent, which gained a significant market share in just a few years thanks to its outstanding clinical characteristics. In 1997, the Group divested its Immunodiagnostics operations, since their development would have required massive investments in R&D; to keep pace with technological evolution. Moreover, they offered no synergies with the Group's Cardiovascular Medical Devices operations, which had become its core business following the acquisition of Shiley. In May 1999, Snia bought Cobe Cardiovascular, a company based in Denver, Colorado, that was its main competitor in the cardiac surgery market. This acquisition propelled Sorin Biomedica to the top of the world cardiovascular market and made it the U.S. leader in the industry. The old Shiley operations were transferred to Denver, and the Cobe/Dideco/Sorin sales organizations were quickly streamlined. In 2000, Sorin Biomedica was merged into and absorbed by Snia, and its shares were withdrawn from listing. In May 2001, the Snia Group purchased Ela Medical from Sanofi - Synth√©labo. The acquisition of Ela Medical, a company with production facilities in Paris, France, strengthened the Group's position in the cardiac rhythm management market (pacemakers and implantable defibrillators). Ela Medical's assets included a vast portfolio of patents, a direct sales presence in the U.S. market and a line of FDA-approved products, as well as a respectable share of the European market. In April 2002, the Snia Group acquired from Dialinvest S.A. control of Soludia, a French company specializing in the manufacture of dialysis solutions, thereby strengthening the product portfolio and European presence of the Renal Care Business Unit. In January 2003, the Snia Group bought from Centerpulse the CarboMedics Group, a U.S. producer of mechanical heart valves based in Austin, Texas, and Mitroflow, a Canadian-based producer of tissue valves. This acquisition significantly strengthened the position of the Sorin Group in the cardiovascular industry and increased its penetration of the U.S. market. In addition, the acquisition made Sorin the world co- leader in mechanical heart valves and significantly expanded its tissue valve business. In January 2004, following Snia's partial proportional demerger, the Sorin Group, which is headed by the holding company Sorin S.p.A., had been listed independently on the Online Stock Market of Borsa Italiana. A reversal of a decade of downsizing at the Denver (Arvada), USA location is due to recent transfer of Sorin's Plymouth, MN operations into part of the vacated site in Denver.

The resolution stated that the US should not sign a climate treaty that would 'mandate new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the Annex I Parties, unless ...[it]... also mandates new specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for Developing Country Parties within the same compliance period', or would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States. This effectively prohibited the US from ratifying the Kyoto Protocol.  Impact  Despite the unanimous passage of the Byrd-Hagel resolution, U.N. Ambassador Peter Burleigh signed the Kyoto Protocol on behalf of the Clinton Administration on November 12th 1998. However the Clinton Administration ultimately withheld the treaty from acquiring Senate approval due to potential political backlash and disapproval. During the Bush administration, Senators Robert Byrd, Jesse Helms, Pat Roberts, and Larry Craig issued a letter to President George W. Bush to identify the President's stance on the Kyoto Protocol and climate change policy. President Bush responded \\"I oppose the Kyoto Protocol because it exempts 80 percent of the world, including major population centers such as China and India, from compliance, and would cause serious harm to the U.S. economy. The Senate's vote, 95-0, shows that there is a clear consensus that the Kyoto Protocol is an unfair and ineffective means of addressing global climate change concerns.\\" During the Obama administration, the U.S. pursued climate policies such as the Copenhagen Accord and Paris Agreement in advocating for more comprehensive environmental reform an to allow nations to self determine their own emission based commitments.Biniaz, Susan. ‚ÄúWHAT HAPPENED TO BYRD-HAGEL?

Marston describes it as \\"pure and ambient\\" as a contrast to the buzzy trebley guitar and fake reverb found on some older black metal. The guitars were doubled with different tones and recorded in the same room as the amps so that feedback proliferates the recording.

Born in Carrigtwohill, County Cork, Fouhy first played competitive hurling during his schooling at Midleton CBS. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Cork minor team before later joining the junior side. He joined the senior panel during the 1944 championship. Fouhy subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won three All-Ireland medals, two Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. As a member of the Munster inter- provincial team on a number of occasions, Fouhy won four Railway Cup medals. At club level Fouhy enjoyed a twenty-year career with Carrigtwohill Throughout his career Fouhy made 24 championship appearances. He retired from inter- county hurling following the conclusion of the 1957 championship. Playing career Club Fouhy played his club hurling with his local club in Carrigtwohill and enjoyed some success. His major moments of victory came in 1949 and 1950 when Carrigtwohill captured back-to-back county intermediate championship titles. Minor Fouhy first played for Cork as a member of the minor team in 1941. He was an unused substitute that year as Cork claimed the All-Ireland title after a 3-11 to 1-1 defeat of Galway while also claiming a delayed Munster title following a 4-6 to 3-3 defeat of Tipperary. Senior =Beginnings= In 1944 Fouhy joined a Cork senior team on the brink of history as they aimed to capture a fourth All-Ireland title in-a-row. On 3 September 1944 Fouhy was a member of the substitutes as Cork faced Dublin in the All-Ireland decider. Joe Kelly was the hero of the day and he contributed greatly to Cork's 2-13 to 1-2 victory. In spite of playing no part in the game Fouhy still collected an All-Ireland medal. Fouhy was suspended from the Cork senior team in 1946 after lining out illegally in a club game in Waterford. It was a move which cost him an All-Ireland medal. During this period he spent two unsuccessful years with the Cork junior team. On 29 June 1947 Fouhy made his senior championship debut when he came on as a substitute in Cork's 3-10 to 1-5 Munster semi-final defeat of Waterford. He remained on the substitutes' bench for the subsequent All-Ireland decider against Kilkenny on 7 September 1947. A last-minute point from Terry Leahy resulted in a 0-14 to 2-7 defeat for Cork. =Three-in-a-row= After a period in the wilderness Cork bounced back in 1952 with Fouhy as a regular member of the team. After missing much of Cork's provincial campaign, he was back at right wing-back on 6 September 1952 as Cork faced Dublin in the All-Ireland decider. In spite of only leading by three points at half-time Cork eventually won by 2-14 to 0-7 and Fouhy picked up a first All-Ireland medal on the field of play. Fouhy won a National Hurling League medal in 1953 following a 2-10 to 2-7 defeat of Tipperary. He later collected his first Munster medal on the field of play following a 3-10 to 1-11 defeat of Tipperary. On 6 September 1953 Cork faced Galway in the All-Ireland final. The game itself is remembered as one of the ugliest championship deciders ever and is clouded in controversy due to the injury to the Galway captain, Mick Burke. Cork won the game by 3-3 to 0-8, with Fouhy winning a second All-Ireland medal. In 1954 Fouhy won a second Munster medal on the field of play as old rivals Tipperary were bested by 2-8 to 1-8. A record crowd of 84,856 attended the subsequent All-Ireland decider on 5 September 1954 with Wexford providing the opposition. Wexford had a four-point lead with seventeen minutes left to play, however, history was against the new team of the decade when Johnny Clifford scored the winning goal for Cork with just four minutes left. A narrow 1-9 to 1-6 victory secured a third successive All-Ireland for Cork and for Fouhy. =Decline= Four- in-a-row proved beyond Cork, however, the team returned for one last hurrah in 1956. After missing much of the team's successful provincial campaign, Fouhy was restored to the starting fifteen for the All-Ireland showdown with Wexford on 23 September 1956. The game has gone down in history as one of the all-time classics as Christy Ring was bidding for a record ninth All-Ireland medal. The game turned on one important incident as the Wexford goalkeeper, Art Foley, made a miraculous save from a Ring shot and cleared the sliotar up the field to set up another attack. Nicky Rackard scored a crucial goal with two minutes to go giving Wexford a 2-14 to 2-8 victory. Fouhy retired from inter-county hurling following Cork's defeat by Waterford in the 1957 Munster decider. Inter-provincial Fouhy also lined out with Munster in the inter- provincial hurling competition and enjoyed much success. He first lined out with his province in 1950. That year he picked up his first Railway Cup winners' medal as Munster triumphed over Leinster. It was the first of four Railway Cup titles in-a-row for Fouhy and for Munster. Munster were defeated by Leinster in 1954 as Fouhy hoped to make it five-in-a-row. Death On 27 April 1977, Fouhy died aged 53 at St. Finbarr's Hospital in Cork after taking ill the previous day. After the news of his death, leading figures from the world of hurling paid tribute to him, with former teammate and incumbent GAA president Con Murphy described him as \\"a most accomplished and sporting hurler and one of nature's gentlemen.\\" Fouhy was survived by his wife Dympna, two daughters and a son.

In early 1944 she was reassigned to be operated by J&J; Denholm Ltd, but in February she was bought by the Admiralty. She made her last wartime voyage as part of one of the Corn cob convoys, sailing from Poole to the Seine Bay in early June 1944. She was scuttled at Juno Beach on 9 June 1944, forming one of the corn cobs designed to shelter the landing beaches for the invasion forces.

Foss is most noted for his Norwegian language novel, Husmands-gutte (1885) which was translated into English as The Cotter's Son. A story from Sigdal. Biography Foss was born in Modum, Buskerud county, Norway. He was the son of a small tenant farmer, Anders Knudsen Fossen and his wife Karen Marie Henriksdatter. Foss immigrated to the United States in 1887. Hans Andersen Foss, Biography (Fiction by ND Authors. Read North Dakota. 2006) A lifelong proponent of the temperance movement and the Populist Party, Foss edited several temperance publications. In 1886‚Äì87, he was editor of the Dakota Bladet magazine in Portland, North Dakota. From 1888 to 1893 served as editor for the Norwegian language newspaper Normanden in Grand Forks, North Dakota. In 1892, Foss was nominated as the North Dakota Populist Party candidate for Congress, but lost the election. Afterwards Foss gave up both politics and the newspaper business and became a grain dealer, eventually settling in Minot, North Dakota during 1906.Lovoll, Odd Sverre The Norwegian Press in North Dakota (Norwegian- American Historical Association. Volume 24: Page 78) Foss wrote a number of novels, many first serialized in Norwegian language newspaper. Foss's writing style made him a popular author among Norwegian-American immigrants. However, Foss's lasting literary contribution is principally his influence on later, more widely known writers such as Peer Stromme and Ole R√∏lvaag.Mossberg, Christer Lennart Scandinavian Immigrant Literature (Texas Christian University Press, 1998). Foss is most associated with his 1885 novel, Husmandsgutte, (English: The Cotter's Son). The book, which tells the story of Ole Haugen, the son of the poor farmer in Sigdal, Norway, is considered by many to be a most accurate depiction of the lifestyle of farm workers in Norway. The popularity of The Cotter's Son serial was credited with saving the Decorah Posten from bankruptcy. The Cotter's Son has long enjoyed popularity in Norway, where numerous editions have been published.Skardal, Dorothy Burton The Scandinavian Immigrant Writer in America (Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume 21: Page 14) Foss was married twice and had seven children. He died during 1929 in Minot, North Dakota and was buried at Rosehill Memorial Park. Selected works *Husmandsgutten.

It entered the UK charts at number two, losing out on the number one spot to Bob Dylan's Together Through Life. Background and recording Following a short break, the trio spent the majority of autumn 2008 recording in rural Wales at Monnow Valley Studio in South Wales with producer Jim Anderson and Mike Crossey. Whilst the plan was to capitalise on the buzz from their debut, the band didn't rush the sessions. \\"We totally took our time,\\" Clarke stated. In early 2009, The Enemy completed the recording of the album. On their official MySpace blog, the band described the album as a \\"big step forward\\", deciding to \\"go back to basics with the recording and do it all on tape rather than computers which is how the vast majority of modern records are made, and as a result it sounds huge, like a proper old school rock record\\". They also described the album as having a more \\"raw and punkier sound\\", whilst Clarke noted that, although he was aiming to address various issues with the album's lyrics, the band took a less organised approach in writing them; The lead single, \\"No Time For Tears\\", was debuted on BBC Radio 1 on 17 February 2009, including an interview with the band discussing tour dates and their \\"new sound\\". The single was officially released on 13 April, with the album following a fortnight later on 27 April. As part of the promotion for the album, the band played a number of gigs in small, intimate venues throughout February 2009, in Lincoln, York, Dundee, Wakefield, Tunbridge Wells and Corby. The video for the second single, \\"Sing When You're In Love\\", was debuted on T4 on 9 May 2009, and released on 22 June. The third single, \\"Be Somebody\\", was used as theme music for FIFA 10 by EA Sports and in ITV's FA Cup football coverage.Be Somebody Songfacts It is played pre-match at the Ricoh Arena by Coventry City. Critical reception The album received mixed reviews scoring 4.5/10 at aggregator website AnyDecentMusic?, and 55/100 at Metacritic. John Earls of Planet Sound saw the LP as a progression from the band's debut album, but found fault with the lyrical content. The album was pilloried for its alleged plagiarism. Commenting on the opening track \\"Elephant Song\\", Drowned In Sound noticed its similarity to Led Zeppelin's \\"Kashmir\\". \\"Last Goodbye\\" and its use of strings was compared to The Verve. The chorus of \\"Last Goodbye\\" also bears a striking resemblance to Blur's \\"The Universal\\". \\"Nation of Checkout Girls\\" was also derided for sounding identical to \\"Common People\\" by Pulp, while another song on their album \\"Don't Break The Red Tape\\" has also been criticised for sounding similar to \\"London Calling\\" by The Clash. The BBC described the album as \\"terrible\\", asking, \\"What did the people ever do to deserve this?\\" Drowned In Sound concluded: \\"Never has reaching the end of a record been met with such a massive sigh of relief.\\" In The Independent, Andy Gill called the album's title \\"sinister...as if all other music were somehow against \\"the people\\" (whoever they are); or as if the band's modest creations had been officially sanctioned as fit for our ears\\". He was sceptical of the album's political content, writing that \\"I'm instinctively suspicious about this kind of eagerly populist music, which invariably hides naked commercial ambitions behind a facade of oppositional posturing\\".

The impermeable granite rocks are very suitable for water capture though the undulating landscape alone does not allow the vertical drops needed for power generation. However, in 1950 the barrage was built and a goit dug leading to the Lac de Villefranche-de-Panat where the waters drop 461m vertically to the power station at Le Pouget on the Tarn river. This is the fifth largest hydroelectric reservoir by area in France having an area of 1260 hectares. It was formed by creating a dam across the Vioulou, and pumping water 6.4 km, up 80 m from the 53-hectare Bage reservoir on the Bage river and water from the 200 ha Pont-de-Salars reservoir on the Viaur. Waters from Pareloup can be directed either through the downstream Viaur to the power station at Thuries or through a 10.9 km tunnel to the power station at Alrance at the head of the Lac de Villefranche-de-Panat. A small amount (3.5 hm3) is extracted for use as drinking water in Rodez and S√©gala.

Aarti (Nivedita Bhattacharya) is the mature and responsible elder sister while Vidhi (Prachi Shah) is the impulsive, slightly childish but loving younger one. As luck would have it, the sisters find suitable matches in Viraj (Anupam Bhattacharya) and Abhishek (Yash Tonk), two brothers who are devoted to each other. But there is a twist: because of their parents' insistence on matching horoscopes, Aarti, the elder sister, is married to Abhishek, the younger brother; while the younger sister Vidhi marries the elder brother Viraj. This leads to a few awkward situations, but the couples are basically quite happy. However, a series of trying circumstances overcomes the lives of the four, threatening to tear their most valuable relationships apart. How they overcome these challenges, and how their mutual love prevails in the end, forms the story of Kundali.

She was built by Boole, of Bridport and was launched on 9 February 1806. Although she took part in the capture of Martinique, Guadaloupe, and Saint Martin, she appears to have had an uneventful career until 8 October 1812, when the American sloop-of-war captured her after a fierce fight. Later that day the British recaptured Frolic and captured Wasp. Frolic was broken up in 1813. Career On 26 October 1807, Tsar Alexander I of Russia declared war on Great Britain. The official news did not arrive there until 2 December, at which time the British declared an embargo on all Russian vessels in British ports. Frolic was one of some 70 vessels that shared in the seizure of the 44-gun Russian frigate Speshnoy (Speshnyy), then in Portsmouth harbour. The British seized the Russian storeship Wilhelmina (Vilghemina) at the same time. The Russian vessels were carrying the payroll for Vice-Admiral Dmitry Senyavin‚Äôs squadron in the Mediterranean. Frolic, under Commander Thomas Whinyates, sailed for the West Indies on 21 February 1808. There she participated in the Invasion of Martinique in February 1809, and then in the invasion of Guadeloupe. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issuance of the Naval General Service Medal with clasps \\"Martinique\\" and \\"Guadaloupe\\".Mayo (1897), Vol. 2, p.300.

They reported back that survival prospects were poor. As it turned out, Jeffrey was alive, a passing American vessel having rescued him. Still, a court-martial dismissed Lake from the Royal Navy.{sfnpDerriman2006pp=108-11}} Frolic vs. Wasp In October 1812 the Frolic was serving on the North American station, protecting a convoy of six merchantmen off Virginia. On a passage from the Bay of Honduras, a gale dispersed the convoy and carried away Frolics main top yard and sprung her main top mast. On 18 October, while the convoy was reassembling and Frolic was working on the damage, a strange sail was spotted. Frolic sent the convoy on its way and hoisted a Spanish ensign as a ruse to buy time. The strange sail turned out to be , of 18 guns, commanded by Jacob Jones. The ships closed. Initially Frolic fired more rapidly but less accurately, but the gale damage had rendered her unmanageable. Within 40 minutes Wasp had repeatedly raked Frolic, killing 15 and wounding 43 out of the 120 seamen and boys aboard, including Whinyates. The Americans boarded Frolic and all resistance stopped. The Americans had 5 killed and 5 wounded. Frolic was only temporarily in American hands. Later that day the British 74-gun captured both ships. Captain John Poo Beresford of Poictiers restored Whinyates to command of Frolic. The subsequent court martial for the loss of the ship honorably acquitted Whinyates, his officers and his men.James (1837), Vol. 6, p.112. Fate Frolic was recommissioned later in October under Lieutenant Andrew Mitchell (acting). His commission as commander was confirmed on 24 August 1813. Earlier, on 20 July 1813, Frolic was one of four British vessels sharing in the capture of the American ship Fame. Frolic continued in service until being broken up at Portsmouth in November 1813. Her captured ensign was on display at Mahan Hall at the U.S. Naval Academy, but was removed on 27 February 2018 for preservation.

Its chemical formula is KCr(SO4)2 and it is commonly found in its dodecahydrate form as KCr(SO4)2¬∑12(H2O). It is used in leather tanning. Production and properties Chrome alum Chromium alum is produced from chromate salts or from ferrochromium alloys. Concentrated aqueous solutions of potassium dichromate can be reduced, usually with sulfur dioxide but also with alcohols or formaldehyde, in the presence of sulfuric acid at temperatures <40 ¬∞C. Alternatively and less commonly, ferrochromium alloys can be dissolved in sulfuric acid and, after precipitation of the ferrous sulfate, the chrome alum crystallizes upon addition of potassium sulfate. Chromium alum crystallizes in regular octahedra with flattened corners and is very soluble in water. The solution reddens litmus and is an astringent. Aqueous solutions are dark violet and turns green when it is heated above 50 ¬∞C. In addition to the dodecahydrate, the hexahydrate KCr(SO4)2¬∑6H2O, dihydrate KCr(SO4)2¬∑2H2O, and the monohydrate KCr(SO4)2¬∑H2O are known.Gerd Anger, Jost Halstenberg, Klaus Hochgeschwender, Christoph Scherhag, Ulrich Korallus, Herbert Knopf, Peter Schmidt, Manfred Ohlinger, \\"Chromium Compounds\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. Uses Chromium alum is used in the tanning of leather as chromium(III) stabilizes the leather by cross linking the collagen fibers within the leather. However, this application is obsolete because the simpler chromium(III) sulfate is preferred.

He learned reading, Latin, French and mathematics by himself. According to his contemporary Andrew Michael Ramsay, the Duke found a copy of Newton's Principia in the grass in his garden, and was astonished to find it belonged to the 18 year old Stone. The Duke became his patron., page 68. Under the Duke's protection, Stone arrived in London in 1723 and published his first book: Treatise on Mathematical Instruments. In 1725 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In the following years he published some papers in the Philosophical Transactions., page 215. His book A New Mathematical Dictionary appeared in 1726, and was drawn in part from the Latin versions of the German philosopher Christian Wolff's mathematical works. He also published a translation into English of Euclid's Elements (London: 1728) and The Method of Fluxions, both Direct and Inverse (London: 1730). The first part of the Method of Fluxions is a translation of the book by L'H√¥pital., McTutor History of Mathematics. Stone translated Isaac Barrow's Geometrical Lectures (London: 1735) from Lectiones Opticae et Geometricae (1669) which had originally been revised, corrected, and amended in Latin by Sir Isaac Newton.

He is said to have lived for thirty more years and on his death was buried there for the second and last time.Michaelides, M.G. \\"Saint Lazarus, The Friend Of Christ And First Bishop Of Kition\\", Larnaca, Cyprus, 1984. Reprinted by Fr. Demetrios Serfes at St. Lazarus The Friend Of Christ And First Bishop Of Kition, Cyprus The Church of Agios Lazaros was built over the reputed (second) tomb of Lazarus.  History and architecture  Tomb of Saint Lazarus in the Church of St. Lazarus Tradition says that the place of Lazarus' tomb was lost during the period of Arab rule beginning in 649. In 890, a tomb was found in Larnaca bearing the inscription \\"Lazarus, four days dead, friend of Christ\\". Emperor Leo VI of Byzantium had Lazarus' remains transferred to Constantinople in 898. The transfer was apostrophized by Arethas, Bishop of Caesarea, and is commemorated by the Orthodox Church each year on October 17. The transferred relics were later looted by the Fourth Crusade in the early 13th century and were brought to Marseille but subsequently lost. In recompense to Larnaca for the translation, Emperor Leo had the Church of St. Lazarus erected over Lazarus' tomb in the late 9th to early 10th centuries. The church is an elongated building measuring 31.5 x 14.5 m with a tripartite sanctuary, semicircular apses internally and three- sided externally and a five-sided apse in the center. The interior structure of the church is divided into three aisles with bulky double pillars and arched openings going through them. These pillars bear the weight of the domes thus forming the central aisle while the north and south aisles bear a semi- cylindrical roof, intersected by cross-vaults. The stonework of the church consists mainly of square limestone block about a meter in thickness. The church has an open porch, from which steps descend into the church. Under Frankish and Venetian rule (the 13th to 16th centuries), the church became Roman Catholic. A stone covered portico (stoa) of Gothic style was added on its south side during this time. Iconostasis of the Church of St. Lazarus The three imposing domes of this Orthodox Basilica Church and the original bell tower were destroyed, probably in the first years of Ottoman rule (1571 AD), when the church was turned into a mosque. In 1589, the Ottomans sold it back to the Orthodox, probably because of its Christian cemetery. For the next two hundred years it was used for both Orthodox and Catholic services. The porch bears traces of Greek, Latin, and French inscriptions. In 1857, after the Ottoman authorities again allowed Cypriot churches to have bell towers, the church's bell-tower was rebuilt in a Latinate style. The woodcarving of the unique baroque iconostasis of the church was done between 1773 and 1782 by Chatzisavvas Taliadorou. The iconostasis was gold-plated between 1793 and 1797. Some of the icons were painted towards the end of the 18th century by Michael Proskynetes from Marathasa. Icon painter Hatzimichael completed the iconography of the iconostasis in 1797. Some of the wood-carved furniture (including a Rococo pulpit on one pillar for Catholic use) and icons on the walls are from the 17th century. A fire in 1970 damaged much of the interior, including extensive damage to a section of the iconostasis together with the corresponding icons.Dubin, Marc and Damien Morris (2002). Cyprus: The Rough Guide (4th ed.). Published by Rough Guides. . The iconostasis has been partially restored and was re-plated with gold between 1972 and 1974. During the subsequent renovations of the church, on November 2, 1972, human remains were discovered in a marble sarcophagus under the altar, and were identified as part of the saint's relics (not all having been removed to Constantinople, apparently).  Traditions  On Lazarus Saturday, eight days before Easter, the icon of Saint Lazarus is taken in procession through the streets of Larnaca.

It was released on 9 February 2009 on the UK-based indie label Close Harbour Records. Around the 10-year anniversary of First Love, Emmy re-released the album on vinyl in June 2019 and embarked on a tour, performing the album in music venues around the UK, also in June 2019. Background Moss explains that she never chose to write any of the album's songs any certain way, \\"they just came out\\". She does, however, admit that \\"...breaking up with my boyfriend when I did had a huge influence.\\" She describes the album as \\"a record of the time that it was made, and the time I spent waiting for it to come out, and now that time is over. It's actually quite weird that other people are only just hearing it. Members of my family will bring up a song and I‚Äôll be like, 'that is so 2008.'\\" The first single, \\"We Almost Had A Baby\\", was released on 10 November 2008. In January 2009, a promotional version of the album was leaked on a number of music forums. Moss then posted a blog on her MySpace page asking people not to download it, saying that the first run of promos had been of the wrong master, and were of a lower quality than the album that would be released officially. Music videos were released for \\"We Almost Had A Baby\\", \\"First Love\\" and \\"MIA\\". Critical response The album met with generally positive reviews on release. British webzine Drowned in Sound praised it as \\"a triumph, with a maturity beyond her years, and with a humour no less enjoyable for being subtle\\", while The Guardian described Moss' style as \\"ultra-wordy, but also articulate and interesting.\\" NME, however, was more equivocal, criticising her \\"constant stance of diary-entry victimhood\\" as becoming \\"more grating than engaging\\". Moss' songwriting was widely praised, with webzine TwistedEar saying that her lyrics are \\"Emmy the Great's secret weapon, and save First Love from mediocrity.\\" The album was ranked at No. 7 on The New York Times \\"Albums of the Year 2009\\" list.

The line was acquired by the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) in 1875. The Utah Southern Railroad name was initially kept as a separate division of the UP, but over time the line was moved around and divided among different UP subsidiaries. A significant portion of the line, from Provo to Lynndyl, is today known as the Sharp Subdivision. A non-contiguous portion of the line through the Salt Lake Valley is today owned by the Utah Transit Authority and used for the TRAX light rail system. History The first portion of the line was constructed between Salt Lake City and York (south of Santaquin), and acquired by the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) in 1875. Under UP ownership, extensions to the line reached as far south and west as Frisco. In 1881 the railroad was merged into the Utah Central Railway, another UP subsidiary. In 1889 that subsidiary was merged into the Oregon Short Line and Utah Northern Railway, another UP subsidiary.Don Strack, UtahRails.net: Union Pacific in Utah, 1868-1899, accessed August 2008 The line was transferred and divided during construction of the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad, then partially owned and later fully owned by the Union Pacific. The portion of the former Utah Southern from Lynndyl to Milford was used for the LA&SL; main, and remains in use as the primary Southern California - Utah rail trunk today, today known as the Lynndyl Subdivision. The remainder of the former Utah Southern became spurs from the LA&SL; main. The spurs to Eureka and Frisco were eventually abandoned. The LA&SL; and Utah Southern used different routes between Lynndyl and Salt Lake, resulting in duplicate tracks between those two cities. The Utah Southern built tracks were routed to Salt Lake via Leamington Canyon of the Sevier River, passing through Nephi, Santaquin and Provo; the newer LA&SL; built tracks were routed farther west in the desert, via Tooele and around the north end of the Oquirrh Mountains. Over time the tracks via Tooele became the preferred route for through traffic and the tracks via Provo became the secondary or local route. The route via Provo is no longer contiguous. The portion between Provo and Lynndyl is still part of the Union Pacific, and is known as the Sharp Subdivision; the portion through the Salt Lake Valley is no longer contiguous with the rest of the line, nor part of the Union Pacific network.Don Strack, UtahRails.net: Union Pacific in Utah, 1900-1996, accessed August 2008 Between Salt Lake City and Provo the former Utah Southern line ran roughly parallel to the Denver and Rio Grande Western's Utah Division. Between these cities, the former Utah Southern route became mostly unused for through traffic after the two companies began sharing track in the 1980s. This portion was later abandoned and the right of way sold to the Utah Transit Authority. The portion of the UTA owned right of way that has been rebuilt provides the corridor for a significant part of the TRAX light rail system, forming almost the entirety of the corridor of the Blue Line. Freight traffic on this portion is now managed by the Salt Lake City Southern Railroad.

Lindberg in 1997, is an older taxonomy of the class Gastropoda, the class of molluscs consisting of all snails and slugs.Ponder W. & Lindberg D. R. (1997). \\"Towards a phylogeny of gastropod molluscs: an analysis using morphological characters\\". Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 119(2): 83-265. The full name of the work in which this taxonomy was published is Towards a phylogeny of gastropod molluscs: an analysis using morphological characters. This taxonomy assigns the various Gastropods into ranked categories, such as sub-orders and families, but does not address the classification of genera or individual species. This classification scheme is based on the molluscs' internal and external shapes and forms, but did not take into account any analysis of their DNA or RNA. The classification below was the most recent until Bouchet and Rocroi published their revised taxonomy in 2005, which differs primarily in that the higher taxa are expressed as unranked clades where known, and termed \\"informal groups\\" or groups\\" where monophyly (a single lineage) has not yet been determined, and where polyphyly (more than one lineage) is suspected. Ponder & Lindberg (1997) used only four families to analyze the Euthyneura. Further work by Dayrat & Tillier (2002)Dayrat B. & Tillier S. (2002). \\"Evolutionary relationships of euthyneuran gastropods (Mollusca): a cladistic re-evaluation of morphological characters\\".

At an elevation of , its surface area is , making it the largest lake in France in winter, but second after Lac du Bourget in summer. The lake is classified as a Local Nature Reserve, and use of boats on the lake are prohibited for all but a small number of licensed professional fishermen.  Tourism  Due to the lake classification, as a protected area, its access is restricted. Navigation on the lake is prohibited; only seven professional fishermen have been granted specific authorisation to do so. Because of its shallow topography, and its wild vegetation, the lake is difficult to access. Except during the winter floods, it is only accessible from a few locations, such as at Bouaye in the north, at Pierre Aig√ºe in Saint-Aignan-Grandlieu and la Chevroli√®re in the east. For visitors, a museum has been created to present the lake and its ecosystem as well as the history of local fishermen. An observatory allows tourists to have a look at the wildlife in its natural habitat. An exhibition on the lake is offered at The lake House at Grand-lieu in Bouaye and a tour is also available at The old Guerlain Pavillon which overlooks the lake.  Historic   Prehistory and antiquity  In the site the soil was formed about 50 million years, the current topography around two millions years ago, and the transformation of the current landscape took shape during the Neolithic period. Six thousand years ago the areas which had not been filled by the sand were covered by a dense forest. The deposits of this forest build overtime and it is today the fifth largest in France. It contains around 29 million cubic meters of peat. The bottom of the lake is composed of various deposits and their thickness can reach about thirty meters. Aquifers containing fresh water have been formed in these layers. An analysis at carbon 14 has been used to date that water, the result showed that is water would be locked up for 8 700 years.  Middle ages  Before the creation of a piping work during the 18th century, the water of the lake was released via the large swamp close to the island of Couetils, then join the course of the Tenu river which cross this zone before reaching the large Loire river. The zone where the junction with The Tenu occur was made close to the island Marguerite (area which was originally called the three channels) During the system of feudalism, the lake was owned by the lordship of Grand-Lieu. After 851 AB, under the Breton rule, the lake was placed under the Royal guardianship and then under the duke tutorship. In 1145, Conan III duke of Brittany gives his right to the monks from the Abbey of Buzay. They will keep the rights for around 150 years, which also included the right to fish. They then decided to concede those right to the lord De Vieillevigne, for an annual rent of seven livres. From 1387 the rent has stopped The Machecoul-Gastineau then take possession of the rights which they do not have and expropriate the property title The control of this domain, with the absence of firm land, is not without consequences: the population around the city of Nantes receive fresh water fish from the lake. The lord are given a right of ‚ÄúWater‚Äù, which means they have the right to fish with a large fishing net, which allows them to catch the fish in very large quantity  Modern times  After the Middle ages, during the modern times, the population living around the lake were the victims of the frequent flood. It is during the 18th century that human greatly changed the life of the lake, with the construction of different channel .In the north the construction of The Acheneau canal will make the regulation of the flows possible. The name Acheneau originates from the French work chenal which in the English language means channel. The Acheneau leaves from the north of the lake, joins the course of the Tenu, and then goes towards the Loire River  After the French revolution  In 1809, the Comte August de Juigne, who is the holder of the rights on the lake, project to drain and dry it in order to use it to grow crops. At that time is type of initiative was common, relying on the economic argument but also on the problem related to health that wetlands can bring to the close population. The Juigne family will, from there, try fiercely to carry out this project, which will be briefly threaten by the French Revolution but the family lordship right will ended be maintained. In 1844, the owner of the lac are the Juigne family, Louis de Saint-Aignan‚Äô family, the family Juchault des Jamonieres and the Comte Antoine d'Eserot d‚ÄôEstr√©e . The project then faces the population living around the lac. During the 19th century the future of the lac is decided by the confrontation between the Comte de Juigne and the syndicate of the Buzay channel run by local public figure The Comte also has to work against people who grant, illegally, part of the lake for themselves. He does not hesitate for instance to conduct an action against the Jamoni√®res‚Äô family . His project is to dry out part of the land in the hope to sell them as farmlands, he hopes to get back around three thousands hectares. At the end of the 18th century, Gustave Juign√© who succeeded his father , also plan to conduct a drainage of the lake, but this time he encounters an intervention from Gustave Roch, the \\"Loire-Inf√©rieure\\" deputy. The parliament decided to open a report on the public domain, and the Council decided that the question of the lake ownership could only be decided by the Justice.

It was, in essence, an organization dedicated to political persecution of senior party leaders as well as ordinary functionaries. Initially conceptualized as a beachhead by Chairman Mao Zedong's most radical supporters to 'gather dirt' on opponents of the Cultural Revolution, it later began taking up cases against all manner of perceived political opponents irrespective of their ideological allegiance. Many of its early leaders, such as Jiang Qing, later themselves became the subject of persecution by the Group. The Group was compared by Cultural Revolution-era propagandist Wang Li to the Soviet Cheka, but he noted that the CCEG had even broader powers. Its leading members included nearly all of the members of the Cultural Revolution Group (CRG) as well as Premier Zhou Enlai and the chief of Mao's security detail Wang Dongxing. The CCEG worked closely with the CRG during its investigations.MacFarquhar & Schoenhals, p. 282 Background The precursor to the CCEG was the Special Case Examination Committee, an organ established by the Politburo in May 1966 to investigate the political offences of Peng Zhen, Luo Ruiqing, Lu Dingyi and Yang Shangkun. When it was found that there was a need for analysis of other cases, the committee was retained under a new name, and soon achieved a permanence as a central institution. Role in the Cultural Revolution The Central Case Examination Group was founded at roughly the same time as the Cultural Revolution Group (CRG). The CRG was essentially \\"command central\\" of the Cultural Revolution. However, unlike the CRG, the CCEG was to operate throughout the entire of the Cultural Revolution decade and beyond, investigating and reporting on the purported crimes of many of the members of the higher echelons of the Communist Party of China (CCP) and all people considered to be counterrevolutionary. The group's highest profile case was that of Chinese President Liu Shaoqi, whose case was reportedly investigated by 400,000 people (including some Red Guards from Peking University), looking at over four million files.MacFarquhar & Schoenhals, p. 277 The findings of the CCEG on President Liu Shaoqi were compiled into a seventy-four page report to be considered by the Twelfth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the CCP that met in October 1968. It was at this plenum that Liu Shaoqi was officially expelled from the CCP. The CCEG's membership included most of the membership of the Cultural Revolution Group and Zhou Enlai, with Mao Zedong's wife Jiang Qing taking a particularly active role in the building of cases against individuals.MacFarquhar & Schoenhals, p. 281 In addition, other members included Wang Dongxing and Ye Qun, the wife of Lin Biao. The CCEG was responsible to the Politburo Standing Committee, and wielded significant power in the realm of public security. It took the decisions to arrest, torture and imprison suspected 'revisionist' elements. For example, at the time of Twelfth Plenum in October 1968, 88 fully fledged or 'alternate' members of the CC were under CCEG investigation. By the autumn of 1967, the CCEG had become too large an operation for its existing structure, and so the group was subdivided into a First Office and a Second Office. The First Office, led by Wang Dongxing, took responsibility for the cases from the initial phases of the Cultural Revolution, including cases surrounding Peng Zhen and his supporters. The Second Office, led by Yang Chengwu and (following Yang's demise in March 1968) General Huang Yongsheng, was solely concerned with the cases of members of the military. It took over several cases of senior PLA soldiers, including that of Marshal He Long. In 1968, a Third Office was established under Xie Fuzhi to investigate the May 16th Conspiracy, involving some members of the Cultural Revolution Group. The Third Office would later take on other cases of conspiracy groups.all the information about the structure of the CCEG comes from MacFarquhar & Schoenhals, p. 283 Although there were suggestions that the CCEG should be dissolved at the same time as the Cultural Revolution Group, in 1969, it was retained as an institution for the remainder of the Cultural Revolution decade, continuing its investigative role until after the Cultural Revolution itself ended. In 1970, the group started to examine the case against Chen Boda, who was one of the staunchest proponents of the Cultural Revolution but by this point had fallen from political favour, and in 1971 the CCEG also began to investigate Lin Biao.MacFarquhar & Schoenhals, p. 284 In 1975, in an effort to bring the Cultural Revolution to a close, Mao ordered that the CCEG conclude its major cases swiftly and release of some prisoners. This led to the release of around 300 prisoners in the middle of 1975.MacFarquhar & Schoenhals, p. 344 Dissolution  The last case assigned to the CCEG was the case of the 'Gang of Four'. Jiang Qing, once an active member of the CCEG, came under investigation by the very apparatus she had been involved in. After completing its analysis of the 'Gang of Four' case, the Central Case Examination Group was formally dissolved after thirteen years of operation at the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, held in December 1978.

Yamli search  Arabic and Arabic dialects content on the web exists in two forms: in Arabic Script and in ad hoc Latin phonetic representations (Arabic Chat Alphabet). Finding relevant content for an Arabic query on a traditional search engine can be difficult because it requires trying many Latin variations of that query. Yamli Search seeks to address this problem by expanding an Arabic search query to its most frequently used Latin spellings. The search query is forwarded to a traditional search engine, returning a larger number of relevant results than the original query would have.CNN on \\"Window opens to Arabic Web\\" The following are examples of Latin query expansions automatically performed by Yamli Search: * : Mohammed Bin Rashid, Mohamad Ben Rached, Mo7amed Bn Rachid, etc. ‚Ä¶ * : Habibi ya nor el ein, 7abibi ya noor el 3ayn, etc. ‚Ä¶ Yamli Search queries are forwarded to Google for web and news, wikipedia for encyclopedic searches, Bing for image searches and YouTube for movie and video searches.

The western spur is crowned by the Hopetoun Monument to John, 4th Earl of Hopetoun, who commanded the British Army in the Peninsular War, after the death of Sir John Moore at Corunna. Barnes Castle is built on south, while Garleton Castle is on the north slopes.  Geology  The Garleton Hills create an obvious ridge, from the top of the ridge there are wide views over the lower lying areas of East Lothian. The hills are made up of layers of igneous rocks from the Carboniferous which show differing resistance to erosion. In some places the volcanic rocks are both overlaid and underlaid with sandstones. In the volcanic sequence of the hills there is hard basalt lying over trachytic lavas. Glacial erosion has varied according to the variations in the resistance of the rocks. The trachytes slope to the south south east and have been moulded into cuestas, or volcanic trap steps, by the ice. There is a steep north facing scarp with a short dip slope lying to the south of the scarp. The flow of ice and meltwater along the strike of the ridge has eroded furrows and channels. Around the village of Athelstaneford there is a rock basin which has been partly gouged out of the softer basalts. The hills are designated by Scottish Natural Heritage as a Geological Conservation Review site (nr. 1155) and as Site of Special Scientific Interest by the British Geological Survey as Site of Special Scientific Interest (code of the site: 671).

Etymology The origin of the term is unclear. One suggested origin is from the name of Scottish explorer William Balfour Baikie. Using his last name to describe \\"white man\\" or other Igbo expressions like Ala Bekee, Ndi Bekee translates to \\"land of Baikie, white people\\". Other explanations have been proposed. It could be a word from the Igbo language where it describes a European. A local tradition holds that it is derived from the question ¬´ eh b√© qu√© ? ¬ª (¬´ eh bien quoi ? ¬ª, similar to \\"What's up\\"), an expression picked up from the French settlers. Another explanation is that its origin lies in the term ¬´ blanc des quais ¬ª (\\"a White from the quay\\") as the White colonists and merchants controlled the ports. In contrast, the \\"Blanc Cr√©ole\\" (or \\"Blan Kr√©yol\\" in creole) is use for White people born in the Antilles and adapted to the creole life who are not descendants of the first White settlers.Du Neg nwe au Beke Goyave, le langage de la couleur de la peau en Martinique, Isabelle Michelot ¬´ Il est compos√© du compl√©ment du nom -p√©yi (signifiant local) en construction directe sans connotation √©conomique, par opposition au B√©k√© (o√π le s√®me de \\"riche\\" est dominant) et au petit blanc (o√π le s√®me \\"pauvre\\" est dominant), appellation m√©prisante du blanc qui n‚Äôa pas r√©ussi √©conomiquement ¬ª \\"Blanc Pays\\" (or \\"Blan P√©yi\\" in creole) is used to talk about the B√©k√© of Guadeloupe.

Local authorities work with La Asociaci√≥n Nuestros Ahijados in the rescue process, and rely on ITEMP to provide short- and long-term rehabilitation for rescued victims. ITEMP is unique in Guatemala, because the program works with adults as well as children. ITEMP fights trafficking and exploitation in three distinct ways: through rescue, rehabilitation, and public education. The project also focuses on prevention through public awareness and education, as well as by hosting the annual Guatemalan National Trafficking in Persons Congress. Activities ITEMP aggressively seeks custody of children being trafficked and/or exploited. The project also provides short- and long-term housing for all victims, through host families for minors, and shelter for adult victims. The rehabilitation process works to provide the tools for a better life. Counseling and education are made available for children, as well as technical and vocational training for adults. ITEMP also works to educate the people of Guatemala and the U.S. about trafficking and the terrible atrocities faced by exploited persons, and the resources available to help those who need it. Goals Victims of trafficking and exploitation are coerced through fear tactics, violence, and a lack of knowledge of the resources available to them. Rescue is only the first step. The goals of ITEMP are: protection, prevention, and, on a smaller scale, prosecution. Many of those rescued are at a very high risk of falling victim to trafficking or exploitation again. Long-term rehabilitation, including education and counseling, provides tools to resist being victimized in the future and requires significant funding to ensure its success. ITEMP and Nuestros Ahijados are dedicated to the complete rehabilitation of rescued persons regardless of the amount of time it takes. Children that enter the program at the age of six or seven will be taken through the program until the completion of their education, sometimes all the way through medical or law school. Such long-term commitment is rarely available and makes ITEMP an essential asset to the people it serves. Community cooperation While assisting victims is crucial, long-term solutions include educating the general public. Community cooperation is essential in the battle against modern slavery. ITEMP is currently coordinating an agreement between local hotels to refuse the rental of rooms to minors, or persons other than family members wishing to rent rooms with minors. Stories like Ana's (see below) are all too common, and must not be tolerated. Awareness on the part of the public creates intolerance of such atrocities being committed to those who can't, or don't know how to, defend themselves against exploitation. Many victims are unwilling to cooperate with authorities to prosecute traffickers because they still believe they are in danger, or do not wish to relive the terrible acts they've survived. ITEMP provides counseling and legal services to work with victims in the hopes of increasing prosecution of traffickers in Guatemala. ITEMP recognizes that trafficking in persons is a complex problem that requires multiple acts of intervention to eradicate exploitation of, and trafficking in persons. ITEMP works with other programs/NGOs, as well as the Guatemalan government to better aid victims and increase prosecution of offenders.

It was first released on 1 October 2008. The story revolves around the ups and downs of the life of five teenagers and how they cope with their surroundings. Plot The film begins following the finale of the TV series which revolves around a group of five teenagers from different backgrounds and how they cope with everyday struggles of growing up in the big city of Kuala Lumpur which struggles to remain conservative in the progressive 21st century. Abu runs away from the Henry Gurney School juvenile facility after getting into a fight with other inmates. He is then reunited with his four best friends, Ali, Lynn, Addi and Sophie who are celebrating the completion of their Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia public examination that marks the end of their school careers. The five of them spend their last few weeks together before they each move on to their separate adult lives. Lynn introduces Abu to a book called 'The Traumas of Utopia.' Fascinated by its poetry, Abu steals a copy from the public library. He also stays at Ali's place for awhile since he is not yet prepared to face his parents. Eventually, Abu goes home to visit his dotting mother but flees after coming face to face with his disciplinarian father. Abu is estranged from his father, who keeps comparing him to his dead elder brother, who was an overachiever that made their parents proud. Meanwhile, Abu's friends have struggles of their own as well. Unknown to anyone, Abu's brother was Addi's chat buddy named Vanilla Ice with whom she was falling in love with. Not realizing that he has been murdered, Addi is still looking for closure ever since her chat buddy disappeared. Abu tries to help her by introducing her to a middle-aged man pretending to be Vanilla Ice. Sophie's socialite mother is left by at the altar by her fiance, Jamal. Fearing that her daughter will leave her too, she hides Sophie's acceptance letter from a foreign university in order to keep her close. Lynn, who writes comics under the pseudonym Teka-Teki, decides to stop publishing her popular fanzine series, KAMI. Instead, she starts writing reviews for a local magazine. She ends up writing an unfavourable review on an up-and-coming indie band called The Disasters, which Ali is secretly a member of. Apart from his struggling band and his dreadful desk job at a tour agency, Ali is faced with his parents impending divorce and turns to drugs for comfort. Later that weekend, the five friends attend a mini-concert to cool off some steam. Lynn bumps into Boy, a drug dealer who she once sold drugs for before she moved to the city from Hulu Selangor. A fight breaks out when Ali and Abu try to help Lynn avoid Boy and his minions. A few days later, Boy once again confronts Lynn but Ali intervenes by paying off her debts for her. Lynn is offended by Ali's interference and warns him not to get involved in her life anymore. On the other hand, Boy is angered by the wealthy Ali's arrogance and swears to get revenge. A desperate Ali contacts Razak, a pusher to get some ecstasy pills. However, his phone call is answered by Boy, who instructs him to meet one of his subordinates to get the drugs. Boy then threatens Lynn into meeting a new customer to provide him with the drugs. In a twist of events, the subordinate Ali is supposed to meet turns out to be Lynn and the new customer she was instructed to meet is Ali. The two friends are shocked to learn each other's secret. Following a disastrous performance by The Disasters, Ali tries to leave as he cannot focus on his performance due to all his personal problems. Boy shows up at the scene and tries to stab Ali in the back. However, Abu ends up getting stabbed while trying to push his friend out of the way. His friends rush him to the hospital in Ali's car but he dies. A few days after Abu's funeral, Lynn notices he had left his bag at her mother's food stall. In it she finds a letter addressed to Addi which explains the disappearance of Vanilla Ice. Lynn sends the letter to Addi, who finally gets the closure she has been looking for all this time. In the end, Ali leaves his job at the tour agency and joins The Disasters as a full-time member. Sophie eventually finds her acceptance letter and decides to further her studies at the university. Ali finds the book Abu stole in the backseat of his car. While visiting Lynn to mend their friendship, they find a note in the book written by Abu. He wrote, \\"Life is a bitch, but there's still tomorrow.\\" The two friends then contemplate the meaning of Abu's words on their uncertain futures.

Ramlee as Abu's mother Production According to Lina Tan, the Executive Director of Red Films Sdn Bhd, the film which is targeted at teenagers is about \\"a commercial film which revolves around teenagers' conflicts and their reactions in determining their future.\\" The catch phrase of this film is \\"Hidup ini memang palat, tapi esok masih ada.\\" The word \\"palat\\" has been featured in the promotion materials that are included in KAMI: Vol II soundtrack, as well as in the official website. However, the word has been eliminated from the further promotion materials as well as from the dialogues in the film since it was considered as a vulgar word. This film marks the first attempt of Effendee Mazlan as the director of a commercial film, as well as Fariza Azlina Isahak, who has written the script for the first time. Among the companies that were involved in the making of this film was Hotlink and Monkey Bone Records. Release Kami was released to 43 cinemas across Malaysia on the first day of Hari Raya, and had a tight competition with Senario The Movie: Episode 1 which was released at the same day. Although it was predicted that it would not be able to compete with Senario The Movie, it went to raise RM1.4 million in the first two weeks of screening and it managed to avoid the possibility of massive loss. Critical reception Initial critical reception to Kami was generally positive reviews. Izuan Shah from Gua.com said that \\"the premise of this film is very simple and interesting to grasp the attention of modern teenagers\\", giving the movie a rating of 8 out of 10. His compliment went to Nas Muammar who \\"commanded the character Abu convincingly with his natural talent\\" as well as Zahiril \\"who has the potential of a newcomer\\". Nurulhisham Abdul Latiff from Berita Harian complimented all the casts for their successful performance, especially Liyana Jasmay, Nas Muammar and Zahiril. However, she further commented that \\"the recording style of this film is unsuitable for some audience\\" but \\"it was a fine job afterall.

McCready still owns the record fastest fall in an NCAA final, pinning Ralph Freese of the University of Kansas in just nineteen seconds at the very first NCAA wrestling championship in 1928. Summer Olympics McCready competed for Oklahoma State University in folkstyle, and as a freestyle sport wrestler who competed for Canada in the 1928 Summer Olympics At the 1930 Empire Games he won the gold medal in the heavyweight class. McCready attracted the attention of Oklahoma State wrestling coaches when he defeated their heavyweight at a 1926 tournament in Canada. McCready came to the Stillwater, Oklahoma college, where he played football and wrestled. In three years of wrestling varsity, the 5'11\\", 238-pound McCready was 25-0, with all but three of his victories by pin. As an Oklahoma State Cowboy, McCready won three NCAA heavyweight titles (1928-1930), becoming the first three-time NCAA champion at any weight. He was also the first foreign- born NCAA wrestling champ. He is one of only two collegiate wrestlers with three NCAA titles to win all three of his finals matches by pin (the other being Dan Hodge of the University of Oklahoma, 177-pound champ, 1955-1957). McCready still owns the record fastest fall in an NCAA final, pinning Ralph Freese of the University of Kansas in just nineteen seconds at the very first NCAA wrestling championship in 1928. Professional wrestling Following McCready's graduation from Oklahoma A&M; with a degree in physical education, he became a pro wrestler in late 1930, pursuing a professional wrestling career.

It concerns the early history of the vibrator, when doctors allegedly used it as a clinical device to bring women to orgasm as treatment for \\"hysteria.\\" Other themes include Victorian ignorance of female sexual desire, motherhood, breastfeeding, and jealousy. The play was nominated for three 2010 Tony Awards. List of characters *Catherine Givings ‚Äì wife of Dr. Givings and mother to Letitia, a woman in her late twenties and full of life, but sexually frustrated with her marriage. *Dr. Givings ‚Äì Catherine's husband, a man in his forties and a specialist in gynecological and hysterical disorders. *Sabrina Daldry ‚Äì Dr. Givings' patient, a pianist in her early thirties struggling with hysteria and infertility. *Leo Irving ‚Äì Another patient of Dr. Givings', an English artist in his twenties or thirties. *Annie ‚Äì Dr. Givings' midwife assistant, a woman in her late thirties. *Elizabeth ‚Äì An African-American housekeeper, and later wet nurse, in her early thirties. *Dick Daldry ‚Äì Sabrina Daldry's husband, a man in his forties or fifties. Plot Summary Act One Dr. Givings, an electrical scientist, lives with his wife, Catherine, and their newborn, Letitia, in upstate New York during the late 19th-century. With the recent innovation of electricity entering American homes, Givings harnesses it to create a machine designed to cure female hysteria by inducing \\"paroxysms\\" - innocently giving birth to the vibrator. He treats his patients in an operating theater within his house, the eponymous \\"next room,\\" alongside his assistant and midwife, Annie. While he believes his wife to be physically strained from an excess of milk that is insufficient to feed their child, Catherine is sexually dissatisfied with her husband, who is fascinated by electricity and struggles with intimacy. In late November, the doctor brings in a new patient, Sabrina Daldry, and her husband, Dick, who has grown frustrated with the inhibitions arising from his wife's hysteria. While Givings treats Sabrina with the vibrator, Mr. Daldry and Catherine romp in the rain, and when he returns, he is delighted to see that there is a considerable difference in Sabrina‚Äôs health. Catherine inadvertently reveals her struggle with nursing Letitia, and Mr. Daldry suggests hiring their housekeeper, Elizabeth, an African-American woman, as a wet nurse, as she recently lost her son to cholera. In the privacy of their home, the Givings‚Äô discuss Catherine‚Äôs anxieties about bringing in a stranger to nurse Letitia. The next day, Dr. Givings gives Elizabeth a medical exam, determining she will be a healthy wet nurse. Catherine observes her feeding the baby and reacts emotionally; she tries to explain to her husband about her insecurities of motherhood, but Dr. Givings is more interested in medicating Mrs. Daldry with another round of electrical therapy in the next room. With his assistant absent, however, Sabrina has a much more difficult time reaching a paroxysm, and after he attempts to stimulate her with higher voltage, a power outage occurs. Annie arrives and administers manual treatment to Sabrina, causing her to ejaculate, while Dr. Givings works to restore power in the house. Elizabeth prepares to return home to her own family and is asked by Catherine if she plans to have more children, before divulging her own personal fears of childbirth and the great pain she felt when Letitia first tried to nurse off of her. Meanwhile, Annie displays her knowledge of Greek philosophy to Mrs. Daldry, who asks her to begin teaching it to her in private lessons. When everyone has left, the Givings‚Äô endeavor to be sexually intimate in the living room, but are interrupted by Mrs. Daldry, who has come back to retrieve her hat and is seemingly faint. The doctor resolves to treat her with the vibrator, much to his wife's chagrin, but when Annie‚Äôs absence gives her trouble reaching a paroxysm once again, he successfully uses what he refers to as \\"vulvular massage\\" in addition to the instrument. Catherine, who has been eavesdropping at the door, demands that her husband conduct electrical therapy on herself, but he denounces the idea as unseemly and unprofessional. Mrs. Daldry leaves again, and Dr. Givings, growing suspicious of his wife, locks the operating theater before leaving to attend a club of scientific academics. Sabrina returns to the Givings‚Äô home a third time, this time to retrieve her gloves, and describes to an intrigued Catherine the sensations of the vibrator. Curiosity gets the better of her, and she picks the lock to her husband‚Äôs laboratory, finally laying eyes on the instrument. Mrs. Daldry offers to stimulate Mrs. Givings with the device, but she has an intensely negative reaction to it. She offers to conduct the therapy to Sabrina, and despite her insistence that Dr. Givings should be the only one to take such responsibility, she takes the offer, the curtain falling as Mrs. Daldry has her third paroxysm of the day. Act Two It has been two weeks since Catherine and Sabrina‚Äôs adventure with the vibrator and Dr. Givings is seeing a new patient - Leo Irving, a rare case of male hysteria. Leo, a painter, recounts the source of his hysterical symptoms, which he believes to be a heartbreak he suffered from a woman he fell in love with in Florence. Dr. Givings unveils his latest invention, specifically designed to medicate hysteria in a man; a device that inserts into the anus, which he refers to as the \\"Chattanooga Vibrator.‚Äù Meanwhile, in the living room, Catherine struggles to connect with her baby, who was previously smiling and attentive for Elizabeth. After a quick and successful session, Leo meets Catherine on his way out, charming her with his old-fashioned tendencies and shared preference for candlelight over electric lamps. She then converses with Sabrina about continuing to explore the vibrator on their own accord behind her husband‚Äôs back, but their plans are interrupted by the doctor, who brings her into the operating theater for therapy. Mr. Irving returns to the Givings‚Äô, having forgotten his scarf, and becomes enamored with Elizabeth upon meeting her. He insists he must paint her nursing Letitia, creating a post-Civil War Madonna, and after generous offers for payment, she tepidly agrees, but only if Catherine sits in the room during the painting to make it feel not so improper. Mr. Daldry arrives to escort Elizabeth and his wife back to their home, and with everyone gone, Catherine discloses to her husband concerns with retaining Elizabeth‚Äôs employment, for fear of her getting too attached to Letitia. Their conversation quickly turns to an argument as Catherine claims she is mentally unwell and begs to be treated in the next room, and Dr. Givings postulates it is because of the excess of milk. Reluctantly, he agrees to medicate her with the vibrator. In the operating theater, Dr. Givings attempts to conduct therapy with his wife as he would with any other patient, but the experiment quickly turns sexual as Catherine insists they kiss while he holds the instrument to her person. Frustrated when he refuses to do so, she dresses herself to leave, recounting as she does so how when she first met the doctor as a young girl, she wrote her name in the snow outside his window in the hopes he would notice her. She flees the house in a fury while Dr. Givings, in a creative stir, summons Annie to help him draft plans for a vibrator made of water, designed to treat more excitable patients such as his wife. Catherine reappears with Leo after running into him during the first snowfall of the season, and openly flirts with him, much to his discomfort. She requests that he show her where her husband placed the vibrator in their session earlier, and as she places her hand on his cheek, Dr. Givings enters from the operating theater. Mr. Irving, embarrassed, makes his exit quickly, and Mrs. Givings presses the doctor about whether he is jealous over her hand being on his cheek; he claims that, because of the many shades and degrees of love, the moment was irrelevant and unimportant. Catherine, hurt, reveals she was hoping he would be envious, further straining their relationship. A week passes, and Leo has been regularly painting a nursing Elizabeth while also rebuffing Catherine‚Äôs romantic advances. One day, Dr. Givings returns home to bear witness to the painting and hides his repulsion with the scene. He quickly administers electrical therapy with Leo and proclaims he is cured, allowing them to stop the treatments permanently. Later in the day, Mr. and Mrs. Daldry arrive for Sabrina‚Äôs treatment. Catherine and Sabrina distract Dick by sending him into the Givings‚Äô winter garden, while they discuss with Elizabeth the odd, dichotomous sensations of the vibrator. Elizabeth, confused, believes it to be the result of sexual relations with their husbands, but Mrs. Daldry claims that such feelings during sex would be incredibly embarrassing - her husband is always careful to silently make love to her in complete darkness. Mr. Irving leaves the Givings‚Äô home apparently cured, and walks an uncomfortable Elizabeth back to her apartment. Sabrina is taken into the operating theater for therapy as her husband returns from the garden. While she is unsuccessfully massaged with the device, Mr. Daldry advances on Catherine to kiss her, and she audibly slaps him and has him take a carriage home. Annie offers to wield the instrument as the treatment has taken longer than usual, and Dr. Givings uses it as an excuse to confront his wife about the slap he heard from the living room. Before leaving for the club, he subtly implies his speculation that she has been unfaithful with the men in her life. In the next room, Mrs. Daldry and Annie begin a Greek lesson following their success with the vibrator. Sabrina asks why she is unmarried, and, as Thales said to his mother, she woke up one day and found it to be too late. Before her exit, Mrs. Daldry plays the piano alone in the living room; Annie arrives and, after she finishes the song, kisses her passionately. Overwhelmed, Sabrina leaves and states it would be best if they stopped seeing each other. Catherine answers the doorbell to find Elizabeth has returned, who resigns from her role as a wet nurse, as her husband needs her at home to help with their other children. When Catherine muses how she would die of sorrow should her baby die, an impassioned Elizabeth explains that at first she felt great resentment to Letitia for taking the milk that was meant for her dead son, but when she saw how grateful she was for it, it was hard to believe the feeling to be anything but love. Before leaving, she urges Catherine to hold Letitia close and remember the blood of her son that kept her alive. The doorbell rings again, and Leo arrives to say goodbye, as he is moving to Paris. Catherine begs him to take her with him, explaining how he has seduced her in his talk of beauty and sex, but Mr. Irving confesses he is in love with Elizabeth, who rejected his feelings earlier in the evening when he walked her home. Catherine makes a final appeal by disclosing her loneliness, but he dismisses her affections, reminding her that she cannot feel so isolated when she belongs to a family that loves her. Leo leaves, and Catherine, more alone than ever, tries to use the vibrator on herself but still feels nothing pleasurable. Dr. Givings returns to the house and is alarmed to see her using the instrument, but he soon admits his jealousy when she concedes that she has fallen in love with Leo. Catherine then confronts him regarding his intentions for their relationship; to love her and indulge her longing for pleasure, or to merely be a doctor and make her feel better. The doctor admits that he would like to love her but does not know how, and, in medical jargon, lists and kisses her most beautiful facial features. Touched by his vulnerability, Catherine leads him to the garden, and the two undress and make snow angels with their bare bodies. The curtain falls as Catherine climbs atop her husband and mounts him, discovering the woman on top sex position, allowing her at last sexual satisfaction. Staging The set is divided between two rooms, a parlor and a doctor's office. At the play's climax, the actors step through the imaginary wall dividing the rooms to create the third and final scene, outdoors in the falling snow. Background In the Director Presentation Les Waters states the play was inspired by The Technology of Orgasm: Hysteria, the Vibrator, and Women‚Äôs Sexual Satisfaction by Rachel P. Maines. Ruhl cites Maines's book, AC/DC: The Savage Tale of the First Standards War (Tom McNichol) and A Social History of Wet Nursing in America (Janet Golden) as books she was reading or which influenced her when she wrote the play.\\"Sarah Ruhl: 'A Note from Sarah Ruhl', In The Next Room The Berkeley Rep Magazine , 2008-09, Number 4, p. 23 The play was commissioned by the Berkeley Repertory Theatre, which received an Edgerton Foundation New American Play Award towards the production of the play.

He was born in 1944 in Tabriz, East Azerbaijan Province, northwest Iran. During his 2-year military service, he worked as teacher-soldier in a small mountain village located on the Caspian coast. A sense of loneliness in this remote village drove him to find his talent in sculpture. His first works of sculpture were of Einstein, Bertrand Russell, Beethoven, and Dr. Albert Schweitzer. He then worked for a short period in Parviz Tanavoli's atelier in Tehran. In 1972, he studied art in Italy as a student at the Accademia di Belle Arti (Academy of Fine Arts) of Florence. After returning to Tabriz, he concentrated upon his work and created his 12 sculptures called \\"Misery Around the World\\" which he presented them to the Azerbaijan Museum. The works are made of bronze and consists of different depictions of human misery. Between 1980 and 1982, Hosseini taught sculpture in Tabriz and edited a book entitled \\"What is Art?\\".

Rugby career Towers originally played rugby for local club Hartlepool Rovers, and represented his county side, Durham. After moving to Wales, Towers switched to first-class Welsh team Swansea. It was while playing for Swansea that Towers was first selected to play for Wales in a game against Ireland as part of the 1887 Home Nations Championship. Towers was one of two new caps on the day, the other being Llanelli's John Goulstone Lewis. Under the captaincy of Tom Clapp, Wales beat the Irish team even though Ireland outscored Wales three tries to one; a peculiarity of the scoring system of the time. In 1888 Towers, now captain of the Swansea senior team, gained his second and final international cap when he was chosen to face the touring New Zealand Natives.

The Protectorates are marked as Anxi, Anbei, Andong. The Tang dynasty in Inner Asia was the expansion of the Tang dynasty's realm in Inner Asia in the 7th and, to a lesser degree, the 8th century AD, in the Tarim Basin, across the Gobi Desert and into Middle Asia. Wars were fought against the Gokturk Empires and Xueyantuo, but also against the states of the Tarim basin. This expansion was not steady; for example, the Tang did lose control of the Tarim basin temporarily to the Tibetans in the 680s, and their expansion north of the Gobi was thwarted in 682. Emperor Taizong's military success was, in part, a consequence of changes he initiated in the Chinese army, including improved weaponry. The emperor placed a new emphasis on cavalry, which was very important because his non-Chinese opponents used the horse effectively in warfare.Latourette, Kenneth Scott. (1965). The Chinese: Their History and Culture, p. 144. History Emperor Taizong's campaigns in the Tarim Basin Mural commemorating victory of General Zhang Yichao over the Tibetan Empire in 848. Mogao cave 156, late Chinese Tang Dynasty Tang expansion The Tang dynasty was one of the Golden Ages of Chinese history. Coming out of the devastation of the late Sui, Tang emperors were eager to secure China's borders by defeating the Gokturks who were the primary military threat to North China. As a result, Tang forces mounted several campaigns against the Gokturks in order to neutralize them and secure China's borders in the process. Securing the Tarim Basin, which contained key trade routes, was also a secondary objective. =Tang conquest of the Eastern Gokturks= The Eastern Gokturks were the primary threat to the Tang dynasty. Following Liang Shidu's defeat and death, the Tang dynasty prepared to march against the Eastern Gokturks. In 630, the Tang army marched against the Gokturks and defeated them in Southern Mongolia, sending them to flight. However, the real victory came when Li Jin, regarded as one of China's best generals, surprised the Eastern Gokturk Khan with a fast force of 3,000 Cavalry at the battle of Ying shan, which also involved a rear guard of over 100,000 Tang troops. This battle destroyed the Gokturk army, resulting in the capture of the Khan and over 120,000 Gokturks. Thus ended the Eastern Gokturk Empire. Emperor Taizong of Tang took up the title of Tian Kehan, or \\"Heavenly Khan\\" of the Gokturks. =Tang conquest of Xueyantuo= Xueyantuo had helped Tang armies defeat the Eastern Gokturks, but after the demise of the Eastern Gokturks, Xueyantuo-Tang relations turned hostile because Xueyantuo kept on making attacks on Gokturks who were now Tang subjects. In 642, Taizong sent an army to attack Xueyantuo and destroyed it. =Tang Conquest of the Western Gokturks= The Western Gokturks were not an initial threat to the Tang, so initially relations were peaceful. However, Civil war and dispute in the Western Gokturks gave the Tang the opportunity to expand into Central Asia. From 642 to 645, the Tang army defeated the Western Gokturks and drove them out of Dzungaria. In 657, the Tang defeated the last Western Gokturk Khan and took over all Western Gokturk territory. =The second G√∂kt√ºrk Kaghanate= In what has been described as \\"a response to a surge of something like national sentiment\\",Grousset, Ren√©. (1970). The Empire of the Steppes, p. 103. the Eastern T√ºrkish Kaghanate was restored in 682 by Elterish (a.k.a. Qutlugh).Sinor, Denis. (1990). Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia, p. 310. In the Orkhon inscriptions, Elterish's son describes the modest beginnings of Elterish's struggle against the Tang thus: > My father the kaghan set out with seventeen men, and as the word spread that > he had set out and was advancing, those who were in the towns went up into > the mountains and those who were in the mountains came down, they gathered, > and there were seventy-seven men. Because heaven gave them strength, the > army of my father was like wolves and his enemies were like sheep.

The new Kaghanate was centered on the upper Orkhon river and in the √ñt√ºk√§n, presumably the Khangai mountains. After decades of war and border raids with China, peace was made in 721‚Äì22.Grousset, p. 112. The second Gokturk Khanate remained a tributary and vassal of the Tang dynasty. It then survived until the 740s, when it fell due to internal conflicts and was succeeded by the Uighur KaghanateSinor, p. 313. Battle of Talas River The Battle of Talas was a military engagement between the Arab Abbasid Caliphate along with their ally the Tibetan Empire against the Chinese Tang dynasty, governed at the time by Emperor Xuanzong. In July 751 AD, Tang and Abbasid forces met in the valley of the Talas River to vie for control of the Syr Darya region of central Asia. After a stalemate in several days of combat, the Tang lost the battle because the Karluks defected from the Tang side to the Abbasid side. The defeat marked the end of Tang westward territorial expansion, resulting in Muslim control of Transoxiana for the next four hundred years. Retrenchment of Tang influence post-763 In 755, the Tang dynasty was subject to the devastating Anshi Rebellion and lost much influence in Inner Asia, which came to be dominated by the Uyghurs. Tang influence and rule over the Northwestern regions, however, continued until the dynasty's fall in 907, at which time these areas were taken over by the Tanguts, who later established Xi Xia. =Tang-Uyghur relations= Although they now controlled most of the Mongolian region, the Uyghur Khans still maintained relatively cordial relations with the Tang dynasty, accepting many titles from the Tang emperors. in 788, the Uyghur Khan pleaded the Tang emperor to change the title of the Uyghurs from Huihe (ÂõûÁ¥á) to Huihu (ÂõûÈ∂ª). =Fall of the Uyghur Khanate= By the mid-800's, the power of the Uyghur Khanate was on the wane.

The Old Book of Tang recorded the first ever embassy from Tibet arrived in China from the Tibetan emperor Songtsen Gampo in the 8th Zhenguan year or 634 CE.Lee 1981, pp. 6-7 Tang chronicles describe this as a tribute mission, but it brought an ultimatum demanding an alliance through marriage, not subservient rituals.Powers 2004, pg. 31 When Emperor Taizong of Tang refused a marriage alliance, Songtsen Gampo sent an army to attack the Chinese frontier city of Songzhou in 638, which was the first military conflict between the rising Tibetan Empire and the Chinese Tang dynasty. After a Tang army inflicted heavy casualties on the Tibetans in a night-time attack, Songtsen Gampo withdrew. He sent emissaries and tributes to Tang capital Chang'an to apologize, and to again request marriage. Taizong decided to give Songtsen Gampo a distant niece, Princess Wencheng, in marriage. The peace held for the remainder of the reigns of Taizong and Songtsen Gampo, although Tibet would pose major military threats for most of the rest of the Tang period. In 763 AD, the Tibetans captured Chang'an in 763 during the midst of the Anshi Rebellion, which saw Tang China devastated by a massive Turkic uprising. However, the incursion was soon defeated.

A person dealing in trade of bunker fuel is called a Bunker Trader. The term originated in the days of steamships, when the fuel, coal, was stored in bunkers. Nowadays the term bunker is generally applied to the storage of petroleum products in tanks, and the practice and business of refueling ships. Bunkering operations are located at seaports, and they include the storage of \\"bunker\\" (ship) fuels and the provision of the fuel to vessels. Singapore is currently the largest bunkering port in the world. Bunkering in maritime law In many maritime contracts, such as charterparties, contracts for carriage of goods by sea, See the United States' Harter Act and marine insurance policies,Marine Insurance Act 1906 the shipowner or ship operator is required to ensure that the ship is \\"seaworthy\\". Seaworthiness requires not only that the ship be sound and properly crewed, but also that it be fully fuelled (or \\"bunkered\\") at the start of the voyage. The Hague‚ÄìVisby Rules Articles II & III If the ship operator wishes to bunker en route, this must be provided for in a written agreement, or the interruption of the voyage may be deemed to be deviation (a serious breach of contract). If the vessel runs out of fuel in mid-ocean, this is also serious breach, allowing the insurer to cancel a policy, Greenock Steamship Co v Marine Insurance [1903] 2 K.B. 657If the policy has a \\"held-covered\\" clause, the deviation will not allow immediate cancellation and allowing a consignee to make a cargo claim. It may also give rise to a salvage situation. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO), an agency of the United Nations (UN) responsible for the prevention of marine pollution by ships, enforced the MARPOL Annex VI on 1st January 2020 to minimise the environmental impact of bunkering. \\"Bunkering\\" as theft Particularly in Nigeria, \\"bunkering\\" also means the clandestine siphoning off or diverting of oil from pipelines and storage facilities. Such bunkering is often performed crudely, causing both accidents and pollution.

The incumbent President of Djibouti, Ismail Omar Guelleh, was re-elected to a second six- year term in an unopposed election. Background Hassan Gouled Aptidon was president of Djibouti from independence in 1977 until he stepped down in 1999. He had reintroduced multi-party democracy in 1992 under international pressure, but the 1999 presidential election saw Aptidon's nephew, Ismail Omar Guelleh, elected with 74% of the vote. The last parliamentary elections in 2003 saw Guelleh's political party, the Union for a Presidential Majority win all 65 seats in an election the opposition claimed saw significant rigging. Campaign The main opposition parties in Djibouti did not put up a candidate in the presidential election and called on their supporters to boycott the election. The only opposition candidate who had said they would stand in the election was Mohamed Daoud Chehem. However, on the 10 March 2005 he withdrew from the election as he said that he did not have enough money to take part in the election. A statement from one opposition party on the 18 March said that \\"change through the ballot box is almost impossible in the Republic of Djibouti\\". Despite having no opponents President Guelleh campaigned strongly in the run up to the election. He held rallies in the evenings and pledged to reduce poverty, increase women's rights and improve the transparency of the government. He also accused the opposition of being afraid to stand against him and said that he regretted having no opponent in the election. On the day of the election itself there was a protest against the election which was broken up by the police firing tear gas. The official news agency of Djibouti reported that there was a high turnout of over 70% of voters in the election, however members of the opposition said that this was incorrect. Results Aftermath Guelleh was sworn in as President for a second term on 9 May 2005 and pledged to increase economic development in Djibouti.

History Named after Invicta, the motto of the county of Kent, the ground was Arsenal's first proper stadium, being equipped with a stand, a row of terracing and changing rooms. The arena stood on the south side of Plumstead High Street with Arsenal's old home, the Manor Ground which was upon the opposite side of high street being much smaller by contrast. When Royal Arsenal first moved to the Invicta Ground, they were an amateur team with a following of only about 1,000, but within a year the club had turned professional and had renamed themselves Woolwich Arsenal. They started to attract much larger crowds, including a record 12,000 for a match against the then Scottish Cup holders Heart of Midlothian on 30 March 1891, which Woolwich Arsenal lost 5‚Äì1. Woolwich Arsenal intended to use the Invicta for 1893‚Äì94, their first season playing in the Football League. However, the ground's owner, George Weaver (a mineral water magnate), wishing to make the most out of the rise in Arsenal's fortunes, put the annual rent up from ¬£200 to ¬£350, a sum which the club could not afford. Arsenal returned to the Manor Ground, which they bought outright after a share issue, and spent the summer of 1893 building proper stands and facilities. An amateur side, Royal Ordnance Factories, set up in response to Woolwich Arsenal joining the League, played some home games in the Invicta Ground. However, they had left by late 1894 and Weaver could not find a permanent tenant for the ground. He eventually demolished it, building houses on the site. Today Mineral Street and Hector Street stand where the stadium used to be; some of the stadium's concrete terracing still survives in the back gardens of houses in Hector Street.

Life and work  Born in Salford, Lancashire, Richards graduated with a degree in geology in 1938 and then qualified as a housing manager, in which profession she worked until 1973. Carola began painting in her early forties, eventually taking early retirement and moving to Brighton, East Sussex to pursue her new-found passion for art full-time. She then studied painting, drawing and printmaking under Hayward Veal (1913‚Äì1968), Peter Richmond, George W. Hooper (1910‚Äì1994) and John Hardy Meadows (b. 1912). She continued to study drawing and painting for the rest of her life, exploring a wide variety of approaches and media along the way. Following early impressionistic work and a period of hard-edge abstraction, procuring influence of Avant-Garde art from the great war period; Cubism, Futurism and Vorticism, she progressed to a mature way of working resulting in a colourful exploration of figurative and imaginary subjects. As with Matisse, colour was Carola's primary interest and she achieved subtle and unusual relationships. Another side of her personality engendered strange images; colourful, whimsical, surreal, often bizarre; strange forms appeared as she worked over and over paintings going, as she said, in unforeseen directions and often surprising herself with the final results. She described the process of painting as 'frustrating, mysterious and exciting'. In 1997 Carola generously donated two oil paintings by Dennis Creffield to the Brighton Museum & Art Gallery Always curious about new ideas and processes, in her mid-eighties Richards decided to learn how to use a computer as a painting tool, and in 1999 her computer prints were exhibited in the Arundel exhibition. This exemplified her approach to life in general; she was always open to new ideas, excited by challenges and dogged in her pursuit of what she felt to be important. She never lost her childlike enthusiasm and her work reflected the freedom and imagination of an ever-young mind. As a person Richards was extremely sociable, caring and thoughtful; always strongly emotionally involved in the lives of her many friends. She travelled widely and learned several languages, most notably Russian, which she continued to study with great dedication until her death in 2004.  Exhibitions  Elected a member of the Eastbourne Group of artists in 1993, she exhibited widely, including at Brighton University 1975; University of Essex 1980; Tichbourne Studios, Brighton 1981; The London Group in 1982 & 1984; Towner Art Gallery, Eastbourne 1983; Royal College of Art, London 1984; Brighton Gallery of Fine Art 1987; Red Herring Gallery, Brighton 1989; Brighton Festival 1991; Albion Gallery, Lewes 1991 & 1992; Brighton Museum & Art Gallery 1995 & 1998; Arundel 1999, culminating in a large retrospective at the Towner Gallery, Eastbourne in 2006.

A large, three-engined, twin-boom biplane, the sole prototype Ganymede did not fly until after the war had ended, and although an attempt was made to convert the aircraft to an airliner, it was unsuccessful. Development and design In 1918, the Grahame-White Aviation Company of Hendon, London developed a large, long-range heavy bomber intended to equip the Royal Air Force. The resulting design, the E.IV Ganymede, was of unusual layout, being a three-engined, twin- boom biplane with four-bay wings.Grahame-White E.IV-Ganymede at aircraft- catalog.com Accessed 13 March 2017 Two of the engines were located at the front of the booms, driving tractor propellers, while the third engine was installed at the rear of the central nacelle, driving a pusher propeller. A biplane tail unit with three fins and rudders spanned the gap between the two main fuselage booms.Grahame-White E.IV-Ganymede at flyingmachines.ru Accessed 13 March 2017 The two pilots and a bomb-aimer/gunner were accommodated in the central nacelle, while additional gunners cockpits were provided in each of the fuselage booms, with Scarff ring mountings for a machine gun together with a tunnel opening under the fuselages to allow the gunners to repel attacks from below.Mason 1994, p.125.Bruce 1957, pp.264-265. It was intended that the Ganymede be powered by three 400 hp (298 kW) Liberty engine, but concerns about the availability of the American-built Liberty resulted in considerably less powerful Sunbeam Maori engines being specified when an order was placed for three prototypes. The first of these prototypes, serial number C3481 was completed late in 1918. While it was tested by the Air Ministry during 1919, the RAF had little interest in purchasing a new heavy bomber, and the remaining two prototypes were cancelled. After being damaged in a landing accident in 1919, Grahame-White rebuilt the Ganymede into a civil airliner, becoming the E.9 Ganymede. The central engine was removed completely, while the two remaining engines were replaced by 450 hp (336 kW) Napier Lions. The nacelle was rebuilt with two pilots in an open cockpit ahead of a glazed cabin housing 12 passengers. The modified aircraft was granted a Certificate of Airworthiness on 12 September 1919, with the Aircraft registration G-EAMW, but was destroyed in a fire in September 1920.Jackson 1973, p.317.

Function  Laminins, a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, are the major noncollagenous constituent of basement membranes. They have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling, neurite outgrowth and metastasis. Laminins are composed of 3 non identical chains: laminin alpha, beta and gamma (formerly A, B1, and B2, respectively) and they form a cruciform structure consisting of 3 short arms, each formed by a different chain, and a long arm composed of all 3 chains. Each laminin chain is a multidomain protein encoded by a distinct gene. Several isoforms of each chain have been described. Different alpha, beta and gamma chain isomers combine to give rise to different heterotrimeric laminin isoforms which are designated by Arabic numerals in the order of their discovery, i.e. alpha1beta1gamma1 heterotrimer is laminin 1. The biological functions of the different chains and trimer molecules are largely unknown, but some of the chains have been shown to differ with respect to their tissue distribution, presumably reflecting diverse functions in vivo. This gene encodes the gamma chain isoform laminin, gamma 3. The gamma 3 chain is most similar to the gamma 1 chain, and contains all the 6 domains expected of the gamma chain. It is a component of laminin 12. The gamma 3 chain is broadly expressed in skin, heart, lung, and the reproductive tracts. In skin, it is seen within the basement membrane of the dermoepidermal junction at points of nerve penetration. However, it was also found that the gamma 3 is a prominent element of the apical surface of ciliated epithelial cells of lung, oviduct, epididymis, ductus deferens, and seminiferous tubules. The distribution of gamma 3-containing laminins along ciliated epithelial surfaces suggests that the apical laminins are important in the morphogenesis and structural stability of the ciliated processes of these cells. A recent study found that LAMC3 plays a critical role in forming the convolution of the cerebral cortex. Particularly LAMC3 is expressed during the embryonic period, which contributes the formation of dentrites.Nature Genetics 2011; DOI: 10.1038/ng.836 References Further reading  * External links * * Category:Laminins ","title":"Laminin, gamma 3"},{"id":"21598742","text":"LAMB4 is a laminin gene.

Family Susan's family, the Whites of Hutton, were a cadet branch of the White family of South Warnborough, Hampshire.White, George (c.1530-84), of Hutton, Essex, History of Parliament Retrieved 1 May 2013. According to Loades, Susan was \\"probably the youngest\\". of the four children of Richard White of Hutton, Essex and Maud Tyrrell, the daughter of Sir William Tyrrell of Heron, Essex.; . She had two sisters, Mary, who first married a husband surnamed Whitehead and secondly a husband surnamed Spenser; and Joan, who married a husband surnamed Wilcocks;. and a brother, Richard White, who married Margaret Strelley, the daughter of Nicholas Strelley of Strelley, Nottinghamshire, by whom he had a son, George White (d. 14 June 1584).. Life At some time before 1534 she married Thomas Tonge, who on 2 June 1534 became Clarenceux King of Arms. He died less than two years later, in March 1536, naming her his sole executor and leaving her the residue of his estate. Despite the brevity of his tenure as Clarenceux King of Arms, Susan was known as Susan Clarencius for the remainder of her life.Porter, Linda (2007) Mary Tudor: The First Queen, p. 249. London: Little, Brown. She joined Princess Mary's household as a maid in waiting when Mary was sent to the Welsh Marches as heiress presumptive in 1525. She lost her position in 1533, because Mary's household was dissolved due to her refusal to acknowledge Anne Boleyn as her father's wife. When Mary's household was reinstated, after she succumbed to pressure by her father's officials in 1536, Susan returned to her service at Mary's request. By June 1536, Mary considered her a trusted servant, and their close personal relationship lasted for the remainder of Mary's life. After Mary's accession to the throne in 1553, Susan Clarencius was named Mistress of the Robes. She was regarded as the queen's closest confidante and received many gifts from her, including generous grants of land in Essex. When Mary was looking for a suitable husband in 1554, Clarencius spoke strongly in favour of Philip II of Spain. During Queen Mary's phantom pregnancy, Susan kept on assuring her that she was indeed with child, although she voiced strong doubts about her mistress's pregnancy to the French ambassador Antoine de Noailles. Susan had a reputation for being devious and greedy, as evidenced by a report by Venetian ambassador Giovanni Michieli, in which he states that she persuaded him to make a gift to Queen Mary of his coach and horses, which the queen subsequently gave to Susan. Susan survived her royal mistress. Following Queen Mary's death in 1558, she emigrated to Spain with another of Mary's former servants, Jane Dormer, the wife of Gomez Suarez de Figueroa of Cordova, 1st Duke of Feria, a friend of Philip of Spain's. As there is no further mention of her in the records after the spring of 1564, she probably died about that time while a member of Feria's household.Porter, p. 412 Little else is known of her life. Susan Clarencius apparently had no children, at least none that survived infancy.

Such problems include version conflicts, missing DLLs, duplicate DLLs, and incorrect or missing registration. In side-by-side, Windows stores multiple versions of a DLL in the subdirectory of the Windows directory, and loads them on demand. This reduces dependency problems for applications that include a side-by-side manifest. Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 and 2008 employ SxS with all C runtime libraries. However, runtime libraries in Visual C++ 2010 no longer use this technology; instead, they include the version number of a DLL in its file name, which means that different versions of one DLL will technically be completely different DLLs now.Section \\"Visual C++ Libraries\\" in Breaking Changes in Visual C++. Retrieved on 2010-09-10.See section \\"Differences between Visual C++ 2008 and Visual C++ 2010\\" in \\"Deployment in Visual C++ 2010\\". Retrieved on 2010-09-10. SxS is also the technological basis for registration-free COM activation. Only in-process COM servers may be activated this way.  Operation  An application that employs SxS must have a manifest. Manifests are typically a section embedded in the application's executable file but may also be an external file. When the operating system loads the application and detects the presence of a manifest, the operating system DLL loader is directed to the version of the DLL corresponding to that listed in the manifest. If there is no manifest, the DLL loader loads a default version of all DLL dependencies. If the DLL is a COM server, it must have a manifest of its own for registration-free activation to succeed. On Windows Vista and later, can help to diagnose failures in the starting of applications due to SxS misconfiguration. If a user wishes to override manifest-specified assemblies (for example, in the case of security patches applied to a library), a publisher configuration file can globally redirect assemblies. Digital signatures can ensure the legitimacy of such redirection.Publisher Configuration (Windows)  Manifest format  The application manifest is internally represented as XML. The URN associated with SxS manifests is \\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\\". Several other recent Microsoft technologies such as ClickOnce employ the same manifest format.  Example manifest  The following is an example of a manifest for an application that depends on a C runtime DLL.  Activation contexts  A manifest like the one above is parsed into an activation context by the SxS loader. There is a stack of activation contexts for each thread or fiber. An API allows programmatic manipulation of these contexts. It may be necessary for a library (DLL) to change its activation context, for example if it requires a specific version of another library for its own consumption instead of using the activation context of its caller. This type of issue is sometimes called (activation context) pollution. To prevent polluting its activation context, a DLL can have a manifest embedded as a resource, which is parsed when the DLL is loaded. This manifest must be at resource id 2 in the image file for the loader to find it.  WinSxS (Windows component store)  From Vista onward, the Windows operating system uses WinSxS for its core components. Operating system files in the directory are hard linked to from their usual locations in the Windows directory structure. A file in a subdirectory in may be linked from multiple locations (e.g. the directory and application directories). Windows Explorer double-counts the disk space occupied by these files. This can be demonstrated using the fsutil command- line program. Some third-party Explorer extensions to show the link count also exist. However, not all files from are projected this way to \\"live\\" operating system files. For example, after installing some Windows updates, old file versions replaced by the updates are still kept in although they are no longer linked in the \\"live\\" Windows directories. This allows updates to be uninstalled safely. Because of its elevated importance, from Vista onward the directory is owned by the Trusted Installer service SID. By default not even administrators can modify its contents (without taking ownership first). Uninstalling applications does not immediately free space in the directory; space for unused assemblies is garbage-collected over time by the Installer service. Although not officially documented, the algorithm for generating the directory names residing inside the directory has been made public on an MSDN Microsoft employee's blog. The algorithm was changed in the transition from XP to Vista. Windows 7 includes Windows AIK tool Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) which can remove files used by superseded OS updates using the Trusted Installer worker service, without the need to reboot or take down the system;Microsoft TechNet: What Is Deployment Image Servicing and Management? recent updates add Windows Update cleanup to the Disk Cleanup tool () and the downloadable System Update Readiness tool (CheckSUR)Microsoft TechNet: Advanced guidelines for diagnosing and fixing servicing corruption which can repair components store errors and replace corrupt or missing OS files with known good versions. Windows 8 integrates repair capability to the DISM tool which is now able to copy valid OS files from Windows Update or an offline WIM image, as well as reset the component store to only contain the latest versions of OS components. Windows 10 runs the automatic task to clean up the component store.  Advantages  * For applications that have been built with SxS, multiple applications may coexist that depend on different versions of the same DLL. This is in contrast to non-SxS DLL environments where an original DLL in a shared system folder may be overwritten by the subsequent installation of another program that depends on a different version of the same DLL. * The XML formatting of the manifest is human-legible and thus makes it easier for developers to determine the dependencies of an application and their versions.  Disadvantages  * In Windows XP, a bug in causes heap corruption, leading to application crashes. This issue is not fixed by any XP service pack. Users must manually install an appropriate update. * Considerably higher apparent disk space consumption, even though most of the contents of are just additional hard links to files that exist elsewhere. * The directory and Windows Update logs may become corrupted as they grow in size, because security updates add multiple new versions of critical system components to the store. In Windows Vista there is no supported way to significantly reduce the size of the directory.  Disk space  While the directory is extremely large and contains multiple versions of many files, there are some files elsewhere in the Windows folder (e.g. ) that are hardlinks to files in the directory. Thus, programs estimating the size of the Windows folder must be careful not to add the size of additional hard links to a file after one has already been counted. DIR and Explorer fail to check for hard links, and so may count the same file multiple times, adding incorrectly to the perceived disk usage. The disk usage reported by these two programs is as if each hard link is an actual file. Since Windows 8.1, the DISM tool can be used to analyze the component store and report its actual size.

As part of an actor's make-up, it is often used to make a person appear older.Delamar, p. 239. Bald caps are a versatile medium. They form the basis of many creative fantasy make-ups.Conway, p. 219. Bald caps may be purchased ready-made or be constructed on-site by a make-up artist, who applies several layers of liquid plastic (such as latex) to a pattern made by covering the actor's head in clingfilm. The finished cap is glued to the actor's head with spirit gum or surgical adhesive, and the edges of the cap are blended with the actor's skin using make-up techniques.Delamar, p. 245. Almost any colour medium can be applied to the bald cap to give it colour and texture for creating a bald look, to blending in with skin tones.Conway, p. 219. Bald caps used in the theatre are made of thicker rubber, intended to be put on and off rapidly and multiple times. Coarser and more unrealistic bald caps are sometimes also used as part of a clown costume. They may also be made of plastic.Conway, p. 223 Bald caps may also be used for occasions when an actor who has hair wishes to act as if they are wearing a wig to cover up their baldness. In this case, the actor will wear a bald cap with a wig on top; the wig can be removed to reveal the \\"baldness\\" beneath.

Functionally, it serves the same purposes as the K-nearest neighbors algorithm, and makes direct use of a related concept termed stochastic nearest neighbours.  Definition  Neighbourhood components analysis aims at \\"learning\\" a distance metric by finding a linear transformation of input data such that the average leave-one-out (LOO) classification performance is maximized in the transformed space. The key insight to the algorithm is that a matrix A corresponding to the transformation can be found by defining a differentiable objective function for A, followed by use of an iterative solver such as conjugate gradient descent. One of the benefits of this algorithm is that the number of classes k can be determined as a function of A, up to a scalar constant. This use of the algorithm therefore addresses the issue of model selection.  Explanation  In order to define A, we define an objective function describing classification accuracy in the transformed space and try to determine A^* such that this objective function is maximized. A^* = \\\\mbox{argmax}_A f(A)  Leave-one-out (LOO) classification  Consider predicting the class label of a single data point by consensus of its k-nearest neighbours with a given distance metric. This is known as leave-one-out classification. However, the set of nearest-neighbours C_i can be quite different after passing all the points through a linear transformation. Specifically, the set of neighbours for a point can undergo discrete changes in response to smooth changes in the elements of A, implying that any objective function f(\\\\cdot) based on the neighbours of a point will be piecewise-constant, and hence not differentiable.  Solution  We can resolve this difficulty by using an approach inspired by stochastic gradient descent. Rather than considering the k-nearest neighbours at each transformed point in LOO-classification, we'll consider the entire transformed data set as stochastic nearest neighbours. We define these using a softmax function of the squared Euclidean distance between a given LOO-classification point and each other point in the transformed space: p_{ij} = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{e^{-Ax_i - Ax_j^2}}{\\\\sum_k e^{-Ax_i - Ax_k^2}}, & \\\\mbox{if} j e i \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & \\\\mbox{if} j = i \\\\end{cases} The probability of correctly classifying data point i is the probability of classifying the points of each of its neighbours with the same class C_i: p_i = \\\\sum_{j \\\\in C_i} p_{ij} \\\\quad where p_{ij} is the probability of classifying neighbour j of point i. Define the objective function using LOO classification, this time using the entire data set as stochastic nearest neighbours: f(A) = \\\\sum_i \\\\sum_{j \\\\in C_i} p_{ij} = \\\\sum_i p_i Note that under stochastic nearest neighbours, the consensus class for a single point i is the expected value of a point's class in the limit of an infinite number of samples drawn from the distribution over its neighbours j \\\\in C_i i.e.: P(Class(X_i) = Class(X_j)) = p_{ij}. Thus the predicted class is an affine combination of the classes of every other point, weighted by the softmax function for each j \\\\in C_j where C_j is now the entire transformed data set. This choice of objective function is preferable as it is differentiable with respect to A (denote x_{ij} = x_i - x_j): \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial A} = - 2A \\\\sum_i \\\\sum_{j \\\\in C_i} p_{ij} \\\\left ( x_{ij} x_{ij}^T - \\\\sum_k p_{ik} x_{ik} x_{ik}^T \\\\right ) = 2A \\\\sum_i \\\\left ( p_i\\\\sum_k p_{ik}x_{ik}x_{ik}^T - \\\\sum_{j \\\\in C_i} p_{ij}x_{ij}x_{ij}^T \\\\right ) Obtaining a gradient for A means that it can be found with an iterative solver such as conjugate gradient descent. Note that in practice, most of the innermost terms of the gradient evaluate to insignificant contributions due to the rapidly diminishing contribution of distant points from the point of interest. This means that the inner sum of the gradient can be truncated, resulting in reasonable computation times even for large data sets.  Alternative formulation  \\"Maximizing f(\\\\cdot) is equivalent to minimizing the L_1-distance between the predicted class distribution and the true class distribution (ie: where the p_i induced by A are all equal to 1). A natural alternative is the KL-divergence, which induces the following objective function and gradient:\\" (Goldberger 2005) g(A) = \\\\sum_i \\\\log \\\\left ( \\\\sum_{j \\\\in C_i} p_{ij} \\\\right ) = \\\\sum_i \\\\log (p_i) \\\\frac{\\\\partial g}{\\\\partial A} = 2A \\\\sum_i \\\\left ( \\\\sum_k p_{ik} x_{ik} x_{ik}^T - \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{j \\\\in C_i} p_{ij} x_{ij} x_{ij}^T }{\\\\sum_{j \\\\in C_i} p_{ij}} \\\\right ) In practice, optimization of A using this function tends to give similar performance results as with the original.

The magazine was conceived as a reaction to what co-founders Darren Reynolds and David Lubich saw as the failure of the mainstream music press to cover the growth of an underground dance music scene in the UK. This went beyond the music itself to the fashions, warehouse parties and subcultures that were finding their feet at the time. From the outset, Soul Underground sought to cover a wide range of music ‚Äì from the burgeoning \\"Rare Groove\\" scene of the late 1980s, though rap, electro, house to reggae and soul. It quickly gained a reputation for its provocative features and news reports, and its interest in writing about music from a historical and even political perspective. Its perceived credibility among musicians, club and radio DJs and journalists meant that it was able to attract a very strong team of writers and photographers. The magazine was founded as a fanzine: its first issue had a print run of just 850 copies,Needs, Kris, Review of Catch the Beat: \\"Historians strike again with seminal fanzine highlights\\", Record Collector, 2011. and was distributed through record shops. Sales grew quickly, leading to a disagreement between Reynolds and Lubich over the direction the magazine should take (Reynolds wanted to preserve its \\"fanzine\\" ethos, while Lubich believed that it could evolve into a \\"proper\\" magazine without compromising its independence and credibility). Reynolds left the magazine at issue 7, leaving Lubich as publisher and editor. As dance music made the move from underground scene to huge commercial success, Soul Underground saw its sales and profile rise. National newsagent distribution followed in late 1989, as did limited distribution through record and clothing stores in New York. In early 1990, Soul Underground gained a presence in New York ‚Äì both in terms of sales and editorial coverage. It appointed as New York editor Leonard Abrams, former editor of the East Village Eye, who built a roster of writers and photographers and helped the magazine stay on top of the city's burgeoning hip-hop scene.  Notable firsts  Soul Underground‚Ä≤s network of music and culture obsessives gave it an edge in reporting on a number of hugely influential developments. It was the first magazine to cover the \\"Bristol Scene\\", ran the first major interview with A Guy Called Gerald and championed the emergence of a new generation of black comedians, including Angie Le Mar.  A career launchpad  Although Soul Underground employed a number of established journalists, it gained a reputation for its \\"open door\\" policy and for an ability to spot and nurture talent. A passion for music was more important than formal journalistic skills. In this way, the magazine proved to be something of a career launch pad. Some of the writers, artists, photographers and DJs associated with the magazine stayed within the media, while others moved into music and fashion. Although critically successful and intermittently profitable, Soul Underground was under-capitalized and unable to cope financially with the sudden drop in ad revenue that occurred around the end of 1990. Unable to secure financial backing, Lubich was forced to close Soul Underground in January 1991.  Anthology: Catch The Beat  An anthology entitled Catch the Beat: The best of Soul Underground 1987‚Äì91 was published by Djhistory.com in October 2010.amazon.co.uk listing for 'Catch The Beat' The hardcover, 440-page book contains a selection of features, interviews, charts and news stories from each of Soul Underground‚Ä≤s 38 issues. Catch The Beat has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from music magazines including Mojo and Record Collector, and from DJs including Greg Wilson, who has written about it at his blog.

Plot The book begins a few months after the September 11th terrorist attacks on the United States, with John Wells, an undercover CIA agent, in the middle of a battle in Afghanistan. Wells has been undercover with Al Qaeda for many years, fighting in Chechnya, Afghanistan and Pakistan. During the battle he and his crew of Al-Qaeda members are on a hillside where a group of United States Marines are stationed. The small Al-Qaeda band is planning to attack the Marines to help with a bigger battle that is raging below, and Wells decides to take out the terrorists himself so he can send a message to his CIA contact via the Marines: \\"No prior knowledge of 9/11. Say hi to Heather for me.\\" Meanwhile, back in the United States, Jennifer Exley, his CIA handler, visits a prisoner of war being held on a Navy ship to try to get information on Wells, who has been incommunicado for two years. Al Qaeda detonates two truck bombs in LA, killing hundreds of people. John Wells is returned to the USA on a mission from Al Qaeda where he reconnects with the CIA. However, due to the length of his absence he is accused of being ‚Äúun- faithful‚Äù because he did not warn the US about Al Qaeda attacks. The accuser, Vinny Duto forces John to take a polygraph test. He proves himself to be innocent. Wells is put in a CIA safe house in Washington, DC but escapes in order to continue his Al Qaeda mission. He heads to Atlanta and spends several months hiding out before being given the task of killing a retired US Army general. After completing this task, and secretly killing his two fellow Al Qaeda members, he is given the task of collecting something from Canada. While in Canada, he meets with an Al-Qaeda member to collect a suitcase, really a scientist who has been working to grow the plague bacteria. Wells returns with the suitcase but has secretly been infected with the plague by the scientist. Wells then learns that Al Qaeda used the LA bombings as a distraction from an impending, much larger attack; several other Al Qaeda members have infected themselves with the plague and plan to spread it throughout the population, creating a pandemic within the United States. Wells, with the help of Exley, is able to kill the infected terrorists and take out their leader, Khadri, thwarting their plans.

It was a revision of a 1934 poem called Looney. The poet W. H. Auden thought it Tolkien's finest poem. It has been related to the Celtic immram tradition of tales and medieval dream vision poetry. The scholar of English literature Verlyn Flieger calls the poem \\"a cry of longing for lost beauty\\", and relates it to the sense of alienation many of Tolkien's generation felt on returning from the First World War. Background The work is based on an earlier poem entitled \\"Looney\\", which Tolkien had published in The Oxford Magazine in 1934.Tom Shippey. Michael D. C. Drout, J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment, Routledge, 2013, pp 515-517. The 1962 version of the poem is considerably darker than, and twice as long as, the earlier version. Tolkien was initially reluctant to include the work in the collection, feeling that it was out of keeping with the other poems.Verlyn Flieger, A Question of Time: J.R.R. Tolkien's Road to Fa√´rie, The Kent State University Press, 1997, p. 208. Although \\"Looney\\" was composed long before Tolkien began work on The Lord of the Rings, the 1962 version is subtitled \\"Frodos Dreme\\". Tolkien's mock- academic introduction to the collection suggests that, although the poem may not have been composed by Frodo Baggins, it was associated with him by its readers and reflects the dark dreams that plagued him in his final days in the Shire. Narrative The poem is a first person narrative by a speaker who is never identified in the main body of the poem. Tolkien's rhyme scheme and metre are highly elaborate. \\"The Sea-Bell\\" opens with the speaker coming across a white shell \\"like a sea-bell\\" as he walks by the shore. He hears the sound of distant harbours and seas as he holds the shell in his hand. Suddenly a boat appears and he is borne away \\"to a forgotten strand in a strange land./ In the twilight beyond the deep\\". The land he arrives in is glittering, beautiful and mysterious. He hears the sound of distant music, voices and footfalls, but when he seeks the source of the sound the mysterious inhabitants of the land flee from him. Climbing onto a mound he presumptuously names himself king of the land, and challenges its people to come forth. Darkness descends upon him and he falls to the ground, blinded and bent. For a year and a day afterwards he dwells in the wood \\"wandering in wit\\" and growing grey and old. Eventually, broken and weary, he seeks out the sea and boards a ship that will take him back to his own land. However, when he arrives home the sea-bell no longer carries sounds from over the sea to him. The poem ends on a note of anguish as the speaker finds himself alienated from his own world, misunderstood and forsaken by those he once knew. The final image is of the narrator walking along a dark, rainy street talking to himself \\"for still they speak not, men that I meet\\". Themes and reception The poem has been related to the Celtic immram and the voyage of the Irish monk Saint Brendan (pictured). The poem touches on many themes which are recurrent in Tolkien's work: mortality, the otherworld, alienation, desire, suffering, pride, the sea and nature. The poet W. H. Auden wrote to Tolkien, telling him he considered it his \\"finest\\" poetic work, and called it \\"wonderful\\"; Tolkien replied that the praise \\"really made me wag my tail\\". Norma Roche writes that the poem, along with \\"The Last Ship\\", are both full of regret for the loss of the Blessed Realm, and relates them to the Celtic immram tradition of tales about a hero's sea journey to the Otherworld; she notes indeed that Tolkien wrote a 1955 poem called Imram about the voyage of the Irish monk Saint Brendan. Michael D. C. Drout suggests that the poem that follows it in The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, \\"The Last Ship\\", is a companion piece. Other scholars have noted that Tolkien wrote a series of works featuring Irish Otherworld voyages, including his childhood Roverandom and the later \\"Bilbo's Last Song\\". The scholar of English literature Verlyn Flieger calls the poem \\"a cry of longing for lost beauty\\", and relates the poem to the sense of alienation many of Tolkien's generation felt on returning from the First World War, but notes that it differs from many literary responses to the war by operating 'in the fantastic mode, rather than the realistic'. She has also argued that the final association of \\"The Sea-Bell\\" with Frodo gives the poem considerably more depth than it had in its 1934 recension and adds much to our understanding of the central character of The Lord of the Rings. The revised poem mentions \\"gladdon-swords\\", leaves of the yellow iris, an ominous echo of Isildur's death in the Gladden Fields that led ultimately to the War of the Ring. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey calls the addition of the subtitle \\"Frodos Dreme\\" to the poem, and the fictional editorial introduction, a \\"striking revision\\", because it attached the poem as a piece of imaginary prehistory of Hobbits, making them originally mariners, rather than the \\"Earth-fast\\" beings they otherwise are in Middle-earth. He notes the \\"increasing darkness\\" in the poem's revision, along with a mention of \\"gladdon-swords\\" (the blade-like leaves of the waterside yellow iris): an ominous mention, as Isildur, the man who cut the One Ring from the Dark Lord's hand, died in the Gladden Fields. In Shippey's view, however, a bigger change is that the revision makes the speaker seem guilty, apparently because he presumed to call himself \\"king\\"; and that guilt changes the end of the poem, from still having a shell with the voice of the sea, to a \\"silent and dead\\" one. The change goes with a ban on returning to Faery, just as the subtitle \\"Frodos Dreme\\" is a reminder of Frodo's final sense of loss and defeat in The Lord of the Rings. Shippey suggests that Tolkien, too, had come to doubt his theory of \\"sub-creation\\", which held that since creativity came from God, literary creation too was ultimately from God; but \\"by the 1960s, ... he no longer imagined himself rejoining his own creations after death, like Niggle; he felt they were lost, like the Silmarils. Sue Bridgwater compares the poem to W. B. Yeats's 1891 poem \\"The Man who Dreamed of Faeryland\\", with Dream Vision narrative and Faery as references. Both, she writes, place the realm of Faery on an island across the western sea, with trees or forests; as in Tolkien's forested Elvish land of Lothl√≥rien, time passes differently in \\"The Sea-Bell\\". Compared to \\"Looney\\", the poem is twice as long, and, she notes, both Flieger and Shippey find it \\"darker and more despairing\\", attributes true also of Yeats's poem. Both Tolkien and Yeats were dissatisfied with the poems. Both, Bridgwater states, bring out the otherworldly with words suggesting light and shade: Tolkien with \\"stars\\", \\"white\\", \\"glimmer\\", \\"glitter\\", \\"gleaming\\"; Yeats with \\"silver\\" and \\"gold\\" in each of his first three verses, words that Tolkien uses once each. Where Tolkien uses positive, even romantic images of nature, with \\" green-ness, water, heart's ease, flowers, star, river, animals and birds\\", Yeats uses lowly, even disgusting organisms: dead fish, a lugworm, knot-grass, worms. Both open with a collision of the known and unknown worlds, Tolkien's \\"I walked by the sea\\", Yeats's different in each verse, as in \\"He wandered by the sands\\" or \\"He mused beside the well\\". Both are vague as to where the Otherland might be; and in both, the dream turns to nightmare. Bridgwater writes that the theme of vanishing Faery is traditional, and that Tolkien used it not just in The Sea-Bell (lines 53ff) but in The Hobbit where the Hobbit and Dwarves, lost in the great forest of Mirkwood, try vainly to approach the Elves, just as the medieval Sir Orfeo sees the King of Elfland's hunt go past at a distance: being lost in a haunted forest poetically parallels being out of one's mind.

The company is based in Bellevue, Washington. Valve's first game was Half-Life, a first-person shooter released in 1998. It received universal acclaim and sold over nine million retail copies. Alongside Half-Lifes launch, Valve released development tools to enable the player community to create content and mods. The company then proceeded to hire the creators of popular mods, such as Counter-Strike, which became the most popular multiplayer first-person shooter for the next decade. Valve continued their trend of developing predominantly first-person video games in the 2000s with a number of critically successful releases. In 2004, they released the highly anticipated sequel Half-Life 2 through their own digital distribution service Steam. The game sold over 10 million copies and was met with acclaim. Valve released two subsequent episodes for Half-Life 2 and later packaged those games together with the puzzle game Portal and the multiplayer shooter Team Fortress 2 in a collection known as The Orange Box. By the end of 2008, combined retail sales of the Half-Life series, Counter- Strike series and The Orange Box had surpassed 32 million units. Newell also projected that digital sales of Valve's games would eventually exceed retail sales as Steam continued to grow. In the late 2000s, Valve released two zombie-themed first-person shooters focusing on cooperative gameplay with the Left 4 Dead series. The company continued to release multiplayer games with the launches of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Dota 2, both of which have large esports communities fostered by Valve. During the 2010s, Valve began focusing on supporting their established multiplayer games with regular content updates. In the late 2010s, Valve began investing in virtual reality and started to develop games and other software that make use of the technology, such as Half-Life: Alyx. Valve is considered to be one of the most important and influential companies in the gaming industry. The reception of their games, along with the creation of Steam, has prompted some publications to list Valve as one of the top game developers of all time, and the most powerful company in PC gaming. In 2013, Newell received a BAFTA Fellowship award with the BAFTA Games Committee recognizing the impact Valve had left on the gaming industry in producing critically and commercially successfully game franchises.  Games   Canceled and unreleased games  Several games announced by Valve as being in development have since been put on hold indefinitely or cancelled. They include:  Unreleased Half-Life games  * Half-Life: Hostile Takeover ‚Äì An expansion pack for the original Half-Life developed by 2015, Inc., reportedly cancelled in 2000. Valve filed a trademark for \\"Hostile Takeover\\" in 2001, only to let it expire in 2004. * Half-Life 2: Episode Three ‚Äì Announced in 2006 with a tentative release date of late 2007, this game was supposed to continue the story from Half-Life 2: Episode Two. Episode Three missed its release date and Valve had stopped discussing the project by the early 2010s, leading the press to label it as vaporware. Valve finally broke the silence on Episode Three in 2020, where they stated that it had been cancelled due to a combination of scope creep, unsatisfactory internal experiments, and the desire to develop the Source 2 engine first. * Untitled Half-Life 2 episode ‚Äì In November 2005, Junction Point Studios announced that it was working with Valve on a game. In April 2015, Junction Point's founder Warren Spector revealed the project was an episode for Half- Life 2. Development on the game ceased when Junction Point signed a deal with Disney Interactive Studios to develop Epic Mickey. Valve took Junction Point's project and passed its development on to Arkane Studios. * Ravenholm ‚Äì Also known as Return to Ravenholm or Half-Life 2: Episode Four, this game was in development by Arkane Studios around 2006‚Äì2007, however Valve decided not to take the project forward. In 2012, Valve writer Marc Laidlaw confirmed rumors surrounding the project's existence, and screenshots of gameplay emerged in 2013. In 2020, a Noclip documentary revealed much more about the project, including that Adrian Shephard from Opposing Force would have been the player character and that Father Grigori from Half-Life 2 would have played a supporting role. * Half-Life 3 ‚Äì A version of Half-Life 3 was in development on the Source 2 engine from 2013 to 2014. Valve planned to incorporate procedurally generated levels alongside a \\"crafted experience\\" so that no two playthroughs of the game would be exactly the same. It was cancelled when it became clear that Source 2 was not yet stable enough to support full-scale game development. * Borealis ‚Äì A virtual reality game headed by Marc Laidlaw that was in development in 2015. It would have been set aboard the titular ship as it travelled backwards and forwards through time. Development was cancelled as the project failed to gain enough momentum at Valve.  Others  * Untitled submarine game ‚Äì One of Valve's earliest game ideas was for a submarine game, with Valve co-founder Mike Harrington seeing an opportunity to create \\"fantastic underwater visuals and gameplay\\". It is unknown whether it ever advanced beyond the conceptual stage. * Prospero ‚Äì A third-person exploration game with a science fantasy theme. The project was in development at the same time as Half-Life. Prosperos development team transitioned to work on Half-Life, which had gained more traction. * Untitled role-playing game (I) ‚Äì A fantasy, action role-playing game about fairies that was in a prototype phase and cancelled prior to Left 4 Dead release. * The Crossing ‚Äì A first- person shooter developed in collaboration with Arkane Studios. The project was announced in 2007 and put on hold in May 2009. * Stars of Blood ‚Äì A space pirate game. In November 2012, Newell revealed the project's name and confirmed that it was no longer in development. * Left 4 Dead 3 ‚Äì An open- world sequel to Left 4 Dead 2 that was set in Morocco. It was cancelled when it became clear that the Source 2 engine was not yet ready to support full- scale game development. ** Hot Dog ‚Äì Another attempt at creating a Left 4 Dead game, codenamed so that eagle-eyed fans would not know what it was in the event that its name was leaked to the public. * Untitled role-playing game (II) ‚Äì A fantasy RPG that was inspired by The Elder Scrolls, Dark Souls, and Monster Hunter series. It was at one point resurrected as a single-player RPG about the Dota 2 character Axe before it was shelved again. * A.R.T.I. ‚Äì A lighthearted voxel-based game that allowed for open-ended creation and destruction in a vein similar to Minecraft. It was resurrected as a VR game but shelved again when Half-Life: Alyx eclipsed its development. * SimTrek ‚Äì A virtual reality game developed primarily by the creators of Kerbal Space Program. It was shelved during the development of Half-Life: Alyx. * In the Valley of Gods ‚Äì A period adventure game set in 1920s Egypt developed by Campo Santo, a studio acquired by Valve in 2018. It was put on hold in late 2019, with the game's designers shifting to other Valve projects.

Biography Son of Ab√≠lio da Silva Bu√≠√ßa, parish priest of Vinhais, and Maria Barroso. Bu√≠√ßa married twice: the first lasted from 1896 to 1898, and his second, to Herm√≠nia Augusta da Costa, with whom he had two children (Elvira and Manuel). Manuel Bu√≠√ßa had few friends, outside his professional acquaintances, although he was a close colleague of Alfredo Lu√≠s da Costa and Aquilino Ribeiro (the latter of whom he referred to in his last testament by name), with whom he mingled at the Caf√© Gelo in the Rossio. His professional career started with his conscription into the army, where he would achieve the status of second Sergeant, and hold the title of field instructor in shooting, while at the Cavalry Regiment in Bragan√ßa. A professional, Bu√≠√ßa also enrolled in the master-at-arms training course, obtaining a medal for first class sharpshooting medallion in the process. Unfortunately, his career in the military was not spotless: there were various infractions and three disciplinary notes in his record. After the army, Bu√≠√ßa enrolled in courses at the Col√©gio Nacional, and participated in lessons in music and French. Elevator coup On the night of 28 January 1908 several men were arrested by the police around the Lisbon Municipal Library Elevator.The Library Elevator, which no longer exists, was a pedestrian elevator similar to the Elevator in Santa Justa used to transport people vertically from the Pra√ßa do Munic√≠pio (then referred to as the Largo do Pelourinho) and the Largo da Biblioteca in Lisboa. This group of people were later determined to be the principal revolutionaries in an attempted republican coup that was to have effectively occurred on January 28, 1908, but failed. The Janeirada (which colloquially means the January thing), or more commonly referred to as the Municipal Library Elevator Coup, was an attempted coup to assassinate Jo√£o Franco, proclaim a republic, and abolish the monarchy (by this, its King, Carlos I of Portugal). A cell of 20 men, led by Alfredo Lu√≠s da Costa, that also included Manuel Bu√≠√ßa, originally were to assault the Royal Palace, but later, strategically modified their assault to the Quartel dos L√≥ios, and attacked contingents of the Municipal Guard, around the Rua de Santa B√°rbara, until they received word of the revolution (from a particular mortar explosion). The Janeirada was planned by members of the Portuguese Republican Party, their enforcers, the Formiga Branca, elements of the Progressive Dissidency Party and the Carbon√°ria, the latter two providing financing, men and arms. In addition to Ant√≥nio Jos√© de Almeida, there was support from the shadows from Luz de Almeida, the chief of the Carbon√°ria Lusitana, Machado Santos and Ant√≥nio Maria da Silva. The decision to murder the King, was not clear, but these instructions were passed on to Costa's group, as part of the coup plans.Jorge Morais, 2007, pp. 123‚Äì126 But, the plans were shelved immediately when, tipped-off by police, Jo√£o Franco's government began rounding-up the usual suspects in militant republican circles. Those that could escape, did so, while others congregated around S√£o Juli√£o's Elevator and were rounded-up by the police en masse. In fact, the limits were limited to the higher-echelon members and leaders of the anti- monarchist movement, while lower level dissidents and thugs were limited to attacks in the Rato, in Alc√¢ntara, in the Campo de Santana, and along the Rua da Escola Polit√©cnica (where one officer was killed). The back room of the Caf√© Gelo, then a popular meeting place for republican and Carbon√°ria sympathizers, was empty in the following days, except for Manuel Bu√≠√ßa and Alfredo Costa who had escaped the sweep and were not afraid to be seen.  Assassination  On the morning of 1 February 1908, Manuel Bu√≠√ßa met with Alfredo Lu√≠s da Costa and other Carbon√°ria in Quinta do Xex√©, in Olivais, where they finalized the regicide of King Carlos I of Portugal.From the version recounted by Fabricio de Lemos, one of the assassins, to Ant√≥nio de Albuquerque in A execu√ß√£o do Rei Carlos, although most of the plan was decided, the meeting was used to finalize and adjust their details. This was particularly important since many of the higher-ranking members of the conspiracy had been arrested during the post-Elevator Coup round-up. Around two in the afternoon, Bu√≠√ßa had lunch with Costa and three other conspirators in the corner of the Caf√© Gelo. Near the kitchen, the nook allowed members to converse unnoticed. At the end of their conversations, Bu√≠√ßa got up, mentioning that he was going to \\"get the wand\\", which likely referred to his Winchester 1907 semi-automatic carbine (serial 2137), which had been exported from Germany by Heitor Ferreira. By four in the afternoon, Bu√≠√ßa, Domingos Ribeiro, and Jos√© Maria Nunes positioned themselves in the Terreiro do Pa√ßo, near the statute of King Joseph I and near a tree in front of the Ministry of the Kingdom, alongside a kiosk. Costa, de Lemos, and Ximenes assumed positions below the arcade of the Ministry, and mingled with the population gathered for the king's arrival by boat. At about 17:20, as the landau rounded the square, Bu√≠√ßa advanced from his position, and from 8‚Äì10 metres behind the carriage, he dropped to one knee and fired the first shot. His aim was perfect: the bullet hit Carlos I in the neck, immediately snapping his spine and effectively killing him. His second shot only guaranteed the king's death, but may have been directed to the young Prince Royal seated in front of the King.Castro Henriques, et.al., p. 231 This second shot clipped the epaulette on the left shoulder of the King, and caused the king to slump to the right. At this time Alfredo Costa jumped on the landau and firing two shots into the back of the king. Bu√≠√ßa moved in and fired at Lu√≠s Filipe as the latter was confronting Costa; the first bullet missed, but the second hit him in the face, exiting the cranium. Bui√ßa however, was not finished, and attempted to move position for another volley, when he was interrupted by Henrique da Silva Valente, a soldier of the 12th Infantry, who was in the square. By then a cavalry officer, Lieutenant Francisco Figueira fired on Bu√≠√ßa, hitting him in the leg. As Bu√≠√ßa attempted to flee, Figueira immobilized him with a shot to the thigh. A police officer finally killed Bu√≠√ßa in the square.  Afterward Manuel Bu√≠√ßa was buried on 11 February 1908; three men, members of the Associa√ß√£o do Registo Civil (English: Association of the Civil Registry) had protested outside the morgue, in order to convince the director to allow them to have a civil funeral. Earlier that day, the autopsy found: a contusion at the top of the cranium, a laceration in his lower back (likely caused by Lieutenant Figueiro's sabre) and a wound to the left breast. This wound was the fatal entry, the bullet clipped the heart and perforated the liver.Castro Henriques, et.al., pp. 240‚Äì241 The recovered bullet was a 6.35 caliber bullet from an automatic pistol, a weapon that was not used by the Portuguese police at the time, fueling speculation that some para-military personnel had killed him. In the afternoon, his body, along with that of Alfredo Lu√≠s da Costa and an innocent bystander (Jos√© Sabino), was taken to the cemetery in the Alto de S√£o Jo√£o. The two assassins' bodies were buried in graves 6044 and 6045, but in 1914, they were exhumed and placed in the local mausoleum. Shortly after their burial, permission was given by the acclamation government of Ferreira do Amaral to allow republican sympathizers to visit the graves. These events were organized by the Associa√ß√£o do Registo Civil, which furnished flowers and paid (500 r√©is per person and 200 r√©is per child) for those that appeared at the graves.Marquis de Rio Maior, 1930 After the 5 October Revolution ushered in a republican government, the Associa√ß√£o do Registo Civil acquired a plot in the cemetery and erected a monument to \\"the heroic liberators of the Fatherland\\". The monument was eventually dismantled during the Estado Novo, but its elements were never destroyed, but preserved and never replaced. Around six months before the regicide of King Carlos I and Prince Lu√≠s Filipe, Manuel Bu√≠√ßa had become a widower, and his children, ages seven and four years, would be left with their maternal grandmother. There is a belief, primarily in republican circles, that Bu√≠√ßa was an idealist, whose assassination of the King and Prince Royal was accomplished as a form of justice and honourable duty for the Fatherland.Carlos Esperan√ßa, 2007 In his final will, dated 28 January 1908, four days before the Lisbon Regicide, he wrote the following: > \\"Manuel dos Reis da Silva Bui√ßa, widower, son of Augusto da Silva Bui√ßa and > Maria Barroso, resident of Vinhais, concelho of Vinhais, district of > Bragan√ßa.

Parasoft DTP Parasoft DTP is a hub for development testing that was released in 2003 under the name Parasoft Concerto. In 2012, DTP won the \\"Best of Show\\" Embeddy award from VDC Research. DTP collects data from various software development activities such as testing, static analysis, code coverage, and metrics as well as integrating with other SDLC systems such as bug-tracking, peer review, and requirements. The data collected is used to create detailed reports on software quality as well as compliance with a variety of industry standards like FDA, MISRA, DO-178b/c. It also supports security standards such as CERT, OWASP, and CWE. The security reports include data from the standard risk frameworks like the ‚ÄúCommon Weakness Risk Analysis Framework‚Äù from CWE that help measure the so- called technical impact of a finding. This means that instead of simply reporting a software defect like a buffer overflow, the data include information about what kinds of security problems can occur from an overflow, such as exposure of private data or DDoS. This information helps developers and security testers prioritize which findings are most important. In addition to reporting and dashboards, DTP has an analytics engine called ‚ÄúProcess Intelligence Engine‚Äù or ‚ÄúPIE‚Äù. Users can take advantage of pre-build analytics modules for tasks like change-based testing. They can also use a graphical tool in the web interface to create their own analytics.

It is used to quantify the ability of pathogenic bacteria to invade eukaryotic cells. The assay is based on several observations made in the 1970s, in which the ability of internalized bacteria to avoid killing by antibiotics was reported. The assay started to be used in biological research in the early 1980s.  Background and principle  Intracellular bacteria need to enter host cells (cells of the infected organism) in order to replicate and propagate infection. Many species of Shigella (causes bacillary dysentery), Salmonella (typhoid fever), Mycobacterium (leprosy and tuberculosis) and Listeria (listeriosis), to name but a few, are intracellular. Several antibiotics cannot penetrate eukaryotic cells. Therefore, these antibiotics cannot hurt intracellular bacteria that are already internalized. Using such antibiotics enables us to differentiate between bacteria that succeed in penetrating eukaryotic cells and those that do not. Applying such an antibiotic to a culture of eukaryotic cells infected with bacteria would kill the bacteria that remain outside the cells while sparing the ones that penetrated. The antibiotic of choice for this assay is the aminoglycoside gentamicin.  Procedure  The chemical structure of gentamicin HeLa cells are commonly used as eukaryotic cells in the gentamicin protection assay, but other cells can be used as well. As for bacteria, only species susceptible to gentamicin can be assayed. The assay is performed in plastic microtiter plates, which are commonly used in laboratories for culturing eukaryotic cells. The cells are allowed to grow in the wells overnight, creating a flat layer. Bacteria are separately grown overnight. On the next day the eukaryotic cells are inoculated with the bacteria and are incubated together for an hour. Centrifuging the plates for a few minutes may help bring cells and bacteria in contact and initiate infection. After infection gentamicin is added to the plates, and they are incubated for an hour, allowing the antibiotic to kill all bacteria that were not able to penetrate the cells and remained outside. The plates are then washed well to remove the dead bacteria. Next the eukaryotic cells are lysed using a detergent, most commonly Triton X-100. The bacteria that penetrated the cells and remained alive are now released, and they are plated on solid medium plates. Counting the colonies formed on the plates on the next day, and knowing how many bacteria were used in the beginning of the assay, enables the researcher to calculate the percentage of bacteria that were able to invade the eukaryotic cells.  Usage, advantages and caveats  The gentamicin protection assay is commonly used in pathogen research. The contribution of specific genes or proteins to the bacteria's ability to invade cells can be easily assayed using this method. The gene in question can be knocked out, and the bacteria's invasiveness compared with that of normal, wild type bacteria. Environmental conditions, such as pH level and temperature, can also be assayed for their effect on invasiveness. The gentamicin protection assay is very sensitive, as it can detect the internalization of even single bacteria. It has several drawbacks: * Gentamicin can sometimes penetrate eukaryotic cells and kill the internalized bacteria. This may happen if the permeability of the cells somehow increased during the assay, sometimes due to poor handling of the cells. * Internalized bacteria may sometimes not be entirely protected from the outside environment, such as when the phagosome (the vacuole surrounding the bacterium inside the cell) is defective in some way. Gentamicin may kill those bacteria. * Gentamicin may fail to kill all the bacteria that remained outside the cells. To help assess the accuracy of a particular assay, positive and negative controls should be performed. When performing the assay as described above, bacteria that are known to be entirely invasive (positive control) and bacteria that are known as non- invasive (negative control) should be included in the assay. An alternative invasion assay is the differential immunostaining assay, based on the binding of antibodies to bacteria before and after invasion. The antibodies emit fluorescent, colored light, and the results of this assay are viewed under the microscope.

In an Islamic context it can refer to spreading corruption on Earth or spreading mischief in a Muslim land,Oliver Leaman (2013), Controversies in Contemporary Islam, Routledge, , Chapter 9 moral corruption against God,Oliver Leaman (2009), Islamic Philosophy, , pp. 140-141 or disturbance of the public peace.Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture, Editors: Coeli Fitzpatrick and Adam Hani Walker, , p. 59 The spread of fasad is a major theme in the Quran, and the notion is often contrasted with islah (setting things aright). Classical Quranic commentators commonly interpreted \\"corruption in the land\\" as open disobedience against God or its result. In certain contexts, classical jurists took it to refer to the legal category of Hirabah, comprising armed assault, rape and murder. Some contemporary Muslims view destruction of the natural environment to be among the central meanings of verses referring to fasad. In recent decades, the term has been used in the legal codes of the Islamic Republics of Pakistan and Iran. In Iran, laws referencing it have been used to prosecute or threaten political opposition figures. In Islamic scripture Quran The spread of fasad is a major theme in the Quran, and the notion is often contrasted with islah (setting things aright). Terms derived from the verbal root f-s-d appear in a number of Quranic verses. The verb afsad (to cause fasad) appears, for example, in chapter 2 (Al-Baqara), verse 11-12, > When it is said to them: \\"Make not mischief on the earth,\\" they say: \\"Why, > we only Want to make peace!\\" Of a surety, they are the ones who make > mischief, but they realise (it) not. ‚Äì Classical Quranic commentators commonly interpreted spreading \\"corruption in the land\\" or \\"mischief on the earth\\" as open disobedience against God or its result. Some contemporary Muslims view destruction of the natural environment to be among the central meanings of these verses. In chapter 5 (Al-Ma'ida) of Qur'an, verse 33 contains the expression \\"to strive mischievously in the land\\" (yas'awna fi-l-ardi fasadan): > The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and > strive to spread corruption through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, > or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the > land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs > in the Hereafter. ‚Äì The scope of this verse has been limited by most classical commentators to the armed crimes falling under the legal category of Hirabah, which comprises armed robbery, assault (including rape), and murder, particularly of innocent travelers on the road. A \\"small minority\\" viewed this verse as applying to apostates in general. This verse follows verses 26-31 which refer to the incident in which Qabil (Cain), son of Adam, killed his brother Habil (Abel). Those who cause mischief in the land (yufsiduna fi al-ard) are counted as \\"the losers\\" in Al-Baqara, verse 27: > Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever that > which Allah ordered to be joined, and (who) make mischief in the earth: > Those are they who are the losers. ‚Äì The word \\"losers\\" indicates being bereft of something, and can also mean \\"being lost\\", in the sense of losing one's way or one's self. Hadiths Mischief has a broad meaning in Sahih Bukhari and other texts of Islam. Breaking ties with one's Muslim kith and kin is stated to be a form of fasad in Book 73 of Sahih Bukhari,Fethi Ahmed (2005), The Dilemma of Corruption in Southeast Asia, University Malaya Press, , pp 25-28 > The Prophet said, \\"Allah created the creations, and when He finished from > His creations, Ar-Rahm (womb) said, \\"(O Allah) at this place I seek refuge > with You from all those who sever the ties of kith and kin. Allah said, > 'Yes, won't you be pleased that I will keep good relations with the one who > will keep good relations with you, and I will sever the relation with the > one who will sever the relations with you.' Allah's Apostle added. \\"Read (in > the Qur'an) if you wish, the Statement of Allah: 'Would you then, if you > were given the authority, do mischief in the land and sever your ties of > kinship?' ‚Äì Sunan Abu Dawud confirms that the required punishment for fasad is execution or crucifixion. > When the Apostle of Allah cut off (the hands and feet of) those who had > stolen his camels and he had their eyes put out by fire (heated nails), > Allah reprimanded him on that (action), and Allah, the Exalted, revealed: > \\"The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Apostle and > strive with might and main for mischief through the land is execution or > crucifixion.\\" ‚Äì Sunan Abu Dawud, in 38.4359, states that the punishment for fasad was revealed for polytheists. In modern politics and law Pakistan Pakistan law includes the principle of fasad-fil-arz (corruption on earth), which allows an offender to be punished (with a sentence of up to 14 years of imprisonment) even if they are forgiven by the victim's party under Qisas and Diyat. Iran In the aftermath of the Islamic revolution in Iran, suspected royalists were purged from the civil service and the army with justifications that employed the Quranic notions of fasad and fitna. The clerical leadership attempted to present this campaign as analogous to the actions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and Ali ibn Abi Talib. Acting as the prayer leader of Tehran, Ayatollah Ali Montazeri commented that Muhammad was sent by God \\"to salvage [the inhabitants of Mecca] from corrupted moralities [mafasid akhlaq]\\". He identified fasad with \\"plotters, spies and traitors in government offices and institutions\\" and warned that failure to take action against it would put an end to \\"the sciences, the arts and progress\\".Haggay R. (1992), Crushing the opposition: adversaries of the Islamic Republic of Iran, The Middle East Journal, Vol. 46, No. 3, pp 427-428 In the Islamic Republic of Iran the offense is known as Mofsed-e-filarz and is a capital crime. The charge was used by Islamic Republican judicial authorities in the early days of the Iranian Revolution, resulting in many imprisonments and executions. Possibly more than 8,000 people suffered that fate, ranging from former members of the Shah's government, leaders of opposition or terrorist groups, or simply opponents of the regime.Detained Protesters Threatened with Execution, ICHRI, 4 January 2010 It has been used against leaders of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith on a number of occasions,Baha‚Äôi Leaders Remain Unjustly Detained After One Year, ICHRI, 14 May 2009 and in February 2011 a large majority of members of the Iranian parliament called for the prosecution and execution of Iranian opposition leaders Mehdi Karroubi and Mir-Hossein Mousavi on the charge of mofsed-e-filarz.Iran Lawmakers Want Opposition Leaders Killed, ALAN COWELL and NEIL MacFARQUHAR, nyt.com, February 15, 2011 See also *Mofsed- e-filarz *War crime *Corruption *Apostasy in Islam References Category:Arabic words and phrases in Sharia Category:Islamic terminology Category:Islam and capital punishment ","title":"Fasad"},{"id":"21599118","text":"Henry Alfred \\"Jackie\\" Gibson (31 March 1914 ‚Äì 15 January 1944) was a South African long-distance runner.

It is a cross-coupling reaction. This reaction was invented by and named after Jiri Srogl from the Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic, and Lanny S. Liebeskind from Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. There are three generations of this reaction, with the first generation shown below. The original transformation used catalytic Pd(0), TFP = tris(2-furyl)phosphine as an additional ligand and stoichiometric CuTC = copper(I) thiophene-2-carboxylate as a co-metal catalyst. The overall reaction scheme is shown below. The Liebeskind-Srogl coupling reaction Liebeskind-Srogl reaction is most commonly seen with thioether or thioester electrophiles and boronic acid or stannane nucleophiles but many other coupling partners are viable. In addition to alkyl and aryl thioesters; (hetereo)aryl thioethers, thioamides, thioalkynes, and thiocyanates are competent electrophiles. Virtually any metal-R bond capable of transmetalation has been demonstrated. Indium derived nucleophiles require no copper or base. Note that this scope is applicable for the first generation coupling as the second and third generations are mechanistically distinct and have only been demonstrated with thioesters capable of forming the six-membered metallocycle, boronic acids, and stannanes. 450x450px The first-generation approach to cross coupling is run under anaerobic conditions using stoichiometric copper and catalytic palladium. Second generation approach renders the reactions catalytic in copper by using an extra equivalent of boronic acid under aerobic, palladium free conditions. The additional equivalent liberates the copper from the sulfur auxiliary and allows it to turn over. This chemistry is limited to thioesters and thioethers and could also be limited by the cost and availability of the organoboron reagent. The third generation renders the reaction catalytic in copper while using only one equivalent of boronic acid.  Mechanism   Generation 1  The proposed reaction mechanism for the first generation is shown below. The thioester 1 complexes with copper complex 3 to form compound 4. With the oxidative insertion of [Pd] into the carbon‚Äìsulfur bond, compound 5 is formed, and with transmetallation, organopalladium species 8 is formed. The transmetallation proceeds via the transfer of R2 to the palladium metal center with concomitant transfer of the sulfur atom to the copper complex. Reductive elimination gives ketone 3 with the regeneration of the active catalyst 9. The Liebeskind‚ÄìSrogl coupling mechanism  Generation 2  The mechanism for the second generation is shown below. The mechanism does not follow a traditional oxidative addition-transmetelation-reductive elimination pathway like the first generation. In parallel to studies of Cu(I)-dioxygen reactions, a higher oxidation state, Cu-templated coupling is proposed. Coordination of copper(I) to the thioester undergoes oxidation by air to give a copper (II/III) intermediate. Metal templating by Cu(II/III) acts as a Lewis acid to both activate the thiol ester and deliver R2 (from either boron directly or via an intermediate Cu-R2 species), which produces the ketone and a Cu-thiolate. A second equivalent of boronic acid is needed to break the copper sulfur bond and liberate copper back into the catalytic cycle. 679x679px  Generation 3  The third generation renders the reaction catalytic in copper and uses only one equivalent of boronic acid by mimicking the metallothionein (MT) system that sponges metals from biological systems. The thio-auxilary features an N-O motif that mimics the S-S motif in the MT biosystem, that is necessary to break the copper sulfur bond and turn over the catalyst. This generation is palladium free and under microwave conditions. The mechanism is expected to follow that of the second generation (shown as an active Cu(I)-R2 species but R2 could be delivered directly from the coordinated boronic acid) but includes the auxiliary releasing copper back into the catalytic cycle instead of additional boronic acid. 550x550px  Applications in Synthesis  The Liebeskind‚ÄìSrogl coupling has been used as a key retrosynthetic disconnection in several natural product total synthesis. For example, in the synthesis of Goniodomin A, the Sasakki lab utilized this chemistry to rapidly access the northern half of the natural product. 650x650px The Guerrero lab used the Liebeskind‚ÄìSrogl coupling to construct the entire carbon skeleton of viridin in high yield on multi-gram scale. 650x650px The lab of Figadere used the Liebeskind‚ÄìSrogl coupling early in their synthesis of amphidinolide F by employing this reaction to construct the north eastern fragment of the macrocycle and the terpene chain. 550x550px  Other  Directed Difunctionalization The Yu lab has demonstrated that in the presence of two thioether bonds, one can be selectively functionalized in the presence of one equivalent of nucleophile if directed by a carbonyl oxygen. This reaction proceeds through a five-membered palladacycle with oxidative addition taking place on this cis-thioether. Additional equivalence of nucleophile will functionalize the trans-position. 550x550px  References  Category:Carbon-carbon bond forming reactions Category:Name reactions ","title":"Liebeskind‚ÄìSrogl coupling"},{"id":"21599135","text":"Nicolas La Grange (1707‚Äì1775) was a French playwright and translator, notable for his 1768 translation of Lucretius' De Rerum Natura and for several plays.

Biography Zierlein grew up in Lenora, Kansas. After spending two years in the Marines from 1966 to 1968, including a tour of duty in Vietnam in 1967, he attended Fort Hays State College. He played defensive end for Fort Hays State in 1969 before graduating in 1971. Coaching career Zierlein embarked on his coaching career as a graduate assistant and linebackers coach at his alma mater in 1970. After two years coaching at Fort Hays State, he spent the following six seasons (1972‚Äì1977) as a high school assistant in Texas. In 1978, he returned to the college game at the University of Houston where he served as offensive line coach for nine seasons. In 1987, he got his first professional experience as an assistant with the Washington Commandos of the Arena Football League. When the Commandos went on hiatus the next year, Zierlein took a job at Tulane where he worked the next three seasons before returning to the pro ranks with the New York/New Jersey Knights of the National Football League's development league, the World League of American Football. With the Knights he held the title of offensive coordinator under Mouse Davis as well as coaching the offensive line. When the Knights folded in 1992, Zierlein once more headed back to college, this time at LSU. Zierlein spent two years at LSU, coaching the offensive line under head coach Curley Hallman. In 1995, he returned to Tulane, this time for what would be a two-year stint under Tommy Bowden. In 1997, he moved on to the University of Cincinnati as the running game coordinator and offensive line coach under Rick Minter. In 2001, Zierlein gained his first NFL experience with the Cleveland Browns. He served for four seasons as the Browns' offensive line coach under the Butch Davis regime. Zierlein's current Pittsburgh Steelers colleague Bruce Arians served as the offensive coordinator for the first three of Zierlein's seasons at Cleveland. He returned from a one-year absence from football in 2006 as the assistant offensive line coach for the Buffalo Bills under Dick Jauron. When Mike Tomlin was hired as the Steelers new head coach in 2007, he brought Zierlein to Pittsburgh to coach the offensive line. Tomlin and Zierlein had previously worked together in 1999‚Äì2000 with the Cincinnati Bearcats. Steelers assistant special teams coach Amos Jones was also a member of that Bearcats coaching staff. Zierlein was relieved of his duties with the Steelers on January 6, 2010. E-mail gaffe Zierlein gained unwanted notoriety in 2007 when he mistakenly forwarded an e-mail to a large number of high-level NFL employees, including commissioner Roger Goodell. The e-mail, which Zierlein had received from Steelers pro personnel coordinator Doug Whaley, contained an inappropriate video. Zierlein apologized for the gaffe, but was not disciplined by the team or the league. Personal life Zierlein and his wife, Marcia, have three children and several grandchildren. Their son Lance is a sports talk radio host at Houston's \\"Sports talk 790\\" and a writer for NFL.com. Their son Mike (Lance's brother) is the assistant football coach at Cypress Ridge High School in Houston, Texas.

In this view, microbial-triggered mass extinctions are attempts to return the Earth to the microbial-dominated state it has been for most of its history.Gaia's evil twin: Is life its own worst enemy? New Scientist. Volume 202, Issue 2713, 17 June 2009, pages 28‚Äì31 (Cover story) The metaphor refers to the mythological Medea (representing the Earth), who kills her own children (multicellular life). Past \\"suicide attempts\\" include: *Methane poisoning, 3.5 billion years ago *The oxygen catastrophe, 2.45 billion years ago *Snowball Earth, twice, 2.4‚Äì2.1 billion years ago and 790‚Äì630 million years ago *At least five putative hydrogen sulfide-induced mass extinctions, such as the Great Dying, The list does not include the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, since this was, at least partially, externally induced by a meteor impact. Peter Ward also believes that the current man-made climate change and mass extinction event may be considered to be the most recent Medean event. As these events are anthropogenic, he postulates that Medean events are not necessarily caused by microbes, but by intelligent life as well. He believes that the final mass extinction of complex life, roughly about 500-900 million years in the future, will also be considered a Medean event. Plant life that will still exist by then will be forced to adapt to a warming and expanding Sun, causing them to remove even more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (which in turn will have already be due to the increasing heat from the Sun gradually speeding up the weathering process that removes them from the atmosphere), and ultimately accelerating the complete extinction of complex life by making carbon dioxide levels drop down to just 10 ppm, below which plants can no longer survive. However, Ward simultaneously argues that intelligent life such as humans may not necessarily just trigger future Medean events, but may eventually prevent them from occurring.

Hopkins. It was among the 15 documentaries shortlisted for the Best Documentary Oscar by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the 82nd Academy Awards. It is the first uncensored film about M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (MSF or Doctors Without Borders) and seeks to viscerally portray the real life of western doctors in the field as they confront the many difficulties and dilemmas of working in extreme conditions with limited resources. Although Living in Emergency is a cinema verit√© documentary film, it has been compared to fictional films like M*A*S*H (1970) and the TV series House.  Synopsis  Set in war-torn Congo and post-conflict Liberia, Living in Emergency interweaves the stories of four doctors as they struggle to provide emergency medical care in extreme conditions. Two of the doctors are new recruits: a 26-year-old Australian stranded in a remote bush clinic and an American surgeon struggling to cope under the load of emergency cases in a shattered capital city. Two others are experienced field hands: a dynamic Head of Mission, valiantly trying to keep morale high and tensions under control, and an exhausted veteran, who has seen too much horror and wants out. Amidst the chaos, each volunteer must confront the severe challenges of the work, the tough choices, and the limits of their idealism.  Production  It took six months for the filmmakers to persuade MSF to grant them unrestricted access to film the field operations. More than 25 production companies had tried and been rejected. Undeterred, director Mark N. Hopkins and his team produced a 15-minute pilot about the organization's emergency response to the 2005‚Äì06 Niger food crisis and were consequently given permission. For a period of two years the team filmed in various MSF hospitals. The shoots were organized to cover the various facets of the MSF organization: the administrative base, the conflict and post-conflict missions, and a response to natural disaster. The film was shot in Liberia after the Second Civil War and in the North-East of the Democratic Republic of Congo where there is still ongoing conflict after the Second Congo War. Two other countries that were filmed did not make it into the final film.  Release  Living in Emergency premiered at the 65th Venice Film Festival. It was released theatrically by Bev Pictures at the Lumiere Theater in San Francisco and other theaters in the U.S. on June 4, 2010. First Run Features released it on DVD and VOD.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 93% of 26 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 7.2/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"An unflinching, inspiring look at amazing bravery and commitment, Living in Emergency disappoints only in leaving the viewer wanting more.\\" Metacritic rated it 76/100 based on fifteen reviews. Ronnie Scheib of Variety wrote that the film captures the subjects \\"with rare candor and a refreshing lack of piety\\". Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter called it an \\"unforgettable chronicle\\" that \\"is a bracing blast of reality\\". A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote, \\"[T]he film, just like any good hospital television series, is really about the curious psychology of the medical profession.\\"  References   External links  * * * Category:2008 films Category:2008 documentary films Category:American films Category:American documentary films Category:American independent films Category:English-language films Category:Documentary films about health care Category:M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res Category:Films shot in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Films shot in Liberia ","title":"Living in Emergency"},{"id":"21599366","text":"The 128th Infantry Regiment (\\"Les Terribles\\") is a United States military unit of the Wisconsin National Guard. The 128th has served as part of the American Civil War, Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Mexican Civil War, World War I, World War II and the Iraq War. History The 1st Battalion, 128th Infantry, traces its history to the spring of 1861, when the 2nd Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment, comprising independent companies from throughout the state, was organized and activated into federal service. The 2nd Wisconsin was joined by several other regiments to form the famous \\"Iron Brigade,\\" which soon became one of the most feared and respected units on either side in the Civil War for its performance in such battles as Antietam and Gettysburg. Additionally, Eau Claire was home to the soldiers that comprised Company C of the 8th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment, otherwise known as the \\"Eagle Regiment,\\" because of its famous mascot \\"Old Abe,\\" a pet bald eagle who accompanied the regiment into battle. The 8th Wisconsin fought in the western theater at places such as Vicksburg, MS. In 1898, four infantry regiments from Wisconsin were formed and activated at the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. During that brief conflict, Wisconsin Guardsmen participated in the capture of Puerto Rico.http://dma.wi.gov/dma/news/2015news/15008.asp A letter from a member of the 2nd Wisconsin describes some of the details of the guardsmen's role in the conflict: > \\"We landed here at Ponce Friday without opposition by the Spaniards. They > fled to the hills when we came in sight. But it has been skirmish every day > since we landed. We have captured 200 prisoners. The 3rd Wisconsin [National > Guard] got into battle yesterday and one man was wounded in the hip, and one > of the Massachusetts boys got shot in the neck, and went a mile, and a half > before he fell. There was a skirmish last night but have heard of no one > being wounded, or killed.\\" 3 members of the Wisconsin Infantry Regiments died of fever: *Captain Dawson of Company F from Merrill died Anniston, Alabama October 29, 1898 of typhoid fever which was preceded by pneumonia..Wood County Reporter November 3, 1898 .p.3 *Alfred G.

Goodhouse of Mauston Company died October 31, 1898 of heart failure following yellow fever on Hospital Ship \\"Relief\\" night before the \\"Relief\\" docked at Philadelphia.Wood County Reporter November 3, 1898 .p.3 In 1916, Wisconsin infantry units served with General Pershing to chase Pancho Villa along the Texas border and into northern Mexico. The Wisconsin troops were again activated in 1917 as the United States declared war on Germany. After a period of intensive training, the Wisconsin Guardsmen were redesignated as the 128th Infantry, assigned to the 32nd Division and sent to France. In the closing months of the war, the 128th Infantry participated in several major campaigns including Alsace, Aisne-Marne, Oise-Aisne and Meuse- Argonne. For their fury in combat, the nickname \\"Les Terribles\\" or \\"The Terrible Ones\\" was given to them by the French. As they pierced the famed Hindenburg Line, the 32d Infantry Division became known as the \\"Red Arrow\\" Division ‚Äì a name that has remained to the present day and is reflected in shoulder patch. 21 years later, the 128th, as part of the 32d Division, was called to federal service on 15 October 1940. After training in Louisiana, the unit was moved by convoy to Port Adelaide, Australia. In 1942 the 128th, as part of the 32d, broke through the Japanese lines at the Battle of Buna (\\"Bloody Buna\\"), New Guinea; in 1944 defeated Japanese General Adachi's divisions at Saidor and Aitape, New Guinea; defeated the Japanese Imperial First Marines in Leyte (Imperial First Marines only loss in 200 years); and pierced the Yamashita Line in Luzon. The 128th Regiment and 32d Division were still in combat action when the cease fire order came on 15 August 1945. The 32d Infantry Division had been in combat 654 days ‚Äì more than any United States division in any war. When the cold war peaked with the Soviet blockade of Berlin in October 1961, President Kennedy became the third United States president in the 20th Century to call the 128th, as part of the 32d Infantry Division, to federal active service. The division trained at Ft. Lewis, WA, for 10 months, maintaining a high level of readiness until the crisis abated. In August 1962 its soldiers returned home and resumed their status as Wisconsin National Guardsmen. The 2nd Battalion, 128th Infantry, was formed as a result of the transitioning of the 32d Infantry Brigade from a mechanized unit to a separate light infantry brigade in September 2001.

The Yellow Jackets finished the season 11‚Äì3, 7‚Äì1 in ACC play, represented the coastal division in the ACC Championship Game where they defeated Atlantic Division champion Clemson 39‚Äì34 to earn the ACC's automatic bid to the BCS. The Yellow Jackets would be invited to the FedEx Orange Bowl where they lost 24‚Äì14 to Iowa. Later in 2011 the ACC Championship was vacated by the NCAA due to the circumstances surrounding an improper benefits investigation. Previous season The previous season ended with a 9‚Äì4 record under first-year head coach Paul Johnson, including a share of the ACC Coastal Crown and continuing 12-year bowl streak with an invite to the 2008 Chick-fil-A Bowl. The Jackets ended a 13-game losing streak against Florida State with a 31‚Äì28 win in Atlanta, and ended a seven-game losing streak to rival Georgia by 45‚Äì42 in Athens. Tech finished the season ranked 22 in the AP and the USA Today Coaches' Poll. Johnson was named ACC Coach of the Year by the Atlantic Coast Conference Media Association and 2008 National Coach of the Year by CBSSports.com. Preseason The 2009 squad returns ACC Player of the Year and All-American B-Back Jonathan Dwyer, Quarterback Josh Nesbitt, A-Back Roddy Jones, WR Demaryius Thomas, and the entire offensive line from the bowl game. Tech adds Louisville transfer Anthony Allen to the backfield. On defense, Tech returns eight of eleven starters including All-ACC players Morgan Burnett and Derrick Morgan. Tech returns nineteen starters to a squad that defeated three ranked teams in 2008. Johnson signed a recruiting class of 21 players.

On the first play of the season, the former ACC Player of the Year took a Josh Nesbitt pitch 74 yards down the sideline for a touchdown. Dwyer was untouched on the carry. The B-Back, Tech's feature back in the offense, carried the ball six more times in the game, finishing with seven carries. Josh Nesbitt connected on a touchdown with Anthony Allen. In Tech's home opener, Demaryius \\"BayBay\\" Thomas posted a 100-yard receiving performance, catching the ball four times for 101 yards. All-American candidate Morgan Burnett listed an interception, his first of 2009 and 11th of his career. Coach Johnson earned his 10th win at Georgia Tech. Clemson Pregame Line: Clemson +5.5 GT vs. Clemson Tigers Georgia Tech earned a second half scare by Clemson. However, Scott Blair connected on three field goals for the Yellow Jackets to seal the win. Tech scored on three plays in the first half. Louisville transfer Anthony Allen took a Josh Nesbitt pitch 82 yards down the sideline to score Tech's first touchdown on its opening possession. Jerrard Tarrant returned a punt 65 yards to increase the Tech lead to 14‚Äì0. Following a Scott Blair field goal, Tech on its ensuing possession marched the ball downfield only to have itself stopped. On 4th down, Tech ran onto the field with its kicking unit, but instead of kicking the field goal, Blair took the snap, finding \\"BayBay\\" Thomas down the sideline, earning a 40-yard touchdown score for the White and Gold. While Tech led 24‚Äì7 at the half, the Tech defense gave up 27 unanswered points. Clemson took the lead 27‚Äì24 in the 4th quarter.

Miami Pregame Line: Miami ‚Äì4.5 GT at Miami Hurricanes Georgia Tech traveled to Land Shark Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida to compete against the University of Miami. Offensive Coordinator Mark Whipple and Miami Quarterback Jacory Harris prepared a game plan against Dave Wommack and the Georgia Tech Defense. Miami threw the ball for 300 yards. Tech managed to run for only 180 yards, and it earned merely 250 yards of total offense. Josh Nesbitt and Demaryius Thomas hooked up for a touchdown late in the game. On just Tech's third possession of the game, a 40-yard Roddy Jones touchdown was nullified on a block in the back call by walk-on Kevin Cone. The crucial call nullified a 14‚Äì10 score midway through the second quarter. The Tech offense stalled out on the same drive, attempting a 40-yard field goal which was missed by PK Scott Blair.

He connected with Demaryius \\"BayBay\\" Thomas for a touchdown. Jonathan Dwyer finished with 157 yards on 17 carries. Josh Nesbitt ran for two touchdowns and Roddy Jones ran one in from 13. left Mississippi State Pregame line: Mississippi State +6 GT at Mississippi State Bulldogs Georgia Tech was 2‚Äì0 against Mississippi State University in the all-time series going into the October 3 contest between the two schools. On the first possession of the game, former Tulsa DE and current Georgia Tech End Anthony Egbuniwe sacked MSU QB Tyson Lee, stripping the ball from Lee's possession and gaining possession for Georgia Tech. Stephen Hill took a 30-yard reverse to the house on Tech's opening drive. Josh Nesbitt threw 266 yards on 11 of 14 completions and a touchdown. Nesbitt led the Tech offense all the way to MSU's goal line on its second possession with his throwing. Jonathan Dwyer ran the ball in from two yards to improve the Tech lead to 14‚Äì0. MSU responded with a 98-yard kickoff return for a touchdown. Tech was slated to go up 21‚Äì7 when Jonathan Dwyer fumbled the ball around Tech's goal line and MSU recovered, earning a touchback and possession of the football. On the ensuing drive, Lee and Anthony Dixon fumbled; DB Jerrard Tarrant picked it up, returning it 35 yards to the house. Tech won the contest by a score of 42‚Äì31.

Florida State Pregame Line: Florida State -3.5 GT at Florida State Seminoles Georgia Tech ran for 401 yards en route to defeating Florida State 49‚Äì44 at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee, Florida. Tech had never defeated the Seminoles in Tallahassee previously. Jonathan Dwyer ran for a couple scores, one of which was a 69-yard memorable dart downfield on the first play of Tech's third possession. A-Backs Anthony Allen, Marcus Wright, and Embry Peeples posted stellar games. Allen took a pitch 60 yards down the sideline on Tech's second drive to set up a Josh Nesbitt one yard touchdown. Tech had four possessions in the first half, scoring on each of them. It finished with 49 points. Nesbitt added two more touchdowns, the final coming late in 4th quarter. On the game-winning drive, Roddy Jones dropped a Josh Nesbitt pitch, and FSU picked it up, maintaining possession. However, Nesbitt used both of his hands to take the football back before the FSU player was down, regaining possession for Tech. Nesbitt later scored on a 25-yard scamper that same drive, sealing victory for the White and Gold. The epic scamper increased the Tech lead to 11 at 49‚Äì38. While the Tech Offense posted a career day, the Tech defense struggled. It gave up 550 yards of total offense, 408 coming in the first half. Christian Ponder had a career day, throwing for five touchdowns. FSU punted once all game, Tech never punted. Paul Johnson and his spread option offense posted its third 400 plus yard rushing performance at Georgia Tech. The other two came in Johnson's first season at Tech, against Miami (FL) in Atlanta and Georgia in Athens. \\"We simply could not stop them.\\" \\\\- Bobby Bowden Virginia Tech Pregame Line: Virginia Tech ‚Äì3.5 GT vs. Virginia Tech Hokies Josh Nesbitt scored three touchdowns and Georgia Tech ran for 306 yards to upset #4 Virginia Tech on a cold, memorable night in Atlanta. For the second straight week, head coach Paul Johnson led the #19 Yellow Jacket squad to a victory, earning a win that ended a 17-game losing skid to top five opponents played at Bobby Dodd Stadium since 1962. Jason Peters batted down and intercepted Tyrod Taylor in the 1st quarter. Josh Nesbitt ran in a couple scores from inside the five, and Sophomore Marcus Wright scored from 13 yards out in the third quarter to increase the Tech lead to 11. The Georgia Tech Defense played effectively, limiting an elusive Tyrod Taylor and the Virginia Tech offense to only 342 yards of total offense. Taylor scored on a 3rd quarter scamper. However, on 3rd and 7 with 3:02 remaining in the final quarter, Josh Nesbitt had a 33-yard game icing stiff arm and score to increase the Tech lead to 28‚Äì16. Following the announcement of a 28‚Äì23 final tally, Grant Field was swarmed. Steven Sylvester and Derrick Morgan each recorded a sack. Jonathan Dwyer and Anthony Allen combined for 150 yards on the ground to set up Josh Nesbitt and the Georgia Tech offense. The win over Frank Beamer's #4 Hokies improved Paul Johnson's record to 10‚Äì1 at home. \\"...with the caliber of players they have ‚Äì Nesbitt is unbelievable, they've got Dwyer ‚Äì it's just exhausting.\\" \\\\- Torrian Gray Virginia Pregame Line: Virginia +6 GT at Virginia Cavaliers Georgia Tech defeated Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia for the first time since 1990 by a score of 34‚Äì9.

Josh Nesbitt ran in two touchdowns from inside the five. Redshirt Freshman Malcolm Munroe forced a fumble by Virginia punt returner Chase Minnifield. The Tech offense accumulated 447 yards of total offense. The Tech Defense held Virginia to 198 yards. ...Tech's time of possession today was the highest in at least 20 years; the next closest in the last 20 years was 42:10 vs. Wake Forest on September 14, 1996 and 42:06 vs. North Carolina earlier this season ...

Tech leads the series with the Commodores 18‚Äì15‚Äì3 in 36 contests. Tech comes in averaging nearly 295 yards on the ground. Tech holds a #11 ranking in the AP, Coaches', and BCS polls, its highest mark since 1998. A win over Bobby Johnson and the Commodores could mean Tech's highest ranking since 2001. Jonathan Dwyer rushed for a career- high 186 yards and three touchdowns while Josh Nesbitt added 2 touchdowns on the ground and 2 in the air as Georgia Tech routed Vanderbilt 56‚Äì31 in Nashville, Tenn. Vanderbilt led 31‚Äì28 with twelve minutes left in the 3rd quarter, but a series of turnovers allowed Georgia Tech's high powered offense to score four more touchdowns. Josh Nesbitt threw an 87-yard touchdown to sophomore Embry Peeples in the 4th quarter to increase the Tech lead to 18 at 49‚Äì31. The win marked Tech's fourth victory on the road, its most since 2000. It also elevated the Jackets to a #10 BCS ranking, its highest ranking in November since 1990. Paul Johnson posted his fifth 400 plus yard rushing attack at Georgia Tech, as the Yellow Jackets ran up and down Nashville, Tenn. for 404 yards. \\"There is no way to figure it out.\\" ‚Äì Bobby Johnson Wake Forest Pregame Line: Wake Forest +16 GT vs. Wake Forest Demon Deacons The Yellow Jackets, ranked in the Top 10 for the first time since 1999, hosted the Demon Deacons in Atlanta. The game got off to a quick start as Tech jumped out to a quick 10‚Äì0 lead helped by Preston Lyons first career TD. But the Deacons controlled the rest of the first half scoring 17 unanswered points. The Yellow Jackets kept committing penalties, contributing to all of Wake Forest's points. The offense also had its share of mistakes, getting called three times for chop blocks as the officials seemed to pay close attention to the interior line after opponents complained of dirty blocking tactics. After trailing 17‚Äì10 at the half, Tech's Jonathan Dwyer broke off a 59-yard TD run on Georgia Tech's first offensive snap of the second half, tying the game at 17. Wake Forest managed only one first down on its four possessions after halftime, and Georgia Tech went ahead 24‚Äì17 when Josh Nesbitt scored on a 12-yard run with 8:19 left in regulation. Wake Forest QB Riley Skinner drove the Deacons down late in the 4th quarter and threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Devon Brown with 4:27 remaining. After Georgia Tech was stopped again on fourth down, Wake Forest appeared to be driving into range for a winning field-goal attempt. But Skinner was sacked by Derrick Morgan on third-and-7 from the Georgia Tech 35, and Wake Forest decided to punt it away and settle for OT. In the first period of OT, the Yellow Jacket defense was able to hold Wake Forest to a field goal helped by a Derrick Morgan sack on Riley Skinner on a 3rd and seven. On the Jacket's OT possession, Georgia Tech drove to the 5 where it faced fourth-and- less-than-a-yard. The Yellow Jackets initially tried to draw Wake offsides, but was forced to burn a timeout when that didn't work. Deciding to go for the first instead of kicking a field goal, Josh Nesbitt got the first down on a QB sneak. On the very next play, the Jackets were able to get into the endzone thanks to another Josh Nesbitt sneak and was able to seal the victory. The victory lifted Tech to a 9‚Äì1 record and dropped the Deacons to 4‚Äì6. The Yellow Jacket offense, also known as the Nesbone, rumbled up and down Grant Field for 412 yards, Coach Johnson's sixth 400 plus rushing yard performance in two seasons. Duke Pregame Line: Duke +13 GT at Duke Blue Devils Georgia Tech surged to the top of the ACC Coastal division behind the performance of All American Tailback Jonathan Dwyer, who carried the ball 14 times for 110 yards and two touchdowns. Josh Nesbitt connected with true Freshman Stephen Hill and veteran Junior Demaryius \\"BayBay\\" Thomas for a couple of scores en route to a 49‚Äì10 romp of Duke University at Wallace Wade Stadium in Durham, North Carolina The Yellow Jacket defense allowed 10 points early before shutting out the Blue Devil Offense the remainder of the game. Junior Defensive Tackle Ben Anderson received ACC Defensive Lineman of the Week honors after his dominating performance in the trenches recording 2 sacks, 3 tackles for loss and 5 tackles. The Yellow Jacket offense was the story of the game after falling behind 10‚Äì0 in the first quarter. The high powered triple option offense scored forty nine consecutive points to wrap up the Coastal Division for Paul Johnson and the Yellow Jackets. Georgia Pregame Line: Georgia +9 GT vs. Georgia Bulldogs Georgia Tech was outgained by the Bulldogs both rushing (349‚Äì209) and time of possession, which had been key components to the Yellow Jackets' success throughout the season. Georgia tailbacks Washaun Ealey and Caleb King both had breakout performances, running for 183 and 166 yards, respectively, both career highs. Georgia Tech had a chance to take the lead late in the game, but Demaryius Thomas dropped a pass on fourth down which would have resulted in a first down, securing Georgia's 30‚Äì24 victory. This game dropped Georgia Tech's record against Georgia coach Mark Richt to 1‚Äì8.

In its heyday from 1911 to 1922, it was the scene of speeches by U.S. Presidents William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson and Gen. John J. Pershing. It is also the room where Paul Whiteman, later known as the \\"Jazz King\\", got his start as a bandleader in 1919, where Rudolph Valentino danced with movie starlets, and where Hollywood held its most significant balls during the early days of the motion picture business. Known for its history and its stained-glass Tiffany skylight, noted Los Angeles columnist Jack Smith called it \\"surely the most beautiful room in Los Angeles\\". The Palm Court was designated as a City of Los Angeles Historic- Cultural Monument (HCM#80) in 1971. Palm Court's heyday 1911-1922 Built in 1906, the eight-story Hotel Alexandria was designed by noted Los Angeles architect John Parkinson. In 1911, the firm of Parkinson and Bergstrom was hired to design an addition that would double the capacity. The Palm Court was part of the 1911 addition. When the design of the new \\"crystal palmroom\\" was announced, the Los Angeles Times wrote: Palm Court as it appeared in 1920 during a banquet in honor of Gen. John J. Pershing. > \\"The room will be one of the largest of its kind in California and will be > available for social affairs of every nature. Its primary object, however, > will be more of a furnishing a convenient place for afternoon teas, card > parties and evening receptions.\\" When the new ballroom opened in October 1911, it was acknowledged for its beauty. The room was \\"christened\\" in a gala attended by 385 of the city's \\"most prominent names.\\" The Alexandria orchestra played throughout the evening,\\" and the Los Angeles Times reported the next day on the city's spectacular new room: > \\"The great room, over one hundred feet in length and seventy-five feet in > width, was a sunburst of light. Great crystal chandeliers blazed from a > dozen vantage points, while softer and smaller lights were placed along the > four sides of the room. ... The perfection and symphony of the great room > held the guests spellbound upon their arrival. As the stately ladies and > gentlemen entered the salon the pause each made at the threshold as with > intense interest they swept the salon with their gaze was noticeable.\\" Rudolph Valentino danced with young starlets in the Palm Court. For the next 12 years (until the opening of the Biltmore in 1923), the Palm Court was the city's most prestigious ballroom event location, hosting receptions for the likes of President Woodrow Wilson and Gen. John J. Pershing, as well as balls where Hollywood's silent film stars and early movie moguls mingled. By 1912, the Alexandria had become such an important gathering place that the Los Angeles Times wrote the following: > \\"What Union Square was to old New York, what Forty-second street is to the > present metropolis, and what the vicinity of the Cort Theater is to San > Francisco, the Alexandria mezzanine seems to be to theatrical Los Angeles. > ... Hardly ever does the day pass in which some nationally-known actor or > actress does not linger in the low settees or pause at the golden rail, > looking down into the lobby below -- pausing, lingering, while in whispered > tones behind rises the chatter that his or her presence has caused.\\" Rudolph Valentino, whose untimely death at age 31 caused mass hysteria among his female fans, was a regular visitor to the dances held at the Alexandria's great ballroom. Actress Claire Windsor recalled that, when she and Valentino were \\"$5-a-day extras\\", they rode the streetcar from Westlake Park to dance in the Palm Court. Silent movie actress Mary MacLaren later recalled that her mother had \\"blighted a blossoming romance\\" with Valentino when she would not allow her to go dancing with \\"Rudy\\" at the Alexandria. A third actress, Marjorie Bennett, also recalled meeting Valentino at a tea dance at the Alexandria, when Valentino was \\"a handsome aspiring Italian actor, Rodolpho d'Antonguolla.\\" In the Alexandria's heyday, movie stars and other celebrities, including Valentino, Mary Miles Minter, Sarah Bernhardt, Enrico Caruso and Jack Dempsey were guests. Charlie Chaplin reportedly kept a suite at the Alexandria and did improvisations in the lobby, and western star Tom Mix reportedly rode his horse through the lobby. The large oriental rug in the lobby was called the \\"million-dollar carpet\\", because there was purportedly a $1 million worth of business done there every day. It was there that D.W. Griffith, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks met in 1919 to form United Artists. U.S. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson, and many foreign dignitaries, also stayed at the hotel while visiting Los Angeles. Notable events from the Palm Court's heyday At one of the first events in the new ballroom, Pres. William Howard Taft delivered a speech advocating the creation of a court of nations to decide disputes between countries. Dancer Anna Pavlova performed her celebrated \\"Glow Worm Dance\\" in 1915. In a 1918 speech at the Alexandria, Japanese Vice Admiral Kantar≈ç Suzuki pledged friendship with the U.S. and said, \\"No yellow peril ever had its origin in Japan.\\" Suzuki was Japan's Prime Minister when it surrendered at the end of World War II. Bebe Daniels vamped at Hollywood's Thanksgiving ball \\"clothed in that siren shade of Viennese red.\\" The \\"Jazz King\\", Paul Whiteman led his first band at the Alexandria, providing dinner and dance music for Hollywood's elite. Gen. John J. Pershing condemned internationalists and anarchists at a dinner in his honor in 1920. Actress Colleen Moore served as a fashion model at the 1920 \\"Christmas in Paris\\" ball. From 1911 to 1923, the Alexandria ballroom (now known as the Palm Court) was the site of many of the city's most important gatherings. The following list identifies some of the notable events associated with the room. 1911 * October 1911 ‚Äì U.S. President William Howard Taft delivered a speech on international peace at a banquet at the Alexandria Hotel. Taft noted that it is always \\"the wrong men\\" who are killed in war. He said that the rulers, legislators, diplomats and bureau chiefs sleep in safety while the soldiers who usually \\"have not the least idea of what the war is about shoot at each other on the battlefield.\\" Taft advocated the creation of a court of nations to decide disputes between countries and suggested that \\"there should be no armies or navies except the army and navy of the allied powers which would enforce the decree of the court.\\" The Los Angeles Times called the speech \\"masterful and statesmanlike in every sense of the word.\\" 1912 * February 1912 ‚Äì The city's leaders gathered at the Alexandria for an elaborate banquet in honor of the 75th birthday of Gen. Harrison Gray Otis, editor in chief and general manager of the Los Angeles Times. * December 1912 - The city's first subscription ball since 1910 was held at the Alexandria, and the Los Angeles Times reported: \\"The social season of 1912-13 had its opening and it apotheosis last night in the ballroom of the Alexandria.\\" 1913 * February 1913 - At a Mardi Gras costume ball, the Alexandria ballroom was decorated with \\"clownish faces of elfs of mischief\\" grinning down from every angle, and a girt with hundreds of small yellow bulbs, \\"each light covered with a grotesque masque\\", all presenting \\"a scene of ghostly enchantment\\" and casting \\"a halo of unreality.\\" The Times described the following scene on the dance floor: \\"Serpentines glided in and out among the throng; someone started the Tango dance, a weird conception of rhythm and action which came all the way from Argentina and which offers something entirely new.\\" 1915 * May 1915 ‚Äì A.C. Bilicke, the Los Angeles millionaire who built the Alexandria and was president of the Alexandria Hotel Company, died while a passenger on the Cunard liner Lusitania, which was sunk by a German torpedo off the coast of Ireland. * June 1915 - The Photoplayers Ball at the Alexandria ballroom was described by the Los Angeles Times as the \\"most brilliant entertainment which the photoplayers of Los Angeles have ever given.\\" The dance was held in the ballroom and on the mezzanine with punch being served in the adjoining anterooms. Dinner was served at midnight in the grill. The event was enlivened by \\"brilliant little impromptu contributions in the way of witty speeches, songs and recitations\\" by actors, including Raymond Hitchcock, Tom Meighan and Carlyle Blackwell. Jesse Lasky made a speech on the future of motion pictures, and the other guests included Mary Pickford, Dorothy Gish, Francis X. Bushman, George Damerel, Billie West, Charles Clary, Herbert Rawlinson, Samuel Goldfish (later known as Samuel Goldwyn), Emma Carus, Myrtle Vail, Edmund Lowe, Mary Alden, Charles Winninger, Blanche Ring, Walter Catlett, Kathlyn Williams, Anita King, Fay Tincher, Bessie Barriscale, Augusta Anderson, Charlotte Walker, Marjorie Rambeau, Camille Astor, Anna Little, Cleo Madison, Blanche Ring, Florence Dagmar and Louis Bennison. * September 1915 ‚Äì In \\"one of the pleasantest social events of the motion-picture world\\", a dinner was given honoring dancer Anna Pavlova. Mack Sennett gave a speech at the dinner. Following the dinner, Mlle. Pavlova \\"graciously consented to do her celebrated 'Glow Worm Dance.'\\" * December 1915 ‚Äì A convention of the Produce Exchange was entertained by barefoot and Oriental dancers and whirling dervishes, and a complete cabaret show hosted by Irish comedian Harry Coleman. The Los Angeles Times reported, \\"Joy reigned supreme\\" at the banquet, as more than 250 guests gathered in the ballroom and \\"the fun was uninterrupted until the small hours of the morning.\\" 1916 * February 1916 - Plans were announced to construct the Pacific Coast's first indoor ice skating rink in the Alexandria ballroom. Plans called for refrigeration coils to be placed at the bottom of an oval tank. * March 1916 ‚Äì At a spirited luncheon at the Alexandria attended by more than 100 prominent businessmen, the California Prosperity League launched its campaign against prohibition in California. The group advocated a vigorous campaign against the forces advocating the destruction of one of California's most valuable industries ‚Äì the vineyards and wine manufacturers. Charles F. Lummis spoke and suggested that the Prosperity League also be known as the Sanity and Freedom League. * December 1916 ‚Äì The Cherry Blossom Players from Japan opened a month-long engagement at the Alexandria offering a production that included \\"Samurai, symbolic and humorous interpretive dances, folk songs with koto, samisen and shaquahachi music and several one-act plays mimed in the Japanese classic manner.\\" 1918 * March 1918 - After the Alexandria's chef, C.B. Nagel, made unspecified comments at a Red Cross Society midnight frolic that were perceived by some to reflect disloyalty, a Department of Justice special agent lodged a complaint with the hotel's manager. Nagel, one of the most noted chefs on the Pacific Coast, was forced to resign. The hotel's manager said, \\"Mr. Nagel is a good man in his line, but it is impossible for the hotel to keep in its employ anyone whose loyalty is challenged. Mr. Nagel is a German and the war situation had become decidedly tense.\\" * April 1918 ‚Äì The lower floors of the hotel, mezzanine, lobby and ballroom were turned over for celebration of Women's Liberty Loan Day. Several thousand \\"patriotic women of Los Angeles\\" participated in the rally. Actress Marie Dressler gave a speech in the ballroom boosting Liberty Bonds. * April 1918 - Japanese Vice- Admiral Kantar≈ç Suzuki was honored at a banquet. Suzuki pledged the friendship and goodwill of the Japanese people to the United States and noted, \\"No yellow peril ever had its origin in Japan.\\" Suzuki was opposed to Japan's war with the United States, before and throughout World War II. He was the Japanese Prime Minister at the time of its surrender at the end of World War II. * July 1918 - A Submarine Base gala to benefit sailors was held at the Alexandria featuring entertainment by Charlie Chaplin, Lillian Gish, Fannie Ward, Bert Guterman, Juanita Hansen, Fritzi Brunette, and Mary Miles Minter. * August 1918 - The Stage Women's War Relief held an auction of kisses at the Alexandria ballroom to benefit soldiers and sailors and their families. The Los Angeles Times reported that \\"100 beautiful young picture actresses have consented to auction off their kisses at the benefit.\\" Billie Mason and Wallace Reid were the auctioneers and referees at the event that also included dancing, music and vaudeville entertainment. The program included Belle Bennett, Wilbur Higby, and Jane Novak. Soldiers and sailors received their kisses free of charge. * December 1918 - Initiating a nine-day fundraising drive, Douglas Fairbanks was the star speaker at pep rally for Liberty Bond salesmen at the Alexandria ballroom. Fairbanks rode an elephant to the rally as part of a \\"patriotic parade\\" through downtown Los Angeles. 1919 * September 1919 ‚Äì U.S. President Woodrow Wilson spoke to a crowd of 515 diners at the Alexandria. Wilson entered the ballroom through an arch of grape vines, and \\"tiny electric bulbs gave the effect of glowworms in a garden.\\" The dining room was a mass of flowers with the walls banked with great yellow chrysanthemums relieved by masses of trailing ferns. The President's table, at the eastern end of the room, had a fountain centerpiece surrounded by banks of California fruits, and 50 varieties of roses strewn the length of the table. When Wilson spoke in favor of the League of Nations, there was a hush as the President paused, and then applause came. The Los Angeles Times reported that the dinner presented a brilliant picture of the city's social and business leaders with the women dressed in beautiful gowns for the opening of the fall social season. * November 1919 - The Alexandria hosted Hollywood's Thanksgiving ball, called \\"the great impeccable occasion of the year in Filmand.\\" With Prohibition set to commence in January 1920, the punchbowls were one of the biggest attractions. The Los Angeles Times reported: > \\"It got rumored around late in the evening that nearly a whole cup of > claret, first and last, had been poured into one of the punch-bowls and > there was quite a rush. ... Somebody also started the story that there was a > mysterious room somewhere, and that all of a half pint of beer and nearly a > whole bottle of perfume had been consumed, but the scandal was not verified, > and I for one don't believe it, because if anything like that were on tap, > Director Walter Edwards would have been on it, and he would have danced, > whereas he never shook a hoof all evening.\\" Bebe Daniels was \\"clothed in that siren shade of Viennese red and vamped whenever mommer Phyllis Daniels wasn't looking.\\" Mary Miles Minter arrived at midnight in a tall blue limousine. Charlie Chaplin came and \\"peeped rather gloomily in, but he saw so many vulgar, curious newspaper people about that he hastily withdrew.\\" * December 1919 - Paul Whiteman, who would become known as the Jazz King, got his start as a bandleader, opening at the Alexandria and playing as the house band for the next six months. Whiteman performed dance and dinner music for \\"the elite of moviedom\\" before moving to the East Coast. Whiteman later recalled that he first seriously attracted attention of dancers while playing with his nine-man orchestra at the Alexandria. Bandleader Ray A. West, with whose band Bing Crosby was discovered, followed Whiteman as the bandleader at the Alexandria. 1920 * January 1920 ‚Äì A crowd of 500 welcomed Gen John J. Pershing, leader of the American Expeditionary Force in World War I. Speeches were given \\"of 100 per cent Americanism\\" and condemning the menaces of internationalists, isolationists, anarchists, and profiteers. Pershing noted that ignorance had caused the fall of Russia and advocated requiring every foreigner to learn to read and write or be shipped back to \\"the foul nest from which they came.\\" Pershing's trip also included a parade down Broadway that included African-American troops from the Rainbow Division. * April 1920 - The Alexandria lobby was the scene of a post-dinner \\"knockdown and drag out fight\\" between Charlie Chaplin and Louis Mayer. Chaplin had recently separated from his wife, and when asked what caused the fight said, \\"Ask Mayer -- and ask my wife; they can tell you.\\" * May 1920 ‚Äì At a Chamber of Commerce dinner, speakers predicted that Los Angeles would soon surpass Chicago as American's second largest city and become the gateway to the Orient and \\"the center of the world.\\" * December 1920 - The entrance to the Alexandria ballroom was decorated as a reproduction of the Dead Rat Cafe in Paris for a \\"Christmas in Paris\\" ball. The event included a fashion show with movie actresses, including Marjorie Daw, Colleen Moore, Clara Horton, Karla Schramm, and Sylvia Brooke, serving as models. 1921 * July 1921 ‚Äì Film producer J.H. Goldberg invited Mayor Cryer, the City Council, journalists and 250 movie exhibitors to a preview of his new 30-reel feature, The Miracles of the Jungle. To secure the proper atmosphere for the film, dealing with \\"animals and the trials of a few white people in the heart of Africa,\\" the ballroom was converted into a jungle scene with palms, tules, vines with cutouts of animals hidden in the foliage, and lithographs suspended from the ceiling depicting scenes from the story. * August 1921 ‚Äì While on an American tour, Italian Fascist General (and future Prime Minister) Pietro Badoglio was honored as a \\"World War Hero\\" at a banquet hosted by the Chamber of Commerce. 1922 * March 1922 - The Alexandria ballroom was converted into \\"Bugland\\" for the annual \\"Artists' Ball.\\" The walls were covered with vivid purple, green, gold and black tapestries \\"depicting beetles, dragons, water dogs, and bugs, bugs, bugs of all climes, some of them so fantastic that they must have been imported from Mars.\\" The wall lights were camouflaged with giant bugs, and the lack of visible lights \\"added mystery to the fairyland scene.\\" Decline and use for boxing events The hotel declined after the Biltmore opened in 1923 and replaced the Alexandria as the city's most prestigious hotel. The opening of the luxurious Biltmore put an immediate dent in the Alexandria's business. In October 1923, the Los Angeles Times wrote: > \\"The exodus of the Associated Cofraternity of Lobby Loungers of Los Angeles > was completed yesterday from the Hotel Alexandria to the new Hotel Biltmore. > Its members, like members of similar organizations in all large cities, must > have the very newest in hotels ...\\" By 1932, the Alexandria Hotel Realty Company was bankrupt, leaving $1,159,000 in outstanding bonds. In February 1934, the Alexandria closed its doors, and many of its finest furnishings and fixtures were stripped and sold, including the famed million-dollar rug, marble columns, chandeliers, and gold leaf covering of the mezzanine lobby. The hotel reopened in 1937 but declined again in the 1950s and became a transient hotel. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Grand Ballroom (as the Palm Court was then known) was used as a training ring for boxers. In 1958, Pajarito Moreno drew crowds of 800 people to his training camp at the Palm Room prior to his featherweight title match with Kid Bassey. Sports columnist Braven Dyer noted, that on learning that Moreno was training in a ballroom, his barber sarcastically commented, > \\"A ballroom, yet! What's this frijole expect? That he's gonna have hisself a > ball with this here Hogan Bassey? Or maybe he's training for a waltz? Why > didn't he go get Fred Astaire for a sparrin' pardner?\\" In 1960, a Los Angeles Times article described the scene at the Palm Room where a dollar bought admission to watch world bantamweight boxing champion Jose Becerra and welterweight Battling Torres training for fights to be held at the Coliseum: > \\"You enter the Alexandria Hotel and find the lobby liberally sprinkled with > knots of people, most of them Latin. They lounge lazily and converse in low > tones. But when the door marked 'Palm Room' is thrown open, the scene > suddenly becomes animated. Everybody surges toward that door, including > women with babies in their arms or toddlers at their sides. ... The > admission charge is $1, and bills rain down on the man at the little desk, > though some don't appear to be that affluent.\\" Noting that Woodrow Wilson had once given a speech in the same room, the writer observed: \\"The (boxing) session ends to long applause -- probably more than President Wilson received. After all, he packed no punch.\\" Restoration and historic recognition Following a restoration in the 1980s, noted Los Angeles Times columnist Jack Smith noted, \\"It is a room of excellent proportions, and softly lighted by its lovely oval skylight, it is surely the most beautiful room in Los Angeles.\\" In 2005, the Los Angeles Times called the Palm Court an architectural gem: > \\"Then there are the Alexandria's architectural gems -- the magnificent Palm > Court ballroom with its stained-glass Tiffany skylight, for example -- that > made it the most luxurious hotel of its era. It was the film industry's > first home in the early 1900s, a place where dozens of studios maintained > offices, where Charlie Chaplin and friends formed United Artists, where the > lobby bustled with so many deal makers that a Persian rug there was deemed > the 'million-dollar carpet.'\\" The Palm Court was designated a Historic Cultural Monument (HCM #80) in 1971. As of 2008, the Alexandria had been converted to apartments. Blankenship Ballet at Alexandria in Palm Court In 2009, the Blankenship Ballet Company established its artistic residence at the Alexandria Hotel with the goal of revitalizing the Palm Court. In May 2010 the Blankenship Ballet Company created and produced the ballet-in-the-round \\"Cuban Ballet & Dance Extravaganza\\" featuring many ballet dancers formerly from the Ballet Nacional de Cuba. The Blankenship Ballet Company's May 2010 \\"Cuban Ballet & Dance Extravaganza\\" in Palm Court was documented by Supreme Master Television and played in multiple languages and dialects all over the world.

He has been described as \\"the most distinguished marine artist of his day.\\" His work is in the Tate, the Royal Academy, the Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum, the National Museum of the Royal Navy, and many other institutions around the world. Life and career Birth Wyllie was born on 5 July 1851 at 67 Albany Street, Camden, London,The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 23 September 2004, Editors Professor Colin Matthew, Professor Brian Harrison the elder son of William Morrison Wyllie (1820-1895), a prosperous minor-genre painter living in London and Wimereux, France, by his wife Katherine Benham (1813-1872), a singer. Before marrying W M Wyllie she had had three children by Percy Clinton Sydney Smythe, 6th Viscount Strangford. One of these, Wyllie's half-brother Lionel Percy Smythe, also made a name for himself as an artist. Early life and education Most of Wyllie's early summers were spent in France with his parents. He began to draw from an early age, and his natural talent was encouraged by his father and by Lionel Smythe, his step brother. He was given a thorough artistic education; first at the Heatherley School of Fine Art, and then in 1866, aged 15, at the Royal Academy Schools. At the Royal Academy he studied under Edwin Henry Landseer, John Everett Millais and Frederic Leighton, among others. He further demonstrated his precocious talent when he won the Turner Gold Medal in 1869 at the age of eighteen with Dawn after a Storm. His other early love affair, which he shared with his younger brother and fellow artist Charles William Wyllie, was sailing. Artistic career From the early 1870s Wyllie worked as an illustrator of maritime subjects for The Graphic. In 1875, the Academy rejected two of his works, and in anger he declared his intention to give up art for a career at sea. Over the course of several sailing cruises as far afield as Europe he laid the foundations for a lifelong love of the sea and of maritime subjects. Wyllie was a prolific exhibitor, with paintings and etchings shown at the Royal Academy, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters, the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers, the Grosvenor Gallery, the New English Art Club, the Society of British Artists, the Dowdeswell Galleries and the Fine Art Society. Wyllie became a member of the Society of British Artists in 1875, and of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1882. In 1887 he became a member of the New English Art Club. In 1889 he was made an associate of the Royal Academy, and in 1907 he was elected as a full member. In 1903 he became a member of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers. In 1920 he painted a mural for the Royal Exchange, London Blocking of Zeebrugge Waterway, St George‚Äôs Day, 23rd April 1918. Wyllie campaigned vigorously for the restoration of HMS Victory as a founder member of the Society for Nautical Research, and in 1930 his panorama of the Battle of Trafalgar was unveiled by King George V. The painting is seen by about 100,000 people every year where it still hangs in the Royal Naval Museum within the Historic Dockyard at Portsmouth. Wyllie was the most distinguished marine artist of his day and his work is still in great demand. From 1906, when he moved to Portsmouth, he became closely associated with the Royal Navy. So much so, indeed, that he was buried with full naval honours in 1931. In a moving ceremony, reminiscent of Nelson‚Äôs state funeral in 1806, his body was rowed up Portsmouth Harbour in a naval cutter past battleships with dipped colours and bugles calling and quaysides lined with dockyard workers. Marriage In 1876, at the age of 25, he became engaged to the 16-year-old Marion Amy Carew (31 December 1860-26 July 1937). They were married in 1879, and between 1880 and 1904 she bore him nine children; Harold (1880-1973), Bill (1882-1916), Dick (b 1883), EvaOn her grave, which she shares with W L Wyllie, she is described as their \\"Invalid daughter\\" (1884-1912), Robert (1888-1914), Douglas (b&d; 1894), an unnamed son (b&d; 1898), Eric (b 1900) and Aileen (1903-1987). Bill and Robert were killed in the First World War and Eva also died before her father. Death The grave of W L Wyllie, and his wife Marion. Also interred in the same plot are his daughters Eva and Aileen Remaining active in his final years, Wyllie continued to sail and paint. His work on the Trafalgar panorama was physically difficult, with much of the painting being done from step ladders, and on most days the work lasted from 10:00 until 17:00 with a short sleep at lunchtime. His daughter Aileen later remarked \\"At the time it seemed natural, but now that I am old, I cannot think how he did those hours on ladders in his 79th year.\\" Wyllie died on 6 April 1931 at 102 Fellows Road, Primrose Hill, London, and is buried at St Mary's church, within the grounds of Portchester Castle.

Breed clubs define the breed with which the club is associated in a document called a breed standard, although there may be multiple breed clubs for the same breed, each defining the breed in a somewhat different manner. Breed clubs are not scientific organisations, nor are breed standards meant to be scientific descriptions of a breed. Any fancier or group of fanciers may start a breed club and write definitions to suit themselves.  Purpose  Dog breed clubs exist to \\"support the preservation and protection\\" of the club's breed.Jack Russell Terrier Club of America, benefits of joining Each club defines for itself what exactly the club will do for the breed, depending on the use of the particular breed that is advocated by the breed club. Breed clubs write the standard for their breed, and independent breed clubs maintain their breed's stud book (other breed clubs are affiliated with a national kennel club, which maintains the stud books of a great many breeds in a central location.) Breed clubs provide information to the public about their breed. Club members agree to a code of ethics overseen by the club and a list of breeders is usually available to help people find a reputable breeder. Breed clubs also sponsor dog shows for their breed, hunting trials for their breed, and other events related to their particular breed. Breed clubs promote the benefits and well-being of their particular breed and often offer events to discuss showing, training, breeding, and hereditary health issues. Clubs might also provide judging seminars to train dog event judges, and show clubs might maintain judging lists. Most breed clubs also schedule dog shows or competitions in various dog sports specifically for the breed, and raise funds for research on breed-specific health issues.  History  Breed clubs for agricultural stock breeds became popular social clubs in England in the late 18th century and early 19th century. The first breed club for chickens, for example, was formed in 1815 as an elite and expensive activity.Sebrights, a breed apart by Ian Kay, published 31 October 2007, Smallholder Magazine By the mid-19th century, dog shows were becoming a pastime in Victorian England, and the bulldog was a popular pet. In order to make the bulldog breed smaller and more gentle, crossbreeding with pugs and other types of dogs was being done, leading to the formation of the first breed club, the Bulldog Club, in 1864, to write a breed standard to prevent what the members felt were undesirable changes to the breed. The club only lasted three years. More breed clubs were formed in England after the founding of the Kennel Club in 1873, starting with a new bulldog breed club in 1875 in London.Early Dog Clubs Membership Membership in a breed club is usually done through an application, in which the prospective member explains his or her interest in the breed, and supplies recommendations from other members. Most individuals join breed clubs in order to participate in the club-sponsored activities. Hobby breeders join breed clubs for access to records and information about the breed, and sign the breed club's code of ethics in order to provide puppy buyers with some assurance of the quality of the puppies from members of the club. However, the breed club has no control over the practices of individuals who are not members of the breed club. Individuals may belong to breed club for different breeds, although belonging to more than one breed club for the same breed is usually frowned upon since the goals of different breed clubs for the same breed may vary. Most breed clubs prohibit mass sales of puppies to brokers and pet shops, so large commercial puppy producers do not belong to breed clubs, although they may register their puppies with a national kennel club. Purchasers of puppies and dogs should research the background and affiliations of kennels.  Forming a breed club  In general, when a newly created \\"rare\\" breed or newly rediscovered landrace or natural breed becomes popular enough, groups of breeders will join together in a club or association, and write a breed standard for their breed. In the standard the club members will define the breed's eternally observable appearance, often in great detail. The standard may also include the breed's observable temperament, and some history of the breed. If members of the breed wish to join a national kennel club, they will write the standard using the national kennel club's format, and will go through an application process (see the Affiliation or independence? section below.) The breed club will obtain or compile the stud book for their breed, which details the descent of all known members of the breed. In addition, members will usually create a code of ethics that will specify details of breeding requirements for member-breeders (although there is no way to make such an ethical code binding on non-members.) With the advent of the internet, a breeder can create a \\"breed club\\" by putting up a web page to advertise their kennel and their newly created \\"rare breed\\". There are also many internet based \\"kennel clubs\\" that will accept such \\"rare breeds\\" with little or no proof that they fit any of the definitions of the term breed, or without any proof that the \\"breed club\\" exists for anything more than to advertise a kennel.  Local and national clubs  Some breeds of dogs have only one breed club. If the breed club does not belong to a national kennel club, the breed club will maintain all records for the breed, especially the stud book. A breed's stud book is the record of all registered dogs of the breed, going back to the breed's foundation stock. For many breeds, there is one national breed club and multiple local breed clubs. The local clubs are members of the national breed club, which in turn may be a member of the national kennel club. Most countries have one national kennel club, which maintains the records of the breeds (stud books) of member clubs in a central location. The national kennel club also trains judges and organizes multiple breed dog shows and other activities. When a breed club writes or changes the standard for its breed, a club which is a member of a national kennel club will submit the standard to the national kennel club for the breed club's country. When the kennel club accepts the standard it is said to be a standard of that national kennel club, but it is originally written by the breed club.  Types of breed clubs   Working and hunting breed clubs  Working and hunting dog breeds have breed clubs that define the appearance of the breed, but emphasize working or hunting ability in the selection of breeding stock (although the dogs must not vary too much in appearance from the breed standard, or they will not be registerable.).\\"Terriers under 10\\" or over 15\\" are ineligible for registration or recording with the JRTCA.\\" The emphasis is placed on hunting ability in the selection of breeding stock. In addition, inbreeding may be regulated. The Jack Russell Terrier Club of America code of ethics specifies that \\"a terrier will be rejected for registration if the inbreeding coefficient is more than 16 percent\\"Jack Russell Terrier code of ethics in an effort to lessen hereditary disease in the breed. Independent working and hunting breed clubs sometimes maintain an open stud book.  Pet and show breed clubs  Dog breeds that are primarily kept as pets may be registered with breed clubs that have competition in dog shows and the breeding of showdogs and pets as their primary purposes. Most of the clubs have a closed stud book. Many dogs that are bred for show and pets are inbred, in order to make them as uniform in appearance as possible. Close inbreeding, called linebreeding, has only recently been recognised as problematic; generations of breeder manuals have recommended close inbreeding to produce a dog that is highly standardised in appearance.Breeding a Litter by Beth J. Finder Harris, Howell Book House, 15 March 1993, , pgs 11, 12 Today, testing for genetic defects before breeding is required by most breed clubs' code of ethics (but not all dog breeders belong to breed clubs, and breed clubs cannot enforce their code on non members, even when the non-members are raising the breed club's breed of dog.) The Scottish Terrier Club of America's code of ethics directs breeders to \\"breed only Scottish Terriers of characteristic type, sound structure and temperament... producing dogs in conformity to the AKC Standard.\\"Scottish Terrier Club of America code of ethics There is no work or hunting requirement or inbreeding prohibitions in this breed, which is primarily kept as a pet and showdog.  Affiliation or independence?  The emphasis on breeding only for appearance in many pet breeds, combined with competitive pressure to breed show-winning dogs, has led in some breeds to extremes in appearance and a loss of working or hunting instincts.The Failed Sussex Spaniel For this reason, many working and hunting dog owners will not join breed clubs associated with national kennel clubs, preferring to maintain their breeds and stud books independently. A disadvantage to this approach is the loss of access to the many events and activities that the national clubs can afford to sponsor. Unless the independent breed club is very large, it can suffer from a lack of funding and lobby support that the national kennel clubs can provide, especially with the issue of breed-specific legislation posing a threat to many breeds. Breed club members that oppose kennel club acceptance may find their breed accepted into the national kennel club when a minority of members and other breeders break away and form a separate club, and then apply for kennel club acceptance through the new club. In the United States, the Australian Shepherd Club of America, the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America, and the United States Border Collie Club opposed recognition of their breeds by the national kennel club, the American Kennel Club. However, separate breed clubs were formed by some fanciers and breeders for each of these breeds, and then those new clubs applied for membership with the AKC and were accepted. The original breed clubs have continued to maintain their own stud books despite the existence of the new breed clubs which have joined the national kennel club. This has created two separate stud books for these breeds, and has divided the breeds.A Short History of the Border Collie and the AKC The kennel club recognition has been compared to a hostile takeover in a Mergers and Acquisitions deal, as national clubs are eager to register popular new breeds. However, there is no way for a breed club to enforce its regulations and code of ethics on non-members of the club.  Other breed organizations  Other dog clubs encompass multiple breeds of the same type, such as the Hunting Retriever Club for retrievers.Hunting Retriever Club Such a club is not usually referred to as a breed club. Crossbred portemanteu-named designer dogs may have affinity groups and clubs that might be called breed clubs, although the dogs are not actually a breed of dog, but are a crossbreed of two breeds. The UK based, Cockapoo Club of GB, has raised standards of ethical breeding by ensuring that Approved Breeders adhere to a Code of Ethics.Cockapoo Club of GB Code of Ethics In the United States, AMBOR is a very active club which organises activities for mixed-breed dogs only.

Sir Philip Nigel Warrington Strong (11 July 18996 July 1983) served as the fourth Bishop of New Guinea from 1936 to 1962 and the fifth Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane from 1962 to 1970, also serving as primate of the Church of England in Australia (now called the Anglican Church of Australia) from 1966. Strong was born in Sutton on the Hill in Derbyshire, the son of the Rev Warrington Strong and Rosamond Wingfield Digby (who was the sister of John Wingfield Digby MP). He was educated at the King's School, Worcester (where he was apparently nicknamed \\"The Bishop\\"http://www.ksw.org.uk/item.asp?cid=442) and at Selwyn College, Cambridge. During World War I he served in France with the Royal Engineers. Ordained in 1923, he initially served as a vicar in impoverished industrial parishes in Leeds and Saint Ignatious Hendon, Sunderland. Bishop of New Guinea He was consecrated a bishop on the Feast of St Simon and St Jude 1936 (28 October), at St Paul's Cathedral (London, UK) by Cosmo Lang, Archbishop of Canterbury. Following his move to Australasia, Strong served as Bishop of New Guinea between 1936 and 1962, remaining in that post throughout World War II and gaining much respect for his steadfastness during the Japanese invasion of that area. It was Strong who issued the call to Anglican clergy and staff to remain in post during the War. A number of them were killed during the War by the Japanese and, in some cases, Papuans; 12 of them were later honoured as the New Guinea Martyrs. Strong announced in 1947, following a synod of the New Guinea church, that 2nd September would be kept as New Guinea Martyrs' Day each year.https://anglicanfocus.org.au/2019/09/02/anglican-church-remembers- missionaries-on-new-guinea-martyrs-day/ A statue of one of the 12, Lucian Tapiedi, is included in the group of 20th century martyrs over the west door of Westminster Abbey in London.

The Roman Catholics of Constantinople at that time dominated the city's maritime trade and financial sector. Although precise numbers are unavailable, the bulk of the Latin community, estimated at 60,000 at the time by Eustathius of Thessalonica, was wiped out or forced to flee. The Genoese and Pisan communities especially were decimated, and some 4,000 survivors were sold as slaves to the (Turkish) Sultanate of Rum. The massacre further worsened relations and increased enmity between the Western and Eastern Christian churches, and a sequence of hostilities between the two followed. Background From the late 11th century, Western merchants, primarily from the Italian city-states of Venice, Genoa and Pisa, had started appearing in the East. The first had been the Venetians, who had secured large-scale trading concessions from Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Subsequent extensions of these privileges and Byzantium's own naval impotence at the time resulted in a virtual maritime monopoly and stranglehold over the Empire by the Venetians. Alexios' grandson, Manuel I Komnenos, wishing to reduce their influence, began to reduce the privileges of Venice while concluding agreements with her rivals: Pisa, Genoa and Amalfi. Gradually, all four Italian cities were also allowed to establish their own quarters in the northern part of Constantinople itself, towards the Golden Horn. The predominance of the Italian merchants caused economic and social upheaval in Byzantium: it accelerated the decline of the independent native merchants in favour of big exporters, who became tied to the landed aristocracy, who in turn increasingly amassed large estates. Together with the perceived arrogance of the Italians, it fueled popular resentment amongst the middle and lower classes both in the countryside and in the cities. The religious differences between the two sides, who viewed each other as schismatics, further exacerbated the problem. The Italians proved uncontrollable by imperial authority: in 1162, for instance, the Pisans together with a few Venetians raided the Genoese quarter in Constantinople, causing much damage. Emperor Manuel subsequently expelled most of the Genoese and Pisans from the city, thus giving the Venetians a free hand for several years. In early 1171, however, when the Venetians attacked and largely destroyed the Genoese quarter in Constantinople, the Emperor retaliated by ordering the mass arrest of all Venetians throughout the Empire and the confiscation of their property. There were also mass rapes and the burning of houses. A subsequent Venetian expedition in the Aegean failed: a direct assault was impossible due to the strength of the imperial forces, and the Venetians agreed to negotiations, which the Emperor stalled intentionally. As talks dragged on through the winter, the Venetian fleet waited at Chios, until an outbreak of the plague forced them to withdraw. The Venetians and the Empire remained at war, with the Venetians prudently avoiding direct confrontation but sponsoring Serb uprisings, besieging Ancona, Byzantium's last stronghold in Italy, and signing a treaty with the Norman Kingdom of Sicily. Relations were only gradually normalized: there is evidence of a treaty in 1179, although a full restoration of relations would only be reached in the mid-1180s. Meanwhile, the Genoese and Pisans profited from the dispute with Venice, and by 1180, it is estimated that up to 60,000 Latins lived in Constantinople. Death of Manuel I and massacre Following the death of Manuel I in 1180, his widow, the Latin princess Maria of Antioch, acted as regent to her infant son Alexios II Komnenos. Her regency was notorious for the favoritism shown to Latin merchants and the big aristocratic land-owners, and was overthrown in April 1182 by Andronikos I Komnenos, who entered the city in a wave of popular support. Almost immediately, the celebrations spilled over into violence towards the hated Latins, and after entering the city's Latin quarter a mob began attacking the inhabitants. Many had anticipated the events and escaped by sea. The ensuing massacre was indiscriminate: neither women nor children were spared, and Latin patients lying in hospital beds were murdered. Houses, churches, and charities were looted. Latin clergymen received special attention, and Cardinal John, the papal legate, was beheaded and his head was dragged through the streets at the tail of a dog.Carroll, Warren (1993). The Glory of Christendom, Front Royal, VA: Christendom Press, pp. 157, 131 Although Andronikos himself had no particular anti-Latin attitude, he allowed the massacre to proceed unchecked.Harris, Jonathan (2006). Byzantium and the Crusades, , pp. 111-112 Andronikos had managed to incite the anti-Latin sentiment of Constantinopolitans, on the grounds that the empress and the protosebastos had bought the Latin support by promising them the chance of plundering the city. Impact The massacre further worsened the image of the Byzantines in the West, and although regular trade agreements were soon resumed between Byzantium and Latin states, the underlying hostility would remain, leading to a spiraling chain of hostilities: a Norman expedition under William II of Sicily in 1185 sacked Thessalonica, the Empire's second largest city, and the German emperors Frederick Barbarossa and Henry VI both threatened to attack Constantinople. The worsening relationship culminated with the brutal sack of the city of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, which led to the permanent alienation of Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholics. The massacre itself however remains relatively obscure, and Catholic historian Warren Carroll notes that \\"Historians who wax eloquent and indignant‚Äîwith considerable reason‚Äîabout the sack of Constantinople ... rarely if ever mention the massacre of the Westerners in ... 1182.\\" The Italian-born translator and Byzantine chancery official Leo Tuscus was among the Latins who survived the massacre.

In 1915, the formal name was changed to the American Film Company. History Samuel S. Hutchinson, president of the American Film Manufacturing Company American Film Company plant in Santa Barbara, California The American Film Manufacturing Company was founded in Chicago in the fall of 1910 by Samuel S. Hutchinson, John Freuler, Charles J. Hite and Harry Aitken, four Midwestern businessmen who joined forces and capital to create the company. Flying \\"A\\" Studios was located in La Mesa, California, from August 12, 1911, to July 6, 1912, using filming locations in La Mesa and other East County areas such as Lakeside, in addition to sites around San Diego. Under the leadership of Allan Dwan, Flying \\"A\\" made over 150 films in San Diego County. The films were usually western adventures, comedies or an occasional local documentary. The Flying A westerns were popular with the public and kept Dwan and his crew extremely busy. The Dwan westerns gave the Flying A the ability to mount large advertising campaigns, create additional films, and become a player in the motion picture industry. While mostly filming in the backcountry near La Mesa, some sets were built behind the Flying A Studios. Dwan would occasionally film a cowboy chase scene and then build a plot around that chase. Dwan's troupe of actors became very popular with the public. The Navy Recruiting Band at the entrance to the American Film Company in Santa Barbara, California, June 1919 In August 1912, Flying \\"A\\" Studios established its western branch in Santa Barbara. Prior to this, three shooting companies were created. Two would work at the studio or surrounding locales of Chicago, while it was the third unit that was sent out to concentrate on westerns. This western unit would move through the southwest with stops in New Mexico, Arizona and finally California. The third unit would eventually settle in the town of La Mesa before moving Northwest to Santa Barbara. California was chosen for its sunny weather, and to avoid the constraints of the \\"Edison Trust\\" (i.e., The Motion Picture Patents Company or MPPC) operating in Chicago and New York. The main reason for choosing Santa Barbara before La Mesa was that the American Film Company wanted to have urban backdrops in some of its movies. During its operation between 1912 and 1917, Flying \\"A\\" Studios was one of the largest motion picture studios in the United States. At the time, this made Santa Barbara a filmmaking center rivaled only by Hollywood. Contract players and directors When the American Film Company was formed in 1910, it culled many performers, directors, scenario writers and crew members from Essanay Studios the Motion Picture Patents Company. Among the directors and writers that worked for American were Frank Beal, Allan Dwan, J. Warren Kerrigan, and Tom Ricketts. In 1913, Wallace Reid directed several society dramas for the company. The company's roster of actors included Dot Farley, Margarita Fischer, Mary Miles Minter and William Russell. Demise In mid-1918, American Film Company lost its primary distributor when Mutual Film folded. The company signed with a new distributor, Path√©, and continued to produce features. Over the next three years, the company's output decreased significantly. In 1921, one of American's most prominent contract players, Margarita Fischer, left the company. American Film Company was dissolved shortly thereafter.

Playing career Dunbar was a second-team All-SEC defensive tackle as a senior at LSU. He was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the eighth round, 209th overall, of the 1990 NFL Draft. Dunbar was out of football in 1990 and 1991, but returned to play for the Orlando Thunder in the World League of American Football in 1992. Dunbar played three seasons in the NFL for the New Orleans Saints in 1993 and Arizona Cardinals in 1994 and 1995. He also played for the Rhein Fire in NFL Europe in 1995. Coaching career Shortly after his playing career ended, Dunbar started coaching at the high school level, first at Opelousas Senior High School in Opelousas, Louisiana in 1996, before moving to Beau Chene High School in Arnaudville, Louisiana in 1997. Dunbar returned to college football in 1998 and 1999 at Division I-AA Nicholls State University as the defensive line coach. In 2000, he returned to his alma mater, LSU as a member of the strength and conditioning program through 2002. In 2003, he was hired as defensive line coach by Oklahoma State's Les Miles and remained in that role through 2003. While at Oklahoma State, Dunbar tutored Kevin Williams during his breakout senior season and helped him become the first Cowboys defensive lineman to be a 1st-round draft pick since Leslie O'Neal 17 years earlier. In 2004, Dunbar moved to the NFL after being hired by Lovie Smith to coach the Chicago Bears defensive line. He helped tutor a young and talented line that included rookie 1st-round pick Tommie Harris and 2nd-rounder Tank Johnson. The Bears led the NFL in 3rd-down defense, allowing opponents to convert at a 30.5% rate while ranking 15th in the NFL in pass defense. In 2005, Dunbar returned to his alma mater, LSU, which had just hired Les Miles as their new head coach. During the 2005 season, Dunbar‚Äôs linemen paved the way for the Tigers defense to rank #5 in the nation in total defense at 276.8 yards per game and 7th in the country in rushing defense at 94.8 yards per game. The defense also allowed only 15.2 points per game, which ranked 8th in the nation, and led the SEC with 39 team sacks. In 2006, Dunbar returned to the NFL and was hired by the Minnesota Vikings new head coach, Brad Childress. Under his tutelage, the so-called \\"Williams Wall\\", consisting of defensive tackle Kevin Williams and nose tackle Pat Williams, led the NFL in defense against the run each year between 2006 and 2008. Over the same period, the Vikings only allowed an average of 70.8 rushing yards per game. He remained with the Vikings through the 2011 season. The New York Jets hired Dunbar on February 13, 2012 to serve as their defensive line coach which he did from 2012 to 2014. In January 2015, Dunbar was hired as defensive line coach for the Buffalo Bills for the 2015 season, but was fired on March 13, 2016 by head coach Rex Ryan after only one season. In May 2016, he was hired as defensive line coach at the University of Alabama under head coach Nick Saban. Dunbar remained in that role for two seasons through 2017. On February 8, 2018, Dunbar was named defensive line coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Gene This gene is located within a D4Z4 repeat array in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q35. The D4Z4 repeat is polymorphic in length; a similar D4Z4 repeat array has been identified on chromosome 10. Each D4Z4 repeat unit has an open reading frame (named DUX4) that contains two homeoboxes; the repeat-array and ORF is conserved in other mammals. There was no evidence for transcription from standard cDNA libraries however RTPCR and in-vitro expression experiments indicate that the ORF is transcribed.  Function  The encoded protein has been reported to function as a transcriptional activator of paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1 (PITX1). Clinical significance DUX is normally expressed in the testes and cleavage-stage embryos. Inappropriate expression of DUX4 in muscle cells is the cause of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.

Roque Agando is the most prominent of a group of volcanic plugs called simply Los Roques, near the centre of the island. The others are named Roque Ojila and Roque Zarcita, and sometimes Roque Carmona and Roque Las Lajas are also included. It rises directly above the main road between the island's capital San Sebasti√°n and Garajonay National Park in the centre, which makes it a popular tourist sight. The summit is not accessible by foot. During the 20th century, some easy rock-climbing routes were established on the peak, but climbing is now banned there, and hiking is restricted to established paths in its vicinity, as it forms part of a protected area. Remains of the indigenous Guanche sacrificial shrines have been found on the summit.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The cartoon was released on October 30, 1948, and stars Daffy Duck. \\"Daffy Dilly\\" is notable for being an early example of a greedy, self-centered Daffy (with some \\"screwball\\" elements), as perfected by Jones. The title is a word play on daffodil. Plot Daffy Duck is a novelty gag salesman operating on the sidewalk of a large city, futilely hawking things like flower squirters, a Joe Miller joke book, a rib-tickler, a chicken inspector badge and a 200-volt electric hand buzzer, inadvertently demonstrating the latter on himself (\\"It's... shocking...\\"). But then he hears a news bulletin on a nearby radio that buzzsaw tycoon J.B. Cubish, who has not laughed in 50 years, and who is on his deathbed, is offering 1 million dollars to anyone who can make him laugh just one more time before he dies. Seeing his chance at a huge payday, Daffy immediately sets off for the Cubish's mansion, but his butler refuses to let him inside. Daffy tries several ways to get around the butler (scaling the wall with a grappling hook, swinging in through the window on a rope, etc.), all of which fail, until Daffy hides himself in a package designed to look like a bottle of champagne (which the butler tries to keep for himself). Caught again, Daffy runs for his life and escapes via dumbwaiter as the butler chases him with an ax and then tries to shoot him with a cannon, which Daffy narrowly avoids. As the butler is about to get rid of him permanently, Daffy accuses him of not wanting Cubish to regain his health. The butler is astounded, but then Daffy accuses him of attempted murder with an elaborate story he invents on the spot (eventually asiding to the audience, \\"What's Humphrey Bogart got that I ain't got?\\"). Having frightened the butler into incoherence, Daffy tricks him into fleeing the mansion in disguise to avoid arrest, which he quickly does. Finally, Daffy makes it to Cubish's bedroom, but before he can even get started, slips on a rug and falls into a tray of food, covering himself in cake which, to Daffy's confusion, causes Cubish to start laughing. In the end, a newspaper reports that laughter has miraculously saved Cubish's life, and Cubish has kept Daffy on as his personal jester, merrily throwing pies at Daffy's face while he stands in front of a target. \\"It's a living,\\" Daffy mutters to the audience.

They were killed in the late 5th century during the persecution of Trinitarian Christians in Proconsular Africa by the Arian Vandals, according to Victor of Vita. These martyrs were killed during the reign of Arian king Hunneric. According to Victor, Denise was a beautiful and widowed noblewoman, who was killed during this persecution. Denise‚Äôs son Majoricus was killed during the same persecution, as well as Denise‚Äôs sister Dativa. Denise was brutally whipped by the authorities. and then died at the stake with her little child, Majoricus, and her sister Dativa. Also killed were Leontia, daughter of Bishop Germanus of Perada (Paradana); a doctor named Emilius or Emelius (‚ÄúEmilianus‚Äù according to Usuard), brother-in-law of Dativa; Tertius, a monk of Byzacena; and Boniface, surnamed Sibidense, who has been identified as Boniface, bishop of Sicilibba in Proconsular Africa. Emilius and Tertius were flayed alive. Two other figures associated with the same persecution were venerated on the same feast day: Servus or Servius, who was martyred at Tuburbium; and Victoria or Victrix, who was tortured at Cucusa (Colusitana, Culcitana). Servus was hung and dropped from ropes and then dragged through the streets, while Victoria was hung from the wrists above a fire. Victoria's husband begged her to abjure her faith and to think of her young children but she refused. Thinking her dead, the authorities left her on the ground. According to the legend, Victoria later recovered and stated that she had been miraculously cured by a young maiden. Veneration Their cult was mentioned in the martyrologies of various ancient churches and in the martyrologies associated with Ado, Florus, and Usuard. The Legendarium associated with the convent of the canons regular at B√∂ddeken records their legend in a codex dating from the 15th century (Biblioteca Teodoriana, Paderborn). The Roman Martyrology commemorates their feast day on December 6, although Servius‚Äô name is recorded on December 7, and Victoria‚Äôs name is completely left out. There was a cult in the late Middle Ages devoted only to Emilianus, which was popular especially in Naples, and at the end of the 14th century, he was chosen as the patron for a local society of pharmacists along with Saint Peregrine.

A contemporary of the Mauser C96 and Borchardt C-93 pistols, the Bergmann failed to achieve the same widespread success, although Bergmann himself later went on to design one of the earliest practical and successful sub-machine guns, the MP-18. The first cartridges in Bergmann pistols were grooveless, with the bullets having a sharp nose to avoid jams. Later pistols, however, have mechanical extractors and cartridges with grooved flanges.

Hendrick Corneliszoon Lonck (or Loncque and Loncq) (born 1568, Roosendaal - 10 October 1634, Amsterdam), a Dutch naval hero, was the first Dutch sea captain to reach the New World. Early years He was born in Roosendaal in the southern Netherlands, of Brabant origin. His parents were Cornelis Pieterszoon Lonck and Dichna Heinrich. He was a full cousin of the Zeeland Vice Admiral Cornelis Symons Son Loncque. In 1604, he married Grietgen Lenaerts in Antwerp. Career In 1606, Lonck captained the Witte Leeuw (White Lion), a 320-ton merchant ship armed for war, and approached the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Near Tadoussac, he boarded two of Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons' ships, pillaging them for cannons, furs, mounts, and munitions. In 1623 and 1624, Lonck participated in the expedition of Admiral Willem de Zoete against the Barbary Coast pirates. Having made admiral by 1628, Lonck, in the service of the Dutch West Indies Company, joined Admiral Piet Hein in the Battle in the Bay of Matanzas, a naval battle during the Eighty Years' War in which a Dutch squadron was able to defeat and capture a Spanish treasure fleet. Lonck replaced Hein in 1629 as captain-general. In 1630, he commanded a Dutch colonizing expedition of 52 ships, 15 sloops, and 3,780 sailors that captured the historic city of Olinda, Brazil on 14 February, followed by the capture of the Brazilian state of Pernambuco after a feeble resistance by Matias de Albuquerque, its Portuguese Governor. It was to be his last voyage, returning to the Netherlands on 20 July 1630. He died in Amsterdam and was buried on 10 October 1634 in the Oude Kerk in Amsterdam.

These were not all weather roads, there were no snow ploughs to keep the roads clear over the winter months, so in the 1950s the larger farm trucks could only make it through a few months of the year. By 1957, the road saw an application of gravel to the surface, and was graded.

Cohen was never charged for his role in the assassination, and was one of the founders of the Sde Boker kibbutz in the Negev Desert, where David Ben-Gurion later lived. While Ben-Gurion lived at Sde Boker, he and Cohen became close friends. Early life and activity Cohen was born in Petah Tikva in 1922, the son of a farmer.Fetherling (2001), p. 101. He was one of two sons born to Yaakov and Bluma Cohen. Cohen grew up in Kfar Saba. He joined the Lehi at age sixteen, and soon became a prominent fighter within the organization.Marton (1994), p. 96. In 1942, after the arrest of a number of Lehi members, Cohen was \\"among the few who remained at large and recruited a new generation\\" of members. During the period, Cohen escaped the authorities despite a $3,000 bounty on his head, and in addition to recruiting new members, he practiced his marksmanship, training for future missions.Marton (1994), p. 89. In September 1942, Cohen helped Lehi leader Yitzhak Shamir escape from a British prison. Cohen smuggled two Polish Army uniforms to Shamir and another prisoner, Eliahu Gilaldi, who disguised themselves in the uniforms and then crawled under the barbed wire surrounding the prison.Marton (1994), pp. 89‚Äì90. For his role in the escape, Cohen became recognized as \\"Lehi's most valued fighter\\". After helping Shamir escape from prison, Cohen became a leader in Lehi. He trained members in the tactics of guerilla warfare, and taught them how to build bombs and land mines.Frank (1963), pp. 125‚Äì6. Moyne assassination In 1944, the leaders of Lehi decided to assassinate Lord Moyne, the British Minister of State for the Middle East. Yitzhak Shamir originally planned the assassination, and chose Eliyahu Bet-Zuri and Eliyahu Hakim to carry it out. Cohen was picked to train the two assassins for their mission, and traveled from Tel Aviv to spend several weeks training the two in Jerusalem.Marton (1994), pp. 96‚Äì97. After the assassination, Cohen became \\"a legend\\" within Lehi,Ilan (1989), p. 209. and a reward was once again offered for his capture.Marton (1994), p. 99. After the attack, Cohen was also involved in planning an attack on Harold MacMichael that failed. Shortly thereafter, Cohen was apprehended by the British and sent to a detention centre in Africa. On July 6, 1948, the British released Cohen, along with a large number of other detainees in response to Israel's independence. Assassination of Bernadotte During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the United Nations mediator, Folke Bernadotte, advocated a plan under which major revisions in territorial holdings would be made in accordance with the November 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, including placing Jerusalem under UN control. Many Israelis opposed these proposals and Lehi leaders decided that Bernadotte's assassination would be the most effective means to prevent their implementation.Staff. \\"Obituary: Yehoshua Zettler\\", Daily Telegraph, May 21, 2009. Lehi saw Bernadotte as a British and Arab puppet, and thus a serious threat to the emerging State of Israel, and feared that the provisional Israeli government would accept his plan, which it considered disastrous. A. Ilan, Bernadotte in Palestine, 1948 (Macmillan, 1989) p194 J. Bowyer Bell, Assassination in International Politics, International Studies Quarterly, vol 16, March 1972, 59‚Äî82. Review of Kati Marton's biography. The Lehi leadership approved the assassination, and Yehoshua Zeitler began to make plans for it. Cohen was chosen to lead the actual attack on Bernadotte and picked two other long-time members: Yitzhak Ben Moshe and Avraham Steinberg, to join him.Marton (1994), p. 210. Cohen began training his team in West Jerusalem in August, practicing with the weapons and tactics they would use in the assassination.Marton (1994), pp. 211‚Äì12. During the planning stage, Zetler and Cohen chose to ambush Bernadotte on a narrow road in the Katamon neighborhood, blocking his vehicle with a Jeep across the road and then attacking.Ilan (1989), p. 212. On September 17, 1948, Cohen and his team put their plan into action. As planned, they placed a Jeep across the road to stop Bernadotte's convoy at around 5:00 PM. Moshe and Steinberg then opened fire on the tires of Bernadotte's vehicle, while Cohen fired inside the car with a MP40 machine gun, killing Bernadotte and his aide, Andre Serot. After the attack, the identity of the assassins remained unclear for some time. Various nations accused each other of complicity in the attack, but eventually it became clear that Lehi was responsible. Although it was an open secret within Lehi and other groups that Cohen was behind the killing, his role was not made public for over forty years. Later life and friendship with Ben-Gurion After the assassination, Cohen was one of the founders of the Sde Boker kibbutz, established in 1952. The kibbutz later became home to David Ben- Gurion, the former Prime Minister of Israel, in 1956. At Sde Boker, Cohen became Ben-Gurion's unofficial bodyguard and confidant, and the two grew very close.Marton (1994), p. 253. According to a New York Times article from 1964, Cohen became Ben-Gurion's \\"closest companion.\\" Cohen also served as the head of security at Sde Boker. Cohen was married and had two children, a son and daughter. Death and revelation of role Cohen's involvement in the assassination of Bernadotte was long-rumored, but was not confirmed during his lifetime. Historian Michael Bar-Zohar claimed for a number of years that Cohen had privately confessed in his role in the attack to Bernadotte, but Cohen never responded to these claims publicly. Cohen died at Sde Boker of a heart attack in 1986 at the age of 64, with his role in the attack still unclear, but in 1988 two of his co-conspirators in the attack, Yehoshua Zettler and Meshulam Markover, publicly confessed to their role in the attacks and confirmed that Cohen killed Bernadotte.Golda Meir, 'My Life'.

The Jacobs School of Engineering is the youngest engineering school of the nation's top nine, the largest by enrollment in the University of California system, and the ninth-largest in the country. More than thirty faculty have been named members of the National Academies. The current dean of the Jacobs School of Engineering is Albert P. Pisano.  History  Engineering programs began at UCSD during the 1964 academic year with a broad applied science department in the areas of aerospace engineering, solid mechanics, bioengineering, and materials science. The first chair of the Department of Aeronautical (later Aerospace) and Mechanical Engineering Sciences (AMES), Sol Penner, recruited numerous experts in their fields from the California Institute of Technology and other established engineering schools, such as William Prager, Forman A. Williams and Paul A. Libby. He would later recollect that \\"Roger Revelle's dream of building a State University with emphasis on distinguished graduate work had immediate appeal for me because it was consonant with what [he] had become familiar at the California Institute of Technology.\\" These recruits included the second and third chairs of the department, John W. Miles and Eric Reissner. During Miles' tenure, the department would be renamed to the Department of Applied Mechanics and Engineering Sciences, distinguishing it from the second engineering department. Founded in 1965 by Henry G. Booker as the Department of Applied Electrophysics, it would be renamed the Department of Applied Physics and Information Science. Both departments quickly achieved international acclaim for the high-quality research they supported. Additionally, undergraduate engineering instruction began in 1968 with a BA degree in information and computer science. Research achievements in the 1970s included faculty member Hannes Alfv√©n's receipt of the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physics and Kenneth Bowles's development of UCSD Pascal. In 1982, UCSD combined the engineering departments into the Division of Engineering, led by the first dean, Lea Rudee. Ten years passed until the Division of Engineering was renamed the School of Engineering. This time, Robert Conn, an expert in plasma physics and semiconductors was chosen to lead the new School. In 1997, when Qualcomm founder and former UCSD engineering professor Irwin Jacobs and his wife Joan Jacobs provided a $15 million endowment for the School, the School went through a final name change leading to the current name in their honor. Six years later, Irwin and Joan Jacobs added to the endowment with a $110 million gift for scholarships, fellowships, and faculty support.Entrepreneur Magazine: Irwin and Joan Jacobs pledge $110 million more to UCSD  Campus  The School of Engineering occupies ten buildings on 20 acres in and around Earl Warren College on the UC San Diego campus. These buildings are Jacobs Hall (Engineering Building Unit 1), Powell-Focht Bioengineering Hall, Atkinson Hall (Calit2), Computer Science and Engineering Building, Engineering Building Unit 2, Structural and Materials Engineering Building, Charles Lee Powell Structural Systems Laboratory, High Bay Physics Building, Science and Engineering Research Facility, and Center for Memory and Recording Research. The primary thoroughfare, Warren Mall, runs from the Geisel Library Snake Path at its western end to EBU 2 at its eastern terminus. Two additional buildings, the Design and Innovation Building and Franklin Antonio Hall, are pending construction.  Public art  Fallen Star overlooks Warren Mall Warren Mall features four recognizable works of public art belonging to the Stuart Collection. The oldest of these, Bruce Nauman's Vices and Virtues, was completed in 1988 as a series of neon signs superimposing the seven deadly sins and seven virtues over the Powell Structural Systems Laboratory. Alexis Smith's Snake Path was built to link Warren Mall to Geisel Library in 1992. Tim Hawkinson's 2005 work Bear frames the academic courtyard north of Warren Mall, and in 2012 Do Ho Suh's Fallen Star was mounted slightly askew on top of Jacobs Hall.  Academics and research  The Jacobs School of Engineering is currently home to six distinct engineering departments, offering eighteen undergraduate majors, sixteen master's degrees, and twelve Ph.D. programs. Undergraduate admission to each of these departments is capped, meaning that applicants who are not directly accepted to the major as freshmen or new transfers must apply for acceptance.  Bioengineering  The Department of Bioengineering was founded in 1994. It began in 1965 under the leadership of Y.C. Fung as part of the Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering Sciences Department, at which time it was the first biomedical engineering program in the nation. In 2016, the department housed 24 faculty, 633 undergraduates, and 245 graduate students. Undergraduates can choose from four majors within the department, namely bioengineering, biotechnology, bioinformatics, and biosystems. The first two majors are ABET-accredited. Programs for students pursuing graduate degrees include a five-year BS/MS, an MAS degree in medical device engineering, MS degrees, PhD degrees, and a joint MD/PhD with the School of Medicine.  Computer Science and Engineering  The Department of Computer Science and Engineering is the largest engineering department in the UC system. It houses 67 faculty, 1,933 undergraduates, and 873 graduate students. The department was spun off in 1987 from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. Undergraduate students in the department may obtain a BS or BA in computer science, a BS in computer engineering, or a BS in bioinformatics. The data science program at UCSD is jointly operated by the CSE, Mathematics, and Cognitive Science departments. Graduate students may obtain an MS, MAS, PhD, or combined BS/MS degree.  Electrical and Computer Engineering  The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering was founded in 1987 as part of the former Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences' split. The department has 52 faculty members, 1,132 undergraduates, and 673 graduate students. Undergraduates may choose a BS program in electrical engineering, engineering physics, or computer engineering, or they can pursue a BA in \\"electrical engineering and society.\\" Graduate students pursuing a master's or PhD can pursue a specialization in applied ocean sciences, applied physics/electronic devices and materials, communication theory and systems/magnetic recording, computer engineering, electronic circuits and systems, intelligent systems, robotics, and control, medical devices and systems, nanoscale devices and systems, photonics, or signal and image processing.  Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering  The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering was founded in 1964 as AMES, the first engineering department at UC San Diego. It was renamed to MAE in 1999. The department has 44 faculty members, 1,092 undergraduates, and 547 graduate students. Undergraduate students pursue BS degrees in aerospace engineering, environmental engineering, and mechanical engineering. Graduate students may obtain MS, MAS, and PhD degrees in the areas of applied and solid mechanics, material sciences, fluid mechanics, energy, thermal sciences, engineering physics, dynamic systems and controls, environmental engineering, biomechanics, and design.  NanoEngineering  The Department of NanoEngineering, founded in 2007, is the youngest engineering department in the Jacobs School. It is the first nanoengineering department in the United States to offer both undergraduate and graduate degree programs. As of 2019, it has 30 faculty members, 722 undergraduates, and 200 graduate students. In fall of 2008, NanoEngineering took administrative control of chemical engineering. The undergraduate nanoengineering program was awarded ABET accreditation in 2010, the first of its kind in the nation to receive such accreditation. Undergraduates can choose an engineering focus in bioengineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, or materials science. Graduate students can obtain MS and PhD degrees in either nanoengineering or chemical engineering.  Structural Engineering  The Department of Structural Engineering split from the former Department of Applied Mechanics and Engineering Sciences in 1999. However, its independence from the department predates this split, as the Structural Systems Research group was separately administered beginning in 1993. Presently, the department has 24 faculty, 517 undergraduates, and 201 graduate students housed in the Structural and Materials Engineering building. Undergraduate students are limited to pursuing a degree in structural engineering. Graduate students may obtain an MS in Structural Engineering or Structural Health Monitoring, as well as a PhD in structural engineering with various specializations.

It saw extensive service in World War I and World War II with the Royal Italian Army. The Model 1910 has a complex and weak firing system which mandates that the pistol ought to use weaker cartridges than pistols of comparable calibre. History Development The creation of a service pistol to supplant the Bodeo Model 1889 began to be rumored in late 1903.Hogg, Ian, Military Small Arms of the 20th Century 7th Edition (2000) p. 59 The pistol was designed by Italian inventor Bethel Abiel Revelli.Fowler, Anthony, Pistols, Revolvers, and Submachine Guns (2007) p. 170 Revelli spent multiple years developing a prototype before patenting his design to Societa Siderugica Glisenti of Turin. The Glisenti company acquired the machinery to begin production from the United Kingdom in 1906 but sold the manufacturing rights to Metallurgica Brescia gi√† Tempini. Original design The Glisenti Model 1910 was originally designed to fire a 7.65√ó22mm bottle-neck cartridge. The pistol being known as the Model 1906 began production in 1908. The Model 1906 failed to impress the Royal Italian Army and was requested to fire a round similar to the German 9√ó19mm Parabellum. The redesign was named the Model 1910 and was formally adopted by the Royal Italian Army. To reduce recoil and because of the pistol's weak design, the Model 1910 had to fire the 9mm Glisenti. The 9mm Glisenti is structurally similar to the 9√ó19mm Parabellum but has a reduced velocity. Description The Model 1910 fires from a locked breech. When fired, the barrel and bolt recoil together. The barrel will stop in a rearward position. The bolt, unlocking itself, will then continue forward, stripping the chamber and driving the barrel forward again. After this action, a wedge will rise from the frame and lock the entire frame back into position. This firing system was not strong and had to fire cartridges weaker than the comparable 9√ó19 Parabellum calibre. The screw at the front of the frame, when undone will allow the removal of a plate on the left side of the pistol granting access to the moving parts within the pistol. This design was not stiff enough to sufficiently support the left side of the barrel extension and after prolonged firing, the left plate was prone to loosening.Hogg, Ian, Pistols of the World 4th Edition (2004) p. 143 The only safety on the pistol was a small lever set in front of the grip. Replacement Metallurgica Brescia gi√† Tempini in 1912 attempted to improve the design of the Model 1910. The improved pistol, referred to as the Brixia, was submitted to the Royal Italian Army for approval.Hogg, Ian, Military Small Arms of the 20th Century 7th Edition (2000) p. 60 The Brixia had a strengthened frame and removed the grip safety but was not a big enough improvement to make a change in the Royal Italian Army. The Brixia was later to be sold to the civilian market but the outbreak of World War I led to the cancellation of the project. The Glisenti remained in production until the early 1920s. In increasing numbers from 1916 onward, the Glisenti began to be phased out by the Spanish produced Ruby pistol and Beretta M1915. The Beretta later became the official service pistol in the Royal Italian Army in 1934. The Glisenti was declared obsolete the same year but saw limited service in World War II.

Internal combustion engines are often cooled by circulating a liquid called engine coolant through the engine block, where it is heated, then through a radiator where it loses heat to the atmosphere, and then returned to the engine. Engine coolant is usually water-based, but may also be oil. It is common to employ a water pump to force the engine coolant to circulate, and also for an axial fan to force air through the radiator.  Automobiles and motorcycles  Coolant being poured into the radiator of an automobile In automobiles and motorcycles with a liquid-cooled internal combustion engine, a radiator is connected to channels running through the engine and cylinder head, through which a liquid (coolant) is pumped. This liquid may be water (in climates where water is unlikely to freeze), but is more commonly a mixture of water and antifreeze in proportions appropriate to the climate. Antifreeze itself is usually ethylene glycol or propylene glycol (with a small amount of corrosion inhibitor). A typical automotive cooling system comprises: * a series of galleries cast into the engine block and cylinder head, surrounding the combustion chambers with circulating liquid to carry away heat; * a radiator, consisting of many small tubes equipped with a honeycomb of fins to dissipate heat rapidly, that receives and cools hot liquid from the engine; * a water pump, usually of the centrifugal type, to circulate the coolant through the system; * a thermostat to control temperature by varying the amount of coolant going to the radiator; * a fan to draw cool air through the radiator. The radiator transfers the heat from the fluid inside to the air outside, thereby cooling the fluid, which in turn cools the engine. Radiators are also often used to cool automatic transmission fluids, air conditioner refrigerant, intake air, and sometimes to cool motor oil or power steering fluid. Radiators are typically mounted in a position where they receive airflow from the forward movement of the vehicle, such as behind a front grill. Where engines are mid- or rear-mounted, it is common to mount the radiator behind a front grill to achieve sufficient airflow, even though this requires long coolant pipes. Alternatively, the radiator may draw air from the flow over the top of the vehicle or from a side-mounted grill. For long vehicles, such as buses, side airflow is most common for engine and transmission cooling and top airflow most common for air conditioner cooling.  Radiator construction  Automobile radiators are constructed of a pair of metal or plastic header tanks, linked by a core with many narrow passageways, giving a high surface area relative to volume. This core is usually made of stacked layers of metal sheet, pressed to form channels and soldered or brazed together. For many years radiators were made from brass or copper cores soldered to brass headers. Modern radiators have aluminum cores, and often save money and weight by using plastic headers with gaskets. This construction is more prone to failure and less easily repaired than traditional materials. Honeycomb radiator tubes An earlier construction method was the honeycomb radiator. Round tubes were swaged into hexagons at their ends, then stacked together and soldered. As they only touched at their ends, this formed what became in effect a solid water tank with many air tubes through it. Some vintage cars use radiator cores made from coiled tube, a less efficient but simpler construction.  Coolant pump  alt= A sectioned view of the cylinder block, radiator and connecting hoses. The hoses link the tops and bottoms of each, without any pump but with an engine-driven cooling fan Radiators first used downward vertical flow, driven solely by a thermosyphon effect. Coolant is heated in the engine, becomes less dense, and so rises. As the radiator cools the fluid, the coolant becomes denser and falls. This effect is sufficient for low-power stationary engines, but inadequate for all but the earliest automobiles. All automobiles for many years have used centrifugal pumps to circulate the engine coolant because natural circulation has very low flow rates. Heater A system of valves or baffles, or both, is usually incorporated to simultaneously operate a small radiator inside the vehicle. This small radiator, and the associated blower fan, is called the heater core, and serves to warm the cabin interior. Like the radiator, the heater core acts by removing heat from the engine. For this reason, automotive technicians often advise operators to turn on the heater and set it to high if the engine is overheating, to assist the main radiator. Temperature control = Waterflow control = Car engine thermostat The engine temperature on modern cars is primarily controlled by a wax-pellet type of thermostat, a valve which opens once the engine has reached its optimum operating temperature. When the engine is cold, the thermostat is closed except for a small bypass flow so that the thermostat experiences changes to the coolant temperature as the engine warms up. Engine coolant is directed by the thermostat to the inlet of the circulating pump and is returned directly to the engine, bypassing the radiator. Directing water to circulate only through the engine allows the engine to reach optimum operating temperature as quickly as possible whilst avoiding localised \\"hot spots.\\" Once the coolant reaches the thermostat's activation temperature, it opens, allowing water to flow through the radiator to prevent the temperature rising higher. Once at optimum temperature, the thermostat controls the flow of engine coolant to the radiator so that the engine continues to operate at optimum temperature. Under peak load conditions, such as driving slowly up a steep hill whilst heavily laden on a hot day, the thermostat will be approaching fully open because the engine will be producing near to maximum power while the velocity of air flow across the radiator is low. (The velocity of air flow across the radiator has a major effect on its ability to dissipate heat.) Conversely, when cruising fast downhill on a motorway on a cold night on a light throttle, the thermostat will be nearly closed because the engine is producing little power, and the radiator is able to dissipate much more heat than the engine is producing. Allowing too much flow of coolant to the radiator would result in the engine being over cooled and operating at lower than optimum temperature, resulting in decreased fuel efficiency and increased exhaust emissions. Furthermore, engine durability, reliability, and longevity are sometimes compromised, if any components (such as the crankshaft bearings) are engineered to take thermal expansion into account to fit together with the correct clearances. Another side effect of over-cooling is reduced performance of the cabin heater, though in typical cases it still blows air at a considerably higher temperature than ambient. The thermostat is therefore constantly moving throughout its range, responding to changes in vehicle operating load, speed and external temperature, to keep the engine at its optimum operating temperature. On vintage cars you may find a bellows type thermostat, which has a corrugated bellows containing a volatile liquid such as alcohol or acetone. These types of thermostats do not work well at cooling system pressures above about 7 psi. Modern motor vehicles typically run at around 15 psi, which precludes the use of the bellows type thermostat. On direct air-cooled engines this is not a concern for the bellows thermostat that controls a flap valve in the air passages. = Airflow control = Other factors influence the temperature of the engine, including radiator size and the type of radiator fan. The size of the radiator (and thus its cooling capacity) is chosen such that it can keep the engine at the design temperature under the most extreme conditions a vehicle is likely to encounter (such as climbing a mountain whilst fully loaded on a hot day). Airflow speed through a radiator is a major influence on the heat it dissipates. Vehicle speed affects this, in rough proportion to the engine effort, thus giving crude self- regulatory feedback. Where an additional cooling fan is driven by the engine, this also tracks engine speed similarly. Engine-driven fans are often regulated by a fan clutch from the drivebelt, which slips and reduces the fan speed at low temperatures. This improves fuel efficiency by not wasting power on driving the fan unnecessarily. On modern vehicles, further regulation of cooling rate is provided by either variable speed or cycling radiator fans. Electric fans are controlled by a thermostatic switch or the engine control unit. Electric fans also have the advantage of giving good airflow and cooling at low engine revs or when stationary, such as in slow-moving traffic. Before the development of viscous-drive and electric fans, engines were fitted with simple fixed fans that drew air through the radiator at all times. Vehicles whose design required the installation of a large radiator to cope with heavy work at high temperatures, such as commercial vehicles and tractors would often run cool in cold weather under light loads, even with the presence of a thermostat, as the large radiator and fixed fan caused a rapid and significant drop in coolant temperature as soon as the thermostat opened. This problem can be solved by fitting a radiator blind (or radiator shroud) to the radiator that can be adjusted to partially or fully block the airflow through the radiator. At its simplest the blind is a roll of material such as canvas or rubber that is unfurled along the length of the radiator to cover the desired portion. Some older vehicles, like the World War I-era S.E.5 and SPAD S.XIII single-engined fighters, have a series of shutters that can be adjusted from the driver's or pilot's seat to provide a degree of control. Some modern cars have a series of shutters that are automatically opened and closed by the engine control unit to provide a balance of cooling and aerodynamics as needed.Kerr, Jim. \\"Auto Tech: Radiator shutters\\", autos.ca, April 6, 2011, accessed April 12, 2011. Cooling fan of radiator for prime mover of a VIA Rail locomotive These AEC Regent III RT buses are fitted with radiator blinds, seen here covering the lower half of the radiators. Coolant pressure Because the thermal efficiency of internal combustion engines increases with internal temperature, the coolant is kept at higher-than-atmospheric pressure to increase its boiling point. A calibrated pressure-relief valve is usually incorporated in the radiator's fill cap. This pressure varies between models, but typically ranges from .Tridon, Radiator Caps As the coolant system pressure increases with a rise in temperature, it will reach the point where the pressure relief valve allows excess pressure to escape. This will stop when the system temperature stops rising. In the case of an over-filled radiator (or header tank) pressure is vented by allowing a little liquid to escape. This may simply drain onto the ground or be collected in a vented container which remains at atmospheric pressure. When the engine is switched off, the cooling system cools and liquid level drops. In some cases where excess liquid has been collected in a bottle, this may be 'sucked' back into the main coolant circuit. In other cases, it is not.  Engine coolant  Before World War II, engine coolant was usually plain water. Antifreeze was used solely to control freezing, and this was often only done in cold weather. Development in high-performance aircraft engines required improved coolants with higher boiling points, leading to the adoption of glycol or water-glycol mixtures. These led to the adoption of glycols for their antifreeze properties. Since the development of aluminium or mixed-metal engines, corrosion inhibition has become even more important than antifreeze, and in all regions and seasons. Boiling or overheating An overflow tank that runs dry may result in the coolant vaporizing, which can cause localized or general overheating of the engine. Severe damage can result, such as blown headgaskets, and warped or cracked cylinder heads or cylinder blocks. Sometimes there will be no warning, because the temperature sensor that provides data for the temperature gauge (either mechanical or electrical) is exposed to water vapor, not the liquid coolant, providing a harmfully false reading. Opening a hot radiator drops the system pressure, which may cause it to boil and eject dangerously hot liquid and steam. Therefore, radiator caps often contain a mechanism that attempts to relieve the internal pressure before the cap can be fully opened. History The invention of the automobile water radiator is attributed to Karl Benz. Wilhelm Maybach designed the first honeycomb radiator for the Mercedes 35hp. Supplementary radiators It is sometimes necessary for a car to be equipped with a second, or auxiliary, radiator to increase the cooling capacity, when the size of the original radiator cannot be increased. The second radiator is plumbed in series with the main radiator in the circuit. This was the case when the Audi 100 was first turbocharged creating the 200. These are not to be confused with intercoolers. Some engines have an oil cooler, a separate small radiator to cool the engine oil. Cars with an automatic transmission often have extra connections to the radiator, allowing the transmission fluid to transfer its heat to the coolant in the radiator. These may be either oil-air radiators, as for a smaller version of the main radiator. More simply they may be oil-water coolers, where an oil pipe is inserted inside the water radiator. Though the water is hotter than the ambient air, its higher thermal conductivity offers comparable cooling (within limits) from a less complex and thus cheaper and more reliable oil cooler. Less commonly, power steering fluid, brake fluid, and other hydraulic fluids may be cooled by an auxiliary radiator on a vehicle. Turbo charged or supercharged engines may have an intercooler, which is an air-to-air or air-to-water radiator used to cool the incoming air charge --not to cool the engine.  Aircraft  Aircraft with liquid-cooled piston engines (usually inline engines rather than radial) also require radiators. As airspeed is higher than for cars, these are efficiently cooled in flight, and so do not require large areas or cooling fans. Many high-performance aircraft however suffer extreme overheating problems when idling on the ground - a mere 7 minutes for a Spitfire. This is similar to Formula 1 cars of today, when stopped on the grid with engines running they require ducted air forced into their radiator pods to prevent overheating.  Surface radiators  Reducing drag is a major goal in aircraft design, including the design of cooling systems. An early technique was to take advantage of an aircraft's abundant airflow to replace the honeycomb core (many surfaces, with a high ratio of surface to volume) by a surface mounted radiator. This uses a single surface blended into the fuselage or wing skin, with the coolant flowing through pipes at the back of this surface. Such designs were seen mostly on World War I aircraft. As they are so dependent on airspeed, surface radiators are even more prone to overheating when ground-running. Racing aircraft such as the Supermarine S.6B, a racing seaplane with radiators built into the upper surfaces of its floats, have been described as \\"being flown on the temperature gauge\\" as the main limit on their performance. Surface radiators have also been used by a few high-speed racing cars, such as Malcolm Campbell's Blue Bird of 1928. Pressurized cooling systems Radiator caps for pressurized automotive cooling systems. Of the two valves, one prevents the creation of a vacuum, the other limits the pressure. It is generally a limitation of most cooling systems that the cooling fluid not be allowed to boil, as the need to handle gas in the flow greatly complicates design. For a water cooled system, this means that the maximum amount of heat transfer is limited by the specific heat capacity of water and the difference in temperature between ambient and 100¬∞C. This provides more effective cooling in the winter, or at higher altitudes where the temperatures are low. Another effect that is especially important in aircraft cooling is that the specific heat capacity changes with pressure, and this pressure changes more rapidly with altitude than the drop in temperature. Thus, generally, liquid cooling systems lose capacity as the aircraft climbs. This was a major limit on performance during the 1930s when the introduction of turbosuperchargers first allowed convenient travel at altitudes above 15,000 ft, and cooling design became a major area of research. The most obvious, and common, solution to this problem was to run the entire cooling system under pressure. This maintained the specific heat capacity at a constant value, while the outside air temperature continued to drop. Such systems thus improved cooling capability as they climbed. For most uses, this solved the problem of cooling high-performance piston engines, and almost all liquid-cooled aircraft engines of the World War II period used this solution. However, pressurized systems were also more complex, and far more susceptible to damage - as the cooling fluid was under pressure, even minor damage in the cooling system like a single rifle-calibre bullet hole, would cause the liquid to rapidly spray out of the hole. Failures of the cooling systems were, by far, the leading cause of engine failures. Evaporative cooling Although it is more difficult to build an aircraft radiator that is able to handle steam, it is by no means impossible. The key requirement is to provide a system that condenses the steam back into liquid before passing it back into the pumps and completing the cooling loop. Such a system can take advantage of the specific heat of vaporization, which in the case of water is five times the specific heat capacity in the liquid form. Additional gains may be had by allowing the steam to become superheated. Such systems, known as evaporative coolers, were the topic of considerable research in the 1930s. Consider two cooling systems that are otherwise similar, operating at an ambient air temperature of 20¬∞C. An all-liquid design might operate between 30¬∞C and 90¬∞C, offering 60¬∞C of temperature difference to carry away heat. An evaporative cooling system might operate between 80¬∞C and 110¬∞C, which at first glance appears to be much less temperature difference, but this analysis overlooks the enormous amount of heat energy soaked up during the generation of steam, equivalent to 500¬∞C. In effect, the evaporative version is operating between 80¬∞C and 560¬∞C, a 480¬∞C effective temperature difference. Such a system can be effective even with much smaller amounts of water. The downside to the evaporative cooling system is the area of the condensers required to cool the steam back below the boiling point. As steam is much less dense than water, a correspondingly larger surface area is needed to provide enough airflow to cool the steam back down. The Rolls-Royce Goshawk design of 1933 used conventional radiator-like condensers and this design proved to be a serious problem for drag. In Germany, the G√ºnter brothers developed an alternative design combining evaporative cooling and surface radiators spread all over the aircraft wings, fuselage and even the rudder. Several aircraft were built using their design and set numerous performance records, notably the Heinkel He 119 and Heinkel He 100. However, these systems required numerous pumps to return the liquid from the spread-out radiators and proved to be extremely difficult to keep running properly, and were much more susceptible to battle damage. Efforts to develop this system had generally been abandoned by 1940. The need for evaporative cooling was soon to be negated by the widespread availability of ethylene glycol based coolants, which had a lower specific heat, but a much higher boiling point than water.  Radiator thrust  An aircraft radiator contained in a duct heats the air passing through, causing the air to expand and gain velocity. This is called the Meredith effect, and high-performance piston aircraft with well-designed low-drag radiators (notably the P-51 Mustang) derive thrust from it. The thrust was significant enough to offset the drag of the duct the radiator was enclosed in and allowed the aircraft to achieve zero cooling drag. At one point, there were even plans to equip the Spitfire with an afterburner, by injecting fuel into the exhaust duct after the radiator and igniting it. Afterburning is achieved by injecting additional fuel into the engine downstream of the main combustion cycle. Stationary plant Engines for stationary plant are normally cooled by radiators in the same way as automobile engines. However, in some cases, evaporative cooling is used via a cooling tower.

The radiator depicted here also serves as a handy towel rack and warmer. Radiators and convectors are heat exchangers designed to transfer thermal energy from one medium to another for the purpose of space heating. Denison Olmsted of New Haven, Connecticut, appears to have been the earliest person to use the term 'radiator' to mean a heating appliance in an 1834 patent for a stove with a heat exchanger which then radiated heat. In the patent he wrote that his invention was a peculiar kind of apparatus, which I call a radiator. The heating radiator was invented by Franz San Galli in 1855, a Prussian-born Russian businessman living in St. Petersburg.Family Sangalli / San Galli In the late 1800s, companies, such as the American Radiator Company, promoted cast iron radiators over previous fabricated steel designs in order to lower costs and expand the market.  Radiation vs. convection  In practice, the term radiator refers to any of a number of devices in which a fluid circulates through exposed pipes (often with fins or other means of increasing surface area), notwithstanding that such devices tend to transfer heat mainly by convection and might logically be called convectors. The terms convection heater or convector refers to a class of devices in which the source of heat is not directly exposed. As domestic safety and the supply from water heaters keeps temperatures relatively low, radiation is inefficient in comparison to convection. Convection heaters also work differently from electric radiators in that they disperse heat differently.  Application  Hotwater baseboard-style radiator (top) which is covered (left) and opened (right), with inside view (below) showing the aluminium fins which are attached in series to the copper pipe.  Hot water  A hot-water radiator consists of a sealed hollow metal container filled with hot water by gravity feed, a pressure pump, or convection. As it gives out heat, the hot water cools and sinks to the bottom of the radiator and is forced out of a pipe at the other end. Anti-hammer devices are often installed to prevent or minimize knocking in hot water radiator pipes. = Hot-water baseboard = Traditional cast iron radiators are no longer common in new construction, replaced mostly with forced hot water baseboard style radiators. They consist of copper pipes which have aluminium fins to increase their surface area. These conduction boiler systems use conduction to transfer heat from the water into the metal radiators or convectors. The radiators are designed to heat the air in the room using convection to transfer heat from the radiators to the surrounding air. They do this by drawing cool air in at the bottom, warming the air as it passes over the radiator fins, and discharging the heated air at the top. This sets up convective loops of air movement within a room. If the register is blocked either from above or below, this air movement is prevented, and the heater will not work. Baseboard heating systems are sometimes fitted with moveable covers to allow the resident to fine-tune heating by room, much like air registers in a central air system.  Steam  Single-pipe steam radiator Steam has the advantage of flowing through the pipes under its own pressure without the need for pumping. For this reason, it was adopted earlier, before electric motors and pumps became available. Steam is also far easier to distribute than hot water throughout large, tall buildings like skyscrapers. However, the higher temperatures at which steam systems operate make them inherently less efficient, as unwanted heat loss is inevitably greater. Steam pipes and radiators are prone to producing banging sounds called steam hammer. The bang is created when some of the steam condenses into water in a horizontal section of the steam piping. Subsequently, steam picks up the water, forms a \\"slug\\" and hurls it at high velocity into a pipe fitting, creating a loud hammering noise and greatly stressing the pipe. This condition is usually caused by a poor condensate drainage strategy and is often caused by buildings settling and the resultant pooling of condensate in pipes and radiators that no longer tilt slightly back towards the boiler.  Fan-assisted heat exchanger  A fan-assisted radiator contains a heat exchanger fed by hot water from the heating system. A thermostatic switch energises an electric fan which blows air over the heat exchanger to circulate it in a room. Its advantages are small relative size and even distribution of heat. Disadvantages are fan noise and the need for both a source of heat and a separate electrical supply.  Underfloor  In underfloor heating, tubing is placed on the floor throughout the room and later covered with a concrete layer during construction. Also known as \\"radiant heat\\", underfloor heating uses a network of pipes, tubing or heating cables, buried in or attached beneath a floor to allow heat to rise into the room. Best results are achieved with conductive flooring materials such as tile. The large surface area of such room-sized radiators allows them to be kept just a few degrees above desired room temperature, minimizing convection. Underfloor heating is more expensive in new construction than less efficient systems. It also is generally difficult to retrofit into existing buildings. The Roman hypocaust employed a similar principle of operation.  Skirting-board heating  Skirting-board radiators are a form of heating which involves placing radiators inside a skirting board. Hot water is piped though the system, usually taken directly from the central heating system.

Following the 1931 collapse of Durant, a group having interest in Durant Motors began assembling their own cars, the De Vaux-Hall Motors Company, using the Durant body dies, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Oakland, California, and under the De Vaux brand name. When De Vaux-Hall collapsed in 1932, unable to pay creditors, Continental Motors assumed automobile assembly and marketed the vehicles under the Continental-De Vaux brand name for the balance of the 1932 model year. Continental Motors introduced a completely new line of Continental-branded automobiles for 1933. These cars were not based upon the 1931 De Vaux, a product of the De Vaux-Hall, which had been using body dies left over from the former Durant produced by Durant Motors until 1930. The 1933 Continentals were marketed in three model ranges: the largest and most expensive was the six-cylinder Ace, next was a smaller six called the Flyer and also the low-priced four-cylinder Beacon. The 1933 Beacon roadster was the lowest price full-size car offered for sale in the United States in the 1930s, costing only $US335. None of these met with success in the depression era economy. At this same time, Dominion Motors Ltd. of Canada was building the same Flyer and Beacon cars under arrangement with Continental for sale in the Canadian market, and importing the larger Ace models. Dominion then converted to building Reo brand trucks. The Ace and Flyer models were discontinued at the close of the 1933 model year. Finding that its cars were unprofitable, Continental stopped assembling even Beacon automobiles in 1934. Kaiser, working with a Continental-designed engine, introduced the USA's first mass- produced OHC inline six-cylinder engine. It debuted in Kaiser-owned Jeep Corporation vehicles in the mid-1960s. However, Stutz built both single and dual overhead cam inline six-cylinder engines in, respectively, the late 1920s and early 1930s (sohc) and the early 1930s (dohc). Moreover, these were fitted in Stutz production cars (though their numbers were comparatively small). Particular models of John Deere tractors are currently being supplied by Continental since the ownership transfer to Korea, as stated on the tractor's engine identification plate.

Inline: several conventional gasoline I6s were built for trucks, the COA331 (licensed from REO), 6602, 22R, and AO895 (also used in some armored vehicles). Later the M-A-N licensed multifuel LDS427, LD465 and turbocharged LDT465 were developed, also for use in trucks. Radial: in the late 1930s 7 and 9 cylinder air cooled radial aircraft engines were adapted for use in armored vehicles. The W670 and R975 were considered very reliable by the British in North Africa, but were not developed further. Opposed: just after WWII an air cooled O6 was developed for armored vehicles. All were supercharged, AOS895-3 models had carburetors, -5 models had fuel injection with no increase in power, but greater fuel mileage. V type: in the early 1950s an air cooled V12 engine was introduced for armored vehicles. Later the AVSI-1790 was developed into the AVDS-1790 diesel version, which was often retro-fitted to earlier vehicles.

History Sergey Korovin designed the first 7.65 mm calibre military pistol around 1922, while working at the famous Tula arms factory TOZ. However, this model proved too complex and difficult. But in 1925 the sport society Dinamo placed an order for a 6.35 mm pocket pistol for sports and civic needs. By 1926, Korovin completed development of a model, and at the end of that year, TOZ began its release.

It was chambered in .32 ACP and, from 1913 until 1920, in .380 ACP. Although smaller in size, it is derived from the .45 semi- automatic pistol Savage submitted to the 1906-1911 US Army trials to choose a new semi-automatic sidearm. After several years of testing the Savage pistol was one of two finalists but ultimately lost to the Colt entry, which became famous as the Colt Model 1911. 181 of these .45 ACP pistols were returned to Savage after the testing and sold on the civilian market. Name and marketing The Model 1907 is often erroneously called a Model 1905 because of the date Nov. 21, 1905 date stamped into the top of the slide on all Savage semi-automatic pistols. This is the date Elbert Searle was awarded one of his firearm patents, which were the design basis for all the Savage semi-automatic pistols. Advertised with the slogan \\"Ten shots quick!\\", the Model 1907 was very popular because, despite its small size, it had a 10-round double-stack magazine. The advertising included a number of early celebrity endorsers, including William \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody, Bat Masterson, and the Pinkerton Agency. Savage Arms also presented Teddy Roosevelt with a Model 1907. Much of the advertising in the popular press played on the ability of an otherwise defenseless woman to use the Savage to subdue burglars and \\"tramps\\". Design A safety lever is located on the left side of the pistol, at the upper rear of the grip. Though it appears to have an external hammer, it is actually a striker-fired gun; the \\"hammer\\" is actually a cocking lever. Model 1907s made from 1913 until 1917 had a collared barrel and a loaded chamber indicator, allowing the shooter to tell by touching the shell ejection port whether a cartridge was chambered. The Model 1907 uses no screws (even the grips snap into place) and is simple to strip. The grips were made from gutta- percha, though some early production examples had metal grips. In 1912 the Model 1907 underwent a major design revision modifying almost every major component. As with most semi-automatics, the pistol is readied for firing by pulling back and releasing the slide, which inserts a cartridge into the chamber and cocks the pistol. The recoil from firing a cartridge automatically extracts and ejects the empty shell, cocks the firing pin and loads another cartridge into the chamber, ready for firing. Variants Savage made two other very similar semi-automatic pistols, with many parts in common with the Model 1907. The first was the hammerless Model 1915; the .32 Model 1915 was made only in 1915 and 1916 and the .380 model from 1915 until 1917. Like the Model 1907, the Model 1915 uses no screws. The other is the Model 1917, made from 1920 until 1926 in .32 and from 1920 until 1928 in .380. The Model 1917 is mechanically the same as and shares almost all of its parts with the final version of the Model 1907 (including a smaller, thinner cocking lever \\"hammer\\"), but with a significantly larger handle. Because this required larger grips, the Model 1917 uses one screw through each grip to hold them to the pistol frame. A prototype run of about 40 smaller vest pocket pistols chambered in .25 ACP were made in 1912. While the cosmetic styling was very similar, mechanically they were quite different. These pistols operated by simple blowback with a fixed rather than rotating barrel, and there was no cocking lever \\"hammer\\" as on the larger Model 1907. While the design was successful, for unknown reasons it was never put into production or marketed by Savage. Military use Although the Model 1907 was designed for civilian use, the French government purchased over 40,000 .32 ACP Model 1907s between late 1914 and 1917 for the French military in World War I. These military \\"contract\\" pistols are recognized by the presence of a loaded chamber indicator and a lanyard ring, or mounting holes in the grip for a lanyard ring; lanyard rings were not available on civilian pistols. The Savage Model 1907 pictured to the right is a French contract pistol. A much smaller contract of 1,150 pistols in the same configuration were purchased by Portugal, which are distinguished by grips bearing the lesser arms of Portugal instead of the standard Indian head. In popular culture In the 1978 film noir parody The Cheap Detective, Sid Caesar's character, Ezra Desire, uses a model 1907, as does Jude Law's character Harlan Maquire in the 2002 crime drama Road to Perdition.

Osborn was a wooden steam barge that sank in Lake Superior in 1884 with the loss of five lives. The Osborn was just 2 years old when the larger, steel-hulled Alberta, which was called a \\"steel monster\\" and \\"terror of the lakes\\", rammed her. The wreck of the Osborn was discovered 100 years after her sinking. The wreck was illegally salvaged in the 1980s. Many of Osborn's artifacts became the property of the State of Michigan after they were seized from Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. The State allows the museum to display the artifacts as a loan. The wreck of the Osborn is now protected by the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve as part of an underwater museum. Construction The Osborn before she sank The John M. Osborn was a propeller wooden steam barge built in 1882 by Morley and Hill in Marine City, Michigan. She was then rebuilt in 1884 in Cleveland, Ohio for increased tonnage. She was owned by George F. Cleveland and the Cleveland Mining Ore Company. Final voyage Captain Thomas Wilford's wife Fannie and his two daughters, Cora and Adelaide were on board the Osborn on her final day of 27 July 1884. They enjoyed a sunny day walking the deck, attending Sunday school services, and talking to the sailors, including the mate, George F. Cleveland, who also owned the Osborn. The children were to put to bed as night fell and a thick fog developed. Mrs. Fannie Wilford was uneasy and stayed near her husband's side on deck near the bow. The wooden Osborn was downbound for the Soo Locks with a cargo of 1,120 tons of iron ore and towing two schooner barges, the George W. Davis and the Thomas Gawn.Stonehouse, Frederick (1973). \\"The Great Wrecks of the Great lake: A directory of the shipwrecks of Lake Superior\\", p. 53. The Book Concern, Printers, Hancock, Michigan, USA. LCCN 73-75623. The Alberta was upbound with her usual number of passengers and freight on her regular run between Owen Sound, Ontario and Port Arthur, Ontario. The Osborn carefully whistled her approach through the fog but one ship whistled once for a starboard course and the other ship whistled twice for a port course. Shipwreck historian Frederick Stonehouse wrote: > As reported in the local papers, 'the barge blew three whistles, the Alberta > answering, and checked down to seven miles per hour, but in a moment the > Osborn appeared under the Alberta's bow and the latter struck her midway > between the main and mizzen masts on the starboard side, cutting her almost > in twain.' When the larger , 2,282 ton, steel steamer Alberta rammed the smaller , 891 ton, wooden Osborn, she penetrated to the center of the ship cutting her almost in two. The large gash in the Osborn's hull caused the water to hit her hot boilers which exploded and immediately killed two crewmen. Alberta stayed locked with Osborn long enough for Captain Wilford and his wife to transfer to her. One of the Alberta's passengers jumped to the Osborn to save three lives, including Captain Wilford's children. While this rescuer from Alberta was still below decks, the Osborn broke free and sank, taking his life along with those of two crewmen. Following the collision, the press vilified Alberta. In her first year of service, she was involved in four minor collisions and a fifth major collision that sank the Osborn. The Cleveland News Leader said of the Alberta, \\"This huge steel monster, during the few months she has been afloat has become the terror of the lakes. Proud of her reputation as one of the fastest side-wheel steamers on fresh water, she has been run in an extraordinarily reckless manner.\\" The Buffalo Daily Courier reported, \\"Since the collision much has been said about [the Alberta] being cumbersome and unwieldy, to which the accident was partially attributed. A lawsuit brought by the owners of the Osborn and her cargo lasted nearly three years. The United States District Court ruled both vessels were at fault for excessive speed for conditions. The Osborn loss was about $88,000 and the Alberta's damages was about $20,000. Following admiralty rule for both vessels at fault, the damages were divided by deducting the Alberta's loss from the Osborn's loss, and equally dividing the remainder with the pecuniary result being that Alberta's owners paid the owners of Osborn, and her cargo $33,000. Years later Stonehouse concurred that thick fog and both ships traveling too fast for conditions was the likely cause of the disaster. Wreck history The wreck of the John M. Osborn was discovered in 1984, 100 years after she sank; the discoverers were the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society [GLSHS] and the Oddessey Foundation of Lansing, Michigan. In 1985, shipwreck historian Frederick Stonehouse wrote, \\"Reportedly the Osborn is nearly intact and a time capsule of an earlier era of Great Lakes maritime history.\\" However, Great Lakes diver Steve Harrington reported by 1990, \\"The remains of the J.M. Osborn were discovered in the mid-1980s and were quickly stripped for the benefit of a local museum. State officials turned a blind eye to the salvage operation.\\"Harrington, Steve (1990, 1998), p.p. 321 - 333.

The series also features Lucy Lawless. It is produced by White Rock Lake Production and distributed by Sony Pictures Television. The episodes were released on Crackle from March 2 to March 13, 2009. Plot The show is a thriller about the assassin, Eve, who is employed by a ruthless crime family. After suffering a severe head trauma (knife through her head) while on the job, she begins to hallucinate and becomes haunted by her victims. As a result of her injury, Eve is driven to seek revenge on those who ordered the hits in the first place‚Äîher mob employers. History While developing the story about a cold-blooded killer growing a conscience, Brubaker's original idea for the series was a hitman afflicted with brain cancer, but then remembered watching a scene in an old PBS documentary series where a patient walked into the ER with a hunting knife stabbed right through his skull, and drew inspiration from that for Eve's head injury. Angel of Death is Brubaker's first online series. The show reunites Lucy Lawless, Ted Raimi, and Zo√´ Bell - who all worked together on Xena: Warrior Princess. Bell was Lawless's stunt-double on the long-running series. Other formats Once the show finished its original online broadcast, it was released on DVD, with new footage. The DVD was going to be released in June 2009, but instead ended up being released on July 28, 2009. A feature-length compilation of the web series was available for viewing on Hulu until 2017.

Working in film and theater, Rappaport and his company Creature Effects, Inc specialize in creating hyper-realistic make-up effects and animatronic animals, including the horse rode by Tom Cruise in The Last Samurai, and prosthetic makeup effects for 300 and I Am Legend.  Biography  Rappaport was born in Yokohama, Japan. At the age of three, his family moved to the Napa Valley in northern California. He graduated from Justin-Siena High School in Napa and attended San Diego State University where he earned a Bachelor of Science Degree. Upon graduation, he returned to Northern California and worked in law enforcement before meeting and working with Bob Hartman, a San Francisco puppeteer and street performer. His work with Hartman sparked an interest in creating effects for the entertainment industry and he pursued employment at Industrial Light & Magic. At ILM he worked on feature film projects, including Innerspace and Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. From ILM, Rappaport went to work with Chris Walas and created effects for films including The Fly II and Child's Play.  Career  The Last Samurai The production of The Last Samurai required an animatronic horse capable of performing stunt sequences that would put a real horse and rider at risk of great injury. Rappaport was commissioned to build a horse that could seamlessly replace Tom Cruise' real horse for those scenes. Rappaport said \\"It's probably the most sophisticated horse or animatronic creature ever made for film. It cost $1.5 million to make. It gallops in place. It reared up. It fell over. And it looks completely real.\\"La Brea Living, Issue 10, October 2006, Creature Effects, Inc.

This extensive body of work included prosthetic makeups, animatronic animals, props, weaponry and costume elements. In addition to the amazingly lifelike horse effects for this film, Rappaport created an animatronic wolf puppet for scenes where young Leonidas faces off with the predatory animal. \\"The filmmakers shot interactions of the practical puppet attacking young Leonidas in a narrow rock crevice. Veteran creature effects supervisor Mark Rappaport and his team mechanized the puppet with: eye-blinks; head, neck, brow, jaw and tongue movement; saliva tubes and glowing eyes.\\"^Cinefex, Issue 109, April 2007, A Beautiful Death, Joe Fordham http://www.cinefex.com/ Full body, silicone appliance makeup created by Creature Effects, Inc. for the feature film I Am Legend I Am Legend For I Am Legend, starring Will Smith Mark Rappaport developed full body silicone makeups for the primal, aggressive beings known as \\"Darkseekers\\". The translucent makeup creates the look of zombie infection and a spiked metabolism desired by director Francis Lawrence. The makeups were to be applied to very thin performers to create the look of zero body-fat and protruding veins. The makeups included rotten teeth dentures and fully dilated pupil contact lenses. In addition to the creature makeups, Mark's studio created animatronic puppets of the likeness of \\"Sam\\" the German Shepherd, a digitally scan model for the infected dogs, scar and knife wound moulage for Will Smith and numerous other effects for the production. Other Projects After designing and producing a rideable animatronic horse for The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, Mark's Studio created a second ride-able horse for Bedtime Stories. The motion and animatronic features of the two horses were enhanced and refined for True Grit and further developed for Cowboys & Aliens. The animatronic horses are used where the action (if performed by real horses) might put the riders or horses at risk of harm or injury.

Published in 2000 in Chinese by the Writers Publishing House, the book details the rigorous lifestyle that Liu led and includes advice from Liu's parents on how to raise children to gain acceptance to top-tier universities; it has been described as a \\"manual\\" for child-rearing and early education. The book was a bestseller in mainland China and made both Harvard and Liu Yiting household names among Chinese parents and students. It has since had numerous imitators, spawning an entire genre of how-to books on child-rearing for Chinese parents. Biography of Liu Yiting Liu was raised in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province. Liu's parents, believers in the value of early childhood education, subjected her to a rigorous education since she was just 15 days old. For example, to ensure that someone was always talking to Liu, they invited relatives over to the house. They also had her participate in \\"character-building\\" physical exercises such as swimming, jumping rope, and holding ice in her hands for extended periods of time. Liu also acted in a soap opera when she was five years old. While in high school, Liu met then Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher partner Larry L. Simms, a Dartmouth and BU Law alumnus and former U.S. Navy Lieutenant who clerked for Supreme Court justice Byron White and worked as Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel from 1975 to 1985. With Simms' assistance, Liu participated in a student exchange program sponsored by Washington-Beijing Scholastic Exchange, Inc., of which Simms was the founder and President, and visited America in 1998. This experience changed her views about life in America, because like many Chinese citizens, most of her impressions about America came from Hollywood, and when she came to the country she was \\"surprised that [she] didn't see any street fights or police-car chases\\". The program also piqued her interest in American universities, where she realized she would be able to study a variety of subjects. Although they had been training her to attend a preeminent university, Liu's parents had not expected that she would attend an American one; her mother has said that until Liu came back from America, she had not been aware that Chinese students could apply to American universities. At the time, it was unusual for Chinese students to attend American schools as undergraduates, as most only applied to schools abroad for postgraduate education. However, rather than taking the gaokao, China's national college entrance examination, and attending one of the National Key Universities, Liu applied to American colleges with recommendation from Simms. She was accepted to several schools, including Harvard, Columbia, Wellesley, and Mount Holyoke, from which she ultimately chose to attend Harvard. Not long afterwards, a local newspaper announced her acceptance and the family was \\"besieged with thousands of phone calls\\". At Harvard, Liu majored in applied mathematics and economics and earned high grades; she also chaired the Harvard Project for Asian and International Relations, a student organization. She was described as \\"unassuming\\" and a \\"typical student\\", to the point that it took her roommate four years to realize Liu was a celebrity in China. In 2003, Liu graduated and took a job at the Boston Consulting Group in New York City. Synopsis Liu Weihua (Liu's mother) and Zhang Xinwu (Liu's stepfather) published Harvard Girl in 2000, after Liu had matriculated at Harvard. According to Liu, her parents had plans early on to write about their parenting methods, but they waited until 2000 to publish the book, relying on Liu's perceived success to establish themselves as \\"experts\\". The book primarily consists of research-like notes and diary entries, which Liu and her parents began recording and saving before Liu was in first grade. Liu herself helped edit the book, and wrote several of the later chapters. One major element of the child-rearing strategy described in the book was treating Liu as an adult and \\"encourag[ing] her to develop a mature style of thinking\\". Liu's parents never used baby talk when Liu was a child, and they allowed her to argue with them but required her to present reasoned arguments like an adult. According to education scholar Ben Mardell, the book's focus on independent thinking and intellectual development was a \\"break with the past\\" in China, where both early and higher education often emphasize rote learning. In addition, the book details the rigorous \\"character-building exercises\\" Liu's parents had her perform. In addition to having her do physical exercises, Liu's parents controlled her diet. They also frequently took her traveling, both on short trips to nearby rural areas and on longer trips to historical sites such as Xi'an. Throughout the book, high value is placed on \\"full development\\", and the writers encourage parents to cultivate more than just academic ability in their children. The book also includes supplementary chapters on topics such as how to select which schools to apply to, and advice for students on filling out applications and taking TOEFL and SAT exams. Impact The book was at the top of China's bestseller list for 16 months, during which time it sold at least 1.5 million copiesThe exact number of sales is unclear; while it had sold about 1.5 million copies through the publisher by early 2003, it was estimated that 2 million more infringing copies were sold in the same time period (Lin-Liu 2003). and the writers were estimated to have earned at least the equivalent of $100,000 in royalties. It became a must-have book for middle-class parents in China. The popularity of Harvard Girl made Liu a \\"national superstar\\" and an \\"idol\\" for Chinese parents, Âäâ‰∫¶Â©∑ÔºåÂ∑≤ÊàêÁÇ∫Ë®±Â§ö‰∏≠ÂúãÂÆ∂Èï∑ÂøÉÁõÆ‰∏≠ÁöÑÂÅ∂ÂÉèÔºåÊïôËÇ≤ÁöÑÂÅ∂ÂÉè„ÄÇ (English: \\"Liu Yiting has become an idol in the eyes of many Chinese parents, an education idol.\\"). and she frequently received fan mail and drew large crowds at book signings in mainland China. The success of this and similar books (another bestseller in 2001 and 2002 was Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad Poor Dad) in mainland China has been said to reflect a \\"national obsession\\" among Chinese parents to get their children into top-ranking American schools. Harvard Girl was followed by numerous imitations by parents of other successful students, and is said to have spawned an entire genre of education \\"manuals\\" for Chinese parents, including similar books on how to get one's children into schools such as Oxford University, Cambridge University, or Cornell University. Also accessible at International Herald Tribune. This genre includes titles such as Ivy League is Not a Dream, From Andover to Harvard, How We Got Our Child Into Yale, Harvard Family Instruction, The Door of the Elite, Harvard Boy Zhang Zhaomu, Harvard Talents: Children Cultivated by the Karl Weter Educational Law, Tokyo University Boy, Cornell Girl, and Our Dumb Little Boy Goes to Cambridge. Comparable books have also been published in South Korea, although American undergraduate universities are not \\"revered\\" in the same way there as they are in mainland China. In addition to imitators, Liu's parents have written their own follow-up: Harvard Girl 2: Liu Yiting's Studying Methods and Upbringing Details (ÔºúÂìà‰ΩõÂ•≥Â≠©Âàò‰∫¶Â©∑Ôºû‰πã‰∫åÔºö Âàò‰∫¶Â©∑ÁöÑÂ≠¶‰π†ÊñπÊ≥ïÂíåÂüπÂÖªÁªÜËäÇ), which describes Liu's four years in college, was published in 2004 by Writers Publishing House. Âåó‰∫¨Â®±‰πê‰ø°Êä• (Beijing Yule Newspaper). The book also affected applications to Harvard. It made Harvard a household name in China, and books of this genre caused a significant increase in the number of Chinese applicants to top-tier American universities. In 1999, Liu and 43 other Chinese students applied to Harvard, and by 2008, 484 Chinese students had. Criticism The book has been criticized for increasing the pressure many Chinese students already had to succeed in school, and for taking advantage of the widespread belief that admission into leading universities is necessary for success in life. Some critics have called the book \\"boastful.\\" A 2001 study by a group of educators claimed that the strategies described in the book would not work for everyone even though they had worked for Liu, and that many families following the book's advice would be disappointed. A 2004 book by Xiao Hui (ËêßÊÑö), entitled Raising Children Requires Great Wisdom: The Truth About \\"Harvard Girl Liu Yiting\\" (ÊïôËÇ≤Â≠©Â≠êÈúÄË¶ÅÂ§ßÊô∫ÊÖßÔºö‚ÄúÂìà‰ΩõÂ•≥Â≠©Âàò‰∫¶Â©∑‚ÄùÁúüÁõ∏), harshly criticizes Harvard Girl, calling the methods described in the book \\"false character building\\" (\\"‰º™Á¥†Ë¥®ÊïôËÇ≤\\") and claiming that Liu gained entrance into Harvard not because of her comprehensive or well-rounded education, Êñ∞Êµ™ÊïôËÇ≤ (Xinlang Teaching). but by exploiting loopholes and defects in Harvard's admissions policy for Chinese students or by taking advantage of guanxi, personal relationships and networks. Many successful Chinese students after Liu have tried to distance themselves from the so-called \\"Harvard Girl Phenomenon;\\" Harvard students Yin Zhongrui and Tang Meijie have both stated they do not want to be compared to \\"Harvard Girl.\\" Also accessible at International Herald Tribune. Yin's mother published a book, From Andover to Harvard, about how her son was accepted by Harvard, but Yin only allowed his full name to appear in the book's preface. Tang received at least six offers from publishers to have a book written about her, but declined them all. Nevertheless, many of China's top students are still compared to \\"Harvard Girl,\\" and admissions to top overseas universities often make big news in mainland China; for example, Cheng Wanxin (Á®ãÁê¨ËäØ) attracted media attention in Sichuan province when she was accepted to Harvard in April 2009.

Fort Wright was a Civil War fortification and the first military training facility of the Confederate Army in Tennessee. History On January 20, 1861 the Memphis Appeal published a pro-secessionist proposal to build a fort at Randolph to defend Memphis from invaders. In a communiqu√© sent to LeRoy P. Walker, the first Confederate States Secretary of War, Brigadier General Gideon J. Pillow endorsed Randolph on April 26, 1861 as \\"the most eligible situation for a battery to protect Memphis\\". Within a few days, in late April of that same year, Tennessee Governor Isham G. Harris ordered Lieutenant Colonel Marcus Joseph Wright to establish a camp at Randolph and complete the fortification. About 5,000 troops from Tennessee, Arkansas and the Confederate Army were stationed at the location to accomplish the task. It took four months to fortify the bluff at Randolph with earthen defenses and artillery batteries in order to protect the fort from land and naval attacks. By June 1861, the construction of the fortification was not yet completely finished. However, 50 cannons were reported to be ready at Fort Wright by that time, \\"mostly thirty-two pounders; the rest larger, 42s and 64s. Thirty-two of them are mounted\\". The Memphis Bulletin published a status report of Fort Wright after a visit at the fortification on June 22, 1861. By that time, the \\"earthen breastworks have been sodded with grass\\" and were reported \\"twenty to thirty feet in thickness\\" (6‚Äì10 m). Only one \\"narrow defile on the landward side\\" was reported by the Bulletin which was \\"defended by heavy guns\\" and \\"crossed by an earthen wall thirty to forty feet in thickness\\" (10‚Äì12 m). A \\"crescent shaped wall\\" to the east of the fortification provided a defense from land attacks. Fort Randolph, a second Confederate stronghold in the area, was constructed only months after Fort Wright, in Fall 1861. Ironclad battle on the Mississippi River near Fort Wright, May 10th, 1862. Currier & Ives lithograph Nathan Bedford Forrest (1821-77) and Alexander P. Stewart (1821-1908) trained at Fort Wright. Stewart was promoted to the rank of Major in the \\"Tennessee Militia\\" by Governor Harris and was assigned \\"command of the heavy artillery and water batteries (...) at Fort Wright\\" shortly after his own training there was completed. Stewart \\"organized and trained 20 batteries of Tennessee artillery\\" at Fort Wright at Randolph. Both Forrest and Stewart would later become important figures in the rank of Lieutenant General in the Confederate Army during the Civil War. Other future leaders in the Army of Tennessee and Forrest's cavalry received training at Fort Wright. Fort Wright was Tennessee's first military training camp in which soldiers could gain experience in the construction of fortifications and the setup of artillery batteries to counter naval attacks. They could undertake defense drills and acquire general military skills and discipline. Soldiers who were trained at Fort Wright fought in battles on different battlefields later in the war, the Battle of Shiloh, the Battle of Belmont, the Battle of Murfreesboro, the Battle of Chickamauga, the Battle of Franklin and the Battle of Bentonville. The Confederate stronghold at Fort Wright was the forwardmost defensive position on the Mississippi River until July 1861, it was abandoned by the Confederate infantry by 1862 but sporadically occupied by other southern forces during the Civil War.

Fort Randolph was located on the second Chickasaw Bluff at Randolph, Tipton County, Tennessee. History By June 1861, the first Confederate fortification at Randolph, Fort Wright, was close to completion. Fort Randolph, the second Confederate stronghold in the area, was constructed only months after Fort Wright, in Fall 1861. The fortification was situated on the Mississippi River bluffs, about southwest of Fort Wright. In a dispatch published by The New York Times in March 1862, Fort Randolph is described as a \\"rough and incomplete earthwork (...) built upon the Second Chickasaw Bluffs [sic], more than 100 feet above the river\\". The position of the fortification allowed a view of the Mississippi River for , both upstream and downstream. Boats approaching the fort on the river could be detected early from this strong position. Confederate troops at the garrison could prepare for naval attacks on the fort and Union Army supply boats passing on the Mississippi River could be attacked from the elevated position of Fort Randolph without much risk of immediate retaliation. The town of Columbus, Kentucky, located ca. north of Randolph on the Mississippi River, was reported robbed and burnt down by Confederate forces in March 1862. \\"Everything was destroyed that could not be carried away.\\" The rebels fled downstream to hide out at Fort Randolph in order to evade capture by Union troops. In October 1864, Lieutenant Colonel Jesse A. Forrest, one of General Nathan Bedford Forrest's five brothers, was in command of a company of the 16th Tennessee Cavalry Regiment at Fort Randolph. Confederate units that had suffered considerable loss or which had been fragmented in the course of the Civil War were aggregated and re- organized in the 16th Tennessee Cavalry Regiment. On October 27, Forrest's men attack the Steamboat Belle of St. Louis, Missouri from Fort Randolph. The Belle was on her way upstream from Memphis loaded with cotton bales, heading north to St. Louis. After the boat had landed at Randolph to pick up more payload, she was attacked by Confederate rebels. In the attack, one Union Army Major was killed on the vessel; 26 of the crew, who had gone ashore for freight, were captured by Confederate guerrillas when the captain had the steamboat push back out into the river in order to escape and save the boat from capture or destruction. The rebel forces suffered two casualties during the attack. In 2008, Fort Randolph is no longer in existence. Location *Fort Randolph (historical) was at coordinates .

Built in 1290, it is famous as the place where famed Confucian scholar and statesman Jeong Mong-ju was assassinated, allegedly on the orders of the Yi Bang-won, son of the first king of the Joseon Dynasty, Yi Seong-gye. The bridge was closed to all traffic in 1780 and has since been a national monument. It is 8.35m long and 3.36m wide. It was originally named the Sonji Bridge, but was renamed Sonjuk Bridge after the assassination of Mong-ju because bamboo grew where he was killed (juk being the Korean word for bamboo). Assassination of Jeong Mongju A famously loyal advisor to the king of Goryeo, Jeong was a staunch political opponent of Yi Seonggye. On his way home after a party held for him by the future king, he was ambushed by five men on the bridge and brutally murdered with an iron hammer. Later canonized as a Korean sage, and revered even by Joseon monarchs, Jeong's death came to symbolize unwavering loyalty. A brown spot on one of the stones is said to be Jong's bloodstain, and to become red when it rains. A famous poem of his records his final thoughts: Even if I may die, die a hundred times, Even if my skeleton may become dust and dirt, And whether my spirit may be there or not, My single-hearted loyalty to my lord will not change. Pyochung Pavilion Built during the Joseon dynasty, this small wooden structure houses two enormous stone stele mounted on the backs of lion-turtles, one erected in 1740 by King Yeongjo and the other by King Gojong in 1872. Both commemorate Jeong Mongju's assassination, and praise his loyalty to the Goryeo dynasty.

Early life and education He was born in Jefferson County, Virginia‚Äînow West Virginia‚Äîon his father's farm, Walnut Grove. He attended the University of Virginia to study law but upon the death of his father in 1855 he left his studies to take up farming. Civil War At the start of the war he joined Bott's Grays, Company G, in the 2nd Virginia Infantry. He received a wound in the lungs which left him incapable of active service. Inspired by John Hunt Morgan, he conceived a plan to launch privateers on the Great Lakes. He presented his plan to Confederate authorities, who were interested but declined to act since it might endanger relations with neutral Britain. However, Beall was commissioned as acting master in the Confederate States Navy, though not given a command. He then proceeded on his own as a privateer, active in the areas of the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay.Headley, John W., Confederate Operations in Canada and New York, p. 243. He assembled a crew of 18 men and commanded two boats, The Raven and The Swan. His second in command was a 22-year-old Scotsman named Bennet G. Burley. Beall was captured by Union forces in November 1863 and was jailed at Fort McHenry, in Baltimore, until he was exchanged on May 5, 1864. The Philo Parsons Upon his release he returned to the north shore of Lake Erie to Canada West, part of the Province of Canada, in order to implement a plan to free Confederate prisoners on Johnson's Island. On September 18, 1864, a small group of volunteers embarked from Sandwich and Amherstburg, Canada West, and, with Beall, captured the ship Philo Parsons off Kelleys Island, and then the Island Queen, which was scuttled. The plan included capturing the U.S. gunboat Michigan. However, at this point the crew refused to proceed further without outside assistance. Beall reluctantly agreed, and together they sailed back to Sandwich (the former name of and now a neighborhood of Windsor, Ontario), where they scuttled the Philo Parsons and separated, all escaping arrest except for Burley, whose extradition was demanded by U.S. authorities.Headley, p. 251 Beall then decided to free some captured Confederate officers by derailing a passenger train, but he and a companion, George S. Anderson, were arrested in Niagara, New York, on December 16, 1864. They were imprisoned at Fort Lafayette, New York. Anderson agreed to testify against Beall in return for leniency. General John Adams Dix ordered a military commission for Beall's trial, which began on January 17, 1865. He was represented by James T. Brady. The arrest of Beall had not been published in any newspaper, and Confederate authorities were unaware of his status. On February 8 the commission found him guilty on all charges and sentenced him to death. Beall was then transported to and held at Fort Columbus on Governors Island in New York Harbor to await his execution. The story of Beall's arrest and trial then appeared in the newspapers, and efforts were made to save him. Appeals were made to President Abraham Lincoln by many prominent people, including six U.S. Senators and 91 members of Congress,Headley, p. 361 but Lincoln refused to intervene, not wanting to undermine Dix's authority. Beall was executed on February 24, 1865. There is a legend discussed by Lloyd Lewis that Lincoln was approached by John Wilkes Booth, who was a friend of Beall's, to save his life, and that the President agreed to do so, but changed his mind (the legend goes) when he was approached by his friend and Secretary of State William H. Seward, who insisted that Beall's activities had been dangerous to the citizens of New York (Seward's home state). Supposedly a furious Booth determined to kill Lincoln and Seward for this betrayal after Beall was executed.

Spying According to The New York Times, following Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, Jarrah was jailed and then recruited as an intelligence asset by Israeli officers in 1983. As part of his work he photographed Hezbollah supply routes, and traveled throughout Lebanon and Syria. He communicated his information by satellite phone, and even made several trips to Israel on an Israeli passport obtained in Belgium or Italy. Paid by means of dead drops, Jarrah is reported to have received in excess of US$300,000 over the years. Personal life Ali al-Jarrah lived in Maraj, Lebanon with his wife Maryam Shmouri al-Jarrah and their five children. A brother, Yusuf, has also been accused of helping him spy for Israel. Jarrah is also said to have secretly married a second wife living in Masnaa, which made it easier for him to move between the Lebanon-Syria border. Ali al-Jarrah is a first cousin of Ziad Jarrah, who is known as one of the terrorists that hijacked United Airlines Flight 93 as part of the September 11 attacks.

The system consists of the gun (2-4 cartridges, laser target pointer, electronic ignition capsule), and various ammunition types. Osa was developed in the 1990s by engineer- constructor and weapon designer G.A. Bideev (–ì.–ê. –ë–∏–¥–µ–µ–≤).–ì. –ë–∏–¥–µ–µ–≤. –ö–æ–º–ø–ª–µ–∫—Å –û–°–ê - –æ—Ä—É–∂–∏–µ —Å–∞–º–æ–æ–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—ã XXI –≤–µ–∫–∞ // \\"–†—É–∂—å—ë\\", ‚Ññ 1, 2000. It was designed and is manufactured by the state-owned organizations Federal Center for Research and Manufacturing and The Institute for Science and Research in the Applied Chemistry. The pistol is available in the civilian market. Design details The PB-4 is a four-barreled break-action gun. It has two horizontal \\"8\\"-shaped chambers in its aluminum chamber block, each housing two rounds. There is no need for a separate chamber for each round, because the gas pressure is contained by the cartridges' thick cylindrical case (the external case diameter is 18mm, while the bullet caliber is 15.3mm). This design aims to prevent the gun from operating properly if the round is unlawfully modified to increase its power. The cartridge case also performs the function of the barrel, with the bullet positioned deep inside and accelerating within the case. The front end of the case is level with the front end of the chamber block when in firing position. There is a four-fingered extractor in the central channel of the chamber block; the cartridge cases are rimless and have an extractor groove. The extractor keeps cases from falling forward outside of the chamber block. When the action is opened, cases are extracted backwards for manual reloading. The trigger and trigger guard are fixed to lower side of the chamber block. The chamber block is locked to the handle block, which contains the locking surface, firing button (pushed by the trigger when the chamber block is locked), pistol grip, battery and electronics. The cartridge primers are ignited electrically, so there are four circular contact plates on the locking surface (contacting the case bottom) and four contact pins in the center of each plate (contacting the primer). On the trigger pull an impulse is generated. The electronic firing mechanism is able to send firing impulses in sequence to the chambers from 1 to 4 and to skip chambers with malfunctioning rounds to avoid misfires. The weapon is only capable of firing one round at a time. There are different models of PB-4; in some, the firing mechanism is fed by a battery, on others by a piezoelectric igniter similar to those used by kitchen gas lighters. There is a simple sight assembly atop the chamber block ‚Äì a semi-cylindrical groove along it, and a white forward post at the front of the groove. Some variants of PB-4 have a built-in laser sight with a laser window in the center of the \\"locking surface\\", and the beam following the central extractor channel of the chamber block. The laser switch on the left side of the handle block is operated by the thumb, and the laser is fed by a battery inside the pistol grip. There are no safety switches ‚Äì the locked and loaded weapon is always ready to fire (provided the battery is not discharged, for the models which use a battery). The Osa Handgun M09 has been marketed in The Americas via Defenzia, LLC in the United States and Defenzia, LTDA in Brazil. Defenzia plans on assembling and manufacturing the pistols in Brazil and subsequently in the United States beginning in 2016 under the Brand Defenzia. Osa and Defenzia have entered into this joint agreement in 2014. In 2016 both companies plan on launching the civilian \\"M11\\" version of the weapon in the USA. This new less-lethal weapon for the civilian market will come in 50 Caliber and have the same capabilities as the law-enforcement weapon, and awaits BATF approval.For more information visit

Made in 1915, chambered in 9x23 Steyr with holster and ammunition The Steyr M1912, also known as the Steyr-Hahn, is a semi-automatic pistol developed in 1911 by the Austrian firm Steyr Mannlicher, based on the mechanism of the Roth‚ÄìSteyr M1907. It was developed for the Austro-Hungarian Army and adopted in 1912. It was able to endure the adverse conditions of trench warfare during World War I. The M1912 was originally chambered for the 9mm Steyr round. History The M1912 was developed as the Model 1911, a military pistol, but it was not accepted into service until 1914 as the M12. It was originally issued to the Austrian Landwehr while common army units were issued Roth‚ÄìSteyr M1907 handguns and Rast & Gasser M1898 revolvers. Orders were also placed by Chile and Romania. During World War I, Austria-Hungary experienced shortages of handguns and production of the M1912 was increased. Germany also placed an order for 10,000 Model 12s. After World War I, a commercial model the Steyr M1911 was produced and was quite popular with army officers, but Steyr had to rely on foreign exports to sustain production. After Germany annexed Austria in 1938, the Wehrmacht ordered 60,000 M1912 pistols rechambered to 9mm Parabellum which remained in service until the end of World War II. Design details The Steyr M1912 handgun is operated by a system of short recoil, the barrel unlocking from the slide by rotation. As the pistol is being fired and the recoil of the pistol is in motion, a lug and groove system around the barrel rotate the barrel 20¬∞ until a lug hits a stop wedge and holds the barrel while the slide is free to continue its rearward travel, the extractor claw withdrawing the spent casing against the breech face of the slide until the casing strikes the ejector and departs the weapon via the ejection and loading port.Hogg, Ian V.; John Weeks (2000). Military small arms of the 20th century (7th ed.). Iola, Wisconsin: Krause Publications,. p. 99. . Shortly after ejection the slide's rearward travel is arrested by the compressed recoil spring and the abutment of mated surfaces of the slide and frame. The recoil spring is now free to return its stored energy to the cycle of the weapon by beginning to return the slide forward. As the return spring returns the slide forward, the breech face strips a round from the magazine into the chamber and the locking system engages the barrel and locks it with the slide in the battery position. A safety lever on the left side of the frame can be engaged by turning it into a notch on the slide to immobilize the slide. A disconnector system will also prevent the weapon from firing until the whole action is fully closed. Although the magazine is situated in the grip, it is integral with the weapon and is loaded from above using eight-round stripper clips. To load, the slide is pulled back to expose the action, the clip is inserted along the guides and the rounds pushed into the magazine. The metal strip is then discarded. As with the majority of pistols with integral magazines, a lever can be used to disengage the magazine catch in order to eject the magazine load. Variants Steyr Repetierpistole M1912/P16. This variant with an extended magazine was often fitted with a stock to control recoil. 9mm P12(√ñ) After Germany annexed Austria in 1938, the Wehrmacht ordered 60,000 M1912 pistols rechambered in 9mm Parabellum which remained in service until the end of World War II. In German service, its official designation was 9mm P12(√ñ) (√ñ for √ñsterreichisch, \\"Austrian\\"). Pistols in Wehrmacht service were distinguished by the Wehrmachtadler (\\"Wehrmacht Eagle\\") emblem above the trigger and most noticeably a \\"P-08\\" or \\"08\\" stamp on the left side of the slide, \\"to show that they chambered German 1908-type ammunition.\\" Doppelpistole M.12 A dual pistol mount and stock was also developed that converted two M1912/P16s into a (double pistol) submachine gun such weapon known as the Doppelpistole M1912.http://www.ign.com/boards/threads/no-gun-will-ever-say-you-as-much-as- the-doppelpistole-m-12.454852667/ pictures of Doppelpistole M1912 However, only a handful were made before it was abandoned. Repetierpistole M1912/P16 During World War I, a machine pistol version of the Steyr M1912 called the Repetierpistole M1912/P16 was produced. It used a 16 round fixed magazine loaded via 8 round stripper clips, a detachable shoulder stock and a rather large exposed semi-auto/full-auto selector on the right side of the frame above the trigger (down = semi & up = full). Rate of fire was about 800 to 1000 rounds per minute. It weighed about 2.6 pounds. Introduced in 1916, it is considered the world's first machine pistol. Only 960 M1912/P16 were made.This variant saw usage by SS police during the occupation of Austria.

Arnold (Companies F and I of the Second United States Dragoons) at the site of Jose Maria Village, an Anadaca camp on the western edge of present-day Hill County, Texas. It remained in service until 1853, when settlements had moved further west. It was named after Col. William M. Graham, who died at the Battle of Molina del Rey. A line of seven army posts was established in 1848-49 after the Mexican War to protect the settlers of West Texas and included Fort Worth, Fort Graham, Fort Gates, Fort Croghan, Fort Martin Scott, Fort Lincoln, and Fort Duncan. Reconstruction In 1936, the Texas Centennial Commission granted Hill County $6,700 to purchase the land upon which the Fort stood and reconstruct one of the buildings. US Army Corps of Engineers and Lake Whitney In 1953, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers took the fort site as part of the Lake Whitney project. Dr. S. Alan Skinner published, in 1974, An Evaluation of the Archaeological Resources at Lake Whitney, Texas, Southern Methodist University contributions in anthropology No. 14. The Corps, in accordance with the 1936 dedication, operated a park on the site until 1982 at which time Hill County, Texas was forced to enter into a lease for the property or lose this culturally significant resource. Preservation In 1983, a group of local citizens led by Mrs. Selma Hill raised $15,000 to move the building, determined that the fort be preserved. At this time, the building was only three years from being eligible for the National Register on its own merits, but the citizens were never informed of this. Had it achieved National Register status, the Corps would have been forced to take preservative action. The citizens of the county continued to maintain the site until 2002, when the corps came before the county demanding that a minimum of $60,000 be spent for the revitalization of the area. Hill County did not have sufficient funds, thus it relinquished the lease. Fort Graham Preservation Society The Fort Graham Preservation Society, Inc. is a nonprofit corporation established to ensure that the memory of Fort Graham is not lost. It is currently working with federal and county agencies to preserve and revitalize Fort Graham Park and archeological site.

The Quito trolleybus system is a bus rapid transit line located in Quito, Ecuador, which opened in 1995 and by 2002 was carrying approximately 220,000 passengers per day.Webb, Mary (ed.) (2003), Jane's Urban Transport Systems 2003-2004, (UK): Jane's Information Group. . It is managed by an agency of the municipality known as Empresa Metropolitana de Servicios y Administraci√≥n del Transporte (EMSAT) and is operated by Compa√±√≠a Troleb√∫s Quito, S.A. The service is named (informally) El Trole, Spanish for \\"The Trolley\\", meaning trolleybus; this name is shown on signage at stops, and is used in publicity and marketing. Before being a subsystem of a larger bus rapid transit system of Quito known as MetrobusQ, El Trole was itself a whole system. Its formal name is Corredor Trole or; simply Trole, currently. The route BRT lanes with underpass crossings The trolleybus system is composed of a single 18.7-km line that runs, with a few exceptions, through the part of Ecuador Highway 35 (E 35) that is within Quito. The three segments of E 35 inside Quito are Avenida Diez de Agosto (northern Quito), Calle Guayaquil (center of Quito) and Avenida Pedro Vicente Maldonado (south of Quito). Seven different passenger services, or circuitos, are operated along the trolleybus route, differing in their terminus locations but overlapping one another. The initial 11.2-km line opened in three stages between 17 December 1995 and 21 April 1996,Morrison, Allen. \\"Railless Rapid Transit in Ecuador\\".

(UK). . and connected the La \\"Y\\" district, in northern Quito and near Mariscal Sucre International Airport, to the El Recreo shopping mall (Centro Comercial El Recreo), in southern Quito, via the city center. On 30 April 2000, the line was extended south by 5 km to Mor√°n Valverde. On 19 December 2008, it was extended farther south and east, by 2.5 km, to Quitumbe,\\"El trole va desde hoy a Quitumbe\\". El Comercio, 19 December 2008. where it terminates at a large new intercity-bus station.Trolleybus Magazine (UK) No. 284, March‚ÄìApril 2009, p. 37. This latest extension brought the length of the full line to 18.7 km. Between the Mach√°ngara River and the Villa Flora stop, the line originally followed separate streets in opposite directions: southbound along Avenida Cardenal Carlos Maria de la Torre and northbound along Avenida Maldonado, but the section along Cardenal de la Torre was closed in 2003, and the route thereafter has followed Avenida Maldonado in both directions along that section. Operation A trolleybus stopped at one of the high-platform stations typical of the line. Detail view of the ends of the trolley poles and trolley-heads on the catenary or overhead lines Service is provided by a fleet of 113 articulated trolleybuses, built by Hispano Carrocera and Mercedes-Benz, with electrical equipment by Kiepe Elektrik and AEG/Adtranz. For the first phase, 54 vehicles were delivered in 1995-96. Another 59 very similar vehicles were delivered in 1999-2000 for the system's expansion. The line operates in dedicated trolleybus-only lanes over almost its entire length, and the trolleybuses are given traffic-signal priority at most intersections. Large terminals, called Estaciones, are located at the line's two original termini, Estaci√≥n Norte La \\"Y\\" and Estaci√≥n Sur El Recreo, and also at Mor√°n Valverde and Quitumbe. In between these large terminals are many smaller stations, known as paradas (or \\"stops\\"), spaced about 550 meters apart, on average. In addition to the traffic separation and signal priority, other features of El Trole intended to facilitate fast service--and making the operation similar to many light rail lines--include the arrangements at stops: * All fare collection takes place off of the vehicles, and the boarding area is a \\"paid area\\", to which passengers are given access (via turnstiles) only upon paying (to a ticket machine or agent) or showing a prepaid fare instrument such as a monthly pass. This allows boarding and alighting to take place simultaneously at all three doorways of each vehicle. * All stops have high-level boarding platforms that are vertically aligned with the floors of the trolleybuses, allowing level, step-free boarding. The vehicles are equipped at each doorway with bridge plates that fold down at stops, to bridge the gap between the vehicle and the platform. The scheduled service frequency is very high at most times, over most of the line, with the headways/intervals being as short as 60 seconds during peak periods. All four of the major Estaciones (transfer terminals) are served by several suburban bus routes, \\"feeding\\" the trolleybus line, and transfers made there are free. The original operator of El Trole was a department of the municipal government known as Unidad Operadora del Sistema Troleb√∫s (UOST), but around March 2008 operation was transferred to Compa√±√≠a Troleb√∫s Quito S.A., a newly formed private company that is believed to be still municipally owned.

Post-war New Zealand has become a highly secular country, meaning that religion does not play a major role in the lives of many of the population. Although New Zealand has no established religion, Christianity had been the majority religious affiliation since European settlement in the 19th century. Demographics The increase of the proportion of the population recorded as having 'no religion' over the last six censuses. 2013 Census graph of people stating no religion by sex and age. Irreligion is highest among males and younger generations. Statistics New Zealand gathers information on religious affiliation in the five-yearly census. Completing a census form is compulsory by law for every person in New Zealand on census night but respondents are able to object to answering the question of religious affiliation, and around 6% do object.Table 28, 2006 Census Data ‚Äì QuickStats About Culture and Identity ‚Äì Tables . The trend shows an increasing proportion of residents in New Zealand declaring no religious affiliation. In the 1991 census, 20.2% were in this category. The proportion more than doubled in two decades, reaching 41.9% in the 2013 census, and increased again to 48.2% in the 2018 census, when for the first time a plurality of New Zealanders claimed \\"no religion\\". There is significant debate among sociologists about the interpretation of this trend in census data. The increase in those indicating 'no religion' is often cited in support of the secularisation thesis. An alternative theory is that the data indicates a decline in institutional religious affiliation rather than simply a decrease in spiritual belief. A 1985 survey showed that around one-quarter of those answering 'no religion' may believe in a god and that, conversely, between 7 percent and 36 percent of Christians (depending on their denomination) did not believe in the existence of deities. The International Social Survey Programme was conducted in New Zealand by Massey University in 2008. It received mail- responses from around one thousand New Zealanders above the age of 18, surveying issues of religious belief and practice. The results of this survey indicated that 72% of the population believe in God or a higher power, 15% are agnostic, and 13% are atheist (with a 3% margin of error). According to a report by the American Physical Society, religion may die out in New Zealand and eight other Western world countries. As of the 2018 census, those who did not affiliate with a religion outnumbered those with a religion for the first time. Irreligion in society The Humanist Society of New Zealand and the New Zealand Association of Rationalists and Humanists promote a secular view of life without reference to supernatural agencies as one of their aims. A campaign to create advertisements similar to the Atheist Bus Campaign in the United Kingdom began a fund-raising drive on 10 December 2009, and reached its initial target of $10,000 in donations within 48 hours, making it one of the most successful atheist campaigns of all time.NZ Atheist Bus Campaign Blog $10,000 and growing fast  MƒÅori and other ethnic groups  Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand notes, in 2013 \\"47% of people who identified themselves as Europeans or New Zealanders said they had no religion ‚Äì as did 46% of MƒÅori and 30% of Asians.

The MKMO - M = Maschinen, K = Karabiner M = Milit√§r, O = Oben (Top ejection) - was designed for the military and to increase firepower it had a larger-capacity magazine as well as a longer barrel. Only 1,228 of these guns were produced. It saw limited adoption by Swiss police departments and the Swiss Guard at the Vatican. Finland purchased approximately 282 of the original MKMO variant, which were used by the home guard, supply units and coastal defense forces in the Continuation War.  Design  The SIG MKMO used a hesitation-locked operating system which kept the cartridge within the chamber long enough for the pressure within the barrel to decrease to a safe level. This system was adapted by Gotthard End based on a John Pedersen design first used in the Remington Model 51 pistol. It was also the first personal weapon to have a folding magazine well so that the magazine and mag well could be pivoted horizontally and stored within the wooden fore-stock. This made transportation during non-combat movement easy and much less difficult compared to traditional magazine wells. A simple catch system would release the magazine allowing for quick deployment. The locked-breech blowback system mirrored that of John Pedersen's Remington Model 51 only with a locking recess above rather than below the bolt. When the firearm is in battery, the breech block rests slightly forward of the locking shoulder in the frame. When the cartridge is fired, the breech block and bolt carrier move together a short distance rearward powered by the energy of the cartridge as in a standard blowback system. When the breech block contacts the locking shoulder, it stops, locking the breech. The bolt carrier continues rearward with the momentum it acquired in the initial phase. This delay allows chamber pressure to drop to safe levels while the breech is locked and the cartridge slightly extracted. Once the bullet leaves the barrel and pressure drops, the continuing motion of the bolt carrier cams the breech block from its locking recess, continuing the operating cycle. There was no fire selector switch for single or automatic fire. This was gauged by the force of pull on the trigger: a short pull was for single shot, and a long pull was for automatic fire. This was also one of the first sub-machine guns that had an integral dust cover on the magazine housing. The sights for both the MKMO and MKPO were both fully manually adjustable but could be calibrated from 100m to an optimistic 1000m. This led to much confusion with accuracy often found wanting in young soldiers who could not operate the sights properly.  Variants  There were 2 variants of the MKMO. There was the shortened barreled (300 mm) MKPO ( P for Police), which still used the two-part hesitation-locked action. This was designed for the police market. In 1937, SIG introduced the simplified MKMS and MKPS (S for Seitlich, side ejection of the empty shell). These versions did away with the Pedersen hesitation lock and operated on the straight blowback system firing from an open bolt. The MKMO, MKPO, MKMS and MKPS submachine guns were still priced high and sales were slow. Production was stopped in 1941. 60 of the MKPS, Serial No. 3321 - 3380, chambered for 7.65mm Parabellum were shipped to the Swiss army in 1940.

History Development of a new submachine gun chambered for the 9√ó21mm Gyurza cartridge (also used by the SR-1 \\"Vektor\\" pistol) was launched in the mid-1990s on the request of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB). A weapon was presented in 1999, developed by TsNIITochMash in Klimovsk, which received the designation of SR-2 (, English: Special Development 2) and nicknamed \\"Veresk\\" (\\"Heather\\"). \\"Veresk\\" and its round were created as a compact weapon capable of engaging enemies wearing Russian class-II body armor (able to stop ordinary pistol bullets, such as 9√ó19mm Parabellum and 7.62√ó25mm Tokarev), and soft-skinned vehicles, at distances up to 200 metres. Features The SR-2 \\"Veresk\\" differs from most submachine guns by its gas-operated action with rotating bolt, typically used in assault rifles (normally SMGs utilise different blowback principles). This design is partially borrowed from the SR-3 \\"Vikhr\\" compact assault rifle. Externally the \\"Veresk\\" is similar to the Uzi; 20- or 30-round magazines are inserted into the pistol grip. There are two AK-style control levers on both sides of the receiver: the right one is the safety switch, the left is a fire- mode selector. The cocking handle is on the right side and is fixed to the bolt carrier, so it moves during firing. There is a mount for a \\"red dot\\" sight on top of the receiver (unlike the AK-style side rail). The weapon has an upwards-folding metal stock. An SR-2M modified version also has a forward pistol grip under the handguard, with a protrusion to protect the shooter's hand from muzzle blast and accidents (similar to the grip on the MP5K). The SR-2M stock can be fully folded even with \\"red dot\\" sight installed.

It was a blowback- operated, two trigger weapon which fired a 7.62mm round originally intended as a pistol round. Before it could go into production other manufacturers produced their own submachine guns. In competitive trials a weapon designed by Degtyarev proved superior and further development of the Tokarev was halted. Origin Owing to supply problems, in 1924 the Soviet leadership decided to abandon all weapons using foreign ammunition. As a consequence, production of the Fedorov Avtomat was halted in 1925 and was withdrawn from service by 1928. In 1925 the Soviet Army commission for weapons decided that submachineguns should be introduced into army service, initially as offensive weapons for low-ranking officers. Consequently, a contest was started the following year for such weapons. Tokarev, who was familiar with Fedorov's work, decided to take up the challenge of producing a suitable substitute weapon that would work with permissible ammunition. This resulted in the first Soviet-made submachine gun using the 7.62√ó38mmR revolver round, because at the time there was no Soviet automatic pistol round accepted for army use. Description The 1927 Tokarev is a blowback-operated weapon, capable of selective fire, which is achieved by using two triggers. The rear trigger fired a single shot, while the front trigger was for fully automatic fire. The butt of the gun has a storage cavity for an additional magazine. The guns is sighted for 100 or 200 meters, adjustable by flipping up one of the two peephole sights on the receiver. A carbine prototype was also produced; it has a single trigger, slightly longer barrel, and adjustable sights up to 800 meters, despite using the same weak cartridge; an exemplar of both variants can now be found at the Military Historical Museum of Artillery, Engineers and Signal Corps in Saint Petersburg. Prototype trials Only a handful of these submachine guns had been ordered for trial purposes, when in July 1928 the Soviet Army leadership decided that a single new automatic cartridge should be developed for both automatic pistols and submachine guns, to be obtained by modifying the 7.63√ó25mm Mauser round down to the Soviet machinery standard of 7.62 mm. Tokarev had to adapt his design to this new ammunition. By then the competition had been joined by designs from Degtyarev and Korovin, who designed their weapons directly for the new round. Trials were conducted in July 1930, pitted Tokarev models chambered for both rounds against these other two domestic competitors. The Army commission was rather dissatisfied with all guns presented at this trial. Eventually, in Feb 1931, the army ordered 500 Tokarevs chambered in the revolver round, to be sent to the troops for more extensive trials. The feedback received from the troops was apparently negative. The number of Tokarev submachineguns (chambered in the Nagant round) actually produced and delivered remains uncertain.–ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª –î–µ–≥—Ç–∏–∞—Ç—ë–≤, \\"–ü–µ—Ä–≤—ã–π –æ—Ç–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π. –ü–∏—Å—Ç–æ–ª–µ—Ç-–ø—É–ª–µ–º—ë—Ç –¢–æ–∫–∞—Ä–µ–≤–∞ –ø–æ–¥ —Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—å–≤–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω\\" // –ö–∞–ª–∞—à–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤. –û—Ä—É–∂–∏–µ, –±–æ–µ–ø—Ä–∏–ø–∞—Å—ã, —Å–Ω–∞—Ä—è–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ (Kalashnikov magazine) 2009/1, pp. 70‚Äì73 Between 1932 and 1933 yet more trials were held, with 14 different submachine gun samples from Tokarev, Degtyarev, Korovin, Prilutsk and Kolesnikov. The army commission eliminated the guns of Korovin, Prilutsk and Kolesnikov as unsatisfactory due to their unreliable cycling. Ultimately it was a showdown between Degtyarev and Tokarev's gun, but except for weight, Degtyarev's model proved superior in all other departments: accuracy, muzzle velocity, a lower rate of fire (as desired by the army), ease of handling and reliability. Degtyarev's model was eventually commissioned in 1935 as the PPD-34.

They are among the earliest settlers in the Malay peninsula. Kedahan Malays comprised at least 15% of the total Malaysian Malay population.  History  A Kedahan Malay man and his son standing in front of a decorated vehicle in Alor Setar, Kedah, 1937. According to history, Kedah was very popular among Arabian traders. Thus, this has led to interracial marriages between Arabs and Malays. Due to Arabic influences in the Kedahan Malay language, some Kedahan Malay are of Arab descent. However some of the Kedahan Malays that resided on the island-state of Penang might have Indian and/or Chinese blood and some who lived in Thailand might have Thai blood.  Kedah Valley  Kedah Valley is an area where the majority inhabitants are Kedahan Malays. The valley covered the Satun province of Thailand and the three northern states of Malaysia (Perlis, Kedah, Pulau Pinang) with at least an area of 25,908 km square.  Demonym  Nowadays, most Kedahan Malays known themselves as Orang Utara or \\"People Of The Northern Region\\" instead of Kedahan Malay since that they resided the northern part of Peninsular Malaysia. So are their language, which is called Pelat Utara or Northern Dialect.  Language  An old traditional Kedahan Malay style house. The Kedahan Malays have their own unique variety of Malay known as Kedah Malay or Pelat Utagha (northern dialect) as known by its native speakers. It is related to other varieties of Malay spoken in the peninsular but has its own unique pronunciation and also vocabulary. Kedahan Malay language can be divided into several sub-dialects, namely Kedah Persisiran (standard) or Kedah Hulu, Kedah Utara, Perlis-Langkawi, Penang and some others (sub-dialects spoken in Satun and Southern Myanmar). For instance instead of using kamu to denote as 'you', hang (English pronunciation: hung) is used instead and cek for 'i/me' instead of aku in other Malay varieties in the peninsular. Besides proper Kedah Malay, another variety of Malay spoken is Baling Malay, which is distinct from Kedah Malay and more closely related to varieties of Malay spoken in Southern Thailand and East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Kedah Malay is considered distinct enough to have its own ISO code that is meo.  Customs and culture  Kedahan Malay woman in traditional attire, 1930. Kedahan Malay shares the same customs and traditions with other Malay in Peninsular Malaysia. The only thing that make them different is just their spoken dialect.

The Negotiations After the annexation of the Nicoya jurisdiction in 1824 by Costa Rica, Nicaragua reclaimed this territory on repeated occasions. Although Nicaragua claimed the land, arguments over the land still continued. In an attempt to mend these disputes over ownership many subsequent treaties were drawn up, including the treaty of Oreamuno-Buitrago (1838), Madriz-Zavala (1846), Molina-Ju√°rez (1848), Molina-Marcoleta (1854), Ca√±as-Ju√°rez (1857), Ca√±as-Mart√≠nez treaty (1857) and the Webster-Crampton (1852) treaty. Despite all these actions, none of the treaties were agreed upon by both parties. Eventually a Webster- Crampton treaty was approved. In April 1858, Nicaragua sent M√°ximo Jerez Teller√≠a, the Minister of Plenipotentiary to San Jose to try to negotiate a new agreement. Costa Rica subsequently appointed General Jos√© Mar√≠a Ca√±as Escamilla to negotiate with Teler√≠a. The negotiations took place in the presence of F√©liz Belly, a French journalist who was interested in a contract to build a new canal. On April 15th the new treaty was approved narrowly by the Costa Rican Congress and was also approved by the Constituent Assembly of Nicaragua. Juan Rafael, the Costa Rican president traveled to the Nicaraguan city of Rivas where the treaty was exchanged with the Nicaraguan president, Tom√°s Mart√≠nez Guerrero. In the 1870s, Nicaragua began to object the validity of the treaty. In an attempt to resolve the differences, the following negotiations were held and signed in addition the previous treaty, Herrera- Zavala (1872), V√≠quez-Step (1886), and Zambrana-Alvarez (1883). The Castro- Navas (1884) talks were not settled. During 1886, more tensions rose between Costa Rica and Nicaragua but to the assistance of Guatalama, an arbitrary agreement was signed by the Licensed Ascension Esquivel Ibarra, of Costa Rica and Mr. Jos√© Antonio Rom√°n of Nicaragua. At the Esquivel- Rom√°n meeting, it was agreed that the validity of the Ca√±as-Jerez treaty was possibly invalid by the United States President. On March 22, 1888, president Grover Cleveland recognized the validity of the Ca√±as-Jerez treaty. Cleveland clarified many points of unclear interpretation within the treaty.Nicaragua‚Äôs Ortega threatens to ‚Äòreclaim‚Äô Costa Rican province Tico Times, 2013-08-14.Costa Rica says Ortega‚Äôs claim on Guanacaste 'severely damages' relations Tico Times, 2013-08-14.

Kennedy appointed two men to the Supreme Court of the United States: Byron White and Arthur Goldberg. Given the advanced age of Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter at the time of Kennedy's inauguration, speculation abounded over potential Kennedy nominations to the Supreme Court from the start of his presidency. Byron White nomination Associate Justice Charles Evans Whittaker retired from the Supreme Court (technically taking senior status) in March 1962 after just over five years on the court,Charles Evans Whittaker biography from the Federal Judicial Center. citing exhaustion from the workload. The Whittaker retirement gave Kennedy his first vacancy on the Supreme Court. Two names initially came up as potential nominees: Judge William H. Hastie of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and Harvard Law School Professor Paul A. Freund. United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy had recommended Hastie, who would have become the first African-American on the Supreme Court. Robert F. Kennedy said \\"it would mean so much overseas that we had a Negro on the Supreme Court.\\" However, Hastie was opposed by Chief Justice Earl Warren, who balked because \\"he's not a liberal and he'll be opposed to all measures we are interested in, and he would be completely unsatisfactory.\\" Associate Justice William O. Douglas also objected to Hastie as the nominee. In addition, President Kennedy's adviser, Ted Sorensen, opposed Hastie because Kennedy was in the process of considering another African-American, Robert C. Weaver, for a cabinet post (Weaver ultimately became the first United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, inviting the charge of reverse racism). Sorensen argued that \\"the first appointment should be one hailed by all for his judicial mien.\\" Sorensen recommended Freund as the nominee. However, President Kennedy objected to Freund as the nominee because of Freund's Harvard pedigree (having attended Harvard Law School and having been a professor at Harvard Law School at the time of the Whittaker vacancy), given that there already were a significant number of people connected to Harvard University in the Kennedy administration. Ultimately, Kennedy selected White, who was a longtime supporter of his and who had been serving as United States Deputy Attorney General. Kennedy formally nominated White to the Supreme Court on April 3, 1962. White was confirmed by the United States Senate just eight days later, on April 11, 1962, in a voice vote.Byron R. White biography from the Federal Judicial Center. Arthur Goldberg nomination After suffering a stroke, Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter retired (technically taking senior status) from the Supreme Court on August 28, 1962, at the age of 79.Felix Frankfurter biography from the Federal Judicial Center. There is not much evidence that Kennedy considered any other candidate other than Goldberg for the vacancy. It had been widely reported that Frankfurter's seat was considered a \\"Jewish seat\\" on the Supreme Court (prior to Frankfurter, it had been occupied by another Jewish Justice, Benjamin N. Cardozo), meaning that the president felt significant pressure to appoint a Jew to replace Frankfurter. Kennedy nominated Goldberg, who at that time was United States Secretary of Labor, on August 31, 1962. The United States Senate confirmed Goldberg in a voice vote on September 25, 1962.Arthur Goldberg biography from the Federal Judicial Center.

A more ideologically coherent party name Constitutional was founded by lawyers in order to take part in the 1948 Costa Rican Constituent Assembly election after the Costa Rican Civil War. The party was rumored to be led by the then outlaw Calderonistas who lost the war, but although most of its members were relatives of Calderonistas they never held offices during Calderon's party government and were allowed to participate, to the point that even the Electoral Court gave them an extension to end the conformation of the party thanks to then president Otilio Ulate intervention.

The formation is not caused by the mouthparts of the mites, because these mites do not have needle-like mouthparts as other hematophagous animals have been known to have, but have chelicerae, which only pierce the skin. The tube is formed by the digestive enzymes in the saliva, which are the same salivary secretions that break down cells and cause the surrounding tissue to harden. As the mite feeds longer, the saliva seeps further down, digesting more tissue and causing the stylosome to penetrate to lower layers of skin. Trombicula mite larva with stylostome Transmission of disease Normally, the bite mark causes local swelling or welts, but in more serious cases it causes dermatitis. The mite can be infected with a disease called scrub typhus in Asia and the Pacific and can transmit the disease by carrying saliva directly into the blood stream, but mites in North America have not been known to transmit Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia or any other disease.

It is just down the road from Eastern Michigan University and is a popular hangout for students and faculty. Linda French, who has owned the restaurant since 1980, named it after ‚Äúits unique location alongside the main railroad line from Detroit to Chicago.‚Äù The location has served as a restaurant, under different names, as far back as 1850. It has a large beer selection as well as liquor and wine and has won awards for its food. History Names Sidetrack Bar & Grill dining area Sidetrack Bar and Grill is the current name of the restaurant on the corner of River St. and Cross St. because of its location next to the railroad tracks. Before it was Sidetrack Bar and Grill it was known as Central Bar or ‚ÄúThe Central.‚Äù The name was from the New York Central Railroad being the owner of the rail line next to Central Bar. New York Central Railroad sold the line to Pennsylvania Railroad which changed the name of the rail line; the Central Bar did not change their name. Christo's Bar was the name previous to Central Bar because the Christo family was the owners and operators. Pictures of them can be found in the Sidetrack's menu today. From back in the nineteenth century until 1949, Max's was the moniker of the bar. Most of the patrons were said to be railroad workers not college students and faculty like they are today. Train Wreck Sidetrack Bar & Grill bar area Sidetrack's building has an atypical shape due to a train derailment that happened in 1929. On an early January morning, a freight train moving through Depot Town came off its track and crashed into the corner of what is now Sidetrack Bar and Grill. The owner of the building, who lived just above the section that was hit, was uninjured. As a result, she had most of her personal effects scattered out in the street. There were only a few people near the railroad crossing when it derailed including an 18-year-old female who was knocked unconscious and a man who was sitting in his car, but was able to get away unharmed. When the current owners went to build a patio on the spot, they found some of the debris had been piled up underneath, which made it more difficult to dig post holes. Post Prohibition When prohibition was repealed new laws stated that entrances to bar had to be at least five hundred feet from churches. This caused the entrance to the restaurant changed from the east side of the building to the north side in 1931.The church that was located within the five hundred foot limit, burned down before construction began on the back patio. COVID-19 Outbreak In July of 2020, the restaurant reopened after a three day closure due to an employee testing positive for COVID-19. This employee was not sent home from work and potentially exposed hundreds to the virus. Allegations of Abuse to Staff On July 22, 2020, a staff member came forward in a now-viral post on social media with allegations of being fired over quarantining. His story was corroborated and met with dozens of ex employees coming forward with their own stories of emotional, mental, and physical abuse. Multiple accusations of employee abuse has been documented since then, and a lawsuit was filed on the matter. Awards GQ magazine named Sidetrack's ‚ÄúOur Famous Burger‚Äù one of the \\"Twenty Hamburgers You Must Eat Before You Die.\\" In the article the magazine said ‚ÄúThe closer you come to a college campus, the worse burgers get‚Äù and that Sidetrack ‚Äúis an exception.‚Äù Oprah Winfrey had a segment on Gayle King's quest for eating the best burgers in America and according to Sidetrack's web site the bar and grill is mentioned. Sidetrack's menu also claims that they were voted second best restaurant outside Ann Arbor four times. The Betty Anne Waters Story Sidetrack Bar and Grill was closed for two days in March 2009 as it was used for location filming for the Hilary Swank film, Conviction. The film is based on the true story of a working mother who puts herself through law school in order to defend her brother after a wrongful murder conviction.

Concept In 1990 the established Japanese satellite television company WOWOW decided to expand their services into the field of satellite radio. The core management team made the executive decision to create a subsidiary named St.GIGA. The name was selected by a popular poll of \\"persons on the streets\\" because the executives agreed that they knew nothing about music. In deciding whom to hire as director for the subsidiary, (who had recently designed the successful J-Wave FM) was selected as an innovator in the field. Soon after accepting the position, Yokoi crafted a radical proposal for the station concept. The initial reaction at WOWOW was skeptical; however within a few months of traditional satellite radio broadcasts, Yokoi's concept was given probationary adoption, and Yokoi was subsequently given full discretion to shape the company's future. Yokoi's \\"Tide of Sound\\" Under Hiroshi Yokoi's direction, the St.GIGA station motto became \\"I'm here. ‚Äî I'm glad you're there. ‚Äî We are St.GIGA.\\"„Çª„É≥„Éà„ÇÆ„Ç¨„ÅÆ‰æã„ÅÆÂè∞Ë©û. St.GIGA.

Retrieved February 18, 2009. Yokoi's original concept proposal for St.GIGA would break new ground for broadcast communication methodology. In accordance with Yokoi's conception, St.GIGA's broadcasts initially followed no externally fixed (or artificial) timetable. Rather they were based upon the cyclical motif of a 24-hour \\"tide table\\"Toop, David & R√©veillon, Arnaud. Ocean of Sound: ambient music, mondes imaginaires et voix de l'√©ther. Editions Kargo. Pp. 164-5. 2000. where broadcast themes were approximately matched to the current tidal cycle according to the rule of twelfths throughout the 24-hour broadcasting period.„Çª„É≥„Éà„Éª„ÇÆ„Ç¨ „ÇÆ„É£„É©„É™„Éº ‚óè „Çø„Ç§„É†„ÉÜ„Éº„Éñ„É´.

The beginnings and ends of programs were not clearly demarcated and instead utilized the unprecedented method where songs of one genre would gradually flow into and intersperse with the songs from the prior genre until the new genre became predominant. The intent, according to Yokoi was to allow the listener to relax in a wave of sound \\"like a baby sleeps in the womb.\\" \\"Tide of Sounds\\" broadcasts operated under a principle of \\"No Commercials, No DJs, No News Broadcasts, No Talk.\\" Unlike most commercial-driven radio broadcasts, this was made possible for St.GIGA due to its reliance on a subscription Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) service. In order to receive this DAB service, the subscriber was required to obtain a special decoder, to pay an initiation fee, and subsequent monthly fees.Valenti, Gregory.

He also played an immense role in the establishment tabligh as well as da'wah among the non-Muslims of South Africa. Moulana Cassim Mohammed Sema was born in Newcastle. At the age of five, he commenced his education at Oswald's School in Newcastle. However, his education was terminated after the completion of standard six. Moulana completed the recitation of the Qur'an and studied Urdu under Moulana Hafiz Shamsuddin. Thereafter, he commenced the memorisation of the Qur'an under Hafiz Aminuddin, under whom he completed seven ajza. He then memorised two more ajza under Moulana Ali Ahmad Ansari. Moulana Mia of Watervaal Institute was an inspiration to Moulana when he visited Newcastle in 1935 and told Moulana to either study medicine or become an 'Alim abroad. Moulana chose to become an 'Alim and departed for India on 23 October 1935. There, he enrolled at Jami'a Islamiyya in Dabhel and completed the Alimiyya course. He eventually graduated in August 1942 at the age of twenty-two and decided to return to South Africa, where a post as a teacher awaited him in Mia's Farm. Unfortunately, World War II started and the operation of passenger ships terminated due to the risk of Japanese attacks. However, due to demand, a steamboat called Tilaawa was arranged to transport passengers to Africa. On 23 November 1942, it departed from Bombay with 1 000 passengers and 300 crew members. En route, it was attacked by Japanese torpedoes and sank. Moulana and 124 passengers were the only survivors. They were transported back to Bombay. Moulana was then employed by Majlis-e-'Ilmi in Simlak, where he taught Athar al-Sunan. He passed a year in Simlak, preparing his own meals and occasionally leading salaah at the masjid. Moulana left India and arrived in South Africa on 5 February 1944. He received a number of job offers, but accepted the offer from Wasbank. He taught in Wasbank and passed two years in the formulation of a madrasa syllabus. In 1949, Moulana started to propagate Islam within the African communities of the Msinga Reserve. Over a period of ten years, nine hundred people converted to Islam. On 30 October 1960, the first da'wah ijtima was held in Wasbank, after which a building that housed a masjid and madrasa was built in the Makhakhane area. Moulana was part of the first Tablighi Jama'ah of South Africa. In 1961, they travelled to Malawi for the first ijtima of southern Africa. He was instrumental in organising the first South African ijtima in Ladysmith later in 1961. A few months later, he travelled with the first South African jama'ah to India for four months. On his return, he was arrested at the Makhakhane Masjid because he had broken an apartheid law which stated that Indians were not allowed into African areas. He was fined and, for the next ten years, forced to fight for the protection of the Makhakhane Masjid, which the government wanted to destroy. During this period, da'wah and nightly madrasa sessions continued secretly. Then a masjid was established in Tugela Ferry, which the government also wanted to demolish. However, the masjid survived. Also, despite the oppressive laws of apartheid, Moulana regularly preached Islam at the Msinga Reserve. After twenty-three years of service in Wasbank, Moulana returned to Newcastle in 1968, becoming the principal of its madrasa. He lectured every Friday in Urdu, but shifted to English as the younger generation arrived. In 1967, the Jamiatul Ulama Kwazulu Natal met to devise a single madrasa syllabus for the entire province. Moulana's syllabus was chosen. Thereafter, Moulana worked with the Jamiatul Ulama KwaZulu-Natal for a year. He then established a furniture-manufacturing store in Alcockspruit, which was eventually closed due to new industrial laws. Moulana passed a few months as the principal of the madrasa and imam of the masjid of Glencoe, while negotiations in the purchase of land for a madrasa were finalised. Moulana had been attempting to establish a madrasa with boarding facilities since 1946. Eventually, in 1969, the building that had housed St. Dominics Academy, a Roman Catholic convent, which had been vacant for fifteen years, was bought for R 83 000. Darul Uloom Newcastle was opened on 13 May 1973. Moulana then decided to travel to the Indian subcontinent for a 40-day jama'ah before officially establishing the madrasa. In Pakistan, Moulana met his former teacher, Moulana Yusuf Binnori, who devised the curriculum of Darul Uloom Newcastle. Moulana then travelled to India and returned to South Africa thereafter. Classes at Darul Uloom Newcastle started on 9 September 1973 with nine boarding students. For the first three years, Moulana taught alone while his wife cooked the students' food and washed their clothes. The first jalsa was held on 4 December 1977, during which the first batch of students graduated from a three-year 'Alim course. However, in 1983, the first students completed the new six-year course. Moulana Cassim Mohammed Sema died on 9 June 2007 after an operation. He invited Mufti Ebrahim Smith and others in the beginning of the year and started the first Iftaa class which he conducted himself.His funeral was attended by almost 4 000 people. Hazrat Mufti Faiyaz Saheb whom Ml Sema appointed as the BUKHARI teacher lead the Janaaza Solah. Moulana was eighty-seven years old and had been teaching until the last year of his life.

August Frank is seated immediately to the right of Pohl in the defendants' box August Franz Frank (5 April 189821 March 1984) was a German SS functionary in the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office, generally known by its German initials WVHA. The WVHA was, among other things, responsible for the administration of the Nazi concentration camps. After the war, the higher WVHA officials, including Frank, were tried and convicted of crimes against humanity. Early Nazi career Frank joined the SS as a private on 1 May 1932, and the Nazi Party on 1 January 1933. From 1933 to 1935, Frank worked at minor administrative duties in connection with a number of small industries at the Dachau concentration camp manned by inmate labor, most of which were concerned with concentration camp maintenance. Rise in Nazi hierarchy In 1935, at the request of Oswald Pohl, Frank became SS Administrative Officer of the Special Purpose Troops (SS-Verf√ºgungstruppe) and of the concentration camp guards, the SS Death's Head units (SS-Totenkopfverb√§nde), although the presence of a bureaucratic rival somewhat limited his authority in the second capacity. In February 1940, Frank became chief supply officer of the Waffen SS and Death's Head units under Pohl. Concentration camp administrator When the WVHA was organized in 1942, he became Pohl's deputy chief of WVHA and chief of Department (Amtsgruppe) A, the administrative division of WVHA. He served in this capacity until 1 September 1943, when he was permitted to resign to become administrative chief of the Order Police. Amtsgruppe A was the administrative branch of WVHA. It comprised five offices (√Ñmter), as follows: * Amt A-1: budgets. * Amt A-2: finance and payroll. * Amt A-3: legal matters. * Amt A-4: auditing office. * Amt A-5: personnel. Involvement in the Holocaust SS Ethnic Germans Welfare Office (Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle), in Lodz, Poland, then occupied by Germany. On 26 September 1942 August Frank, an official of the SS concentration camp administration department, directed that all property of the Jews murdered in Operation Reinhard be diverted to this office. Jews in the Lodz ghetto in 1940. The yellow star can be clearly seen sewn on their clothing. By order of August Frank, once these people were murdered, their clothing would be salvaged and restributed to \\"ethnic\\" Germans Volksdeutsche, but only after care was taken to be sure the yellow star was removed. A measure of the detailed planning that Frank and other Nazis put into the carrying out of the Holocaust and the deprivation of the property of the murdered Jews can be gauged from a memorandum prepared by Frank on 26 September 1942. For example, Frank gave instructions on dealing with the underwear of the murder victims. This memorandum, when it came to light after the war, played a key role in refuting Frank's claims that he had no knowledge that Jews were being murdered en masse in the extermination camps of Operation Reinhard. The memorandum is also notable as an example of the use of the Nazi euphemism \\"evacuation\\" of the Jews, which meant their systematic murder. Crimes against humanity After World War II, Frank was placed on trial on accusations that during his work at WVHA he had committed crimes against humanity. The court concerned itself with Frank's conduct between 1 September 1939, and 1 September 1943. Frank's defense was that he thought the only people in concentration camps were solely composed of German nationals who were either habitual criminals or genuine threats to the Nazi regime. This argument was rejected by the court, which found that Frank knew of and actively participated in the Nazi slave labor program. The court held that the following evidence, among other things, showed Frank's knowledge of the international slave labor program that the Nazi concentration camps had become: * A letter from Oswald Pohl, dated 26 June 1942, to all Amtsgruppen chiefs (which would have included Frank), stating that the head of every branch office which was provided with prisoners or prisoners of war for work was responsible for the prevention of escape, robbery, and sabotage; * A letter signed by Oswald Pohl, but actually dictated by Frank, to Heinrich Himmler, which discussed the commanders of many of the concentration camps and their qualifications and recommendations for reassignments, detachments, and promotions. * Frank's memorandum of 26 September 1942 to SS administrators at Lublin and Auschwitz directing that the Jewish Star be removed from the garments of deceased inmates. Frank appears to have planned to personally profit from concentration camp labor. He was an incorporating partner with Georg L√∂rner, another WVHA official, in a leather and textile enterprise at Dachau. Based on this and other evidence, the court rejected Frank's testimony as incredible: Involvement in genocide Frank's lawyer claimed Frank \\"did not work for the political aims of National Socialism.\\" This position was rejected by the court: In particular, Frank at his trial claimed he only became aware of the Jewish extermination program after hearing Himmler's Posen speech on 4 October 1943, a month after he had left the WVHA. By this time, the Nazis had nearly completed the mass killings of the Jews of Poland and nearby areas of Eastern Europe in what has become known as Action Reinhard, also known as Operation Reinhard and the Reinhard action. Frank handled the huge amount of personal property that was either robbed from the Jews while they were alive or stolen from their bodies (there were 2,000 car loads of textiles, for instance). In his 26 September 1942 memorandum, Frank had chosen to designate this property as \\"Jewish concealed and stolen goods.\\" The court rejected Frank's claim that he couldn't have known of the source of these goods: Frank claimed that he didn't know and had no reason to know that the people from whom the property had come from had been murdered en masse; he testified that he thought all the property accumulating from Operation Reinhard had come from Jews who had died naturally in concentration camps. The court rejected this contention, relying again on the categories of property Frank had dealt with in his 26 September 1942 memorandum : Acquitted of mass murder Although the court had ruled that Frank was criminally answerable for the slave labor program and the looting of Jewish property, he escaped criminal liability for the murders themselves, as the court viewed him as generally being only involved after the people had already been murdered. Member of criminal organization (Nazi SS) Frank was found guilty also of being a member of a criminal organization, that is, the Nazi SS. Frank's highest rank in the SS was Lieutenant General (Obergruppenf√ºhrer). Sentence and commutation On 3 November 1947 Frank was sentenced to life in prison by the tribunal with the following words: In 1951 Frank's sentence was commuted to 15 years. He died in March 1984.

This was the first association in the United States that sought to rescue and reform wayward women. A number of local clergymen and citizens affiliated with Quaker, Episcopal and Presbyterian denominations met to form the Society. Bishop William White, the nation's highest-ranking Episcopal bishop, was the first president of the Society, which officially incorporated in 1802. The organization was based on Magdalen hospitals in England and Ireland, which were named for Mary Magdalene. Similarly designated groups were soon started in other American cities in the early 19th century. Background The Magdalen Society of Philadelphia, a private charitable organization was founded in 1807. The stated purpose of Philadelphia's Magdalen Society was \\"restoring to the paths of virtue those unhappy females who in unguarded hours have been robbed of their innocence.\\"Teeters, Negley K.. ‚ÄúThe Early Days of the Magdalen Society of Philadelphia‚Äù. Social Service Review 30.2 (1956): 158‚Äì167 The president of the Society was Bishop William White, rector of Christ Church; the vice-president was Robert Wharton, mayor of Philadelphia. To accomplish its mission, the Society in 1808 opened the Magdalen Asylum on the northeast corner of Schuylkill Second (now 21st) and Race Streets, at . It was operated by the Society's Board of Managers, and initially housed about a dozen prostitutes and other errant women. The Magdalen Asylum stood on this site for more than a century, until 1916. In 1988-1898, an archeological investigation of the site was conducted in connection with the construction of the Franklin Institute's Futures Center, which now overlaps the site. Operation The women that the asylum admitted were called magdalens and were assigned a number in the order they entered the facility. They were mostly young immigrant women between the ages of 17 and 23 who were aimless, family-less, unsupported and in need of help. They generally did not share the Magdalen Society's image of their \\"guilt and wretchedness,\\" but instead simply sought a sanctuary from disease, the prison or almshouse, unhappy family situations, abusive men, and dire economic circumstances. In its early years, the Magdalen Society Asylum functioned as a refuge for prostitutes. Most of these stayed only a few days or a few weeks, just long enough to get reclothed and recuperated. Attempts at rehabilitation met with little success. In 1877, the asylum was changed into a home for wayward girls, with a rule requiring a stay for twelve months. As the Magdalen Society Asylum became more selective, relaxed its emphasis on personal guilt and salvation, and standardized in some respects the treatment of the inmates, its rate of failure diminished.Ruggles, Stephen. \\"Fallen Women: The Inmates Of The Magdalens Society Asylum Of Philadelphia, 1836-1908\\", Journal of Social History A much larger Magdalen Home was erected at the same locality in the 1840s. This building separated the inmates (\\"magdalens\\") from the staff, and recalcitrant inmates from new arrivals. Fences and eventually a 13-foot wall were built around the property to keep the magdalens from seeing or otherwise interacting with the encroaching city. The Philadelphia Magdalen Society lodged 2,726 women in all, attempting to change them into domestic servants, factory workers, seamstresses or laundresses‚Äîand sometimes even returning the inmates to their families, hopefully with a more \\"proper\\" mindset. Still, even the Board of Managers conceded that few magdalens were converted to lives of virtue. So the Society began to focus on preventing waywardness and providing education to girls.\\"Magdalen Society of Philadelphis\\", The Historical Society of Pennsylvania The Home for Magdalens moved to Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, in 1915, about the time that it was becoming clear that the refuge had outlived its usefulness. Other private organizations and state institutions had become concerned with the treatment of \\"delinquent\\" girls, and the asylum's functions had been taken over by city courts, which placed youthful offenders on probation rather than committing them to institutions. White- Williams Foundation for Girls The Society began to seek a new direction for its work. It wanted to find ways to prevent the delinquency it had worked to treat for over a hundred years. The Board of Managers voted to address the heart of the problem by providing direction and assistance to steer children away from trouble. Accordingly, the Magdalen Society changed its name to White-Williams Foundation for Girls in 1918. (The name honored Bishop William White and George Williams, a Quaker philanthropist and former Board chairman.) White-Williams began the service that it continues today: providing stipends to needy Philadelphia students. White-Williams Scholars visit area colleges, attend cultural events and career exploration workshops, and participate in peer support groups.\\"Philly mentoring organizations know it takes a village\\", Philadelphia Inquirer, June 10, 2003 Now known as White-Williams Scholars, the organization currently serves both male and female pupils in Philadelphia public high schools.

They are basic summary statistics, used in descriptive statistics such as the five-number summary and Bowley's seven-figure summary and the associated box plot. The minimum and the maximum value are the first and last order statistics (often denoted X(1) and X(n) respectively, for a sample size of n). If the sample has outliers, they necessarily include the sample maximum or sample minimum, or both, depending on whether they are extremely high or low. However, the sample maximum and minimum need not be outliers, if they are not unusually far from other observations. Robustness The sample maximum and minimum are the least robust statistics: they are maximally sensitive to outliers. This can either be an advantage or a drawback: if extreme values are real (not measurement errors), and of real consequence, as in applications of extreme value theory such as building dikes or financial loss, then outliers (as reflected in sample extrema) are important. On the other hand, if outliers have little or no impact on actual outcomes, then using non-robust statistics such as the sample extrema simply cloud the statistics, and robust alternatives should be used, such as other quantiles: the 10th and 90th percentiles (first and last decile) are more robust alternatives. Derived statistics In addition to being a component of every statistic that uses all elements of the sample, the sample extrema are important parts of the range, a measure of dispersion, and mid-range, a measure of location. They also realize the maximum absolute deviation: one of them is the furthest point from any given point, particularly a measure of center such as the median or mean. Applications Smooth maximum  For a sample set, the maximum function is non-smooth and thus non-differentiable. For optimization problems that occur in statistics it often needs to be approximated by a smooth function that is close to the maximum of the set. A smooth maximum, for example, : g(x1, x2, ‚Ä¶, xn) = log( exp(x1) + exp(x2) + ‚Ä¶ + exp(xn) ) is a good approximation of the sample maximum. Summary statistics The sample maximum and minimum are basic summary statistics, showing the most extreme observations, and are used in the five-number summary and a version of the seven-number summary and the associated box plot. Prediction interval The sample maximum and minimum provide a non- parametric prediction interval: in a sample from a population, or more generally an exchangeable sequence of random variables, each observation is equally likely to be the maximum or minimum. Thus if one has a sample \\\\\\\\{X_1,\\\\dots,X_n\\\\\\\\}, and one picks another observation X_{n+1}, then this has 1/(n+1) probability of being the largest value seen so far, 1/(n+1) probability of being the smallest value seen so far, and thus the other (n-1)/(n+1) of the time, X_{n+1} falls between the sample maximum and sample minimum of \\\\\\\\{X_1,\\\\dots,X_n\\\\\\\\}. Thus, denoting the sample maximum and minimum by M and m, this yields an (n-1)/(n+1) prediction interval of [m,M]. For example, if n = 19, then [m,M] gives an 18/20 = 90% prediction interval ‚Äì 90% of the time, the 20th observation falls between the smallest and largest observation seen heretofore. Likewise, n = 39 gives a 95% prediction interval, and n = 199 gives a 99% prediction interval. Estimation Due to their sensitivity to outliers, the sample extrema cannot reliably be used as estimators unless data is clean ‚Äì robust alternatives include the first and last deciles. However, with clean data or in theoretical settings, they can sometimes prove very good estimators, particularly for platykurtic distributions, where for small data sets the mid-range is the most efficient estimator. They are inefficient estimators of location for mesokurtic distributions, such as the normal distribution, and leptokurtic distributions, however. =Uniform distribution= For sampling without replacement from a uniform distribution with one or two unknown endpoints (so 1,2,\\\\dots,N with N unknown, or M,M+1,\\\\dots,N with both M and N unknown), the sample maximum, or respectively the sample maximum and sample minimum, are sufficient and complete statistics for the unknown endpoints; thus an unbiased estimator derived from these will be UMVU estimator. If only the top endpoint is unknown, the sample maximum is a biased estimator for the population maximum, but the unbiased estimator \\\\frac{k+1}{k}m - 1 (where m is the sample maximum and k is the sample size) is the UMVU estimator; see German tank problem for details. If both endpoints are unknown, then the sample range is a biased estimator for the population range, but correcting as for maximum above yields the UMVU estimator. If both endpoints are unknown, then the mid-range is an unbiased (and hence UMVU) estimator of the midpoint of the interval (here equivalently the population median, average, or mid-range). The reason the sample extrema are sufficient statistics is that the conditional distribution of the non-extreme samples is just the distribution for the uniform interval between the sample maximum and minimum ‚Äì once the endpoints are fixed, the values of the interior points add no additional information. Normality testing Sample extrema can be used for normality testing, as events beyond the 3œÉ range are very rare. The sample extrema can be used for a simple normality test, specifically of kurtosis: one computes the t-statistic of the sample maximum and minimum (subtracts sample mean and divides by the sample standard deviation), and if they are unusually large for the sample size (as per the three sigma rule and table therein, or more precisely a Student's t-distribution), then the kurtosis of the sample distribution deviates significantly from that of the normal distribution. For instance, a daily process should expect a 3œÉ event once per year (of calendar days; once every year and a half of business days), while a 4œÉ event happens on average every 40 years of calendar days, 60 years of business days (once in a lifetime), 5œÉ events happen every 5,000 years (once in recorded history), and 6œÉ events happen every 1.5 million years (essentially never). Thus if the sample extrema are 6 sigmas from the mean, one has a significant failure of normality. Further, this test is very easy to communicate without involved statistics. These tests of normality can be applied if one faces kurtosis risk, for instance. Extreme value theory Events can be beyond the extreme of any previously observed, as in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. Sample extrema play two main roles in extreme value theory: * firstly, they give a lower bound on extreme events ‚Äì events can be at least this extreme, and for this size sample; * secondly, they can sometimes be used in estimators of probability of more extreme events. However, caution must be used in using sample extrema as guidelines: in heavy-tailed distributions or for non-stationary processes, extreme events can be significantly more extreme than any previously observed event. This is elaborated in black swan theory.

This is the central square of the city and one of the symbols of the executive power of the nation. Its main feature is the monument to the independence heroes of August 10, 1809, date remembered as the First Cry of Independence of the Royal Audience of Quito from spanish monarchy. The square is flanked by the Carondelet Palace, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Archbishop's Palace, the Municipal Palace and the Plaza Grande Hotel. The square is surrounded by the following four streets: Calle Venezuela (east), Calle Chile (north), Calle Gabriel Garc√≠a Moreno (west) and the pedestrian segment of Calle Eugenio Espejo (south).  History  Palacio Arzobispal de Quito - An√≥nimo - 19th century - (siglo XIX) Plaza de la Independencia. Although the first colonial town square was what today is known as Plazoleta Benalc√°zar, this has always been considered as tentative as it got up a path suitable for novice Spanish town of Quito. It was only in the 17th century, in the year 1612, when the powers of the city moved to the area around the Plaza Grande, they decided to call this way for being the largest at the time.  Creation  Initially it was just an esplanade of packed dirt that was placed in a water source to supply the vital liquid to the neighbors. Being larger than the tentative square, and unemployed land still be around, some institutions decided to stand on its flanks. Thus the Catholic Church acquired land in the north and south sides, where they built the main temple of the city (Cathedral of Quito) and the headquarters of the archdiocese (Archbishop's Palace). One of the founders of the city, the Captain Juan de D√≠az Hidalgo, reserved to himself a lot on the corner of the square near the Archbishop's Palace, where he built his home (the only private building that endures to this day) that palace would later be called Palacio Hidalgo. Other families, also founders of the town, occupied the western end, but after the earthquake of 1627, were overturned by the serious damage that occurred in structures, and instead built the Palacio de Carondelet. Finally, on the eastern side of the square was constructed the structure for the nascent city council, construction was also demolished in the 1970s to build the city hall known as Municipality of Quito, for if it fulfills the same functions as the original, is a modern building.  16th to 19th centuries  For several years after its founding, the Plaza Grande was nothing but a paved plaza with a beautiful fountain in the center, around which rose at times a makeshift bullring to celebrate some festivities offered by the council on behalf of the Spanish crown. Only in the eighteenth century it thinks of the place as a true square, the style of European cities. The president of the Royal Audience of Quito conceived the square landscapes, to serve as a garden for the Palacio de Carondelet. The palace topped its steps in the square and prohibited the passage of carts through the western edge of the square, which was next to Carondelet. The square was reformed again in the early nineteenth century; withdraw the steps of the palace, now ended in the side streets of the building, and enabled again the passage of cars by the then called Calle de las 7 Cruces (now Garcia Moreno).  Modern period  After many petitions by the municipal authorities, Ecuadorian President Eloy Alfaro ordered the construction in the Plaza of a monument to commemorate the centenary of the \\"first cry of independence\\". A French sculpture was commissioned in 1898 and placed in the center of the square, replacing the fountain which was moved to the southwest of the square. In a public ceremony in 1906, the President and Mayor unveiled the \\"Independence Monument\\" and changed the colonial name (\\"Plaza Grande\\") to \\"Plaza de la Independencia\\". Since then only minor changes have been made in the square, which retains its centrality in the national consciousness.

Raised in July 1942 as the 2/8th Independent Company, the 2/8th spent the early years of the war performing garrison duties in the Northern Territory. In July 1944, the 2/8th sailed to Lae, in New Guinea from where they launched a clandestine reconnaissance operation on the island of New Britain. Later, attached to the II Corps, it participated in the Bougainville campaign, during which it was in action continuously for a period of nine months right up until the Japanese surrendered in August 1945. Following the end of hostilities, the 2/8th returned to Australia, and was disbanded at Liverpool, New South Wales in early January 1946. History Formation and home duties The 2/8th Independent Company was formed at Wilsons Promontory, in Victoria in July 1942. Consisting of 17 officers and 256 other ranks, the company was organised into a headquarters, three infantry platoons, with attached signals, medical and engineering sections. It undertook training at the Guerilla Warfare School that had been set up there, before being sent to northern Australia to serve in a garrison role.Long 1963, p. 106. During this time the company was stationed at Yandina, Queensland, and then later at the Adelaide River, in the Northern Territory. In 1943, as part of a re-organisation of the independent company concept, the 2/8th were renamed the 2/8th Cavalry (Commando) Squadron, which was later shortened to the 2/8th Commando Squadron. Despite this re- organisation, however, while other commando squadrons were amalgamated together into a regimental structure,Horner 1989, p. 26. the 2/8th remained independent and when they finally deployed overseas in mid-1944 to New Guinea, they were sent as an independent unit attached to the Australian II Corps.Long 1963, p. 99. New Britain campaign The squadron embarked from Townsville, Queensland, on 22 July 1944 and sailed to Lae, via Milne Bay, on board the SS Ormiston.Astill 1996, p. 21. While they were there they received an intake of 70 experienced men from some of the other commando squadrons as reinforcements. Following this, the squadron undertook a period of jungle warfare training.Astill 1996, pp. 23‚Äì29. After a few months, in mid-September, a small detachment of the 2/8th participated in a small-scale reconnaissance operation at Jacquinot Bay on the island of New Britain, to collect intelligence in preparation for an assault by the 5th Division.Astill 1996, p. 24. As part of this operation, elements from 'C' Troop and a small detachment from 'B' Troop, from the 2/8th Commando Squadron, provided the protection force for the reconnaissance party that was put ashore from the corvette HMAS Kiama, setting up a position on the beach and conducting a number of patrols further inland. This operation was a success and later, in November, the 5th Division conducted an amphibious landing in the area unopposed.Long 1963, p. 247. Bougainville campaign A member of the 2/8th Commando Squadron armed with a Bren light machine gun photographed after returning from a patrol in June 1945 In October, the 2/8th was transported on the troopship Aconagua to Torokina,Astill 1996, p. 29. which was the main Australian base on Bougainville, where it joined the rest of II Corps, who were concentrating in the area for the upcoming Bougainville campaign.Long 1963, p. 99 & 106. As the campaign progressed the squadron conducted patrols from Torokina to Kuraio Mission and Amun in the northern sectorThe Bougainville campaign was fought across three sectors, the northern, central and southern sectors, see Long 1963, pp. 89‚Äì115 for further information. on a weekly basis throughout November and into December, before handing over responsibility of the area to the 11th Brigade and being transferred to the southern sector. This was where the main battle for Bougainville was being fought, and as the 3rd Division advanced along the coast towards the Japanese base at Buin, the 2/8th was tasked to provide flank protection for the division. As a part of this, they conducted a number of reconnaissance patrols, often moving part of the way by barge, as well as conducting ambushes in order to keep the enemy off balance. This lasted for almost nine months from December 1944 right up to the end of the war in August 1945, during which time the 2/8th was in action almost continuously. It was a long and hard campaign, and to a large extent this made up for the long periods of inactivity that the squadron had suffered while it had been garrisoned in Australia. Certainly the squadron was in the thick of it, with many of its members distinguishing themselves during this time, as evidenced by the rather large number of decorations 2/8th members earned in such a short space of time. The patrols during this time were conducted in small groups, usually no larger than two sections roughly 18‚Äì20 men, and they would last for between four and six days, although some lasted up to nine. Sometimes they would employ barges to move along the coast. Having secured the coastal regions around the Jaba River, the squadron slowly began to move inland in order to strike into the enemy's rear, securing the many villages along the way. First they cleared to Sovele Mission, then the villages of Opai, Nihero and Morokaimoro, reaching Kilipaijino by the end of hostilities. As they went, each village taken became a patrol base and from there the squadron would gather topographical information such as track and terrain reports, and locate the enemy. Once sufficient information had been gathered and passed on to II Corps, the patrols would then attempt to ambush the enemy or try to take a prisoner. These raids were very effective in tying down the enemy and keeping them away from the 3rd Division's flanks, as they forced the Japanese to deploy troops to their rear areas, removing men from the front against which the larger infantry forces were then be able to engage. Disbandment With the end of the war, as part of the large-scale demobilisation of Australian forces, the commando squadrons along with most of the other special forces units formed by the Australian Army were deemed surplus to requirementsHorner 1989, p. 27. and the ranks of the squadron were slowly reduced as men who had earned enough points to do so were discharged, while others who did not were transferred to other units for further duties as part of the occupation forces that were being sent to Japan. By the time that the squadron returned to Australia in December 1945 with a very small frontage. Finally, on 10 January 1946,Astill 1996, p. 89. while at Liverpool, New South Wales, the 2/8th Commando Squadron was disbanded and removed from the Australian Order of Battle. During its service, the 2/8th lost seven men killed in action and 16 men wounded. Members of the squadron received the following decorations: one Officer of the Order of the British Empire, two Distinguished Conduct Medals, four Military Medals and 12 Mentions in Despatches. Commanding officers The following officers served as commanding officer of the 2/8th: * Major Colin Wykeham Bayly, MC;Bayly won his Military Cross while serving as a captain with the 2/11th Infantry Battalion in the Wewak area.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on March 15, 2009. In the episode, Peter cashes in an old raffle ticket from 1989 and wins a golf outing with O. J. Simpson. When he befriends Simpson and brings him home to meet the family, the residents of Quahog are not as welcoming of the infamous running back and try to force him out of town. The episode was written by Andrew Goldberg and directed by Cyndi Tang. According to Nielsen ratings, the episode was viewed in 7.21 million homes in its original airing. The episode received negative reviews for its use of a three-minute long live-action segment of Conway Twitty. Series regular Mike Henry provided the voice of O. J. Simpson, Cathy Cahlin Ryan guest starred as Fred Goldman's wife in a cutaway, and Jeff Bergman guest starred as a parody of Homer Simpson. Plot According to an opening title card, this is one of several recently discovered \\"lost episodes\\" found in the Griffin family basement; it takes place in March 2007, prior to O. J. Simpson's September 2007 arrest for armed robbery. Lois goes to her book club and asks Peter to babysit Stewie. Instead, he invites Cleveland, Quagmire and Joe and they all play Truth or Dare, which results in a make out session between Cleveland and Joe. After a fiasco involving Stewie attempting to fix their satellite TV, and getting stuck on the roof, due to Peter's lack of supervision, Brian tries to tell Peter but he does not listen and instead reads a magazine featuring Nick Jonas. After Peter starts a pillow fight that turns violent, Lois comes in after Cleveland accidentally punches her in the nose, angry at Peter for not watching Stewie, who has gotten stuck on the roof. Peter attempts to go fix the satellite himself, at which point he comes across a raffle ticket from 1989 that he had forgotten to cash in, winning him a chance to play golf with a celebrity of his choice. Ultimately, he chose O. J. Simpson. Unaware at first of Simpson's accusation for the murders of his wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, he grows fearful after Joe convinces him to walk around town with the song \\"Dust in the Wind\\" while thinking about the murders. Ultimately deciding to cash in the ticket, his friends suggest he spy on Simpson during the golf game and try to get him to confess to the murders. Hooking Peter to a wire, his cover is blown when the device shorts out. Simpson laments having lost a chance of escaping the accusation. Feeling guilty, Peter decides that Simpson is actually innocent, and decides to befriend him. Peter brings Simpson home with him to meet the family, who are initially less tolerant of Simpson than Peter. Brian tries to tell Peter that he should not trust Simpson just because he idolized him as a child but Peter refuses. Deciding to let Simpson stay at their house, word soon gets out of Simpson's presence in Quahog, causing Peter to decide to throw a house party and help everyone else get to know him better. Later that day, Peter and Simpson are met with an angry mob instead led by Mayor Adam West, intent on driving the latter out of town. Desperate for a place to live without being bothered by furious citizens, Simpson makes a heartfelt speech, professing that he is just as imperfect as everyone else, causing the residents of Quahog to apologize and embrace with him. A split second later, however, the tables turn to a surprise ending as Simpson takes out a knife and kills three people before running off. A furious mob goes on to chase after Simpson, as the Griffins look on, with Peter, wearing a guilty disappointed look, indifferently declaring, \\"I guess he did do it.\\" Production O. J. Simpson was sentenced to 33 years imprisonment in 2008 for his involvement in a robbery \\"The Juice Is Loose\\" was written by Andrew Goldberg and directed by Cyndi Tang. The writing process began when Goldberg was creator Seth MacFarlane's assistant and was given a freelance episode. He wrote \\"Believe It or Not, Joe's Walking on Air\\", and executive producer David A. Goodman thought he did a \\"fantastic job\\". Goldberg submitted a three-page list of ideas for his next episode, and MacFarlane especially liked the story for \\"The Juice Is Loose\\". They had to add a title card in the beginning of the episode saying that it was a \\"lost episode\\", as O. J. Simpson was sent to jail before the episode aired. The episode features a three-minute long segment of an archive video of Conway Twitty performing \\"I See the Want To in Your Eyes\\", and executive producer Chris Sheridan had to explain to the Fox executives why the segment should be featured in the episode. Series regular Mike Henry provided the voice of O. J. Simpson in the episode, and Cathy Cahlin Ryan guest starred as Fred Goldman's wife in a cutaway gag. In addition to Henry and Ryan, actors Reid Bruton, Jules Green, Augie Castagnola, Virenia Lind guest starred in the episode. Recurring voice actors Jeff Bergman, Max Burkholder, Ralph Garman, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin, and writer John Viener made minor appearances in the episode. Reception In its original airing on March 15, 2009, \\"The Juice is Loose\\" was watched by 7.21 million households and acquired a 3.6 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. It was the most-watched show in the \\"Animation Domination\\" block, surpassing The Simpsons, American Dad! and King of the Hill. The episode received mixed reviews from television sources and critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN gave \\"The Juice Is Loose\\" 5.5/10, saying that the episode was \\"a largely forgettable episode with only a few moments of brilliance\\". The review criticized the usage of a three-minute long Conway Twitty live action singing clip which was received as an \\"effort to reduce the amount of animation ... for the episode\\". Alex Rocha of TV Guide said that he \\"did enjoy this episode\\" but called the Conway Twitty clip a \\"filler\\" and that he would have wanted to see a \\"blank screen or even commercials\\" instead. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club stated that the episode \\"relied on an overabundance of pop culture riffs far too dated to elicit much more than a brief chuckle\\", and also criticized the Conway Twitty clip.

He is currently the Co-CEO of TPG. Previously, he served as the Co-President of Goldman Sachs Group from 2006 to February 2009. He is known for suddenly retiring at the peak of his career at age 49 from Goldman Sachs. Early life and education Winkelreid grew up in Millburn, New Jersey, the son of a Jewish father, Irwin, who managed local parking garages, and a mother who was a schoolteacher.CNN Money: \\"The man who walked away from Goldman Sachs\\" By William D. Cohan January 26, 2010 He attended the University of Chicago where he earned both an undergraduate degree and an MBA and played baseball. While in school he joined Phi Gamma Delta with his good friend Byron Trott who was also on the baseball team. Career Winkelried worked as an intern in the trading department at Goldman Sachs in the summer prior to graduating in 1982. He later accepted a permanent job at Goldman in the investment banking department in the Utilities Group. In 1984, he moved to the trading floor and soon was heading up the bond syndication business. In 1990, he became a partner. From there, he moved to London to turn around the European side of the Goldman's fixed-income, currency, and commodities business (known as FICC). He was made co-head of FICC with Lloyd Blankfein. Cohn and Winkelried were a good team but were more competitors than friends. FICC was returned to solid profitability. In June 2006, Goldman's CEO Hank Paulson, Winkelreid's mentor, accepted a position as the Secretary of the Treasury under President George W. Bush. Blankfein was appointed the new CEO and Winkelried was made co-chief operating officer and co-president with Gary Cohn. Their responsibilities were divided with Cohn running the trading and asset management side of the business (including FICC) and Winkelried responsible for investment and merchant banking. Eventually Cohn's business lines were outperforming his own and Winkelreid, sensing that his position was tenuous (especially as Cohn was very close to Blankfein) decided that he would leave the firm. His last act would be to secure a $5B convertible preferred investment from Warren Buffett in Goldman during the financial crisis to secure the company's solvency. Blankfein was not happy with his decision to leave. Winkelried was named Co-CEO of TPG in October 2015.https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/business/dealbook/former-goldman- executive-winkelried-said-to-join-tpg.html Personal life Winkelried has been married to Abby Lipsey, a preschool teacher, since 1986.

From 2008 until 2013, he served as a member of the Pittsburgh City Council from District 7, which includes the neighborhoods of Bloomfield, East Liberty, Friendship, Garfield, Highland Park, Lawrenceville, Morningside, Polish Hill, and Stanton Heights. Personal life and educational career Dowd was raised in Chesterfield, Missouri and earned a B.A. from the University of Missouri. He moved to Pittsburgh in 1991 to study with Fritz Ringer in the Department of History at the University of Pittsburgh, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1999. He has taught history first at Winchester Thurston School and then at The Ellis School. He is married to Leslie Hammond, who also graduated from the University of Pittsburgh before becoming a lecturer in the history department. They have six children and live in Highland Park. Political career Pittsburgh Board of Education In 2003, Dowd won a four-year term on the Board after defeating incumbent Board President and Democrat Darlene Harris in an upset. As a candidate for school board, Dowd pledged to restore accountability to the system and in an intensely heated January 26, 2005 board meeting. Dowd led a five members coalition to removing Dr. John Thompson as the Superintend of the Pittsburgh Public Schools. The board launched a national search for a superintendent. The board hired Mark Roosevelt. Dowd's departure from the board came in December 2007. His Accountability Contract and evaluation model remained in effect as did RISE, a program of teacher evaluation and PELA, a program for principals. Pittsburgh City Council Dowd was elected as the Democratic nominee to represent District 7 on the Pittsburgh City Council on May 15, 2007, and won the seat unopposed on November 6, 2007. (Primary elections are generally decisive in the heavily Democratic city of Pittsburgh. ) He began serving on January 7, 2008. Shortly after taking office, Dowd drafted and successfully encouraged his colleagues to sign a Proclamation to Improve Governance in Pittsburgh. Dowd also crafted and council passed a resolution calling for a task force on intergovernmental cooperation which led to the creation of CONNECT, a Pittsburgh-based development initiative to increase cooperation between Pittsburgh and its adjacent municipalities. In May, 2008, Dowd also started an innovative constituent outreach program called Council-to-Go which enables him to stay in regular contact with residents of his council district. Dowd consistently worked with Ravenstahl to bring increased focus on bike and pedestrian initiatives. In 2010 Dowd led a coalition that included Council President Harris, Councilwoman Rudiak and Controller Lamb and that offered a viable alternative to Ravenstahl's proposed 50-year lease of all public parking assets in the Pittsburgh. In the fall of 2011 the state accepted this plan. As a member of the board of the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, Dowd made customer service and infrastructure reinvestment top priorities. In 2009, PWSA launched a controversial water and sewer line insurance program that has successfully provided coverage to nearly 100,000 customers That same year, Dowd was instrumental in the creation of the Distribution Infrastructure System Reinvestment Fund, which added 5% charge to customers bills and dedicated that revenue solely to infrastructure reinvestment. In 2010, Dowd supported the PWSA administration in bid to reinvest in its antiquated information system. Dowd also led the effort to bring an outside management firm in on an interim basis to overhaul the management of the Authority. Veolia of North America began their innovative contractual relationship with PWSA in July, 2012. They are scheduled to be in Pittsburgh until December, 2014. In 2011 Dowd and Judge Frank Lucchino led a voter initiative to create a new library tax in Pittsburgh. The ballot initiative called for the creation of a 0.25 mills property tax dedicated to the Carnegie Library and received the backing of 72% of Pittsburgh voters. Dowd announced in June 2013 that he would resign his seat on city council effective in mid-July to become the inaugural executive director of Allies for Children, a start-up advocacy nonprofit focused on children. A special election to fill his seat was held with the regularly scheduled municipal election in November 2013. The seat on city council was won by Deborah Gross, the endorsed Democrat in the race. Dowd also served as a member of the board of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh,http://clpgh.org/ Mayoral campaign Dowd announced on February 19, 2009 that he would challenge mayor Luke Ravenstahl in Pittsburgh's May 19 Democratic primary. In his announcement, Dowd criticized what he saw as Ravenstahl's failures on campaign finance reform in light of the mayor's veto of a campaign finance reform bill in the summer of 2008, a risky bond deal at the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, wasteful spending and the Lamar LED controversy. Dowd was endorsed by the Stonewall Democrats and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, among others, but lost in a three-way race to Ravenstahl by 31 points, receiving 28 percent of the vote. Allies for Children Dowd has led Allies for Children since its formation in 2013. The organization serves as a bold voice for policy changes that improve the lives of children in Allegheny County. Allies for Children works in coalition with many nonprofits bringing together the voices of those they serve to elevate the important policy issues and move policy makers to act in the best interest of children. In 2018, Allies for Children led a large coalition and a referendum campaign to increase access for early childhood education and after school programs. Allegheny County Children's Fund Initiative In 2018, as executive director of Allies for Children, Dowd led Our kids. Our Commitment. The Allegheny County Children's Fund initiative. The goal of the initiative was to improve access across Allegheny Count to early childhood learning, afterschool programs and nutritious meals.https://ourkidsourcommitment.org/priorities/ In May, a coalition of ten nonprofits, supported by dozens of others, announced their intention to launch a petition effort to place a question on the Allegheny County November General Election ballot. Between June and August, the coalition gathered nearly 64,000 and successfully placed their question on the ballot. The question, which was accompanied by an amendment to the Allegheny County Home Rule Charter, read as follows: ‚ÄúShall the Allegheny County Home Rule Charter be amended to establish the Allegheny County Children‚Äôs Fund, funded by Allegheny County levying and collecting an additional 0.25 mills, the equivalent of $25 on each $100,000 of assessed value, on all taxable real estate, beginning January 1, 2019 and thereafter, to be used to improve the well-being of children through the provision of services throughout the County including early childhood learning, after school programs, and nutritious meals?\\" On November 6, 2018 more than 518,206 votes were cast: YES = 251,010 NO = 267,196.https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/PA/Allegheny/92253/Web02.222611/#/cid/0133 References External links *City Council District 7 *Patrick Dowd for Mayor Category:Living people Category:1968 births Category:Politicians from St. Louis Category:Pennsylvania Democrats Category:Pittsburgh City Council members Category:University of Missouri alumni ","title":"Patrick Dowd"},{"id":"21603151","text":"The Teledyne CAE J69 was a small turbojet engine originally produced by Continental Aviation and Engineering (CAE) under license from Turbomeca.

It is the custodian of the largest and most significant documentary heritage collection about Queensland. Established in 1959, Queensland State Archives promotes the implementation of appropriate recordkeeping principles and practices across public authorities and regulates the retention and disposal of public records. Queensland State Archives develops recordkeeping policy and provides advice to public authorities on the management of public records and facilitates access to information about government for the people of Queensland. Under sections 24 and 25 of the Public Records Act 2002, Queensland State Archives has a range of functions and powers including the ability to: * Issue standards regulating the creation, management, disposal, storage and preservation of government records * Conduct research and provide advice to public authorities about the making, managing and preserving of public records * Issue policies, standards and guidelines to achieve compliance with the legislative policy frameworks for best practice records management * Ensure the archival collection is accessible to government and the people of Queensland * Identify and preserve public records of permanent value as the State‚Äôs archives * Provide climate- controlled storage facilities for permanent archival records. History Old Government House, Brisbane City, 1898 Recordkeeping in Queensland is not just a modern or new activity. As early as November 1861, an extract from the Brisbane Courier refers to provision of storage for valuable historical documents relating to the early history of the settlement.Brisbane Courier, November 1861 In 1917 the Royal Historical Society of Queensland called for a \\"proper system of dealing with the archives of Queensland\\".Journal of the Historical Society of Queensland, Vol.1, no.3, August 1917, p.107 Later, in 1932 the Governor of Queensland, Sir Leslie Wilson wrote to the Premier of Queensland, William Forgan Smith regarding a Central Record Office expressing his concern at the inadequate storage and subsequent destruction of many valuable public records.Queensland State Archives Item ID 863104, Correspondence ‚Äì Chief Secretary and Premier's Department, In letter 6841, 15 December 1932 In 1939, Sir Raphael Cilento (a former Vice-President of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland) commented that a Department of Archives should be established. Libraries Act 1943 When the Queensland Government passed the Libraries Act of 1943, Part IV of the Act dealt with public records. However, there was a provision in Part IV to postpone its implementation and archival legislation was not implemented for another 15 years. In 1953 the Government claimed that \\"it has not been possible to implement this portion of the Act owing to difficulties which have arisen, chief of which has been a lack of suitable space in which to store and display these documents.\\"Journal of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, Vol XIII, no.8, November 1988 Votes and Proceedings, 13 October 1953 While some records were transferred to the State Library of Queensland for preservation, it was not until 31 July 1958 that Part IV of The Libraries Act 1943‚Äì1949 was proclaimed and became effective.Queensland State Archives: The First Thirty Years, Library Board of Qld, 1989 In 1959, Robert Sharman was appointed as the first Archivist within the State Library, and Queensland State Archives commenced its activities. The Act placed archival authority in the hands of the State Librarian and made the Library Board of Queensland responsible for the destruction of records. The official position of State Archivist was not created until more than 20 years later in September 1981. Genealogy interest and the associated challenges Bundaberg Surf Life Saving Club Members, Nielson Park, Burnett Shire, c.1931 By the late 1970s and early 1980s a surge in genealogical and family history research created a heavy demand for reference services and access to records. The Queensland State Archives Public Search Room was expanded to accommodate more clients and a modern storage warehouse in Acacia Ridge was acquired in 1983. The State Archivist of the day, Paul Wilson focused on Queensland State Archives' role in the management of semi-current records, including the preparation of a wide range of retention and disposal schedules. In 1986 Queensland State Archives was accorded the status of a Division of the State Library of Queensland and developed a proposal for a new purpose-built facility. The Libraries and Archives Act 1988 defined the role and functions of Queensland State Archives and gave additional protection to public records through an increase in the powers of the State Archivist. It also expanded the definition of public records to include computerised records. Public Records Act 2002 The Queensland Government introduced the Public Records Act 2002 in July 2002. It replaced Part 7 (sections 56‚Äì67) of the Libraries and Archives Act 1988 and the Libraries and Archives Regulations 1990 with a new statute devoted specifically to the management of public records. The Act provided a contemporary framework for the management of public records and also marked a changing role for Queensland State Archives. Queensland State Archives is established under section 21 of the Public Records Act 2002 (the Act) as the State's archives and records management authority. With the introduction of the Act, Queensland State Archives became the lead agency for State and local government recordkeeping in Queensland. The Act and its accompanying Recordkeeping Information Standards enable Queensland State Archives to develop and implement a comprehensive recordkeeping policy framework to ensure a consistent approach to the creation, management, disposal, storage, preservation, and retrieval of government information. Related legislation Public authorities are required to make 'complete and accurate records' in accordance with the Public Records Act 2002 (the Act). To help public authorities to achieve this Queensland State Archives developed in 2002, Information Standard 40: Recordkeeping (IS40. This Information Standard aims to foster recordkeeping best practice across the Queensland public sector. The objective of recordkeeping best practice is to establish it as a systematic part of the essential business activities of all public authorities so that records are identified, captured and retained in accessible and usable formats that preserve the evidential integrity of those records for as long as they are required. Queensland State Archives buildings With the appointment of an Archivist in 1959, space was initially allocated in the Commissariat Store in William Street, Brisbane, but this building was full by March 1962. Additional space in the Anzac Square government building and the old Lady Bowen Hospital also filled rapidly. In July 1968 Queensland State Archives was relocated to a purpose-built facility in Dutton Park. Conservation was accorded a new emphasis in the Dutton Park building, with fumigation chambers installed to deal with pest and mould infestation. Stricter environmental controls were placed upon the storage of the records. There was an increase in the number and complexity of reference enquiries and new reprography services were introduced. A microfilm camera was purchased in 1971 and a microfilm storage vault was built. The use of microfilm provided access to heavily used records while preserving the original documents. Space was again an issue by 1974 and in 1978 a building at West End in Brisbane was acquired for use as remote storage. A new building was proposed and a site selected at Runcorn. The current building at Runcorn was built in 1992. Officially opened in 1993, it was nominated for an architectural award and as a finalist received a commendation. Continuing growth in the amount of archival public records led to the construction of a new building adjacent and connected to the existing Queensland State Archives building. The expanded facility opened on 10 November 2008, bringing the total floor area of Queensland State Archives to 23,322m2 and the total storage to approximately 90 linear kilometres. The expansion includes additional repositories which will allow Queensland State Archives to store records transferred from more than 600 Queensland public authorities for the next 10 to 15 years. The new Queensland State Archives building was designed to complement the appearance of the original building and to continue providing a secure, purpose-built environment that will aid in the long-term preservation of Queensland's documentary heritage. The expanded facility project features environmentally sustainable initiatives including water harvesting from roof areas and car park surfaces for re-use in irrigation; recycling of water from cooling tower operations and efficient air-conditioning services, incorporating a purpose-built three million litre chilled water tank for off-peak electricity. Recycled or recyclable materials and fabrics were used in the construction, wherever possible. Access to records Open records held by Queensland State Archives may be viewed onsite in the Public Search Room. Information about the records held can be found using the Queensland State Archives database ArchivesSearch.

It is endemic to western El Dorado County, California, where it grows in the chaparral and woodlands of the Sierra Nevada foothills, such as the Pine Hill Ecological Reserve. It is named after 20th century California flora explorer, botanist, and arboretum director Wayne Roderick. Description This rare shrub is up to about 3 meters wide and flat, forming low brambles or mats. The grayish brown stems root at nodes as they grow horizontally along the ground. The tiny evergreen leaves are oppositely arranged. Each is only about a centimeter long, widely lance-shaped and smooth along the edges or sometimes toothed near the tip. The top surface is green and hairless and the underside is somewhat woolly. The inflorescence is a small cluster of white to pale blue flowers. The fruit is a capsule about half a centimeter long, sometimes bearing small horns on top. Habitat Ceanothus roderickii is found almost exclusively on soils of gabbro origin in the Pine Hill Geological Formation.U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. (2002) Recovery Plan for Gabbro Soil Plants of the Central Sierra Nevada Foothills. Portland, OR. It is a federally listed endangered species. Conservation This endangered plant was first collected in 1956 near Shingle Springs.

It is usually double-barreled, though with the barrels side-by-side rather than vertical as is common in American derringers, and the bores can be rifled or smooth. In Brazil, the most popular chamberings were for the .320 and .380 centrefire cartridges, similar to the .32 S&W; and .38 S&W; in appearance, but conical. They were also chambered for the .22 Short, .22 Long, .22 Long Rifle, and the .32, 8mm, and 9mm Flobert cartridges, among others. These types of pistols were popular from 1930-1960 due to their low cost and small size, and were associated with the gauchos (cowboys) of the South American pampas. In Brazil, Garruchas were produced by Castelo, Rossi, and Lerap.

She was considered the greatest woman pianist of her era, ranked alongside the male keyboard giants of the time. She toured with great success in many parts of the world. She composed a Military March dedicated to Queen Elizabeth, later the Queen Mother; her sister Mathilde's pupil. Life She was born as Adela W√ºrm (that was later anglicised to Verne) into a musical family named W√ºrm. Three of her sisters (of her nine older siblings) were also notable pianists or composers: Mathilde and Alice both also adopted the surname Verne, but Mary returned to Germany, retained the family name W√ºrm, and enjoyed great success as a pianist and composer. Clara Schumann heard Adela play when she was a small girl. She was so impressed that she wanted to take her to Frankfurt for study, as she had done with Mathilde, however her parents would not permit this. Instead, she was taught by Mathilde and Alice, and later by Clara Schumann's daughter Marie Schumann.Verne, Mathilde. Chords of Remembrance (1936), p 102 At age 13 she created a sensation when she played Tchaikovsky's Concerto No.1 in B-flat minor (then a relatively new work), conducted by Sir August Manns at the Crystal Palace. Tchaikovsky himself heard of this astonishing young prodigy and wanted to meet her. The following year she was introduced to Ignacy Jan Paderewski. He was so impressed with her playing that he predicted a great future for her. Later she became close friends with Paderewski, accepted as one of his family, and frequented his home in Morges in Switzerland. She worked on many pieces with him, including Chopin, as well as most of his own works, including the Sonata in E-flat minor, the Polish Fantasy and the Concerto in A minor, the work with which she made her orchestral debut in New York City. Musical career Adela Verne was hailed as the successor to Teresa Carre√±o. She was equally praised by North and South American, Australian, European and British audiences and critics as the greatest living woman pianist, ranked alongside the great male artists of the time. In Vienna, after hearing her play four concertos in one evening, Theodor Leschetizky gave her the rare honour of asking her to give a recital to his own pupils. Her wide repertoire included a large amount from the 18th and 19th centuries, but also much from the 20th century, including works that were very modern for their day. She often appeared in chamber music recitals at the St James's Hall concerts, alongside artists such as the violinist Joseph Joachim and the cellist Alfredo Piatti. She toured Australia with Dame Nellie Melba, and was associated on stage with other singers such as Luisa Tetrazzini, Amelita Galli-Curci and John McCormack, and violinists such as Mischa Elman, Eug√®ne Ysa√øe and others. She appeared regularly at the Proms, and was the first British artist to give a solo recital at the Royal Albert Hall. Her premiere performances were many: she gave the first performance in Australia of Tchaikovsky's B-flat minor Piano Concerto (1898), the first performance in Australia of Saint-Sa√´ns's G minor Piano Concerto (1898), the first performance in the United Kingdom of C√©sar Franck's Symphonic Variations, the first performance at the Prom Concerts of Brahms's B-flat Concerto (and the first woman to play this concerto at all in the UK), and the first television performance of Mozart's Concerto for 2 Pianos (given with her son John Vallier, also a famed concert pianist). At the request of the BBC, in early 1952 she broadcast a special programme of works by Paderewski. Her last public appearance was at the special Jubilee Concerts celebrating the Wigmore Hall. She was preparing for her first recital at London's new Royal Festival Hall, when she died, on 5 February 1952, aged 74. Recorded legacy Adela Verne's recorded legacy is regrettably small. There were two issued discs for English Columbia: * L1212 - Ignacio Cervantes: Three Cuban Dances; Moritz Moszkowski: La Jongleuse (Recorded 1917, matrices 75981‚Äì1, 75983‚Äì1, available from Nov. 1917 to April 1921) * L1213 - Fr√©d√©ric Chopin: Polonaise in A flat, Op. 53 (Recorded 1917, matrices 75979‚Äì2, 75980‚Äì1, available from Dec. 1917 to May 1928) The matrix numbers suggest an unissued recording was made on matrix 75982; she also recorded a number of piano rolls for Aeolian UK, around 1920/1. * 03 - Cervantes: Three Cuban Dances * 42 - Tchaikovsky: Meditation in D, Op. 72, No. 5 * 217 - Felix Mendelssohn: Prelude and Fugue in E minor, Op. 35, No. 1 See also * Alice Verne-Bredt References Further reading * Eric Blom, Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954 * Harold C.

The Dilagrama basically consists of a grenade adapter that fits the barrel of the G3. It is based on the US military's M1A2 Grenade Adapter, a modified M1 Grenade Adapter used with the M26-series Defensive Grenade. The adapter consists of a 3-pronged bracket for holding and securing the grenade (with the lever held down by a breakaway safety tab on the third prong), the tubular body for fitting to the launcher, and the tailfin assembly. The Dilagrama is launched with the use of special blank ammunition. The safety tab holding the grenade's arming lever breaks away when launched, arming the grenade in mid-air. Depending on the range, the grenade will then either air-burst over the target or impact and then detonate. Use in Combat The Dilagrama was developed for the Portuguese Army in the 1960s for use in the Colonial Wars (1961-1974) in their possessions in Africa. Each grupo de combate (Platoon) usually fielded two soldiers armed with Dilagramas.

ESPA was a strong advocate for a 2000 hate crimes law that provided enhanced criminal penalties for crimes motivated by hatred on the basis of sexual orientation. New York Daily News, 7/11/2000 In 2001 and 2002, ESPA worked to ensure that same-sex partners of September 11 attack victims received equal financial assistance, as many same- sex partners of those who perished in the attacks were initially denied any compensation.Mubarak Dahir, \\"Terrorism Aftermath: Sidelined Survivors?

In 2002, the New York State legislature passed Sexual Orientation Non- Discrimination Act (SONDA) with ESPA being the \\"major lobbying muscle\\".Swan, page 107. SONDA was criticized for not covering transgender individuals, but observers felt that the inclusion of gender identity as a protected category would make it impossible to pass the bill (which had first been introduced in 1971).Muscio, pages 257‚Äì8.Sycamore, page 52. In April 2004 Alan Van Capelle was named as the new executive director.\\"News of the Year: April\\", page 24, The Advocate, January 20, 2004.

The 2006 recipients were Merrill Lynch, Kodak, and Kym Ward Gaffney at Price Waterhouse Coopers.\\"Equality at Work Awards\\", page 11, The Advocate, June 6, 2006. ESPA helped pass an August 2004 law guaranteeing same-sex partners hospital visitation rights identical to those enjoyed by spouses and next-of-kin when caring for loved ones in hospitals and other facilities. In October 2004, ESPA held its 13th Annual Fall Dinner with keynote speaker San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom; the Fall Dinner benefited the Empire State Pride Agenda Foundation, which is the non-partisan, 501(c)(3) research, education and advocacy arm of the organization.The Advocate, September 28, 2004, No. 923, page 42, ISSN 0001-8996, Here Publishing The ESPA Foundation, in partnership with the New York State Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Health and Human Services Network, \\"developed and utilized education, advocacy and community organizing strategies to overcome the barriers of political and cultural opposition, inadequate knowledge about the health care needs of the community, and heterocentric models of healthcare\\" to obtain governmental health and wellness funds targeted for LGBT health needs.Healy, page 44. The effort resulted in $10.7 million in state funding for non-HIV/AIDS LGBT service needs, including primary care, preventative health needs, crime victim assistance, and support services for the state and for youth, seniors and people of color.Healy, page 43. In 2005, ESPA helped to pass legislation providing same-sex partners the same authority as spouses when making decisions regarding the burial of a deceased partner. In October 2005, ESPA joined the Lambda Legal Defense Fund and a coalition of anti-censorship groups to oppose a new zoning law that would shut down an estimated 149 adult- oriented bookstores, theaters and clubs including all of the businesses on Christopher Street.During, page 357-8. In 2007, same-sex marriage legislation passed the New York State Assembly by a vote of 85‚Äì61. ESPA has been a leading supporter of same-sex marriage legislation in New York. In 2008, the ESPA- supported Gender Expression Nondiscrimination Act passed the New York State Assembly for the first time. On December 2, 2009, ESPA-supported same-sex marriage legislation failed in the New York State Senate by a vote of 24‚Äì38. On May 14, 2010, a The New York Times blog\\"Gay Rights Group to Choose a New Leader\\", Jeremy W. Peters, \\"City Room\\", The New York Times reported that ESPA was \\"poised to select\\" Brian Ellner as its next executive director. It was later reported that Ellner's past affiliation with Michael Bloomberg had been criticized by some ESPA supporters; for whatever reason, he withdrew his name from consideration,\\"Former Bloomberg Aide to Take On Opponents of Gay Marriage\\", Michael Barbaro, \\"City Room\\", The New York Times and on the 22nd ESPA instead announced appointing Ross D. Levi, an attorney, to the position. Levi had been a legislative assistant at the New York State Legislature starting in 1997 and part of ESPA's Albany staff since before 2000, and since 2006 had held its title as Director of Public Policy & Education.\\"Gay Rights Group Fires Chief, Central in Marriage Fight\\", Kate Taylor, The New York Times, March 6, 2012\\"Ross Levi at Empire State Pride Agenda 2010 Fall Dinner\\", video. On July 2, another reporter reported (on the same NYT blog) Ellner's appointment to head the \\"Campaign for New York Marriage\\", financed by Human Rights Campaign. On April 20, 2011, New Yorkers United for Marriage was instituted as an alliance among ESPA, Marriage Equality New York, the Human Rights Campaign, and Freedom to Marry. A March 6, 2012, report stated\\"Pride Agenda Board Fires Ross Levi\\", Paul Schindler, March 06, 2012, Gay City News that Levi had been \\"fired\\" the preceding day. The Times credited that as the first report, and suggested that ESPA board members felt Human Rights Campaign's work under Ellner had caught attention to the detriment of ESPA's role. Same-sex marriage lobbying At the ESPA Fall Dinner held on October 22, 2009, then-Executive Director Alan Van Capelle publicly expressed great frustration that state senators supported by the group‚Äîsome of whom Van Capelle mentioned by name‚Äîhad not yet passed legislation on same-sex marriage. Gay City News, 12/14.2009 At a \\"couldn't-be-higher stakes\\" November 2010 meeting with Governor David Paterson and other elected officials who supported the same-sex marriage bill, Senate Democratic Leader John Sampson and Senator Jeff Klein \\"did not mince words in letting Van Capelle know they were upset by\\" his critical comments at the Fall Dinner. ESPA was regarded as the driving force behind a failed December 2009 Senate vote on same-sex marriage legislation. The Observer In late 2010, Governor David Paterson was asked what would have to occur in order for same-sex marriage to be legalized in New York. Paterson responded, \\"Get rid of the lobbyists,\\" and added that same-sex marriage lobbyists had \\"literally forced\\" a Senate vote prematurely in December 2009.

It lived in the middle Miocene (specifically in the Laventan land- mammal age), in the \\"Monkey Beds\\" of the Colombian Villavieja Formation. Langstonia was named in 2007 by Alfredo Paolillo and Omar Linares for fossils originally described by Langston in 1965 as Sebecus huilensis. Thus, the type species is L. huilensis.  Discovery and naming  The Tatacoa Desert, in which has been discovered numerous Miocene fossils, including to Langstonia. The first fossils of Langstonia were discovered in the province of Huila in Colombia by the Spanish geologist Jos√© Royo y G√≥mez, during the expeditions in the region by the American paleontologist Robert Stirton. They were found in the area called the Tatacoa Desert at the locality V-4517, characterized by gray claystone overlying sandstone sediments. These have been named the Honda Group, of the La Venta fauna, the geological formation named the \\"lechos de monos\\" (Monkey Beds) in 1945. Many of the remains discovered were then be sent to the collections of the Museum of Paleontology at the University of California, Berkeley (UCMP), where they are still housed. The description of the specimens did not come until 1965, when the American paleontologist Wann Langston Jr. published his monograph Fossil Crocodylians from Colombia, in which he made a detailed analysis of several fossils of crocodylomorphs in Colombia, including the remains of other species as Purussaurus neivensis, Mourasuchus atopus, Gryposuchus colombianus and Charactosuchus fieldsi (plus a possible dyrosaurid) As for the sebecid material he designated the dentary UCMP 37877 as the holotype of a new species a fragmentary taxon, which he called Sebecus huilensis; thus extending the time range of this genus and the family, hitherto known only from remains of the Eocene of Argentina. Langston gave the taxon a new species considering that besides being larger, as the dentary fragment is 68% larger than the Argentine species, S. icaeorhinus, it was also proportionally thinner, and had with more recurved teeth being laterally compressed. Additionally Langston referred a series of zyphodont teeth in the area found this species, with some teeth referred to as similar but classified generally to Sebecus sp., which do not come from the Miocene but the Eocene, found in the department of Santander in Colombia. Subsequently, √âric Buffetaut and Robert Hoffstetter (1977) reported from the Ipururo Formation in the Amazon region of Peru the presence of a huge cranial portion (area of the snout), referring it to this genus, and although its age coincides with S. huilensis, distinguished it through it being larger and more robust. Arthur Busbey (1986) later brought new remains of the species also from the \\"Monkey Beds\\" of Huila in Colombia, this time a fragment of premaxilla, smaller than S. icaeorhinus, and equally thin. He also described the first remains of the jugal bone, the suspensory and retroarticular joint in the jaw, and a fragment of bone scute (osteoderm), which were the earliest known for this family. Busbey also ruled out the Peruvian fossil belonging to S. huilensis, based on its unique anatomy, less spaced teeth and a wider nose. Langston, along with the Argentine paleontologist Zulma Gasparini, reported new remains of the species in a contribution on fossil crocodylomorphs of Colombia for the book Vertebrate Paleontology of the Neotropics: The Miocene Fauna of La Venta (1997). In this case it would be new specimens of teeth, a somewhat fuller premaxilla, an anterior fragment of dentary, and two vertebrae: a sacral and a caudal, which also were unknown to this group. The specimens discovered on this occasion were deposited in the Geological Museum of Ingeominas (previous name of Colombian Geological Service). Moreover, Alfredo Paolillo and Omar Linares described a new genus of a large Venezuelan Miocene sebecid, Barinasuchus of Venezuela. In their article they considered that the traits of two species of Sebecus, S. huilensis and S. querejazus of Paleocene of Bolivia, and their age justified the creation of separate genres for both: S. huilensis was given the genus Langstonia, in honor of its initial descriptor and his \\"(..)advances in knowledge of crocodylians of Tertiary Colombia in particular and South America in general\\", while S. querejazus was renamed Zulmasuchus, although some authors (, and ) still maintain both species within Sebecus. Paolillo and Linares also clarified the status of the Peruvian fossil before assigned to the species, assigning it to Barinasuchus, although this does not rule out its presence in more southern areas; in the area of the Peruvian Amazon known as the Fitzcarrald Arch has been found a characteristically flattened tooth from the middle Miocene therefore assigned to Langstonia. Finally, a premaxilla and maxilla fragment found in Itabora√≠ Basin in Brazil dating from the Middle Paleocene (and where have been found fossils of other sebecids) has been classified as related to this species, under the name of Sebecus cf. huilensis, whose main features are very similar to Langstonia, suggesting that the latter is part of a lineage of sebecids with an extensive temporal and geographical record.  Specimens known  Here is a list of specimens assigned to the species, with a brief description of these. They are grouped according to the institution in which they are preserved:  Museum of Paleontology at the University of California  Not all materials from this collection were assigned to Langstonia huilensis but are included because of their similar morphology. * UCMP 37877: The front part of a right dentary preserving the mandibular symphysis, with six tooth sockets of which five have broken teeth, collected in 1945 in the locality V-4517. This element measures 189.0 millimeters in length, being 68% higher than the rate of Sebecus icaeorhinus specimen. Their teeth are quite compressed and has a first side facing forward tooth, the second is directed upwards and the third also slopes, while others are vertical; the first teeth have a wide separation between them (diastema). Symphysis extending beyond the sixth tooth, while the bone surface is smoother than in S. icaeorhinus. * UCMP 41308: Base of a tooth of the Upper Eocene, from the V-4620 town (Tama fauna, department of Santander, Mugrosa Formation). It measures 14.2 millimeters in diameter at the base. * UCMP 44562: Tooth of the Late Oligocene fauna found in Coyaima, locality V-4411.

Reaches up to 20.5 mm. high, but its base is much wider than other teeth, reaching 23.8 mm. Apart from its size, three times that of the teeth of the holotype of the species, this tooth is characterized by a blunt, relatively straight edges and a more oval profile tranverasal fastened with small saws. It may not correspond to Langstonia. * UCMP 44566: The lower teeth reported by Langston (1965). Recovered in the locality V-4421, measuring just 6.1 mm. wide at the base.  Texas Memorial Museum (TMM)  * TMM 41658-8: Includes a portion of the left anterior premaxillary, middle left maxillary fragment, a fragment of the left splenial bone, back of the left suspensory bone formed by parts of the quadratojugal, the square bone, opisthotic and a squamosal, a left part of a jugal, the left retroarticular processes (partial) right to the jaw and a fragment of an osteoderm. These fragments were recovered in 1976 in the \\"Monkey Pod\\" locality of La Venta (Baraya Member of the Villavieja Formation) by Dr Lundelius Ernest Jr.  Museum of Geology, Colombian Geological Survey (IGM)  * IGM 250816: Found in the Duke 57 locality in Villavieja Formation; consists of a right premaxilla and part of the maxilla, the front left tooth, part of the dorsal border of a rostrum and two vertebrae. The premaxillary measured 12.8 cm in length, is tall and thin compared to the S. icaeorhinus being covered with fine grooves on its outer surface. It has three dental alveoli in the premaxilla, from the edge of the second tooth to the fourth, which is particularly enlarged, being twice the third (reverse that in S. icaeorhinus), while the first two teeth should be small. After the fourth premaxillary tooth there is a space or diastema in that fitted the fourth lower tooth that exceeded the 3.5 centimeters; has a narrow palate, lateral nasal aperture and without mild depression around. The dentary is high, with four sockets, two projecting forward and a third and fourth straight, the latter being the largest. The associated vertebrae are an amphycoelian sacral with a sacral rib attached, with a wide, rectangular neural spine; it measured 10.7 cm high by 5.5 cm wide, while it is estimated that the sacral ribs should be 10 cm wide at its rear end. The other is an anterior caudal vertebrae, perhaps the first, with incomplete neural spine, with a broad neural canal, and measures 2.8 cm wide and 2.1 high. * IGM 184 427: A tooth found in the Duke 91 locality. The crown of this is twice as high as it is wide, reaching 36 mm. high and 17 wide. * IGM 250 541: Tooth from the Duke 196 locality, is incomplete and worn, but is similar to the tooth UCMP 40186. It measures 39 mm high by 27 wide. * IGM 250 427: A tooth of the Duke 106 locality. It is also incomplete, but its measurements (52 mm high by 30 mm wide) makes it the largest tooth reported for a sebecosuchian in Colombia. * IGM 184378: Tooth from Duke 40 locality.

Unlike other teeth of L. huilensis, has a slight groove at the base of the tooth crown, on the inner side thereof.  Department of Vertebrate Paleontology, Museum of Natural History, Universidad de San Marcos  * MUSM 912: A single tooth found in the area of Fitzcarrald Arch in the localities of Inuya and Mapuya in the Amazon region of Peru; its size and shape are indistinguishable from L. huilensis.  Museu de Ci√™ncias da Terra, Rio de Janeiro  * MCT 1795-R/1796-R: consists of material of sebecid found in Itabora√≠ Basin in the state of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. Includes a full left premaxilla with a tooth preserved, and a piece of left maxilla with two alveoli. By having very flattened and spaced teeth looks remarkably similar to Langstonia, being provisionally classified as Sebecus cf. huilensis.  Paleobiology  Life reconstruction of Langstonia Due to the fragmentary remains generally known for this family, its possible only describe some general aspects of the appearance and biology of Langstonia. As mentioned above, the fossil type of the species is larger than Sebecus icaeorhinus with jaws and teeth even more flattened, although its general proportions are reminiscent of this species, which suggests that their skull would be higher and laterally flattened, in contrast to modern crocodilians, which generally have a horizontally flattened skull with conical teeth. Teeth are of the zyphodont kind, with very flattened sides, slightly curved back and with serrated edges with small denticles (between 5-6 denticles per millimeter in the teeth of this genus) and also without any grooves on its surface. This type of teeth appears in the close relatives of sebecids, the peirosaurids and baurusuchids of the Cretaceous and some crocodilians of the Cenozoic as the pristichampsids and some mekosuchines. These forms were land animals that used their teeth to cut and tear their prey, because the traditional method of capture of the crocodiles, using its pressure force to retain and drown his victims is not viable on land; these crocodylomorphs also had more elongated limbs, stiff back, ideal to hold the weight and give strength to run. Langston had already suggested that these teeth were indicative that this animal had more terrestrial habits than those of existing species and the Miocene contemporary crocodylians, and in the modern world only could be vaguely compared with the less aquatic habits of the caimans of the genus Paleosuchus, which have a higher muzzle and a higher degree of ossification around the eye socket, so that they partially resemble sebecids. Busbey suggested the fact that his skull was high implied that these animals seek not to make pressure during the bite indefinitely, but to produce cuts then back quickly so that the bleeding weakens their prey slowly up to devour, similar to what has been thought to be the case for the extant Komodo dragon, thereby adopting a strategy of stalking in areas where prey transit frequently. Since in the fauna of La Venta, although there were some large mammalian predators (sparassodonts, Lycopsis longirostrus and Dukecynus), neither of them equated in size to the contemporary crocodylomorphs, , and given the absence of large predatory birds phorusrhacids as in the southern part of the continent, these sebecids were probably the terrestrial apex predators in its ecosystem. The fossils found of other species - big fishes, manatees, large browsing meridiungulates as Granastrapotherium and Huilatherium, and some grazers as Pericotoxodon - indicate that the climate was warm and humid with heavy rainfall and with droughts periods no extending beyond 3‚Äì4 months, consisting of watersheds, forests and certain adjacent areas of open grasslands where it could hunt down a large variety of megafauna. The disappearance of the system of large rivers of the Amazon lake system and the gradual uplift of the Andes caused major ecological changes in South America in the mid-Miocene. The last sebecids, Langstonia and Barinasuchus were likely apex predators in their environment, and as an effect they would be particularly susceptible to ecological changes that caused other lineages, particularly hoofed mammals (such as groups Astrapotheria, Leontiniidae, Adianthidae and Notohippidae) to die out, thus leading to extinction to the last notosuchians crocodilomorphs of the world.  Phylogeny  Langstonia is considered part of Sebecosuchia, a lineage of ziphodont terrestrial crocodylomorphs forming part of a separate lineage of the southern continent of Gondwana. As noted earlier, this species formerly part of the genus Sebecus and phylogenetic analyzes have consistently shown that these forms a clade within Sebecidae next to S. icaeorhinus and Zulmasuchus, not so closely related to Barinasuchus and Bretesuchus.

The 13th Olympic Congress was held between 3‚Äì5 October 2009 in Copenhagen, Denmark, by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It was held together with the meetings of the Executive Board and the 121st IOC Session. History Convened on the initiative of President Jacques Rogge, the 13th Olympic Congress brought together all the constituent parties of the Olympic Movement to study and discuss the current functioning of the Movement and define the main development axes for the future. \\"This will be an important milestone and a chance for the entire Olympic family to discuss and debate some major issues around the role of the Olympic Movement in society. How can we use digital technologies to communicate the values of Olympism? How do we better connect with young people? What can we all do to encourage people to lead active, healthy lifestyles? These are just some of the questions we will grapple with at the Congress. Getting at some answers won't be easy, but is very necessary.\\" said Jacques Rogge. President Rogge underlined in his short address the role sport and the Olympic Movement play in society. \\"Sport has played, plays and will always play, an important role worldwide.\\" According to Rogge, the IOC and all other members of the Olympic Movement will seize the opportunity of the 13th Congress in Copenhagen to demonstrate what has already been achieved in this field, that the Movement is committed to fully playing its role and that it is taking up every challenge in order to set the bar even higher. The 13th Olympic Congress was held from 3 to 5 October 2009 in the Danish capital. It brought together around 1,000 participants representing: IOC members; IOC honorary and honour members; representatives of the International Federations, National Olympic Committees, the athletes and Organising Committees for the Olympic Games; athletes and athlete support staff (coaches, doctors and medical staff); referees, judges and technical officials; the IOC‚Äôs Olympic partners; and the media. The various stages of the Olympic Congress run from 1 July 2007 until the end of 2009. The meetings in Copenhagen will mark the culmination of this process. But even then, the work will not be finished, as the next task will be to implement the main Congress recommendations that the Session has accepted. The first meeting of the 2009 Congress Commission, which is chaired by President Rogge, and includes the entire membership of the EB, met for the first time this morning to start the process that will lead to the 13th Olympic Congress in Copenhagen in October 2009. The 13th Olympic Congress will include a public consultation for the first time in the history of Olympic congresses. The Chairman of the Congress Organising Committee and President of the National Olympic Committee of Denmark, IOC member Kai Holm, is convinced that the Olympic Congress will strengthen Denmark's ties with the sports world, especially the various International Federations and the National Olympic Committees around the world. \\"Such an opening allows us to exchange points of view, learn from each other and establish contacts which will be valuable for years to come\\", he believes. Through this consultation, a list of sixty-six recommendations to strength and improve the Olympic Movement was published. The city of Copenhagen was chosen on 8 February by the 118th IOC Session held in Turin, Italy. The other candidates were Athens (Greece), Busan (South Korea), Cairo (Egypt), Riga (Latvia), Singapore (Singapore), and Taipei (Chinese Taipei).

Technical peer reviews are a well defined review process for finding and fixing defects, conducted by a team of peers with assigned roles. Technical peer reviews are carried out by peers representing areas of life cycle affected by material being reviewed (usually limited to 6 or fewer people). Technical peer reviews are held within development phases, between milestone reviews, on completed products or completed portions of products. A technical peer review may also be called an engineering peer review, a product peer review, a peer review/inspection or an inspection.  Overview  The purpose of technical peer reviews is to remove defects as early as possible in the development process. By removing defects at their origin (e.g., requirements and design documents, test plans and procedures, software code, etc.), technical peer reviews prevent defects from propagating through multiple phases and work products, and reduce the overall amount of rework necessary on projects. In addition, improved team efficiency is a side effect of technical peer reviews (e.g., by improving team communication, integrating the viewpoints of various engineering specialty disciplines, more quickly bringing new members up to speed, and educating project members about effective development practices). In CMMI, peer reviews are used as a principal means of verification in the Verification process area and as an objective evaluation method in the Process and Product Quality Assurance process area. The results of technical peer reviews can be reported at milestone reviews. (See Milestone (project management).) Roles of participants ;Moderator Responsible for conducting the technical peer review process and collecting inspection data. Plays key role in all stages of the technical peer review process except rework. Required to perform several duties during a technical peer review in addition to inspector‚Äôs tasks. ;Inspectors Responsible for finding defects in work product from a general point of view, as well as defects that affect their area of expertise. ;Author Provides information about work product during all stages of process. Responsible for correcting all major defects and any minor and trivial defects that cost and schedule permit. Performs duties of an inspector. ;Reader Guides team through work product during the technical peer review meeting. Reads or paraphrases work product in detail. Performs duties of an inspector in addition to reader‚Äôs role. ;Recorder Accurately records each defect found during inspection meeting on the Inspection Defect List. Performs duties of an inspector in addition to recorder‚Äôs role.  Vested interest of reviewers  There are two philosophies about the vested interest of the inspectors in the product under review. On one hand, project personnel who have a vested interest in the work product under review have the most knowledge of the product and are motivated to find and fix defects. On the other hand, personnel from outside the project who do not have a vested interest in the work product bring objectivity and a fresh viewpoint to the technical peer review team. Each inspector is invited to disclose vested interests to the rest of the technical peer review panel so the Moderator can exercise sound judgement in evaluating the inspector's inputs.  Distinction from other types of technical review  Peer reviews are distinct from management reviews, which are conducted by management representatives rather than by colleagues, and for management and control purposes rather than for technical evaluation. They are also distinct from software audit reviews, which are conducted by personnel external to the project, to evaluate compliance with specifications, standards, contractual agreements, or other criteria. A software peer review is a type of technical peer review. The IEEE defines formal structures, roles, and processes for software peer reviews.IEEE Std. 1028-1997, \\"IEEE Standard for Software Reviews\\"  Management involvement  Management representatives are typically not involved in the conduct of a peer review. This is especially true of line managers of the author or other participants in the review. A policy of encouraging management to stay out of peer reviews encourages the peer review team to concentrate on the product being reviewed and not on the people or personalities involved.

John Savage, Earl Rivers, declared for the royalist side during the Civil War; Rocksavage was ransacked by parliamentarian forces, and the roof and part of the walls were destroyed. The first Duke of Monmouth stayed at Rocksavage on 13 September 1682 as a guest of Thomas Savage, Earl Rivers, while touring Cheshire to assess support for a faction opposed to Charles II.Hodson, p. 11 The estate passed by marriage to James Barry, Earl of Barrymore in the early 18th century.Hodson, p. 79 Further buildings were constructed higher up the hill by Lord Barrymore, possibly by the architect Henry Sephton. Now known as Clifton Hall, these might have been intended as a replacement for Rocksavage or as service buildings for the main mansion. A few years after these buildings were erected, Rocksavage was abandoned after the 4th earl's daughter and heiress, Lady Penelope Barry, married into the Cholmondeley family and the principal seat of the combined estate became Cholmondeley House;Robinson, John Martin (1991).

Brereton Hall, built some twenty years later by Sir John Savage's ward and son-in-law Sir William Brereton, was modelled on Rocksavage and copied its paired octagonal towers. Unlike Brereton Hall, the string courses of the Rocksavage towers extended around the adjoining walls. The last major remnant of the house fell in around 1980. Only the orchard gateposts and fragments of garden and orchard walls now remain near the Weaver Viaduct over the M56 in Runcorn; they are designated by National Heritage as a Grade II- listed building. The 18th-century Clifton Hall was originally a U-shaped brick building with prominent stone pilasters. One arm of the U has been demolished and the remnants are now surrounded by farm buildings.

It is an ASI protected Monument of National Importance in Goa.  History  Mahadeva Temple sign, Archaeological Survey of India The temple is built in the Kadamba style from basalt, carried across the mountains from the Deccan plateau and carved by craftsmen. It is considered to be the only specimen of Kadamba architecture in basalt stone preserved and available in Goa. The temple survived invasions and the Goa Inquisition due to its remote location in a clearing deep in the forest at the foot of the Western Ghats which surround the site. Mahadev Temple, Tambdi Surla  Religious significance and decoration  The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is reminiscent of the temples at Aihole in neighbouring Karnataka. There is a linga (symbol of Lord Shiva) mounted on a pedestal inside the inner sanctum, and local legend has it that a huge king cobra is in permanent residence in the dimly lit interior. The temple consists of garbhagriha, antarala and a pillared Nandi mandapa built of basalt. The four pillars, embellished with intricate carvings of elephants and chains support a stone ceiling decorated with finely carved Ashtoken lotus flowers.Archaeological Survey of India, sign at locationMahadev Temple, Tambdi Surla The intricate carvings created by skilled craftsmen adorn the interior and the sides of the building.

There is a small mandap and the inner sanctum is surmounted by a three-tired tower whose top is incomplete or has been dismantled sometime in the distant past. There is a headless Nandi (bull, Shiva's vehicle) in the centre of the mandap, surrounded by four matching columns. The symbol of the Kadamba kingdom, an elephant trampling a horse is carved on the base of one of the columns. The river Ragado, (via village Keri, Sattari) flows nearby and is reachable for ritual bathing by a flight of stone steps. The festival of Mahashivratri is celebrated with pomp and gaiety at the temple by local people residing in surrounding villages. The temple is built in a place which is quite inaccessible and away from the main settlements of the time. The temple is small compared to the average Goan temple.  Location  Map of Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park, showing Tambdi Surla The temple is at near a small village called Tambdi Surla located east of Bolcornem village, in the north east region of the Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park.

There is nothing trivial about his music; he is, to quote an often used phrase, a 'musician's musician.'\\" The Allmusic review by Stephen Cook states that the album \\"qualifies as one of the pianist's most enjoyable early discs\\". Reviewing the album in 2017, Marc Myers of JazzWax said: \\"For some strange reason, in late 1962 and the first half of 1963, Tyner was asked by producer Bob Thiele to record more straightforward jazz albums as a leader... Tyner's playing is exciting and exceptional on all of the tracks... On the album, he exhibits a reserved elegance and tenderness that reveals the other side of his personality‚Äîa lover of melody and standards. In this regard, there are traces of Oscar Peterson in his playing. Perhaps Thiele was using Tyner to take a bite out of Peterson's vast and successful early-'60s share of the jazz market.\\"  Track listing  # \\"Satin Doll\\" (Ellington, Mercer, Strayhorn) - 5:40 # \\"We'll Be Together Again\\" (Fischer, Laine) - 3:40 # \\"'Round Midnight\\" (Monk) - 6:23 # \\"For Heaven's Sake\\" (Elise Bretton, Edwards, Donald Meyer) - 3:48 # \\"Star Eyes\\" (De Paul, Raye) - 5:03 # \\"Blue Monk\\" (Monk) - 5:22 # \\"Groove Waltz\\" (Tyner) - 5:31 # \\"Days of Wine and Roses\\" (Mancini, Mercer) - 3:21  Personnel  * McCoy Tyner - piano * Steve Davis - double bass * Lex Humphries - drums  References  Category:1963 albums Category:McCoy Tyner albums Category:albums produced by Bob Thiele Category:Impulse!

The first all-acoustic album released by Circus Devils, Gringo is a song cycle in which each track recounts a moment in the life of a nameless drifter known only as \\"the Gringo.\\" The moods on the album range widely between jubilant to melancholy to mean.  Reaction  Musically the album is filled with creepy film-score interludes and art-rock grinders, but also pretty and strange acoustic balladry. Like every Circus Devils album, it feels haunted, but those ghosts do less screaming and more gentle creeping and following. And of course, nothing is as it seems.

In January 2001, IFPI Hong Kong had considered for a music award that would have similar categories to American Grammy Awards and British Brit Awards, but the event has yet to be held as of 2014. The Four Major Awards Each year Hong Kong's four main media outlets; RTHK, TVB, CRHK, and Metro Radio; hold their own music award ceremonies. These are the four music awards that are given the most attention by the media, fans, and record companies. Metro Radio Music Awards Metro Radio's music awards (Êñ∞ÂüéÂãÅÁàÜÈ†íÁçéÁ¶Æ) is usually the first of the four major music award ceremonies and is considered \\"music's first report card\\". The awards ceremony always takes place on December 26th, Boxing Day. Metro Radio is known for giving out the most number of awards, with the number of awards increasing almost every year. In 2000 they gave out 53 awards, but in 2008 they gave out 137 awards. The awards have been held at number of different venues throughout the years. In recent years they have been held at HKCEC Hall 3, but in 2008, it moved to the newly opened AsiaWorld Arena. Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation CRHK's music awards (Âè±Âí§Ê®ÇÂ£áÊµÅË°åÊ¶ú) is usually the second major music awards ceremony of the year. Awards are determined by airplay on CRHK's FM 90.3 CR2 (based on spins). Spins for songs are only counted if they chart for that particular week (meaning if they make it on the station's weekly Top 20 chart). The awards ceremony are held on January 1st, New Year's Day, every year. The awards have been held at number of different venues throughout the years including the Hong Kong Coliseum and Hong Kong Stadium. In recent years, they have been held at HKCEC Hall 3, but in 2007, like Metro Radio Music Awards, the award was held at AsiaWorld Arena instead. The only awards that are not determined by airplay are the four \\"My Favourite\\" awards, which are determined by votes from the public. The process in which votes are collected have changed throughout the years. Currently, the \\"My Favourite Male, Female, and Group\\" awards are determined by an official poll online. For the first round of voting, fans get to choose from a large list of nominees. The five artists with the most scores are then picked from the long list of nominees, and then the public gets to choose from the top 5 for the second round of voting. The top 5 nominees for the \\"My Favourite Song\\" award is also collected through online votes, but then for the final round votes are collected and counted on site at the awards ceremony. Due to the fact that CRHK's award ceremonies are determined by airplay, netizens compile the songs played on the station everyday. The play counts are then posted on a number of online discussion forums and web sites. While the actual outcome is usually similar to what is compiled by fans online, there are always some differences. But CRHK claims that this is only because the radio station calculate airplay differently from fans. Jade Solid Gold Top Ten Songs Music Awards Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards Presentation, presented by TVB, is usually the third of the four major music awards held every year. The awards ceremony is generally held in early to mid January. Even though CRHK's music awards are generally given the most hype and attention, while in recent years, TVB's method of determining the winners have been questioned by fans, TVB's \\"Most Popular Male/Female\\" and \\"Gold Song Gold\\" awards are still seen as some of the most prestigious music awards in Hong Kong. The awards ceremony was held at the Hong Kong Coliseum annually, except for the 2008 edition which was held at Star Hall. Since 2011, the award's venue was moved to TVB City. RTHK's Top Ten Chinese Songs Music Awards RTHK's music awards is usually the last of the four major Hong Kong music awards. The awards ceremony has the longest history out of four major awards, and thus, is one of the most prestigious, giving out its first award in 1978. The awards ceremony gives out a number of big awards every year including the Top 10 Golden songs, the Nation's most favourite male and females, and, most importantly, its Golden Song Award. To qualify for a Top 10 Golden Song award, a song must finish in the top 3 in RTHK's Radio 2 Weekly Countdown which ranks the most popular songs every week. Fans and critics alike both vote for their favourite songs and artists right before the ceremony to determine which awards are given to whom. Its \\"Golden Needle\\" award is generally seen as the most prestigious lifetime achievement award in the Hong Kong music industry. A list of past RTHK Awards can be found here: RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards. Since RTHK is the last of the four ceremonies, it is also the ceremony that awards the 4 Stations Joint Music Awards. Four Stations Joint Music Awards Every year, Hong Kong's four major media outlets also give out four \\"joint awards\\" given out by all four stations. *Outstanding Achievement Award :*Criteria: Artists are given points based on their chart performance at all four media stations. An artist is given 1 point if his/her/their song places 10th on a song chart, 2 points if it places 9th, 3 points if it places 8th, and so on. The top three artists that accumulate the most points are then given Gold, Silver, and Bronze awards. Only artists that have debuted within the last three years are considered for the award. *Album Award :*Criteria: Awards are determined based on the same point system used for the \\"Outstanding Achievement Award\\". The award is given to the album that accumulates the most points from its radio singles (also known as \\"plugs\\" in Hong Kong). The award is given to the artist and producer(s) of the album. *Song Award :*Criteria: Awards are determined based on the same point system as the previous two awards. The award is given to the song that accumulates the most points from all four stations. It is awarded to the composer, lyricist, and artist of the song. *Media Award :*Criteria: The award is given to the artist, composer, and lyricist that wins the most awards at the four major music awards. Therefore it is always awarded at the last of the four major awards ceremonies. Special awards such as TVB's \\"Charity Award\\" are not counted though. Other award ceremonies * CASH Golden Sail Music Awards The only music awards based purely on quality, these awards are given by the \\"Composers and Authors Society of Hong Kong Ltd.\\" * IFPI Music Sales Awards These awards are given out by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. The awards are usually based on album sales of both local and international music, but after four major record labels withdrew from IFPI in August 2008, almost all of the awards are given to local record companies. * Roadshow Music Awards This award ceremony is organized by Hong Kong outdoor media provider RoadShow. Since 2006, it has been held in January of each year. It has been suspended since 2009.

Working class district of the Edo period (Fukagawa Edo Museum). Working-class district apartments (Fukagawa Edo Museum). Edo society refers to the society of Japan under the rule of the Tokugawa Shogunate during the Edo period from 1603 to 1868. Edo society was a feudal society with strict social stratification, customs, and regulations intended to promote political stability. Japanese people were assigned into a hierarchy of social classes based on the Four Occupations that were hereditary. The Emperor of Japan and the kuge were the official ruling class of Japan but had no power. The Sh≈çgun of the Tokugawa clan, the daimy≈ç, and their retainers of the samurai class administered Japan through their system of domains. Majority of Edo society were commoners divided into peasant, craftsmen, and merchant classes, and various \\"untouchable\\" groups. The Bakumatsu from 1853 led to growing opposition to the Edo system and it was dismantled after the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Historic context Feudalism, social stratification, and explicit fine grained ranking of people existed in Japan long before the Edo period, beginning with attempts as far back as the Taika Reforms in 645 A.D., initiating the Ritsury≈ç legal system that was modeled from Chinese Tang dynasty legal code. The reforms were following a major and devastating coup d'etat attempt by Soga no Emishi, with the events not only exterminating entire clans, but tearing apart a gaping hole in the Japanese indigenous religion, Ko-Shint≈ç, paving the way for a Buddhist-Shinto syncretism of religion. The Taika Reforms were the \\"legal glue\\" deemed necessary to thwart future coup d'etat attempts, and the Ritsury≈ç system led to the formation of castes in Japan. Nevertheless, frequent warfare and political instability plagued Japan in following centuries, providing countless opportunities to usurp, bend, and mobilize positions within social ranks. Even the ranks themselves, especially military ranks, became more respected if only out of necessity. Confucian ideas from China also provided the foundation for a system of strict social prescriptions, along with political twists and turns of the day. The Ashikaga Shogunate established a loose class system when it ruled Japan as a feudal shogunate during the Muromachi period from 1338 to 1573. The final collapse of the Ashikaga worsened the effects of the Sengoku period (or \\"Age of Warring States\\"), the state of social upheaval and near- constant civil war in Japan since 1467. Tokugawa Ieyasu of the Tokugawa clan and his Eastern Army emerged victorious after the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, defeating the Western Army of Toyotomi Hideyori, ending the Sengoku civil wars. Ieyasu founded the Tokugawa Shogunate as a new feudal government of Japan with himself as the Sh≈çgun. However, Ieyasu was especially wary of social mobility given that Toyotomi Hideyoshi, one of his peers and a Kampaku (Imperial Regent) whom he replaced, was born into a low caste and rose to become Japan's most powerful political figure of the time. The Tokugawa clan sought to eradicate any potential opposition across Japanese society from top- to-bottom to consolidate their rule. Tokugawa class system The Tokugawa introduced a system of strict social stratification, organizing the majority of Japan's social structure into a hierarchy of social classes. Japanese people were assigned a hereditary class based on their profession, which would be directly inherited by their children, and these classes were themselves stratified with their own hierarchies.  Aristocracy  =Emperor= The Emperor of Japan was the official ruler of Japan at the very top of the Tokugawa class hierarchy. However, the Emperor was only a de jure ruler, functioning as a figurehead held up as the ultimate source of political sanction for the Sh≈çgun's authority. The Emperor and his Imperial Court located in Kyoto, the official capital of Japan, were given virtually no political power but their prestige was invincible. =Court nobility= The Court nobility, the kuge, were the civil aristocracy of Japan and second on the Tokugawa class hierarchy. Similar to the Emperor, the kuge were incredibly prestigious and held significant influence in cultural fields, but wielded very little political power and served functions only for symbolic purposes. =Sh≈çgun= The Sh≈çgun was the de facto ruler of Japan and third on the Tokugawa class hierarchy. Officially, the Sh≈çgun was a title for a prominent military general of the samurai class appointed by the Emperor with the task of national administration. In reality, the Sh≈çgun was a military dictator with only nominal appointment from the Emperor who held the ultimate political power in Japan, controlling foreign policy, the military, and feudal patronage. The Sh≈çgun was a hereditary position held by members of the Tokugawa clan who were direct descendants of Tokugawa Ieyasu. The Sh≈çgun was based in the Tokugawa capital city of Edo, Musashi Province, located 370 kilometers east of Kyoto in the Kanto region, and ruled Japan with his government, the Bakufu. =Daimy≈ç= Model of the castle and city of Kumamoto in the Edo period. The daimy≈ç were samurai feudal lords and fourth on the Tokugawa class hierarchy. The daimy≈ç were high-ranking members of the samurai and, similar to the Sh≈çgun, held most of the real political power in Japan. The daimy≈ç were responsible for administration through their large personal domains, the han, which served as unofficial administrative divisions in tandem with the legal provinces. A daimy≈ç was determined if a samurai's domain was assessed at 10,000 koku (50,000 bushels) or more under the Tokugawa Kokudaka system of taxation. The daimy≈ç held significant autonomy but the Tokugawa policy of Sankin-k≈çtai required them to alternate living in Edo and their domain every year. The daimy≈ç were separated into the Shinpan, relatives of the Tokugawa, the Fudai daimy≈ç, who filled the ranks of the Tokugawa administration, and the Tozama daimy≈ç, those who only submitted to the Tokugawa after the Battle of Sekigahara. Four Classes The four classes of society in Japan during the Edo period by Ozawa Nankoku. The Tokugawa government intentionally created a social order called the Four divisions of society (shin≈çk≈çsh≈ç) that would stabilize the country. The new Four Classes were based on ideas of Confucianism that spread to Japan from China, and were not arranged by wealth or capital but by what philosophers described as their moral purity. By this system, the non-aristocratic remainder of Japanese society was composed of samurai (Â£´ shi), farming peasants (Ëæ≤ n≈ç), artisans (Â∑• k≈ç) and merchants (ÂïÜ sh≈ç). Samurai were placed at the top of society because they started an order and set a high moral example for others to follow. The system was meant to reinforce their position of power in society by justifying their ruling status. However, the shin≈çk≈çsh≈ç does not accurately describe Tokugawa society as Buddhist and Shinto priests, the kuge outside of the Imperial Court, and outcast classes were not included in this description of hierarchy. In some cases, a poor samurai could be little better off than a peasant and the lines between the classes could blur, especially between artisans and merchants in urban areas. Still, the theory provided grounds for restricting privileges and responsibilities to different classes and it gave a sense of order to society. In practice, solidified social relationships in general helped create the political stability that defined the Edo period. =Samurai= Samurai were the noble [warrior] class in Japan and fifth on the Tokugawa class hierarchy. The samurai constituted about 7‚Äì8% of the population and functioned as soldiers in the employment of a lord in a master- warrior feudal relationship. Other classes were prohibited from possessing long swords such as the tachi or katana, and carrying both a long sword and a short sword became the symbol of the samurai class. However, their services were in limited demand as the Edo period was largely free from both external threats and internal conflicts. Instead, the samurai maintained their fighting skills more as an art form than to fight. Samurai were paid a stipend from their lord, limiting their ties to the economic base. In addition, samurai could not own land, which would have given them income independent from their duty. Samurai generally lived around their daimy≈çs castle, creating a thriving town or city environment around the middle of a domain. There were social stratifications within the samurai class: upper-level samurai had direct access to their daimy≈ç and could hold his most trusted positions, with some achieving a level of wealth that allowed them to retain their own samurai vassals. Mid-level samurai held military and bureaucratic positions, and had some interactions with their daimy≈ç if needed. Low-level samurai could be paid as little as a subsistence wage and worked as guards, messengers and clerks. Positions within the samurai class were largely hereditary and talented individuals could not rise above a few social steps beyond their birth. =Peasants= Peasants (heimin) were sixth on the Tokugawa class hierarchy and first of the commoner classes. Peasants were held in high regard as commoners by the Tokugawa because they produced the most important commodity, food. According to Confucian philosophy, society could not survive without agriculture. Life for rural peasants focused on farming in and around their villages. Peasants rarely moved beyond their villages, and journeys and pilgrimages required a permit, but young people occasionally sought seasonal employment outside of their village. As a result, people were highly suspicious of outsiders. Social bonding, critical to the survival of the whole village, also reinforced through seasonal festivals. Villages were highly collective; there were strong pressures to conform and no room to deviate from custom. Though there were conflicts, they were seen as disruptive to the village and order and were to be limited as much as possible. The peasant class owned land, but rights to tax this land were given to the local daimy≈ç. Peasants worked to produce enough food for themselves and still meet the tax burden. Most agriculture during this time was cultivated by families on their own land in contrast to the plantation or hacienda model implemented elsewhere. Peasants could amass relatively large amounts of wealth but remained in the same class because of their association with the land. Wealthier families and those that held their own land and paid taxes were held in much higher regard and had more political influence in village matters. However, the survival of the village depended on every household cooperating to meet the tax burden and overcome natural disasters such as famines. During the reign of the third Sh≈çgun, Tokugawa Iemitsu, farmers were not allowed to eat any of the rice they grew. They had to hand it all over to their daimyo and then wait for him to give some back as charity. =Artisans= Merchant's house (Fukagawa Edo Museum) Artisans were seventh on the Tokugawa class hierarchy and second of the commoner classes. Artisans were placed below the peasants because they were producers but they produced non-essential goods. Artisans typically lived in urban areas, and by 1800, as much as 10% of the population of Japan may have lived in large urban areas, one of the highest levels in the world at the time. The daimy≈çs and their samurai did not produce any goods themselves, but they used the tax surplus from the land to fuel their consumption. Their needs were met by artisans, who moved to be around the castles and were restricted to living in their own quarter. =Merchants= Merchant's kitchen; stove boiler made of copper (Fukagawa Edo Museum) Merchants were eighth on the Tokugawa class hierarchy and third of the commoner classes. Merchants were placed at the very bottom of the official system because they did not produce any goods, and due to their low status, were forced to hustle trading local and regional goods. Merchants, similar to artisans, typically lived in cities within their own quarter. Merchants grew increasingly powerful during the Edo period, in spite of their social standing, and the top merchants commanded a certain amount of respect, with Osaka and later Edo having concentrations of the merchant class. Wealthy merchant houses arose to organize distributors and hold legal monopolies. As their wealth grew, merchants wanted to consume and display their wealth in the same manner as the samurai, but laws prevented them from doing so overtly. Still, their consumption combined with that of the samurai served to reinforce the growth of the merchant and artisan classes. Untouchables Underneath the merchant class were various communities and levels of outcasts not included within the official Tokugawa class system. These people were \\"untouchables\\" who fell outside of mainstream Japanese society for one reason or another, and were actively discriminated against at the societal level. =Burakumin= The Burakumin (\\"hamlet people\\"/\\"village people\\" or \\"those who live in hamlets/villages\\") were ethnic Japanese people whose occupations were considered impure or tainted by death, such as executioners, undertakers, slaughterhouse workers, butchers, and tanners. These occupations were seen to be kegare (Á©¢„Çå or \\"defilement\\") in the Shinto religion; and, in the Edo period, the social stigma of being a Burakumin developed into a hereditary status. Although technically commoners, the Burakumin were victim of severe ostracism and lived in their own isolated villages or ghettos away from the rest of the population. =Ethnic minorities= Ethnic minorities in Japan were generally excluded from the class system, though certain individuals in service of the Sh≈çgun or daimy≈ç were included. The Tokugawa isolationist policy of Sakoku banned most foreigners from entering Japan. Role of women A Japanese woman's life varied immensely according to her family's social status. Women in samurai families were expected to submit to their male heads of household, but as they aged, they could become the ranking household member if their husband died. Children were enjoined to respect both of their parents, even as adults. Women from the lower classes were much less restricted by social expectations and could play an integral part in the family's business. Peasant women were expected to do household chores in the early morning before working in the fields with their male relatives and, regardless of age, were important, working members of their families. Marriage was not based on romantic attraction. Families tried to use marriage as a way to increase their social standing or, among wealthier groups, to increase one's influence and holdings. Most often, however, marriage occurred between two families of equal status. Female virginity at marriage was important in the samurai classes; it was much less important to the lower classes. After marriage, women were restricted from taking additional sexual partners. Males of the upper classes, however, were able to take concubines and have relations with unmarried women. Divorce was common, and a woman from a poor household could very easily leave her husband and return to her original family. Decline The foundation of Edo society was its stable social order, but changes to Japanese society over the next two centuries began to challenge the Tokugawa system. Increasing urbanization and rising consumerism saw wealth become concentrated outside of the samurai class, and their fixed stipends did not increase despite the rising cost of commodities. The increasingly burdensome cost of proper social etiquette led many samurai to become indebted to wealthy urban merchant families. The merchants, in turn, were restricted from showing their wealth for fear of violating the laws that restricted privileges to the samurai class. That created deepening resentment but also increasing interdependence between the two classes. Some Japanese scholars began to question the Confucian beliefs that provided the foundation of Edo society. Additionally, numerous changes in rural areas increasingly challenged the Tokugawa system. New technology which increased productivity allowed some peasant families to produce a surplus of food, creating a disposable income that could be used to support ventures beyond farming. Some peasants also became indebted to their wealthier neighbors, and more families lost ownership of their land. This sparked resentment that sometimes erupted into violence towards landlords and the village elite. In 1853, the beginning of the Bakumatsu saw Edo society increasingly questioned by Japanese people when Western powers used their technological superiority to force concessions from the Tokugawa in the Unequal treaties. Many Japanese people, including members of the samurai, began to blame the Tokugawa for Japan's \\"backwardness\\" and subsequent humiliation. A modernization movement which advocated the abolition of feudalism and return of power to the Imperial Court eventually overthrew the Tokugawa Shogunate in the Meiji Restoration in 1868. The new Meiji government of the Empire of Japan soon abolished the Tokugawa class system that characterized Edo society. The kuge and daimyo classes were merged into the kazoku aristocratic class with class privileges which formed the Meiji oligarchy. Most remaining samurai that did not become kazoku were designated as shizoku, a distinct class without class privileges that was purely a title on the government register. Commoners and the Burakumin were merged into a single commoner class without restrictions or distinction for their occupation, though Burakumin continued to face discrimination similar to Edo society.

The IMAX theatre has the largest screen in Canada. Les Galeries de la Capitale is the largest mall in the city with . It is also the infrastructure in Quebec City with the highest tax value at $320 million in 2007. With 11 million visitors annually, Galeries de la Capitale ranked in 2012 as the second most visited shopping mall in Quebec City after Laurier Qu√©bec and the fourth in the province as a whole. History Les Galeries de la Capitale was the idea of businessman Marcel Adams. The mall was inaugurated in 1981 in a deserted part of the city on a field of . At the time the mall was owned at 50% by Les D√©veloppements Iberville (the real estate company of Marcel Adams), at 25% by Eaton Properties (the real estate company of Eaton's), and at 25% by Markborough Properties (the real estate company of the Hudson's Bay Company).

Not even a year after its inauguration, Cooprix at Galeries de la Capitale permanently closed its doors on May 26, 1982. 1988 saw the opening of the indoor amusement park Mega-Parc, the second largest of its kind in Canada after West Edmonton Mall. The park, composed of 20 amusement rides, included a Ferris wheel, some roller coasters and a skating rink for ice hockey games.

Due to a lack of profitability from this particular store since its inception, Provigo decided to reduced its space and subleased the vacant part to toy retailer Toyville which opened on October 1, 1987. Toyville closed on December 29, 1990 and Provigo on May 1992. Woolco was converted to Wal-Mart in 1994 as part of the American parent company's entrance to Canada. In early 2002, Wal-Mart left Galeries de la Capitale to relocate on the nearby parking, allowing its former space in the mall to be replaced on July 13 of the same year by rival Zellers, itself relocating from a previous address in the Neufch√¢tel neighborhood. http://collections.banq.qc.ca/ark:/52327/bs29078 Eaton went bankrupt in 1999 and its location at Galeries de la Capitale was the sole store in the province that Sears Canada had acquired. The store was converted into the Sears banner without ever closing down. https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/sears-buys-eaton-s-name-eight-stores-1.188722 The mall was sold on December 1, 2005 for $358 million to a consortium consisting of Canada Pension Plan (80%); Osmington, an investment firm in Toronto (10%); and Westerkirk, a Toronto real estate firm (10%). Redcliff Realty Management was hired to manage the mall. Since June 4, 2013, Galeries de la Capitale is owned and operated by Oxford Properties. In Spring 2011, Galeries de la Capitale opened a new section of the mall. The new section was added between the upper level McDonald's and the IMAX theatre. The new section included Best Buy's first Quebec City location, a Sports Experts store, and a new Toys \\"R\\" Us (the latter opening before the others on November 2010). Zellers (formerly Woolco/Wal-Mart) closed its doors in February 2013 and was replaced by Target from 2013 until early 2015 when it ceased all retail operations across Canada. Simons doubled its size to 80,000 square feet by relocating to the vacant Target in 2017. In 2017, Sears Canada announced they would be closing all their remaining stores. This includes the store at Galeries de la Capitale. After almost 30 years in operation, the Mega-Parc closed on September 4, 2017 to undergo major renovations.

Access is by the public space known as Independence Square or Plaza Grande (colloquial name), around which are also the Archbishop's Palace, Municipal Palace, Hotel Plaza Grande, and Metropolitan Cathedral.  History  The history of this emblematic building dates back to colonial times, around 1570, with the acquisition of the former royal houses located in the city of Quito.  First royal houses  The first seat of the Spanish Crown in the Royal Audience of Quito functioned near the convent of La Merced (current Cuenca and Chile streets). After Diego Suarez de Figueroa, secretary of the audience, died in 1611, the government took over his small palace, built in the central square (Plaza Grande). , president of the Audience, informed the king that the building was available. It was purchased by the Crown as a larger building to house the Spanish administration in Quito. Some time later, Recalde's successor, President Antonio de Morga, informed the king that the royal houses needed to be replaced, as they were very old. He proposed buying the adjacent houses. The earthquake of 1627 caused damage and the government was forced to buy the neighboring buildings to restore them. They were rebuilt in stone and brick. Thereafter, the seat of the audience was settled in the front of the Plaza Grande.  New palace  March Revolution. Oil painting by Rafael Salas. In 1799, the Bar√≥n Francisco Luis H√©ctor de Carondelet was appointed chairman of the Audience. In 1801, the Spanish hired Antonio Garcia, to perform the work of rehabilitation and improvements, both of the Audience Palace and the Cathedral. He also led the work on the arches of the sewers and the renovation of the Prison building. After the independence of Ecuador ended with the Battle of Pichincha in 1822, the palace became the headquarters of the South Department of Gran Colombia, welcoming the liberator Sim√≥n Bol√≠var sometimes. He wondered at the elegance and austerity of the building and was delighted with the taste of the Baron of Carondelet (main person in charge of the work); thus, Bolivar gave the building the name of Carondelet Palace.  Republican era  The Yellow Hall or President's Hall. During the Republican era, almost all the presidents (constitutional, internees and dictators) have worked in this building, which is the seat of Government of the Republic of Ecuador. There has been some changes over the years, the most important in the presidencies of Gabriel Garc√≠a Moreno, Camilo Ponce Enr√≠quez and Sixto Dur√°n Ball√©n. Besides the administrative offices in the third level of the Palace, we find the presidential residence, a luxurious colonial-style apartment in which the President and his family live. Currently, the Presidency and Vice Presidency of the Republic and the Ministry of the Interior, occupy the Complex of Carondelet, which includes the buildings of the former Post Office (presently on Benalc√°zar street, between Chile and Espejo) and the Government Palace, separated by the garage.  Opening to the public  During the presidency of Rafael Correa, the Ecuadorian government declared the Carondelet Palace and its agencies an Ecuadorian cultural heritage, and transformed the presidential compound into a museum open to the public. Designated areas were organized to house objects within their cultural contexts, allotting several rooms and spaces within the palace, so as to make them publicly accessible. To carry out this work, Maria del Carmen Molestina, researcher, PhD in Archaeology, and former director of the Museum of the Central Bank of Ecuador, cataloged objects and identified places to exhibit the gifts that the president has received while in office. Furthermore, she located objects and antique furniture with cultural value from within the palace to be placed in the exhibition gallery. Under this system, it is now possible to acknowledge the cultural, historical and/or ethnographic value to presidential gifts and to identify all objects that represent and embody customs, traditions, ideologies, and forms of thinking of different Ecuadorian ethnic groups.

Plunder of the palace  According to the researcher, Dr. Mar√≠a del Carmen Molestina, it is amazing how, over the years, the Carondelet Palace has been looted. Most of the furniture and items that can be seen today are new; even some of the bronze fittings from the furniture dating for the time of Garcia Moreno have been replaced by copies of gold-sprayed lead. The investigation, which Dr. Molestina is currently conducting, is directed at when the so-called looting began. The Carondelet Palace was restored during the presidency of Camilo Ponce Enriquez (1956-1960) and until the presidency of Le√≥n Febres Cordero (1984-1988), all was as it should have been. From that period there is no information about the fate of much of the belongings of the Presidential Palace. Additionally, Molestina believes that everything was kept until the presidency of Rodrigo Borja (1988-1992) after which Sixto Dur√°n Ball√©n (1992-1996) ordered a new presidential suite on the third floor of the palace.

There is no romance to the blood and heat and animal terror communicated to workers (and readers) as it emanates from the killing floors of the Omaha meatpacking industry.\\" In 2003, while he was still a doctoral student at the University of Iowa and working at the Iowa Review, Genoways was hired by the University of Virginia to edit the Virginia Quarterly Review. He served as editor for the next nine years, during which time the magazine received six National Magazine Awards, two Utne Independent Press Awards, and an Overseas Press Club Award. In 2012, Genoways announced that he was stepping down as editor of VQR to pursue his writing career. Genoways has since become a contributing writer at Mother Jones and The New Republic, as well as an editor-at-large at Pacific Standard. His essays and poetry have appeared in The Atlantic, Bloomberg Businessweek, Harper's, The New Republic, The New York Times Magazine, Outside, Poetry, and the Washington Post Book World. He has received a James Beard Foundation Award for Investigative Reporting, a MOTHER, and the James Aronson Award for Social Justice Journalism. In October 2014, Genoways published the book The Chain: Farm, Factory, and the Fate of Our Food, which Eric Schlosser in the New York Times Book Review called an \\"important book, well worth reading, full of compelling stories, genuine outrage and the careful exposure of corporate lies.\\" In September 2017, Genoways published This Blessed Earth: A Year in the Life of an American Farm Family, which Arlo Crawford in the New York Times Book Review called \\"a cleareyed and unsentimental look at how farming has become relentlessly optimized by automation, markets and politics; factors that don‚Äôt always take into account the guy who‚Äôs actually driving the tractor.\\" This Blessed Earth won the Nebraska Book Award, but Governor Pete Ricketts refused to sign the customary proclamation declaring the winner on the grounds that the This Blessed Earth, is written by a \\"political activist\\" whose book is \\"divisive.\\" According to Publishers Weekly, his next book Tequila Wars: The Bloody Struggle for the Spirit of Mexico is scheduled to be edited by John Glusman at Norton. \\"Tequila Wars examines agave farming in Mexico and aims to 'tell the story of the modern tequila industry.'\\" Works ;Nonfiction *Blessed Earth: A Year in the Life of an American Farm Family, W.

Plot A galactic deep- space cargo ship is blown off course by a photon storm. When the crew recover, they find themselves in an unexplored region of space and one of their members, known as Pusher, is dead. The Crew comprises varied members of vastly different intelligent races, all in close mental rapport known as the Cooperation, and serving specialized functions; they are known as Engine, Thinker, Eye etc. But without a Pusher, they cannot sustain FTL speeds and are unlikely to reach home before most of the crew die of old age. They manage to locate a planet rich in primitive Pushers, Earth. They try to communicate with a man they find, but he is so violent and resistant that they are forced to bring him on board the ship to try to reason with him. The Crew, used to close cooperation, find it hard to understand his mistrust and fear. Gradually, the man begins to realize the nature of the Crew and the pleasure to be found as a part of the Cooperation. He agrees to join the crew. Hesitantly at first, he tries to push and finally learns how it is done. The ship speeds away.

When Goldsworthy died in 1889 he was the first Wales rugby union international to die. Rugby career Goldsworthy gained his first international cap, when he was selected to play for Joe Simpson's Wales, against Ireland on 12 April 1884. Played as part of the 1884 Home Nations Championship, this was Ireland's first international in Wales, and the Welsh selectors chose six new caps to represent Wales after the previous game against Scotland. Of the three new players introduced into the pack, Goldsworthy was the only player to represent Wales more than once, as Hinton of Cardiff and Roderick of Llanelli were dropped the very next game. Wales won the game by a drop goal and two tries to nil, and Goldsworthy was reselected the next season. Wales only played two international matches in the 1884-85 season, but Goldsworthy played in both. The first was a home game at Swansea against England. Charlie Newman regained his position and the captaincy, but the game is more notable as the first international for future Welsh rugby talisman Arthur 'Monkey' Gould. The selectors again reshuffled the Welsh pack, which saw three new forward caps, including Goldsworthy's Swansea teammate, Evan Richards. Wales lost the match, but a more stable team was chosen for the away game to Scotland. The first two encounters between the teams had resulted in Scottish victories, therefore the final result of nil-nil was an improvement for Wales, though the press was critical of Wales as the team employed spoiling tactics to kill the game.

(also known as \\"General Pants\\") is an Australian fashion retailer operating across ACT, NSW, TAS, VIC, QLD, SA and WA that sells both international and national brands. The retailer specialises in streetwear, denim, skate clothing and surfwear. As of April 2014, the company operates 56 stores. History General Pants Company was originally conceived and started by Tom and Bronwyn Tsipris on 20 April 1972. They opened their first store on George Street Wynyard, Sydney and grew the chain to 20 stores throughout the Sydney metropolitan and regional areas. In addition to General Pants, they purchased the Surf Dive 'n' Ski (NSW) chain in 1979 which they expanded and ran in conjunction with the General Pants stores. On 1 December 1995 they sold the General Pants stores to the Smorgon Group. The Surf Dive‚Äôn Ski stores were later sold to the Smorgon / Jetty Surf Group in 2005, and were later sold to Billabong. The international company acquired the retail stores, numbering 38 at the time of sale, for \\"$35 to $45 million\\" on 1 November 2010‚Äîtwo licensed Billabong stores were also included as part of the sale. The brand entered into a partnership with the Peer Group Media company in 2010 to launch the Major Label music initiative. As of April 2013, Major Label is a record label that is wholly owned by General Pants Co., and allows artists to maintain ownership of copyright, retain full creative control and receive all of the royalty income that is generated through digital music sales. The label only releases singles and the staff of General Pants Co. act as the label's talent scouts and promoters‚Äîartists have been invited to submit their demo recordings at General Pants Co. retail store locations. Guineafowl, Circle Pit and High Highs were the first three acts that signed deals with the label, and Sydney band Buzz Kull were chosen in the May‚ÄìJune 2013 period. Controversy In 2011, the company published a racy poster advertisement depicting a scantily clad woman with another person's hands unzipping her pants. The Australian Advertising Standards Bureau logged 37 complaints about the advertisement. The company later censored the posters after consumer complaints, covering parts of the posters. Also during this time, the company was criticised for forcing its store employees to wear badges stating \\"I love sex\\" and for using naked mannequins in its stores. After consumer complaints, the company covered the mannequins in their stores, but continued to have employees wear the \\"I love sex\\" badges. Some female store employees expressed disapproval of being made to wear the badges, with one referring to it as \\"inappropriate\\", and another stating that she felt \\"uncomfortable\\" wearing the badge, finding it \\"embarrassing\\" and \\"demeaning\\".

It opened in 1971 on the corner of U.S. Route 9 southbound and Symmes Drive and was demolished in 1998 to be replaced by the Manalapan EpiCentre. The mall was anchored by Steinbach, and had 25 stores attached to its south side. A second phase would have included a Macy's, a Sears, and would have grown to a total of 100 stores, but the plans were shelved because of financial problems. By the 1980s, plans were submitted for a super-regional mall, the Freehold Raceway Mall, about south on Route 9. In 1996, the Steinbach chain was bought out, and the Manalapan Mall store was not included in the purchase.\\"Six Sites Not Included in Sale Changes are in Store North Jersey is Saying Goodbye to Steinbach\\", The Record (Bergen County), January 4, 1996.

Forming out of a tropical depression on September 16, Yagi quickly strengthened as it executed a slow clockwise loop over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. On September 19, Yagi strengthened into a typhoon as a subtropical ridge steered the storm towards the west. Two days later, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 910 hPa (mbar). The typhoon gradually weakened as it recurved towards the northeast and was downgraded to a severe tropical storm on September 24 and became extratropical the next day. The storm was last noted near the Aleutian Islands on September 27\\\\. The typhoon caused severe damage on the island of Chichijima but no injuries were reported as a result of the storm. Meteorological history On September 16, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring an area of convection as a tropical depression about 1,270 km (790 mi) east-northeast of Guam. The depression was located within an area of low to moderate wind shear under an upper-level anticyclone. Flaring convection was noted along the eastern portion of the developing system before the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert later that day. Early on September 17, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Depression 16W. Located within a weak steering environment, the storm executed a clockwise loop while quickly strengthening. Several hours after the JTWC issued their first advisory, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and gave it the name Yagi; the name was contributed by Japan, and is the Japanese word for \\"goat\\". Late on September 18, the JMA upgraded Yagi to a severe tropical storm while the JTWC classified the storm as a minimal typhoon. Early on September 19, the JMA upgraded Yagi to a typhoon. After completing the loop, Yagi's track was influenced by a subtropical ridge located to the southeast of Japan. The typhoon continued to intensify and reached its peak intensity on September 21 with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 910 hPa (mbar), making it the strongest storm of the season according to the JMA. At the same time, the JTWC classified Yagi as a Category 5 super typhoon with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph 1-minute winds). On September 22, Yagi passed by the islands of Iwo Jima and Chichijima as the storm recurved towards the northeast. With increasing wind shear, the typhoon began to weaken and also began to undergo an extratropical transition. Late on September 24, the JTWC classified the storm as an extratropical cyclone and issued their final advisory. The JMA kept Yagi as a tropical system for another day as it weakened to a severe tropical storm. Early on September 25, they classified it as extratropical. The remnants of Yagi continued towards the northeast and crossed the International Date Line on September 27\\\\. The storm was last noted near the Aleutian Islands. Preparations and impact Typhoon Yagi near Ogasawara Islands on September 22 On September 23, Typhoon Yagi passed directly over the resort island of Chichijima which has a population of about 2,000. The cyclone brought winds up to 210 km/h (130 mph), making it the strongest typhoon in 20 years to hit the island. About 1,000 of the 1,270 homes were without power during the height of the storm. About 150 residents evacuated to local shelters during the storm to escape the high winds and heavy rains. At least one structure was destroyed and numerous others sustained damage. The storm reportedly produced torrential rains, but there are no known measurements. Several homes had their roofs blown off and windows broken. Street lamps were knocked down by the strong winds produced by Yagi. Ferry service for several ports was cancelled for 29 days following the typhoon. Fallen trees knocked down power lines and cut communications. Some homes were reported to have lost water pressure also. The storm passed close to Iwo Jima on September 22, with the island being within the range of 95 km/h (60 mph) winds. No loss of life or injuries were related to Typhoon Yagi.

It was founded in 1960 to coordinate environmental opposition to Project Chariot, a plan to dig a harbor in Alaska's North Slope with nuclear weapons, and to fight the proposed Rampart Dam project on the Yukon River. Later, the society took a stance on the development of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, encouraging environmental mitigation during and after its construction, becoming a major factor in environmental policy within the state.Haycox, pp. 267-268 The group operated between 1960 and 1993 and was superseded by the Alaska Conservation Foundation, which was founded in 1980 and still operates today.

Career Zubair was an architect by training. Worried by the negative perceptions of Muslims, she \\"felt there should be an American Muslim media where her kids could grow up feeling really strong about their identity as an American Muslim\\" and came up with the idea for Bridges TV. She also studied for an MBA at State University of New York College at Buffalo from 2007 to 2009. Zubair was the focus of a cover story in the Vol. 3, Issue 2 (2003) issue of Azizah Magazine; her face appeared on the cover. Journalist Nadirah Sabir wrote about how Zubair conceived the idea of the nation's first Muslim television channel.  Murder  Muzzamill Hassan lured Zubair to the television studio where they worked together, on February 12, 2009. He attacked her with two hunting knives, stabbing her forty times and finally severing her head. Zubair had filed for divorce a week prior to her murder.

Wajahat Ali, acclaimed playwright and founder of GoatMilk,GoatMilk.Wordpress.com wrote in The Guardian that \\"[t]he absolute brutality of Aasiya's murder has served as a clarion call to many American Muslims who have passionately responded to the tragedy with a resounding desire to confront this festering calamity.\\" Imam Mohamed Hagmagid Ali, vice-president of The Islamic Society of North America, stated: \\"This is a wake up call to all of us, that violence against women is real and can not be ignored. It must be addressed collectively by every member of our community.\\" A nationwide, unified effort entitled \\"Imams Speak Out: Domestic Violence Will Not Be Tolerated in Our Communities\\" commenced in February 2009 asking all imams and religious leaders to discuss the Zubair murder, as well as domestic violence, in their weekly sermon on their Friday prayer services.

The two-story basement of the tower housed a prison in the 16th‚Äì17th centuries. There is the Troitsky Bridge, which is protected by the Kutafia Tower and leads to the gates of the Troitskaya Tower. There was also a clock on top of the tower between 1585 and 1812. In 1707, due to a threat of Swedish invasion, the gun slots of the Troitskaya Tower were enlarged to fit heavy cannons. In 1935, the Soviets installed a red star on top of the Troitskaya Tower. Prior to Soviet rule the tower had an icon of the Holy Trinity atop its outward face. Because this tower was the formal entrance for huge Communist Party Congresses the icon was totally removed rather than just plastered over as were those on the Spasskaya and Nikolskaya Towers.

It covers area of and has population of 31,097 (according to the 2011 census). The word means \\"hazel bushes\\" in Lithuanian. History 1893 map of the area from the Russian Empire Since the 1950s, the Baltic states experienced fast population growth and faced housing shortages. When the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev put forth his program of fast residential construction, based on prefabricated panel buildings dubbed khrushchovkas, it threatened the integrity of the well-preserved historical style of Vilnius. A group of architects struggled against the intrusion of khrushchovkas into the historical city center. Eventually they were awarded with the project to build a satellite city outside Vilnius. The chosen area was close to a Polish village of Leszczyniaki or Lazdynai in Lithuanian, situated southeast of old Vilnius.Both names, Leszczyniaki and Lazdynai apparently derive from the word for \\"hazelnut tree\\": Polish leszczyna and Lithuanian lazdynas. In Polish language the term leszczyniak (singular for \\"leszczyniaki\\") also means \\"a person from Leszno or Leszno Voivodeship\\", see, e.g., the usage here). The architects decided to go against the Soviet architectural style and based their design on study of the architecture of Finland. Initially the authorities monitored the project with suspicion, but eventually it was accepted, and in 1974 the leading figures of the Lazdynai project (architects Vytautas ƒåekanauskas, Vytautas Brƒódikis, Vytautas Balƒçi≈´nas, and Gediminas Valiu≈°kis and engineers Algimantas Kleinotas and Vincentas ≈†ileika) were awarded the Lenin Prize in architecture.Becker, Sven (November 23, 2005). \\"The architectural battleground for Lithuanian independence\\", The Baltic Times See also *Vilnius Minties Gymnasium Notes References Category:Neighbourhoods of Vilnius ","title":"Lazdynai"},{"id":"21604518","text":"Atacazo is a volcano of the Western Cordillera located 25 kilometers southwest of Quito, Ecuador.

Anne was the wife of Charles II d'Albret. One of her illustrious descendants was Queen Jeanne III of Navarre, mother of King Henry IV, the first Bourbon king of France. Her illegitimate son was Jean de Lescun, known as the \\"bastard of Armagnac\\".  Family  Anne was born in 1402 in Gages, near Rodez, France, the daughter of Bernard VII of Armagnac, Count of Charolais, Count of Armagnac, and Bonne de Berry, who was the widow of Amadeus VII of Savoy. Anne had six siblings, these included John IV of Armagnac, Bernard of Armagnac, and Bonne of Armagnac, wife of Charles, Duke of Orl√©ans. She had three half-siblings from her mother's marriage to Count Amadeus, including Amadeus VIII of Savoy. Her paternal grandparents were John II of Armagnac and Jeanne de P√©rigord, and her maternal grandparents were John, Duke of Berry and Jeanne of Armagnac. Anne's father was head of the powerful, pro- French, pro-Orl√©ans Armagnac party which played a prominent role in French politics in the early 15th century, and whose bitter opponents during the Armagnac-Burgundian Civil War were the pro-English Burgundians, headed by John the Fearless. On 30 December 1415, her father was appointed Constable of France. He controlled the government of the Dauphin Charles (the future King Charles VII of France). On 12 June 1418, he was assassinated in Paris by the Burgundians.Charles Cawley, Medieval Lands, Gascony, Dukes and Nobility Anne died on an unknown date sometime before March 1473.

Through Alain, who married Fran√ßoise of Ch√¢tillon-Limoges (died 1481), Anne was an ancestress of Queen Jeanne III of Navarre, mother of Henry IV.  Marriage and issue  On 28 October 1417, a marriage contract was drawn up and signed, and less than six months later, on 23 April 1418, Anne married Charles II d'Albret, Sire d'Albret and titular Count of Dreux (1401‚Äì1471). He was the eldest son of Charles d'Albret, Constable of France who had been killed at the Battle of Agincourt on 25 October 1415, as co-commander of the French Army. At the time of his marriage, Charles was only the titular Count of Dreux as the lands were in English hands. He would be confirmed as count in 1441 by King Charles VII of France. He served on the royal council of the Dauphin Charles. He participated in the military campaigns of Joan of Arc, including the Siege of Orl√©ans, and was appointed lieutenant of the province of Berry.

Football career Early career Fraser was born in Cowpen, near Blyth, Northumberland and played for Blyth Spartans as a junior. He then had a spell in the Army, with the Royal Tank Corps before starting his professional career with Northampton Town in November 1926. He spent two seasons with Northampton Town in the Third Division South, making 17 league appearances generally on the right wing, scoring four goals as well as providing scoring chances for centre forwards Ernie Cockle and Harry Loasby. He signed for Aldershot, then in the Southern League, in May 1929 but before he made any first team appearances he was transferred to Second Division Southampton in June for a fee of ¬£200. Southampton He made his \\"Saints\\" debut on 14 December 1929, replacing Oswald Littler at inside right in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Reading. Fraser made nine appearances in the No. 8 shirt, before being replaced by Jerry Mackie in March. In the 1930‚Äì31 season, Fraser took over at centre forward from the injured Willie Haines after the first match of the season and during a run of thirteen games up front scored six goals before Johnny McIlwaine took over. Fraser then reverted to inside right before being replaced by Laurie Cumming for a few matches before Mackie returned in January, although Fraser played the last five games of the season. By the start of the following season Mackie had retired, and Fraser played at inside forward until Christmas before injury forced him to miss most of the rest of the season. During his absence, manager George Kay tried eight players at No. 8, of which only Frank Osborne played more than four games. According to Holley & Chalk, Fraser \\"had considerable ability, (but) suffered acutely from nerves in front of crowds\\". In July 1932, he was sold to Fulham for a fee of ¬£500 (together with fellow forwards Arthur Haddleton and Bert Jepson) as the Saints were in serious financial difficulties and needed to raise funds. Later career He joined Fulham in July 1932, but was unable to break into the first team with long-serving Jim Hammond hardly missing a match for seven years.

It is also associated with movement, coordination, and direct attention. LBLD is not usually identified until the child reaches school age. Most people with this disability find it hard to communicate, to express ideas efficiently and what they say may be ambiguous and hard to understandM.B. Aria. Learn How To Be A Better Parent And Raise Healthy Happy Children It is a neurological difference. It is often hereditary, and is frequently associated to specific language problems. There are two types of learning disabilities: non-verbal, which includes disabilities from psychomotor difficulties to dyscalculia, and verbal, language based.American Speech-Language-Hearing Association Symptoms LBLD consists of dyscalculia which comprises the reading of numbers sequentially, learning the time table, and telling time; dyslexia; and difficulties associated with written language such as trouble learning new vocabulary, letters and alphabets. Auditory processing disorders can cause trouble understanding questions and following directions, understanding and remembering the details of a story's plot or a classroom lecture, learning words to songs and rhymes, telling left from right, and having a hard time with reading and writing . Difficulties associated with reading and spoken language involve trouble understanding questions and following directions, understanding and retaining the details of a story's plot or a classroom lecture, nonword repetition, learning words to songs and rhymes, and identifying the sounds that correspond to letters, which makes learning to read difficult Difficulties associated with motor skills include difficulty telling left from right which is part of motor incoordination, visual perceptual problems, and memory problem Prevalence 15‚Äì20% of the children in the United States have a language-based learning disability. Of the students with specific learning disabilities receiving special education services, 70‚Äì80% have a discrepancy in reading. Diagnosis A speech- language pathologist (SLP), psychologist, social worker, and sometimes neurologist work together or individually to find the proper diagnosis for children with LBLD. Additionally, they evaluate speaking, listening, reading, and written language for children who have LBLD. * SLPs evaluate the child's comprehension skills, and the child's ability to follow verbal and written directions. Also, they look for responsiveness, and see if the child recognizes familiar signs or holds a book correctly and they look for whether the child knows and/or writes letters, and names. * Social workers obtain literacy history from the home, and then observe the child during classroom activities, they look for social interactions. * Psychologists review a child's phonological memory by having him or her repeat series of words, numbers, letters, and sounds. They also look for response from the child to environmental and social factors. * Neurologists look for motor skills, brain functions which include visual and auditory perception. Dyslexia Dyslexia is a common language-based learning disability. Dyslexia can affect reading fluency, decoding, reading comprehension, recall, writing, spelling, and sometimes speech and can exist along with other related disorders. The greatest difficult those with the disorder have is with spoken and the written word. These issues present pertain but are not limited to: *Expressing ideas clearly, as if the words needed are on the tip of the tongue but won't come out. *Letters and numbers *Learning the alphabet *Mixing up the order of numbers that are a part of math calculations *Spelling *Memorizing the times tables *Telling time Prognosis LBLD can be an enduring problem. Some people might experience overlapping learning disabilities that make improvement problematic. Others with single disabilities often show more improvement. Most subjects can achieve literacy via coping mechanisms and education. Treatment Special education classes are the primary treatment. These classes focus on activities that sustain growth in language skills. The foundation of this treatment is repetition of oral, reading and writing activities. Usually the SLP, psychologist and the teacher work together with the children in small groups in the class room. Another treatment is looking at a child's needs through the Individual Education Plan (IEP). In this program teachers and parents work together to monitor the progress of the child's comprehensive, verbal, written, social, and motor skills in school and in the home. Then the child goes through different assessments to determine his/her level. The level that the child is placed in will determine the class size, number of teachers, and the need for therapy.

Later, Harry and Mary Jane take Lily to safety, but Carlie was too angry with Lily and instead focuses her energy on trying to find Peter. She is confronted by Tombstone.The Amazing Spider-Man #643 The police arrive and Tombstone escapes but later doubles back to follow her after discovering that Carlie knows Menace's secret identity. Carlie, Mary Jane, and Lily are able to defeat Tombstone when he attacks them.The Amazing Spider-Man #645 Afterward, Peter and Carlie continue to hang out for a time, but Peter lacks the courage to ask her out, leaving Carlie fuming. She gives him an ultimatum and after seeing her at Harry's going-away party, Peter asks her to be his girlfriend. The two kiss and begin dating.The Amazing Spider-Man #647 \\"Big Time\\" Peter and Carlie have now been dating for a short while. When Michele Gonzales moves back to Chicago, Peter considers moving in with Carlie but she decides that it is too early in the relationship. It is at this time that Peter discovers Carlie is a roller derby participant, using the sport to help her unleash any pent up anger. Her roller derby name is \\"Crusher Carlie\\".The Amazing Spider-Man #648 When Peter is called out on a mission with the Future Foundation, he tells Carlie he is going away on a business trip for his new job at Horizon Labs. Carlie is very angry when she finds out that there was no trip. She takes her rage out in the rink which results in her being sent off mid-game for a vicious assault on \\"Iron Mavis\\" from the other side. Noticing her bad mood, two of her teammates offer to take her out for a night on the town. After getting drunk, Carlie decides to get a tattoo of the Green Goblin's insignia to spite Peter, knowing his opinion of Norman Osborn (as he had murdered Peter's first girlfriend Gwen Stacy).The Amazing Spider- Man #659 However, she changes her mind and gets a tattoo of Spider-Man. She is worried that the tattoo will make things awkward between herself and Peter, but he assures her that it is not the case. During the \\"Return of Anti-Venom\\" storyline, Carlie correctly deduces that the new Wraith is her police captain Yuri Watanabe using a mask Mysterio created that could impersonate the face of the late Jean Dewolff since only they and Spider-Man knew about it. This becomes more obvious when she visits evidence storage and learns of a mysterious incident that supposedly destroyed the mask with Watanabe being the last visitor beforehand. Having secretly placed her cell phone into Watanabe's pocket earlier and following her, Carlie's suspicions are confirmed. Rather than turn Watanabe in like she previously did to Vin and her father, Carlie agrees to keep it secret and suggests that Watanabe needs to improve on covering her tracks for her own safety.The Amazing Spider-Man #663-664 \\"Spider-Island\\" During the events that lead to the \\"Spider-Island\\" storyline, Carlie confronts Peter about his connection to Spider-Man, and accepts his explanation that he designs all of Spider-Man's technology,The Amazing Spider-Man #664 (which was essentially the truth). She later gains spider-powers due to the Jackal's genetically-altered bedbugs, with the addition of organic webs.The Amazing Spider-Man #667 However, her mutation, like the millions of others in New York City, turns her into a monstrous spider-being.The Amazing Spider-Man #669 She and the rest of the civilian population were eventually cured when Spider-Man uses Doctor Octopus' octo- bots to disperse the antidote.The Amazing Spider-Man #672 When she returns to normal, Carlie breaks up with Peter after deducing that he is Spider-Man, furious that she has been lied to once again. She and Peter are on a sort of truce as she requires Spider-Man's help in order to investigate the death of a gothic teen who died from falling from a great height and was ruled as a suicide.The Amazing Spider-Man #674 Carlie works the case without police approval, putting her at odds with Chief Pratchett. Shortly after the case is resolved, Carlie, still conflicted over her feelings for Peter, confides in Peter's best friend and ex Mary Jane despite her initial anger over MJ also knowing Peter's identity.The Amazing Spider-Man #675 \\"Superior Spider- Man\\" Around the end of the Dying Wish storyline, Carlie Cooper catches Doctor Octopus breaking into the NYPD to reclaim his golden Octobot. She tries to stop him, not knowing that Doctor Octopus is really Peter Parker's mind in Otto's body. Peter/\\"Otto\\" tries to calm her down, but she shoots him, causing him to defend himself with a tentacle, the bullet ricocheting off his arm and shooting through Carlie's shoulder, to his shock. She is taken to the hospital, where she recovers.The Amazing Spider-Man #700 Later, Mary Jane and Carlie are surprised by some footage showing the Superior Spider-Man shaking hands with Mayor J. Jonah Jameson, who came to thank Spider-Man, for stopping the Sinister Six. They both agree that things are weird. Carlie mentions that things have been weird since her run in with Doctor Octopus, but does not explain why. Mary Jane confides in her that she and Peter seem to be getting back together, shocking Carlie. When Mary Jane tells Carlie that the Superior Spider-Man broke it off with her just when they were getting back together, Carlie decides to \\"go back to work\\", wanting to know what really happened to \\"Peter\\".The Superior Spider-Man #2 It is heavily implied that Carlie knows who Superior Spider-Man really is, but she is keeping it to herself until she can find proof.The Superior Spider-Man #8 Soon while lurking in the shadows while Captain Wantanabe interviews police witnesses to Superior Spider-Man killing Massacre at point blank, Carlie appears to have also confided in one mysterious person about her speculation, this person was later revealed to be Wraith.The Superior Spider-Man #9 Carlie and the Wraith, later follow a lead how the new Spider-Squad is being funded, as it is not being financed by Mayor Jameson's initiatives.The Superior Spider-Man #18 After investigating the foreign bank accounts of Super villains, it is revealed that Carlie has stumbled upon proof that an account belonging to Doctor Octopus is funding the new Spider Squad. Therefore, she has made the connection of her suspicions that Superior Spider-Man is Doctor Octopus in Peter Parker's body.The Superior Spider-Man #19 Later, Carlie mourns Peter being buried under Doctor Octopus' headstone. She respects and apologizes for not believing him and makes Doctor Octopus pay for what he had done. The grave collapses to discover that Doctor Octopus' grave is empty. Before continuing, Carlie is kidnapped by Menace and brought to the Goblin King's lair. She grabs Carlie's journal and gives it to the Goblin King where he learns about Superior Spider-Man's secret.The Superior Spider-Man #21 With all the evidence of Doctor Octopus' mind being in Spider-Man's body, the Goblin King still tries to interrogate Carlie about why she left Spider-Man's true identity out of her journal. He tries to take it out of her, but she refuses to reply, prompting Menace to take over the interrogation.The Superior Spider-Man #23 The Goblin King sprays the Goblin Formula on Carlie after she still refuses to divulge the true identity of Superior Spider-Man, causing her to writhe in agony.The Superior Spider-Man #24 The Goblin Formula used on Carlie begins to take effect transforming her into one of them and the Goblin King nicknamed her \\"Monster\\". When prompted to reveal the Spider Man's identity by the Goblin King, Carlie questioned who Goblin King was to which he replied that he is Norman Osborn. Carlie did not believe him and asked him to remove his mask to prove the fact. The Goblin King however wanted Carlie to prove that she was a real member of the Goblin Nation first before doing so. Monster joins Menace into attacking Hobgoblin's henchmen Ringer, Steeplejack, and Tumbler. Steeplejack ends up shooting Monster only to be viciously attacked by her in response earning her place in the Goblin Nation after Goblin Knight kills Steeplejack.The Superior Spider- Man #25 At the time when the Goblin Nation was causing havoc in Manhattan, Monster attacks Parker Industries where Otto gets her away from the other people inside. Superior Spider-Man was shocked to discover that Monster is Carlie. Superior Spider-Man deploys Living Brain to fight Monster while he and Sajani Jaffrey flee inside. He tells Sajani to split up wanting to direct Monster's attention to him. He succeeds and Otto fights Monster in a closed room. He lands a kick which breaks the earpiece on Monster and she informs him that because of this, the Goblin King would not be able to listen to them. She states that she needs Otto or Peter's brains to fix this situation and fix her as well before she loses control. Telling Otto to hurry, she says that Otto has no idea what the Goblin King has planned for him and this world. Carlie also mentioned that she is unsure of the Goblin King's claim of being Norman Osborn.The Superior Spider-Man #28 Sajani continues to work on the cure for the Goblin Serum when Carlie gets loses control while waiting for it, Wraith breaks free from the grip of Living Brain and makes her way to where Sajani and Carlie are. In the brief fight, Wraith is unable to see Carlie as her technology has been hacked by the Goblin King to render any goblin undetectable, Sajani completes the cure as Wraith restrains Carlie long enough for Sajani to inject the cure into her to change back into human form, with Carlie falling unconscious afterwards. Wraith leaves Carlie in Sajani's care as she heads off.The Superior Spider-Man Annual #2 In the aftermath, as she was still recovering from the effects of the Goblin serum, Carlie has one last talk with Mary Jane where she has decided to leave New York since she realized that she will always remain a target as long as she remains close to Peter Parker or Spider-Man and wants to move to a less dangerous place where she could work as a police forensic officer without having to deal with any supervillains.The Superior Spider-Man #31 \\"Fresh Start\\" Carlie returned to New York during Marvel's \\"Fresh Start\\" relaunch. She catches up with Mary Jane in a coffee shop and reveals she did lab work down in New Orleans before deciding to returning to New York. Noticing that Mary Jane is dating Peter once more, she decides to introduce her to a support group featuring friends and loved ones of superheroes called \\"The Lookups\\".Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #9 Powers and abilities Carlie Cooper is an expert at forensics. As Monster, Carlie Cooper has likely obtained similar powers to Green Goblin due to the Goblin Formula circulating within her system which grants her superhuman strength, stamina, and speed. Other versions MC2 In the MC-2 Universe, Peter works with the police department after retiring as Spider-Man. Carlie is the person who gave Peter the idea to work with the police.The Amazing Spider-Man Family #4 Spider-Island During the Secret Wars storyline, a variation of Carlie Cooper resides on the Battleworld domain of Spider-Island. Carlie was mutated into a spider monster alongside Mary Jane, Betty Brant, and Sharon Carter by the Spider Queen and used as bait by the heroes. Spider-Man, Agent Venom, and Iron Goblin use Curt Connors' Lizard Formula to mutate the ladies into lizards, but free their minds from the Spider Queen's control.Spider-Island #3 Carlie later joined the resistance into attacking the Spider Queen's lair.Spider-Island #4 In other media * Carlie Cooper appears as a non-playable character in Spider-Man Unlimited, voiced by Tara Platt.

After four failed launches from 576B, it was discovered that the umbilical was releasing prematurely at liftoff when it still had live electrical current in it, which shorted out components in the missiles. Repairs were made during early 1961 and launches resumed that May 1961. 576B-1 began operation in 1960 and hosted five missile tests until 1965, when it hosted Nike-Zeus and reentry vehicle tests. The pad was decommissioned in 1966. 576B-2 hosted Atlas D ICBM tests from 1960 to 1963, then it supported Nike-Zeus and reentry vehicle tests. The pad was decommissioned in 1967. 576B-3 hosted Atlas D ICBM tests from 1960 to 1963, then it supported reentry vehicle and OV-1 satellite launches. The pad was decommissioned in 1967.  576C  Pad 576C was only used for three Atlas E tests in 1963.  576D  Pad 576D was only used for two Atlas F tests in 1963-1964.  576E  At complex 576E, a crane lifts Stage 0 of the Taurus XL launch vehicle for the Orbiting Carbon Observatory from its transporter. Pad 576E was used for four Atlas F tests in 1962-1964. Since 1994, the facility was revived for Minotaur-C and Pegasus launches.

His Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica is considered to be one of the most influential book in the history of science, laying the groundwork for most of classical mechanics by describing universal gravitation and the three laws of motion. In mathematics, Newton shares the credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the development of the differential and integral calculus. Because of the resounding impact of his work, Newton became a scientific icon, much like Albert Einstein after his theory of relativity. Many books, plays, and films focus on Newton or use Newton as a literary device. Newton's stature among scientists remains at the very top rank, as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of scientists in Britain's Royal Society (formerly headed by Newton) asking who had the greater effect on the history of science, Newton or Albert Einstein. Newton was deemed the more influential. In 1999, leading physicists voted Albert Einstein \\"greatest physicist ever\\"; Newton was the runner-up.  Visual arts  * William Blake created a colour copper engraving entitled Newton, in 1795.Isaac Newton, Blake, William, Web Gallery of Art The engraving would serve as the basis for bronze statue Newton, made in 1995 by the sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi.  Poetry  Newton, located in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge English poet Alexander Pope was moved by Newton's accomplishments to write the famous epitaph:http://www.bartleby.com/297/154.html > Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night; > God said \\"Let Newton be\\" and all was light. English poet J. C. Squire satirised this:http://izquotes.com/quote/268818 > It could not last; the Devil shouting \\"Ho! > Let Einstein be!\\" restored the status quo. The following passage is from William Wordsworth's The Prelude, in which he describes a marble statue of Newton at Trinity College, Cambridge: > And from my pillow, looking forth by light > Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold > The antechapel where the statue stood > Of Newton with his prism and silent face, > The marble index of a mind for ever > Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone. * Jerusalem: The Emanation of the Giant Albion, William Blake * A Poem Sacred to the Memory of Sir Isaac Newton, James Thomson * The Movement of Bodies, Sheenagh Pugh  Literature   Books about Newton  * * *  Books featuring Newton as a character  * Newton and his alchemical experiments play a central role in the 2012 young adult novels The Prince of Soul and The Lighthouse by Fredrik Broun√©us. * Isaac Newton plays a significant role in The Age of Unreason, a series of four alternate history novels written by American science fiction and fantasy author Gregory Keyes. * Newton is an important character in The Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson.

Newton's interest in alchemy and the dispute over the discovery of calculus are prominent plot points, and there is a (fictional) debate on metaphysics between Newton and Gottfried Leibniz moderated by Caroline of Ansbach. The development of an economy based on money and credit is also a major theme, with Newton's time with the Royal Mint and intrigues against counterfeit leading to a Trial of the Pyx. * Newton is a recurring character in Gotlib's Rubrique-√†-Brac series of comics, where he repeatedly discovers gravity or randomly bizarre laws after being (often very heavily) hit on the head by various objects, including the famous apple. * Newton is the protagonist of the 2002 Philip Kerr novel Dark Matter, set during the Great Recoinage. * Newton is a major character in Michael White's 2006 novel Equinox. * 'Sir Isaac Newton' is a newt in The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher by Beatrix Potter. * The 2017 novel A Dragon's Guide to Making Your Human Smarter by Laurence Yep features Newton as a character, having lived to the present day due to finding the Philosopher's Stone.

Newtonmas  Some atheists, sceptics, and others have referred to 25 December as Newtonmas, a tongue-in-cheek reference to Christmas. Celebrants send cards with \\"Reason's Greetings!\\" printed inside, and exchange boxes of apples and science-related items as gifts. The celebration may have had its origin in a meeting of the Newton Association at Christmas 1890 to talk, distribute gifts, and share laughter and good cheer. The name Newtonmas can be attributed to The Skeptics Society, which needed an alternative name for its Christmas party. Another name for this holiday is Gravmas (also spelt Gravmass or Grav-mass) which is an abbreviation of \\"gravitational mass\\" due to Newton's Theory of Gravitation. On 25 December 2014, American astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson tweeted: In a subsequent interview, Tyson denied being \\"anti-Christian\\", noting that Jesus' true birthdate is unknown. Newton's birthday was 25 December under the Old Style Julian Calendar used in Protestant England at the time, but was 4 January under the New Style Gregorian Calendar used simultaneously in Catholic Europe. The period between has been proposed for a holiday season called \\"10 Days of Newton\\" to commemorate this.

Instances where this slope fails resulting in a rock or earthfall can result in loss of life, injuries and damage or destruction of equipment (see mining). It has been found that, over the last few hours preceding a slope failure, there is nearly always a small movement, or alteration in the movement pattern in the rock face of that section. The system is intended to monitor mine slopes to detect this movement and generate a warning of impending failure (slope stability), so that personnel and equipment may be removed prior to the failure. The radar element provides very accurate, real-time, all weather slope movement measurements with sub millimetre detection ability, and is able to provide an alarm if the detected movement reaches a predetermined level, thereby permitting evacuation of the unstable area, and enhancing safety. All radar measurements are fully geo-referenced to an accuracy that allows easy integration with standard digital terrain mapping (DTM) tools. A second function of the Movement and Surveying Radar is to determine the absolute range to the electromagnetic reflective centroid of an area on a body of material or geographical feature. This functionality, combined with the accurately surveyed position of the measurement origin of the Movement and Surveying Radar and the positioning system‚Äôs angular measurement information, may be used to generate survey data of geographical features such as mine walls and rubble dumps. The survey data collected may be used for applications such as the calculation of material removal volumes. A Movement and Surveying Radar combines simultaneously the execution of slope stability and surveying measurements, which together with high-speed external data links makes it a near real-time tool for mining safety, planning and productivity improvement.

Her husband is from a Norwegian family, so she wrote The Trickster and the Troll to bring together the two cultures of her children, for them and for her grandchildren. The story follows the Lakota trickster Iktomi and a Norwegian house troll across the plains as they search for the troll's lost family. Sneve was an English language teacher and counselor in several public schools, editor at the Brevet Press in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and she has been a member of several organizations. She and her husband also ran an antiques business before retiring. She still writes today; her latest book is \\"The Christmas Coat: Memories of My Sioux Childhood\\", published in 2011 and named in the Smithsonian magazine's Best Children's Books of 2011.

Will Save Us All included four of the five singles released by the group since 1998 and combined cover songs such as \\"Warm Leatherette\\" and \\"Mind Your Own Business\\" and original songs. COS' cover of Malaria!'s \\"Kaltes Klares Wasser\\" was a subsequent single. COS collaborated with a diverse range of producers and DJs from the German techno scene to create the album. The album was well received by critics, who praised in particular the reinterpretations of various 80s songs and the strength of COS' original compositions such as \\"Glamour Girl\\" and \\"Little Star\\" and took note of the implications of the group's politics that were largely manifested through a deliberate emphasis on style over substance in terms of both music and image.

On October 16, 2009, he was arrested by the FBI for insider trading, which also caused the Galleon Group to fold. He stood trial in U.S. v Rajaratnam (09 Cr. 01184) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and on May 11, 2011, was found guilty on all 14 counts of conspiracy and securities fraud. On October 13, 2011, Rajaratnam was sentenced to 11 years in prison and fined a criminal and civil penalty of over $150 million combined. Rajaratnam was incarcerated at Federal Medical Center, Devens in Ayer, Massachusetts, an administrative facility housing male offenders requiring specialized or long-term medical or mental health care. Rajaratnam was released to home confinement in his Upper East Side Manhattan apartment, located on Sutton Place, in the summer of 2019. Background and career Rajaratnam is an ethnic Sri Lankan Tamil born in Colombo in what was then the Dominion of Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka). His wealthy father, J. M. Rajaratnam, was the head of the Singer Sewing Machine Co. in South Asia.Mehta, Suketu, \\"The Outsider: In an exclusive interview, Raj Rajaratnam reveals ...\\", The Daily Beast, October 23, 2011; retrieved 2011-10-26. He attended S. Thomas' Preparatory School, Kollupitiya before his family migrated to England. Rajaratnam's family emigrated to England in 1971, concerned that the post-independence Sri Lankan ethnic violence against the Tamils would get more violent.Mehta, Suketu. \\"The Outsider\\", Newsweek 158.18 (2011): 46‚Äì51.

Retrieved on 2013-07-18. and later studied engineering at the University of Sussex, and then earned an M.B.A. from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1983. Rajaratnam started his career as a lending officer at Chase Manhattan Bank where he specialized in business loans to technology companies. He joined the investment banking boutique Needham & Co. as an analyst in 1985, where he focused on the consumer electronics industry. He rapidly rose through the ranks, becoming the head of research in 1987 and the president in 1991, at the age of 34. At the company's behest, he started a hedge fund‚Äîthe Needham Emerging Growth Partnership‚Äîin March 1992, which he later bought and renamed Galleon Group. His hedge fund was valued at $3.7 billion in 2009, down from a peak of $7 billion in 2008. According to a 2009 investor letter his $1.2 billion Diversified Fund had a net annualized return of 22.3 percent. Rajaratnam has been featured among the elite US money managers in a book called The New Investment Superstars. Initially, he primarily invested in technology and healthcare companies. He said that his best ideas came from frequent visits with the companies in which he invested and from conversations with executives who invested in his fund.Lois Peltz, The New Investment Superstars, Wiley, 2001; After Rajaratnam's arrest, Galleon received requests from its investors for the withdrawal of $1.3 billion, which caused the fund to close. In a letter dated October 21, 2009, Rajaratnam informed his employees and investors that he intended to wind down all the funds of the Galleon Group. Investors received the full balance of their initial investments, plus profits, in January 2010. Contributions to charitable and political organizations In November 2009, Rajaratnam pledged to donate $1 million to help with the rehabilitation of the LTTE combatants. He donated to clear land mines in the war-affected areas in Sri Lanka. He recalled his visits to the mine-impacted areas of Sri Lanka and underscored the humanitarian toll that mines have taken. Recalling his encounter with a young child in Kilinochchi who had lost both legs to a land mine, Rajaratnam stated that this particular image that is etched in his memory \\"made it an easy decision to write the check.\\" He helped Sri Lankans recover after the 2004 tsunami. Rajaratnam was also a contributor to various causes that promoted development in the Indian subcontinent and programs that benefited low income South Asian youth in the New York area. According to the Federal Election Commission, Rajaratnam has made over $118,000 in political contributions in five years. He contributed to the Democratic National Committee and various campaigns on behalf of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Charles Schumer, and Robert Menendez. Controversy Rajaratnam contributed $3.5 million to the Tamils Rehabilitation Organisation (TRO), a group whose assets were frozen by the USA due to its close connections to the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) which are proscribed as a terrorist organization in 32 countries. TRO's offices were raided by the FBI in 2006 but the organization was never charged with any wrongdoing.Officials Say Investor's Donations Wound Up With Sri Lanka Rebels, The Wall Street Journal, October 19, 2009. The Sri Lankan government stated that Rajaratnam had contributed for several years of the Sri Lankan Civil War to the LTTE with millions of dollars and that, as a consequence, he was under investigation in Sri Lanka.James Fontanella-Khan. Financial Times.com 'Sri Lanka claims Rajaratnam gave Tamil Tigers ‚Äòmillions‚Äô', ft.com, October 18, 2009. However, the senior military official could not give specific details about the contributions to the LTTE. Rajaratnam had recently pledged a $1 million to rehabilitate former LTTE combatants. Conviction and imprisonment for insider trading :Additional context at Raj Rajaratnam/Galleon Group, Anil Kumar, and Rajat Gupta insider trading cases On Friday October 16, 2009, Raj Rajaratnam was arrested by the FBI for insider trading in the stock of several publicly traded companies. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara put the total profits in the scheme at over $60 million, telling a news conference that it was the largest hedge fund insider trading case in United States history. Jim Walden, an attorney for Rajaratnam, said his client is innocent and would fight the insider-trading charges. Rajaratnam profited from information received from: * Robert Moffat, a senior executive of IBM, considered next in line to be CEO. * Anil Kumar, a senior executive of McKinsey & Company, and close friend of Rajat Gupta (its former managing director) who was later also convicted of passing information to Rajaratnam. * Rajiv Goel, a midlevel Intel Capital executive. * Roomy Khan, previously convicted of wire fraud for providing inside information from her employer, Intel, to Rajaratnam.USDC NDCA case no. 5:01-cr-20029-JW USA v. Khan It was reported that Rajaratnam, Goel, and Kumar were all part of the class of 1983 from Wharton business school. The Sri Lankan stock market fell sharply after Rajaratnam was arrested on insider trading charges in October 2009. Sri Lanka's Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing the active stock trading of Raj Rajaratnam with a view of identifying any insider trading. Rajaratnam also conspired to get confidential information on the $5 billion purchase by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway of Goldman preferred stock prior to the September 2008 public announcement of that transaction. The Wall Street Journal reported that a former member of the board of directors of Goldman Sachs and former McKinsey & Company chief executive Rajat Gupta told Rajaratnam about Berkshire's investment before it became public. Gupta stood to profit as would-be chairman of Galleon International, a co-founder of New Silk Route with Rajaratnam, and as a friend of Rajaratnam. In March 2011 Gupta was charged in an administrative proceeding by the SEC. Gupta maintained his innocence, counter-sued, and won dismissal of the administrative charge, but was then arrested on criminal charges. On May 11, 2011, Rajaratnam was found guilty on all 14 counts of conspiracy and securities fraud. On October 13, 2011, Rajaratnam was sentenced to 11 years in prison by Judge Richard Holwell. To date, this was the longest prison sentence ever handed out for insider trading. The thirteen other defendants connected to Rajaratnam's case received prison sentences averaging approximately three years each. Rajaratnam served the first years of his 11-year sentence in Ayer, Massachusetts.Jeffrey, Don, \\"Rajat Gupta Lawsuit Dismissal Opposed by Goldman Investor\\", Bloomberg, December 7, 2011; retrieved 2011-12-18. His appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was argued in October 2012 by Patricia Millett, who subsequently became a federal Court of Appeals judge herself on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on December 10, 2013.https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/millett-patricia-ann Updates U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan on March 3, 2017, rejected Rajaratnam's bid to void much of his insider trading conviction and shorten his 11-year prison sentence, on account of Rajaratnam failing to show his actual innocence on five of the 14 counts on which he was convicted, or that two other counts should be vacated because the main government witness committed perjury. Preska also rejected Rajaratnam's argument that his trial counsel was ineffective, and denied Rajaratnam's bid to reduce the $53.8 million he agreed to forfeit to about $4.3 million. Prosecutors said Rajaratnam made up to $63.8 million from 2003 to 2009 through insider trading in stocks such as eBay, Goldman Sachs, and Google. Rajaratnam was convicted in May 2011 on nine counts of securities fraud and five counts of conspiracy. He has served 8 years in prison and is eligible for release in July 2021. See also * SEC v.

In the 21st century, he became a pop culture journalist-historian, and celebrity biographer. Early life Porter was the son of Hazel Lee Phillips, a fashion designer, and Paul Suggs, an attorney. His stepfather, Numie Rowan Porter, adopted him and changed his last name. He grew up in Western North Carolina, moving to Miami Beach when he was ten years old. His mother was the wardrobe mistress and secretary for the renowned entertainer, Sophie Tucker. As a young boy in Tucker's home, Porter first met many of the stars he would later write about ‚Äî Marilyn Monroe, Ronald Reagan, Victor Mature, Richard Widmark, Frank Sinatra, and Elizabeth Taylor, plus an array of other stars. He attended the University of Miami, graduating in 1959. He was the editor of the award-winning student newspaper, The Miami Hurricane, and the President of the Florida Intercollegiate Press Association. As a student journalist, he obtained major interviews most notably with Eleanor Roosevelt. She befriended him and was instrumental in recommending him for a scholarship. He did interviews with Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, along with Tallulah Bankhead, Ted Williams, Bette Davis, Ethel Merman, Adlai Stevenson, and Vice President Richard M. Nixon. Career In 1958, he joined The Miami Herald as an entertainment writer, book reviewer, and columnist. Later, he was appointed Bureau Chief of The Miami Herald in Key West, where he was a frequent visitor to Havana, writing about the growing tensions between the United States and Cuba. Once, he was taken into the hills to meet a guerilla fighter, Fidel Castro. In Key West, he conducted extensive interviews with Harry S Truman, who had made Key West his winter White House during his presidency. In Key West, he was befriended by playwright Tennessee Williams, who introduced him to a number of stars, such as Vivien Leigh, Marlon Brando, and Paul Newman, as well as such literary figures as Truman Capote, Christopher Isherwood, and Gore Vidal. Porter would later write biographies of these personalities. In 2014, he would publish a biography, Pink Triangle, devoted to Williams, Capote, and Vidal. In New York in 1961, Porter was named vice president of Haggart Associates at the age of 24. Working with the company president, Stanley Mills Haggart, a noted interior designer, author, and magazine editor, they produced some of TV's most watched commercials, specializing in hiring movie stars to sell their products. Haggart had the Pepsi-Cola account, the soft drink promoted by Joan Crawford. They also produced 20-minute musical shorts starring such entertainers as Lena Horne and Louis Armstrong. A world traveler, Porter, in 1969, wrote the first ever Frommer guidebook. (Before that, the series produced a $-a-Day series.) In terms of volume, he would write more travel guidebooks than all others, over a 50-year span. In the 1970s and 80s, and into the 90s, the Frommer guidebook series was the market leader. They books were published, over the years, by Arthur Frommer, Inc.; Simon & Schuster; and John Wiley & Sons. Porter also wrote and updated subsequent editions of travel guides for Lufthansa, American Airlines, TWA, Iberia Airlines, Greyhound, British Airways, SAS Scandinavian Airlines, American Express, TAP Air Portugal, Air France, and Alitalia. Porter is also a novelist. His first novel Butterflies in Heat was reviewed by James Kirkwood, Jr., the Pulitzer prize-winning author of A Chorus Line, with ‚ÄúDarwin Porter writes with an incredible understanding of the milieu‚Äîhot enough to singe the wings off any butterfly.‚Äù Butterflies in Heat was later adapted into the film, Tropic of Desire. Other novels include Marika, based in part on information gleaned from Porter's long association with German and Austrian stars such as Hedy Lamarr, Marlene Dietrich, and Greta Keller, the leading chanteuse of Europe during the 1930s. He also wrote Venus, a novel suggested by the life of the acclaimed diarist, Ana√Øs Nin. Other novels include Blood Moon, Hollywood‚Äôs Silent Closet, Razzle-Dazzle, Midnight in Savannah, and Rhinestone Country. In the 21st Century, for Blood Moon Productions, Porter has produced more Hollywood celebrity biographies than any other journalist, concentrating on legendary stars and personalities such as Marilyn Monroe, Howard Hughes, Elizabeth Taylor, Vivien Leigh, Laurence Olivier, Humphrey Bogart, Steve McQueen, Marlon Brando, Katharine Hepburn, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Peter O'Toole, Rock Hudson, Debbie Reynolds and her daughter Carrie Fisher, and Linda Lovelace. He has written biographies of singers Michael Jackson, Merv Griffin, Frank Sinatra, and biographies based on politicians‚ÄîJ. Edgar Hoover, Bill & Hillary Clinton, Ronald & Nancy Reagan, Donald Trump, and The Kennedys. Porter is also the author of four books on film criticism and has written a series of expos√©s as part of Blood Moon's Hollywood Babylon series. These biographies, based on compilation of firsthand, orally transmitted histories, have illuminated aspects of Hollywood history previously unknown to the general public. Some of Porter's works have been serialized by major broadsheet newspapers in the U.K., including The Mail on Sunday. The Sunday Times (London) defined Porter's biography of Marlon Brando (Brando Unzipped) as ‚ÄúLurid, raunchy, perceptive, and certainly worth reading‚Ä¶One of the ten best show-biz biographies of the year.‚Äù As a biographer, Porter has won numerous awards from, among others, the New England Book Festival, the Hollywood Book Festival, the Los Angeles Book Festival, the New York Book Festival, The Northern and Southern California Book Festivals, The Florida Book Festival, the San Francisco Book Festival, and the Beach Book Festival. His biographies and travel guides have been translated into many languages, including French, Italian, Dutch, German, Portuguese, Spanish, and Chinese. Most of his biographies were published by Blood Moon Productions (www.BloodMoonProductions.com), a New York City-based press directed by former New York Times reporter Danforth Prince, and distributed through the National Book Network (www.NBNbooks.com) Blood Moon originated as the Georgia Literary Association in 1997, adopting its current name in 2004.  Criticism  According to \\"Paul Bellini at FAB Magazine\\", I love the Porter/Prince books. They are the biographies I dreamed about as a child. Bill & Hillary is amazing and fascinating, the story of a young lawyer with intense ambition, who met a young man with the same intense ambition, and how they both maintained political careers while surviving scandal after scandal. There's all the regular stuff, like the impact of Monica Lewinsky and the embarrassment it caused, and there is also the Vince Foster story...which reads like a great, tragic, doomed love story, one that changed Hillary forever. ‚ÄúBill & Hillary brims with Washington gossip of the era, like when teenage Laura Bush ran over and killed her ex-boyfriend, or the fact that the White House hid Reagan‚Äôs Alzheimer‚Äôs so that he could finish his second term with dignity, even if he didn‚Äôt know where he was. The Clintons are a modern political dynasty, like kings and queens of yore. Bill & Hillary, So This Is That Thing Called Love is the story of how his charm, and her ability to command respect have kept them in the political eye for over 25 years. Hillary ran for the Democratic candidacy before, and lost to Obama, but this time she‚Äôs ready. Even if she doesn‚Äôt win, she has earned her place in history, not just as a First Lady, but as a political legend.‚Äù Paul Bellini, Bellini‚Äôs 8 1/2, FAB Magazine, Toronto from \\"The Midwest Book Review\\": ‚Äú'James Dean: Tomorrow Never Comes' arrives on the 60th anniversary of the violent death of a young star that became a legend, but if readers who are prior fans of other James Dean biographies expect this to be another rehash of information, they'd be happily mistaken. Much of its information has never been published before, because it offers new unauthorized details, uncensored information, and also includes powerful, in-depth analysis of a supporting cast of contemporaries. Insights from a closeted TV producer who first discovered James Dean, and others who interacted with him and often suffered from his mental swings and murky sexual explorations add to and expand the existing popular literature on this icon. From Dean's early TV career and his involvements with other actors and actresses to the truths about his sexual liaisons, the parade of women who marched into and out of his life, and his frustrations in the industry, James Dean: Tomorrow Never Comes makes for a vivid read especially recommended for prior fans of Dean's life and times. Be forewarned: this audience shouldn't expect a light coverage. The in-depth survey, with its amazingly large cast of contemporaries and characters, myths refuted and realities explored, and high- octane drama packs in over seven hundred pages of detail, which may look daunting, but which offer a rollicking good read. With so many facts and insights packing its pages, James Dean: Tomorrow Never Comes is a highly recommended book for any who would uncover more facets of the life and times of James Dean. Senior Reviewer Diane Donovan, The Midwest Book Review and California Bookwatch. From \\"Films in Review\\", re \\"LOVE TRIANGLE: Ronald Reagan, Jane Wyman, & Nancy Davis\\" It has to be a reflection of modern technological advances, it can‚Äôt be anything else: all the Blood Moon books, most of them several hundred pages in length, are written by the same two people ‚Äì Porter & Prince. I mean, how is that possible? Each book should have taken two years. Well, it must be something to do with the ease of writing with WORD, combined with the extraordinarily easy access to information on the internet. I‚Äôve never seen a more thorough use of these modern breakthroughs than here. And while the book has the feeling, at times, of collage, it's never any less than fun, and it's infinitely more substantial than a mere gossip tome. I mean, I loved Kenneth Anger's Hollywood Babylon books (I had the pleasure of putting him up at my apt for a few days once, and that was fun, too), but they (and this, at first glance) are nothing more than gossip. However, in their cumulative, lurid glow, like Weejee's LA photos, the O‚ÄôToole bio becomes something more than what is on the surface ‚Äì much, more, certainly than what Anger gave us. O‚ÄôTOOLE takes itself a level more seriously than gossip, and its text is informative, both about the British stage and the American screen. In terms of glorious gossip, however, wait till you get (just as an example) to page 126. O‚ÄôToole is invited by Jules Buck, his friend and business partner, to join him for drinks with two other friends, who turn out to be Ava Gardner (they meet in her suite at the Savoy Hotel in London) and Burt Lancaster, neither of whom O‚ÄôToole had previously met, and both of whom had acted together in Robert Siodmak's THE KILLERS. Their unexpurgated stories that evening are absolute jaw-droppers. Lancaster's bi-sexuality and Gardner's sexual appetites are tossed away like everyday, casual knowledge. Their fast- flowing repartee and awareness of each other's sexual adventures pile on, paragraph after paragraph, story after story, and it's heady stuff. Add in some bizarre here-say out of nowhere about Evita Peron, and it's a kinetic, wonderfully written chapter. And there are plenty more to follow. I mentioned this book to FIR's quirky film critic, Victoria Alexander, and after reading it she ordered the one on Elizabeth Taylor and said it was just as good. Blood Moon has found a winning formula. Roy Frumkes in FILMS IN REVIEW, http://69.195.124.61/~filmsinr/2015/12/20/christmas-column-2015/ From the Midwest Book Review: ‚ÄúLove Triangle: Ronald Reagan, Jane Wyman & Nancy Davis may find its way onto many a Republican Reagan fan's reading shelf; but those who expect another Reagan celebration will be surprised: this is lurid Hollywood expose writing at its best, and outlines the truths surrounding one of the most provocative industry scandals in the world. ‚ÄúThere are already so many biographies of the Reagans on the market that one might expect similar mile-markers from this: be prepared for shock and awe; because Love Triangle doesn't take your ordinary approach to biography and describes a love triangle that eventually bumped a major Hollywood movie star from the possibility of being First Lady and replaced her with a lesser-known Grade B actress (Nancy Davis). ‚ÄúFrom politics and betrayal to romance, infidelity, and sordid affairs, Love Triangle is a steamy, eye-opening story that blows the lid off of the Reagan illusion to raise eyebrows on both sides of the big screen. ‚ÄúBlack and white photos liberally pepper an account of the careers of all three and the lasting shock of their stormy relationships in a delightful pursuit especially recommended for any who relish Hollywood gossip.‚Äù Diane Donovan, Senior Reviewer, California Bookwatch section of the Midwest Book Review.

He owned a hotel and livery on Adelaide Street near Toronto's St. Lawrence market, where many farmers would stay while in town selling their produce. James Mink, the son of Johan Herkimer's slave named Mink, became a millionaire, as did his brother, George. He had a hotel, livery and coach service in Toronto, while his brother was located in Kingston, Ontario in the 1840s to 1860s. Both brothers started the first public transit system in their respective cities, James from the Town of Yorkville to the St. Lawrence market in downtown Toronto. He married a white Irish immigrant, Elizabeth. James and Elizabeth had a daughter, Mary, and possibly some other children. It was customary to offer a dowry for a daughter, and so James Mink offered a large dowry for his daughter's hand and there's evidence of his advertisements. It is believed that a businessman named William Johnson accepted the dowry, married the daughter, and took her on a honeymoon to the United States. However, after the wedding, Johnson revealed himself to be a slave trader and sold Mary into slavery on a Virginia tobacco plantation. In the fictional movie, Mink pretended to be his wife's slave, traveled to the American South and successfully rescued Mary and several other slaves, but that is not true. Archives reveal that it is more likely that he got the British government officials to buy her back and return her home, where the census reveals lived at his home on the Don and Danforth Road between Pape and Carlaw Streets. Mink's story was told in the movie Captive Heart: The James Mink Story, starring Lou Gossett, Jr. as James Mink and Kate Nelligan as his wife.

It centered at the coast of the Bay of Gdansk (Danzig) and Vistula Lagoon (Frisches Haff) and extended north to the Curonian Lagoon and up to ≈†ventoji settlement in Lithuania. It is either named after the adjacent bays, or after an archeological site in the village of Rzucewo (Rutzau) near Puck. The Rzucewo culture was a hybrid of pre-Indo- European Narva culture, Globular Amphora culture and Corded Ware culture. Traditionally Rzucewo was identified as a variation of Corded Ware culture; however newest research suggests that the culture formed before Corded Ware. This culture specialized in exploitation of marine resources, and existed in parallel to its mother culture for some time. Rzucewo settlements, consisting of characteristic houses reinforced against sea erosion, were located along the coast and further east. The Rzucewo people had domesticated cattle, pigs, some goats, but did little cultivation and engaged in fishery and hunting, especially of seals, then numerous along the Baltic coast. The Rzucewo culture people produced and widely traded amber decorative items in specialist shops. A large number of amber artifacts was found in Juodkrantƒó. Formerly, this culture was interpreted as the earliest detection of the Balts. Tracing formation of the Balts to Rzucewo culture could explain differences between Western and Eastern Balts and their languages (and possibly a stage of West Baltic‚ÄìPre-Slavic unity; see Balto-Slavic languages), though linguistic conclusions based on this methodology are controversial and tentative at best, ad hoc at worst. Typically Polish and German archeologists place the culture just on the coast, while Lithuanian and Latvian scientists extend it much further inland describing coastal settlements as a cultural and economic center and inland villages as a periphery.

Life Marin le Bourgeoys was born into a noted artisan family in Lisieux, in Normandy, France. He was probably initially trained as a painter. He later attained fame not only as an artist, but as a gunsmith, inventor, and luthier. In 1598, his talents attracted King Henry IV, and he was appointed Valet de Chambre in the Royal Court. In 1608, he was granted rooms in the Grand Gallery of the Louvre. He produced artwork, firearms, air guns, crossbows, and movable globes. He continued in royal service under the reign of King Louis XIII. Sometime between 1610 and 1615 it is believed that he created the first \\"true\\" flintlock ignited firearm, which was an improvement on earlier flintlock systems. One feature of Marin le Bourgeoys' lock was that it had a half cocked position, from which the weapon could be loaded but would not fire. This feature proved to be much safer than earlier designs, and was widely implemented as other gunsmiths copied the flintlock. His basic design was copied and soon spread over all of Europe and was standard in firearm use until the 1840s, when it was finally replaced by percussion lock systems. His weapons were considered works of art, and Louis XIII kept many of them in a private collection. The King also gave them to favored courtiers and highly esteemed visitors. \\"Equestrian Portrait of Henri IV in armor in Front of a City\\" by Marin Le Bourgeoys References * \\"Pistols: An Illustrated History of Their Impact\\" By Jeff Kinard, Published by ABC-CLIO, 2004 * \\"The Flintlock: Its Origin, Development, and Use\\" By Torsten Lenk Category:Gunsmiths Category:French inventors Category:1550s births Category:1634 deaths ","title":"Marin le Bourgeoys"},{"id":"21605268","text":"Josef \\"Pepi\\" Stroh (5 March 1913 ‚Äì 7 January 1991) was an Austrian footballer and football manager.

She has won several awards such as the Premio Fernando Lara de Novela in 2019 (Fernando Lara Novel Award), the Planeta-Casa de Am√©rica Award (Premio Planeta - Casa de Am√©rica) in 2009, the Azor√≠n Prize (Premio Azor√≠n) in 2005 and four Chicago Latin Literary Awards, as well as the Premio Iberoamericano Planeta- Casa de Am√©rica de Narrativa. Her works have been translated into 23 languages and published in more than 50 countries. She is one of the most widely read Spanish-speaking authors, the most read Colombian writer after Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, and considered the creator of the Magical Idealism.  First steps, life and years as a publicist  Born in the Colombian city of Cali, she is the daughter of Marco Tulio Becerra and Cilia Acevedo, the fifth of seven children -5 women and 2 men. She read her first book when she was only 6, Peter and Wendy by J.M. Barrie, determining her fascination for literature. A combination of observation, silence and imagination led Becerra to write at an early age her first stories in which she created other worlds. Throughout her adolescence she writes many poems that later will be part of his collection Alma Abierta (Open Soul). At 17 she married Humberto Tellez. The result of this union is her first daughter √Ångela (Cali, 1980). Once married Becerra begins Economics, career that she abandons in order to pursue Communication and Advertising Design from which she graduated with honors in 1982. By that time, she was serving as Creative Director at a major international advertising agency. In 1987, and after she is divorced, Becerra moved to Bogota where she continued her successful advertising career earning numerous awards for her creative work. In 1988, after meeting the advertiser and writer Joaqu√≠n Lorente -who will become her husband and the father of her second daughter Mar√≠a (Barcelona 1993)-, Becerra traveled to Barcelona and for thirteen years hold the Creative Vice Presidency of one of the most important advertising agencies Spain. In 2000, amidst her professional success, she abandoned her career as a publicist in order to devote herself entirely to her deepest passion: writing.  Her work  Her first published work was Alma Abierta (Open Soul) (Planeta Group, 2001), a beautiful collection of poems that deals with the conflicts of the human being in maturity. De los amores negados (Of Useless Loves) (2003), her first published novel (Villegas Editores 2003, Grupo Planeta 2004), marks the beginning of a very personal style described by literary critics as Magic Idealism. This is a story set in the imaginary city of Garmendia del Viento, where time seems to accompany the anxieties of Fiamma and Martin. This work received a warm reception from critics and readers in both Spain and Latin America, obtaining the Chicago Latin American Literary Award for Best Sentimental Novel. The work that established her as a great novelist is El Pen√∫ltimo sue√±o (The Penultimate Dream) (Planeta Group 2005, Villegas Editores, 2005), an immense love story that overcomes every obstacle. The story takes place between Barcelona and Cannes, where Joan and Soledad fall in love as teenagers. Throughout its pages, the two characters live a lengthy dream with a surprising ending.

In 2008, Becerra published Amor con A (Villegas Editores) in Colombia, a collection of poems printed in a limited edition that gathers the beginning, life and death of love. Ella que todo lo tuvo (She, who had it all) (Planeta Group, 2009), a psychological novel, is the story of a writer who suffers an accident and never writes again. In her intention to feel alive again, the writer creates an enigmatic character, a Donna di l√°grima, a silent woman adored by men. No one will recognize her as the sad and lonely writer who restores old books in Florence and falls in love with a mysterious book keeper. This book got the Planeta-Casa de America Award in 2009. In 2013 Becerra published Memorias de un sinverg√ºenza de siete suelas (Memoires of a Seven Soles Scoundrel) (Planeta Group), a novel full of emotional contrasts set in the most glamorous and traditional Seville. It is the story of Francisco Valiente, a casanova of the 21st century who dies suddenly. During his funeral, his wife and his lover will tell his scattered life; what they do not know is that the dead is also listening and will have much to say in that funeral. Her most recent novel Alg√∫n d√≠a, hoy (Someday, today) (Planeta Group, 2019), is based on a real event that took place in 1920 in Colombia, and in which she tells the story of Betsab√© Espinal, who at the age of twenty-three becomes the heroine of one of the first feminist strikes in history.

Biography and career Born in Misamis Oriental in 1945 to Jose Monreal Lacaba of Loon, Bohol and Fe Flores from Pateros, Rizal, he is one of the leading figures in Philippine literature today. He is well known in various fields, including creative writing, journalism, editing and scriptwriting. Lacaba was recognized for his coverage of the First Quarter Storm, an anti-Marcos movement, in 1970. During martial law, Lacaba fought President Ferdinand Marcos and his US-backed military dictatorship. Under the nom de plume Ruben Cuevas, Lacaba published his poem \\"Prometheus Unbound\\" at Focus, a magazine that had allied itself with the Marcos regime. His poetry collections include Ang Mga Kagilagilalas na Pakikipagsapalaran ni Juan de la Cruz (1979), Sa Daigdig ng Kontradiksyon (1991) and Sa Panahon ng Ligalig (1991). A new edition of his important, highly charged Days of Disquiet, Nights of Rage (1982), a reportage on the First Quarter Storm and the subsequent times, has also been released. He worked with well-known directors like Lino Brocka and Mike de Leon in producing films that expose ordinary people's lives that experienced poverty and injustice. He continued writing poems, and in 1999, was decorated as one of 100 \\"Bayani ng Sining\\". Lacaba is currently the executive editor of Summit Media's YES! magazine, the sister publication of PEP. His screenplay credits include Jaguar, which competed at the Cannes International Film Festival in 1980, while Bayan Ko: Kapit sa Patalim competed in 1984. Orapronobis was screened out of competition in 1989. Ricky Lee co-wrote Jaguar with Lacaba.

According to Anima Aguiluz, the daughter of Direk Tikoy and festival programmer of Cinemanila, Bayan Ko could be found in Toronto, Canada.

Plot Apprentice sorcery students, Kokuyo and Harika, require contact with an obsidian orb to effectively use their yin-yang magic. Due to this disadvantage, they are considered inferior to \\"normal\\" sorcery students. Discouraged by his status, Kokuyo often skips his teacher and adopter, Sekiei's class to show off his magical skills on the street. Harika, on the other hand, is studious and often has to drag Kokuyo back to class. Kokuyo's rival, Nekome, a third-level sorcerer, arrives to taunt Kokuyo about his obsidian status and to insult Sekiei for adopting an obsidian baby and attempt to train him into a sorcerer. When Harika slaps him for doing so, Nekome tries to gain Harika's affections although she is oblivious to his attempts. Kokuyo and Harika work together in the third-level sorcery exam to inadvertently defeat a first-level monster and pass the exam spectacularly.

The underlying premise of the procedure is that the economy has a long run trajectory which is perturbed by various frictions. These are called wedges and the earliest version of the procedure includes a productivity wedge, a labor wedge, an investment wedge and a government consumption wedge. Business cycle accounting decomposes fluctuations in macroeconomic variables, such as GDP or employment, into fluctuations of each of these wedges (and their combinations).
