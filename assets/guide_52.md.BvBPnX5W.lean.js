Early Life  Waldron was born in Wollongong in New South Wales to Alfred Adolphus and Sarah Waldron, and, although the precise date of his birth was not recorded, he was baptised on 28 January 1874. On 5 July 1899, at the age of 26 and now living around Woollahra, he married his first wife, Clarence Vere Deniehy, who died in 1932. Following her death, and now 60 years old, Waldron married Elizabeth Tibbetts who also died in 1935; forming a huge part of his desire to travel throughout Central Australia.  Life in the Northern Territory  Waldron began prospecting around Central Australia in 1935, presumably after his second wife's death, in many trackless places and he was a well-known eccentric \\"even in a land of queer people\\". He was known everywhere in the outback as \\"The Professor\\" but, although he did spend time at the University of Sydney, there appears to be no justification for the title. It is said that he appeared to be a man of substantial means and that it was not known how he financed his numerous expeditions, but it was his aim to find a new, rich, goldfield in Australia. Waldron said that he was led by the spirit of his dead wife who led him when he was wandering in the desert and that she appeared to him every night when he held a s√©ance to commune with her. It was this spirit that told Waldron not to stay at Moonlight Rockhole, a goldfield he found in 1935, and instead he continued to the already 'discovered The Granites goldfield. When camped 80 kilometres from The Granites Waldron, and his teams, camp was destroyed in a fire (including all food supplies) and, rather than return to the rich Moonlight Rockhole with most of his team, he continued on to (via a trip to Alice Springs to collect necessary supplies) to approximately 100 km from Ti-Tree where he was killed in questionable circumstances. How Waldron died is still a mystery with many believing that Jack Simpson, known as \\"The Brindled Stag\\", and Doug Cooper, itinerant prospectors, had in fact murdered him. Walter Smith said that Simpson and Cooper, who had already stolen from him, latched on to Waldron (who he referred to only as \\"the gold diviner\\") and went with him to his camp and returned with the story, that the Tennant Creek police accepted, that Waldron's \\"head had been battered when, in falling from a camel, he caught his foot in a stirrup and was dragged at a gallop across the country\\". It is, instead, believed by many that the two killed Waldron with a blow to the head and, to make it appear accidental, attached the body to a mule and dragged in around. An inquiry was made into the death and it was reported in newspapers around Australia (most of which reported that he fell from a horse). Despite no one being prosecuted many Warlipiri people firmly believe that it was a case of murder. The land where Waldron camped is known by the Warlipiri Traditional Owners as Munyupanji and it is located just within the Wirliyajarrayi Land Trust area (previously Willowra Station) and it is here that he is buried with the epitath \\"To strive, to seek, to find and not to yield\\". A hill nearby is also known, in English, as \\"Waldron's Hill\\".

He was the appanage prince of Galich-Mersky and took part in the Great Feudal War. The strange circumstances of his death are described in chronicles with many details and cause speculation about possible poisoning. Biography =Family= Dmitry's father was Yury of Zvenigorod, the son of the hero of the Battle of Kulikovo, Dmitry Donskoy. According to the old testament of Dmitry Donskoy, written when his eldest son Vasily I had no children, Yury was to receive the throne of the Grand Duchy. After the birth of the grandson of Dmitry Donskoy, Vasily II, the issue was not finally resolved, which led to a confrontation between the uncle (Yury of Zvenigorod) and nephew (Vasily II). The sons of Yury were also involved in this struggle for power. The exact date of birth of Dmitry Krasny is unknown. The first time he was mentioned in the title of a treaty of 1427/1428, that was not preserved (only an inventory is known), as Dmitry Menshoy (i.e. junior in relation to the older brother, Dmitry Shemyaka). Since his mother Anastasia died in 1422, he was born earlier. The author of the biography of his father believed that Dmitry Krasny was born in 1421, but known historian Zimin suggested that at 1425 (when Yury start the open struggle for power) he had \\"four young, but already independent sons at the age of 20-24\\". Despite the fact that only three sons of Yuri Zvenigorodsky are widely known, there are serious reasons to assume that he had another son, Ivan Yuryevich. The later went to a monastery under the name of the monk Ignatius and died in 1432. However, a study of the remains of the older brother (Dmitry Shemyaka) showed that he was most likely born around 1413 (at the time of his death in 1453, he was about 40 years old). Thus, Dmitry Krasny could be born in 1414-1422. =Great Feudal War= Sophia of Lithuania pulls the belt from Vasily Kosoy during a wedding feast at 1433. Painting by Pavel Chistyakov. After the death of Vasily I in 1425, Yury Zvenigorodsky began to struggle for power with his nephew Vasily II. However, at first both sides avoided an open clash (Metropolitan Photius did much to reconcile his relatives). One treaty (or draft of the treaty) between Vasily and Yury with his son Dmitry Menshoy (Krasny) dates back to 1427/1428. Historians note that in this case the elder brothers of Dmitry Krasny were not mentioned, which may indicate their independent role or even the beginning of the confrontation with their father. At the famous feast in 1433, when a quarrel over the belt occurred, only older brothers were present again; thus, the father and youngest son (Dmitry Krasny) were opposed to them at that time. But now the offended elder sons went to Galich and teamed up with their father. The combined forces defeated Vasily and so Yury, according to the testament of Dmitry Donskoy, sent Vasily to reign in Kolomna. However, Kosoy and Shemyaka were not satisfied; they killed boyar Morozov, the initiator of the peace agreement with Vasily, and left Moscow. The position of Yury became fragile and he soon abandoned Moscow. In 1433, a new treaty was signed between Vasily and Yur–Ω together with Dmitry Krasny. In it, as a separate paragraph, Yury and Dmitry Krasny pledged not to help Kosoy ana Shemyaka. Historian Zimin suggests that the agreement implied a joint struggle against the eldest sons of Yuri. Under the agreement, Dmitry Krasny got Bezhetsky Verkh from Vasily. Thus, Dmitry Krasny continued to follow his father's moderate policies, while his older brothers were more radical. In 1434 an open clash happened and the combined forces of Yury with his sons prevailed over Vasily II. The Vologda-Perm chronicle noted that Dmitry Krasny participated in the father's march on Moscow. Yury sat on the throne of the Grand Duchy in Moscow, and two Dmitry (Shemyaka and Krasny) were sent in pursuit of Vasily II. But along the way, the word got round that their father had died (he was at the head of the state only for two months), and Vasily Kosoy, the eldest of the brothers, declared himself ruler. This was a complete violation of all laws of succession: both majorat and agnatic seniority. Two Dmitry did not recognize the claims of their older brother and went over to the side of Vasily. Under an agreement with Vasily II, Dmitry Krasny received the important cities of Galich and Vyshgorod (according to the will of his father, Yury of Zvenigorod) and also Bezhetsky Verkh. In the war of two Vasily in 1434-1436, he did not take a noticeable part, although the military campaigns of Vasily Kosoy affected his lands. Zimin characterizes the behavior of Dmitry Krasny at this time as \\"lacking initiative\\". However, in the decisive battle near Skoryatin, Dmitry Krasny fought along with Vasily II against his older brother. =Death= Death of Dmitry Krasniy After the final defeat of Vasily Kosoy in 1436, Vasily II concluded a new treaty with the senior Dmitry (Shemyaka). Vasily II took the possessions of the rebel prince, but the inheritance of a died son of Dmitry Donskoy, Konstantin, remained in the domain of Dmitry Shemyaka and Dmitry Krasny. These were the cities of Rzhev and Uglich, as well as part of Moscow. Two brothers owned them together and Vasily II promised not to interfere in the management of these possessions. In 1437, two Dmitry commanded a large army, sent by Vasily II against the exiled Khan Ulugh Muhammad. This campaign was ended in a catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Belyov. In 1439 Ulugh Muhammad, who settled in Kazan, struck back; he plundered the outskirts of Moscow and burned Kolomna. Dmitry Shemyaka did not send his troops, which sharply worsened his relationship with Vasily II. Dmitry Krasny, by contrast, became governor in Moscow during the absence of Vasily II. In the fall of 1440 Dmitry Krasny, still a young man, suddenly died in his inheritance Bezhetsky Verkh. The description of his death in the chronicle is uniquely in-depth and emotional, with many details. At first he was sick for a long time, he could not eat, lost sleep and even seemed to go deaf. On Sunday, 18 September he was able to take the sacrament, although he was bleeding from his nose and through the pores on his skin. After the sacrament, for a short time he felt better, he was able to eat a little. At night, his condition worsened, it even seemed to others that he had already died. However, he suddenly came to life and the next two days he read out loud prayers and sang psalms but talked with people around him off the mark. This delusional state ended on Wednesday, and the next day, September 22, Dmitry Krasny died. The body was brought to Moscow only on October 14, and when they opened the temporary coffin to move the body to a stone tomb, it did not show any signs of decay, \\"his face was white as that of a sleeping man\\". He was buried in the same grave with his father Yury of Zvenigorod in Cathedral of the Archangel. Tatyana Panova, author of the book \\"Poisons in the struggle for power. Russia. XI - beginning of the XVII century\\", suggests that Dmitry Krasny was poisoned by arsenic. In her opinion, this is indicated by both a description of his decease and too good preservation of the body. However, the burial itself remains unstudied. As the commissioner of the murder, she points to Vasily II. Heritage Nothing is known about his wife or children. Dmitry Shemyaka at first considered all the inheritance of the deceased brother to be his own. So, he transferred one village near Bezhetsky Verkh to the Trinity Monastery \\"for the soul\\" of Dmitry Krasny. In 1441-1442, Vasily II waged a war against Dmitry Shemyaka. The Abbot of the Trinity Monastery reconciled them, and Shemyaka received Galich and Vyshgorod (possessions of Dmitry Krasny under an agreement in 1434), but now Vasily II was in charge of the Bezhetsky Verkh. Dmitry Krasny was glorified as a \\"faithful prince\\" by the Russian Orthodox Church, but at the beginning of the 20th century he was forgotten. Professor Golubinsky included him in the \\"List of the deceased, who are not really commemorated\\".

Her main sphere of academic research was Early Russian and Byzantine chant. Biography Born in Moscow to the family of the military engineer Evgeny Fyodorovitch Lozovoy. Music study started while a child. In 1971 she finished the course in music theory at the Moscow Music College linked with the Moscow Conservatory, gaining a diploma with distinction. The same year she entered the Conservatory in the department of theory and composition. Since 1973, influenced by her husband Mikhail Kollontay, she started research on the early Russian chant tradition. In 1976 she graduated from the conservatory and started postgraduate studies under the tutorship of Valentina Kholopova, completing them in 1981. She submitted her PhD thesis Original Traits of the Stolpovoy Znamenny Chant (defended in Kiev, 1987). She worked as a scholarly editor for the publishing houses Sovetskaya Encyclopedia (1976-1989) and Kompozitor (1990‚Äì1993), and was also a lecturer at the St.-Tikhon Theological Orthodox Institute (now Saint Tikhon's Orthodox University) (1992‚Äì1997). From 1993 onwards she worked at the Department of the History of Russian Music of the Moscow Conservatory (from 2000 as a Professor). In 1995 she became the head of the Rev. Dimitry Razumovsky Scholarly Centre for Russian Church Music within the Department of the History of Russian Music, which in September 2017 was transformed into the Scholarly Creative Centre of Church Music. During this period she organised at the conservatory five international scholarly conferences and was editor-in-chief of their proceedings titled ‚ÄúHymnology‚Äù (7 issues, 2000-2017)Moscow Conservatory. ‚ÄúHymnology‚Äù Transactions. Issues 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (In Russian). She organised the section ‚ÄúByzantium and Old Rus‚Äô: Liturgical and Chant Traditions‚Äù at the international scholarly theological conference ‚ÄúRussia and Athos: A Millennium of Spiritual Unity‚Äù (2006). She created and ran (from 1994) a special course of lectures on ‚ÄúThe History of Russian Music of the 11th to 17th Centuries‚Äù. She also initiated additional faculty courses that developed and deepened the main sphere of her scholarly activity. Among them were: ‚ÄúThe practical study of znamenny chant based on the living tradition‚Äù, ‚ÄúMusical palaeography‚Äù, ‚ÄúGreek palaeography‚Äù, ‚ÄúSlavic palaeography,‚Äù ‚ÄúAn introduction to Byzantine and early Russian art‚Äù and ‚ÄúZnamenny chant‚Äù. To enhance the liturgical and general cultural horizon of the students she initiated a course on the ‚ÄúHistory of Eastern Orthodox worship‚Äù, which still continues. From 1998 she collaborated with the Orthodox Encyclopedia ecclesiastical scholarly centre as a member of the editorial board and curator of the ‚ÄúWorship and Church music‚Äù department (since 2004 an independent department of ‚ÄúChurch music‚Äù); she was the author of a number of entries on early Russian and Byzantine church music. Under her tutorship two PhD theses were submitted, one by Olga Tiurina (‚ÄúEarly Russian Melismatic Chant: the Great Chant‚Äù, 2011) and the other by Irina Starikova (‚ÄúThe Psalmody of the Vigils in Early Russian Chant Art‚Äù, 2013). In 2004/2005 Irina Lozovaya was the co-founder with Anna Yeliseyeva of the Asmatikon ensemble, which specialises on performing early Russian and Byzantine liturgical chants. She was a member of the editorial board of the Moscow conservatory and influenced the publishing policy of the conservatory with regard to early Russian chant. Research Activity She was the author of numerous articles and entries on the problems of the history and theory of Eastern Christian liturgical chant art in various anthologies of articles and encyclopedias including Musical Encyclopedia (', 1973-1982), Musical Encyclopedic Dictionary (', 1990), Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart, New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (2nd edition, Vol. 29, 2004), Orthodox Encyclopedia (2000-2017). Characteristic of Lozovaya‚Äôs work is her comprehensive approach to studying the liturgical chant books. The main task of their investigation, in her opinion, requires a combination of the methods of both historical and theoretical musicology and therefore presupposes a good knowledge of historical liturgiology, palaeography and codicology . Important for Lozovaya‚Äôs scholarly method was a consideration of early Russian music within the historical ‚ÄúByzantine‚Äù perspective: The book Paraklete on early Russian chant (in the Russian State Archive of the Early Acts, abbreviated as RGADA, f. 381 (Syn. Typ.), No. 80) became the main subject of her scholarly research. The investigation resulted in a monograph ‚ÄúEarly Russian Notated Paraklete of the 12th Century: Byzantine Sources and the Typology of the Early Russian Copies‚Äù (Moscow, 2009). This monograph was intended to be as the first part of a larger piece of research. However, the second part, in which Lozovaya hoped to ‚Äúpropose the study of the problems of the early forms of znamenny notation‚Äù was never completed. There are many other items of her academic and methodological writing (including didactic tables and illustrative materials for the special course on the history of Russian music) which are preserved in her archive but remain unpublished.

Nothing is known about his life before and after his work in Saint Gall. He is documented neither in the obituary of Saint Gall nor in that of Reichenau.  Works  In the course of the Investiture Controversy, Counter-king Hermann of Salm replaced Lutold, who had been appointed as counter-abbot of Saint Gall by Hermann's predecessor Rudolf of Rheinfelden, with Werinhar, a monk from Reichenau. Subsequently, Ekkehart, the Abbot of Reichenau tried repeatedly to establish Werinhar in Saint Gall. However, Werinhar actually only presided over the abbey for a short time, probably around the year 1086, when Abbot Ulrich of Eppenstein, who had been appointed by King Henry IV, assumed the Patriarchate of Aquileia. Apparently, he was so heavily pressured by Ulrich's followers in Saint Gall that he voluntarily abdicated that same year.

It is a Grade I listed building. The church is dedicated to Saint Clement, a successor to Saint Peter at Rome.Anne Roper. The Gift of the Sea: Romney Marsh. Birlings (Kent) Ltd. 1984. Pages 84‚Äì88. It is built on an artificial mound to protect it from floodwater. It is thought the original church was built in the 8th century. In the 11th or 12th century the Saxon church was replaced by an early Norman church, aisleless and with a square- ended chancel. It was enlarged in the 13th century. The present building, mostly of the 13th century, has a nave and chancel, and there are north and south chapels. There is a small tower, with south-east and south-west buttresses, in the south-west corner, and a north porch. Interior The box pews in the nave are of the 18th century. At the west end is a gallery, of late 18th century, supported by four Doric columns. There are Georgian wooden panels showing texts, on the walls of the nave. The font, in the south-west, is of the Decorated period, about 1300. It is square, and is supported by a central octagonal pillar; at each corner is a column with a carved capital. Looking towards the chancel, showing the Royal Arms and the hagioscopes on either side of the chancel arch. In the chancel of the north chapel is a medieval altar stone, or mensa. This was found, during the renovation of the late 1960s, in the ground outside the church near the porch, and was originally thought to be a memorial slab. =Chancel= Over the chancel arch is the Royal Arms of England, of 1800 (including the Fleur-de-lys, omitted in later Royal Arms). The altar rails are of the early 18th century. There are 17th-century wooden panels behind the altar showing the Lord's Prayer, the Creed and the Commandments. A stone slab to the memory of John Deffray is in the middle of the chancel floor. Deffray, a Huguenot, born in France in 1661, was Rector of St Clements from 1690 to his death in 1738. The slab bears his French coat of arms.\\"St Clement, Old Romney\\" theromneymarsh.net. Retrieved 30 October 2019. Renovation Nave, looking south-west, showing the gallery and the south chapel. In 1929 the panelling round the chancel arch, of about 1788, was removed; this revealed a rood staircase doorway, and two hagioscopes between nave and chancel. The plaster ceiling of the chancel was removed, revealing the rafters. In 1959 there was renovation by Anthony Swaine, a Canterbury architect. The east face of the tower was rebuilt and some timber was replaced. The roof over the nave and south aisle was repaired. Renovation ceased when the money available was exhausted. The church was used for location scenes in the film Dr Syn, Alias the Scarecrow (1963); for this the film company repainted the box pews and the gallery, and repaired the stairway to the gallery. The film company left money for further repairs to be done, and, also supported by other grants, renovation was continued; it was completed in 1968.

Located within the Ocean Grove Reserve between St Kilda Beach and Smaills Beach, at the point where Otago Peninsula joins the mainland of the South Island, Tomahawk Beach is a white sand beach popular with casual beach- goers and dog-walkers as well as surfers. Sand is extracted from the Tomahawk Lagoon channel, which runs across the beach, for commercial purposes and to prevent flooding.  Name  The word \\"Tomahawk\\", documented in the Otago Witness from 1852, is unlikely to be a reference to the weapon; it is more likely an anglicized form of the MƒÅori words toma haka. Toma means a place of bones, or shrine for bones; haka is commonly taken to refer to the MƒÅori dance of challenge (hence the interpretation \\"dance by a gravesite\\"), but may instead represent the Southern MƒÅori form of the word hanga, to build or create. However, there are no known pre-European burial sites or reported finds of human bones in the area.  Physical geography  Tomahawk Beach is approximately long and faces due south. To the west the beach is bounded by the cliffs of Lawyers Head, beyond which lies Ocean Beach, Dunedin's most popular beach (the near end of which is referred to as \\"St Kilda Beach\\"). Approximately east of the cliffs Tomahawk Beach is divided by the outlet channel of Tomahawk Lagoon; the beach's main access track runs along the dunes immediately above this channel. To the east, Tomahawk is separated from Smaills Beach by a small promontory of black volcanic rock, referred to in 19th-century accounts as Tomahawk Bluff, on the top of which stands the Jack Fox Lookout. At very low tides the base of the promontory is exposed, making Tomahawk and Smaills effectively a single beach. Northward, the beach rises into scrub-covered dunes and a steep slope leading up to the suburb of Ocean Grove. The beach slopes strongly southward between the tide lines but flattens out below the low tide mark. The swell is usually strong. Both headlands are associated with rip currents and there is usually a rip current near the middle of the beach. = Wildlife = Tomahawk Beach is sometimes visited by yellow-eyed penguins, little blue penguins, New Zealand sea lions, and rarely crabeater seals. Visitors are advised to take care and keep their distance, for the sake of these animals' safety and, in the case of the sea lions, their own. Red-billed gulls and black-backed gulls are often seen on the beach. = Environmental concerns = Wind erosion of the sand dunes is a concern at Tomahawk Beach as for much of the adjacent coastline. The Dunedin City Council is addressing this concern by an ongoing programme of contouring and revegetation, through a memorandum of understanding with the Tomahawk Smaills Beachcare Trust. At the western end of the beach the water is periodically found to be polluted from the outfall of the nearby Tahuna wastewater treatment plant.  Social geography  = History = Prior to European colonization, Smaills and Tomahawk Beaches formed part of a walking track for MƒÅori travelling between ≈åtƒÅkou and Tomahawk Lagoon. In 1897 the local area including both Smaills and Tomahawk Beaches was classified as a government reserve, and in 1931 it was formally established as the Ocean Grove Reserve. = Current use = Tomahawk Beach is popular with beachgoers seeking to avoid the crowds of neighbouring Ocean Beach, and can be surfed on all tides, though ‚Äì due to the risk of sewage pollution ‚Äì surfing is more popular at the eastern end. It is particularly favoured by dog walkers. Tomahawk Beach was not patrolled by lifeguards until January 2018. Most classes of motor vehicle are banned from Dunedin beaches by the Reserves and Beaches Bylaw 2017. Both before and after the passing of the bylaw, Tomahawk has been the site of multiple vehicle strandings in the rising tide. Sand is extracted in small quantities from the Tomahawk Lagoon outlet under permit from the Otago Regional Council. In addition to commercial benefit, it is argued that this reduces the risk of flooding in the lagoon.

It was established in 1936 and is a Grade II listed building.  History  De Bohun Primary School was established in 1936 and divided into junior mixed and infants' departments a year later. Juniors occupied the first floor and infants the ground floor from 1955. The school had 324 juniors and 289 infants, including 60 nursery children in 1973. In December 2009, the school was in the bottom ten of state primary schools in London with the lowest percentage of students passing SATs in both English and maths combined, at 37%. A book titled Outdoor Learning in the Early Years: Management and Innovation by Helen Bilton was published in 2010. It described the school's reception children as being \\"very clear what the expectations of the class are and they know that the staff are willing to pursue and develop their interests. Children come into the room confident and very willing to get going with their current interests\\". In July 2012, the condition of the school building was described by its headteacher Terry Scott, as \\"looking like a war-torn building\\" and \\"not fit for a school\\". There were cracks in some of the walls, some of the masonry from the windows ledges had come away, windows that don't open and the roof in poor condition. It was noted as being expensive to repair due to the school being a listed building. Along with other schools in the London Borough of Enfield, the school was under pressure to increase its intake because of a boom in the birth rate and many families moving out of inner London to the suburbs, due to the benefit caps making it unaffordable. Its classroom sizes however are which is less than the present minimum requirement of for teaching a class of 30. The school was placed into 'special measures' by Ofsted following its inspection in October 2012 but was rated 'good' in July 2016. In August 2013, along with a number of other primary schools in London, it was part of a ¬£1.2 million 'Size and Lung Function in Children' or 'SLIC' study by the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, where its researchers visited these schools in a mobile testing laboratory and provided science workshops alongside the lung measurements. It was funded primarily by the Wellcome Trust and \\"provided the first clear evidence of the extent to which lung capacities differ between healthy children of different ethnicities\\".

These coins were derived from the Sasanian coinage design, probably transmitted to the subcontinent by the Alchon Huns as they invaded northern India circa 500 CE. They are an important component of Indian coinage. Design and extent Indo- Sasanian coins derive from three Sasanian prototypes, which were introduced in western India by the Alchon Huns, also called Hunas by the Indians. =Western and northwestern regions= Indo-Sasanian coinage covers a period of several centuries, during which it is possible to see a progressive degradation and stylisation of the original Sasanian design, in ways which vary according to the region where they were current. Typically, the bust of the king on the obverse is highly simplified and geometric, and the design of the fire altar, with or without the two attendants, appears as a geometrical motif on the reverse of this type of coinage.\\"The Indo-Sassanian coins, also termed as Gadahiya and circulated from 600 to 1200 A.D., are found in good numbers from Ahmadahad, Banaskantha, Bhavanagar, Junagarh, Kaira, Kutch, Mehsana, of Gujarat.\\" in This coinage was current among the various polities of Western India succeeding the collapse of the Gupta Empire, such as the Gurjaras, Pratiharas, Chaulukya-Paramara and Palas from circa 530 CE to 1202 CE.

History It opened in 2014 with 150 middle school students. 220 applications for admission were submitted to the school by April 2013. It was the first non-disciplinary charter school operated by the district. The school had a cost of $5.5 million; funds used to establish the school originated in savings amassed from government funds for the disciplinary schools, and the establishment used almost all of the district's savings. Braination closed one of its existing schools, located in a detention center in Post, Texas, and gave its state campus identification number to Frank because its charter limited it to operating six schools. In 2014 the school had seven teachers, what it called \\"facilitators\\", with all but one having prior significant teaching experience. Its elementary school facility and 9th grade were scheduled to open in fall 2015.

Campus The facility, designed by RVK Architects, has of space. The school was designed to have extracurricular activities and includes a coffeeshop, a nature trail, a pond, and a treehouse.

Learning is self-directed, with students meeting advisors and attending teacher-directed seminars each morning before starting work. Students may engage in tutoring, work in small groups, or work by themselves. Therefore the school lacks a bell schedule, as well as desks and hallways seen in traditional middle schools.

Kuprilya Springs and Hermannsburg (Ntaria) are both of the traditional lands of the Western Arrarnta people.  History  Hermannsburg Mission, which also functioned as a cattle station, was established on 4 June 1877 and, between then and 1926 suffered many droughts that caused them to struggle to stay viable while, at the same time, meaning that many Aboriginal people came into the mission because of the lack of availability of food and their traditional lands being curtailed by pastoralists. The drought, and subsequent scarcity of water, was so severe in 1926 that the mission was almost forced to close and that many of the people living on the mission suffered from ill health and scurvy. Jose Petrick says that, between 1926-1929, that 41 of the 51 children born at the mission died and that, in 1929 alone, 41 adults and children died. The scarcity of water also impacted the European population and Pastor Albrecht's own daughter Helene became ill herself and, at the age of four, weighed less than she had at two. During this time most water used was drawn by hand from wells and soaks in the Finke River bed and a lot of this water contained large amounts of magnesium which made people ill and, as they dried up, increasingly salty. It is around this time that a pipeline to Kuprilya Springs was given as a solution but there were disagreements between various 'factions' of the Mission Board and also with the government; a large part of the argument was who's responsibility it was to provide water and who would pay for it. As they argued the drought worsened. In 1929, after the completion of the railway to Alice Springs, Hermannsburg was visited by Melbourne artist Jessie Traill and her friend Una Teague. Una's sister, Violet Teague, already an established artist rushed to the mission to help and, after hiring a taxi to drive her all the way from Melbourne to Hermannsburg, painted prolifically once there. When in Hermannsburg the Teague sisters and Traill camped and Albert Namatjira was their \\"guide, camel boy, cook and attendant\\" on their painting excursions and Violet, in particular, was so well liked by Albert and his wife Rubina that they named one of their daughters after her: unfortunately baby Violet died when only 5 months old. Once back in Melbourne Violet sold these paintings, and others donated by members of the Victorian Artists Society and the exhibition was held at the Athenaeum Gallery; Rex Battarbe also contributed a painting. In addition to artworks there were various appeals, many of them run in newspapers, and books were also sold. Mrs Aeaneas Gunn gave away many copies of her books for the cause; including autographed copies. In December 1934 work on the pipeline finally begun and it was mostly constructed by Aboriginal men who often had to work at night to avoid the heat, it was backbreaking work. The pipeline was completed on 30 September 1935 and, at the estimated time for the water to arrive, nothing happened and Pastor Albrecht passed a restless night until the water arrived the next day (1 October); this is still celebrated as Kuprilya Day.

For example, Wang et. al. used survey data from Xbox gamers to predict U.S. presidential election results. The Xbox gamers were 65% 18-29-year olds and 93% male, while the electorate as a whole was 19% 18-29-year olds and 47% male. The poststratification refers to the process of adjusting the estimates, essentially a weighted average of estimates from all possible combinations of attributes (in this example age and sex, though there were more). Each combination is sometimes called a \\"cell.\\" The multilevel regression is used to smooth noisy estimates in the cells with too little data by using overall or nearby averages. One application is estimating preferences in sub-regions (e.g., states, individual constituencies) based on individual-level survey data gathered at other levels of aggregation (e.g., national surveys).  The technique and its advantages  The technique essentially involves using data from, for example, censuses relating to various types of people corresponding to different characteristics (e.g., age, race), in a first step to estimate the relationship between those types and individual preferences (i.e., multi- level regression of the dataset). This relationship is then used in a second step to estimate the sub-regional preference based on the number of people having each type/characteristic in that sub-region (a process known as \\"poststratification\\"). In this way the need to perform surveys at sub-regional level, which can be expensive and impractical in an area (e.g., a country) with many sub-regions (e.g. counties, ridings, or states), is avoided. It also avoids issues with consistency of survey when comparing different surveys performed in different areas. Additionally, it allows the estimating of preference within a specific locality based on a survey taken across a wider area that includes relatively few people from the locality in question, or where the sample may be highly unrepresentative.  History  The technique was originally developed by Gelman and T. Little in 1997 , building upon ideas of Fay and Herriot and R. Little. It was subsequently expanded on by Park, Gelman, and Bafumi in 2004 and 2006. It was proposed for use in estimating US- state-level voter preference by Lax and Philips in 2009. Warshaw and Rodden subsequently proposed it for use in estimating district-level public opinion in 2012. Wang et al. subsequently used it for estimating the outcome of the 2012 US presidential election based on a survey of Xbox users, and it has also been proposed for use in the field of epidemiology. YouGov used the technique to successfully predict the overall outcome of the 2017 UK general election, correctly predicting the result in 93% of constituencies.  Limitations and Extensions  MRP can be extended to estimating the change of opinion over time and when used to predict elections works best when used relatively close to the polling date, after nominations have closed. Both the \\"multilevel regression\\" and \\"poststratification\\" ideas of MRP can be generalized. Multilevel regression can be replaced by nonparametric regression or regularized prediction, and poststratification can be generalized to allow for non-census variables, i.e. poststratification totals that are estimated rather than being known.

Career  Blackwell was employed as an engineer on the Kennet and Avon Canal in 1806, working primarily as site agent on the Caen Hill Flight in Devizes, Wiltshire. While John Rennie designed the flight, it was likely that construction was undertaken by the Kennet and Avon Canal Company and its engineers. In 1808, shortly before the completion of the flight, Blackwell moved to work with Rennie on Crofton Pumping Station. The following year, the pair built the remaining locks on the canal‚Äîtwo pound locks Oakhill Down near Froxfield, which replaced an earlier single deeper lock. Original plans would have seen the lock be the canal's only staircase, although this proposal was never seen through. Blackwell was appointed the company's resident engineer on 19 July 1814, with a salary of ¬£300 (plus ¬£50 expenses to cover a horse). Blackwell subsequently undertook essential maintenance of the waterway, ensuring passage for fast boats could be made‚Äîallowing transport between London and Bristol in five days. In 1824, Blackwell was instructed to survey a railway link between the canal and Salisbury; he had previously surveyed a railway between the River Avon and the collieries at Coalpit Heath. In his research, Blackwell travelled to the north of England to visit some of the early railway systems, but remarked that \\"no great improvements have been made, there are limits to their powers which are nearly approached\\". The canal company accepted his opinion, and the scheme was cancelled. He later visited the Liverpool and Manchester and Cromford railways. In 1829, Caen Hill had gas lighting installed under Blackwell's supervision. In 1832, Blackwell met English engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who described him as a \\"bigoted, obstinate, practical man.\\" The meeting came during Brunel's work on an alternative route to the Black Dog Turnpike near Claverton. The canal company was concerned that the new road may cause the clay hillside to slip into the waterway. Brunel, in return, was disparaging of the canal's upkeep, was dismissive of Blackwell for suggesting a landslide might be caused by the new road, and said that past slips were \\"considerably assisted by the bad management of the canal\\". He felt that Blackwell refused to justify his concerns. Brunel continued with the project, but once the project was complete, the road did indeed slip as predicted. Blackwell was inducted into the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1833. In the early 1830s, a huge programme of work was undertaken, including the conversion of numerous turf-sided locks on the Kennet Navigation into brick and masonry lock chambers. In approximately 1834, Blackwell built Ufton Lock, a brand new lock on a dedicated cut near Ufton Nervet in Berkshire. The new cut, of approximately , bypassed a section of meandering river. The lock only changed the navigation level by approximately , and when the waterway was restored in the 20th century, the lock was deemed unnecessary and it was removed. Blackwell engineered a similar cut at Burghfield, although the cut both left and rejoined the river above Burghfield Lock and no rebuilding was required. One of Blackwell's later projects was Wilton Water. Initially, Crofton Pumping Station used water from natural springs. In 1836, Blackwell created the spring-fed reservoir to provide a greater water supply. Blackwell's sluices and outfall from the reservoir were given Grade II listed status in 1986.  Personal life  Blackwell married Frances \\"Fanny\\" Cooper in Burbage, Wiltshire, on 23 August 1808. They had five children‚ÄîEmma (born in Burbage in 1808), Eliza (born in Great Bedwyn in 1811), Harriet (born in Devizes in 1814), Louisa (b. 1817) and Thomas Evans Blackwell (b. 1819). At the 1861 census, Emma, Eliza and Harriett were all living together in Bath in John Eveleigh's Beaufort Buildings. The plaque in Devizes dedicated to Blackwell's work with the Kennet and Avon Canal Blackwell died in Hungerford, Berkshire, on 28 September 1840. He was buried in a vault in the churchyard at St Lawrence's Church in the town. A memorial to Blackwell in the church reads: A plaque dedicated to Blackwell was erected on Prison Bridge, Devizes, after his death, reading: Thomas became a civil engineer, and upon his father's death became engineer of the Kennet and Avon Canal. He emigrated to Canada in the 1850s.

Life  Hellen Stirk was married to James Ranaldsone, a skinner burgess of Perth, another of the convicted Perth Martyrs. The couple had one son and two daughters.  Accusation of blasphemy  The specific charge against Hellen Stirk was that, despite persuasion, she had refused to call upon the Virgin Mary to ease her recent childbirth, instead calling only to God. In doing so, Stirk was deemed to have judged the Virgin Mary without merit, and that Mary should not be \\"preferred before other women\\".  Death  After her conviction, Stirk requested to be executed along with the other martyrs, but this request was denied.

Works  After Heinrich von Twiel had been elected abbot by the emperor-supporting party of the convent in 1121, his opponents contested the legitimacy of his election and appointed Manegold von Mammern as abbot. The official inauguration occurred in September 1122. Manegold focused his work as abbot on the restoration of the erstwhile property of the abbey. This had become necessary because both he and his opponent, Heinrich von Twiel, had in the course of the battle for the abbacy tried to build a loyal following by means of granting fief. Manegold succeeded in restoring the monastery property north of Lake Constance to the Abbey of Saint Gall. In order to secure the restored property, he built Castle Pra√überg near Wangen.

His wife continued to teach his work following his death. Somatics At the University of Florida, Hanna studied neurology and developed the idea that all life experiences lead to physical patterns in the body. In 1969, he published these ideas in his book \\"Bodies in Revolt: A Primer in Somatic Thinking\\". Moving to San Francisco in 1973, he was introduced to the Functional Integration of Mosh√© Feldenkrais and in 1975 he led the first Feldenkrais course in the United States. Hanna became director of the Humanistic Psychology Institute (later renamed into Saybrook Institute) in 1973. Together with his new wife Eleanor Criswell Hanna, they started the Novato Institute for Somatic Research and Training in 1975 and published the new journal \\"Somatics: Magazine-Journal of the Bodily Arts and Sciences\\". It provided a new venue where the ideas of Somatics could be discussed. He developed his ideas and published them in Somatics: Reawakening The Mind's Control Of Movement, Flexibility, And Health in 1988. He proclaimed that it's possible to age without chronic stiffness, bad back, chronic pain, fatigue, and that even high blood pressure don't occur if we maintain conscious control of nerves and muscles. He claimed that we can relearn abilities lost due to Sensory Motor Amnesia and develop what he calls Sensory-Motor Awareness. In 1990 he started his own training program at the Novato Institute to teach Hanna Somatic Education. Publications * Hanna, Thomas L. (1958). The Thought and Art of Albert Camus.

It was carried out by both men and women, it was a very elongated and gruelling campaign that went on for 86 years before the Representation of the People Act 1918 was introduced on 6 February 1918, which provided a few women with the right to vote. One of the earlier societies supporting women's rights to vote was established in Scotland's capital, the Edinburgh National Society for Women's Suffrage. Scottish suffragettes released from prison with Flora Drummond Later Scotland's suffragettes were part of the British Women's Social and Political Union militant movement, and took part in campaigns locally and in London; for example when Winston Churchill arrived to stand for election as M.P. in Dundee in 1908 he was followed by 27 of the national leaders of the women's suffrage movements. At one point he even hid in a shed and tried to host a meeting there. Scottish women like Flora Drummond had leadership roles with the Pankhursts, in the London WSPU headquarters, and celebrated the Scottish community of activists on their release from prison. Others like Frances Parker, from New Zealand, were organising the West of Scotland WSPU and like others was infamously subjected to force feeding orally and rectally in Scottish and British prisons. Parker was also arrested when trying to disrupt David Lloyd George from giving a speech in the Music Hall in Aberdeen, and allegedly set fire to Burns Cottage in Alloway, Ayrshire. There were many Scottish women across all classes who took an active role in the movement to draw attention to the growing demands for equal right to Votes for Women. Scottish branches of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies were active in the main cities and even in the rural and remote areas such as Dornoch, in the Highlands, Stornoway with 27 women forming a suffrage association, from the remote Western Isles (the Hebrides), as well as NUWSS Orcadian group in Orkney and a Shetland suffrage society.

He was elected honorary professor for philosophy of economics in 2013 and regularly holds lectures on interdisciplinary and intra-confessional subjects. In late 2014, he survived an airplane crash with a twin-engine Beechcraft Duchess in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He is currently living in Starnberg, Bavaria, and at Hofhegnenberg Castle. Peter L√∂w was listed as one of the 1001 richest Germans (rank 310) according to the research of German Manager Magazin in 2019.Die Macht des Geldes.

Activities Since 1992, L√∂w acquired majority stakes or significant shares in more than 250 national and international enterprises. These under performing companies were predominantly acquired at a symbolic valuations, often followed by extensive operational improvement measures with the aim of either restructuring and reorganizing them to then re-sell them once sustainable profitability had been reached, or to hold them in the company's portfolio. Under L√∂w's leadership numerous companies and trademarks from diverse industries were successfully restored, amongst them Teutonia, Zielpunkt, Adler Modem√§rkte, Versatel, and SKW Metallurgie. For example, Alzchem SE in Trostberg, Bavaria, a worldwide leading special chem group, specialized in carbides, with over 1,400 employees, belongs to his long-term portfolio.Peter L√∂w: V√§ter in den Augen ihrer S√∂hne, J.P.

The subsidiary was renamed in December 2005 to operate under the name Arquana International Print & Media AG. According to Arques, it was planned to establish Arquana as Europe's market leader in offset printing. The company was profitably sold on the exchange. Unfortunately Arques‚Äô plan proved to be unsuccessful, as most individual companies belonging to Arquana, as well as the holding itself, fell into insolvency only a few years later. The current portfolio of the LIVIA Group includes several listed historic properties that have been extensively renovated and restored; for example, Hofhegnenberg Castle in Bavaria, Frankenberg Castle in Central Franconia, the South African wine estate Vergenoegd, and the Tuscan estate San Martino a Sezzate.

After tumultuous decades with elections of counter-abbots, the election was held remarkably peacefully, as the chronicles emphasise. Werinher directed his administration to reformations of monastery life. Some monks, who did not adhere to his standards of monastic discipline, were reported by him to the papal legate Cardinal Theodwin in 1134. This rigid policy of reinstating discipline evoked resistance on the part of the monks, but the inner-monastic differences could soon be reconciled. On 12 April 1139, Werinher received the confirmation of privileges and properties from Pope Pope Innocent II. In 1145, he renewed the existing fraternity with the Abbey of Reichenau. As constructor, he built the churches Saint Leonhard and Saint Egidius which Pope Pope Eugene III put under his protection on 13 February 1152. In 1162, Werinher was able to acquire Ittingen Charterhouse from Duke Welf von Ravensburg. As the duke's protecting reeve, Count Udalrich von Gamertingen, died without heirs, the Vogtei came into the possession of Saint Gall. However, it was later sold by Abbot Werinher to Count Rudolf von Pfullendorf for 300 silver marks.

It formed in the middle Lena river basin in the V ‚Äî IV millenniums BCE as a result of the migration of tribes from Transbaikalia, which assimilated the local Sumnagin culture (10,500-6,500 BP) that was preceramic.Richard Zgusta, The Peoples of Northeast Asia through Time: Precolonial Ethnic and Cultural Processes along the Coast between Hokkaido and the Bering Strait. BRILL, 2015 p. 203 The culture got its name from Lake Syalakh, located 90 km from the town of Zhigansk in Yakutia (Saha). The first archaeological excavations in this area were conducted under the direction of A. P. Okladnikov in the 1940s. The sites of the carriers of Syalakh culture are marked by the first appearance of polished stone tools,examples of Syalakh stone tools as well as the earliest ceramics (fired clay pottery with a characteristic mesh pattern). Bone harpoons, and bow and arrows have also been found. More than 50 sites of the Syalakh culture are known. In the decorative arts, a central place is occupied by the images of moose, which reflect mythological representation. The Syalakh culture was followed by the Belkachi culture. According to the linguists, the most likely hypothesis is that representatives of this culture spoke one of the Den√©‚ÄìYeniseian languages. According to Pavel Flegontov et al., :\\"The new wave of population from northeastern Asia that arrived in Alaska at least 4,800 years ago displays clear archaeological precedents leading back to Central Siberia. ... the Syalakh culture peoples, spreading across Siberia after 6,500 YBP, might represent the ‚Äúghost population‚Äù that split off around 6,500-7,000 YBP, and later gave rise to migrants into America.\\"Pavel Flegontov, N.

The knowledge that these maps create is mainly used by policy makers in the field of regional development, city planning or cross-border cooperation. Occasionally, cartopological maps are displayed in art exhibitions about design or spatial planning.  Theoretical background  Example of how geographical maps were \\"decorated\\" with politically and culturally informed drawings The term 'cartopology' was first coined by Dear HunterDear Hunter and the 'Institute of Cartopology' around 2018. However, the actual practice of doing cartopological research is known to be done in the sixteenth century. Early modern cartographers drew all kinds of scenes on the maps that displayed their own cultural or geographical background and political position. Arguably, Alexander von Humboldt is the last explorer that worked with cartopology to study and express his findings. According to the German historian Karl Schl√∂gel, ‚ÄúAlexander von Humboldt is a late embodiment of a knowledge that unites much that would soon grow apart: disciplines such as mineralogy, geography, ethnology, linguistics, botany, zoology, and history; genres such as statistics, geodesy, the registration and recording of all he found in a land, the dense description of situation, and the historical study; and forms of organization - he was a scientist as well as an entrepreneur and manager of science.‚Äù Von Humboldt used his drawing skills and his scientific intellect to create a multi-layered piece of information that could not be retrieved from a merely written scientific paper or factual map of the kind we know today. \\"Humboldt's major scientific contribution was realizing the interconnectedness of climate, geography, nature, and human societies. (...) By creating visualizations of data that had previously been bound up in tables, Humboldt revealed connections that had eluded others.\\" This new understanding of the world should not be seen as a linear piece of information, but rather as a circular and interconnected story. Most current day cartographers however, aim to represent the world in a mere lineal, physical manner. More intimate information based on experiences of the place are therefore left out of the map. In cartopology, this anthropological and ethnographic information is central to the map making process. In this sense, cartopology in the 21st century use of the term, strongly builds on the work of Tim Ingold and Stefan Hirschauer. The former developed an idea around thinking through making. The latter explained how hidden knowledge can be discovered, transferred and modelled into space and time on maps effectively. = Research = Currently, Marlies Vermeulen is working on her doctoral thesis about cartopology. This PhD is supervised by Ruth Benschop from the Lectoraat Autonomie en Openbaarheid in de Kunsten of the Zuyd Hogeschool, Carolin Stapenhorst and Peter Peters from Maastricht University.  Current use  = Policy advice = 'Hills with a history', 2019, Dear Hunter. An exemplary work of cartopologic research. Cartopological research is often carried out at the request of local governments or policy makers who are interested in the way the space that they designed is actually being used. The most important benefit of this type of research, is the fact that it relates directly to the space the policy maker or designer is interested in. The geographical way of working assures the client that the outcome of the research is recognizable and relatable - and therefore instrumental in future design questions. Each problem or noteworthy characteristic of the place will get a concrete place on the map. This map is both the outcome of the research assignment, as well as a detailed report of the process of the research. = Exhibitions = There have been several exhibitions that displayed cartopological work. These exhibitions mainly focused on local design identities or map making as an art form. As an artistic expression, cartopology adds a locality to the design process in the form of storytelling. This is traditionally absent in spatial planning. But it also functions the other way around: in a storytelling process, the location of the story is, in the cartopological sense, often neglected. The cartopologist aims to give the space in which something takes place the credits it deserves. = Education = A specific educational course has been developed called 'Doing Cartopology' which aims to teach students of architecture, anthropology and various art disciplines to become familiar with the benefits of the cartopological method. This course has been taught at various universities and art academies, such as the RWTH in Aachen, Zuyd Hogeschool in Maastricht and KU Leuven.

Life  Ulrich descended from the Aargau family of Tegerfelden; his nephew Konrad was Bishop of Konstanz. From 1166 to 1167, he was provost and after 1167 abbot in Saint Gall. In 1170, he was elected Bishop of Chur, but retained the office of abbot. During his term of office, the reconstruction of the cathedral, whose choir was sanctified by Bishop Berno von Schwerin in 1178, was commenced. After the Third Council of the Lateran had militated against the accumulation of church offices, Ulrich renounced the Bishopric Chur in 1179, but remained Abbot of Saint Gall. As Abbot of Saint Gall, he renewed the existing fraternity with theElectorate of Mainz in 1187. In 1199, shortly before his death, he renounced his abbacy. He died on 12 April, the exact year of death is unknown. Ulrich was probably never consecrated as bishop. This is also indicated by the sanctification of the cathedral through Berno.

Law enforcement investigators have identified four victims and possibly a fifth that are connected to a single, unnamed suspect. Christina White Christina Lee White, 12, disappeared April 28, 1979, from Asotin, Washington after attending a parade with a friend. She had returned to the friend's house and telephoned her mother stating that she felt ill. Her mother advised her to return home but White never appeared and has not been seen since. Kristin David University of Idaho student Kristin Noel David, 22, disappeared June 26, 1981 while biking from Moscow, Idaho to Lewiston. Her dismembered remains were recovered July 4 that same year from the Snake River near Clarkston, Washington. Lewiston Civic Theater incident Kristina Diane Nelson, 21, and her stepsister Jacqueline Ann ‚ÄúBrandy‚Äù Miller, 18, disappeared while walking from Nelson's apartment to a grocery store in downtown Lewiston, Idaho on September 12, 1982. On the same night, Steven R. Pearsall, 35, an employee of the Lewiston Civic Theater, went missing after going to the theater, located at 8th Street and 6th Avenue, to use its laundry facilities. Pearsall and Nelson had worked together at the theater and both attended Lewis-Clark State College and were also neighbors. The remains of Nelson and Miller were found March 19, 1984, in a rural area 35 miles from Lewiston near Kendrick, Idaho. Investigators were unable to determine a cause of death for Nelson, but determined that Miller had been murdered. Pearsall was never located. Investigators initially suspected Pearsall may have been involved in the Nelson-Miller abduction and murders, but later stated that all three had probably been in or near the theater at the time they vanished and were likely victims of the same killer. Suspects In 1984, Idaho State Police stated that serial killer Ottis Toole had \\"implicated himself\\" in the murder of David and was their \\"strongest suspect\\", but added that two other men had also confessed to the same crime. In 2009, a retired Lewiston police detective who had also interviewed Toole stated that he had ruled him out as a suspect. In 1995, Lewiston police announced that Nelson, Miller, and Pearsall may have been murdered together inside the Lewiston Civic Theater by another theater employee. The unnamed suspect, who was present at the theater the night of the trio's disappearance, had also lived in the home from which Christina White disappeared in 1979. In 1998, authorities from Spokane, Washington who were investigating the killings that would later be attributed to Robert Lee Yates interviewed this same suspect. In 1998, Lewiston police stated their belief that Kristin David's murder was linked with the other Lewiston-area murders and disappearances. A 2009 news report stated that David had worked for a time at the Lewiston Civic Theater and may have known the same theater employee suspected in the Nelson- Miller-Pearsall case. In 2011, a 53-minute documentary examining the case, Confluence, was released. In 2018, a two-part television documentary series examining the case, Cold Valley, aired on the Investigation Discovery network. An Asotin County police detective who appeared on the program reaffirmed the links police had made earlier between the White and Pearsall disappearances and murders of Nelson and Miller, stating they were likely the work of the same killer. The program also linked the unnamed suspect with three other deaths in and outside the region, including an unsolved Chicago murder from 1963.

She also undertook work as a press photographer. Life =Provenance and early years= Edith Barakovich was born in Semlin (known, following subsequent population shifts, by its Serbian name as Zemun), at that time a mid-sized multi-ethnic town just outside Belgrade. Ludwig Barakovich, her father, ran a pharmacy. She was baptised as a Roman Catholic. Between 1913 and 1915 she was a student at the Graphic Design and Research Institute (\\"Grafische Lehr- und Versuchsanstalt\\") in Vienna. She combined this with work at the \\"Atelier d\`Ora\\", studying with Dora Kallmus (also known, professionally, as \\"Madame D'Ora\\"). With her formal training thus completed, in 1918 she was accepted for membership of the prestigious Vienna Photographic Society (\\"Wiener Photographische Gesellschaft\\" / PhG), and during 1918 she set up a little photography business, based till 1922 at one of two addresses in Vienna's 4th district (on the southside of the city centre). Her business was located in a fashionable quarter near the Vienna State Opera, and she produced society images, portraits and fashion shots. Celebrity subjects from the arts-world included Richard Strauss, Felix Salten and Alexander Lernet-Holenia. =Professional success cut short by the rise of Fascism= It was probably during the second part of the 1920s that Edith Barakovich married the Viennese author-screenwriter Paul Frank. They relocated together in 1930 to Berlin in connection with Paul Frank's work. Barakovich opened \\"\\"Atelier de Moda\\"\\", a small studio in the Friedrichstra√üe in the heart of city, from where she worked as a fashion photographer. Business was good until that morning during the first part of 1933 when they arrived to find a large stone in the middle of the floor and the shop window shattered. As it happened she would have almost precisely the same experience again, five years later, back in Vienna. After the National Socialists took power at the start of 1933 there was no longer any work for them in Germany, apparently for reasons of race, and they returned home to Vienna. However, early in 1938 Austria was incorporated into Nazi Germany. Edith Barakovich and her husband escaped to France. The French government was more generous than most about welcoming refugees from the racial policy of Nazi Germany, but unemployment was a major political and social problem for the Blum government. Work permits were hard to obtain, and the couple had no income apart from the small amount received in royalties from Paul Frank's film-scripts and novels. They went to Paris in order to try and obtain the visa needed to emigrate from France to the United States, but they were unsuccessful. =Escape from France= German armies invaded France from the north-east on 10 May 1940, capturing Paris (formally) on 14 June. For Frank and Edith it was time to quit the country: on 13 June they had joined the hundreds of thousands of Parisians fleeing south. There were four of them. They were accompanied by Paul Frank's mistress and muse, the photographer Lilly Joseph (1911 ‚Äì 2006), who had been with them since at least as far back as their time in Berlin. The fourth member of the party was Ida Cohn, Lilly's mother. They were still hoping to be able to emigrate to America. Ida had relatives in New York who would, she was confident, be able to help them with \\"the paperwork\\". Meanwhile they escaped by ship from Biarritz, travelling, in the first instance, to Spain where, following the recent conclusion of the country's brutal civil war, the government remained determined to avoid direct involvement in what was coming to be known as the Second World War. =Casablanca= They managed to cross Spain and reach Morocco, which at this time was being governed as a French protectorate on behalf of a puppet government operating at the behest of the German government. They found a small home in Casablanca. Lilly and her mother lived close by. Edith Barakovich waited with her husband, Paul Frank, for an affidavit which would open the way for their escape to the United States. Frank was able obtain a job teaching German at a refugee camp which provided a small income. Barakovich could not work. They had been required to leave most of their possessions behind when they fled Europe, but she had nevertheless managed to retain a small Leica camera. She took to following the packs of dogs out of town to the dunes where they congregated in the evenings, and photographing some of the individual animals, though she knew very well that she would never find anyone to buy the pictures. A friendly local who guided her to the largest of the dunes in the area explained that the packs of dogs had appeared during the Spanish Civil War when they had been able to feast on the bodies of dead escapees from Spain who had attempted to swim across from Tarifa or Algeciras, but drowned. Presumably, he implied, they were staying around in anticipation of rich pickings from the new war which they sensed was again approaching from the north. By the time Frank and Barakovich received entry visas for the USA, the exit visas that they needed to leave French Morocco had expired. They had to make a fresh application for new ones to the government in Vichy. Meanwhile Lilly Joseph and her mother finally obtained the necessary papers and left for New York. More alone than ever, Barakovich and Frank became increasingly desperate and depressed. Paul Frank took to drinking and lost his teaching job, after which they ran out of money. This was the situation in December 1940 when Edith Barakovich took her life with an overdose of Veronal. Three months later Paul Frank received the papers they had been waiting for and was able to travel to New York on a Spanish passenger ship. In 1942 he moved to the West Coast. He remarried. He would never again experience the professional success he had enjoyed in Vienna and Berlin, but he lived on till 1976.

The Sheepshanks was operated from the Altazimuth Pavilion from 1963 to 1982. Sheepshanks equatorial was a 6.7 inch (170 mm) refracting telescope established in 1838 at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. The telescope was donated to the observatory by Richard Sheepshanks. The telescope had an objective double lens made by Cauchoix of Paris, and it was about 8 feet long (2.4 meters). The telescope was originally mounted by Grubb on an equatorial mounting with a clockwork drive. The telescope overall rested on a stone pillar. From 1835 to 1963 it was in the Sheepshanks dome at the Greenwich observatory for the most part, and from 1963-1982 in the Altazimuth Pavilion. In the early 1980s it was placed in storage and has been there ever since. The telescope's Sheepshanks dome was in between the later Great Equatorial Building and the prime Meridian. The focal length of the telescope is about 1.9 meters (6.2 feet) in one source, and another says 8 feet 2 inches. The telescope tube was made of wood. An 1840 report from the Observatory noted of the new Sheepshanks telescope: Still in service over half a century later, an 1896 report by Christie, W. H. M. had this to say about the Sheepshanks at that time: One of the instruments for the telescope was a wire micrometer. The Sheepshanks refractor became the largest aperture telescope at Greenwich.  Observations  One of its observations was of Comet Encke. The Sheepshanks was used to observe the moon occulting stars in 1905. Some of the stars that were observed include Bradley 687, 130 Tauri, and 26 Geminorum- among others. In addition to the occultation of stars by the Moon, the Sheepshanks equatorial is also reported to have been used to observe the moons of Jupiter.

The exhibition showcased the work of eight artists who were known for portraying gritty scenes of daily life, especially of poorer communities in New York: Robert Henri, William Glackens, George Luks, Everett Shinn, John Sloan, Arthur Bowen Davies, Ernest Lawson, and Maurice Prendergast. Though they had varying styles, the artists were later known collectively as \\"The Eight\\". Henri, Glackens, Luks, Shinn, and Sloan were associated with the Ashcan School, and the 1908 exhibition brought increased national attention to that movement and founded their reputations.Richardson, E.

Background Ida mountains The region of Mount Ida got partially declared as a national park in 1993. It is rich with minerals (particularly gold and silver). According to media reports, the Turkish state is giving the Canadian mining company Alamos Gold Inc. land and mining rights for US$90 million. The state is therefore contractually involved with 4.5 percent of the gold yield of the mine. The project area is 20 km from Troja and 30 km from √áanakkale, at the foot of Kaz Dagi. The Ida Mountains are home to one of the largest contiguous forest areas in Turkey. The ruling party AKP, MHP and state authorities refuse any information about the planned work and its effects. Project In 2010, the Canadian company acquired the site for the planned Kirazli gold mine. Doƒüu Biga is the Turkish project partner of Alamos Gold. In 2017, Doƒüu Biga started on behalf of Alamos Gold to fell several thousand trees and remove the entire soil down to the bare rock. Around 200,000 trees have been cut so far, at least four times as much as permitted under the permit decision on the basis of the environmental impact assessment. According to observers, 20,000 tonnes of cyanides (hydrocyanic acid and other salts) are used for gold extraction and the drinking water supply of up to 24 communities is at risk. Protest In the mostly government-related Turkish media, it was not reported until the summer of 2019 on the extent of tree clearing and the destruction of vast unused natural areas. Only remote sensing images (satellite and drone pictures), commissioned by the environmental organization Tema, and further information were disseminated on social media in the summer of 2019. This led to broad protests in Turkey. Citizens and conservationists set up a protest camp near the cleared areas.

According to January 2020 press reports, his true identity is Amir Mohammed Abdul Rahman al-Mawli al-Salbi (). His appointment by a shura council was announced by ISIL media on 31 October 2019, less than a week after the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The U.S. Rewards for Justice Program is offering up to $10 million in exchange for information leading to al-Qurashi's apprehension.  Speculations about identity  At the time he was announced as the successor of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, little was known about al-Hashimi, but his Arabic onomastic (\\"nisbah\\"), al-Qurashi, suggested that he, like Baghdadi, claimed a lineage to Muhammad's tribe of Quraysh, a position that offers legitimacy in some quarters. Al-Hashimi's name was believed to be a nom de guerre and his real name was unknown at the time. The possibility that al- Hashimi was Amir Muhammad Sa‚Äôid Abdal Rahman al-Mawla was already raised on the day of al-Hashimi's coming to power, but this was uncertain at the time. Muhammad Ali Sajit, the brother-in-law and aide of Baghdadi caught in June 2019, also believed that \\"Hajji Abdullah\\", a top aide to al-Baghdadi, was al- Hashimi, the new leader. Rita Katz, director of SITE Intelligence Group, believed that it is unlikely that ISIL would \\"release any video speeches from this new leader or at least ones that show his face\\". Nonetheless, on 1 November 2019, United States president Donald Trump claimed on social media that the United States government had identified al-Hashimi's true identity. However, a report on 5 November 2019 by The National said that this \\"does not seem to be the case\\" and that \\"reports indicate that Iraqi, Kurdish and American officials say they don‚Äôt have much to go on\\". The Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center correctly speculated on 5 November that al- Hashimi was of Iraqi nationality. The Small Wars Journal agreed with this assessment, stating that Iraqis constitute the majority of ISIL members and would not accept a non-Iraqi leader for the organization. A report on 23 December by the Voice of America expressed doubt that al-Hashimi existed at all. It stated that ISIL was possibly caught off guard and announced a name as a holding move, to \\"create the impression it is on top of things\\". On 20 January 2020, The Guardian released a report confirming al-Hashimi's true identity as al-Mawla.  Biography  = Early life = Al-Hashimi was born on either 1 or 5 October 1976 as Amir Mohammed Abdul Rahman al-Mawli al-Salbi in Tel Afar, Iraq. He was born into an Iraqi Turkmen family, and educated in Sharia law at the University of Mosul. After graduating, he served as an army officer in Ba'athist Iraq. After the end of Saddam's rule following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, he joined Al-Qaeda and served as a religious commissary and a general Sharia jurist. In 2004, he was detained by US forces in Camp Bucca prison in southern Iraq where he met Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. He presumably re- joined Al-Qaeda after being released from prison at an unknown time. In 2014, al-Hashimi officially left al-Qaeda, reaffirming his loyalty to ISIL (which had previously operated as al-Qaeda's Iraqi branch). He played a key part in ISIL's capture of Mosul in June 2014. He was one of the main ISIL leaders who orchestrated the genocidal mass killings of Yazidis during the Sinjar massacre in August of that year. By this point, he had risen to deputy of Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi. According to ISIL, al-Hashimi is a veteran in fighting against Western nations, being a religiously educated and experienced commander. He was described as \\"the scholar, the worker, the worshiper\\", a \\"prominent figure in jihad\\", and an \\"emir of war\\". = Rise to power = Less than a week after the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, al-Hashimi was elected by a shura council as the new caliph of ISIL, indicating that the group still considers itself a caliphate despite having lost all of its territory in Iraq and Syria. Al- Hashimi's appointment was supposedly done in accordance with the advice of Baghdadi, meaning the new emir was named as a successor by Baghdadi himself. Further evidence that al-Hashimi may have been appointed as successor by Baghdadi may be inferred from the relatively quick succession of Baghdadi. Al- Hashimi's coming to power followed several days of speculation and denial surrounding Baghdadi's death among ISIL supporters. The general expectation was that al-Hashimi would become \\"the leader of a frayed organisation that has been reduced to scattered sleeper cells\\" and the ruler of a \\"caliphate of ashes\\". Some analysts believed that Baghdadi's death would likely cause ISIL to splinter, \\"leaving whoever emerges as its new leader with the task of pulling the group back together as a fighting force\\". However, other analysts believed that Baghdadi's death would not have much of an impact on ISIL \\"in terms of operational capacity\\" and that it was likely \\"not to result in the group‚Äôs demise, or really even bring about a decline\\". = Leader of ISIL = On 2‚Äì3 November, al-Hashimi's caliphacy was criticized as illegitimate by the al-Wafa‚Äô Media Agency, an online media outlet previously aligned with ISIL before turning against it in March 2019. It was argued that \\"the Prophet decreed obedience to leaders who exist and who are known ‚Ä¶ not obedience to a nonentity or an unknown\\". Further, it was argued that the council which elected al-Hashimi did not qualify as a legitimate since it lacked three qualifications for the caliph‚Äôs electors: justice, knowledge, and wisdom ‚Äì which the council lacked, since it had sent Baghdadi to Idlib, which had earlier deemed by them a \\"land of unbelief\\", when he \\"would have been much safer hiding in the desert\\". Further disqualifying the council was the fact that the council had \\"shed innocent Muslim blood and embraced extremism in the practice of excommunication\\" (takfir). As a final note, the al-Wafa‚Äô Media Agency stated that nothing was left for a would-be caliph to preside over ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou do not recognize that God has destroyed your state on account of your oppression.‚Äù In 2019, al-Hashimi received pledges of allegiance from ISIL's Sinai province and Bangladeshi affiliates (2 November), Somali province (3 November), Pakistani province and Yemen province (4 November), Hauran province and Khorasan Province (5 November), Tunisia province (6 November), West Africa province, Levant Province ‚Äì Homs, Levant Province ‚Äì al-Khayr, Levant Province ‚Äì Raqqa, East Asia Province and Central Africa Province (7 November), West Asia Province (8 November), West Africa Province ‚Äì Mali and Burkina Faso and Levant Province - al-Barakah (9 November), Levant Province ‚Äì Halab (12 November), Iraq Province ‚Äì Baghdad (14 November), Libya Province (15 November), Iraq Province ‚Äì Dijlah (16 November), Iraq Province ‚Äì Diyala (17 November), Iraq Province ‚Äì Salah al-Din (18 November), Iraq Province ‚Äì Kirkuk (19 November), East Asia Province ‚Äì Indonesia (22 November), Azerbaijani affiliates (29 November), and in 2020 from ISIL's Malian affiliates (31 January). These pledges of allegiance appeared to be intended to illustrate the legitimacy and unanimous acceptance of al-Hashimi, to counter criticism that he was unknown and illegitimate. Following an attack on the Tajikistan‚ÄìUzbekistan border that killed 17 people on 7 November, the attackers declared allegiance to al-Hashimi prior to the attack, according to journalist Rukmini Callimachi. On 23 December 2019, the Voice of America commented that al-Hashimi had \\"not provided visible leadership\\". In contrast, the United Nations Security Council judged in January 2020 that ISIL had undergone a resurgence in Iraq and Syria. Though these successes were partially attributed to al-Qurashi's leadership, he still remained a shadowy figure. The UN Security Council suggested that ISIL feared that al-Hashimi lacked some credentials that were usually necessary for a caliph, and kept him out of the spotlight as to not endanger his position. On 24 March 2020, the United States Department of State designated al-Hashimi as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) under Executive Order 13224. On 20 May 2020, Iraqi Intelligence Agency identified a captured militant as al-Hashimi; however, the military clarified that this was actually Abdul Nasser Qardash, a potential successor to al-Baghdadi. Al-Hashimi, the leader of ISIL, was still outside Iraqi custody at the time.

It is a complex network of interconnected entities, or \\"things\\", in the military domain that continually communicate with each other to coordinate, learn, and interact with the physical environment to accomplish a broad range of activities in a more efficient and informed manner. The concept of IoMT is largely driven by the idea that future military battles will be dominated by machine intelligence and cyber warfare and will likely take place in urban environments. By creating a miniature ecosystem of smart technology capable of distilling sensory information and autonomously governing multiple tasks at once, the IoMT is conceptually designed to offload much of the physical and mental burden that warfighters encounter in a combat setting. Over time, several different terms have been introduced to describe the use of IoT technology for reconnaissance, environment surveillance, unmanned warfare and other combat purposes. These terms include the Military Internet of Things (MIoT), the Internet of Battle Things, and the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT).  Overview  The Internet of Military Things encompasses a large range of devices that possess intelligent physical sensing, learning, and actuation capabilities through virtual or cyber interfaces that are integrated into systems. These devices include items such as sensors, vehicles, robots, UAVs, human-wearable devices, biometrics, munitions, armor, weapons, and other smart technology. In general, IoMT things can generally be classified into one of four categories: * Data- carrying device: A device attached to a physical thing that indirectly connects it to the larger communication network. * Data-capturing device: A reader/writer device capable of interacting with physical things. * Sensing and actuating device: A device that can detect or measure information related to the surrounding environment and converts it into a digital electronic signal or a physical operation. * General device: A device embedded with processing and communication capabilities that can exchange information with the larger network. In addition to connecting different electronic devices to a unified network, researchers have also suggested the possibility of incorporating inanimate and innocuous objects like plants and rocks into the system by fitting them with sensors that will turn them into information gathering points. Such efforts fall in line with projects related to the development of electronic plants, or e-Plants. Proposed examples of IoMT applications include tactical reconnaissance, smart management of resources, logistics support (i.e. equipment and supply tracking), smart city monitoring, and data warfare. Several nations, as well as NATO officials, have expressed Interest in the potential military benefits of IoT technology.  History  Advancements in IoMT technology largely stemmed from military efforts to bolster the development of sensor networks and low-power computing platforms during the 1960s for defense applications. During the Cold War, the U.S. military pioneered the use of wireless sensor network technologies to detect and track Soviet submarines. One example was the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS), a network of underwater acoustic sensors, i.e. hydrophones, placed throughout the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to act as underwater listening posts for above-ground facilities. Much of the sensor and networking technologies that the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) developed during this time period ultimately served as the foundation for modern IoT systems. Critically, the DoD helped set the stage for future IoT research in the late 1960s with the creation of ARPANET, an early precursor to the Internet that geographically-dispersed military scientists used to share data. In the 1980s, the Defense Advanced Projects Agency (DARPA) formally partnered with academic researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Carnegie Mellon University to further develop distributed, wireless sensor networks. From there, research into wireless sensor technologies spread throughout the civilian research community and eventually found use for industrial applications such as power distribution, wastewater treatment, and factory automation. During this time period, the DoD also invested heavily in the miniaturization of integrated circuits in order to embed various objects with tiny computer chips. As a result of their funding, the commercial microelectronics industry was able to recover when it faced potential decline at the time. By the late 1990s, the Department of Defense had announced plans for ‚Äúnetwork-centric‚Äù warfare that integrated the physical, information, and cognitive domains to enhance information sharing and collaboration. Examples of projects guided by this goal include the Nett Warrior (formerly known as the Ground Soldier System or Mounted Soldier System) and the Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below communication platform, both of which were prevalent in the early 2000s. However, interest in IoT research in the military started to wane as commercial industry surged ahead with new technology. While DoD continued research into advanced sensors, intelligent information processing systems, and communication networks, few military systems have taken full advantage of the IoT stack such as networked sensors and automated-response technology largely due to security concerns. As of 2019, research in modern IoT technology within the military started to regain a considerable amount of support from the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force.  Programs  Several initiatives were formed by the Department of Defense in order to bolster IoT research in the military domain as well as to reduce the current gap in progress between military and industry applications. = The Connected Soldier = The Connected Soldier project was a research initiative supported by the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) that focused on creating intelligent body gear. The project aimed to establish an internet of things for each troop by integrating wideband radio, biosensors, and wearable smart technology as part of the soldier's standard equipment. These devices served to not only monitor the soldier's physiological status but also communicate mission data, surveillance intelligence, and other important information to nearby military vehicles, aircraft, and other troops. = Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) = Internet of Battlefield Things technology in an unstructured, chaotic urban environment In 2016, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) created the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) project in response to the U.S. Army's operational outline for 2020 to 2040, titled ‚ÄúWinning in a Complex World.‚Äù In the outline, the Department of Defense announced its goals to keep up with the technological advances of potential adversaries by turning its attention away from low-tech wars and instead focusing on combat in more urban areas. Acting as a detailed blueprint for what ARL suspected future warfare may entail, the IoBT project pushed for better integration of IoT technology in military operations in order to better prepare for techniques such as electronic warfare that may lie ahead. In 2017, ARL established the Internet of Battlefield Things Collaborative Research Alliance (IoBT-CRA) to bring together industry, university, and government researchers to advance the theoretical foundations of IoBT systems. According to ARL, the IoBT was primarily designed to interact with the surrounding environment by acquiring information about the environment, acting upon it, and continually learning from these interactions. As a consequence, research efforts focused on sensing, actuation, and learning challenges. In order for the IoBT to function as intended, the following prerequisite conditions must first be met in regard to technological capability, structural organization, and military implementation.  Communication  All entities in the IoBT must be able to properly communicate information to one another even with differences in architectural design and makeup. While future commercial internet of things may exhibit a lack of uniform standards across different brands and manufacturers, entities in IoBT must remain compatible despite displaying extreme heterogeneity. In other words, all electronic equipment, technology, or other commercial offerings accessed by military personnel must share the same language or at least have ‚Äútranslators‚Äù that make the transfer and processing of different types of information possible. In addition, the IoBT must be capable of temporarily incorporating available networked devices and channels that it does not own for its own use, especially if doing so is advantageous to the system (e.g. making use of existing civilian networking infrastructure in military operations in a megacity). At the same time, the IoBT must take into consideration the varying degree of trustworthiness of all the networks it leverages. Timing will be critical in the success of IoBT. The speed of communication, computation, machine learning, inference, and actuation between entities are vital to many mission tasks, as the system must know which type of information to prioritize. Scalability will also serve as an important factor in the operation since the network must be flexible enough to function at any size.  Learning  The success of the IoBT framework often hinges on the effectiveness of the mutual collaboration between the human agents and the electronic entities in the network. In a tactical environment, the electronic entities will be tasked with a wide range of objectives from collecting information to executing cyber actions against enemy systems. In order for these technologies to perform those functions effectively, they must be able to not only ascertain the goals of the human agents as they change but also demonstrate a significant level of autonomous self-organization to adjust to the rapidly changing environment. Unlike commercial network infrastructures, the adoption of IoT in the military domain must take into consideration the extreme likelihood that the environment may be intentionally hostile or unstable, which will require a high degree of intelligence to navigate. As a result, the IoBT technology must be capable of incorporating predictive intelligence, machine learning, and neural network in order to understand the intent of the human users and determine how to fulfill that intent without the process of micromanaging each and every component of the system. According to ARL, maintaining information dominance will rely on the development of autonomous systems that can operate outside its current state of total dependence on human control. A key focus of IoBT research is the advancement of machine learning algorithms to provide the network with decision-making autonomy. Rather than having one system at the core of the network functioning as the central intelligence component dictating the actions of the network, the IoBT will have intelligence distributed throughout the network. Therefore, individual components can learn, adapt, and interact with each other locally as well as update behaviors and characteristics automatically and dynamically on a global scale to suit the operation as the landscape of warfare constantly evolves. In the context of IoT, the incorporation of artificial intelligence into the sheer volume of data and entities involved in the network will provide an almost infinite number of possibilities for behavior and technological capability in the real world. In a tactical environment, the IoBT must be able to perform various types of learning behaviors to adapt to the rapidly changing conditions. One area that received considerable attention is the concept of meta-learning, which strives to determine how machines can learn how to learn. Having such a skill would allow the system to avoid fixating on pretrained absolute notions on how it should perceive and act whenever it enters a new environment. Uncertainty quantification models have also generated interest in IoBT research since the system's ability to determine its level of confidence in its own predictions based on its machine learning algorithms may provide some much needed context whenever important tactical decisions need to be made. The IoBT should also demonstrate a sophisticated level of situation awareness and artificial intelligence that will allow the system to autonomously perform work based on limited information. A primary goal is to teach the network how to correctly infer the complete picture of a situation while measuring relatively few variables. As a result, the system must be capable of integrating the vast amount and variety of data that it regularly collects into its collective intelligence while functioning in a continuous state of learning at multiple time scales, simultaneously learning from past actions while acting in the present and anticipating future events. The network must also account for unforeseen circumstances, errors, or breakdowns and be able to reconfigure its resources to recover at least a limited level of functionality. However, some components must be prioritized and structured to be more resilient to failure than others. For instance, networks that carry important information such as medical data must never be at risk of shutdown.  Cognitive Accessibility  For semi-autonomous components, the human cognitive bandwidth serves as a notable constraint for the IoBT due to its limitations in processing and deciphering the flood of information generated by the other entities in the network. In order to obtain truly useful information in a tactical environment, semi-autonomous IoBT technologies must collect an unprecedented volume of data of immense complexity in levels of abstraction, trustworthiness, value, and other attributes. Due to serious limitations in human mental capacity, attention, and time, the network must be able to easily reduce and transform large flows of information produced and delivered by the IoBT into reasonably-sized packets of essential information that is significantly relevant to army personnel, such as signals or warnings that pertain to their current situation and mission. A key risk of IoBT is the possibility that devices could communicate negligibly useful information that eats up the human's valuable time and attention or even propagate inappropriate information that misleads human individuals into performing actions that lead to adverse or unfavorable outcomes. At the same time, the system will stagnate if the human entities doubt the accuracy of the information provided by the IoBT technology. As a result, the IoBT must operate in a manner that is extremely convenient and easy to understand to the humans without compromising the quality of the information it provides them. = Mosaic Warfare = Mosaic Warfare is a term coined by former DARPA Strategic Technology Office director Tom Burns and former deputy director Dan Patt to describe a ‚Äúsystems of systems‚Äù approach to military warfare that focuses on re-configuring defense systems and technologies so that they can be fielded rapidly in a variety of different combinations for different tasks. Designed to emulate the adaptable nature of the lego blocks and mosaic art form, Mosaic Warfare was promoted as a strategy to confuse and overwhelm adversary forces by deploying low-cost adaptable technological expendable weapon systems that can play multiple roles and coordinate actions with one another, complicating the decision-making process for the enemy. This method of warfare arose as a response to the current monolithic system in the military, which relies on a centralized command-and-control structure fraught with vulnerable single-point communications and the development of a few highly capable systems that are too important to risk losing in combat. The concept of Mosaic Warfare existed within DARPA since 2017 and contributed to the development of various technology programs such as the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSIT), which led to the development of a network system that allows previously disjointed ground stations and platforms to transmit and translate data between one another. = Ocean of Things = In 2017, DARPA announced the creation of a new program called the Ocean of Things, which planned to apply IoT technology on a grand scale in order to establish a persistent maritime situational awareness over large ocean areas. According to the announcement, the project would involve the deployment of thousands of small, commercially available floats. Each float would contain a suite of sensors that collect environmental data‚Äîlike ocean temperature and sea state‚Äîand activity data, such as the movement of commercial vessels and aircraft. All the data collected from these floats would then be transmitted periodically to a cloud network for storage and real-time analysis. Through this approach, DARPA aimed to create an extensive sensor network that can autonomously detect, track, and identify both military, commercial, and civilian vessels as well as indicators of other maritime activity. The Ocean of Things project focused primarily on the design of the sensor floats and the analytic techniques that would be involved in organizing and interpreting the incoming data as its two main objectives. For the float design, the vessel had to be able to withstand the harsh ocean conditions for at least a year while being made out of commercially available components that cost less than $500 each in total. In addition, the floats could not pose any danger to passing vessels and had to be made out of environmentally safe materials so that it could safely dispose of itself in the ocean after completing its mission. In regards to the data analytics, the project concentrated on developing cloud-based software that could collect, process, and transmit data about the environment and their own condition using a dynamic display.  Security Concerns  One of the largest potential dangers of IoMT technology is the risk of both adversarial threats and system failures that could compromise the entire network. Since the crux of the IoMT concept is to have every component of the network‚Äîsensors, actuators, software, and other electronic devices‚Äîconnected together to collect and exchange data, poorly protected IoT devices are vulnerable to attacks which may expose large amounts of confidential information. Furthermore, a compromised IoMT network is capable of causing serious, irreparable damage in the form of corrupted software, disinformation, and leaked intelligence. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, security remains a top priority in IoT research. The IoMT must be able to foresee, avoid, and recover from attempts by adversary forces to attack, impair, hijack, manipulate, or destroy the network and the information that it holds. The use of jamming devices, electronic eavesdropping, or cyber malware may pose a serious risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information within the network. Furthermore, the human entities may also be targeted by disinformation campaigns in order to foster distrust in certain elements of the IoMT. Since IoMT technology may be used in an adversarial setting, researchers must account for the possibility that a large number of sources may become compromised to the point where threat-assessing algorithms may use some of those compromised sources to falsely corroborate the veracity of potentially malicious entities. Minimizing the risks associated with IoT devices will likely require a large-scale effort by the network to maintain impenetrable cybersecurity defenses as well as employ counterintelligence measures that thwart, subvert, or deter potential threats. Examples of possible strategies include the use of ‚Äúdisposable‚Äù security, where devices that are believed to be potentially compromised by the enemy are simply discarded or disconnected from the IoMT, and honeynets that mislead enemy eavesdroppers. Since adversary forces are expected to adapt and evolve their strategies for infiltrating the IoMT, the network must also undergo a continuous learning process that autonomously improves anomaly detection, pattern monitoring, and other defensive mechanisms. Secure data storage serves as one of the key points of interest for IoMT research. Since the IoMT system is predicted to produce an immense volume of information, attention was directed toward new approaches to maintaining data properly and regulating protected access that don't allow for leaks or other vulnerabilities. One potential solution that was proposed by The Pentagon was Comply to Connect (C2C), a network security platform that autonomously monitored device discovery and access control in order to keep pace with the exponentially- growing network of entities. In addition to the risks of digital interference and manipulation by hackers, concerns have also been expressed regarding the availability of strong wireless signals in remote combat locations. The lack of a constant internet connection was shown to limit the utility and usability of certain military devices that depend on reliable reception.

He competed at multiple world championship level sailing events, including the America's Cup, the Whitbread Round The World Race and Admiral's Cup race series. In 1989, English skippered Ireland's first entry to take part in the Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race. Born into a seafaring family in Cobh, County Cork, English became an internationally successful yacht-racing captain and long distance offshore competitor. English was involved in the development of the sport of sailing in Ireland, from an amateur hobby into a full-time profession. In the 2014 Irish Examiner obituary, he was described as The People's Skipper.  Career English had early success in the laser (dinghy) class. He won the Irish Yachting Association Junior Helmsman championship in 1974 and represented Ireland at the Youth World Sailing Championships in Largs, Scotland in 1975. English competed in the 1977 Admiral's Cup boat Big Apple, and on board Moonduster for the 1979 Fastnet race. After sailing aboard Blizzard in the 1979 Southern Cross Cup, English emigrated to Sydney, Australia. During the 1980s, he competed in international events including the Admirals Cup, Southern Cross Cup, the Clipper Cup, Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, San Francisco Big Boat Series, Antigua Sailing Week Series and several Middle Sea Race events, including an ARC across the Atlantic. In 1981, along with friend Harold Cudmore, English won the Two Ton Cup and One Ton Cup aboard Hitchhiker and Justine 3 respectively. In 1988 English joined the British campaign in the 1988 Kenwood Cup in Hawaii. Later, English raced on Maxi yachts in Southern Hemisphere events such as the Sydney Hobart Race and the Southern Cross Series, including two Pacific Ocean passages as Skipper on Syd Fischer's Ragamuffin. English took part in various Admiral's Cup Teams. In addition to sailing on Irish entrants in 1977, 1987, and Skippering Jameson 3 in 1993, he also competed with the Japanese in 1981 and on board Dihard the Papa New Guinea entrance in the 1983 edition of the Admirals cup.http://forums.sailinganarchy.com/index.php?/topic/113002-1983-australian- admirals-cup-trials-1980-clipper-cup/  America's Cup In the America's Cup, English was involved in several Australian syndicates during the 1980s. In 1982, he joined Hugh Treharne's sailmaking team, to become part of the Australia II America's Cup Campaign.http://covesailingclub.ie/wp- content/uploads/2019/10/Cove-Sailing-Club-Yearbook-2019.pdf In 1986 he then joined the James Hardy backed 'South Australia' syndicate as mainsheet trimmer for the defence of the 1987 America's Cup. South Australia (KA8) was a sister ship of Australia III, also designed by Ben Lexcen, although she performed quite differently in the 1986 12 Metre World Championships.http://www.12mrclass.com/yachts/detail/273-itemId.511707139.html English then campaigned during the 1987 Defender Selection Series with Syd Fischer on Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron Steak 'n' Kidney . English was made an Australian citizen for his America's Cup exploits. In 2001 English took part in the America's Cup Jubilee regatta in Cowes, Isle of wight for the UBS Jubilee Around the Island race.https://www.sail-world.com/Australia/Americas- Cup-Jubilee-2001/-3188?source=google  Whitbread Round the World Yacht Races  In 1989 English returned to Ireland to skipper the 82 foot, Ron Holland Maxi yacht NCB Ireland, Ireland's first entry in the 1989‚Äì1990 Whitbread Round the World Race. Irish national expectations for the boats success ran high, but race leg wins were eclipsed by other teams, including the Peter Blake (sailor) led Steinlager 2 entry that dominated the race. Gear and equipment failure dogged the Irish campaign. In the 31,500-mile race, noted for risk of loss of life and boat, NCB Ireland finished 11th out of a 23 strong fleet. He then raced in the 1993‚Äì1994 Whitbread Round the World Race on ‚ÄôTokio‚Äô with Chris Dickson (sailor) and latterly with Toshiba (yacht) for the 1997‚Äì1998 Whitbread Round the World Race which was led by Dennis Conner and Paul Standbridge.https://afloat.ie/sail/sailing-clubs/howth-yacht- club/item/14445-joe-english-lunch-in-howth Toshiba's crew had 13 Whitbread and 28 America's Cup campaigns between them. English then subsequently became an adviser to the race management team and latterly served on the Whitbread executive committee until 2001 as it evolved into the Volvo Ocean Race. In 1991 Ireland won the Southern Cross Cup when English skippered the yacht Extension to Victory.. Businessman John Storey entered a three boat Irish team to take part in the Southern Cross Series of that year, which was a programme of inshore and offshore races of varying length culminating in the 630-mile Sydney-Hobart Race. Ireland would also win the Sydney-Hobart on Storey's Atara.https://afloat.ie/blogs/sailing-saturday-with-wm-nixon/item/44897-howth- yacht-club-returns-to-new-sydney-hobart-challenge In 1993 Ireland qualified a 3 boat team for the Admiral's Cup of that year, backed by John Storey and sponsored by Jameson Whiskey. Jameson 3 (Skippered by English) was the largest boat (50 feet) in the Irish team, but she was disqualified in race 6 and failed to finish race 7, the Fastnet. The team was bolstered by a strong showing by Jameson 2, which finished third overall, but were severely hampered by Jameson 1 (Skippered by Harold Cudmore) which had to retire from the regatta when she sank after striking Gurnard Ledge in the first race. The Irish team finished seventh overall.http://rbsailing.blogspot.com/2012/10/featured-yacht-jameson-3.html https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/sailing-sudden-impact-for-cudmore-hugh- bateson-on-the-perils-which-can-rock-even-the-experienced-1488125.html In 1994, with members of the Royal Cork Yacht Club English led the development of the 1720 Sportsboat, one of the world‚Äôs first boat classes aimed at delivering affordable and fun racing for local club level sailors. From 1994 until 2004, 114 hulls were manufactured in O'Sullivan Marine Tralee, Co. Kerry. In 1997 he won the Round the Island Race in Cowes on his own 1720 Sportsboat. https://www.independent.ie/sport/its-not-plain-sailing-for-those-who-sit-in- judgement-26201246.html In 1999 English sailed aboard the Italian yacht Riveria di Rimini for the Middle Sea Race and subsequently placed second in the 1999 Fasnet Race. In 1999 English joined UK MacWilliam Sailmakers in Crosshaven, Co. Cork.  Later life and illness  In 2007, aged 51, English was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and retired as a professional yachtsman. He was the youngest person in the country with the illness at the time. In 2011, English took part in the Ocean Legends Regatta in Alicante, Spain for the start of the 2011‚Äì2012 Volvo Ocean Race.https://myisa.sailing.ie/ISANews/tabid/115/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/15063/Volvo- Ocean-Race-Legends-Regatta.aspx Following the establishment of the Joe English Trust, with fellow America's Cup sailor, John Bertrand (sailor, born 1946),English became an advocate and campaigner for better solutions to treat and manage Alzheimer's disease, by meeting the President of Ireland to highlight the cause and participating in an RT√â Television programme in association with the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland. Highlighting the impact of the disease on sufferers and their families. He died on 4 November 2014 aged 58. His daughter Aoife, is a world champion sailor.

Some of her well known works include the series E-String and So It Goes.... Her work is featured in the anthology Dyke Strippers: Lesbian Cartoonists A to Z. Early life and education Karen Favreau was born in Gardner, Massachusetts on July 29, 1968. She graduated from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with a bachelor's degree in Sociology. Favreau then went on to earn two master's degrees in Library and Information Studies and Counseling and Educational Development from the University of North Carolina (UNCG) in Greensboro. While getting her degree in counseling, she received the Marian Pope Franklin Fellowship Award. During her time at UNCG, Favreau joined honor societies Beta Phi Mu and Chi Sigma Iota. As a member of Chi Sigma Iota, Favreau became an academic coordinator for the organization at North Carolina A&T; State University, and as a senior administrator helped in the creation of the Counselor's Bookshelf, as well as contributed as one of its first editors. Career Favreau was known for her one-panel comics, ranging from light-hearted jokes to more politically focused events. Many of her works were published in newspapers and magazines such as Funny Times, Nerve, and Factsheet Five. She drew over one-hundred comics during her career. E-String focused on a variety of topics in America and was featured in many newspapers across the country. In the So It Goes... series, she brought up the issue of LGBT stereotypes to comment on how straight, and usually white people, treated the community. The Breakup and The Tourists were comics that focused on lesbianism, but were not a part of the series. These comics showed the vast spectrum of Favreau's comedic creativity while also bringing awareness of stereotypes about lesbians. Later on, Favreau moved from LGBT-focused comics to ones that dealt with a wide-range of topics and humor. Favreau taught a Cartooning 101 course at UNCG's All Arts, Sciences, and Technology Camp, and also worked as a library manager at the Central North Carolina Regional Library system. During a time of spiritual journey, she published Ridiculous Packaging: Or, My Long, Strange Journey from Atheist to Episcopalian, In Two Acts in 2005.

The El Mirador Tower is still a landmark at the entrance to the Hospital.militarymuseum.org, Torney General Hospital History =El Mirador Hotel= The El Mirador Hotel opened on December 31, 1927 as 20 acres Desert Resort. The hotel was built by Prescott Thresher Stevens and the Los Angeles architect firm of Walker & Eisen. El Mirador Hotel was busy spot visited by Hollywood stars and the wealthy. At the 1928 opening were: Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and Lillian Gish. The hotel had an open policy, frequent guests were Marx Brothers, Al Jolson and Albert Einstein. The hotel had Spanish-Colonial Revival-style bell tower, 200 rooms, tennis courts, Olympic swimming pool, horse stables, and a golf course. El Mirador is Spanish for watchtower. The 120-acre golf course was California' first desert golf course. Stevens built the hotel at a cost of one million dollars. The good times at the hotel ended with the Wall Street Crash on October 24, 1929. Stevens sold the hotel at loss for $300,000 in 1932. Purchased by bondholders Tony Burke and Frank Bogert, the new owners publicized Palm Springs and the hotel as an international playground. Amos 'n' Andy show was broadcast from the Hotel in the early 1930s. =Torney General Hospital= The US Army purchased the El Mirador Hotel in July 1942 and rebuilt the 139 acre complex as a 1600-bed general hospital. A year later, in 1943, the Army transferred the hospital to the Army Air Forces. Torney General Hospital was named after George H. Torney (1850‚Äì1913), physician in the United States Navy and Army who served as the 21st Surgeon General of the United States Army. Torney General Hospital was used for general medicine, with specialized care for rheumatic fever, general surgery and orthopedic surgery. The hospital supported the Desert Training Center, other California training camps and troops returning home from overseas. With a shortage of manpower, 250 men with the Italian Service Unit worked at the hospital. A Women's Army Corps Detachment also worked at the hospital.

Her dissertation was titled Atmospheric ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy.  Career  Lean worked at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences and the Applied Research Research Corporation in Maryland. In 1988, she joined the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) as a research physicist in the Space Science Division. She is a senior scientist for Sun-Earth System Research at the NRL. = Research = Lean's research focuses on the mechanisms, measurements, modeling, and forecasting of variations in the Sun's radiative output at all wavelengths, and responses to this variability of the Earth's global climate, middle atmosphere, and space climate and weather. This research advances understanding of variations in the extended operational environment that can affect Naval assets and activities. She has been an Investigator for NASA and NOAA research grants, including the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, Living with a Star, Sun-Earth Connection and Glory Science Team, and NOAA's Climate Data Stewardship programs. Lean is a co-investigator on three NASA satellite missions, the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment, Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics, and the Solar Dynamics Observatory. She currently leads NRL's Integrating the Sun-Earth System (ISES) Accelerated Research Initiative. Lean has authored or co-authored 117 refereed journal papers and 34 conference proceedings in the scientific literature. She has delivered over 290 presentations at scientific meetings, seminars, colloquia, and lectures. Lean was also a lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) Report, which was recognized with the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize; she has served on many NRC and NASA committees, including the recent NRC Decadal Surveys of Earth Science and Applications and Solar and Space Physics. In 2014, the following two of her papers selected for publication in Geophysical Research Letters Top 40 edition. * * The 1995 paper was published, Lean explains, at a time when there was a lot of speculation about how much solar variability may have influenced climate change in recent centuries. The research by Lean, Beer, and Bradley provided a new way to numerically estimate past changes in total and ultraviolet solar irradiance based on contemporary records observed from satellites, combined with estimates of long-term solar variability reported (at the time) in Sun-like- stars. With this new reconstruction of historical solar irradiance since 1610, scientists could quantitatively estimate the Sun's contribution to global surface temperature changes. Lean and her colleagues found that the Sun may have contributed half of the changes since 1610 and less than a third of the changes since 1970, contrary to earlier research suggesting that the Sun may be entirely responsible. This meant that solar variability was not the primary cause of global warming in the past decades. Since the 1995 paper, many climate change studies have used the irradiance reconstruction for a variety of analyses and as input to climate model simulations. Although subsequent work with NRL co-authors Yi-Ming Wang and Neil Sheeley has since revised the magnitude of the total irradiance change during the past four centuries, the overall approach and methodology were first established in this 1995 GRL paper, which has been cited more than 600 times. The 2011 paper, written with primary author Gregg Kopp, Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP), was published eight years after the 2003 launch on the Solar Radiation and Climate (SORCE) spacecraft; SORCE carried a new LASP-designed instrument that measured total solar irradiance with superior accuracy and precision. The new observations showed that the absolute value of total solar irradiance (during solar minimum conditions) was 1360.8 instead of 1365.4 W per m-2. Scientists had assumed the higher value was correct for over a decade. That higher value was typically used in climate model simulations and other applications needing to know the amount of energy the Sun provides to the Earth. Initially, most scientists thought that the new lower value was an error, but after exhaustive laboratory testing and re-calibrations, researchers determined that the lower value, not the higher value, was closer to the true value of total solar irradiance. This new lower value has since been confirmed by additional space-based radiometer measurements. As well, the new measurements from the SORCE spacecraft, which are not only more accurate but also more precise than prior observations, enabled the generation of a new model of solar irradiance variability, and an assessment of the contributions of solar variability to global change in the recent three decades, finding that although a solar cycle signal of 0.1 ¬∞C is detachable in the global climate record, solar variability is not a primary cause of recent global warming of about 0.4 ¬∞C from 1980 to 2010.

The two teams expected to be eliminated, the Minnesota Twins and the Montreal Expos, cast the dissenting votes. According to Commissioner Bud Selig, the decision was made due to economic reasons, as \\"the teams to be contracted [had] a long record of failing to generate enough revenues to operate a viable major league franchise.\\" Also factoring into the contraction plan was the two teams' inability to fund the construction of new ballparks to replace the outdated Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and Olympic Stadium. The contraction plan fell through due to a court injunction compelling the Twins to honor their lease with the Metrodome, as well as challenges by the players' labor union, the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA). The Expos were later purchased by Major League Baseball. The Twins would eventually secure funding for a new stadium that opened in 2010, while the Expos relocated to Washington, D.C. and were re-branded the Washington Nationals, later being purchased by Ted Lerner and moving to a new stadium of their own. If the plan had gone through, it would have been the first contraction by a major North American professional sports league since the National Hockey League merged the Cleveland Barons into the Minnesota North Stars in 1978, and the first contraction by Major League Baseball since 1899. Background =Minnesota Twins= The Minnesota Twins began playing at the Metrodome in the 1982 season after playing for 21 seasons at Metropolitan Stadium. During their tenure at the Metrodome, the Twins won the World Series in and . Nevertheless, the multipurpose stadium, which the Twins shared with the Minnesota Vikings of the NFL, had poor sightlines when the field was set for baseball, and the Twins received no revenue from signage, luxury suites, or parking. Additionally, the white, air-supported roof not only caused many fielders to have trouble tracking fly balls, but it also deflated due to heavy snow on numerous occasions.Historical April Snowstorms By the start of the 1990s, the Metrodome was already considered obsolete. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the Twins were often rumored to be moving to such places as Sacramento, California; Orlando, Florida; Nashville, Tennessee; and others in search of a more financially competitive market. In 1997, the team came close to an agreement to move to North Carolina, but the deal was not completed. =Montreal Expos= Olympic Stadium was originally constructed as a multipurpose venue for the 1976 Summer Olympics, which Montreal hosted. The Montreal Expos began playing full-time at the stadium in the 1977 season, one year after the stadium's opening and the team's ninth year of play. Although the new stadium was an upgrade from Jarry Park Stadium, Olympic Stadium was still fraught with problems. A retractable roof that was scheduled to be finished when the Expos moved in was not finished until 1987, and began to leak within only a few years. In 1991, support beams collapsed and a 55-ton slab of concrete crashed onto a walkway outside the stadium, forcing the Expos to play their final 13 home games that year on the road. The stadium's poor conditions contributed to low attendance in Montreal. Throughout the 1990s, the Expos ranked near the bottom in the NL for attendance, including ranking last in each of their final seven seasons in Montreal. Owner Jeffrey Loria was unable to reach an agreement for television and English-speaking radio coverage to increase the team's broadcasting revenue, and his proposal for a new downtown ballpark was rebuffed by the Quebec government. Owners vote for contraction On November 6, 2001, the day before the active MLB labor agreement expired, MLB franchise owners met in Chicago to vote on contraction, despite earlier reports that no such vote would take place. The owners voted 28‚Äì2 in favor of contraction. Although the Florida Marlins, Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Oakland Athletics had been discussed as candidates for elimination, the Expos and Twins were considered the likeliest teams to be folded. The owners of both teams were set to receive $250 million buyouts to let MLB take control of and fold their franchises. Aftermath Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) executive director Donald Fehr noted that the players' union had no say in the matter and called the decision \\"imprudent and unfortunate...We had hoped that we were in a new era, one that would see a much better relationship between players and owners. Today's announcement is a severe blow to such hopes.\\" The MLBPA filed a grievance to block contraction the day after the vote. On November 16, the league's contraction plans were shelved when Hennepin County Judge Harry Crump ruled that the Minnesota Twins must honor their lease and play their final season at the Metrodome, citing the team's importance to the community. Had only the Expos been contracted, there would have been an odd number of teams in the two leagues, meaning one team would have to be idle every day. This would have made it all but impossible to preserve a 162-game schedule within the normal six-month season. By December 13, talks about contraction had ended, and on January 12, 2002, it was announced that no teams would be eliminated for the upcoming season. On January 16, Loria sold the Expos to Major League Baseball for $120 million. MLB formed Expos Baseball L.P., a partnership of the other 29 clubs, to operate the Expos. Loria then bought the Florida Marlins from John W. Henry for $158 million, using the proceeds from the Expos sale plus a $38.5 million no-interest loan from MLB. Henry then bought the Boston Red Sox from the Yawkey Trust.From 2002 ESPN Information Please Sports Almanac, Business and Media section It was officially announced on February 5 that plans for contraction had been abandoned. On August 30, the owners and players approved a new collective bargaining agreement that forbade contraction until 2006. With no plans for a new ballpark in Montreal, Major League Baseball looked into relocating the Expos. Cities that expressed interest in the team included Washington, D.C.; Las Vegas, Nevada; Norfolk, Virginia; Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico; and Portland, Oregon. On September 29, 2004, Major League Baseball announced that the Expos would relocate to Washington, D.C. for the 2005 season. MLB owners voted 28‚Äì1 in favor of the move, with the Baltimore Orioles casting the lone dissenting vote. The team, rebranded as the Washington Nationals, played their first three seasons at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium before moving into the newly-constructed Nationals Park in 2008. On May 26, 2006, after years of failed proposals, Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty signed a bill that approved funding for a new $522 million ballpark, to which the Twins agreed to contribute $130 million. The new stadium, named Target Field, opened in April 2010.

Life and career All Saints Church, Drimoleague, West Cork (1954-1956) Cork Distillers Bottling plant, 1964 Murphy was born in Cork, Ireland in 1916. He graduated from University College Dublin's School of Architecture in 1939, and the following year established an architectural practice in Cork city. Murphy was influenced by both Scandinavian and American architecture, and his work featured complex surfaces as well as curtain wall facades. While the former is particularly present in his storefront designs, the latter international style is reflected in projects such as Thompson's Bakery and the Cork Distillers Company Bottling plant. Murphy's work include churches, factories, offices, housing and shopfronts, some of which employ varied and sometimes \\"eccentric\\" material palettes. In 1956, Murphy designed West Cork's first modernist building, All saints Church in Drimoleague, and Cork city's first purpose-built office building 'Sutton House' in 1966. In 1968, Murphy was alarmed at the destruction and demolition of Cork City's built heritage and set up the Cork Preservation Society. In 1975, during the European Architectural Heritage Year, he was awarded the European Award for Architecture, the Europa Nostra Medal, by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland for his restoration of Skiddy's Almshouse.

It was surrounded by walled formal gardens, typical of the period, as shown on the map of 1700. The grounds included a canal, a garden building (possibly incorporating the remnant of the mediaeval parish church), parterres and topiary.http://www.breckslandscape.co.uk/caseBuckenham.php Samuel Vincent was an entrepreneur and land speculator in London, who was associated with the great and unscrupulous Nicholas Barbon, a self-made man who \\"dominated the late 17th century London building world\\".The Birth of Modern London: The Development and Design of the City 1660-1720 By Elizabeth McKellar, p.46 The Great Fire of London in 1666 had opened up great opportunities for building developers.

Barbon explained the principle of the business as follows to a correspondent in 1684:A Letter to a Gentleman in the Country, Giving an Account of the Two Insurance - Offices; the Fire-Office & Friendly-Society (1684) :\\"The fund or securities are these: that of the Fire Office is ground rents to the Value of fifty thousand pounds, setled upon trustees, to make good all losses from fire; and to be increased, as the number of houses insured increase. The strength of this security stands upon this supposition, that the fund is so large, considering the houses insured are dispersed at several distances, that it is very improbable (unless the whole City be destroyed at once) that any loss at one time should exceed the fund; and then it will be alwayes the interest of the insurers (as of men that have Morgaged their Land for less than the Value) to pay the debt when called for, to prevent a greater loss, since the land is of more value than the debt\\". In 1686 the company (described as \\"The Fire Office\\" or \\"Samuel Vincent, Nicholas Barbon and their partners for the insurance of houses from fire\\") sought to obtain a patent for the exclusive use of the \\"invention\\" of fire insurance.William Robert Scott, The Constitution and Finance of English, Scottish and Irish Joint-Stock Companies to 1720, Vol 3, Cambridge, 1911, p.375 In 1688 it was granted a patent or incorporation papers by King James II and adopted the symbol of a phoenix to be displayed as a \\"fire mark\\" on all insured houses, which would be recognised by its fleet of fire-engines in case of a fire breaking out.

St Andrew's Church Blomefield (1738) commented: \\"The Church has been so long demolished, that the very site of it is not known; it is said to be about the upper end of the canal in the gardens, near the garden-house; it was dedicated to St. Andrew, and there was in it the image of our Lady, as appears from an old will that I have seen, wherein a legacy was given to repair her perke\\" (a pedestal and niche that she stood in).Blomefield Evacuation During the Second World War, the manor house was taken over by the British Army when it was incorporated into the 30,000 acre Stanford Battle Area.

In 1941 he retired early in order to devote himself better to this task. After the project leader Paul Hermann Ruth, who died in the Second World War, was called up, G√ºlzow took over the overall management. He did valuable detailed work in researching Arndt's life and work, but also put himself at the service of National Socialism. After the end of the war, numerous research materials on Ernst Moritz Arndt were lost or destroyed. In October 1948 G√ºlzow made an attempt to re-establish the Arndt society, but was ultimately unsuccessful. G√ºlzow died in Barth at age 66.

He is best known for being the Zuikaku's dive bomber squadron during the Battle of the Eastern Solomons and the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. He survived the war and later served in the Japan Self-Defense Forces. Early career Sadamu Takahashi enrolled in the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in April 1930 and graduated from 61st class in November 1933. In April 1935, he was commissioned as an Ensign, and in November was selected for a navy pilot training program at Kasumigaura Training Naval Air Station (NAS). After completion of the course, he was promoted to Lieutenant Junior Grade in December 1936 and was then assigned as to ≈åmura NAS on Kyushu, where he received advanced training on dive bombing. In 1937, he was transferred to China and assigned to 12th Air Group, where he participated in several aerial operations during the Second Sino-Japanese War, including around Shanghai and Nanjing. In December, he was recalled to Japan to serve as an instructor at Kasumigaura NAS. In November 1938, Takahashi was promoted to full Lieutenant and was transferred to Ry≈´j≈ç in December, where he was appointed flight division leader (buntaich≈ç) in the dive bomber squadron. In October 1939, he was reassigned to 14th Air Group and participated in several operations in Southern China. In November 1940, he became one of the flight division leaders of Tsukuba Air Group. Pacific War In the beginning of 1942, he was assigned to the 31st Air Group as a dive bomber squadron leader. In February, his squadron operated from Nichols Field in the Philippines and participated in the attacks on the US troops during the Bataan and the Corregidor. In June, he was transferred to the carrier Zuikaku and became its group commander (hik≈çtaich≈ç), as well as its dive bomber squadron leader. In late August 1942, Lieutenant Takahashi participated in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons. He led 27 Aichi D3A dive bombers in the second strike wave against United States Navy (USN) fleet. His strike was escorted by nine Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters led by Lieutenant Ayao Shirane. They could not, however, locate the enemy carriers, as his radio failed to receive a report on their updated position. Some of the D3A pilots in his group did receive the radio message, but assumed that Takahashi had received it too and said nothing. Nevertheless, the carrier Enterprise was badly damaged by the first wave strike under the command of Lieutenant Commander Mamoru Seki. Takahashi only learned about the report, which may have allowed him to finish off Enterprise, after he landed back on Zuikaku that evening. In late October 1942, Lieutenant Takahashi participated in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, where he led 21 Aichi D3A dive bombers in the first strike wave against the US carriers. The strike was under the overall command of Lieutenant Commander Shigeharu Murata, while escort was provided by A6M Zeros led by Lieutenant Moriyasu Hidaka from Zuih≈ç and Lieutenant Ayao Shirane from Zuikaku. During the attack, his D3A was intercepted by the enemy Combat Air Patrol of Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters. He was able to shake them off, but, in the process, his plane's rudder jammed, forcing him to abort the mission and turn over command. Still, he managed to return to the Japanese fleet and ditched near a friendly oiler. Nevertheless, the first wave, as well as follow-up strikes, crippled the carrier Hornet and badly damaged Enterprise; however, many experienced pilots and flight leaders perished in the attack, including Murata and second wave commander Mamoru Seki. Afterwards, Lieutenant Takahashi and his dive bomber squadron were transferred to Rabaul and participated in Operation I-Go. He survived the war and later served in Japan Self-Defense Forces from 1954 to 1970.

She was one of the most prominent witnesses in the case around Marc Dutroux. Alleged Abuse Louf said that she was sexually abused by family members since age 4. Her parents are Georges and Christiane Louf. Her grandmother and mother also prostituted her out. Her grandmother, Mme Poupaert, was the widow of the chief commissioner of police. She is alleged to have run two brothels during the time of the second world war. Louf claims that her parents sold her to a man, Tony Van den Bogaert, as a child. He repeatedly took her to sex parties since age 11. Her grandmother and acquaintances of the family confirmed that Regina Louf had a sexual relationship with Tony at least since age 12. She claims that many other children were also at those parties and that the orgies would be filmed for blackmailing purposes. Louf claims that the parties also included sadism, torture and murder. According to Louf, Marc Dutroux would frequent these parties and provide the girls with drugs, as well as looking after them, his reward being allowed the girls for his pleasure as well. Louf claims that she met businessmen, politicians and police and justice personnel at the parties. She named some other victims of the child sex ring, who were murdered in order to not be able to go to the authorities, namely Christine Van Hees, Katrien De Cuyper and Carine Dellaert. Police later confirmed that the girls were actually murdered. She was able to describe how they were murdered and her descriptions matched the autopsy of two corpses of the victims, as police confirmed. Police officer Rudi Hoskens said, \\"She gave us some details that made us think it's impossible to give without having been there at that place - the way the body was found at that time, and the way she described the person who was killed.\\" Louf described the place of a murder, which was a disused mushroom farm on the outskirts of Brussels. The farm was later demolished, but in 1996 Louf described to the police team its intricate details, the wallpaper, the sinks, hooks on the ceiling, a network of stairs and adjoining rooms unique to that building. Louf also described the murder of Katrien de Cuyper. She accused herself of having murdered her in a letter she wrote to the magazine Blik. She said that there she was ordered to kill Christine Van Hees. However this testimony of Louf could never be confirmed nor dismissed. Louf claims that Michel Nihoul was also a regular at the orgies. He rewarded his business partners with the girls. She also said that there were \\"regulars\\" attending the parties around the circle of Nihoul, including advocates from Brussels, a Flemish major and a former premier minister. Louf said \\"It was highly organised. Big business. Blackmail. There was a lot of money involved.\\" Involvement in the Dutroux case Louf was one of ten victims that came forward when a Belgian judge, Jean-Marc Connerotte, filed an appeal in the Dutroux case and called for further victims to come forward. She was given the code name \\"witness X1\\". An officer in the Dutroux case, Patriek De Baets, fully believed Louf as she had detailed knowledge about two murders surrounding the case. The officers in the case were working from Neufch√¢teau. The judge, who had filed for appeal, Connerotte was dismissed from the case because he attended a fundraising dinner for the families of the victims of Dutroux. The original police officers who interviewed Louf at first were replaced. They had planned on conducting a nationwide operation to investigate all claims of Regina Louf including searching private properties and interrogation of the named persons. The proceeding judge, Jean-Claude Van Espen, disgarded the testimony of X1 and stopped the operation. Louf was eventually not called in to testify. The new residing judge, Anne Thily, declared that she was a fantasist. Public outcry The testimony of Regina Louf on public television and the disgarding of judge Jean-Marc Connerotte from the case because he attended a fund raising dinner for the victims families lead to a \\"White march\\" being organised in Brussels. 300,000-400,000 Belgian citizens took part in the march and demanded justice for the victims in the Dutroux case and an end to the corruption in the justice system. Psychological examination According to the psychologist Paul Igodt who led a council of five psychiatrists to assess Louf on the order of the judiciary, she suffers from dissociative identity disorder caused by severe and prolonged sexual abuse she suffered in her childhood. This does however not make her testimony less credible and is a common long- term health consequence of severe early childhood abuse. Private life Louf lives in Ghent with her husband and four children. She is the owner of a dog kennel and animal shelter. Publications * Silence, on tue des enfants !

He is known for his research in algorithmic number theory, algebra, post- quantum cryptography and IT security. In 1993, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize together with Claus-Peter Schnorr for his work in algorithmic number theory and cryptography. Buchmann also developed the stateful hash-based signature scheme XMSS, the first future-proof secure and practical signature scheme with minimal security requirements, which was declared the first international standard for post-quantum signature schemes in 2018. In addition, he further developed IT security research in Germany. His efforts led to the creation of ATHENE, the largest research center for IT security in Europe. For this he received the Konrad-Zuse-Medal for Services to Computer Science of the Gesellschaft f√ºr Informatik (GI) in 2017.  Life  Johannes Buchmann studied mathematics, physics, pedagogy and philosophy at the University of Cologne from 1974 to 1979 after graduating from high school in 1972 and completing his military service. After passing the first state examination for teaching at grammar schools in 1979, he taught mathematics at a Cologne secondary school from 1980 to 1983 while at the same time working as a research assistant at the university. In 1982 he did his doctorate at the university under the supervision of Hans-Joachim Stender. In 1984 he passed the second state examination. In 1985/86 he was with Hans Zassenhaus at Ohio State University on a scholarship from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. From 1986 to 1988 he was research assistant of Michael Pohst at the University of D√ºsseldorf, where he habilitated in 1988. Then he worked as professor of computer science at Saarland University. In 1996, he then was professor of computer science and mathematics at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. He retired in 2019. From 2001 to 2007, he was vice president for research at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. Since 2004 he has been chairman of the board of the Competence Center for Applied Security (CAST), the largest network for cyber security in German-speaking countries. From 2011 to 2013, Buchmann headed the project Internet Privacy - A Culture of Privacy and Trust on the Internet of the German Academy of Science and Engineering. From 2008 to 2011 he served as founding director of the Center for Advanced Security Research Darmstadt (CASED). From 2011 to 2016, he was a member of the board of directors of the European Center for Security and Privacy by Design (EC SPRIDE). From 2016 to 2018, Buchmann was vice director of the Center for Research in Security and Privacy (CRISP), the largest research institute for IT security in Europe. From 2014 to 2019 he was spokesman of the Collaborative Research Center CROSSING and from 2015 to 2019 spokesman of the profile area CYSEC of TU Darmstadt. He gave his farewell lecture on October 24, 2019. From 2017 to 2018, Johannes Buchmann trained as an MBSR (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction) teacher at the Institute for Mindfulness. Since then he has been working as a certified MBSR teacher. Buchmann is married and has two sons.  Work  Buchmann's achievements include scientific essays on algorithms in algebraic number theory, the construction of new cryptographic methods and the use of cryptographic methods in practice. Due to his collaboration with K√°lm√°n Gy≈ëry he has the Erd≈ës number 2. Buchmann dealt with algorithms in algebraic number theory and their application in cryptography. In 1988, he proposed with Hugh C. Williams a cryptographic system based on the discrete logarithmic problem in the ideal class group of imaginary-square number bodies (which, according to Carl Friedrich Gauss, is related to the theory of binary-square forms), which triggered further developments in cryptography with number bodies.Buchmann, Takagi, Vollmer: Number field cryptography. Technical Report 2003 (PDF; 186 kB) Since 1996, Buchmann has been working intensively on the topic of public key infrastructures, for which he published the book Introduction to Public Key Infrastructures together with Evangelos Karatsiolis and Alexander Wiesmaier in 2013.Buchmann, Johannes & Karatsiolis, Evangelos & Wiesmaier, Alexander. (2013). Introduction to Public Key Infrastructures. 10.1007/978-3-642-40657-7.

She had an unhappy childhood, suffering from poor health and persecution by her aunt.Gaetano Cozzi, Berinzaga, Isabella Cristina, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, vol. 9 (1967). In 1579 she was accepted as a \\"spiritual daughter\\" of the Society of Jesus after an examination by Fr Morales, sent from Rome by Jesuit General Everard Mercurian for the purpose. In 1584 Achille Gagliardi was appointed her spiritual director. In this capacity, he asked her to provide sketches of her spiritual autobiography. These circulated in manuscript for some time and eventually formed the basis for the Breve compendio intorno alla perfezione cristiana (Brescia, 1611).An English translation of which was produced by Mary Percy as Abridgement of Christian Perfection (1626). In the 1590s, the relationship between Berinzaga and her confessor came under negative scrutiny, in large part due to Isabella's claim to have received divine intimations concerning the reform of the Society of Jesus as becoming too invested in education at the expense of direct evangelization. Claudio Acquaviva, attempting to reduce Gagliardi's influence, excluded him from the General Congregation of the Society held in Rome in the winter of 1593‚Äì1594, and ordered him to leave Milan. Gagliardi, however, received political support from Juan Fern√°ndez de Velasco, Spanish governor of Milan, and was able to have the order temporarily revoked. Ultimately, however, he was forced to leave Milan. Robert Bellarmine carried out a study of writings circulating in manuscript that were attributed to Berinzaga, and condemned them as \\"new and dangerous\\", based on \\"imagination or illusions\\". Gagliardi and Berinzaga were censured, and avoided being referred to the Roman Inquisition by accepting the censure. Gagliardi attributed all the offending views to Berinzaga. She died in Milan in 1624.

It was first established by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) to investigate the use of machine intelligence and smart technology on the battlefield as well as strengthen the collaboration between autonomous agents and human soldiers in combat. An initial grant of $25 million was provided by ARL in October 2017 to fund the first five years of this potential 10-year research program. The research effort is a collaboration between ARL and Carnegie Mellon University, the University of California, Berkeley, the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Massachusetts, the University of Southern California, Georgetown University, and SRI International with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) acting as the consortium lead.  Goals  The IoBT-CRA was created as part of the U.S. Army‚Äôs long-term plans to keep up with technological advances in commercial industry and better prepare for future electronic warfare against more technologically sophisticated adversaries. In light of this objective, the IoBT-CRA focuses on exploring the capabilities of intelligent battlefield systems and large-scale heterogeneous sensor networks that dynamically evolve in real-time in order to adapt to Army mission needs. Part of the CRA research is dedicated to enhancing modern intelligent sensor and actuator capacity, allowing them to be compatible with secure military-owned networks, less trustworthy civilian networks, and adversarial networks. ARL identified six areas of research that the IoBT-CRA should strive to develop as part of its program: * Agile Synthesis: Theoretical models and methods of autonomic complex systems that provide the capacity to enable fast and effective command over military, adversary, and civilian networks. * Reflexes: Theoretical models and methods for structuring dynamic IoBTs that perform adaptive, autonomic, and self-aware behavior at varying ranges of scale, distribution, resource constraints, and heterogeneity. * Intelligent Battlefield Services: Scientific theories that will help improve the fundamental run-time capabilities of IoBTs with tasks such as information collection, predictive processing, and data anomaly detection. * Security: Methods of increasing the defenses of IoBTs such that the system is resilient to attacks and tampering from adversaries and is able to continue operating under less-than-ideal situations. * Dependability: Fundamental models related to asset composition, system adaptation, and intelligent services that are all aimed to increase the reliability of IoBTs in largely uncertain environments. * Experimentation: The architectural foundations for the IoBT seek to evaluate how well theories, algorithms, and technologies perform under various military-related scenarios for the purpose of addressing issues regarding scale, composability, and compatibility.

The death of Chow Tsz-lok in Sheung Tak, Tseung Kwan O had led to more protests. In mid November, there were city-wide strikes which lasted for more than a week. Hong Kong Police officers fired tear gas in CUHK, PolyU, and nearby areas. In late November, the District Council elections were held. The pro-democracy camp in conjunction with the localist groups got more than 80 per cent of the seats and gained control of 17 out of 18 District Councils. Events = 1 November = More than 100 people staged a flash mob protest in Central despite being confronted by police officers who warned the group they risked being prosecuted. They carried a huge yellow banner calling for an end to \\"police brutality\\", as they occupied one side of the road. =2 November= Protests took place in Causeway Bay, Wan Chai, Central and Tsim Sha Tsui on 2 November, each of which is described below: Causeway Bay election rally 128 pro-democracy candidates organised election rallies on the central lawn of Victoria Park, although the police had earlier banned rallies at that location. The candidates argued that, according to Chapter 9.11 of the Guidelines on Election-related Activities in respect of the District Council Election, the police would not need to be informed if pre- election meetings consisted of fewer than 50 supporters. In the early afternoon, thousands of people entered Victoria Park. At 3:15 pm, the police declared that the people were participating in an illegal assembly and warned them to leave immediately. Most of the people ignored the police warning, and continued to walk to Victoria Park. Subsequently, some protesters built road blocks nearby. In response, the police fired multiple rounds of tear gas into the Park. Tear gas was also fired outside Hong Kong Central Library and Sogo Hong Kong. After that, protesters left Causeway Bay for Tin Hau and Wan Chai. Police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse the crowd in Wan Chai. Some protesters set up road blocks in Wan Chai and vandalised the Queen's Road East branch of state-run Xinhua News Agency. Central rally Two rallies, to which the police did not object, took place in the afternoon at Edinburgh Place and Chater Garden in Central. Soon after both rallies had begun, the police ordered the organisers to end the rallies immediately at 5:10 pm and to ask all participants to leave by 5:30 pm. By evening violence in Causeway Bay had spread to Central: Protesters threw Molotov cocktails on Lung Wo Road, and set up barricades on Connaught Road Central, blocking traffic; Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters. A Yoshinoya branch was trashed, and Central MTR station was closed after protesters vandalised several exits. An argument started between a firefighter and police when the former accused police of hitting his firetruck with a tear gas projectile. Amidst the tension, the police pushed the firefighter, then pepper sprayed journalists filming the scene and pushed them away. A first-aider suffered severe back burns after reportedly being hit by a tear gas canister. Tsim Sha Tsui rally A rally at 4 pm in Park Lane Shopper's Boulevard, attended by a hundred participants sang protest songs. Some protesters shouted slogans and wore face masks. A large squad of riot police arrived at the rally from Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station. They threatened to arrest those on face masks and disperse the crowds. After quarrels with protesters, the police stood down and returned to the police station.

One took place around Cityplaza, a mall in the eastern part of Hong Kong Island, early in the evening. Entrances of two restaurants were spray painted. Outside Cityplaza, a Mandarin-speaking man slashed several people with a knife. The police stormed into the plaza. Outside the mall, Andrew Chiu, a Democratic Party district councillor representing Tai Koo Shing West, had his left ear bitten off by the man. A crowd then punched and kicked the man in retaliation. Joey Kwok, a freelance photojournalist working for Stand News, and Tang Chak-man, a journalism student at Hong Kong Baptist University and a member of its Students' Union Editorial Board, were both arrested while reporting at the scene. Stand News described the arrest as unreasonable, saying in a statement that Kwok was wearing a press vest, filming the police from a distance when he was surrounded and subdued by riot officers. Roland Chin, the head of Baptist University, said he was \\"deeply concerned\\" with the well-being of Tang, noting that university staff and a lawyer had been sent to assist the student. Due to doxxing, private details of a police officer's wedding in Tseung Kwan O were leaked. Protesters intending to crash the event set up road blocks and threw objects at the police. Then, the police attempted to disperse the crowd by firing tear gas rounds. Chow Tsz-lok, a 22-year-old student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, was later found unconscious on the second floor of Sheung Tak Estate's car park, suspected to have fallen from the third floor in the early hours of 4 November. Chow died on 8 November, after two unsuccessful brain surgeries. =4 November= Six reporters staged a silent protest at a routine police press conference. They each wore a safety helmet with one Chinese character, which, when combined, read \\"investigate police violence, stop police lies\\" (). The police stopped its online live stream two minutes later and cancelled the entire press conference 20 minutes later. Bon Ko, Police Public Relations Branch superintendent, suspended the conference as the reporters refused to either take off their helmets or leave the venue. Later that day, the police staged a live broadcast on Facebook to express their views on the protests over the weekend. Five defendants, aged between 19 and 24, were charged with possessing explosive substances after Molotov cocktails were found in a flat in Wan Chai. Three attended the hearing at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts while two remained hospitalised. Charges had to be dropped due to a spelling error by the Department of Justice. Upon the release of the trio, they were immediately re-arrested by a dozen officers in riot gear who had entered the court building, while more than 100 police officers were waiiting outside the premises. The defence counsel argued that the arrests inside court premises without the magistrate's approval constituted contempt of court. The judiciary responded that the ground floor was a public area and not under its management. =5 November Tsim Sha Tsui rally= Over a thousand people in Guy Fawkes masks gathered at 8 pm at the Urban Council Centenary Garden, Tsim Sha Tsui. The event was to mark the one month anniversary of the introduction of the Hong Kong's anti-mask law. The exact venue of the gathering was only announced thirty minutes before the start. The purpose was to minimise time for police preparation. The crowd occupied roads around the garden, with Hunghom Caf√©, a restaurant seen as pro- government, and a few shops vandalised. At 9 pm, the police deployed a water cannon truck to the area, firing tear liquid at the crowd, some of which were reporters. Crowds gathered near Kwong Ming Court and Sheung Tak Estate in Tseung Kwan O late at night to protest. The stated purpose was to express dissatisfaction over the severe injuries suffered by a 22-year-old university student two days before, who at that time remained in critical condition. Police fired tear gas at protesters in response to the blockade of roads started by protesters. =8 November= Protesters laid flowers for Chow Tsz- lok Chow Tsz-lok died at 8:09 am at the age of 22, after succumbing to a cardiac arrest, as a result of fall injuries sustained on 4 November. The police were criticised for intentionally obstructing the paramedics from attending to him, causing a delay in treatment, as it took the ambulance 19 minutes to reach Chow, seven minutes longer than their service pledge of 12 minutes; however, the police denied intentionally obstructing paramedics. Leung Kwok-lai, the Fire Services Department Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer (Kowloon East) stated that the ambulance assigned to Chow was blocked by buses and private vehicles but that the ambulance did not come in contact with the police that were on duty. Angered and saddened by the news, students from HKUST vandalised several stores perceived to be pro-Beijing and the residence of HKUST president Wei Shyy, demanding him to condemn police brutality. Shyy later released an open letter demanding the government to conduct \\"thorough and independent investigation\\" regarding Chow's death. Flash mob rallies mourning the death of Chow were held in various districts including Kwun Tong and Central during lunch hours. At night, thousands of mourners returned to the car park of Sheung Tak Estate and laid down flowers and origami for the deceased student. Meanwhile, protesters began clashing with the police in Causeway Bay and Mong Kok. At the junction of Hamilton Street and Nathan Road in Yau Ma Tei, the police fired a warning shot to the sky. =9 November vigil= Protesters at night (9 December) Thousands of people gathered in Tamar Park at night to mourn the deaths of \\"martyrs\\", people who died for the protests. During the rally, protesters prayed for the deceased, and shouted slogans urging Hong Kong people to take revenge. The organiser claimed that 100,000 people attended the vigil, while the police put the figure at 7,500. =10 November= Protesters gathered in various shopping malls in Hong Kong including New Town Plaza in Sha Tin, and Festival Walk in Kowloon Tong, responding online calls to \\"shop\\" in these malls. Conflicts first erupted in Sha Tin when protesters vandalised the Sha Tin station and trashed a Maxim restaurant. Inside Festival Walk, protesters vandalised the branch of SimplyLife (which was under Maxim's operation). The police then stormed the mall and beat the protesters with police batons and pepper-sprayed them. The police also indiscriminately pushed and beat people who were retreating down an elevator, and shot pepper balls at people who have verbally insulted them. Journalists and shoppers were then forced to leave the mall. The police and protesters also clashed with each other in Tsuen Wan, as the Tsuen Wan riot police officers faced allegations that they have gang raped a young girl. During the confrontation between the police and the protester, the police shot a tear gas canister at the arm of a reporter from Now TV. The protesters then retreated to Citywalk in Tsuen Wan. Scuffles between the police and the protesters also occurred in Tuen Mun, Mong Kok, Tai Po, and Tseung Kwan O, near the car park where Chow fell. The Northern District saw the first usage of tear gas by the police after residents disgruntled by the police's search on teenagers who were playing basketball attempted to argue with officers near Ching Ho Estate, Sheung Shui. Riot police climbed over a 3-meter gate of Kingswood Villas, Tin Shui Wai, and conducted arrests inside. Disgruntled residents later then confronted with the police. =11‚Äì15 November city-wide strike= Protesters disrupted the morning commute on 11 November as part of a plan for a city-wide strike, calling for students, business owners and employees to skip work and boycott classes, as a response to HKUST student Alex Chow's mysterious fall to his death in a multi-storey car park. The protesters continued the strike over the following five days. Carrie Lam labelled the protesters as the enemy of the people and criticised the violence used by the protesters, which have \\"exceeded\\" their demands for democracy. On the next day, she praised the citizens who insisted on going to work or to school despite the protests. Chinese leader Xi Jinping, speaking at a Brazil summit, voiced his support for the police, and added that \\"persistent radical and violent crimes\\" had undermined the rule of law in Hong Kong. Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen criticised the Hong Kong government on Facebook, stating they should not shoot unarmed people, while Beijing and Hong Kong government should respond by the promise of democracy and freedom instead of bullets. She later called on the international community to stand with Hong Kong after the police confronted the protesters at CUHK. The United States expressed \\"grave concerns\\" for the situation in Hong Kong and urged both sides to \\"exercise restraints\\". It urged the Beijing government to honour the Sino- British Joint Declaration and the Hong Kong government and the protesters to engage in dialogue to resolve the conflict. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson released a statement urging both sides to exercise restraint and stating that the UK government was deeply disturbed by the events. Like the US, he urged both camps to engage in dialogue. 11 November ‚Äì Dawn Action The first day of the city-wide strike was named Dawn Action (). Protesters began to gather at 6:30 am and then began disrupting both MTR operations and surface transports starting from 7 am. Objects were thrown onto the train tracks of the East Rail Line, and later, molotov bottles were thrown onto a Central- bound train in Kwai Fong Station. Tung Chung station was the first stations closed by the MTR Corporation, citing an \\"escalation\\" of events. MTR then shut down Whampoa station at 8:18 am, and Kwai Fong Station at 8:53 am. Kwun Tong Line, Tung Chung Line, East Rail Line, Ma On Shan Line and Light rail services were all disrupted. Protesters also made makeshift roadblocks in major thoroughfares in Kowloon and New Territories, including in districts such as Sha Tin, near the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Yuen Long, Hung Hom and Tsuen Wan. In Kwai Fong, protesters set up a roadblock near the Metroplaza mall. A police officer riding a motorcycle charged into a crowd of demonstrators and zig-zagged across the road in an attempt to hit the protesters. The officer appeared not to hit any protesters straight on, but came very close to slamming straight into one. The police motorcycle was accused of deliberately ramming into the protesters, while the police claimed that he was trying to \\"separate\\" the protesters and the police and that the officer in question has been forced to take a sabbatical from work. The video quickly went viral in the Internet, and pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong responded to the incident and stated that the police officer had gone 'berserk' and his behaviour was 'disturbing'. Later that day in Ma On Shan, a protester poured flammable liquid onto a man and lit him on fire during an argument between the man and the protesters. The incident happened as the 57-year-old man confronted the group of protesters who were vandalising Ma On Shan station. The man was afterwards transported to the Prince of Wales Hospital at Sha Tin in critical condition, with head trauma and severe burns. A spokeswoman for the Fire Services Department said that the victim had second-degree burns on 28 per cent of his body. The police classified the incident as an attempted murder case. In response to the incident, the Chief Executive Carrie Lam said that the fire attack was an inhumane act. Amidst online calls to facilitate a general strike, protesters near Hong Kong Polytechnic University constructed makeshift roadblocks and barricades with various furniture outside the school campus. The riot police then entered the university and shot tear gas canisters inside the school campus. Student protesters, in return, set up barricades and threw petrol bombs. Similar incidents also happened in University of Hong Kong and Chinese University of Hong Kong where the police shot tear gas into the campuses and student protesters confronted with the police for several hours. The major universities in Hong Kong and institutions organised by the Vocational Training Council have suspended their classes on that day. The police shot numerous canisters of tear gas to disperse the protesters in regions including Choi Hung and Tseung Kwan O, where a tear gas canister landed next to a secondary school. In response to the shooting, office workers in Central, Hong Kong's central business district, marched on Pedder Street and briefly occupied Des Voeux Road Central and shouted out slogans, condemning the police as \\"murderers\\" during the lunchtime in a \\"Lunch with You\\" march. Riot police were deployed at 12:30 pm to warn the crowd that they would use force to disperse the protesters. At 12:47 pm. the police shot fire tear gas to disperse the crowd. A man's head was hit by a tear gas canister. The Hang Seng Index dropped 2.6% after tear gas was fired in Central. The police reported that protesters have set up roadblocks in more than 120 locations in Hong Kong, and have arrested 266 people, whose age ranges from 11 to 74 years old. At least 60 people were injured. 255 canisters of tear gas, 204 shots of rubber bullets, 45 shots of beanbag rounds and 96 shots of sponge grenades were used by the police. =Shooting incident= Before 7:30 am on Monday 11 November 2019, a group of protesters had gathered in Sai Wan Ho at the intersection of Shau Kei Wan Road and Tai On Street. While they were trying to block the road, policemen arrived and tried to disperse the crowd. A masked young man wearing a white hoodie is said to have shouted at a traffic policeman. The man raised his hands once to show that he held no weapons. The traffic policeman pointed a gun at the man's chest and quickly locked him in a choke hold while still holding the gun, pointing it at pedestrians. One unarmed 21-year-old man in black was shot once in the abdomen and fell on the zebra crossing between MTR Exit B and Tai On Building. A third young man, dressed in black, approached and was also shot, once or twice. In total, the traffic policeman fired three live rounds. A man in black fell onto the ground, while another man in black was shot twice when approaching the first wounded man. The man in white escaped right after the shots were fired. Another policeman arrived in the scene and control the shot young man-in- black. The police officer who opened fire continue to alert with the gun, while another police officer used his baton to warn the bystanders and protesters. After that, some riot police arrived and shot pepper spray at bystanders, which included many elderly. They also arrested two people. After the man was shot and lost his consciousness, a police officer pulled him up to sit, in an attempt to handcuff him and shook his body, exacerbating the bleeding from his abdomen and dangerously reducing blood supply to his brain. Police later defended the officer who had moved the unconscious injured man, stating that the officer had been \\"unaware of the injury\\" and that security concerns had played a role. The men were sent to the hospital. In 9:15 am, Hong Kong Hospital Authority (HA) revealed that one of the men was undergoing surgery in Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital. The abdomen of that man was shot, which resulted in damage to the right kidney and right-side liver with injury to the portal vein. The man remained in a critical condition after surgery which removed a bullet, his right kidney, and part of the liver. The Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education (IVE) issued a declaration confirming the man as a student of their Chai Wan campus. In a statement, the Vocational Training Council, the IVE's parent organisation, said they were distressed and sad over the man's injury, and had written to the Security Bureau asking for a complete investigation of the incident. Salesian English School, the injured protester's alma mater, issued a statement condemning the police's use of excessive violence and fatal weapons, arguing that they chased citizens away indiscriminately and were indifferent to life. They expressed serious concern and urged the government to set up an independent commission of inquiry. They also highlighted their distress and urged youngsters to express their demands peacefully, protecting themselves and others. In its press conference, the police confirmed that a traffic officer fired three live rounds; they claimed that one of the officers attempted to fire warning shots in response to protesters trying to grab the officer's gun, with one shot hitting one of the protesters at the scene. Amnesty International condemned the police's operations on 11 November. It called for the police officer who shot the teens at a point blank range to be suspended from duty immediately and called the officer who rammed into the crowd of protesters \\"out of control with a mindset of retaliation\\". By the evening of 11 November 2019, the shooting incident had caused an outcry at Good Hope School, the school of the traffic officer's two daughters. He resigned from the PTA the same day. He was doxed and received death threats against his daughters soon after the shooting. 12 November ‚Äì Daybreak Action Protesters at CUHK Protests continued on 12 November, and it was named Daybreak Action (). In Central, a few thousand people, including office workers and protesters dressed in black, occupied streets at midday; tear gas was fired in the afternoon to clear out the remaining crowd. Some universities and schools closed, but the government ruled out an official suspension of classes to avoid being seen as submitting to protesters. The police also confronted with the protesters outside City University of Hong Kong, who threw objects from the footbridge in an attempt to block the traffic in Kowloon Tong. The police and the protesters also clashed briefly at the University of Hong Kong. In HKU, protesters blocked the entrance of the HKU station. Several professors, including the Dean of the Science Faculty, attempted to persuade the students to stop the blockade, though most black-clad protesters ignored them. For the entire day, the police clashed with the protesters in Chinese University of Hong Kong. At night, protesters marched into the Festival Walk mall in Kowloon Tong after the mall closed early and set a giant Christmas tree on fire; some glass guard rails and doors were also smashed. A China Mobile shop was set on fire in Causeway Bay. In Sheung Shui, a train was firebombed and objects were thrown onto the train track. In Mong Kok, police fired multiple tear gas rounds as protesters blocked roads and vandalised public infrastructure, such as traffic lights and switch boxes. In Tin Shui Wai, protesters besieged and started a fire inside the police station. In Sha Tin, a police van was set on fire. Government published figures indicated that the police fired a record 2,330 canisters of tear gas that day all over Hong Kong, in particular at the Chinese University ‚Äì the highest number in a single day since the protests began in June. 13 November ‚Äì Dagian Action The third day of the strikes was named Dagian Action (). People obstructed train services at multiple stations. At one point in the morning, the MTR suspended services on the Tsuen Wan, East Rail and Kwun Tong lines entirely, though partial service on the Kwun Tong line resumed later. A section of the West Rail line was also closed, along with a few other individual stations in the MTR network and parts of the Light Rail. The Tolo Highway, which connects parts of the New Territories to Kowloon and Hong Kong Island, was shut down. The Transport Department reported that many bus routes were out of operation due to road conditions, with only 108 routes still running by 11 am. Oxfam announced it was cancelling its annual Trailwalker charity event, due to take place the coming weekend, due to an inability to guarantee the safety of participants. The Educational Bureau announced that all schools would be suspended on 14 November, after criticism following Carrie Lam's statement the previous day which suggested that suspending classes would cause the government to fall into the \\"protesters' trap\\". More than 100 schools already suspended classes individually that day, while at least ten higher educational institutions suspended classes for the rest of the week. The Bureau was criticised for the delay in class suspension, with school management staff calling for an extension of the school closure until the end of the week. Both the Hong Kong Association of the Heads of Secondary Schools and the Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union noted the Bureau's failure to protect the safety of students in their late decision to suspend classes. Lunchtime protests occurred in Central again. Protesters blocked the junction of Des Voeux Road Central and Pedder Street with bricks and bamboo poles; riot police responded by firing tear gas. A person with his head bleeding was tied up and flipped over by riot police; he remained conscious, while nearby protesters chanted for his release. At night, protesters set the toll gates of the Cross Harbour Tunnel on fire. Protesters clashed with the police in Sha Tin, and one tear gas canister was shot into a fifth-floor apartment in Chuk Lam Court. Flower troughs outside the Shatin Law Courts Building was also set on fire; the next day, both the Hong Kong Bar Association and the Law Society of Hong Kong condemned the arson as an attack on the city's rule of law. A man died after allegedly falling from a tall building in Tsuen Wan. A 15-year-old boy, who was suspected to be stricken by a tear gas canister in Tin Shui Wai, remained in a critical condition after undergoing four hours of brain surgery at Tuen Mun Hospital overnight.

The confrontation between the two groups occurred when the latter group tried to clear bricks from the street and were confronted by over 20 black-clad protesters who began throwing objects at the group. A 70-year-old man, Luo Changqing, who was using his mobile phone to record the conflict in the area of the fighting, was hit in the head by a brick thrown by a protester. The victim fell to the ground immediately and remained in an unconscious state. He was first transported to the North District Hospital and then to the Prince of Wales Hospital in a critical and life-threatening condition, before dying there at 10:51 pm on the following day. The man was identified as an outsourced worker of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department. At a regular briefing, the police stated that they have identified several suspects and that investigations were ongoing. They classified his death as a murder, believing the attacker to have \\"maliciously [and] deliberately\\" carried out the act. The Prince of Wales hospital said it would transfer the case to the Coroner's Court for investigation, while the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department expressed \\"profound sadness\\" over the death. On 14 December, the Hong Kong Police released a statement stating they had arrested three males and two females aged 15 to 18 the previous day on suspicion of his murder, as well as rioting and wounding. 14 November ‚Äì Twilight Action The fourth day of the city-wide strike was named Twilight Action (). Early in the morning, police fired tear gas into the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) campus in Hung Hom. One arrow was suspected to be shot from the university towards a group of police officers patrolling nearby, though no police officer was injured. In a press conference, police condemned the action, saying that the shot could have been lethal. The Education Bureau announced that schools would suspend classes from Friday to Sunday. At lunchtime, hundreds of people protested on the streets in Central like the previous three days, while a few hundred also rallied on the streets in Taikoo Place in eastern Hong Kong Island. At noon in Sheung Shui, a group of around twenty middle-aged men used steel tubes to attack two young women who were setting up road blocks. The two women were unable to escape and were grabbed at the same time by a large man wearing a white shirt and jeans. One of the women was able to escape but the other was grabbed and dragged away quickly; she only escaped by taking off her jacket and backpack. She said she was not going to report the incident to police for fear of retribution from police, being concerned that she may instead be treated as a perpetrator. The group of men also attacked other young people dressed in black at the same time. In an interview, the two women expressed their frustration at people fleeing the scene instead of going back to help them escape. At night, around a thousand people gathered at Edinburgh Place to express support towards firefighters and paramedics in Hong Kong for their work during the protests. Participants contrasted their work with that of the police, praising firefighter and ambulance teams for treating people equally and helped injured people regardless of their political views. The rally was authorised by police and no incidents occurred.

Thousands of people, mainly office workers, protested on the streets in Central, chanting the slogan \\"Stand with Hong Kong\\" and raising an open hand, with the five fingers referencing the \\"five demands\\" associated with the protests. The CBD protests spread to more areas including Tai Koo Shing and Wong Chuk Hang. Two German exchange students at Lingnan University were arrested for unlawful assembly. At night, a car was set on fire at CUHK. Magnetic Asia, the organisers of Clockenflap, an annual music and arts festival in Hong Kong, announced the cancellation of the 2019 event, originally set to take place the following week. Hundreds of runners proceeded with the original Oxfam Trailwalker course despite its official cancellation. =16 November= All lanes of the Tolo Highway reopened to traffic, and the MTR's East Rail line returned to normal service, though the University and Sheung Shui stations remained closed. Thousands of people participated in the annual Hong Kong Pride Parade. The event was held at Edinburgh Place in Central in the form of a rally instead of a march like previous years, due to the police rejecting the organiser's application for a march due to safety concerns. Organisers estimated a turnout of 6,500 people, halved from previous years, while police estimated 850. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers have appeared publicly for the first time in the streets, in plain clothes and unarmed, to help clear roadblocks and other debris left during protests alongside local residents, firefighters, and police officers before marching back to the Kowloon East barracks around 5 pm. That night, the government confirmed that it had not requested any assistance from the PLA. The move was slammed by both the pro-democracy camp and by protesters. In a joint statement, 24 pro-democracy lawmakers condemned the PLA garrison for allegedly breaching the Hong Kong Basic Law and the Garrison Law, which state that the garrison \\"shall not interfere in local affairs\\" and must notify the Hong Kong government before conducting activities involving public interests. Civic Party lawmaker Dennis Kwok said he filed an urgent question at LegCo. The Citizens' Press Conference, a platform for protesters, described the incident as illustrating the \\"boiling frog syndrome\\" and setting a precedent to \\"violently suppress\\" Hongkongers in the future. =17 November= Clashes occurred at the Polytechnic University. Protesters set fire to debris on a footbridge connecting the university campus to MTR Hung Hom station, and used catapults to launch objects at police. Police used a Long Range Acoustic Device to \\"issue warnings\\" at protesters, and deployed two water cannon trucks; the top of one of the trucks was set alight by protesters who threw petrol bombs at them. One police officer was hit in the leg with an arrow, piercing through his calf. At midnight, police warned that live rounds may be used at protesters because police officers were targeted. Police locked down the PolyU campus at night by surrounding the main entrances to the university, and thoroughly searched everyone, including journalists, who wanted to leave. The police force issued a warning that anyone remaining on campus may be treated as taking part in a riot, ordering people to leave from an exit by the university's Lee Shau Kee Building. Protesters called upon supporters to \\"rescue\\" those who remained at PolyU and were unable to leave; cars headed to the area early Monday morning.

Police entered the PolyU campus at 5:30 am. A number of protesters were quickly arrested; some protesters threw Molotov cocktails at the police officers, while some police officers were seen kicking people on the ground. In a statement, the police denied \\"raiding\\" the campus, stating instead that they were conducting an operation on Cheung Wan Road. In a press conference, PolyU student representative Owan Li said police prevented anyone from leaving the university, while Student Union President Derek Liu criticised the police for using \\"unequal force\\" and \\"weapons\\" to prevent anyone from escaping, saying that the union did not want a Tiananmen Square-like crackdown in Hong Kong. At around 9:30 am, at least 40 people were detained outside Hotel Icon, PolyU's teaching hotel. Student Union vice- president Ken Woo told RTHK that in the morning, at least 500 people remained on campus, while 70 to 100 people attempted to leave but were dispersed by tear gas and had to retreat back to the campus. At 11 am, the Hong Kong Police Force shot tear gas towards Queen Elizabeth Hospital, forcing the hospital to suspend specialist services and to use plastic tape to seal its windows and doors. In Central, lunchtime protests continued, with many showing support for students at PolyU. The Court of First Instance ruled that the Emergency Regulations Ordinance was partly unconstitutional in encroaching on the Legislative Council's power to make laws, while the government's anti-mask law was unconstitutional in that it \\"goes further than necessary\\" in restricting fundamental rights. In response, the police announced that they would suspend enforcing the anti-mask law. The ruling was condemned by mainland Chinese authorities, which said it alone had authority to rule on constitutional matters in Hong Kong. An estimated 100 secondary school students remained at PolyU in the afternoon. Some of their parents organised a sit-in near the university urging police to allow their children to leave, and about 20 school principals asked the government to allow them to enter the campus to meet their students inside and bring them out. At night, some injured people left the campus with the help of paramedics, though they had to provide their personal information to police before leaving. Another group of protesters escaped the campus by climbing down ropes from a footbridge. These protesters were then driven away with motorbikes on a road below. Thousands of people gathered on main roads in Kowloon at night, in solidarity with those who remained trapped at PolyU. Protesters threw petrol bombs, while police officers responded with tear gas rounds and water cannon. Footage showed the police allegedly driving a van at high speed into protesters on Nathan Road during their clearance operation. Police arrested 51 people who \\"claimed to be medics or journalists\\" at the university, saying that twelve of the purported medics did not have first aid qualifications; the police added that anyone walking out of the university campus would be charged with rioting. After midnight, more than 100 people left the PolyU campus, after a delegation of secondary school principals negotiated with police to allow minors to leave the campus and return home. Those under 16 were released after having their identities taken, though police reserved the right to prosecute them in the future; whereas, those who were 16 or above were arrested immediately. =19 November= Protesters still outside PolyU A number of protesters who remained at PolyU attempted to exit the campus through underground sewers. Some of them fell ill and were treated by medics. Divers under the Fire Services Department searched the pipes, but failed to find anyone after two hours of searching. =20 November= Primary and secondary school resumed classes. Protesters disrupted MTR train services in the morning, with the Kwun Tong, Island, Tsuen Wan, East and West Rail lines experiencing delays of ten to fifteen minutes. Protesters disrupted the Island line by opening the emergency doors on trains. = 21 November = Hundreds attended a sit-in at the Yoho Mall in Yuen Long at night, marking four months since the 2019 Yuen Long attack. Other sit-ins were held at MTR stations across Hong Kong. At Heng Fa Chuen, protesters folded origami cranes and told passersby to vote in the district elections. The MTR closed Yuen Long station at 2 pm that day, much earlier than usual and ahead of the planned protest at Yoho Mall. Police arrested at least six people after their dispersal operation in Yuen Long. Organisers announced it was cancelling singer Eason Chan's series of Fear and Dreams concerts, Chan's first concerts held at the Hong Kong Coliseum in six years, due to concerns with public safety. The concerts were originally scheduled over the end of 2019. = 22 November = Six protesters left PolyU, holding hands, while some others continued to stay in PolyU, saying they have no plans to surrender. = 24 November = The Hong Kong local elections, which were heavily influenced by the protests, took place. The elections were widely described as a proxy referendum over the protest movement's demands. The elections had a record turnout of over 71 per cent and resulted in a landslide victory for the pro- democracy camp, with them taking control of 17 of the 18 district councils and tripling their seats from about 124 to around 388. = 25 November = Hundreds of protesters gathered near PolyU trying to get in, but they were blocked by riot police. = 26 November = Protesters in the MegaBox Mall (26 November) Office workers in Central protested, with the rallies spreading over to Kowloon Bay. Workers in office attire, along with other protesters took over some roads near the MegaBox Mall in Kowloon Bay as they shouted slogans accusing police of brutality, as well as in support of the people who've been holed up in Polytechnic University. They chanted slogans such as \\"five demands, not one less\\" and \\"save the students, enter PolyU\\" as they occupied roads and disrupted traffic. =28 November= In response to the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act being passed by the United States Congress one week prior and signed by President Donald Trump earlier that day, a rally was held at Edinburgh Place to celebrate the Act's enactment. Many participants waved American flags and shouted various slogans. According to the organisers, 100,000 people took part in the rally.

Protesters made makeshift barricades at Prince Edward in the middle of roads. Hundreds of young and old protesters filled Chater Garden in support of the protests. Hundreds of people gathered in Wong Tai Sin to celebrate the results of the election. A civilian was hit in the head with a drain cover while removing the makeshift barricades in Prince Edward after midnight, 1 December. While it sparked a manhunt, no arrest was made.

It was designed by Nugent Cachemaille-Day and built in 1938‚Äì39. History With the expansion of the hamlet of Preston into a suburb of Paignton during the late 19th-century and early 20th-century, a mission room was first established around 1904. A temporary church dedicated to St Paul was then erected in 1909 as a chapel of ease to Christ Church, with accommodation for 200 persons. As additional church accommodation was soon required, a second temporary church was erected adjacent to the other in 1912, with accommodation for 350 people. By 1937, the parish of Christ Church had a population of over 8,000, which was forecast to increase in the following years. With support from the Christ Church Parochial Church Council and the Bishop of Exeter, Rev. A. Harrington, the vicar of Christ Church, launched an appeal to raise ¬£10,000 for a new, permanent church to be built. ¬£4,600 had already been raised over previous years towards such a building. In October 1937, Nugent Cachemaille-Day was hired to design a church capable of accommodating up to 450 persons. Messrs. Wippell of Exeter were later hired as the builders and construction began on 31 October 1938. The original intention was to build the nave, chancel and lower part of the tower, omitting the upper part of the tower and a chapel until more funds were raised. By the time construction began, a sum of ¬£8,214 had been achieved and a loan of ¬£2,000 received. The foundation stone was laid by Dame Violet Wills of Haytor, in the presence of the Bishop of Exeter, on 14 January 1939. In May 1939, the Parochial Church Council unanimously decided to complete the entire church under their contract with Messrs. Wippell. Funds continued to be raised and a revised plan for the tower was submitted by Cachemaille-Day in June 1939. The completed church, which cost ¬£12,500 to build, was consecrated by the Bishop of Exeter, the Right Rev. Charles Curzon, on 9 December 1939. St Paul's was later made its own parish in 1948. A church hall was built adjacent to St Paul's in 1969. In 2002, St Paul's and Christ Church were united as a joint benefice.

The region was heavily pested during the Cretan War (1645‚Äì1669) with pirates who both raided ships in Herceg Novi and in Shkod√´r. During the Ottoman rule (1571‚Äì1880) the fleet of Ulcinj became the main pillar of the Ottoman Empire with Albanian sailors barely recognizing the Ottoman authorities. In 1710 the fleet grew in 250‚Äì300 ships with a crew of 4000‚Äì5000. In 1710, the Venetian consul in Durr√´s and Boka hoped that in the chaos that ensued the flet of Ulcinj would be destroyed. From Shkod√´r, there were around 804 traders with 200 being from Ulcinj. For a long time, the traders traded with the Republic of Ragusa. In the 17th century, the east Mediterranean was dominated by French and Venetian ships, however, Dulcinian ships participated in the transit trade, with improved odds after the Russo-Turkish War (1768‚Äì1774). On November 2, 1772, the fleet was hired by the Ottomans to fight the Russian armada Konyef in the west of Peloponnese close to Patros Island in the Aegean Sea. The constant wars between the Ottomans and the Venetians severely effected the trade. Despite the military elements of the fleet, it was mostly commercial. The strong fleet made Ulcinj into a trading center. During the second half of the 18th century, the fleet expanded its trade as the demands for cotton increased in European countries. In the 18th and 19th century, there were female Albanian captains present, such as Hana Ishmi of the Flora ship, Hata Karamidija, the spouse of pirate lord Hajdar Karamidija, and Sofije Shkambi, captain of the Fortuna.  History  The first sign of a merchant fleet in Ulcinj is from 1420 when the city gave itself up to Venice out of fear from the Ottomans, according to a column in the English newspaper Chelsea Herald (1873‚Äì1909) published in 1880. Generally, Albanian merchants from Ulcinj had been formed, alongside Greeks, before 1750. In the 17th century, continuing to the 18th century, the fleet expanded. During the first 6 months of the year 1711 there were 12 different sailboats of various tonnages. Durr√´s Venetian consul, Peter Rosa, sent a letter in June 1707, to the Venetian Senate, explaining that the fleet of Ulcinj consisted of 250 sailboats of different sizes. The Venetian merchant fleet felt threatened and tried to curb the fleet of Ulcinj. In 1709, when the Venetian‚ÄìTurkish war broke out, the Venetians closed their consulate in Durr√´s thus endangering the trade for the fleets. Venetian trade authorities improved the general trade agreements by allowing Shkod√´r merchants to accompany the wares to Venice who would then load other goods on their way back, with mostly Ulcinj vessels sailing. However as rivalry increased, Venice ordered a prohibition from the Porte forbidding the ships from Ulcinj to transport cereals. In 1718, Venice initiated a protectionist policy against Albanian merchant ships. However the mariners refused to accept this and on may 6, 1720, five armed Ulcinj ships blocked the bay of Durr√´s and demanded that foreign ships leave the Albanian coast. In 1720, the Ulcinj trading fleet became the protagonist in the trade and mediation between Habsburg and Venice, dealing mostly in salted fish, liquor, cheese, turtles, silk, linseed, dried fruits, wax, soap, tallow, silk, cotton, timber, pitch, tar and, above all, cereals, tobacco and olive oil and raisins. The fleet also improved the trading relations and communication between the Adriatic and Mediterranean. In 1745, the Dulcignote vessels expanded the trade in Trieste, Ancona and Apulia reaching high trade in 1744‚Äì46 and 1746‚Äì51. The expanding fleets of Shkoder along with Dulcigno made Venice nervous. In 1750, the merchant fleet of Ulcinj traded in timber and cereal numbering around 200 ships. As the competition increased, two rival merchant fleets were soon created: A Greek with crew members from Psara, Hydra and Spetsai, and the other an Albanian with members from Ulcinj, Vlor√´ and Durr√´s, and a third fleet from Ragusa joined in. These fleets fought over the markets of ideology and the purchasing and transport of goods. In 1786, the Greek-Albanian merchant fleets consisted of 400 ships, and in 1812, of more than 600. Throughout the 1750s, the Ulcinj pirates made trading worse for the fleet but after the Bushati reforms, the pirates quickly were transformed to a large commercial maritime power thus rivaling both Venetian and Ragusan fleets. In 1779, the northern regions of Shkodra districts had to import grain from central Albania, but because of the wars between Albanian nobles, the price of grain was inflated by merchants, and the Pasha of Shkod√´r interfered by raising the prices of grain and collaborating with the merchant ships of Ulcinj, numbering 200 at the bay, with some belonging to the Bushati family. Before 1779, the trade was dominated by Venetian subjects, and Kurd Pasha tried to stop the merchant fleet of Ulcinj. However, in 1780, Mahmud Pasha lifted the ban and focused his effort on the fleet again. In 1781, the Agas of Ulcinj demanded that the ronda tax system be abolished which was granted. Kara Mahmud Pasha's tax liberation policy \\"mukataa\\" for the fleet of Ulcinj made things worse for Venice as the Albanian merchants now profited more. In 1783, Kara Mahmud Pasha traveled to Dubrovnik to see if the Franciscan friars would help him. He was, however, not greeted well, mostly due to the financial difficulty as a result of the Ulcinj trading fleet's tax liberation. The visit was recorded by Pater Balneo who prepared for the visitation. Mahmud Pasha returned home and canceled the commercial treaties with Dubrovnik. The Ulcinj traders transported wheat to Venice, Istria, Trieste and also Genoa. During the Ottoman period, the traders occasionally served as sailors for the Porte. In 1717, Venice proposed a resolution of arming ships against \\"the privateers of Ulcinj in order to allow free trade in the Adriatic sea\\". According to A. Baldacci, the fleet had 500 ships transporting mainly grain, salt, tobacco and wool. In 1818, the fleet consisted of 400 ships. In 1821, when the Austro- Hungarian war fleet began circulating in the Adriatic, the fleet of Ulcinj decreased. The French consul in Shkod√´r, Hecguard, stated that the sailors made ships weighing anything between 100 and 200 tons. In 1737, even larger ships were built but the Porte forbade the construction and halted it. In 1845, the fleet competed with Austrian trade. The demand of sardines necessary for the Catholic population of Ulcinj used in festivities was possible thanks to the fleet. Known traders amongst many others were the tartanes of Ulcinj. During the 19th century, the fleet was first mentioned in a written letter in 1854 by Hahn, the Austrian consul in Shkod√´r. During the Russo-Turkish war (1876‚Äì1878), the fleet had 400 ships. During the Montenegrin period (1880‚Äì1918), the fleet had 107 ships.

At the time of its release, the music video accompanying the release of the single was one of the most expensive ever. Lyrics and music Hartford Courant critic Dawne Simon described the music of \\"Here Comes the Hammer\\" as \\"upbeat\\" but the lyrics as \\"egotistical chants.\\" Billboard Magazine described it as a \\"James Brown-inspired funk rave, replete with rapid-fire rhyming, a rousing chant at the chorus, and infectious synth line.\\" The song samples Brown's 1970 hit \\"Super Bad.\\" Reception Billboard Magazine considered \\"Here Comes the Hammer\\" to be a \\"winner.\\" Nonetheless, although the three previous singles from the album were Top 10 hits, \\"Here Comes the Hammer\\" stalled at #54 on the Billboard Hot 100. It performed better on Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts, peaking at #15 and #17, respectively. It was nominated for a 1991 Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 34th Annual Grammy Awards. \\"Here Comes the Hammer\\" was later included on Hammer's 1996 compilation album Greatest Hits. It was also included on the multi-artist compilation album Original Hits: Rap & Soul in 2010. Authorship controversy Besides utilizing James Brown's \\"Super Bad,\\" at least two other authors claimed that \\"Here Comes the Hammer\\" was based on their work. The band Legend claimed that the refrain chanting \\"uh oh\\" was taken from one of their songs. In addition, a musician named Kevin Abdullah sued Hammer claiming that the hook and refrain were taken from his song \\"Oh Oh, You Got the Shing,\\" and that \\"Here Comes the Hammer\\" \\"incorporated substantial and significant portions\\" of \\"Oh Oh, You Got the Shing.\\" Abdullah claimed that he had once auditioned \\"Oh Oh, You Got the Shing\\" for Hammer and sent Hammer a demo tape containing it, which Hammer rejected. Hammer eventually settled the suit for $250,000.

The MTV version of the video was almost 9 minutes long and a 15 minute version was also available. The plot of the video involves Hammer and his dancers getting chased through various rooms of a haunted house. New York Daily News critic Michael Saunders criticizes the video for emphasizing the lame plot over MC Hammer's dancing. Both Saunders and Entertainment Weekly critic James Farber criticize most of the expensive special effects, but Saunders does praise the effects use to create montages of Hammer dancing with James Brown, whose backing band is what Saunders believes is \\"the engine powering the single.\\" References Category:1990 singles Category:1990 songs Category:Capitol Records singles Category:MC Hammer songs Category:Songs written by MC Hammer ","title":"Here Comes the Hammer"},{"id":"62210910","text":"Vitaliy Mykhaylovych Yermakov (; born 7 June 1992) is a Ukrainian football player.

It includes Cumberland's town hall, located at 45 Broad Street in the village of Valley Falls, and an adjacent commercial building at 16 Mill Street, which was historically used for commercial and civic functions. The town hall, built in 1894, was the town's first purpose-built municipal building, and is a prominent example of Colonial Revival architecture, designed by Rhode Island architect William R. Walker. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. Description and history Cumberland Town Hall is located in the town's southernmost village, Valley Falls, at the northeast corner of Broad and Mill Streets. It is a tall three-story structure, its brick walls trimmed with stone and terra cotta. It is capped by a hip roof, and has a three-stage clock tower which is visible for some distance. Adjacent to the town hall at 16 Mill Street is a two-story brick commercial building. It has two store fronts, arrange symmetrically with plate glass display windows at the outside, and recessed two-leaf doorways near the center of the facade. Segmented-arch windows are placed above each storefront, and a corbelled and dentillated parapet tops the building. After Cumberland was incorporated in 1746, municipal records were typically stored in the clerk's home, and business was conducted in private homes or local commercial spaces. This situation continued through the town's significant industrial and population growth in the 19th century, until 1892, when the town appointed a committee to oversee construction of a town hall. The present structure was completed in 1894, on land given to the town by the Valley Falls Mill Company, its largest industrial concern. It was designed by William R. Walker, a prominent Rhode Island architect, and was stylistically similar to the town hall of Warwick. The adjacent commercial building had been built about 1890 by the Valley Falls Company to house a company store and the local library. The retail space was repurposed to house the Valley Falls post office, which had been displaced by the construction of the town hall.

He played college football at LSU. Early life and high school career Fulton was born and grew up in New Orleans, Louisiana and attended Archbishop Rummel High School, where he played football and ran track. He was named the New Orleans area Defensive Player of the Year by The New Orleans Advocate as a junior after finishing the season with 11 interceptions, 27 tackles and eight passes defended despite missing three games due to injury. Fulton was named first team Class 5A All-State as a senior and also was invited to play in the 2016 Under Armour All-America Game. Fulton was rated a five star recruit by 247 Sports and given a four star rating Rivals, Scout and ESPN and was rated a consensus top-5 prospect at the cornerback position. He committed to play college football at Louisiana State University over Florida and Arkansas. Fulton was also named first team All-State in track as a senior in the 300 meters hurdles. College career Fulton appeared in three games as a freshman, making two tackles. Following the season, Fulton was suspended by the NCAA for two seasons after he tampered with a drug test for performance enhancing drugs on February 2, 2017. He appealed the decision, arguing that he believed that the test was for recreational narcotics, but the initial appeal was denied in March 2017. Fulton sat out the entirety of the 2017 season, but remained with the team and participated in daily practices. Fulton then filed a second appeal after hiring an attorney arguing that proper drug testing protocol was not followed. The second appeal was also originally denied by a panel of NCAA officials on August 9, 2018, but the decision was overturned on August 23. Fulton entered his junior season as a starter at cornerback for the Tigers, despite not having played in a game in 18 months. He started the first ten games of the season for LSU before suffering a season ending ankle injury against Arkansas and finished the season with 25 tackles (one for loss), an interception, and nine passes defended. Entering his senior season, Fulton was named a preseason All-American by the Associated Press and the third-best defensive back in the nation by USA Today. He finished the season with 38 tackles, one interception and 14 passes defended as LSU won the 2020 National Championship. Professional career Fulton was drafted by the Tennessee Titans with the 61st overall pick in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft. He signed his four-year rookie contract on July 27, 2020. Fulton made his NFL debut in the Titans season opener against the Denver Broncos, making four tackles. In Week 2 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Fulton recorded his first career interception off a pass thrown by Gardner Minshew II and returned it for 44 yards during the 33‚Äì30 win.

His will left the residue of his estate to Oxford, to found in equal parts three chairs. By the 1850s the funds amounted to over ¬£12,000. The handling of the chairs, however, was not of free-standing professorships, and by the end of that decade the funds had been repurposed. Chair of Chemistry The initial holder of the Aldrichian Chair of Chemistry was John Kidd, from 1803. He resigned when the Regius Chair of Physic became vacant on the death of Christopher Pegge in 1822. Kidd made sure he was succeeded as Aldrichian Professor by Charles Giles Bridle Daubeny. For financial reasons Daubeny held onto the chair until 1854, when a college stipend he held was increased. The third and final holder of the Chair was Benjamin Collins Brodie, elected in 1855. It was renamed the Waynflete Chair of Chemistry in 1865. The funding was transferred in the 1870s to create the Aldrichian Demonstrator in Chemistry. Chair of Physic From 1803 to 1824 Robert Bourne was the first Aldrichian professor of physic. The title is also given as \\"medicine\\", and the endowment was described as \\"annexed\\" to the Regius Chair of that area. The endowment was also supposed to support an anatomy professor. In practice the anatomy funds were added to those from the benefaction of Richard Tomlins, to provide an anatomy reader. The anatomy funding was assigned to the Linacre Chair in 1858. George Oakley Aldrich George Oakley Aldrich, portrait c.1750 by Pompeo Batoni. Bodleian Library, Oxford. Born in 1721 or 1722, he was the son of Thomas and Grace Aldrich of Holborn, and was educated at Eton College. He matriculated at Merton College in 1739, with name registered as George Oakeley Aldrich. He graduated B.A. in 1742, M.A. in 1745, M.B. and M.D. in 1755. He went on the Grand Tour, and was in Rome in 1750 with John Neale, then an undergraduate at Merton, later parish priest at Tollerton, Nottinghamshire. While in Rome he had his portrait painted by the artist Pompeo Batoni; the portrait was rediscovered in the Bodleian Library's collection and after conservation treatment by Simon Gillespie was confirmed to be by Batoni himself. Aldrich built up a medical practice in Nottingham, and married in 1753 Anne Bland. Cockglode House, 1797 engraving In the 1770s Aldrich had moved on from residence at Mansfield Woodhouse, to Cockglode House near Edwinstowe in Sherwood Forest, which he began to build in 1774, and occupied under lease from the Duke of Portland from 1777. Aldrich married a second time, in 1783, to the much younger Sibylla Benson (died 1802), daughter of the Rev. Thomas Benson, rector of Bilsthorpe. Benson in 1770 had become curate at Ollerton Chapel, Edwinstowe. The Duke was Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 1792, and became Home Secretary in 1794. Thomas Beddoes, of radical views and initially a supporter of the French Revolution, was a reader in chemistry at Oxford from 1787 to 1793, when he left for Bristol. It has been suggested that Portland may have influenced Aldrich to include chemistry in founding by bequest the Aldrichian Chairs. In 1792 an Oxford Regius Chair of Chemistry, for which Beddoes would have been a candidate, was mooted but was then put on hold.Clive Emsley, Repression, \\"Terror\\" and the Rule of Law in England during the Decade of the French Revolution, The English Historical Review Vol. 100, No. 397 (Oct., 1985), pp. 801‚Äì825, at p. 802. Published by: Oxford University Press Aldrich died in 1797, and had no child as heir. After some individual legacies, his lengthy will left a considerable sum to found the three Chairs that bore his name. The portrait was given to the Bodleian Library by one of Sibylla's sisters, in 1837. The next tenant at Cockglode was Robert Shore Milnes, who left his position in Canada, which had brought him into contact with Portland, in 1805.

Parent is an American politician who served as the 29th mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Early life and education Parent was born Grand Isle, Maine. He attended elementary school in Grand Isle, Maine. He graduated from Van Buren Boys High School salutatorian of his class. Parent attended St. Francis Xavier University, where he graduated in 1961 magna cum laude with a bachelor degree in economics. From October 1961 through October 1963, Parent served in the Peace Corps. He was a member of the inaugural class of Peace Corps volunteers. He served in Thailand Group 1 for the duration of his service. He taught carpentry at Udorn Trade School and ESL at a Girls‚Äô Handicraft School. He also served as a volunteer field leader. Parent then attended the University of Notre Dame, from which he graduated in 1966 with a master's degree in education. Early career From 1967 through 1970, Parent was the executive director of the South Bend chapter of Neighborhood Development Centers. From 1971 through 1979 Parent was the executive director of the South Bend Office of Catholic Charities. From 1972 through 1980, Parent served as a member of the South Bend Common Council. For five of his eight years on the Common Council, he was its president. Mayoralty Parent was first elected mayor of South Bend in 1979, and was reelected to a second term as mayor in 1983. Parent was sworn-in as mayor in January 1980. Parent prioritized economic development. He sought to increase employment and the city's tax base by providing direct assistance to new commercial and industrial development. He also sought indirectly encourage new economic ventures by improving the city's amenities, particularly in its downtown. Among the key projects of Parent's mayoralty was the construction of the East Race Waterway whitewater facility. The idea for this project had predated Parent's tenure as mayor, and had been supported by his predecessor Peter J. Nemeth during the later part of his tenure. Ground broke on the project in 1982, and it was opened in 1984. The project had faced fierce opposition from \\"Fair Tax\\", a small citizen's association of St. Joseph County taxpayers. The opposition particularly dealt with the municipal bond issue Parent was pushing to fund the construction of the raceway along with several other projects. Fair Tax operated an opposition effort under the name \\"Citizens Information Exchange\\". Originally asking for a $5.6 million bond issue to fund not only the waterway, but also additional projects, Parent ultimately settled for a $3.2 million bond just to fund the waterway. Another key project he successfully championed in his first term was the construction of a $141 million dollar ethanol plant on the far west side of the city, which was designed to employ 150 people. The ethanol plant also faced opposition from \\"Fair Tax\\". In his first term, most of his redevelopment efforts were especially focused on the east side of South Bend's downtown business district. A key project of Parent's second term was the funding and the construction of Coveleski Stadium. Parent had advertised the stadium as being a generator that would contribute to the development of the nearby \\"Studebaker Corridoor\\", which he argued would be key for the redevelopment city's southwest quadrant. He announced plans for the stadium in March 1985. The stadium received some notable opposition from citizens and groups, including Fair Tax. The stadium was built, despite this opposition. As mayor, Parent believed that underutilized land at the 220 acre former site of the Studebaker's plant (located in the \\"Studebaker Corridor\\") could be a key asset in attracting new business and industry. However, this area did not see significant development during Parent's mayoralty, and would only far later see developments in the 2000s with the creation of such projects as Ignition Park. In 1987, South Bend hosted the Special Olympics World Games in conjunction with the nearby University of Notre Dame, with Parent playing a role. As mayor, Parent also created several task forces, councils, and commissions, and organizations, including the Task Force on Literacy, Council on Minority Affairs, Council on Older Adults, Commission on Energy Conservation, and the Business Development Corporation. During his tenure, Parent made a few hires which were the first for the city in regards to diversity. This included the city's first female city attorney, first African American fire chief, and first female director of code enforcement. Parent announced he would not run for a third term in the 1987 election. Rumors arose that this decision was precipitated by controversy surrounding the construction of Coveleski Stadium, and poor internal polling results for his prospects of reelection. Parent was succeeded as mayor by Joe E. Kernan in 1988. Post-mayoralty Immediately after leaving office as mayor, Parent returned to his work with the Peace Corps, serving as the Country Director for Haiti and Eastern Caribbean from January 1988 through June 1990. He also served in positions in the Peace Corps in Bulgaria and Grenada. In the early 1990s, Parent worked as the Deputy Commissioner of the Indiana Department of Mental Health. Parent served as Director of Development for Priests of Holy Cross from 1994 through 2003. From May 2005 through November 2005, Parent volunteered with the Crisis Corps in Thailand as a Deputy Director at the Tsunami Volunteer Center, working on the response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. In 2006, Parent and his wife Rolande Parent founded the international nonprofit World Dignity Inc. (WDI), for which he has served as president. The nonprofit aims to help the poor by offering such assistance as teacher and student scholarships. The nonprofit operates educational programs in South Bend, Thailand, and India. For five years, from 2009 through 2014, Parent served on the school board of the South Bend Community School Corp. For part of his tenure, beginning in January 2011, he was the president of the school board. Parent has also served on the Social Work Advisory Board of St. Mary's College, St. Frances Academy Board of Directors, Advisory Committee for the Coady International Institute at St. Francis Xavier University, Retired Indiana Public Retirement Association, and REAL Services Board of Directors. Parent supported Pete Buttigieg's, ultimately successful, candidacy for mayor of South Bend in 2011. Parent had endorsed Buttigieg at the start of his campaign. Personal life Parent continues to reside in South Bend. Parent and his wife Rolande Parent () have four children and six grandchildren. Parent is fluent in French and English, with some understanding of Thai and Haitian Creole. Parent is a hobbyist carpenter.

Commissioned by the Madrid Press Association (APM) to serve as corporative headquarters, the building's project was authored by Pedro Muguruza. The first sketches date from 1924. It was intended to provide a mixed use, including apartments for rent, offices, a movie theatre (ultimately located in the northern end of the plot) and a concert hall. The three different volumes the building features convey this circumstance. The 16-floor southern tower rises to a height of 58 metres. Buildings works started on 11 July 1925. Works finished by 1929. The building opened on 2 January 1930 with a projection of The Way of All Flesh, although it was formally inaugurated on 7 April 1930. After mortgaging the building because of huge debts accumulated during the Francoist dictatorship, the APM decided to move its headquarters to a small palace in the Salamanca district for free.

Braithwaite (19 July 1967 ‚Äì 30 September 2019) was a British scientist who was a Professor of Animal Behaviour and Cognition at Pennsylvania State University. She was the first person to demonstrate that fish feel pain, which impacted animal welfare research and changed guidelines for the treatment of fish in laboratories and fisheries in the UK, Europe, and Canada.  Early life and education  Braithwaite was born in Bradford. She was one of seven children. Her mother, June Pickles, was chair of the Halifax magistrates' bench, and her father, Alan Braithwaite, was a company director. She attended Bradford Grammar School, where she was not encouraged to apply to the University of Oxford. She did not take this advice, and eventually completed her undergraduate degree in zoology and doctoral degree, supported by a Christopher Welch scholarship, at the Somerville College, Oxford. Her thesis considered the visual information used by homing pigeons to return to their nests. She demonstrated that birds fly home faster when they see their surroundings before being released. She joined the University of Glasgow where she studied the cognitive abilities of salmon. It was during this project that she became interested in animal behaviour.  Research and career  Braithwaite spent her career investigating the cognitive abilities of fish and other animals. She showed that fish which live in stable environments (like ponds) use visual markers for guides, whereas fish that live in rivers learn directions using sequences (like left, right, left, right). Her research was the first to show that an animal's cognition is shaped by the worlds in which they live. To recognise her contributions to our understanding of animal navigation, Braithwaite was elected to the Royal Institute of Navigation in 2005. She moved to the University of Edinburgh in 1995 where she began to investigate whether or not fish felt pain - so-called nociception. Whilst it was well understood that chickens and sheep experienced pain, before Braithwaite it was not known whether or not fish did too. She demonstrated fish felt pain using a series of experiments, the first of which included showing that fish contained the correct anatomy to detect pain (nociceptors). She showed that fish produce pain-killing opioids in the same way that mammals do. She then investigated whether or not they responded to stimuli, and demonstrated that these receptors feel bodily damage and that fish behaviour is different when they are exposed to an unpleasant stimulus. She then demonstrated that fish that had been exposed to an unpleasant stimulus, for example, vinegar, behaved differently when made to perform tasks after they had taken human painkillers. Her work changed protocols regulating the ways fish are treated in laboratories and fisheries in the UK, Europe, and Canada. As of 2019 other countries were also considering making such changes. Braithwaite joined Pennsylvania State University in 2007, where she was appointed Professor of Fisheries and Biology. Here she demonstrated that providing a more natural environment for fish impacted their cognitive abilities and likelihood to survive in the world. Before Braithwaite's work, fish that had been reared in tanks did not survive when they were released into the world. Whilst a Visiting Fellow at the Berlin Institute for Advanced Study in 2015, Braithwaite analysed the inferences that could be made about animal pain and other emotional states. She was offered the directorship of the IGB Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries in 2018, but was unable to assume the position. = Selected publications = Her publications include:  *  Awards and honours  * 2005 Fellow of the Royal Institute of Navigation * 2006 Fisheries Society of the British Isles Medal * 2016 Fellow of the Linnean Society of London  Personal life  Braithwaite in 1992 married and eventually divorced the evolutionary biologist Andrew Read. Together they had two sons. In 2015 she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She died on 30 September 2019.

The river may have drained an area larger than the current day Amazon River from the Eocene (50 million years ago) to the Pliocene (3 million years ago) with the direction of drainage caused by the uplift of the Rocky Mountains. It is named after Canadian geologist Robert Bell who first proposed the concept in 1895. Development of the Paleo-Bell River theory In the late 1800s, Canadian geologist Robert Bell analyzed the flow of glacial ice during the Pleistocene working for the Geological Survey of Canada and from 1884 to 1885 explored the oceanography of Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait. During a meeting of the Royal Society of Canada in 1895, he proposed that before the Pleistocene glaciations a very large river drained portions of North America through the Hudson Strait. A few years later A.W.G. Wilson at McGill University supported Bell's claims, finding that the Canadian Shield beneath Hudson Bay eroded almost flat and then uplifted and warped in the recent geological past. Evidence for the Paleo-Bell River In the early 1970s N.J. McMillan, a geologist with Aquitaine Petroleum assessed the sediments in the Saglek Basin beneath the Hudson Strait. The sediment was deposited between 55 and five million years ago, but totaled to 2.5 million cubic kilometers, which was more than erosion from the uplands of Labrador and Baffin Island could explain. During the 1980s, University of British Columbia researcher V. Eileen Williams found fossilized pollen grains in the sediments, some dating back to the Mesozoic. Based on similar palynomorphs eroded out of sedimentary rocks and moved thousands of kilometers by the Orinoco River and Mississippi River, forming an additional piece of evidence in favor of the hypothesis. Alejandra Duk-Rodkin interpreted eastward-dipping erosional surfaces crossing the Mackenzie River as indications of the eastward flow of the river in the early 1990s. In a 2013 paper, James Sears from the University of Montana reanalyzed fossil pollen and identified an assemblages similar to those found in the Chinle Formation and Supai Group in the Grand Canyon, suggesting a connection to that region.https://www.earthmagazine.org/article/saglek-basin-sediments-suggest- grand-canyon-connection End of the river system The flow of water from the Grand Canyon region may have stopped around 16 million years ago due to eruptions of the Yellowstone hot spot. Isostatic depression of the crust by ice sheets during the Pleistocene deprived the Saglek Basin of sediment as rivers drained directly into the newly formed Hudson Bay. Much of the river's flow was taken up by the Mackenzie River Basin, leaving the Saskatchewan River and Nelson River as the last remnants of the system.

The track was written by Lali, Rec808 and Gino the Ghost, along with its producers Rafael Arcaute, Federico Vindver and √Ångel L√≥pez. In 2020, \\"Laligera\\" helped Rafael Arcaute, one of the song's producers, receive a Latin Grammy nomination for Producer of the Year. Background and composition \\"Laligera\\" is an infectious trap-pop song, which Lali defines as \\"heavier and stronger than any music [she has] done before\\". The empowering lyrics are about a girl who's independent and has the world in her hands. According to Lali, the song reflects a bit of where she comes from and where I grew up: a barrio in the south of Buenos Aires. In an interview with Remezcla, Lali said: \\"I grew up in a world with hard-working parents. We didn‚Äôt have a lot of money, but I had my dream\\". Music video The music video was filmed by Orco in the porte√±o neighborhood of Parque Patricios, where Lali was born. It shows her skating in a basketball court and hanging out with a group of dancers. Artistic roller skating was the discipline Lali practised as a little girl, which allowed her to show her talent to an audience for the very first time. The clip also features cameos by Gimena Accardi and Candela Vetrano. =Laligera: Desde Cero= On October 25, 2019, Lali released a six-minute documentary wih exclusive behind-the-scenes footage of the music video. The documentary, which was described as \\"a trip to Lali's childhood and beginnings\\", shows the singer's life beyond her artistic life. In Lali's words, \\"I wanted to go deeper into my roots, I didn't want it to be just a videoclip. It was important for me to make it from my most personal (and artistic) side\\". Critical reception Jessica Roiz of Billboard said that the song \\"further spotlights Lali's musical growth\\". E!

He was a member of the Long family and was the nephew of former governors Huey Long and Earl Long and the cousin of Senator Russell B. Long. Early life Long was born on May 4, 1923, in Winnfield, Louisiana, to Floyd Harrison Long and Birdie Long. His family moved to Pineville when he was a teenager and he attended Bolton High School. When his cousin Earl Long was running for Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana, Gillis gave campaign speeches for him at his school. In 1939, Long attended Louisiana State University for law, but was interrupted when he enlisted into the army in 1941 as a private. During World War Two he received a bronze star, five campaign stars, and the Purple Heart, and served at the Nuremberg trials before being discharged as a captain in 1947. Later that year he married Catherine Small, and four years later graduated from college with a bachelor and law degree. Political career In 1962, he was elected to the House of Representatives from Louisiana's 8th congressional district and was selected to be the assistant Democratic Whip. In 1963, he entered the Democratic primary for the Louisiana gubernatorial race, but came in third place with 15% of the vote. In 1964, he attempted to win reelection, but was defeated by his more openly segregationist cousin Speedy Long. In 1971, he entered the Democratic primary for the gubernatorial race again, but again came in third place, this time with 13% of the vote. After his cousin Speedy Long retired from office, Gillis Long decided to run for the House seat he had once held. He won and was re-elected six additional times. He rose to the position of Chair of the House Democratic Caucus, which he held from 1981 to 1984. During the 1984 presidential primaries, Long endorsed former vice president Walter Mondale. On January 20, 1985, Long died from heart failure in Washington, D.C., and a moment of silence was given for him at Ronald Reagan's second presidential inauguration. His wife Cathy won the special election to succeed him and served one term. In 1994 he was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame.

The sisters of Pomeyrol are mainly dedicated to prayer and host spiritual, festive or theological retreats. This community of deaconesses, recognized as a religious community by the Reformed Church of France in 1953, is inspired by the movement of the \\"Third Order of the Watchers \\", launched by pastor Wilfred Monod, and by scouting.  History  The creation of this community is due to Antoinette Butte (1898-1986), a committed French lay Protestant, leader of the French Women Scouts Federation from 1916 onwards, where she encouraged spiritual practicePierre Bolle, \\"Antoinette Butte, les √âclaireuses et l'√âvangile\\", .. In 1929, she opened a spiritual retreat centre in Saint- Germain-en-Laye and then, in 1937, the French Pastors Association asked her to take care of a house for spiritual retreats and meetings in Pomeyrol. During WWII, the occupation of France and the commandeering of the house of Saint- Germain en Laye by the Germans caused the community to regroup in Pomeyrol. It opened its door widely to numerous meetings of pastorals, catechetics, and adult movements, as well as to many refugees and fugitives. It is within this framework that the \\"Theses of Pomeyrol\\", one of the first acts of spiritual resistance to Nazism in France, were developed in 1941. The place was requisitioned in February 1944, ransacked, used by the French Forces of the Interior and then as a camp. It was only recovered, badly damaged, in 1946 and gradually restored with the support of Marc Boegner, the president of the Protestant Federation of FranceSite of the Pomeyrol community.. Then, in 1950, Antoinette Butte founded the Pomeyrol Community, a women's religious order dedicated to prayer, and she remained in charge as their prioress until her retirement in 1975. In November 1951, the three residents of the community dedicated themselves to each other and to the community for life at a hand laying ceremony. In 1955, a fourth sister took her solemn vows in the presence of the Regional President of the Reformed Church of France. Shortly afterwards, two sisters ensured, for three winters, a presence at the heart of the fighting theatre in AlgeriaCahiers de Pomeyrol n¬∞ 8, Re-issue of n¬∞ 6/1977 of \\"Faith and Life\\", pages 74 to 78. In 1953, the Regional Council of the Reformed Church of France officially recognized the Religious Community of Pomeyrol.  Philosophy  The Sisters of Pomeyrol dedicate themselves to the ministry of prayer, and thus to being \\"sentinels\\", \\"watchmen\\" in the Church and for the world. They follow the Rule of Saint Benedict. From its beginnings in Saint-Germain en Laye, the Community had lived an experience of faith. They prayed for the needed money and it came either from participants or from other donors. The philosophy developed by the community from 1950 onwards was \\"to live above all an openness to God, in prayer and in silence\\". A motto displayed by the community is: \\"God leads, prayer broods, people work.\\" The community does not make strategies or plans, it believes that it is God who acts through men and women. \\"Do not seek to do good, be in God; and good will just fall off your life as mature fruit falls off the tree.\\" Finally, the fact of being a small community of women is reflected by the Community of Pomeyrol in this expression of their calling: \\"The essential role of a small community of women is to be a matrix; it is a living cell that transmits life.\\"  Activities  The activities of the Pomeyrol community have developed organically and spontaneously from the initial \\"matrix\\": * Celebrations: in addition to the Sunday Protestant church service, the community celebrates with fervour the festivals of the Christian liturgical year, which attract many Christians from the region, both Protestant and Catholic. Parishes all over France call on the community to lead prayer vigils, retreats or preaching. * Participation in the life of the church: the sisters hold positions in the local or regional United Protestant Church of France: Elder of the neighbouring Protestant parish of Beaucaire, GardBeaucaire], catechism instructor, member of the Regional Ecumenical Commission, member of the Regional Commission for Evangelisation. * Retreats: The Pomeyrol community is very successful in its retreats that bring together people of all faiths. It offers a place of renewal or work to those who need serenity or who are looking for the direction to give their lives. * Ecumenism : Pomeyrol is located in Catholic Provence not far from the Huguenot part of Languedoc. It practices ecumenism actively. * Local animation: the neighbouring village is in close contact with the community. It benefits from the services of the sisters for visits and care. Deep friendships have been sealed. Donations in kind, sometimes generous, help people to live. * \\"Third order\\": the Community has shared its values and practices with a wider circle of more than a hundred men and women called \\"companions\\" who practice the spirituality of Pomeyrol in their family and professional environment. Their commitment is to detach themselves from their \\"selves\\" in order to dedicate their lives to God and to commit themselves concretely in the service of the Church and the spirituality of the Community, in the spirit of the Beatitudes. The discipline of \\"companions\\" commits them to practice daily meditation accompanied by the recitation of the Beatitudes or the Epistle on Love, to consecrate tithes to God and to make an annual retreat in a Christian community.  Governance  The sisters elect their prioress when it is time for her to retire. Thus, on February 17, 2019, after a year-long discernment process, Sister Martha Elisabeth was elected by the nine sisters currently in the community to succeed Sister Dani√®le, who had been the prioress of the community for 26 years. Thanks to the maturation process which was followed, the 9 sisters voted unanimously for this sister of Swiss origin. The transfer of powers was made in the presence of Emmanuelle Seyboldt, president of the United Protestant Church of France of which the community of Pomeyrol is a full member.

Hebridean women's lives  The Stornoway suffrage association was formed of 25 women, from a community very different from the middle class London or working class factory women joining the big city suffrage societies or the militant Women's Social and Political Union (suffragette) activities, elsewhere in Scotland and across Britain. Hebridean women were mainly heavy manual workers, strong physical women who worked gutting fish for the herring trawler industry, following the fleet locally, and travelling with other women from fishing villages around the coast of Scotland, and Britain gutting the fish in the herring season. Despite having no rights to vote, the women made a significant financial contribution to the islands (¬£75,000 p.a. before the First World War); or worked in crofting, in small plots growing crops and keeping animals, whilst their men were away at sea. Men contributed less overall for the islands prosperity (¬£25,000 p.a.) at that time than the fisherwomen. The notion of a woman's rights to work and travel was normal in coastal communities, making it a simpler case for equal franchise. The Stornoway Town Council supported the motion to give women the vote, before the Representation of the People Act (1918) made it real. Hebridean women, on the remotest island St. Kilda (now uninhabited) were among the first to vote. The munitions factories recruited these hard working women, taking 500 from the islands at the start of the war. Women from the islands, who were formally educated and went on to work internationally at that time, included Helen MacDougal, who became a doctor and radiographer in the Scottish Women's military hospital in Serbia, during the First World War, but less celebrated than her brother  Society Activities  The organisation like others in Scotland was affiliated to the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. Despite their rural setting, activities included members speaking at public meetings, distributing fliers, and writing articles in the local press to promote the cause of women's suffrage, and share what was happening, by having visiting speakers, even prior to the formation of the society, such as Jessie Craigen from the better known suffrage movement within the larger cities.  Legacy  A play 'Deeds Not Words' was commissioned and toured the Hebrides, on the centenary of women's right to vote, in 2018, researched and written by Toria Banks, directed by Muriel Ann Macleod, music by Mary Ann Kennedy, with a local and Scottish female cast and production team. This was sponsored by Rural Nations Scotland CIC and others, to celebrate women's suffrage movements in the Hebrides, a hidden history of local engagement in the national struggle for women's suffrage prior to 1918. Director Muriel Ann Macleod said about the research, the touring production and future museum display: > '‚ÄúEverything that celebrates the Hebrides changes perception and I certainly > hope people will think differently about their grannies and what they did.‚Äù'  Further reading  * King, Elspeth (1978) The Scottish Women‚Äôs Suffrage Movement.

It is an invasive fruit fly that originated in Africa, but can also be found in Europe and Asia. The fly earned its common name, the \\"vinegar fly\\", because researchers frequently captured the species using vinegar traps. Z. tuberculatus was previously considered a strictly tropical fly, but evidence of invasion to nontropical regions such as Turkey has been shown. This fly typically resides on rotting fruit, and the larvae have been found to develop on 49 species of fruits. The life cycle of the fly depends on the temperature of the environment as males are sterile at or above 30 degrees Celsius. It is reddish-brick colored and contains four longitudinal stripes down its head and body. The courtship behavior includes song singing and complex dance rituals. In regard to other organisms, Z. tuberculatus is considered a secondary pest to fruit and a potential threat to ecosystems it invades. A close relative, Z. indianus is an invasive fly species that infests fig orchards.  Taxonomy  Zaprionus tuberculatus was first discriminated from its close relative Z. sepsoids in the 1970s.Tsacas L, David J, Allemand R, Pasteur G, Chassagnard MT, Derridj S.(1977) Biologie √©volutive du genre Zaprionus. Recherches sur le complexe sp√©cifique de Z. tuberculatus (Dipt. Drosophilidae). Annales de la Soci√©t√© entomologique de France 13: 391-415 Z. tuberculatus has recently classified as a member of the Tuberculatus species subgroup and is a member of the inermis species group. Previously, Z. tuberculatus was classified as a member of the armatus group. The genus Zaprionus if primarily found throughout Africa and contains 59 species, the most common of which being Z. indianus and Z. tuberculatus.Patlar, B., Koc, B., Yilmaz, M. and Ozsov, E. D. 2012. First records of Zaprionus tuberculatus (Diptera: Drosophilidae) from the Mediterranean Region, Turkey. Drosophila Information Service 95: 94‚Äì96. The 59 species of the genus Zaprionus are divided into two subgroups: Afrotropical Zaprionus sensu stricto (s.s.), to which Z. tuberculatus belongs, and Anaprionus near Asia and Australia. Within the Zaprionus sensu stricto (s.s.) subgenus are several further subgroups, including the armatus subgroup to which Z. tuberculatus belonged until 2010.  Description  Zaprionus tuberculatus contains four white horizontal stripes across its head and thorax, similar to other members of the Zaprionus subgroup. The males bear hairs on its forelegs. Both male and female flies have a protruding bristle from the forefemur. The frons have a medium-white stripe and the aedaegus is robust and curved and they have a dark-brown colored thorax. Two white, aligned, horizontal lines characterize the mesonotum and metanotum. Z. tuberculatus shares several common features with other members of the genus Zaprionus, including a completely smooth larval cephalopharyngeal. = Reproductive system = Between individual flies, siblings are distinguished by testicular size (TST), for which the mean is 3.2mm. The average seminal recepaical (SR) of a female fly is 3.6mm.  Distribution  Zaprionus tuberculatus, originally from islands near the Indian Ocean and Afrotropical Region, then became invasive and expanded geographically to southern Europe. Within the Afrotropical region, the species has been reported in Mauritius, R√©union, Madagascar, Saint-Helena, Cape Verde, and Seychelles . The species had first been reported in Europe in Italy September, 2013. Z. tuberculatus has also been reported in North Africa, Malta, Cyprus, and the Canary Islands. Z. tuberculatus was trapped in Eastern Europe in Southern Romania between September and October 2014. Z. tuberculatus has been reported in a few other areas of Europe, including Spain, Greece, and Northern Italy. Z. tuberculatus has also been reported in Asian regions, including Israel and southern Turkey. = Habitat = alt= Zaprionus tuberculatus typically reside on rotting fruit and has been captured via the use of vinegar traps, which earned the species its nickname \\"vinegar fly.\\" The fly does not thrive in strictly tropical environments. = Ecology = Zaprionus tuberculatus is an invasive species, meaning its spread from one geographical region to other may harm to existing ecosystems.  Life cycle  Zaprionus tuberculatus life cycle varies depending on the temperature of the environment. Zaprionus tuberculatus males are sterile at or above 30 degrees Celsius. The mean Z. tuberculatus female life span varies from about 40 days to 60 days, whereas the mean male lifespan varies from about 50 to 200 days when temperature is varied. = Egg = The eggs of Z. tuberculatus have four filaments, with the posterior filaments being elongated more than the anterior filaments and are spatulated. The lengths of these filaments vary within species. = Larvae = The larvae of Z. tuberculatus generally grows on over- ripe fruits and has been found to develop on 49 species of fruits. Similar to other drosophilids, the larvae of Z. tuberculatus have a respiratory system containing thoracic and anterior spiracles on either side of the body, which is a systems organization referred to as amphipneustic. = Puparium = The pupae of Z. tuberculatus have a brick red color. The anterior branches belonging to Z. tuberculatus are clubbed type and vary in number from 11 to 14. The puparial shape (Puparial length:PI) of Z. tuberculatus is 2.59. Puparial shape is an important measurement because it distinguishes Z. tuberculatus from several closely related fly species, including Z. inermis (puparial shape =2.62), Z. cercus (puparial shape =2.40), and Z. burlai (puparial shape = 2.29). Similarly, another taxonomic measurement, the horn index (H) discriminates Z. tuberculatus (H= 7.0) from closely related fly species such as Z. verruca (H=10.6) and Z. burlai (H = 7.2). Unlike other species of Drosophila such as D. melanogaster, for Z. tuberculatus pupae synapsis is uncommon and tend to pupariate upwards relate to the ground instead of downwards. However, Z. tuberculatus pupae strongly aggregate similar to other Drosophila species.  Behavior  = Laboratory behavior = Zaprionus tuberculatus pupae are difficult to study experimentally because, when space in culture bottles become limited, pupae climb upwards to escape from the bottle and later die. This is true for all species of the genus Zaprionus, except Zaprionus lachaisei. = Pupation site selection = Though kin selection theory predicts Z. tuberculatus pupae should be more likely to aggregate in an intraspecific manner than interspecifically, Z. tuberculatus does not kin discriminate in site selection. = Species recognition = \\"Type 2\\" songs are sung between two male Z. tuberculatus flies and its function is species recognition.  Mating  = Male courtship behavior = The male Z. tuberculatus generally makes the first contact with the female Z. tuberculatus by grappling at the female, performing mating displays, then auditory display (song singing). The male performs stationary displays from the female Z. tuberculatus rear end at degrees of 90, 180, or 135 along the long axis of the female body. Still while singing, the male Z. tuberculatus then moves radially around the female in a quarter circle. From a further distance from the female compared to the circling display, the male Z. tuberculatus also performs a dancing which interrupts periods of singing or occurs after singing, but never before. Immediately preceding copulation, then for a second time at the beginning of copulation the male Z. tuberculatus also rubs his legs against the abdomen of the female Z. tuberculatus. The average length of Z. tuberculatus copulation is about 2.25 minutes.  Male songs  Male Z. tuberculatus produces two types of songs by vibrating its wings to generate audio. The two song types are designated either \\"type 1,\\" which is involved in male courtship, or \\"type 2,\\" which is used for species recognition both in male and female Z. tuberculatus flies. When one male mounts another, both males sing, possibly to recognize sex or intimidation tactic to deter other males from attempting to mate with the female Z. tuberculatus flies. = Female courtship behavior = At the conclusion of copulation, female Z. tuberculatus protrudes the abdomen and secreted a colorless liquid, which appears to repulse the male Z. tuberculatus. The chemical composition of the colorless liquid has not been studied.  Genetics  The Z. tuberculatus genome has five rod-shaped chromosomes and one dot-shaped chromosome. The number of type of chromosomes, or the karyotype, for Z. tuberculatus has not changed much throughout evolution, which supports Muller's linkage conservation hypothesis and explains the scarcity of pericentric inversions and translocations.Muller HJ, 1940. Bearings of the Drosophila work on systematics. In: The new systematics (Huxley J, ed). Oxford: Clarendon Press: 185-268. The transposable element mariner occurs in several species, including the Melanogaster species and in the genus Zaprionus.Maruyama, Kyoko.\\"Interspecific Transfer of the Transposable Element Mariner Between Drosophila and Zaprionus,\\" (PhD diss., Washington University in St.Louis School of Medicine,1991). The presence of mariner in the Z. tuberculatus occurs through horizontal transfer. Mariner is also present in several members of the melanogaster species subgroup. The rate of divergence of the mariner element between the two species subgroups suggests a slower evolution rate of the mariner transposable element. A slowing mariner mutation rate helps to explain low divergence in the melanogaster species subgroup, but fails to account for reduced divergence in Z. tuberculatus. The specific mechanism by which horizontal transfer of mariner occurs for Z.tuberculatus is currently unknown and is being investigated. Similarly, study of the retrosposon copia also revealed evidence supporting horizontal transfer between Z. tuberculatus and the melanogaster species subgroup.  Interactions with humans  Zaprionus tuberculatus is a pest in regions to which it has invaded and infects fruit. Z. tuberculatus is thus capable of negatively impacting fruit which humans eat, but it is unknown which fruit species are most negatively influenced. A close relative of Z. tuberculatus, Z. indianus, is an invasive fly species and a pest to fig orchards. However, the adverse ecological influences of Z. tuberculatus has only recently been investigated directly.Leivadaras J, Leivadara EI, Vontas J (2017) A new insect, drosophila Zaprionus tuberculatus (Diptera: Drosophilidae), affects the figs on Crete.

She was a notable member and courier for the anti-fascist resistance group around Harro Schulze-Boysen, later called the Red Orchestra by the Abwehr. Life Von P√∂llnitz was a diplomat's daughter and a member of the Young Communist League of Germany (KJVD) in Hamburg since before 1933. As a result of her background and extensive travel experience, she was not taken seriously by her peers in the communist group. In November 1993, she was interrogated for being a communist and she was badly beaten. When she hit back, she was imprisoned for two months in the Fuhlsb√ºttel prison. In 1934, von P√∂llnitz was again under scrutiny and was searched by a Gestapo official. The banned Rote Hilfe organisation booklet was found stuffed down her underpants but she managed to grab it, tear it up and swallow the small pieces of paper. However, she spent another two months in prison and was denied a driving license as additional punishment. The Gestapo soon realized she was not a fervent or dogmatic leftist, her excursions for the KJVD and later for the Communist Party of Germany being merely a reflection of her thirst for adventure. In the mid-1930s, with the help from her distant cousin Libertas Schulze-Boysen, she found a job as a short-hand typist at the news agency United Press. Later, she became a journalist under the direction of G√∂sta von Uexk√ºll. Schulze-Boysen group In 1937, von P√∂llnitz, by now an activist and anti-fascist, became friends with writer and pacifist G√ºnther Weisenborn. Both joined the private meetings usually held in the apartment of the sculptor Kurt Schumacher. Von P√∂llnitz, a rebel and adventurer, and Weisenborn, an anti-fascist, weren't prepared to sit in private meetings and stay silent about Hitler's tyranny. They both called for action. In the same year, von P√∂llnitz received information from Schulze- Boysen about the Spanish Civil War. This spurred her to prepare leaflets about the war, which she then passed to Elfriede Paul, who hand-posted them to letterboxes throughout Berlin. By that year, Schulze-Boysen had compiled a short information document about a sabotage enterprise planned in Barcelona by the German Wehrmacht. It was an action from \\"Special Staff W\\", an organization established by Luftwaffe general Helmuth Wilberg to study and analyse the tactical lessons learned by the Legion Kondor during the Spanish Civil War. The unit also directed the German relief operations that consisted of volunteers, weapons and ammunition for General Francisco Franco FET y de las JONS Party. The information that Schulze-Boysen collected included details about German transports, deployment of units and companies involved in the German defense. The group around Schulze-Boysen didn't know how to deliver the information. Given that von P√∂llnitz was planning to visit the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne that was being held in Paris between 25 May to 25 November 1937, the group decided that she should deliver the letter to the Soviet Embassy in Paris. In due course, von P√∂llnitz fulfilled her mission and placed the letter in the mailbox of the Soviet Embassy on the Bois de Boulogne. Unfortunately, the building was being watched by the Gestapo, and after posting the letter, von P√∂llnitz was arrested by the Gestapo in November 1937. In this context, the historian Heinrich Scheel recalled the words of a Gestapo commissioner: \\"During the Spanish Civil War, we sent people of ours to the International Brigade as spies. Schulze-Boysen knew their names and transmitted them to the Reds. Our people were then put on the wall.\\" The resistance group, fearing discovery and arrest, temporarily disbanded. The apartment of the Schulze-Boysen was searched and although the Gestapo had demanded the dismissal of Harro Schulze-Boysen, he only received an official reprimand at the Ministry of Aviation. On 5 July 1938, von P√∂llnitz was released from Gestapo imprisonment after five months. Once she was released, the group found that she was emaciated. Despite torture, she had kept silent and not revealed the reason for her trip to Paris.. Given that she had weak lungs, she was infected with tuberculosis in prison. On 15 June 1939, von P√∂llnitz, now seriously ill with pulmonary tuberculosis, was taken to a sanatorium in Switzerland on the advice of her doctor Elfriede Paul. She died there a few weeks later.

It is situated within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness on land managed by Wenatchee National Forest. Alaska Mountain is set between Alaska Lake and Joe Lake, northeast of Snoqualmie Pass, and southeast of Mount Thomson, which is also its nearest higher peak. The Pacific Crest Trail traverses around the south, east and north slopes of Alaska Mountain, and an off-trail hike leads to the summit. Precipitation runoff on the east side of the mountain drains into tributaries of the Yakima River, whereas the west side of the peak drains into tributaries of the Snoqualmie River. Climate Alaska Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The elevation range of this area is between about in the lower elevations to over on Mount Stuart. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

A Royalist army under Colonel Edward Ford, High Sheriff of Sussex, marching from Chichester to seize Lewes for the King encountered a smaller but more disciplined Parliamentarian army under Colonel Herbert Morley waiting for them on Muster Green. After Royalist musketeers fired \\"some\\" volleys, Morley's cavalry broke through the Royalist's advanced guard and, with the Parliamentarian infantry charging simultaneously, fought hand-to-hand; at least an hour of fighting ensued in which 200 Royalists were killed, wounded, or captured, resulting in the surviving Royalist forces routing and the Parliamentarians emerging victorious, saving Lewes from a Royalist assault, and pushing back the 1642 Royalist invasion of Sussex. The battle site of the Battle of Muster Green became and remained the furthest a Royalist army advanced through Sussex during the First English Civil War.  Background  At the beginning of the First English Civil War there was no obvious distinction by location, occupation, or social class that outlined who would declare their support for the Royalists and who would declare support for the Parliamentarians in Sussex. Although historians have tried to characterise the eastern half of the county as \\"staunchly Parliamentarian\\" and western parts as more sympathetic to the Royalist cause, this broad distinction obscures many localised variations, particularly in downland areas and some urban areas. For example, in Chichester, the church, gentry, and upper classes made clear their support was for Charles I while the rising merchant classes showed their sympathies lay with the Parliamentarians. The people of poorer standing, while making up the majority of the population, were much less eager to take up the cause of either side. It was soon clear that neither Royalists nor Parliamentarians would have control of Sussex without the use of force via a military campaign through the county. Sussex was of strategic and industrial importance to both sides during the war due to the cannon foundries and ironworks making up the Wealden iron industry in the High Weald, controlling which would have given a logistical advantage to the side that controlled them, and also because the Sussex coastline was one of the shortest routes to France ‚Äì potentially a source of smuggled arms, gunpowder, troops, and bullion, as well as other equipment and materials required to wage and win a civil war. The proximity to France also meant the county could be used as an escape route by the King ‚Äì another factor which made Sussex \\"a region that Parliament needed to keep under firm control\\". In wider context, when the King fled to Oxford in August 1642 after he raised his royal standard in Nottingham and officially started the First English Civil War, he held the north of England, most of the Midlands, the south west of England, and Wales. This meant that it was mostly obvious where strong Royalist support began and ended and, with Sussex, part of this 'front line' was at the boundary with itself and HampshireThe battle of Haywards Heath. (even though Hampshire was mostly sympathetic to Parliament, the Royalists held many isolated strongholds in the county such as Portsmouth, Basing House, and Winchester).Civil War in Southern England. Edward Ford, the Royalist leader at the battle, had been given a colonel's commission at the outbreak of war by Charles, who also made Ford the High Sheriff of Sussex in 1642. Ford offered his majesty \\"a thousand men, and to undertake the conquest of Sussex, though sixty miles in length\\" and began to raise forces accordingly. On 18 November 1642, Ford marched his Royalist army from Hampshire across the border with, and into, Sussex, whereupon he seized Chichester for the King. Ford then set his eyes on Lewes.  Prelude  Ford decided that he would lead his forces eastwards through Sussex and seize the important Sussex town of Lewes for the King. Ford marched his forces in a broad sweep of Sussex ‚Äì not heading directly along the coast from Chichester to Lewes but instead heading in a north-east direction to then move on Lewes from the north. Why Ford did this is unknown but it could have been to deliberately prolong his advance through Sussex and to Lewes to allow Ford to forcibly conscript more locals along the way, with the use of threats and force if need be, in order to swell his army (albeit with untrained rural folk) for his assault on Lewes. Either way, this decision eventually led Ford and his army to Cuckfield (roughly to the north west of Lewes) where he and his army set up camp. During the first week of December, Ford led his army out of Cuckfield and continued eastwards (probably marching down the modern Cuckfield-Haywards Heath route consisting of Broad Street, Tylers Green, and the B2272) and towards Haywards Heath. Haywards Heath would have been very different then from what it is today, as Haywards Heath as a large settlement is a relatively modern development kickstarted by the arrival of the London & Brighton Railway in 1841. In 1642, Haywards Heath mostly consisted of enclosed fields and copses with only a few houses and farms present being dotted about the landscape. There may well have been a small handful of buildings involved in the battle, including a building adjacent to the westernmost point of Muster Green called \\"Hen Davis House\\" in 1638.Haywards Heath Historic Character Assessment Report September 2005. On arriving at the western outskirts of Haywards Heath, Ford and his army were met by resistance in the form of a much smaller but more disciplined Parliamentarian force led by Colonel Herbert Morley, which was waiting for them on Muster Green.  Battle  The exact size of the Royalist army is unknown, however, Ford offered to fight for the King with \\"a thousand men, and to undertake the conquest of Sussex\\" so it is possible that the size of the Royalist army at Muster Green could have been circa 1,000 in size. The exact size of the Parliamentarian army is also unknown, although, it is known that they were outnumbered by at least four to one by the royalist army meaning that the Parliamentarian force possibly numbered at circa 250 ‚Äì what Morley's men lacked in numbers however, they made up for in discipline, being therefore a more effective fighting force than that of Ford's. Later research by historians has pointed to the fact that neither side possessed any artillery at the battle. A recorded Parliamentarian perspective of the battle survives, likely being from the \\"news\\" that reached London on 8 December of Morley's victory at Haywards Heath: The Parliamentarians fought with \\"great fierceness\\" in bloody hand-to-hand combat inflicting heavy casualties on the less disciplined Royalists; Morley then sent his reserves up to exploit this and completed the rout of Ford's army. The fighting lasted for roughly an hour and resulted in at least 200 Royalists killed, wounded, or captured, while the figure for the Parliamentarian casualties is unknown. Ford's forcibly conscripted locals, recruited during Ford's broad sweep of Western Sussex, broke first, threw down their arms, and dispersed into the surrounding countryside; Ford and Thanet soon fled with their cavalry back to Chichester, leaving their surviving infantry (who had now scattered) to fend for themselves. The battle ended with the Royalists routed, retreating and dispersing from the battlefield ‚Äì the Parliamentarians had decisively won the battle and spared Lewes from a Royalist assault.  Aftermath  = Subsequent events = St Margaret's Church, West Hoathly, it is hypothesised that after the battle a routed group of Royalists fled into this church while under fire After the battle, the Royalists were routed and driven from the battlefield ‚Äì the battle site of the Battle of Muster Green became and remained the furthest a Royalist army advanced through Sussex during the First English Civil War., Warfare in West Sussex The forcibly conscripted locals were the first to break and were routed, fleeing southwards to Ditchling, Hurstpierpoint, and other neighbouring villages. Concurrently, the defeated Ford \\"conveyed himself away and left his men in the lurch to shift for themselves\\", then Ford in the company of Thanet, his officers, and their cavalry \\"flying with all speed up to the not distant downs, and so to Wissum (\\"Wissum\\" being a misspelling of Wiston) to the Earl's house\\", (\\"the Earl's house being Wiston House which was later occupied by Royalist forces and then by Parliamentarian forces) and then from there back to the previously captured city of Chichester, where they (among others) were later besieged that December during the Siege of Chichester by the Parliamentarians under Sir William Waller and taken prisoner after the Royalist resistance surrendered on 27 December 1642. News of the Parliamentarian victory at Haywards Heath reached London on 8 December. It is hypothesised by historian Philip Pavey that a group of routed Royalist stragglers retreated in a north easterly direction, while being pursued by Parliamentarians, and ended up north east of Muster Green in West Hoathly. Here, Pavey describes how the retreating Royalists fled for safety into St Margaret's Church whereupon slamming the door shut behind them, they came under fire from Parliamentarian musketeers ‚Äì the lead musket balls impacted the heavy wooden door to the church leaving half a dozen semiglobular impact marks \\"roughly about the size of Maltesers\\" and are still visible on the outside facing surface of the door today, although smoothed and shined with age like the rest of the door, and are the basis of this hypothesis. What happened to these Royalists inside St Margaret's Church if they were ever there is not known, however the impact marks on the door suggests ill-intent from the Parliamentarians and a grisly end for the Royalists., War comes to West Hoathly. Haywards Heath war memorial in 2009, situated on the westernmost edge of Muster Green, the direction from which Ford's Royalist army approached = Battle site today = The surrounding area of the site of the battle has changed and developed significantly since the time of the battle in 1642. Muster Green can be made out on the 1638 Manorial Map of Great Haywards Demesne and is surrounded by fields but little development. With the coming of the London & Brighton Railway in 1841, Haywards Heath began to urbanise exponentially and Muster Green saw itself slowly encroached upon by newer and newer buildings. Today, Muster Green is completely enveloped by urban sprawl, however, its shape has not changed as historically it was a green space between two diverging roads (the B2272 in the south and Muster Green North in the north).Haywards Heath Town Council Neighbourhood Plan Our Bright Future December 2016. Muster Green nowadays is a well maintained village green and has been awarded the Green Flag Award numerous times for being \\"one of the very best in the world\\". Haywards Heath war memorial is also located on the westernmost point of the green. An informative and commemorative plaque on a lectern is situated on the easternmost point of the green describing the Battle of Muster Green. This was installed by the local council at the recommendation of historian Philip Pavey in June 2015, although, the plaque commemorates the Battle of Muster Green as the Battle of Haywards Heath.

It was founded by a retired chiropractor and real estate entrepreneur named Robert Boback in 2004. The company specialized in trawling the deep web, investigating peer to peer networks, and helping businesses counteract data breaches and other cybersecurity risks. Its main product was EagleVision X1, a piece of software that monitored the deep web -- the parts of the Internet that are not easily accessible to general browsers, such as peer-to-peer networks -- for sensitive data.  History  Before entering the cybersecurity field, Boback was a chiropractor and real estate entrepreneur. He started Tiversa in 2004 as a two-person shop. Tiversa quickly obtained a high-profile board of advisers, including Maynard Webb (former eBay executive and chairman of Yahoo), Howard Schmidt (Obama-era cybersecurity chief), and Wesley Clark (former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO). = Marine One hack = In 2009, Tiversa claimed to have discovered a major security breach involving then-President Barack Obama's helicopter, Marine One. The breach involved the leak to Iran of sensitive procurement information about the helicopter as well as the helicopter's blueprints. According to Tiversa's CEO, the breach was caused by a defense contractor employee whose daughter downloaded a peer-to-peer file-sharing client onto a disused laptop which contained the sensitive materials. This discovery made national news, but a whistleblower later claimed that the Iranian hack was actually fabricated by Tiversa employees. Boback, the CEO of Tiversa, denied the allegation. = LabMD scandal = In May 2008, a Tiversa executive contacted LabMD (a urology testing laboratory) claiming to have discovered evidence of a major data breach and offered to sell LabMD monitoring services to counteract the breach. When the head of LabMD declined to purchase the monitoring services, Tiversa allegedly leaked information about the breach to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which pursues cybersecurity issues. The FTC launched a probe into LabMD's practices under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act in 2010, which evolved into a formal administrative complaint in 2013. LabMD's revenues fell and the business itself collapsed in 2014 due to the costs of litigating the case. However, in November 2014, an administrative law judge threw out the complaint against LabMD, citing a lack of reliability in the evidence provided by Tiversa to the FTC. This stemmed from a whistleblower complaint by a former Tiversa employee, Richard Wallace, who claimed that he was the one who breached LabMD's systems and that LabMD's data was never leaked outside of its network. He also alleged that Tiversa was responsible for the FTC complaint against LabMD, which was made in retaliation for LabMD's refusal to purchase Tiversa's monitoring services. = Federal probe = Following Wallace's whistleblower complaint, the federal government began probing Tiversa under allegations that it deliberately provided false information about data breaches to the FTC to retaliate against companies that declined to purchase its data protection services. The Department of Justice launched a criminal investigation in 2015 following the whistleblower complaint and the FTC also launched a probe of whether Tiversa had lied about any among the 80 companies that it had reported to them. = Acquisition by Kroll Inc. = In June 2017, Tiversa was acquired by Kroll Inc. and its employees were hired to maintain the Tiversa investigation systems.

This gave the definition of \\"detention order\\" a wide meaning.Minister for Justice and Equality v Daniel O'Connell [2019] IEHC 95 The case involved an appeal against extradition to the United Kingdom.  Background  The facts involved the issue as to whether a hospital order (i.e. inpatient treatment) with a restriction order attached to a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) would qualify as a \\"detention order\\" under the meaning of s.10(d) European Arrest Warrant Act 2003. s10(d) of this Act provides that: > \\"10. Where a judicial authority in an issuing state issues a European arrest > warrant in respect of a person‚Äî ‚Ä¶ * (d) on whom a sentence of imprisonment > or detention has been imposed in respect of an offence to which the European > arrest warrant relates, and who fled from the issuing state before he or > she‚Äî ** (i) commenced serving that sentence, or ** (ii) completed serving > that sentence,that person shall, subject to and in accordance with the > provisions of this Act and the Framework Decision, be arrested and > surrendered to the issuing state.\\"s.10(d) European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 In this case, the EAW in question was connected to two offences, which were rape and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The EAW related to a convicted mental patient who escaped from lawful custody. An order was made in the context of the Mental Health Act 1983 which contained preventative and punitive components. The appellant was sought by the United Kingdom on this warrant. In the High Court, the main issue was whether by the EAW the hospital order with its restrictions attached (which also contained an indefinite duration, subject to review of the Mental Health Tribunal) was a \\"detention order\\" (justifying the appellant's surrender to the United Kingdom). To the trial judge held: > \\"I am satisfied, and there is no room for controversy in this respect at > least, that the Hospital Order and Restrictions is not regarded as a > sentence of imprisonment under the law of the United Kingdom. That much is > clear. Equally clear in my view is that it constitutes and order for the > detention of the respondent, if one adopts a literal meaning of the word > \\"detention\\". However, as Ms Donnelly has stated, it cannot be the case that > every form of detention or deprivation of liberty comes within the meaning > of a detention order under the Framework Decision and the Act. ... only a > detention imposed or capable of being imposed following a conviction for a > criminal offence has the capacity to be a detention for the purpose of the > Framework Decision https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- > content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32002F0584&from;=EN Council Framework Decision > of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures > between Member States and the Act\\" He concluded: > \\"it is therefore possible for this court to give an interpretation to the > provisions of section 10(d) of the Act which is in conformity with the > objectives and intent of the Framework Decision, and which is not contra > legem [against the law]. It is that interpretation which must be given in > those circumstances, rather than one which would exclude the respondent from > being a person in respect of whom a European arrest warrant may be issued, > thereby preventing his surrender.\\"  Holding of the Supreme Court  The Supreme Court upheld the judgement in the High Court and dismissed the appeal. As the hospital order had been handed down by a criminal court instead of a prison sentence, it constituted a ‚Äúdetention order‚Äù. The High Court was, therefore, correct in ordering the surrender of the appellant to the United Kingdom. As Denham J noted: > \\"I would define a detention order under s.10(d) as any order involving > deprivation of liberty which has been made by a criminal court in addition > to or instead of a prison sentence. In this case the detention order was > made by a criminal court after conviction, for the extraditable offences of > rape and assault occasioning bodily harm, instead of a prison sentence.

In 2019, Ichigo became a top partner of the J.League, Japan's professional football league, in an agreement that will allow Ichigo to renovate and manage stadiums. In renewable energy, it is one of Japan's largest independent solar power producers, owning or operating 60 solar and wind plants across Japan as of February 2020, including the largest solar plant in the Kanto region around Tokyo. It is building a wind farm near Fukushima, and also operates floating solar plants. In 2017, Ichigo opened one of the first boutique hotels in Japan, in the port city of Yokohama. Ichigo opened a second boutique hotel in Tokyo's Shinjuku district, and is now building and operating boutique hotels across Japan. In 2019, Ichigo started investing in Japanese anime, including the latest production by Mamoru Oshii, known for Ghost in the Shell. The series, called Vladlove, is written by Oshii and co-directed by Junji Nishimura. The move has been described in The Japan Times as part of a new wave in financing Japanese anime that will challenge the ‚Äúsclerotic production committee system‚Äù and give more creative freedom to directors like Oshii. Ichigo also owns the Akiba Cultures Zone, a large retail building in Tokyo's Akihabara neighborhood that is a center for Japan's anime subculture. Ichigo builds and leases smart greenhouses, which use sensors and processors from the IoT (Internet of Things) to optimize levels of CO2, water and other inputs to increase agricultural yields. The company was founded in 2000 as Asset Managers, which was a leader in the securitization of nonperforming loans. In 2008, Ichigo Asset Management, a long-term Japan investor, became its largest shareholder. The company changed its name to Ichigo Group Holdings two years later, and in 2015 simplified that to Ichigo Inc. The name comes from Ichi-go ichi-e, an ancient Japanese idiom meaning ‚Äúone lifetime, one encounter.‚Äù The company also sponsors several internationally competitive athletes, including Olympic medalist weightlifter Hiromi Miyake, who has been an Ichigo employee since 2007.

They performed from 1952 to 1957, when founder John Meredith disbanded the group and its members dispersed into other activities. (An unrelated group with a similar sounding name, \\"The Bushwackers\\", formed in Victoria, Australia in 1971 and continues to the present day.) Over its relatively brief existence, the group evolved from an initial novelty act to one with a more serious mission of presenting and promoting to Australia its neglected bush song heritage, and laid the foundation for similar groups to follow through the 1960s and to the present. Its members also operated‚Å†‚Äîat least initially‚Å†‚Äîfrom a Marxist / Australian Communist Party ideology, attempting to embody the struggle of the working class against the ruling classes, although this may have been less than obvious to their audiences under the guise of popular entertainment. Band formation and source of name The Bushwhackers on the set of the play \\"Reedy River\\", 1953-1954. L-R: Harry Kay, Cecil Grivas, John Meredith, Brian Loughlin, Chris Kempster. The group was originally formed as \\"The Heathcote Bushwhackers\\" in the outer Sydney suburb of Heathcote in 1952 by folklorist John Meredith together with his neighbours Jack Barrie and Brian Loughlin, to perform and popularise \\"bush music\\" and later, Australian songs that Meredith had started to collect in the field from traditional performers.National Library of Australia: Trove: Bushwackers Musical group.. Note, the NLA mis-spells Loughlin's surname as \\"Loughlan\\"; \\"Loughlin\\" is correct according to other sources. In Australia, the term \\"to bushwhack\\" most commonly means to make one's way through the scrub or forest (\\"the bush\\") by \\"whacking\\" (cutting) a trail where none currently exists; a \\"bushwhacker\\" therefore means either such a traveller, or more generally, either a person who lives in such country, that is, off the beaten track, or simply a resident of the countryside in general (by implication, an unsophisticated person, similar to the U.S. term \\"hillbilly\\") as opposed to a resident of the city or the suburbs. It seems likely that, at least at first, the group name was intended to be ironic, since Heathcote, although indeed a rural / \\"bush\\" area at that time, was basically a retreat for escapees from city life in search of a more rural lifestyle, who were attracted by cheap land for sale there while still with regular rail links to Sydney.\\"Heathcote and the Birth of the Bushwackers, 1952-1953\\". Chapter 9 in McKenry, Keith: More Than a Life: John Meredith and the Fight for Australian Tradition. Rosenberg Publishing, 2014. Meredith resided in Heathcote from 1952 (when he moved there to share a somewhat primitive owner-built dwelling with its builder, Eric Burnett, an ex- roommate from Sydney) up to mid 1954, when he returned to the inner Sydney suburbs, taking up lodgings in Lewisham in order to avoid the long train commute from Heathcote to his job in the city, in addition to his burgeoning city-based musical activities. In its initial lineup, the group's instrumentation was button accordion and tin whistle (played by Meredith), \\"bush bass\\" or tea chest bass played by Barrie (actually not a traditional \\"bush\\" instrument at all, but one previously played by sailors and \\"wharfies\\"), while Loughlin played the lagerphone, a home-made percussion instrument constructed by loosely nailing bottle tops to a broom handle to make a rattling sound when struck upon the floor, this example being constructed and named by Meredith's brother Claude and copied from something he had seen played by \\"an old rabbitter\\".Mulga Wire, April 2002, p. 12. Years later, Meredith gave the following account of their formation: \\"Botany Bay\\" and Click Go the Shears\\" were in fact learned from the repertoire of the American singer Burl Ives, who had toured Australia earlier that year and had included these and some other Australian songs in his performances, having been supplied with them in advance by the Australian collector Dr. Percy Jones.ABC Radio National, Sunday 31 August 2014: How Burl Ives popularised Australian folk songs (Later these formed the basis of Ives' own albums 9 Australian Folk Songs (10\\", Australia, 1954) and Australian Folk Songs (USA, 1958.) Of the new recruits to the band, Chris Kempster (thirteen years younger than Meredith, and a singer on occasion to his own guitar-based accompaniment) was known to him via the Sydney based left-wing organisations the Eureka Youth League and the Unity Singers, of which both were members, while Harry Kay, also from the Eureka Youth League, played excellent harmonica. They group gave its first public performance at the Rivoli Hall in Hurstville in late 1952, deciding to shorten its name to just \\"The Bushwhackers\\" at the same time. \\"Reedy River\\" In 1953 \\"Reedy River\\", an Australian musical written by Dick Diamond featuring bush and Australian folk music, opened first in Melbourne and then as an amateur production at the Sydney New Theatre, and the Bushwhackers were engaged to provide the musical accompaniment for the Sydney version, which saw the addition of one song \\"Widgegoeera Joe\\" (alternate title: \\"The Backblocks Shearer\\") which Meredith had collected earlier that year from a bush singer named Jack \\"Hoopiron\\" Lee.McKenry, Keith. 2014. \\"More than a Life: John Meredith and the Fight for Australian Tradition.\\" Rosenberg Publishing, 488 pp. The production also included \\"Click Go the Shears\\", which although credited in the Reedy River Song Book to versions collected by Meredith in the field, actually derived mostly from the Burl Ives version that the band had originally learned. Performing as singers in the musical were Chris Kempster and Harry Kay, joined later in the season by Cecil Grivas, Alex Hood and Alan Scott, all of whom subsequently became assimilated into the band.Australian Folk Songs: The Bushwhackers: Some recollections - Chris Kempster, February 2002 Around this time, the group also supplied the songs and music for several historical radio features written for the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) by Nancy Keesing. Subsequent activities John Meredith in 1987 In 1954 the Bushwhackers, along with other folklore enthusiasts, established the Sydney Bush Music Club to encourage members of the Club and the general public to learn about and perform Australian folk and traditional music; an additional reason was to deflect more requests from interested parties to join the band, instead encouraging them to perform at the club and/or form their own groups. The band travelled outside Sydney into rural New South Wales, and Meredith and Scott often used their performances to scout out local bush musicians and singers for field recordings. In 1955 the group played for Dame Mary Gilmore's ninetieth birthday and recorded The Drover's Dream, released as a 78 rpm record on the newly established \\"Wattle\\" label, selling thousands of copies, followed by a number of other 78 recordings, as well as two 33 rpm EP releases, Australian Bush Songs and Nine Miles from Gundagai (both 1957). Other local groups taking inspiration from the Bushwhackers and/or the Bush Music Club around that time, performing similar music, included \\"The Overlanders\\" (from Leichhardt), \\"The Spraggers\\", \\"The Rouseabouts\\", and \\"The Drovers\\".Minutes of the Bush Music Club, 14th October 1954 to 11th March, 1955. Reproduced at http://bushmusicclub.blogspot.com/2017/01/minutes-of-bush-music-club-14th- october.html. Remembering some of the group's activities some 25 years later, member Alan Scott wrote: Although happy to commence, and then to continue the existence of the group under the general public perception as popular entertainment, Meredith and the other members were affiliated to the Australian Commununist Party, at that time very much a focal point for idealistic youth, in particular following the end of the second world war, together with its Marxist ideology and various offshoots such as the Eureka Youth League; in this respect, his aims paralleled those of folk-song activists working in America since the 1940s such as the Almanac Singers and The Weavers. As well as representing the struggle of the working class against the capitalist system, Meredith wanted the group to be at the vanguard of a movement to regain a national cultural identity. In his own papers of the time he wrote: A contemporary account of the band's activities in the respected newspaper the Sydney Morning Herald reads as follows: Demise of the group Chris Kempster in 1992 With very little notice to the group members, in 1957 Meredith abruptly decided to disband the group (minus Grivas, who had departed in 1955 due to a change in location), citing in his personal notes musical and personal differences between the older and younger members of the band: for example Kempster and Hood aspired to harmony singing, occasional solo vocals and more variety in the arrangements, Meredith's conception only involved solo singing in the verses, unison singing in the choruses, plus all the instruments playing all of the time. (By contrast, group member Alan Scott stated that in his opinion, the constant touring and rehearsing had simply got too much for Meredith, who \\"could not cope with all his other activities and be a Bushwhacker too\\".) Various of its members continued to perform in bush bands: Kempster, Hood and Kay initially as \\"The Three Bushwhackers\\" and then continuing as \\"The Rambleers\\"; Grivas with his brothers Roland and Milton as \\"The Galahs\\", already formed post his 1955 departure from the Bushwhackers; while Meredith continued to collect field recordings of Australian traditional and folk music, as well as performing with \\"The Shearers\\" and the Bush Music Club's \\"Concert Party\\". Reunions Alex Hood and Chris Kempster at Australia's National Folk Festival, Easter 2000 Three former members of the original Bushwhackers with their later associate Barbara Lisyak at the Ilawarra Folk Festival at Jamberoo, 2002. L-R: Barbara Lisyak, Chris Kempster, Alex Hood and Harry Kay. There were no reunions of the group during Meredith's lifetime; while he remained good friends with Loughlin and the latter's family, and also subsequently occasionally happily performed with Alan Scott, Meredith reportedly never forgave Kempster, Kay and particularly Hood for their attitudes which in his mind precipitated the demise of the Bushwhackers, as well as their later performing careers which included songs learned during their tenure with the Bushwhackers but uncredited as such on later recordings.McKenry, pp. 218, 219, 385 Nevertheless, the surviving band members - apart from Cec Grivas, who was not in attendance - were present at a celebration of Meredith's life held at Gay Scott's Balmoral property in March 2001, a month after his death, and were persuaded to give a brief impromptu performance.McKenry, Keith: More Than a Life: John Meredith and the Fight for Australian Tradition. Rosenberg Publishing, 2014. The following year, members of the band played two 50th anniversary reunion concerts at the 2002 Australian National Folk Festival and the National Library in Canberra, plus there was an anniversary performance of Reedy River. Original members Cecil Grivas, Alex Hood, Harry Kay and Chris Kempster all took part, together with Meredith's long time friend and collecting associate Rob Willis who took the musical part of Meredith; Jack Barrie was unable to attend but sent his best wishes,Mulga Wire, April 2002, pages 12 & 13; reports reproduced at http://bushmusicclub.blogspot.com/2019/01/50th-anniversary-reunion-of_4.html and http://bushmusicclub.blogspot.com/2019/01/50th-anniversary-reunion- of.html, together with photographs of the performances, Brian Loughlin having passed away earlier, in 1974. Kempster, Hood and Kay also took part in a Rambleers reunion the same year, along with their later musical associate Barbara Lisyak. Subsequently, Kempster died in January 2004 aged 70, Barrie in August 2015 (two years short of his one-hundredth birthday), and Grivas in August 2019 aged 88. Influence and legacy Meredith's \\"Bushwhackers\\" had a musical influence far greater than their brief, 5-year life span, virtually single-handedly starting the entire Australian \\"bush music\\" revival of the 1950s, which still continues today in various forms (not least via the auspices of the Sydney Bush Music Club which Meredith and the group co- founded), as well as starting the wider Australian \\"folk revival\\" only a few years following its equivalent in the United States. Meredith's biographer, Keith McKenry, notes that the group In that mission, the group certainly succeeded, also assisted by the popular success of \\"Reedy River\\" which brought its included bush songs to a wide audience as well as introducing the then- novel concept of allowing the accompanying musicians to play their instruments on stage rather than out of sight, a precursor to numerous \\"folk song\\" performances that were to follow. Direct successors to the original group, such as \\"The Rambleers\\", continued Meredith's vision (with or without his blessing) in both live performances and recorded output. Writing in 2004, and following the gift of the group's original \\"lagerphone\\" to the National Library of Australia after the group's reunion performance at the National Folk Festival in 2002, curator Mark Cranfield wrote: Unrelated group An unrelated group with a similar sounding name, \\"The Bushwackers\\" (note slightly different spelling), initially \\"The Original Bushwackers and Bullockies Bush Band\\", formed in Melbourne, Australia in 1971 and continues to the present day.

There are over 70 described species within the Pseudacteon genus, which parasitize a variety of ant species. However, P. tricuspis is very specific to its host ant and will not attack other native ant species, making it a good biological control against the fire ant. P. tricuspis was also introduced into the United States for this purpose. Aside from the United States, P. tricuspis has also been found in South America, Europe, and Asia. Female P. tricuspis deposit their eggs directly into the fire ant host. Deposition into the ant host determines the sex of the egg, which grows within the host until adulthood, killing and decapitating the host in the process. Interestingly, P. tricuspis has a male-biased sex ratio, where the males are smaller than the females.  Description  P. tricuspis is a species of the Pseudateon genus and a member of the family Phoridae, which is commonly called scuttle flies, humped-back flies, and phorid flies. Eight native Pseudacteon species parasitize native fire ants in the United States (Plowes 2009). The adult P. tricuspis flies are 0.9-1.5mm in length. The mandibles of the larvae are unable to chew or digest food and are instead used to aid in movement and anchoring within the host. The ovipositor, which is the organ that is used by the female to lay eggs, has a looks different in all species within the Pseudacteon genus and can be used to distinguish the species from one another.  Distribution  P. tricuspis is widely distributed around Argentina, Brazil, and other parts of South America, Europe, and Asia. About two dozen species of the genus parasitize native fire ants in South America. Since its introduction to the United States, the species can be found across the country, but is concentrated along the south east parts, including Florida, Alabama, Arkansas, and Louisiana. = Habitat = Solenopsis invicta, host of P. tricuspis P. tricuspis is predominantly found within the natural range of where the host Solenopsis invicta fire ant can be found. Climates range from rain forests to swamps to dry areas. They are not preferential to any sort of habitat, partially because P. tricuspis live the majority of their lives within the host. P. tricuspis is not known to be attracted in large groups to anything but the host ant.  Life history  P. tricuspis will spend a majority of its life cycle within the host ant, even after the host dies. Development time from egg deposition to mature adult is 5 to 12 weeks, depending on temperature (with increased longevity at lower temperatures). Sex determination is dependent on the size of the host ant that the egg is deposited within. The female flies have a greater average fitness if they are using larger host fire ants. However, the exact mechanism of how this sex determination occurs is unknown. = Egg = The eggs of the fly are approximately 130 ¬µm long by 20 ¬µm wide. They have the shape of a torpedo and are injected into the thorax of the worker fire ant by the mother. The egg usually takes around 4‚Äì5 days to finish embryonic development and hatch. = Larvae = The fly hatches from the egg in the first instar and will usually shed their serosa within 24 hours, although the process has been recorded to last up to 20 days. By day four the second instar typically will have situated itself fully within the ant's head. During both the second and third instar the fly maggot relies heavily on ant hemolymph for nutrition. During this time, the host fire ant appears and behaves normally because the parasite fly does not consume tissue. The third instar will then release an enzyme or hormone that will loosen and decapitate the head of the host ant, which the fly then eats and resides inside. = Pupae = The pupae are opaque and have a pale color. The fly will stay inside the head capsule and grow, filling the shape of the host‚Äôs head capsule. The females will have developed fully formed wings. Pupal development takes around 2‚Äì6 weeks, dependent on temperature. = Adult = When the adult fly is fully grown, emergence from the host fly takes only a few seconds in total and are ready to mate and lay eggs within the next few hours. The adult lifespan is only 3 to 5 days.  Food resources  Honeydew leaf The flies use fire ants' semiochemicals to locate the fire ant species Solenopsis invicta and can do so from up to 50 meters away. While other species within the Pseudacteon genus have been found to be generalists and feed on a wide range of resources, in the field the P. tricuspis fly will only feed on its host. However, research in laboratories has found that feeding the fly sugar has a significant effect on increasing the lifespan of the fly, with longevity increasing by a factor of 2 to 3. In the field, the parasites could potentially obtain sugar from nectar or honeydew, but provision of supplemental sugar sources around release sites of the fly may improve the success rate of the fly as a control for the fire ant.  Mating  Males have a long sensilla subtype within their antennae that is absent in the females. While its purpose is not completely clear, it is thought to detect female odors, such as sex pheromones, during mate search. Both sexes are also attracted to the odor of the host fire ant. And mating occurs while the females are looking for suitable hosts. Females will track the movement and the behavior of the fire ant hosts while males will hover and spin around in the air looking for females. After locating one, the male will grab onto the female, and copulation takes less than a second. During this process, neither sex is able to keep flying, causing both to drop to the ground. Both the males and females of P. tricuspis will mate several times. The female P. tricuspis may produce from 100 to 300 eggs during its short mating time, but will only insert a single egg into each worker ant. = Sexual Dimorphism = The species has sexual dimorphism, with the females being much larger than the males. This is likely occurs because of the females being aggressive and fighting with other females over depositing their own eggs within a host. The females fight over the larger host ants to deposit their eggs in as these eggs will have a larger chance of survival. Larger females will most likely win these fights, leading to females growing larger than males. = Sex ratio = The species typically has a sex ratio that is biased towards males (usually in a 2:1 ratio). This is attributed to the relative size of the host ants, which happen to have more large individuals than smaller individuals. There is a lower number of hosts that can support the development of female flies, making the female gender rarer. This creates intraspecific competition between the P. tricuspis females who compete with each other in trying to oviposit within the same host. The females exhibit aggressive and territorial behavior.  Attack  The fly participates in attacking behavior of the Solenopsis invicta fire ant when attempting to oviposit. The adult female flies will hover around 3 to 5mm above their chosen host ant and orient their ovipositor towards the host. They will then quickly dive in and inject the egg into the thorax of the worker host. The fly will avoid attempting to oviposit in the alates of the colony and will instead exclusively attack worker ants. Successful egg deposition only occurs around 8-35% of the time.  Activity  The daily activity of the P. tricuspis fly starts very low in the early morning, increases gradually, then peaks at midday. Maximum male emergence has been seen to occur around one hour before maximum female emergence. In terms of seasonal activity, the fly population is seen throughout the year, but are highest in the fall and summer and lowest in the winter and spring. This correlates to a density dependent response to the availability of the fire ant host, which is greater in the fall due to the frequent rainfall.  Biological control  P. tricuspis was the first species of Pseudacteon fly successfully used as a biological control agent for imported red fire ant in the US. Imported red fire ant Solenopsis invicta was accidentally introduced into the United States in Alabama in the 1930s. Since then, its populated area has expanded across the country, including California. The ants are extremely detrimental to the environment of the United States, costing around a billion dollars every year in damage and impacting native fauna and habitats. While chemical pesticides have been tested as a way of controlling the ants, the solution is not environmentally or costly sustainable. Between the summer of 1997 and fall of 1999, the P. tricuspis fly was released in eight different sites over the mounds of the fire ant located throughout North Florida as a self-sustained way of controlling the fire ant, with six of these sites having a survival population after the first winter. Over the years, the population of P. tricuspis fly at these sites continued to grow and expanded beyond the area of the release sites, and in the fall of 2000 the sites fused into one large occupied area. The purpose of the P. tricuspis fly was to stress the fire ant population in order to shift the balance back in favor of the native ants in America. While the exact impact of the fly on the fire ant population is unknown, the fire ant has evolved to develop specific defense mechanisms against the fly, indicating that there is some sort of large population wide significance on the survival of the fire ant colonies. Additionally, in the presence and attack of the P. tricuspis, the fire ant will typically decline its foraging and resource retrieval rates significantly, by almost 84%.

At the time, Scotland was part of proto-North American continent Laurentia. The orogeny overlapped with the Caledonian orogeny and the orogenies that formed the Appalachian Mountains. It was the only orogeny in Laurenta at that time which resulted in deformation, folding and metamorphism. The Fleur de Lys rocks in Newfoundland may have been affected by the Grampian orogeny as well. Sequence of the Grampian orogeny In the Cambrian and early Ordovician, shallow water carbonates and deep water turbidite basins, which formed the Southern Highland Group, dominated the section of the Laurentian coast that would be later separate to form Scotland. The Grampian orogeny stopped sedimentation. The discovery of volcanic arc rocks in western Ireland indicated a possible island arc collision with a subduction zone during the closure of the Iapetus Ocean to form Pangea. Some proposals in 1983 and 1984 suggested that the arc is buried under younger sediments in Scotland's Midland Valley. During the collision at the edge of the Laurentian continent, an ophiolite nappe was overthrusted, possibly preserved in Unst, in the Shetland Islands. Other ophiolite zones at the Highland Border and Ballantrae may be from the same event. The Grampian orogeny took place at close to the same time as the Taconic orogeny. In both cases, more extensive ophiolite nappes may have eroded away. The Grampian orogeny deformed the rocks of the Grampian Terrane and the Dalradian Supergroup. Fold traces extend for hundreds of kilometers, with a complex formation of nappes and fold stacks.

It was discovered by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830. It resembles a small flying ant. The fly is most commonly found inhabiting cow dung. Sepsis thoracica shows positive directional selection in body size that corresponds with negative selection of melanism. In addition, body size and coloration are coupled via gene regulation. A hypothesized mechanism is through the enzyme phenoloxidase. Description Sepsis thoracica is a relatively small fly (often described as ant-like), averaging 5 mm in length and 0.75 mm in width. They have a rounded head with compound eyes. The last segment of the body contains short, silver hair. Their wings are mostly transparent with dark spots towards the ends. The developmental temperature influences their body size, in accordance with the temperature-size rule. Females are completely black and smaller than males. =Male polymorphism= Males can be either black or amber, a coloration that is usually only observed in more tropical species. S. thoracica is the only fly of the genus Sepsis to exhibit this male polymorphism in relation to size. While males can be a spectrum of colors between black and amber, most are usually one of the extremes. Thermal radiation, which is the long-waves emitted by the atmosphere, is important in the development of S. thoracica because the Distribution Sepsis thoracia has a wide distribution. It is mainly found in Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom, extending as far north as Denmark and southern Sweden. It is also in Afrotropical and Australasian regions. It has most recently been found in Vietnam and South Korea. It is mostly dispersed near the coasts and at high elevations in mountain ranges. Habitat Cow Dung Sepsis thoracia is a dung fly and prefers cow dung and buffalo dung, especially in human-managed agricultural grasslands. However, the flies typically avoid horse dung. They are a tropical and subtropical species that are extremely heliophilic, or attracted to sun. They are most active between the months of July and October. Life history Females deposit their eggs into the dung. The larvae are not able to escape this during development and thus the flies only leave when they are adults. The larvae are amphipneustic, meaning that both their first and last spiracles are functional. The two spiracle pairs of the respiratory system are on the prothorax and the posterior of the abdomen. The developmental time of the larvae is four days and five hours, optimally at a temperature of 26-28 ¬∞C. In cow dung, 15-22 days marks the total developmental time. These flies enter dormancy in response to dropping temperatures. Food resources Sc. stercoraria They spend a considerable amount of their life foraging for nectar and their insect prey, Sc. stercoraria. They feed on dung for protein and nectar for carbohydrates. While they are found to mostly feed on cow dung, they have been shown to feed on horse dung if it is available in their area. The competitor density they face largely depends on the amount of eggs laid in the dung pat from which they emerged. They don‚Äôt face much outside species competition. Mating =Sexual selection= Sepsis thoracica has shown a strong, positive directional selection on body size that coincides with a strong negative selection of melanism. The dichotomous coloration is thought to have evolved as a way to indicate their size and fitness. The purity of amber color relating to size was most likely maintained due to the cost it retains from reduced immunity. This causes a trait threshold, where only the largest individuals in a competitive environment can afford to be amber. The larger, amber-colored males are favored by females over the small, black males. However, black males have greater success than mid-sized, mid-toned males. Mating practices do not differ between males of different colors, but reproductive fitness is higher in the larger, amber males, =Copulation= Sepsis thoracica does not exhibit any pre or post-copulatory guarding in Europe, but it does have pre-copulatory guarding in more tropical areas, such as Zimbabwe. This mating behavior occurred on the dung pat, with males scrambling and competing for the exceedingly rare single females. Male rejection and struggle behavior does occur. When a mate is found, copulations take place in the nearby vegetation. S. thoracica has relatively long copulation and guarding durations, similar to S. cynipsea. Enemies Sepsis thoracica faces mostly generalist predators in their pastoral habitat. Vertebrates include birds, Lacerta lizards, and amphibians when close enough to ponds. The main predators are terrestrial invertebrates, like spiders and insects, primarily other flies and wasps. When dealing with vertebrate predators, black S. thoracica have a greater advantage over amber-colored flies. When encountering an invertebrate predator, being larger is more advantageous than being black. Since S. thoracica is most likely to encounter an invertebrate predator, size is the best defense mechanism for S. thoracica. Genetics Body size and coloration are coupled together, likely via gene regulation. They have been shown to be functionally linked through the enzyme phenoloxidase, which works in the phenoloxidase system. This system is the main immunological defense system of S. thoracica. The reduction in melanin conforms with lower amounts of phenoloxidase, which compromises the immune system. This causes larger, amber individuals to be immunocompromised. This polymorphism is seen in related species such as Saltella sphondylii, implying a more general evolutionary relevance. Physiology =Thermal radiation= Thermal radiation, which is the long-waves emitted by the atmosphere, is important in the development of S. thoracica because the dung on which the flies eat absorbs most of the short-wave radiation from the sun because of its dark color. This causes the dung to emit long-wave radiation which is absorbed by the flies. The amount of long-wave absorbance does not differ based on the amount of melanism because it‚Äôs out of melanin‚Äôs spectrum; consequently, absorption relies only on size. Larger individuals thus absorb the most radiation but also have a lower heat-exchange rate with the environment due to its low surface volume ratio. Larger flies retain more heat and are more prone to overheating. This can be compensated by lower melanism, which absorbs the short-wave radiation. The reduction in short-wave radiation can negate the effects of the long-wave radiation, allowing both amber and black colored S. thoracica to have relatively similar temperatures. =UV radiation= Protection from UV radiation is also exploited by the dichotomous nature of the males. Black flies have a high amount of melanin, which they use to directly protect itself from UV damage. Amber flies invest in their cuticle, which becomes thicker with increased size. Thus, beyond a threshold, UV radiation will have little to no penetrance. This is an importance defense mechanism since UV radiation can lead to unwanted genetic mutations.

The yellowish soil imparts its color to the Yellow River and Yellow Sea downstream. The ecoregion is located west of the lower Yellow River basin and the North China Plain.  Location and description  The ecoregion runs about 1,600 km from southwest to northeast, and is about 300 km wide. The loess soil is up to 200 meters thick, with the greatest depths in the southwest, where consolidated loess can be formed into mountains. Thinner deposits are in the northeast where the loess only fills basins. Because loess retains nutrients and water well, the soil can support vegetation through dry seasons.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dwb)), with a dry winter. This climate is characterized by large seasonal temperature differentials and a warm summer (at least four months averaging over , but no month averaging over , and cold winters having monthly precipitation less than one-tenth of the wettest summer month.  Flora and fauna  The plateau supports mixed deciduous broadleaf forests in the northern and eastern areas, although vegetation gets more sparse and poor towards the southwest. Conversion of forest to agriculture over time has led to erosion and loss of vegetation, which has been severe in some areas. The general belief is that the area was once heavily forested with tall trees, however recent research suggests that much of the area may have been grassland at times in the past 20,000 years. A canyon formed in the soft loess soil, Linxia County Since the 1950s the government has heavily supported tree- planting programs for erosion control in the region, converting unproductive agricultural land on steep slopes to forest.

It was described by A. H. Haliday in 1838. Their appearance differs greatly from that of other Coelopa flies. C. pilipes are especially prevalent in European beaches. Year-round, these flies live in washed-up kelp on wrack zones of beaches before adulthood and consume the decaying kelp, mostly of the genera Laminaria and Fucus that have a great impact on the flies' survival. Female flies lay eggs in the decaying seaweed, and larvae mature in the warm, moist environment it provides. C. pilipes has significant sympatry with C. frigida; the two flies are often studied together due to their overlapping habitats and distribution.  Morphology  Anthomiidae and Coelopa pilipes (darker in color) In general, seaweed flies are dark-colored, small or medium-sized flies with hairs or bristles. Darker color makes the adults more distinguishable from other species, but larvae are less easily identified. Adults have small eyes and short antennae and legs, and their bodies tend to be more flattened than other species. Environment, genetic factors, and nutrition contribute to variable measurements such as wing size.Mathis, Wayne Neilsen and McAlpine, D. K. 2011. \\"A catalog and conspectus on the family Coelopidae (Diptera: Schizophora).\\" Myia. 12:171‚Äì205. In order to adapt to wet seaside environments, C. pilipes larvae have hair on their posterior parts and spines on their ventral surfaces, as seen in many species that dwell in damp seaweed. Coelopa pilipes are phylogenetically distant from other species in the Coelopa genus and thus display certain behaviors that differ from other Coelopa flies.  Distribution  Coelopa pilipes can be found in European countries with shorelines, such as Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, and Poland. Other reported locations for C. pilipes residence include North Africa and Australia, where it is not native.  Sympatry  In Britain, C. pilipes populations are always mixed with C. frigida, from adult to larval stages, in varying ratios. These numbers can depend on the season, as is found in northeastern populations in England. Number of nearby C. pilipes has been observed to affect the population size of sister species C. frigida, and vice versa. C. pilipes emergence can be greatly affected by the presence of C. frigida, including prolonged development and emergence times. They are generally more numerous than C. frigida in the summer months. On average, C. pilipes takes four more days than C. frigida in order to emerge from pupation as an adult.  Habitat  On beaches, C. pilipes is able to thrive within decaying seaweed, which provides a relatively warm and humid environment throughout the year. Piles of seaweed on beaches are especially common after storms and high tides in the spring, both of which are becoming more severe with climate change. Even when the beach is covered in snow and ice, decay of the seaweed can generate temperatures of in the inner layers of seaweed where Coelopa larvae live.  Life history  During the summer, populations of C. pilipes decrease in number. They are most abundant in the fall and winter, when seaweed is most likely to be washed on the beach. All larval instars remain in the seaweed, and larval aggregations tend to not be mixed in species. If seaweed is washed back to sea, the larval population can decrease significantly with the loss of the seaweed habitat. Pupation begins in drier portions of seaweed, and the development time for C. pilipes is significantly longer than that of other Coelopa species such as C. frigida. Adult Coelopa flies are estimated to live around 2‚Äì4 weeks, with some variation.  Food resources  Fucus serratus Larvae of C. pilipes feed on the same decomposing seaweed their eggs are deposited on. They may also consume bacteria found on the surface of the seaweed. If only raised on Laminaria seaweed, the flies have reduced growth due to a lower nutritious value of seaweed. The Fucus seaweed that the flies prefer most is prevalent in the North Pacific. The presence of Fucus can be associated with the number of C. pilipes flies at a certain site.  Mating  Unlike flies that mate seasonally, C. pilipes is able to mate throughout the year, even during the winter, due to the constant environment of rotting seaweed on beaches. Adults are found to require both Fucus and Laminaria genera of seaweed in order to breed, and the presence of seaweed induces oviposition. = Male‚Äìfemale interaction = Fucus kelp has been observed to increase male harassment of females in addition to duration of copulation, showing the direct influence of environment on mating. Harassment rates are directly related to mating struggles. C. pilipes males increase harassment levels with more prolonged exposure to the seaweed. Unlike other species, female C. pilipes have been shown to attempt rejection of males based on body size by performing abdominal bends. Willingness to mate can also be affected by the available seaweed types. Females may shake and kick to reject males; however, female resistance reduces as male harassment increases due to increased costs of resisting.  Parental care  Adult C. pilipes lay their eggs after seaweed is deposited on the beach, during which initial decay creates a warmer environment on the seaweed. Larvae feed on the seaweed, promoting more decay, which attracts more females to lay their eggs. Females lay eggs singly within the decaying kelp. As a result, larvae are aggregated less densely than other species. Without Fucus seaweed, females are less likely to lay eggs.  Parasites  Coelopa pilipes flies are prone to parasitism by the mite Thinoseius fucicola, with males being more susceptible.  Genetics  Coelopa pilipes has 6 total chromosome pairs. 5 have median centromeres, and the remaining one is a dot-shaped pair. The shape of the chromosomes is relatively uniform. Heterochromatin is scattered throughout the chromosomes of C. pilipes flies, and the localization of sex-controlling genes is unknown, as there is no clear sexual dimorphism.  Environmental physiology  Exposure to certain seaweed such as Fucus has been shown to increase mortality of some kelp fly species; however, virgin C. pilipes are able to delay this effect.  Industrial use  Because C. pilipes has been successfully reared in the laboratory and contain significantly higher omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, larvae have been studied for potential animal consumption as feed.

An emerging intelligence fostered by human interaction with Information Technology, it has been suggested that recognition of this intelligence will expand the scope of teaching and learning in the 21st century and all aspects of one's personal and professional lives. The term is also used in businesses to refer to the information obtained through technologies and making use of them as an online marketing strategy and intelligence in the context of cyber security such as that mapped out by Global Commission on Internet Governance. Digital intelligence in this article refers to a new type of intelligence as a human capacity that combines knowledge, ways of knowing and the ability to interact effectively in a cultural or community setting.  Definition  Digital Intelligence or Digital Intelligence Quotient (DQ) has been defined as ‚Äúa comprehensive set of technical, cognitive, meta-cognitive, and socio-emotional competencies that are grounded in universal moral values and that enable individuals to face the challenges and harness the opportunities of digital life‚Äù by DQ Institute. DQ does not merely refer to the skills needed to use technology more effectively or being aware of potential dangers for children who are constantly online. According to DQ Institute, DQ is all-encompassing in that it covers all areas of individuals‚Äô digital life that ranges from personal and social identities of individuals to their use of technology, their practical, operational and technical capabilities critical for daily digital lives and careers and the potential safety and security issues in this digital age. DQ is important in today's world as everything is technologically driven; if we do not develop a certain level of digital intelligence, we will be precluded from an increasingly digital world. As such, it is said to be essential to develop digital intelligence from an early age. DQ is also viewed to be measureable and highly learnable. Framework Rather than being defined as the commonly accepted form of intelligence, DQ could be understood more in line with the multiple intelligences theory by Gardner; it might be akin to a ‚Äúmeta-intelligence ‚Äì one that is composed of many constituent intelligences‚Äù. In the same way that Intelligence quotient (IQ) and Emotional intelligence (EQ) measure general and emotional intelligences, Digital Intelligence Quotient (DQ) can be further deconstructed into eight key areas: Digital identity, Digital rights, Digital literacy, Digital use, Digital communication, Digital safety, Digital emotional intelligence, Digital security. Given that ‚Äúrespect‚Äù is a fundamental moral principle of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the guiding principles of an individual's digital life within the eight DQ areas are respect for: oneself, time and the environment, life, property, others, reputation and relationships, knowledge and rights. Within these eight areas, there are three levels of maturity: *Level 1 - Digital Citizenship: the ability to use digital technology in safe, responsible and ethical ways. *Level 2 - Digital Creativity: the ability to become part of the digital ecosystem and to create new knowledge, technologies and content to turn ideas into reality. *Level 3 - Digital Competitiveness: the ability to solve global challenges, and to create new opportunities in the digital economy by driving entrepreneurship, jobs, growth and impact. As such, there are 24 digital competencies consisting of various knowledge, skills, attitudes and values. In addition, DQ further suggests there are eight key digital citizenship competencies for children. They are Digital Citizen Identity, Screen Time Management, Digital Footprint Management, Cyber Bullying Management, Digital Empathy, Privacy Management, Critical Thinking, Cyber Security Management. It has been suggested that young learners need to be armed with these competencies, rooted in universal moral values, in order to be good digital citizens and ‚Äúhelp them make informed choices and navigate the digital world safely‚Äù. The efficacy of the DQ Digital Citizenship framework was researched and developed through the development of DQworld.net, a digital media platform that aims to teach and assess children on digital citizenship, moral character and critical thinking and was awarded two UNESCO prizes. The DQ framework was developed by DQ Institute and has been agreed upon by OECD Education 2030 and IEEE Standards Association as a benchmark for global alignment in September 2018. The DQ framework is said to encompass the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values needed by individuals to thrive successfully in this digital world and be confident in meeting the challenges and demands of the digital era, and is the aggregation from 25 leading global frameworks. It is also built on the OECD's Education 2030 Learning Framework to create a guide for nations to develop their national education and policies on digital intelligence and is adaptable as the technological world evolves. Apart from this, there is currently no other structural model of DQ based on the definition of DQ as a human capability. So far, only the citizenship level test, known as DQWorld.net, has been developed. While DQ may be criticized, in terms of it not really being any intelligence, the DQ framework ‚Äòreflects very well the areas that can be reliably claimed to find their reflection in school curricula‚Äô, which includes areas essential for present and future life. History Digital Intelligence Quotient (DQ) was first coined and its framework created in 2016 by Dr Yuhyun Park. It was developed through an academically rigorous process by the research team based at various universities including Nanyang Technological University, the National Institute of Education in Singapore, Iowa State University and many others. The concept and structure was published by the World Economic Forum in 2016 and since then, the DQ framework has been widely used by organizations from a myriad of industries locally and internationally. International recognition = Coalition for Digital Intelligence (CDI) = In September 2018, the Coalition for Digital Intelligence (CDI) ‚Äì formed by IEEE Standards Association, the DQ Institute and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) ‚Äì institutionalized the DQ framework by DQ Institute as a global framework for digital intelligence which includes a common set of definitions, language, and understanding of comprehensive digital literacy and skills that can be adopted by nations worldwide. =DQ Day= In the effort to coordinate worldwide efforts in setting global standards for DQ, the inaugural DQ Day was launched on 10 October 2019 by DQ Institute and IEEE SA. According to Dr Yuhyun Park, setting global standards for digital intelligence ‚Äòis to ensure that everyone around the world, starting with our children, has equal opportunity to thrive in this digital age' IEEE SA adds, ‚Äòa global standard that sets common indicators for more comprehensively and collectively understanding the existing challenges that digital skill-promoting efforts face and a common language is foundational to ensuring that digital literacy and competency efforts are coordinated globally and moving the right direction =IEEE process= The DQ framework was identified as the best practice to be used as a global industry standard for digital skills by the IEEE Digital Literacy Industry Connections program and there is an initiation of preliminary work under IEEE SA to develop an IEEE global standard for Digital Literacy, Skills and Readiness using the DQ framework. Adoption and implementation =DQ Group story= The DQ Institute was born through a project named Shaping Future Implications of Digital Media for Society in association with the World Economic Forum, having identified the need for improved digital media literacy or ‚Äúdigital intelligence (DQ)‚Äù across various demographics and more critically in youth. The Institute is a multi-stakeholder consortium of organizations focused on increasing DQ in youth around the world and has been the driving force in launching the Coalition for Digital Intelligence (CDI). This community-led initiative is tasked with evangelizing the institute's DQ framework across the public Education and private ICT sectors as the single framework of reference, which is to be used as (i) a common source of definitions around digital skills and literacy, and (ii) a capacity building and DQ measurement platform. The programs based on the DQ framework are poised to be rolled out by DQ Institute to more than 100 countries by 2020. The primary target will be schools and education ministries in countries experiencing rapid digital transformations. The goal is to help governments understand the level of digital citizenship among students and teachers and to help them develop their own DQ curriculum within three years. The DQ Institute has joined forces with some big organizations, including Google, Twitter and the United Nations children's charity UNICEF, and it has received government funding from Singapore and Mexico. =DQ Every Child= DQ Every Child (#DQEveryChild) is a global digital citizenship movement seeking to empower ‚Äòevery‚Äô child worldwide with DQ digital citizenship. It makes use of an online gamified platform to educate and assess children with digital citizenship skills based on the DQ framework. #DQEveryChild was created as a research-based social initiative developed in Singapore through a multi-stakeholder collaboration including Nanyang Technological University, Singtel, the Singapore government, and infollutionZERO in Korea. It has since transformed into a global movement ‚Äì run by the DQ Institute ‚Äì an international coalition formed through the World Economic Forum Since then, #DQEveryChild reached numerous countries such as Korea through the support of UNICEF, Nigeria through World Economic Forum, Turkey through Turkcell, Singapore through the Ministry of Education and Singtel, Mexico through the Ministry of Public Education, India and others. As of 2019, the #DQEveryChild initiative has reached more than 700,000 children in 107 countries and has been translated into 21 languages. =DQ Global Standards= Based on the DQ framework, the DQ Global Standards Report 2019 was launched on 22 March 2019 at the seventh annual Global Education and Skills Forum (GESF). The report was spearheaded by Dr Yuhyun Park and co- authored by Professor Douglas Gentile of Iowa State University. It is the world's first attempt to define a global standard for digital literacy, skills and readiness across the education and technology sectors and establish a global, common language and set of norms around the digital competencies. The OECD, the Forum, the World Bank, and the United Nations have all identified these digital competencies in the DQ framework as fundamental for future readiness. The DQ Global Standards is the culmination of the successful collaboration across global public, private, and civic education and technology communities that began with the launch of the CDI at the Sustainable Impact Summit, the World Economic Forum in September 2019. Criticisms There are concerns over complacency in that if a child is noted to have high DQ, it might be treated as a substitute for parental control Whitney DeCamp, a sociologist at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, suggests that ‚Äúthe DQ categories are too broad, so less-risky behaviours are lumped into the same category as more-harmful ones.

Early life and education Gunter was born and raised in Sivells Bend, Texas. She was the first of two daughters born to parents Addison Yancey Gunter and Elizabeth Ligon. Gunter was sent away at age 12 to St. Louis, Missouri before attending Virginia Wesleyan Institute. After receiving an education, Gunter moved to Gainesville, Texas where her father had his plantation and, whereon his death she assumed possession of the establishment from 1892 to 1902. While managing the plantation, she decided the state needed a system of county libraries. Gunter traveled to New York to study at the New York Library School where she completed a course on the California State Library System. Career Upon moving back to Gainesville, Gunter was essential to the creation of a small subscription library with the XLI Club. By 1908, the library was receiving funds from the municipal government, though Gunter led the designing of the building. Once Andrew Carnegie gave his grant to the city, Gunter and her fellow club members raised the funds to buy a site for construction of the Gainesville Public Library. Pictured are three library staff inside the Gainesville Carnegie Public Library. Though she began work in 1908, Gunter became the first head librarian of the Gainesville Carnegie Public Library upon its completion in 1914. She sat as treasurer of the Texas Library Association from 1914 to 1915. On October 14, 1915, she was elected chairman of the legislative committee. Amongst her many lobbying activities, she also fought for library access for African-Americans, which failed to prosper. Gunter also participated in the Suffragette movement to earn women the right to vote. Gunter eventually founded and directed the Cooke County Library in 1920 and directed. Five years later, Gunter became a charter member of the Red River Valley Historical Association. While handling librarian duties, Gunter began to construct a law that would bring library services to rural Texas. Along with county representative George W. Dayton, Gunter worked on the Texas County Library Law which passed on March 5, 1917 and was signed by Governor of Texas James E. Ferguson. Though the first county library law would later be repealed, Gunter pushed for a second library law after getting advice from the California State Library. The new law ‚Äì the 1919 Texas County Library Law ‚Äì passed and signed by Governor of Texas William P. Hobby. Gunter died on October 10, 1926.

Garnier was educated for the law, and obtained when young the office of procureur to the Ch√¢telet in Paris. On the calling of the states-general he was elected as one of the d√©put√©s suppl√©ants of the city of Paris, and in 1791 administrator of the department of Paris. After the 10th of August 1792 he withdrew to the Pays de Vaud, and did not return to France till 1795. In public life, however, he seems to have been singularly fortunate. In 1797 he was on the list of candidates for the Directory; in 1800 he was prefect of Seine-et-Oise; and in 1804 he was made senator and in 1808 a count. After the Restoration he obtained a peerage, and on the return of Louis XVIII, after the Hundred Days, he became minister of state and member of privy council, and in 1817 was created a marquis. He died at Paris on the 4th of October 1821. At court he was, when young, noted for his facile power of writing society verse, but his literary reputation depends rather on his later works on political economy, especially his translation, with notes and introduction, of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations (1805) and his Histoire de la monnaie (2 vols., 1819). He also wrote Abr√©g√© des principes de l‚Äô√©con. polit. (1796). The Description g√©ographique, physique, et politique du d√©partement de Seine-et-Oise (1802) was drawn up from his instructions.

Darius the king of Persia issued a decree supporting the temple building project. =Verse 1= :Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon. KJV *\\"House of the rolls\\": or \\"house of the scrolls\\"Notes [a] on Ezra 6:1 in NKJV =Verse 2= :And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written: KJV *\\"Achmetha\\": probably \\"Ecbatana\\", the ancient capital of Media.Notes [a] on Ezra 6:2 in NKJV The discovery of the Aramaic version of the edict in this city is consistent with a non-biblical information that Cyrus regularly spent the summer period in this city,Xenophon noted that Cyrus wintered in Babylon, spent the spring in Susa, and summered in Ecbatana (Cyropaedia 8.6.22), apud Smith-Christopher 2007, p. 315 where he first rose to power (while also staying in other majestic capitals: Babylon and Susa in Elam (cf. ) in each other season of the year), including during the 'first summer of his reign over the whole Empire' (538 BC). =Verse 3= :In the first year of King Cyrus, King Cyrus issued a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem: ‚ÄúLet the house be rebuilt, the place where they offered sacrifices; and let the foundations of it be firmly laid, its height sixty cubits and its width sixty cubits, NKJV *\\"Sixty cubits\\": about 90 feet, or 27 meters.Notes [a] on Ezra 6:3 in MEV A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man's arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters.Notes [a] on Ezra 6:3 in WEB The dimension here could refer to the measurement for Solomon's Temple in . The Aramaic memorandum of the decree (parallel to Ezra 1:2-4) provides evidence that Cyrus's edict is real and it may span to a number of different documents according to their functions, such as the edict in verses 2b-5, which could be the treasury record to certify that the vessels from the temple in Jerusalem have been returned to the Jews, as it contains extra information compared to the version of the decree in chapter 1. The measurement of the temple (verse 3) and the directions about the manner of the building (verse 4) may be designed \\"to set limits to royal expenditure of the project\\". =Verse 8= :Moreover I issue a decree as to what you shall do for the elders of these Jews, for the building of this house of God: Let the cost be paid at the king‚Äôs expense from taxes on the region beyond the River; this is to be given immediately to these men, so that they are not hindered. NKJV *\\"House\\": refers to \\"Temple\\".Notes [a] on Ezra 6:8 in NKJV The reply letter of Darius to Tattenai opens with the cited words of Cyrus, but immediately follows with his own decree, confirming entirely the measures of his predecessor and reapply them to the new situation. =Verse 13= :Then Tattenai, governor of the region beyond the River, Shethar-Boznai, and their companions diligently did according to what King Darius had sent. NKJV *\\"Tattenai, the governor beyond the River\\": that is, \\"Persian governor of the province west of the Euphrates River‚Äù (Hebrews: eber nƒÅri; Aramaic: , -; \\"across or beyond the river\\"Hebrew Text Analysis: Ezra 6:13. Biblehub) during the reign of Darius I\\" (522‚Äì486 BCE). A number of cuneiform tablets bearing the name Tattenai have survived as part of what may have been a family archive, with one tablet functioning as a promissory note bearing a witness to the transaction involving a servant of \\"Tattannu, governor of Across-the- River\\". The clay tablet can be dated accurately to June 5, 502 BCE (the 20th year of Darius I).Mykytiuk, Lawrence, \\"Archaeology Confirms 3 More Bible People\\", Biblical Archaeology Review (Washington)43.3 (May/June 2017): 48. *\\"Diligently\\": or \\"with all diligence\\", is translated from the term osparna in the sense of \\"exactly, perfectly\\" as in the language of obedience, which can also rendered 'without delay', 'in full', 'with all diligence', giving a clear message that 'a powerful authority has spoken' (; 6:8, , 13; , , ; cf ; ; ). Completion and dedication of the Temple (6:13‚Äì18) Following the command of God and the decrees issued by Cyrus, Darius and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia, the Jews worked diligently, so the Temple was finally completed and the people could celebrate the dedication of it. =Verse 14= :So the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the command of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. NKJV *\\"Command\\" (KJV: \\"commandment\\"): or \\"Decree\\".Notes [a] on Ezra 6:14 in NKJV The prophecies of Haggai and Zechariah are recorded in the Hebrew Bible under the name of the Book of Haggai and Book of Zechariah, respectively. Haggai's prophecy period completely covers the time mentioned here (Ezra 4:24; 520 BC), whereas Zechariah's only partly. =Verse 15= :And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king. KJV The date corresponds to February 21, 515 B.C.Jamieson, Robert; Fausset, Andrew Robert; Brown, David. Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown's Commentary On the Whole Bible, \\"Ezra 6\\". 1871. Haggai (Haggai 1:15) writes that the building project was recommenced on the 24th day of the month Elul (the 6th month; September) in the second year of Darius (September 21, 520 BCThe Nelson Study Bible. Thomas Nelson, Inc. 1997. . pp. 1514-5.), so it took nearly 4¬Ω years to finish, although the foundations had been laid some twenty years earlier (April 536 BC; cf. ).Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges. Ezra 6. Accessed 28 April 2019. Therefore,it was completed around 70 years after its destruction in 587‚Äì586, close to Jeremiah's prediction. =Verse 18= :And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses. KJV This verse refers to ‚Äòthe organization of the priests and Levites described in ‚Äô, which distributes the service of the Temple by periods, of a week each, among the courses and divisions of priests and Levites (cf. ; ). Celebrating Passover (6:19‚Äì22) In keeping with the law of Moses, Passover is celebrated following the dedication of the temple, and this marks the ‚Äòrenewal of religious life‚Äô of the people. =Verse 19= :And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month. KJV The Hebrew language resumes in verse 19 and continues through .Notes [a] on Ezra 6:19 in NKJV The Passover on the 14th of the first month (Nisan) was commanded in , but since then only few celebrations are recorded in Hebrew Bible, as follows: * (1) under Moses on the second year after the Exodus () * (2) under Joshua at Gilgal after the circumcision of the people () * (3) in the reign of Hezekiah, after the purification of the Temple (ff.) * (4) in the reign of Josiah, after the religious reformation (; ) * (5) under Zerubbabel and Jeshua (Ezra 6). The celebration of the Passover on each of these occasions marks ‚Äúa new or a restored order of worship, and the solemn rededication by the people of their Covenant relation with God‚Äù.

He is a distinguished professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and was the executive editor of Rheologica Acta from 1989 to 2016, where he has served as honorary editor since 2017. Winter's research focuses on the measurement and modelling of soft matter rheology. He has given special attention to gelation, glass transition and flow-induced structure in polymers. Winter and his group developed highly-specific experimental methods, as well as analysis tools and visualization methods to support this research. In 1996, Winter was awarded the Bingham Medal in recognition of his contributions to experimental rheology, as well as rheometry of gels and polymer melts. He was also chosen for the National Science Foundation Creativity Award in 1997 and the Alexander von Humboldt Senior Scientist Award in 1999, during which he was a visiting professor at the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces in Potsdam. Winter is furthermore the co-founder of IRIS Development and founder of 2D Matter. Winter lives with his wife Karin. They have four children.  Early life and education  Winter was born in Stuttgart, Germany in 1941. He obtained a Dipl-Ing. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Stuttgart in 1967. He then received an M.S. from Stanford University in Chemical Engineering in 1968. He returned to University of Stuttgart where he completed his Ph.D. in 1973 in Polymer Rheology, an interest he continued pursuing immediately after graduation through work as a DFG (German Research Foundation) fellow at the Rheology Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In 1976, this led to a habilitation thesis on viscous dissipation in polymer flow.  Career  Winter began his teaching career as Privatdozent for Rheology at University of Stuttgart in 1976. He transferred as associate professor to the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1979, becoming full professor in 1984, and was named distinguished professor in 1994. At the same time, he also became the director of the Laboratory for Experimental Rheology. He was the executive editor of Rheologica Acta from 1989 to 2016, served on the editorial board of Journal of Rheology from 1989 to 2005, and of Journal of Non-Newton Fluid Mechanics from 1989 to 2018. From 2009 to 2012, he served as director of the Fluid Dynamics Program at the National Science Foundation (NSF), after which he returned to UMass. In 2007, Winter founded IRIS Development LLC, a software service company in support of experimental rheology and rheology education. The company holds the 'Amherst Rheology Courses' and licenses IRIS RheoHub, a software tool used for research and teaching by academic researchers, and by industrial decision makers so that they can utilize rheology efficiently. A main feature of the software is the visualization of rheology results by a direct overlay of experimental data and predictions from rheology theory. Winter founded 2D Matter LLC in 2018. It promotes the engineering of two- dimensional materials such as clay, graphene, zeolite, as generated by the exfoliation of precursors with layered structure.  Research and work  In a series of papers, Winter and his co-worker Fancois Chambon characterized the time-evolving rheology of polymers during gelation. They discovered that the gel point is marked by power-law relaxation over a wide range of frequencies/time-scales. Depending on the type of gel, the scaling exponent may adopt a value between -1 and 0. This behavior makes it easy to uniquely identify the gel point during both chemical and physical gelation processes. The experimental findings initiated active development of theories for the rheology of gels in the physics community. The findings also had technological impact, supporting the commercial development of gels as adhesives, sealants, toners, and biological materials. The original paper continues to be the most cited publication ever in the Journal of Rheology. Winter and his co-worker Michael Baumg√§rtel wrote the parsimonious model, the first robust code to convert dynamic mechanical data into their relaxation time spectrum and, together with Alois Schausberger, they showed that linear, flexible polymers of uniform chain length relax in a self-similar relaxation time spectrum now known as the BSW spectrum. The BSW relation provides a convenient starting condition for exploring polymer systems of more diverse molecular architecture. For generating biaxial extension in small samples, Winter invented the technique of lubricated squeeze flow and studied it jointly with Christopher Macosko. This simple technique was the first one to provide reliable step-strain biaxial extension data which is important for accurate modeling of polymer processing operations such as film blowing and blow molding. Winter, along with Miriam Siebenb√ºrger and Matthias Ballauff, discovered rheological scaling laws that govern the glass transition. This discovery led to the development of a new criterion for distinguishing gels from soft glass.Winter, H. H. (2013) Glass transition as the rheological inverse of gelation. Macromolecules 46, 2425-2432 With Alessio Zaccone, they also developed rheological scaling laws for colloidal gels, which take into account the power-law growth kinetics in the colloidal self-assembly. Winter also contributed to the numerical modeling of polymer processing operations and his 1977 paper on viscous dissipation in flowing polymer systems is widely considered a classic in the area. Winter and his group have also worked on the efficient decomposition of solid particles into thin leaves. They have produced organo-clay sheets from clay, graphene from graphite, and 2-D zeolites from zeolite monolith particles.Sabnis, S., Tanna, V. A., Li, C., Zhu, J., Vattipalli, V., Nonnenmann,, S.

He is the head chef at the Overlook Hotel, who has the ability to use telepathic abilities he called \\"the shining\\". He comes across another young boy with this ability named Danny Torrance, and learns that the spirits of the Hotel have taken over Danny's father, Jack. Hallorann is portrayed by Scatman Crothers in Stanley Kubrick's iconic 1980 adaptation of the novel. He was later portrayed by Melvin Van Peebles in the 1997 miniseries adaptation, Arthur Woodley in the 2016 operatic adaptation and Carl Lumbly in the 2019 film Doctor Sleep, an adaptation of the 2013 novel of the same name. Novels =The Shining= Hallorann first appears in The Shining, where he is the head chef at the Overlook Hotel in Colorado. While packing away for Winter one day, Hallorann meets the new caretaker, Jack Torrance and his family: his wife, Wendy and son Danny. Hallorann discovers that Danny carries the same psychic abilities as him. He tells Danny that, when Hallorann was a child, he discovered that he and his grandmother could carry conversations with each other without even moving their lips. She called this telepathy \\"The Shining\\". Hallorann warns Danny that the Overlook can be dangerous, especially to those who carry \\"The Shining\\". Later, Hallorann is contacted by Danny, who reveals that his father had become influenced by Delbert Grady and the other spirits inhabiting the hotel. Hallorann returns to the hotel in an attempt to rescue Danny and Wendy from Jack, and the three of them escape together as the hotel explodes and kills Jack.https://books.google.com.au/books?id=OjqoJpnLYYwC&pg;=PA17&dq;=dick+hallorann&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwiL- eDRws_lAhVUcCsKHZ99C74Q6AEIOTAC#v=onepage&q;=dick%20hallorann&f;=false =It= Hallorann is mentioned in Stephen King's 1986 novel, It, as being the founder of The Black Spot. The Black Spot was a bar in Derry, Maine which catered towards African-American soldiers and veterans. The Black Spot was eventually burned down in an act of racial tension by a group titled \\"The Maine Legion of White Decency\\". Hallorann uses his Shining ability to find survivors and rescue them, one of them being Will Hanlon, who went on to become the father of Mike Hanlon, a central character in It. It is suggested that the arson of The Black Spot was initiated by Pennywise the Dancing Clown. Hallorann was at The Black Spot when it burnt down, and was able to rescue Will Hanlon, who would become the father of Mike Hanlon, one of the main protagonists from It. The Black Spot was also referenced in King's novel, Insomnia. =Doctor Sleep= In Stephen King's 2013 sequel, Doctor Sleep, which occurs after the events at The Overlook, Hallorann remains close with Wendy and Danny, and becomes something of a mentor to Danny. One night, Danny wakes up to use the restroom, only to encounter Lorraine Massey, one of the spirits from The Overlook, prompting Wendy to call Hallorann for help. Hallorann reveals that, as a child, he was mentally, physically and sexually abused by his granduncle, Andy. After Andy's death, Hallorann was haunted by his ghost, but his grandmother taught Hallorann how to lock away such ghosts in an imaginary \\"lockbox\\". Hallorann teaches Danny this technique. Years later, Danny (now going simply by \\"Dan\\") attempts to locate Hallorann for help protecting fellow \\"Shiner\\" Abra Stone from the True Knot Cult. Dan discovers that Hallorann had died in 1999, but he is still able to communicate with and advise Dan by briefly possessing the body of Eleanor Ouellette, a woman in the hospice where Dan works. Other media =The Shining (film)= Hallorann was portrayed by musician Scatman Crothers in Stanley Kubrick's 1980 adaptation The Shining. While the film departs from King's novel in many ways (much to King's chagrin), one of the most notable changes is Hallorann's death. In King's novel, Hallorann survives Torrance's rampage. However in the film, Hallorann arrives at The Overlook Hotel after sensing that Danny and Wendy are in danger. Hallorann is subsequently axed in the stomach by Torrance and left for dead, killing him. His dead body is then discovered by Wendy when The Overlook attempts to trick her. Before the role was cast, the original choice for the role of Hallorann was Slim Pickens, due to working with Kubrick on Dr. Strangelove. However, Pickens refused to work with Kubrick again after being annoyed with the director for his perfectionism during the filming of that project. The role eventually went to Crothers, who had stated that he had wanted to play the role of Hallorann before the film had even started production. The filming of The Shining and Kubrick's notorious reputation for repeating takes multiple times to get the perfect shot did not sit well with Crothers. During the scene where Hallorann explains The Shining ability to Danny Torrance for example, Crothers began to burst into tears after 148 takes to get the scene right. The shot of Hallorann in a state of shock and horror after being contacted by Danny while staying in Miami also took another 60 takes, which again proved strenuous to Crothers. =The Shining (miniseries)= In Stephen King's 1997 miniseries adaptation of the novel directed by Mick Garris, Stephen King's The Shining, King wanted more accuracy to the source material, due to his noted hatred of Kubrick's film adaptation. Hallorann is portrayed by Melvin Van Peebles in this interpretation, and is attacked by Torrance with a croquet mallet rather than an axe, and survives his encounter like in the novel. While the miniseries itself gained mixed to negative reviews, Van Peebles's performance as Hallorann was seen as one of the few points of critical acclaim in the miniseries.https://books.google.com.au/books?id=EpgZDgAAQBAJ&pg;=PA160&lpg;=PA160&dq;=melvin+van+peebles+dick+hallorann&source;=bl&ots;=Uuoc6IEVqJ&sig;=ACfU3U2MCGHYIMK1AeroFCh5-5m5y0kz0A&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwi0gv7o68_lAhUVA3IKHbpzAV4Q6AEwF3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q;=melvin%20van%20peebles%20dick%20hallorann&f;=false =The Shining (opera)= Hallorann appears in the operatic adaptation of King's novel portrayed by Arthur Woodley in a baritone part. In this adaptation, he is again attacked with a mallet by Torrance, but is left unconscious and remains in The Overlook Hotel when it explodes, causing him to suffer the same fate as his film counterpart. =Doctor Sleep (film)= Similarly to the novel, Hallorann's ghost instructs Dan to use Lockboxes to lock away the bad apparitions. Hallorann's spirit later appears again to instruct Dan to protect Abra. Possible Hallorann film Prior to the release of Doctor Sleep, Warner Bros. had enough confidence in the film that they hired Mike Flanagan to script a prequel focusing on the character, with the working title Hallorann. Following the disappointing box-office performance of Doctor Sleep, however, the future of the project is unclear.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-doctor-sleeps- dismal-14m-debut-terrifies-hollywood-1253734 Reception Hallorann's portrayal in the book, as well as the performance by Scatman Crothers have all been positively received by fans. While not as well acclaimed as Crothers's portrayal, Melvin Van Peebles's portrayal of Hallorann in the 1997 miniseries adaptation also received positive reviews. Hallorann's death in the film adaptation of The Shining is seen as being one of the first movies to start the trope of \\"The Black Guy Always Dies First In Horror Movies\\". This is a trope that recognises the fact that African-American or minority characters often don't survive horror movies, and are sometimes the first to be killed off. Despite being the first person killed in The Shining, Hallorann is also the only person (aside from Jack Torrance) to die during the film, and is the only on-screen death.Stephen King Films FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the King of Horror on Film Scott Von Doviak Hal Leonard Corporation, Feb 1, 2014 For his performance as Hallorann, Crothers won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1981, as well as Best Supporting Actor from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy or Horror for his portrayal.Official Saturn Awards websitehttps://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000004/1981 In The Simpsonss Treehouse of Horror parody of The Shining, dubbed \\"The Shinning\\", the role of Hallorann is filled by Groundskeeper Willie, who refers to the ability to \\"Shine\\" as \\"The Shinning\\". As in the film, Willie is axed by Homer Simpson, who fills in for the role of Jack Torrance. Hallorann is again parodied in the music video for \\"Spit It Out\\" by heavy metal band Slipknot.

She was the author of nine books, and the founding editor of the journal Soziale Reform. Along with more general advocacy of equality for women, social justice, and a radical and near-atheist approach to religion, her works \\"in a manner unique for her time repeatedly and brilliantly questioned the notion of 'natural' differences between the sexes\\". She has been called \\"Germany's most brilliant (and yet often misunderstood) feminist theorist of the 1840s\\". Louise-Dittmar Stra√üe, a road in Darmstadt-Eberstadt, was named for her in 2002. Life Dittmar was born on September 7, 1807, in Darmstadt. She was one of ten children of a treasury official for the Grand Duchy of Hesse, had no formal education, and was the only daughter to remain unmarried, in part because her father's salary could not extend to a dowry for her.

She began publishing her books anonymously in 1845, but after publishing four of them she revealed her identity in a public lecture in Mannheim in 1847. Her friends and correspondents in this period included Ludwig Bamberger, Karl Theodor Bayrhoffer, and Ludwig Feuerbach. With Feuerbach's encouragement, she founded the journal Soziale Reform in 1849. After losing her anonymity, she published an additional five books, including an omnibus edition of her four earlier books, two books of poetry, and one of collected essays from the journal. After the failure of the German revolutions of 1848‚Äì1849 and consequent suppression of liberal views, she left public life. Her brothers emigrated as Forty-Eighters, and her journal shut down after only four issues. She began living alone in 1850.

It opened in 1865. It was designed by Andrea Strombuco.  History  Faust, 1881 The Theatre Royal was located at 80 Elizabeth Street, Brisbane. It was the first official theatre in Brisbane, with its first version opening in 1865. The newly modelled Theatre Royal opened 18 April 1881. It was again remodelled in 1911 when electric lights were installed. In 1940 it was again renovated and the theatre was occupied by U.S. Army from 1942 to 1945. A small number of revues for American servicemen were offered during this time. It resumed its life as a theatre following the war. From 1949-1959, comedian George Wallace Junior presented weekly variety shows at the Theatre Royal. Early shows featured an all male, ex-army revue company called the Kangaroos. A ballet and showgirls were eventually added to the show to broaden its audience appeal. The female performers began to be called the ‚ÄúRoyal Showgirls‚Äù and were dressed in bikinis, mini-skirts and shorts. The shows were vaudeville or burlesque in style and featured titles which implied nudity. The shows attracted a wide cross section of the Brisbane population to what was described as the ‚ÄòBrisbane Folies Bergere‚Äô. Following the introduction of television to Brisbane in 1957, Wallace transferred his variety show to a TV format and attendance at the Theatre Royal shows began to decline. Nudity was promoted to improve audience numbers but by 1959 the theatre was compelled to close. The Queensland Symphony Orchestra and Queensland Theatre Company later used it. It was operated as a nightclub, Swizzles in the 1980‚Äôs before being demolished in 1987 to make way for the Myer Centre complex development in 1987.  Interior  The theatre could seat 1,350 people, with 350 in the dress circle, 250 in the stalls and 750 in the pit. It was designed by Andrea Strombuco who had also designed Her Majesty‚Äôs Theatre. It had a private refreshment room for the dress circle patrons and a smoking room.  Decoration  Its proscenium had gold Corinthian columns. The horse shoe shape of the dress circle obscured side views of the stage. After the 1911 refurbishment, the interior was marked by salmon pink, green and cream accents. Seating and ventilation was improved along with the installation of a sliding roof.  Legacy  Programs from the Theatre Royal are held in the State Library of Queensland and Queensland Performing Arts Centre Museum. Selected programs are also held in the University of Queensland Fryer Library.

He investigates how cells communicate with one another, with an emphasis on how the ubiquitous intracellular signalling messenger calcium controls biological functions such as secretion, energy production and gene expression. Parekh's research investigates how aberrant calcium signals can contribute to ill health in humans, including allergies and asthma. Using various cell model systems and human tissue, he studies the physiology, cell biology and biochemistry of store-operated calcium channel proteins. Opening of these channels leads to calcium entry into the cell from the blood, triggering important physiological responses. Too much or too little calcium entry can lead to disease and tissue damage which makes the Calcium release activated channels (CRAC) promising biological targets for drug discovery. =Awards and honours= Parekh was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2019. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

After fighting in Silesia and Lesser Poland, the Bohemian army advanced on Silesia and Lesser Poland in 1345, including on the Polish capital of Krak√≥w. An armistice signed later that year held until 1348, when hostilities resumed. Although Poland had a slight military advantage, the war ended with the Treaty of Namys≈Ç√≥w signed in November 1348. No territorial changes were made. The Poles renounced their claims to Silesia, and the Bohemians their claims to the Polish throne.  Background  Casimir the Great by Leopold L√∂ffler Kingdoms of Bohemia and Poland had fought over border territories before since at least 990; in 1327, John of Bohemia raided Silesia and Lesser Poland and reached the Polish capital of Krak√≥w. Silesia, in particular, divided into numerous Duchies of Silesia following the fragmentation of Poland, was a target for Bohemian expansion. Polish King Casimir the Great already had acknowledged Bohemian control of Silesia in the 1335 Treaty of Trentschin. However, neither Poland nor Bohemia was satisfied with the status quo, and every few years the border would shift due to diplomatic negotiations or small military escapades.  The war  Charles IV The immediate cause of the war was the imprisonment of Charles, son of John, by the Poles. While he was freed shortly afterwards, this gave the Bohemians a pretext to begin a more extensive military operation against Poland. The Polish army, led by the king and aided by Lithuanian units, advanced on the borderland Duchy of Troppau, and captured the towns of Pszczyna and Rybnik. However, the John of Bohemia stood in the military camp near Wodzis≈Çaw. Faced with a Bohemian counter-attack, Poles retreated to Krak√≥w. Bohemian army unsuccessfully besieged Krak√≥w (around 12 to 20 July 1345; ), and suffered further defeats at the and the . An armistice was signed later that year, and soon the Bohemians found themselves in a much stronger position, as Charles was elected the Holy Roman Emperor in 1346. Fighting was renewed in spring/summer of 1348, with engagements near Wroc≈Çaw (Breslau). Through the engagements were not conclusive, and even favorable to the Polish side, the two sides decided to settle the issue through diplomacy, to focus on more other threats (such as, for Poland, that of the Teutonic Knights).  Aftermath  The war ended with the Treaty of Namys≈Ç√≥w signed on 22 November 1348 in which the Poles de facto renounced their claims to Silesia (the documents do not contain a clear statement to that effect but have been interpreted in such a way by later historians, since it left most of Silesia under de jure control of Bohemians), and the Bohemians renounced their claims to the Polish throne. No territorial changes occurred. This cemented Bohemian control over most of Silesia.

It is believed to have been built in the 1350s and dedicated to the mother of Sultan Hassan. It is notable for its unique pair of stone domes.  Historical background  al-Qarafa) around it at the beginning of the 20th century. Much of the northern dome is missing. Other Mamluk structures are visible, including the ruined mausoleum of Qawsun (dome on the left and minaret on the right). Sultan an-Nasir Hassan's mother died when he was still a child, and he was instead raised by a stepmother (named by Maqrizi as either Ardu or Tughay). Little is known about the mausoleum or Sultan Hassan's mother, as no original waqf documents for this building have survived. The building was instead identified indirectly with the help of the waqf document of the nearby Mosque of Nur al-Din, built by the Ottoman governor Masih Pasha in 1575, which mentions a mausoleum belonging to Sultan Hassan's mother standing next to it. Additionally, the bold architectural forms of the structure and the fact that the domes are made of stone (rather than brick or wood), suggests that the building was issued from royal patronage. Based on this information, it is believed to have been built by Sultan Hassan during his reign around the 1350s. The name sultaniyya means \\"sultanic\\" or \\"royal\\", and may have been a popular name given to the structure. The cemetery in which the mausoleum is located was originally a cemetery founded by the Bahri Mamluks in 1290, on land near the Citadel that was formerly used for military training exercises (next to this was also a Mamluk hippodrome which existed for centuries). The mausoleum and khanqah of Amir Qawsun, which was built in 1335, also stands very close by and possessed a similar layout as the Sultaniyya. A part of the Sultaniyya complex, including its courtyard, has disappeared, and its current remains were restored in modern times.  Description  Details of the northern dome exterior. The drum (cylindrical section) has a surface carved in Square Kufic Arabic letters. Inside one of the tomb chambers. The structure's most distinctive feature is its two stone domes, which are ribbed or fluted on the outside, have a pointed \\"bulbous\\" profile, and stand on high drums (the cylindrical sections below the spherical part of the dome). The stone \\"ribs\\" end in a slim cornice of muqarnas above the edge of the drums. This form is very reminiscent of Timurid architecture in Samarkand (e.g. the Gur-e-Amir) but predates the latter by half a century, most likely indicating that it originated here first in Cairo. Similar dome shapes appear at the Madrasa of Sarghitmish (also in Cairo), which was built around the same time, and possibly at the slightly earlier Khanqah of Amir Shaykhu. The original dome of Sultan Hassan's own massive mausoleum, also built during his reign, was described as having a similar shape as well (though it no longer exists today as it was replaced with a different type of dome). However, none of these other contemporary domes had the same ribbed form with muqarnas and none of them were built in stone, making the Sultaniyya's domes unique. The two domes are very similar to each other but not quite identical. The drum of the northern dome is covered in \\"square\\" Kufic Arabic letters carved over the stone surface. It's possible that this was meant to appear on the drum of the other dome too but that it was left unfinished. Both domes have an Arabic inscription running around the top edge of their drums. The two domes are also \\"double\\" domes; which is to say that they have an outer shell (visible from the exterior) and an inner shell which covers the mausoleum chamber under them. Inside the mausoleum chambers, the transition between the round domes and the square chamber is achieved through the use of pendentives carved in muqarnas forms. Each mausoleum chamber has its own simple stone mihrab (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer). Between the two domes and tomb chambers is a large iwan (a vaulted chamber open to one side), with an inscription running along its walls. This iwan has a stone mihrab whose upper section is carved with muqarnas in a style similar to the lateral (side) niches of the entrance portal of the Madrasa-Mosque of Sultan Hassan, possibly of Anatolian (Turkish) inspiration. This iwan was probably used for prayers and most likely faced a large courtyard which was adjoined to the mausoleum structure. Nearby, presumably at the opposing end of the vanished courtyard, rises the mausoleum's minaret, which now appears to stand alone but originally would have been connected to the mausoleum by the outer walls of the complex. The minaret, with an octagonal shaft, is similar to the minarets of the Madrasa-Mosque of Sultan Hasan, but its surfaces are also covered with arabesque stone carvings, in addition to the usual muqarnas carvings under the balconies. The whole complex was likely originally intended to be used as a khanqah (Sufi lodge) in addition to the mausoleums, much like the funerary complex of Qawsun nearby.

Although his family was not wealthy, they were politically connected (his uncle, Manoel Rodrigues Villares (1804-1878), served as a Minister of the Supreme Federal Court), so he was able to gain entrance to the Col√©gio Pedro II and the Academia Imperial de Belas Artes. There, he studied with Victor Meirelles and Pedro Am√©rico. √çndio from the Vaup√©s River region In 1870, he began providing caricatures for the satirical magazine, Com√©dia Social, published by Am√©rico and his younger brother, , who was also a student there at that time. For unknown reasons, he was frequently absent from his classes, did not participate in exhibitions and did not compete for the travel scholarship. Eventually, he dropped out.Elisabete Da Costa Leal, Os fil√≥sofos em tintas e bronze: arte, positivismo e pol√≠tica na obra de D√©cio Villares e Eduardo de S√° UFRJ, 2006 Online For the next nine years, he travelled, initially (1872) to Paris. There, he studied in the workshops of Alexandre Cabanel. In 1874, he was awarded a gold medal at the Salon for his painting of Paolo Malatesta and Francesca da Rimini, which was praised by the notoriously difficult-to-please art critic, . During that period, he was first exposed to the positivist philosophy of Auguste Comte and abandoned Catholicism. This would result in his being rejected for a teaching position at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts. He then went from Paris to Florence, where Pedro Am√©rico maintained a studio. He may have studied sculpture with . It is not known exactly how long he stayed in Italy, although letters indicate that he was still there in 1878. It is possible that he returned briefly to France. What is known for certain is that he returned to Brazil in 1881. Soon after, he and Aur√©lio de Figueiredo received a major commission: eighteen paintings of the Aimor√© people for display at the Brazilian Anthropological Exhibition of 1882; made from sketches and photographs. The general publicity accorded to the exhibition enabled him to establish himself and launch a successful career.Luiz Carlos Borges and Mar√≠lia Braz Botelho, Positivismo e artes pl√°sticas: O Museu Nacional e a I Exposi√ß√£o Antropol√≥gica Brasileira (1882), FIOCRUZ, 2012 In 1887, he and Jos√© Ferraz de Almeida J√∫nior were chosen to replace Victor Meirelles in the history painting department at the Academia Imperial, but they never did. Three years later, he and De Figueiredo were part of a group that presented a proposal for a new method of teaching that would emphasize the master/apprentice relationship and abolish the Academia. In 1901, he married Maria Dolores de Souza Martins. They received both Catholic and positivist rites (what the positivists called a \\"mixed marriage\\") but, following positivist practice, declared their desire for \\"eternal widowhood\\". It proved to be a difficult marriage. She was addicted to morphine and, once, in a drug-induced haze, set their apartment on fire. She was arrested and sent to a sanatorium and Villares, who was on a lengthy business trip, allowed her to stay there. After a year, she charged him with psychological cruelty, abandonment and theft of her family inheritance. Despite this, they never had a formal separation. When he was forced to be away from home, she was watched over by members of the Positivist Church.Teixeira Mendes, Pelo escrupulozo respeito a reputa√ß√£o privada, - pessoal e dom√©stica, - intimamente ligado √† regenera√ß√£o social.

Shortly before scrapping she was renamed Fatshan I.  Construction and commissioning  Fatshan was commissioned by the HongKong, Canton & Macao Steamboat Company as a passenger steamer to service the Hong Kong to Canton route. She was built in Leith at the Victoria Shipyard by the Ramage & Ferguson & Company and was launched on 21 March 1887. The ship was measured at 2,260 gross register tons and initially was powered by two triple- expansion steam engines capable of producing 173 nhp driving twin screws  Hong Kong Canton Line with the Hongkong Canton & Macao Steamboat Company  After her delivery, Fatshan commenced service with the Hongkong Canton & Macao Steamboat Company, the leading ferry company sailing in the area at the time. At the time of its introduction, Fatshan was well known in the China trade as one of the best passenger steamers sailing the Hong Kong to Canton. The ship was divided between Chinese and European passengers and owing to the dangers faced by pirates, the ship was armed with small arms and a complement of guards.  Hong Kong-Canton Line with the China Navigation Company  On 18 September 1906, a typhoon struck Hong Kong catching Fatshan in the eastern part of Victoria Harbour near the Taikoo Dockyard. The storm drove Fatshan and several other ships onto the shore of northern Hong Kong island. The ship was refloated by the end of the year. During the evening of 27 July and into the morning of 28 July 1908 another severe Typhoon struck Hong Kong. During the storm three steam ships were approaching Hong Kong from Canton: of the Sing On Steamship Company, Fatshan and . The three ships sought shelter, dropping anchor at The Brothers north of Lantau Island. Tragically, during the storm, a sudden squall struck the anchored ships and it was reported that after this squall Ying King foundered and disappeared from the view of the other two ships. The sinking resulted in the loss of 421 lives, with only 42 survivors recovered on 28 July by the Customs launch Kowloon Sai.The Register of Adelaide, South Australia (31 August 1908, page 6), quoting from the China Mail of 18 August 1908 regarding the details of an enquiry into the tragic loss of HK-Canton steamer Ying King. Later, on 29 November 1908, Fatshan was the subject of a political crisis that took place in Hong Kong and Canton Province after the apparent murder aboard the ship of a Chinese passenger, one Ho Yiu-tiu (also referred to as Ho Tsoi-yin), allegedly perpetrated by a Portuguese crewman. The incident occurred when the steamer was en route to Canton from Hong Kong. Eyewitnesses alleged that they had seen the Portuguese crew member, one Mr. Noronha, a ticket collector, kicking the Chinese passenger following a dispute. Upon arriving at Canton, an autopsy was performed on the deceased by the Canton Red Cross Society which found that the deceased had died from wounds caused by the incident. Soon after, an official inquest was called for. Given that the incident had occurred on board British property, the British Consulate at Canton asserted their right to jurisdiction in the matter. British inquiry also called for a separate autopsy to be performed by a British doctor, who found that the deceased had suffered from heart troubles and that the death was likely due to natural causes; the charge of homicide against Mr. Noronha was to be dropped. These events coincided with a series of incidents of civil unrest ongoing at the time. Coincidentally, the incident caught the attention of the Self-Government Society who called for a boycott of Fatshan and its parent company and also for civic uprising in Canton and Hong Kong. The boycott was successful and eventually led to a private settlement with the Self-Government Society.Taikoo by Charles Drage published 1970, pages 170‚Äì2  See also  * China Navigation Company  References  Category:1887 ships Category:Cargo ships Category:Ships built in Leith Category:Ships of Hong Kong Category:Steamships of Hong Kong ","title":"SS Fatshan (1887)"},{"id":"62215336","text":"Radhika Menon is an Indian female merchant navy officer currently serving as the captain of the Indian Merchant Navy.

He was one of the few Buddhist priests in Hawaii who was not interned during World War II, and is best known for the memorial tablets he created for Japanese American soldiers in the 442nd and 100th.  Early life and education  Tottori was born in Shizuoka, Japan on May 6, 1898. He studied at what is now Shuchiin University, and graduated in 1924. He then studied at the Koyasan before being assigned a mission in Hawaii.  Hawaii  Tottori moved to Hawaii in 1925 and served at the Hawaii Shingon Mission in Honolulu. In 1927 he became the priest at the Komyoji Temple in Wailuku. He met and married Aiko Fujitani before returning to Oahu to serve at the Koshoji Temple in Haleiwa. Tottori also regularly wrote for the Hawaii Mikkyo, a Buddhist publication. On December 7, 1941, right after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Tottori was brought in for questioning. He was released a few days later, unlike many other Buddhist priests who were interned for the duration of World War II, because the articles that he wrote for the Hawaii Mikkyo and other publications advocated for the Americanization of Japanese immigrants in much the same way that Yemyo Imamura had. Throughout the war, Tottori held private services and wrote memorial tablets () for Japanese American soldiers who had died on the battlefield. He maintained a prayer book for them regardless of their own religious beliefs. He also gave them posthumous Buddhist names. After World War II, he conducted services for men who died in the Korean War. In 1946, after World War II ended, Tottori returned to Honolulu and became the bishop of the Hawaii Shingon Mission. He started a temple pilgrimage called the Hichi Kasho Meguri. Pilgrims would travel to seven temples across Hawaii, including the Hawaii Shingon Mission, the McCully Shingon Mission, the Palolo Kannonji, and the Liliha Shingon Mission. He was also awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure by the Japanese government. Tottori died on January 6, 1976.

Couldrey and Edward Gabriel, the church was built in 1887‚Äì88 and has been a Grade II listed building since 1993. History Christ Church was built at a time when Paignton was undergoing rapid growth and expansion. Efforts towards the construction of a new church had been made from around 1863, but these early efforts did not come to fruition and neither did a proposal to begin conducting services at Paignton's Temperance Hall. In April 1886, a public meeting was held at the hall to determine whether a separate ecclesiastical district should be formed in the northern region of Paignton parish and a new church erected to serve it. Mrs. Disney Robinson of Torquay had already promised ¬£1,500 towards the endowment. The result of the meeting was to begin raising subscriptions and a building committee was established. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners agreed to match Mrs. Robinson's sum for the endowment and provide a plot of land large enough for the proposed church, along with a vicarage and school. The new church was designed by Mr. Walter G. Couldrey of Paington and Mr. Edward Gabriel of London as joint architects. Messrs. Christopher and Robert Elliott Drew of Paignton were the builders, with Messrs. Delafield and Pollard of Paignton handling the freestone work and Mr. W. Leaman as clerk of the works. Prior to its construction, an iron church was erected on the site in August 1886 to provide temporary church accommodation. The foundation stone of Christ Church was laid by the Bishop of Exeter, the Right Rev. Edward Bickersteth, on 26 April 1887. It had been intended for Mrs. Disney Robinson to lay the stone, but heavy rain prevented her attendance. The church was completed a month ahead of schedule and was consecrated by the Bishop of Exeter on 1 June 1888. With its completion, the ecclesiastical parish of Christ Church was formed. The original iron church was then used as a Sunday school. It was intended to replace it with permanent premises, but the scheme did not come to fruition. The vicarage attached to Christ Church was built in 1894. In 2002, Christ Church and St Paul's were united as a joint benefice. The original iron church remains in use as the church hall. Architecture Christ Church is built of local red sandstone, with freestone dressings, in the Early English style. Designed to accommodate 600 persons, it is made up of a nave with clerestory, chancel, narrow north and south aisles, north and south transepts, organ chamber and vestry. A tower and spire was intended for the church, but lack of funds meant this was never built. Original fittings include the pulpit of Caen stone with Devonshire marble pillars, and the lectern, made up of a brass eagle perched on a slab of rough Dartmoor granite and a polished slab base.

T. dalmanni flies possess lateral elongations on their head capsules called eyestalks. These eyestalks play an important role in mate selection and as a result physical characteristic of the fly has been the subject of several studies on sexual selection, natural selection, and mating behavior.  Distribution  Teleopsis dalmanni is found in Malaysia as well as other parts of Southeast Asia. Flies used in studies are usually collected in Malaysia.  Habitat  Teleopsis dalmanni are predominantly found at the edge of forest streams, where their mating rituals occur. They have been observed resting on dried leaves or undergrowth at the water‚Äôs edge, and occasionally even on the sand.  Life history  As with other Dipterans, T. dalmanni flies undergo a larval phase before transitioning into adults. There is little information available on the systematics and behavior of the larval stage in T. dalmanni. As holometabolous insects, the flies have dividing cells restricted to the gut and gonads. Due to this, the adult size is fixed by the nutrition received in the larval phase. Following the larval stage, further nutrition is required for the development of internal reproductive structures to reach sexual maturity. Breeding experiments typically assign three to six weeks for these flies to reach sexual maturity, but a value for wild fly populations has not been determined with confidence. Sexual maturity can be indicated by accessory gland growth, maturing of sperm bundles, and sperm motility. Accessory gland growth was found to have the largest effect on sexual maturity, but it is not the sole effect.  Food resources  Adult flies exhibit solitary foraging behavior, feeding on rotting vegetative matter in the daytime.  Mating  Female T. dalmanni roost on root threads overhanging streams at dusk. Males compete to gain control of these root hairs. Upon gaining control of a root hair they form harems, and females decide which male‚Äôs harem to join. Studies have shown that females prefer to roost with males with larger eye-spans. Mating occurs at dawn, and usually multiple mating events take place. Research shows that increased mating frequency correlates with a higher proportion of fertile eggs. This is supported by the idea that multiple matings do not reduce the receptivity of a female fly to copulation, regardless of the characteristics of the mating male. Studies showed that the number of copulation events rather than the number of mates led to an increase in hatching success. Additionally, a large number of copulations are unsuccessful, with a study finding that females that copulated once had a hatching success rate of only 10%. Copulation specifics are not entirely understood, but some copulation events are rapid and last less than 60 seconds. = Spermatophores = Male flies produce gourd-shaped spermatophores that occupy only a part of the vaginal capacity, as compared to the spermatophores of certain other diopsid flies that occupy the entire vaginal cavity. It has been suggested that the smaller size of the spermatophore is an adaptation to reduce investment in sperm due to a high mating frequency in a short amount of time. Accessory glands are responsible for forming the spermatophore that transports sperm during mating.  Morphology  = Eyestalks = The eyestalks of T. dalmanni, as well as other Diopsidae flies, are frequently used to study the fields of sexual selection and mating preference. Eyestalks have been known to range from 4 mm in length up to 17 mm. Eyestalks can even be longer than body length. Hyperencephaly of the type that resembles the eyestalks in T. dalmanni is seen is other Dipteran organisms, but flies of the family Diopsidae are unique in that both males and females display some degree of eyestalk elongation. In T. dalmanni flies, males have larger eye-spans relative to body length compared to females. This feature of the fly is subject to studies that investigate the genetic background of sexual selection, female mating preferences and reproductive consequences.  Mate choice  Eyestalks play an important role in mating behavior, as studies have shown that females prefer males with larger eye spans relative to body length. It was found that female preference for large eye-spans is evident when the difference between eye-spans of available males is large, not moderate. In cases of low and moderate difference, a female with a large eye-span is more likely to pick the male with larger eye-span. There are multiple theories posited to explain this, including the idea that female preference for male eye-span may have a ceiling, or that female choice is linked genetically to female eye-span.  Sexual selection  Sexual selection posits that structures that are perceived as reliable indicators of individual quality are selected for. Teleopsis dalmanni eyestalks are an example of sexual dimorphism that has developed for mating purposes; larger eye-span is selected for as evidence indicates that it is preferred by females. A study also found that female individuals with larger eye-spans had significantly more mature oocytes than those with shorter eye-spans. Furthermore, eye-span independent of body size or mass has been identified as the key determinant in the outcomes of contests between males. This suggests that longer eyestalks developed in males as a result of mating success pressure, and hence are an example of sexual selection. However, it has been shown that females that mated with males with large eye-spans did not receive short-term fecundity benefits and fertility benefits, and in fact recorded a lower fertility rate than females mating with males with short eye-spans.  Handicap hypothesis  Male eye-span is strongly dependent on conditional factors, comparatively more than other non-sexual traits, and eye-span becomes variable under conditions of increased stress. Similar patterns are not seen in comparable nonsexual traits, and are more closely correlated with body size. The hypothesis drawn from these results is that eye-span provides additional information about the condition beyond that provided by body size. Hence eye-span could be an alternative indication to females of the male's greater ability to survive. This relates to the handicap theory of evolution of ornamental male traits. However, studies cite a lack of evidence to support the idea that the extended eye-stalks are a handicap to male Diopsid flies. While the eye-stalk increases the moment of inertia of male flies, they were not found to suffer a flight performance decrement. Specifically T. dalmanni male flies were found to perform better than females in free-flying turning behavior. If longer eyespans do not pose a handicap to male flies, an alternative explanation may be more successful in explaining the development of this trait. = Eyes = Teleopsis dalmanni has been used as a study subject in experimental subject in studies on data processing in insect optic centers, as it is easy to record impulse activity in the eyestalk.

It was released on May 7, 2019, by Woollim Entertainment and distributed by Kakao M. Having released two ballad mini-albums since 2016, Nam sought to expand his musical palette and facilitate his growth as a musician. He ultimately crafted a dance record with his stories embedded in the lyrics. After a series of photo and video teasers, A New Journey and its lead single \\"Hold on Me\\" featuring rapper Junoflo were concurrently released. Nam held a showcase for the mini-album and promoted the song by performing on music chart programs across various television networks. A New Journey peaked at number two on South Korea's national Gaon Album Chart, shifting over 42,000 units domestically since its release. Background Nam crafted A New Journey amid preparations to play the lead roles in the musicals The Days and Mefisto, and in midst of a concert tour throughout Asia. On previous singles \\"Still I Remember\\" (Write.., 2016) and \\"If Only You Are Fine\\" (Second Write.., 2018), he was noted as the \\"representative performer of emotional ballads\\". The title reflects Nam's new musical direction. He sought to showcase musical maturity and explore diverse genres throughout the album tracks. In wanting the lyrics, thoughts, and melodies he identified with to \\"melt deeply\\" into the record, Nam prioritized his storytelling. The record was set to be released earlier, but was delayed to \\"enhance its completeness\\". The album was recorded in Seoul at Woollim Studio and mixed at W Sound, LAFX, InGrid Studio, and Mapps Studio. It was mastered at 821 Sound Mastering. Unlike his previous solo endeavors, Nam implemented choreography in his songs. He prepared by modifying his diet, doing weight training, exercising, and managing his health. Music structure A dance album, A New Journey integrates EDM and funk into its sound. Nam wrote the lyrics to four tracks and contributed to two of the compositions. He penned songs based on his experiences over the past ten years. The record opens with \\"Intro\\", an \\"upbeat\\" track without lyrics which \\"gives the impression of leaving somewhere for the first time\\". Nam described as \\"essential to setting the tone\\" of the album. It is followed by \\"Hold on Me\\", a dance-pop song with elements of house music that incorporates acoustic and electric guitar into the track. Nam described it as a \\"sharp\\" song with a \\"strong accent\\". Rapper Junoflo features on the song. A fan of his work on the rap competition series Show Me the Money and his music, Nam reached out to him for a collaboration. While on tour in the United States, Junoflo traveled to South Korea to work on the song. A portion of his rap was done in English due to his comfort with the language. \\"Rain\\" was composed by MC the Max member J. Yoon and the lyrics deal with \\"overcoming pain and hardships\\". Nam's \\"wide\\" vocal range oscillates throughout the dance track, evoking a \\"dreamy\\" ambience. He stated that \\"emotions become moisturized\\" and \\"old memories often occur\\" as a result of rain; the \\"slightly damp smell\\" of precipitation led him to conceive the song lyrics. \\"Stranger\\" is a dance-pop song with an emphasis on guitar riffs and bass. Nam described the song as a mixture of urban music and funk, and he stated that it was a candidate as the lead single for A New Journey. The track's melody was crafted and completed during a nine-hour session with HSND, Adrian Mckinnon, and Galaxy. On \\"Crying Baby\\", Nam employs his lyrical voice and a \\"classy sound\\" with an undercurrent of synthpop. The song serves as an encouraging message to \\"lonely people under the weight of life\\". After listening to the demo, he utilized a vocal technique for the track to fit his style. In \\"Just Look at Me\\", the narrator tells his girlfriend to \\"look at me, as I promise to look at you forever\\". It is described as a \\"sexy and warm\\" song. The closing track \\"Flower\\" is a medium- tempo confession song on guitar and piano. In the lyrics, he conveys his gratitude and love for his fans, likening them to sunflowers. Release and promotion Woollim Entertainment announced A New Journey and shared an image teaser via social media on April 29, 2019. It showcased a \\"mellow\\" Nam standing on a bridge late at night. A second picture was posted on May 1, presenting Nam in a red-lit setting and \\"dreamlike\\" atmosphere. A short version music video teaser for the lead single \\"Hold on Me\\" was published the following day. On May 4, a longer version music video teaser was unveiled. A album preview of the mini-album was shared on the subsequent day. A New Journey and the music video for \\"Hold on Me\\" were simultaneously released on May 7. Hosted by MC Haru, Nam held a showcase for the mini-album at Ilji Art Hall in the Cheongdam-dong ward of Seoul. Nam began promoting \\"Hold on Me\\" on weekly music chart shows two days later. Due to Junoflo's commitments abroad, Tag of idol group Golden Child performed in his place alongside Nam during the promotion cycle. In addition to the lead single, Nam also performed \\"Rain\\" on Mnet's M Countdown, KBS2's Music Bank, Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation's (MBC) Show! Music Core, Seoul Broadcasting System's (SBS) Inkigayo, SBS MTV's The Show, and MBC Music's Show Champion.

It is located in the centre of the Hessian city of Darmstadt. Today the castle is the seat of the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt and the German-Polish Institute.  Location  Today the castle is located in the centre of the Darmstadt, at the eastern end of the Rheinstra√üe, which leads from the west into the city.  History  The origins of the castle lie in the Katzenelnbogen time. In the middle of the 13th century the counts of Katzenelnbogen built a moated castle in Darmstadt. In 1330 Darmstadt received town rights, one year later the castle is mentioned for the first time in a document. From 1386, the moated castle loses importance and becomes a widow's residence and secondary residence. In the following two centuries, the counts of Katzenelnbogen extended and rebuilt the castle again and again. Until the middle of the 15th century the castle was transformed into a representative castle and Darmstadt became Katzenelnbogen's second residence. What remains of the moated castle are the form of the central church courtyard and the outer walls of the manor house. When the last count von Katzenelnbogen died in 1479, Darmstadt fell to Henry III, Landgrave of Upper Hesse. When Philip I took over the government offices in 1518, the castle was destroyed for the first time in an attack by Franz von Sickingen. The castle was rebuilt in the following years, but with essentially the same defensive structures. During the Schmalkaldic War in 1546 it was destroyed again by imperial troops. Landgrave George I considerably extended the castle from 1567 to a Renaissance complex and secured it with moats and bastions. The half-timbered floors of the former palace and the hall are rebuilt from stone. The buildings received new roofs. Christoph M√ºller, Jakob Wust and from 1580 Jakob Kesselhuth developed the old moated castle into a residential palace. After 1589 the office, the stables and the arsenal were built, which no longer exist today. From 1594, the landgrave had orphans educated in the castle. From 1595 to 1597 the Kaisersaal (Emperor's room) and the church were built. The tympanum corridor, which connects the manor with the church, was also built. The Wallh√§uschen, a gate building in the north of the castle, was built in 1627 by Jakob M√ºller. The bell building was built from 1663 to 1671 according to plans by the architect Johann Wilhelm Pfannm√ºller. Darmstadt was attacked by the French in 1693. The keep of the castle was destroyed. Landgrave Ernst Ludwig commissioned the French architect Louis Remy de la Fosse to plan a new baroque palace with four large wings in 1715, after the palace's chancellery had burned down. This was to completely replace the old palace. Due to lack of money, however, only two wings were completed by 1726. These were to remain the last major structural changes to the castle. When Hessen-Darmstadt joined the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806, the castle became the seat of the Grand Dukes of Darmstadt. At the beginning of the 19th century, the upper floors of the new castle were furnished and fitted with window glazing. In 1842, the university and state library and the grand ducal collection with natural history cabinet moved in. Since the 18th century the castle has been less and less inhabited by the grand dukes. More and more institutes were admitted and some of the rooms were reserved for state guests. In 1893, under Ernst Ludwig, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine, structural measures were again being taken. Thus the extension with a tea pavilion was built on the Herrenbau. In 1924, the castle museum moved into the old area of the castle. After the World War I, the castle passed into the possession of the People's State of Hesse. On the night of the fire in Darmstadt from 11 to 12 September 1944, the castle burned down to the outer walls. Reconstruction began in 1946 and was not completed until the early 1970s. 2008 An overall repair is carried out, which is planned for a longer period of time. 2016 The bell construction is completed. The outer appearance was almost completely restored. Today the castle is the seat of the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt and the German- Polish Institute.  Construction  alt=Today, the castle consists of two wings with an S-shaped ground plan under a gambrel that meet perpendicularly. The east wing is single-storey, the west wing two-storey. The castle is divided into three areas: the outer fortification, the Renaissance castle and the Baroque castle. Towards the town one comes across the mighty Baroque building, which consists of two wings. It is quite symmetrical and characterises the image of the former castle to the south and west. The north is occupied by a park that belongs to the old fortification. In its place was once the deep moat that completely surrounded the Residenzschloss Darmstadt. Also recognizable in the north and northwest are the mighty bastions that were to protect the castle in this direction with the advent of firearms. In the southeast is the bell building. It is a tall building with a 39 m high bell tower on its courtyard side. The centrepiece of the Residential Palace Darmstadt is the old Renaissance palace. Today it still has the almost triangular shape of the old core castle and consists of the castle wings Herrenbau, Wei√üer Saalbau, Kaisersaalbau, Kirchenbau and the church courtyard. Access to the courtyard is from the north, as it was then. Here a portal building was placed in front of which there was originally a drawbridge. From the town, a less fortified gate leads directly through the baroque castle into the southern courtyard.  Music festival Schlossgrabenfest  Since 1999 the Schlossgrabenfest, the largest music festival in Hesse and one of the largest open-air events in Germany, has taken place every year on the last weekend of May around the Residential Palace Darmstadt and Friedens- und Karolinenplatz in Darmstadt. The musical spectrum ranges from rock, pop, electro, reggae and hip-hop to soul and jazz.

He attained the rank of brigadier general during World War I as commander of the 157th Infantry Brigade, a unit of the 79th Division. He was most notable for leading his brigade to victory during the September 1918 Battle of Montfaucon, part of the first phase of the Meuse- Argonne Offensive, for which he received the Distinguished Service Cross. A native of Washington, DC and the son of a career United States Navy officer, Nicholson was educated in Washington and in 1876 successfully applied for a commission as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. He served primarily with the 7th Cavalry Regiment, and advanced through the ranks to command the regiment's 1st Squadron, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, 5th Cavalry Regiment, and 11th Cavalry Regiment. Nicholson was a veteran of the American Indian Wars, Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and Pancho Villa Expedition. He was temporarily promoted to brigadier general for World War I and commanded the 157th Infantry Brigade. Nicholson led his brigade during the capture of Montfaucon, and continued in command during subsequent fighting. After the war, he commanded the 152nd Depot Brigade, where he oversaw the demobilization and discharge of soldiers returning home after the Armistice. Nicholson retired as a colonel in 1920 and resided in Washington, DC. In 1927, he was restored to the rank of brigadier general on the Army's retired list. He died in Washington on December 20, 1931 and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Early life William Jones Nicholson was born in Washington, D.C. on January 16, 1856, a child of Somerville Jones Nicholson (1822-1905), a career United States Navy officer, and Hannah Maria (Jones) Nicholson (1837-1897). His siblings included Reginald F. Nicholson, who attained the rank of rear admiral in the Navy and was a veteran of both the American Civil War and World War I. William Nicholson attended the schools of Washington and Georgetown Preparatory School. With the 7th Cavalry Regiment's officer corps depleted by the June 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn, the organization moved quickly to replenish the ranks of its lieutenants and captains. Nicholson successfully requested an appointment as a second lieutenant later that year. His application was aided by endorsements from family and social connections, including John B. Blake, the Secretary of the Washington National Monument Society, and William Wilson Corcoran. Nicholson was commissioned in the 7th Cavalry directly from civilian life and reported to the Cavalry depot near St. Louis, Missouri for his initial training and to take charge of a group of recruits bound for Fort Abraham Lincoln. He was initially assigned to the 7th Cavalry‚Äôs Troop B. Start of career Nicholson initially performed frontier duty with the 7th Cavalry‚Äôs Troops B, G and M during the American Indian Wars and was assigned to posts including Fort Meade, Fort Abraham Lincoln, and Fort Leavenworth. He took part in the final stages of the Little Bighorn Campaign, including the Battle of Canyon Creek against the Nez Perce Indians in September 1877. Nicholson‚Äôs Troop G was part of an ad hoc battalion commanded by Frederick Benteen, and soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Regiment witnessed the heroism of Nicholson and two other lieutenants as they led mounted charges during the fighting, which led to Benteen commending them by name in his official report. In 1879, Major Marcus Reno was accused of several crimes and incidents of misconduct, including drunkenly assaulting Nicholson with a pool cue during a game in a public billiard hall at Fort Meade, causing injuries to Nicholson. Nicholson preferred charges, and in April 1880, Reno was convicted of conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline for his assault on Nicholson and other offenses. He was sentenced to dismissal from the service. Nicholson was a noted horseman and during his career he took part in numerous equestrian activities, including stakes races, polo matches, and horse shows. In 1883, Nicholson graduated from the Infantry and Cavalry School. In January 1884, he was promoted to first lieutenant in the 7th Cavalry's Troop M. From 1884 to 1887, he served as professor of military science and tactics at Kansas State University. In October 1888, Nicholson was assigned to Troop G and was part of a 7th Cavalry contingent that marched from Fort Riley to Topeka, Kansas to participate in festivities at a week long reunion of Grand Army of the Republic members and members of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Afterward, Nicholson returned to Troop M, and in August 1890, he was assigned to Troop I. In December 1890, Nicholson was serving as adjutant of the 7th Cavalry‚Äôs 1st Squadron, commanded by Samuel Whitside. In this capacity, he took part in the military action against the Lakota people that led to the Wounded Knee Massacre. Nicholson testified at the 1891 military inquiry headed by Nelson A. Miles and stated that he observed Troops B and K engage Lakota warriors after the warriors fired at the soldiers, but that the soldiers had made every possible effort to spare women and children. He was later assigned to Troop D, and in 1893 Nicholson was transferred to Troop H. In 1896, Nicholson was serving as the 7th Cavalry‚Äôs regimental adjutant when he was promoted to captain and assigned to command Troop C. In 1897, Nicholson commanded Troop C during frontier duty at Fort Grant, Arizona. Spanish-American War During the Spanish-American War, Nicholson initially commanded Troop C, 7th Cavalry. In June 1898, Nicholson was appointed as mustering officer for troops from Maryland and Virginia. Based at Fort Monroe, he was responsible for enrolling National Guard members and civilians who volunteered for army service. He was promoted to temporary major in July 1898 and attached as ordnance officer on the staff of 2nd Division, First Army Corps. In October 1898, Nicholson was assigned as chief mustering officer for the state of Kentucky. In early 1899, Nicholson commanded Troop C, 7th Cavalry during service at Pinar del Rio, Cuba. In March, he was appointed US Indian Agent at the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation in Arizona and reverted to his permanent rank of captain. During his tenure, Nicholson took steps to curb the grazing of herds on Indian land without permission, a practice in which many white Arizonans were involved. Continued career Nicholson was transferred to the 12th Cavalry Regiment in 1901. He served in the Philippines and was promoted to the permanent rank of major in 1904. Later that year, he returned to the 7th Cavalry and was stationed at Camp George H. Thomas, Georgia. In 1905, Nicholson was the chief inspector and advisor for the Pennsylvania National Guard. From 1906 to 1907 he served with the Philippine Division as a member of the Department of Luzon‚Äôs staff, where he performed staff duties including adjutant, signal officer, and surveying officer. From 1907 to 1911, Nicholson commanded 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry, based at Fort Riley, Kansas. In 1911, Nicholson was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and from 1911 to 1912 he served as surveying officer on the staff of the Department of Luzon. Nicholson was promoted to colonel in September 1912. From November 1913 to February 1915, Nicholson was commander of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, based at Fort Ethan Allen, Vermont. From 1915 to 1916, Nicholson planned and organized the instruction of military-minded civilians as commander of the Citizens' Military Training Camp at Fort Sheridan, Illinois. In 1916 and 1917, he commanded first the 5th Cavalry Regiment, and later the 11th Cavalry Regiment, during their participation in the Pancho Villa Expedition. In the spring of 1917, Nicholson supervised cavalry instruction for noncommissioned officer schools, officer candidate schools, and Organized Reserve Corps schools in Texas. In the summer of 1917, Nicholson commanded the Officer Candidate School at Fort Sheridan. World War I Nicholson poses with his 157th Infantry Brigade staff in France, October 1918 On August 5, 1917 Nicholson was promoted to brigadier general in the National Army and assigned to command the 157th Infantry Brigade, a unit of the 79th Division. The brigade included the 313th Infantry Regiment, 314th Infantry Regiment, and 311th Machine Gun Battalion and it completed its initial organization and training at Camp Meade, Maryland. The brigade arrived in France in July 1918 and completed additional training before entering combat in September. During the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, Nicholson‚Äôs unit was tasked with capturing a key terrain feature, Montfaucon. During the battle, Nicholson‚Äôs brigade command post staff lost contact with the 79th Division headquarters, so Nicholson continued pressing the attack on his own initiative. When the brigade staff lost contact with the 314th Infantry‚Äôs headquarters, Nicholson opted to stay on the offensive with the 313th Infantry. During the fighting, Nicholson personally located and traveled on horseback to the 79th Division‚Äôs headquarters to arrange for artillery support to the 313th Infantry. As he returned to his brigade command post, it came under attack from German machine guns and artillery. Nicholson remounted his horse and road forward to his brigade headquarters, where he issued orders to continue the attack on Montfaucon, directed his staff‚Äôs planning, supervised unit preparations, and then led the renewed action that finally captured the objective. For his heroism and leadership while under fire, Nicholson received the Distinguished Service Cross. After the Montfaucon battle, Nicholson's brigade was moved to the Troyon sector. After reorganizing and reequipping, the division prepared to reenter combat near Verdun. Upon arrival in late October, the 79th Division relieved the 26th Division and assumed its place in the front line. The 79th Division resumed the offensive in early November and was still engaged in offensive operations on November 11, 1918, when the Armistice ended the war. At age 62, Nicholson was the oldest U.S. soldier known to have seen combat during World War I -- the few generals older than him, including Hugh L. Scott, Tasker H. Bliss and William Abram Mann, served in training, staff, and administrative roles. Nicholson was acting commander of the 79th Division on several occasions in 1917 and 1918. These dates included November 26, 1917 to February 16, 1918; April 15, 1918; May 22 to June 7, 1918; and June 28 to July 22, 1918. Later career On his return to the United States, Nicholson commanded the 152nd Depot Brigade at Camp Upton, New York where he oversaw the demobilization and discharge of soldiers returning from France. In January 1920, he reached the mandatory retirement age of 64 and retired at his permanent rank of colonel. At the time of his retirement, Nicholson was the Army's most senior officer with respect to time in service. Retirement and death In retirement, Nicholson was a resident of Washington, DC. In September 1920, he was elected president of the Army and Navy Club of America. In February 1927, his brigadier general's rank was restored by a special act of Congress. Nicholson died in Washington on December 20, 1931. His funeral took place at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle. Nicholson was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Awards and decorations In 1919, Georgetown University awarded Nicholson the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D.). In addition to the Distinguished Service Cross for his heroism at Montfaucon, Nicholson received the Distinguished Service Medal to recognize his superior service during World War I. He also received the Legion of Honor (Officer) and Croix de Guerre from France. =Distinguished Service Cross Citation= The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Brigadier General William Jones Nicholson, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in action while Commanding the 157th Infantry Brigade, 79th Division, A.E.F., near the Bois-de-Beuge, Montfaucon, France, 29 September 1918. General Nicholson established and maintained his brigade post of command on an exposed elevation near the Bois-de-Beuge, in order that he might effectively direct the attack of his brigade upon the Madeleine Farm and its surrounding woods. Realizing the important of increased artillery support, he personally visited the division post of command behind Montfaucon to seek such support. In his absence the brigade post of command open to enemy observation was swept by a concentration of enemy machine-gun fire and artillery fire. In the face of this terrific fire General Nicholson, with great coolness and with complete disregard for his own safety, rode forward on horseback to his brigade post of command to issue orders for the renewed attack upon the Madeleine Farm, supervising the formation for attack, and by his brave and gallant example inspired the men of his command with renewed courage and determination, which enabled them to reach their objective and hold it against repeated enemy counterattacks. Service: Army Rank: Brigadier General Division: 79th Division, American Expeditionary Forces General Orders: War Department, General Orders No. 15 (1923) Family In 1883, Nicholson married Harriet Fenlon (1863-1940) of Wichita, Kansas. They were the parents of two children, William Corcoran Fenlon Nicholson (1883-1962) and Helen Lispenard Nicholson Crean (1893-1986).

Huayu Lighthouse (Hua Islet Lighthouse) was built in 1939 as part of Japanese military planning for the area. The handover of Taiwan to the Republic of China occurred in 1945. Huayu Village () was established in 1946. On December 3, 2018, fishing ships from China were caught in Taiwanese waters near Hua Islet. Residents on the island originally used a deep well for water. Over time, the well has dried up and a seawater desalination plant was built in 2019. On August 11, 2019, the desalination plant failed, leading to complaints from the residents. The plant was restored to normal operation by August 20. On the afternoon of October 5, 2019, an unnamed ship from China was caught violating Taiwanese waters to the northwest of Hua Islet.

Life  Ulrich descended from the House of Sax who had property in eastern Switzerland. He was the son of Albrecht von Sax. After his studies in Paris and Bologna, he became portarius (en. \\"doorman\\") in Saint Gall and was elected abbot on 18 December 1204. Ulrich probably received the jura regalia from King Philip. He supported his brother Heinrich in his battle against Hugo I of Montfort. Ulrich awarded his brother Heinrich the bailiwick over the abbey, which we had accroached after Philip's death. However, after Otto IV had established himself as king, Ulrich's brother had to release the bailiwick again. In 1208, a dispute arose with Werner von Staufen, the Bishop of Konstanz, concerning Castle Rheineck. The dispute ended with Ulrich's defeat at Breitfeld. The chapel on the former battle field commemorates the bloodshed. When Frederick II from the Hohenstaufen family moved to Germany in 1212, Ulrich met him and accompanied him to Basel. From then on, he is often found in proximity to Frederick. Ulrich was in charge of Frederick's legation to Pope Innocent III who assigned him the right of wearing the mitre. In 1217, Honorius III endowed him with the right to mitre and ring. Several times, Ulrich was appointed referee by the Pope in church disputes. He expanded the abbey's rule. Together with his brother Heinrich, he built Clanx Castle and he also displayed extensive construction activity in Saint Gall by building a maternity home for poor women. Ulrich was preparing to go to Italy with Frederick II, when he died of a fever in 1220.  References  * Bless-Grabher, Magdalen. 2011: \\"Ulrich von Sax\\".

History After the architect Roderich Fick had expanded the house Wachenfeld to the Berghof for Hitler in 1936, Martin Bormann commissioned him to construct the tea house on Mooslahnerkopf not far from the domicile on Obersalzberg. In the catalog of works, however, it is listed as a \\"teahouse on Moslahnerkopf\\" as well as in the architectural plans and in the memories of Eva Braun . The cylindrical teahouse was built in 1937 and was Hitler's favorite destination, which he in contrast to Kehlsteinhaus used nearly every afternoon. On April 25, 1945, the area on the Obersalzberg was attacked by the Royal Air Force. The teahouse was not hit. The house was destroyed and demolished by the Americans in 1951-1952, to prevent it being used as a memorial to Hitler. Location and appearance The teahouse was built directly on the hillside, a foothill of the Hoher G√∂ll. The central basement had a diameter of 9 meters and was illuminated by three large windows, which also allowed a limited panoramic view in the Berchtesgadener basin. Also power supply, water connection and a sewer had been thought. The entrance to the round teahouse was on the hillside. In the middle stood a circular table, arranged around the upholstered armchair. There was additional seating around the central furniture. The rotunda was followed by a 12-meter-long, hexagonal farm building. In the further area - not visible to guests hidden in the surrounding forest - there were single-person air raid shelters and buildings for the guards. Daily ritual Hitler made the 20 minute walk from the Berghof to the teahouse with his dog Blondi, closest friends and associates. After having tea, coffee and cakes Hitler often fell asleep and was driven back to the Berghof by car. The others had to go back by foot. Post-war ruins The remains that were near a golf course (hole 13) were finally removed in August 2006 by order of the Bavarian Government, after the establishment of the Kempinski Hotel Berchtesgaden (originally the InterContinental and now the Kempinski Hotel Berchtesgaden)Die Geheimnisse der Alpenfestung. Today nothing remains of the buildings, but the panoramic view point still exists. It was rebuilt for a movie about Albert Speer and Hitler.

He developed a new form of dry battery that enabled him to build, in 1888, an electric bus that he ran successfully for at least . In March 1894 he built an electric parcel van that was used in central London and later developed electric private cars. Bersey also developed an electric cab design, 75 of which were built and used by the London Electrical Cab Company to run a service between 1897 and 1899. They were not financially successful owing to noise and vibration leading to excessive damage to tyres and batteries. In his later career Bersey developed designs for internal combustion engine cars and during the First World War served with the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force.  Early life and inventing career  Bersey was born on 15 October 1874. He studies at the Finsbury College of Engineering, attending courses given by physicist and electrical engineer Silvanus P. Thompson. Early in life he developed a new type of dry battery that allowed him to construct a working electric bus in 1888. By mid-August 1894 he had run the bus successfully over a distance of . In March of that year Bersey had developed an electric parcel van for use in the City of London. This had an effective range of and running costs said to be half that of a horse-drawn van. The prototype covered in the following 11 months and was well received in the press; though it was derided as dangerous by crossing sweepers, bus and cab drivers. Bersey constructed his first electric car in 1895; this was a two-motor chain-driven design with a 2-speed clutch gearbox. Bersey exhibited a vehicle at the International Horseless Carriage Exhibition at the Imperial Institute on 15 May 1896, it was described as \\"smooth but slow\\". Bersey designed a number of such electric vehicles for the private motorist, though none survived to the modern day. Bersey noted at the time that \\"there is no apparent limit to the hopes and expectations of the electric artisans‚Ä¶..in short [it] is the natural power which shall be the most intimate and effective of all man's assets\\". Bersey became an Associate Member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in December 1895 and in 1896 he issued a publication entitled ‚ÄòElectrically Propelled Carriages‚Äô which featured several electrically propelled carriages, designed by Bersey and as well as carriages by other manufacturers. Bersey fell foul of the restrictive Locomotive Acts of the time which limited self- propelled road-going vehicles to 2 mph in towns and 4 mph in the countryside. They also required all such vehicles to be preceded by a man waving a red flag. Bersey was summonsed to court at least twice for breaking the law, by exceeding the speed limit and not having a flag man. In May 1896 he was fined ¬£2 plus costs for driving on Parliament Street, London, in excess of the speed limit. The Locomotive Acts were superseded, after much lobbying and campaigning, by the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 on 14 November 1896 which removed the requirement for a flag man and raised the speed limit to 12 mph. At around this time Bersey predicted that \\"whilst petroleum may become the motive power in country districts, and steam will probably be used for very heavy vehicles, there is no doubt that electricity will be the most advantageous where the traffic can be located within a radius\\".  Bersey electric cab  thumb In 1896 Bersey developed an electric taxi cab, intended for use in central London. The cab was exhibited at a South Kensington motor show and the 14 November 1896 London to Brighton emancipation race. A batch of 12 cabs entered service for the London Electrical Cab Company on 19 August 1897. The cabs, which charged the same rate as the horse-drawn alternative, proved popular and the fleet expanded to 75 vehicles. However the heavy weight of the vehicle's batteries caused excessive tyre wear, vibration and increased noise. The vibration damaged the delicate glass plate batteries and the cost of replacements for these and the solid rubber tyres caused the company to report a loss of ¬£6,200 in its first year. The cabs were withdrawn from service and the company closed in August 1899.  Later career  In his later career Bersey switched to designing and selling internal combustion engine cars. His firm of W C Bersey & Co of Hythe Road, Willesden, Middlesex, went into liquidation on 4 January 1900. He then entered into a partnership with Augustus Sebastian Pereno as a motor dealer in Long Acre, London, which lasted until 24 February 1903. A subsequent partnership with Percy Lloyd Hanmer Dodson, again as motor dealers, at Copthall Avenue, London, was dissolved on 5 October 1903. Some of his patents were later acquired by Harry John Lawson's The Great Horseless Carriage Company. During the First World War Bersey was appointed a second lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps on 29 October 1917. He was confirmed in rank as a 2nd class equipment officer on 29 November 1917 and on 15 March 1918 was appointed to the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel whilst on special employment. Bersey transferred to the Royal Air Force upon its foundation on 1 April 1918 and was appointed a 1st class staff officer. He relinquished his rank on 30 September 1918 and was appointed a temporary major in the administrative branch; he ceased to be employed on 25 April 1919 after the war had ended. Bersey died on 21 April 1950, by which point he was living at Sandbanks, Bournemouth, and left an estate valued at around ¬£9,800.

To solve the security problem in the northern half (including its Minahasa and Mongondow, mostly Christian, communities), Decree of the Chief of Staff of the Army KPTS-288/5/1957 on May 27, 1957 was enacted by then Brigadier General Abdul Haris Nasution which formed the North and Central Sulawesi Regional Military Command (Komando Daerah Militer Sulawesi Utara dan Tengah or KDM-SUT) with the 24th Infantry Regiment of the 7th Territorial Army as the basis of this region. On September 28, 1957, another decree from the office of the Chief of Staff of the Army designated Lt. Col. Inf. Daniel Julius Somba as Commandant of the KDM-SUT, and Major Inf Dolf Runturambi as Chief of Staff. On June 16, 1958, the Armed Forces executed the landing operation codenamed Operation Independence (Operasi Merdeka) on the Kema Minahasa Coast with the landing forces of around 4,000 servicemen of the Army being led by Lt. Col. (INF) Roekmito Hendraningrat. On 26 June 1958 the city of Manado was captured. On 21 July 1958 Tondano fell followed the fall of Tomohon, the powerhouse of Permesta at that time, on August 16, 1958 due to the betrayal of Major Mongdong of the rebel forces. The campaign against the Permesta rebellion would last two years, ending with the surrender of all rebel soldiers in 1960-61. On February 12, 1985, Army Chief of Staff General TNI Rudini issued a decree Number: SKEP / 131/11/1985 concerning the merger of both Kodam XIII/Merdeka and Kodam XIV/Hasanuddin to form one super region.

Warner House, on S. Mill Creek Dr. in Moab, Utah, was built around 1890. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. The two-story adobe house was built about ten years after its builder, O.W. Warner, arrived in Moab. Warner was born in Sepacuel, New York, in 1839. \\"O. W. came to Utah with his family and settled in Fillmore in 1851. Capitalizing on the experience with his father and older brothers in operating saw mills in the Fillmore area, Orlando built first a saw mill and later a grist mill after his arrival in the Moab area. During the winter of 1881 he was awarded a contract to build a section of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad grade through Grand County. After moving his family to Moab in 1881, they lived first in a dugout then a log cabin until the present two-story adobe house was completed. The house and grounds Were used for celebrations, especially Independence Day and the 24th of July, the date celebrating the arrival of the first Mormon pioneers in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. A platform was constructed on top of the apple cellar and was used during the summer for community dances. Mr. Warner was a leader in the development of Moab's fruit industry. When he brought his family to Moab in 1881 he brought many fruit trees which he not only planted himself but distributed to other Moab settlers. The Warner orchards produced apples, peaches, and pears.\\" The fruit trees were later taken out in favor of using the land for pasturage. A fruit warehouse, built c.1910 and located about north of the house, is a second contributing building on the property.

Trad, who lived in Zahle, was recognized for his work that often included love, women, and the beauty of Lebanon's nature, specifically, his home town Baskinta. His poems were commemorated in songs by Wadih Al-Safi, Fairouz, and Marcel Khalife. They were also translated to other languages like English and French. His work was the subject of a thesis at the Cambridge University of the United Kingdom. Michel Trad was known to be a zealous poet who honored and praised Lebanon along with its language through his work. Not only did he manage to translate his thoughts into eloquent words that emphasized an enriched Lebanese culture, but he also sought to make his work appropriate and accessible to all Lebanese citizens, prompting them to embrace the Lebanese language and its glory.  Early life  Michel Trad was born on 21 October 1912, in Zahl√©, a city in Beqaa Governorate in Lebanon, to Lebanese parents, Musa Trad and Mohiba Ayoub. At the age of six, Michel Trad, along with his mother and sister, moved into his grandparent‚Äôs house in Baskinta following the death of his father.

Career life  Michel Trad worked as a teacher in Three Moons School or Thalathat Akmar School (in Arabic ŸÖÿØÿ±ÿ≥ÿ© ÿ´ŸÑÿßÿ´ÿ© ÿ£ŸÇŸÖÿßÿ±). After that, he worked as an intern at a national library in 1939. In 1941, he joined the Directorate General of Antiquities and worked as a writer at the National Museum.

Although Trad detested being an employee there, he had both a good salary and a special transportation from Zahle to Riyaq. Not only did Trad earn 18 Lebanese pounds per month, he was also offered one of the used soldiers' bikes as a means of transportation by one of Trad's biggest fans, the army officer that supervised the co-op. Even though Trad had a good salary and a decent ride to and from work, he detested being an employee and had always thought that 'the devil of money was seducing him with the 18 Lebanese pounds that he used to earn. Trad's income was considered to be large back then. Nevertheless, he did not fail to waste it which left him with only little money to last him until the end of the month. He used to spend the 15 Lebanese pounds accordingly: 4 Lebanese pounds on cigarettes, ,8 Lebanese pounds on drinking arak (in Arabic ÿπÿ±ŸÇ) near Berdawni, and 3 Lebanese pounds for his grandmother at home, leaving him with only 3 Lebanese pounds to sustain him. Even with his desperate need for the money, Trad believed he was capable of surviving without it and that working at the military barracks limited him and left him with little time to concentrate on his poetry. That is when it hit him that he needed to quit his job, pursue a career in writing, and consequently, fulfill his destiny.
