He first visited New Zealand as a young man where he farmed and traded. In 1849 he travelled to San Francisco and took part in the Gold Rush as a trader in the mining camps. Eventually, having made his fortune out of the mining industry, he moved to Marysville, California, where he became a Levee Commissioner, landowner and President of the informal anti-mining activist group, the Anti-Debris Association, which was concerned with protecting landowner rights. He built some of the most important buildings in the city, one of which housed the Appeal newspaper, now known as the Appeal-Democrat.  Biography  Charles E. Sexey was born in London in March 1818. His surname is unusual and the name can be traced mostly to the Hampshire/Dorset area of England. The most famous person bearing this surname is Hugh Sexey of Bruton, Somerset, an auditor for Queen Elizabeth I.  New Zealand  In an account recorded on 17 April 1935 by Mr. J. Oliphant, Sexey's daughter Elizabeth Mainwaring stated as follows: \\"This is the story of Rihi Huanga daughter of Charles Sexey a PƒÅkehƒÅ (European) who came to the Waikato in the early days, long before Morgan the Missionary. He was one of four stowaway boys, all Pakehas, who came up the Waikato from the coast. Porokora and Hakepa, two of the Waikato chiefs, adopted them.\\" Although Sexey's arrival in New Zealand has not been dated, the New Zealand Government Gazette of 1841 gave notice of a letter awaiting him at the post office. By that time, he had adopted a local name, Tiara Tikitini, and he was living in Te Awamutu. Te Awamutu was a pa, a settlement occupied by the Waikato people. They had fled there from NgƒÅpuhi at the time of the Matakitaki massacre in 1822 and were given shelter by the Ngati-Ngutu people and land at Otawhao. There a pa was built by Ngutu, son of Whaita of the Ngati-Turanga or Tainui people. This was the world of the young Charles Sexey, a pa occupied by the Waikato people, with the ministry of the Reverend Morgan, a devout Protestant and staunch anti-Catholic. According to local custom Sexey married a chief's daughter named Rihi (Rea) Tahuta and they had four children, Catherine (birth date unknown), Henry (born about 1843), Sarah (born 23 October 1846) and Elizabeth (born 26 March 1848). During the early years he is recorded as making his living as a 'flour miller'. In 1847, a Mr. Hardington of the Victoria Hotel appointed Sexey as his agent and an Auckland street directory of 1848 shows him as having a shop in Shortland Street. However, on 6 June 1849 he left New Zealand forever, leaving behind his wife and four young children. He was off to make his fortune in the goldfields of California. He sailed on the brig Fanny, which arrived in San Francisco on 29 August 1849, with Captain Francis D. Leathard in charge. On board were 42 passengers with children.  Mining prosperity  Sexey set up as a trader in gold mining towns. Gold had been discovered on the Yuba River in June 1848 by Jonas Spect of Pennsylvania, and by the spring of 1850 there was a population of 1,000 with six stores, eight hotels and eight or ten saloons. He was listed on the census for 1860 at Long Bar, a Yuba County mining town on the main Yuba River above the confluence with Dry Creek, near Parks Bar. The diggings there gave out in 1864. He is also listed as having a store in a mining camp, Browns Valley.  Marysville  By 1863 he was on his way to becoming a property developer as evidenced by a newspaper reference to \\"a building Charles Sexey will erect on D Street.\\" This was the Tremont Block on the corner of 2nd Street and Maiden Lane. Etchings of the place show a massive construction that was to house the Appeal Steam Printing House, the Daily and Weekly Appeal, F. Buttleman & Co, Wholesale and Retail Licquor Dealers and W.L. Lawrence, Harness and Saddlery. In 1864 at the Catholic Church in Marysville, Sexey married Jane Frances O‚ÄôDonnell, born in Ardare, County Donegal, Ireland. She was aged 26 and a devout Catholic. Sexey went on to become one of the seven trustees of the local woollen mill, a highly successful venture incorporated in the spring of 1867 with a capital stock of $50,000. By the time of the 1870 census he is noted as being a 46-year-old Englishman with a 32-year-old wife and a young Chinese cook. His assets are $80,000 with $20,000 in real estate. He is recorded as resident at 5th near the corner of Maiden Lane. There are many records during these years of his buying and selling property in Marysville, such as on 28 January 1870 at 2:20 PM, he purchased the famous 'Ramirez Castle' for $4,125 in gold coin. In spite of the high cost he and Jane never lived in the house. By 1870, it is said he \\"enjoyed a comfortable standard of living from the wise investments he chose.\\" A lithograph shows his home as being built of brick, quite large and occupying a substantial corner site. Charles Sexey was naturalised as an American citizen on 3 November 1876, with registration of same not taking place until June 1880. The Marysville Appeal Directory of 1878-79 reported that Charles Sexey was a Levee Commissioner born in England who held of land. William Turner Ellis Jr, a levee commissioner appointed in 1900, wroteEllis, W.T., My 72 years in the Romantic County of Yuba, California, 1939 of an event when the dam broke and raging waters hurled towards Marysville. A telegram was sent to \\"the mayor or Charles Sexey\\" giving news of the imminent danger. Sexey and several others raced to the town to give warning. However, the flood was averted because the levee on the south bank of the Yuba River had broken, allowing water and debris to run through the township of Linda to the Feather River as other floods had done before. First appointed a director in August 1881 and having served for at least three years, (Democrat, 15 April 1886) as president, he resigned the Anti-Debris Association on 3 May 1887, saying that the duties of the office were \\"onerous\\" and his health had been greatly impaired. The Board refused to accept his resignation; nevertheless, he insisted and left on a year-long trip to Europe. On 24 July 1888, he caught a chill during a trip to Oban in Scotland and died.  Sexey estate  For the purposes of probate the estate was appraised at $100,000 and included stock in the San Francisco Gas Light Company, California Insurance Company, California Electric Company, Spring Valley Water Company, and the Bank of California. In addition to this he was a stockholder in the Marysville Woollen Mill, and had both business and residential property in Marysville. His widow Jane lived on for approximately eight years. During this time she spent time in San Francisco as a semi-permanent guest at Lick House, an expensive and fashionable hotel, and it is there she died in late August 1896. It was reported that the deceased had no known relatives and that her money was left to charitable institutions. On 10 December 1897 Charles, who had died in Scotland, and his wife Jane who had died in America were 'laid to rest in one mound' in Oakland, California according to Jane's wishes. Charles Sexey's four children in New Zealand never received a penny of their father's wealth or ever derived any benefit from it.

History 250px March of the Volunteers, now China's national anthem, was released by Path√© Shanghai in 1935 Around the beginning of the 20th century, a young Frenchman named Labansat set up an outdoor stall on Tibet Road in Shanghai and played gramophone records to Chinese citizens who were curious.

The company initially recorded Peking Opera. Mandarin popular songs became hits, and they were sold at stores like Wing On in Shanghai. In 1930 Path√©'s factory was taken over by Columbia Records in Shanghai and was used to press Odeon and Beka with the manufacturing portion named \\"China Record Co.

In the same decade, Path√© went under British EMI, which was originally seeking to make a profit on The Bund selling gramophone records. Ren Guang became Path√©-EMI‚Äôs new director and began getting involved with leftist music devoted to the proletarian cause. In 1937 Ren was fired from the company when the leftist music was cut off by the Japanese military officials. Any Japanese plants were also taken back to the Nipponophone Company (Êó•Êú¨ËìÑÈü≥Âô®Ê†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ).

In 1952 the communists accused Path√©'s factory in Shanghai of promoting pornography, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong in China popular music produced and performed up to 1952 was denounced as Yellow Music, the color yellow became associated with pornography and pornography was made illegal. As a result of the accusation Path√© was immediately forced to stop cutting records, close down its factory and cease operations. Path√© subsequently moved its main office from Shanghai to Hong Kong and started to cut records in Hong Kong, thus restoring the glory of Shanghainese pop music in the British colony. Path√© Hong Kong faced fierce competition in the 1960s with the rise of Diamond Records and eventually ceased Shanghainese pop production and cut Cantopop instead, which gained popularity in the early 1970s. Path√© Hong Kong later changed its English name to EMI Hong Kong but retained its original Chinese name. In 2012 the entire EMI Group was broken up and sold to various companies.

Long considered lost, it was accidentally rediscovered in Uruguay in the 1990s, and almost immediately hailed as one of the greatest Chinese silent films. Like many Chinese silent films, it features both Chinese and English intertitles. Ruan Lingyu portrays two different characters, and the split screen technology is used for scenes where both characters appear. Production history Based on a novel by a Polish expatriate, S. Rosen-hoa (\\"Ho Ro-se\\"), who had married a Chinese engineer, Love and Duty became one of the first films produced by the leftist Lianhua Film Company. The film was very popular for its day, in no small part due to the pairing of Ruan, who was already a darling of the Shanghai film industry, and Jin Yan, a Korean-born actor who was one of the major leading men in early Chinese cinema. Plot The film tells the story of Yang Naifan (Ruan Lingyu) who runs from her arranged marriage to be with her true love, Li Zuyi (Jin Yan). The film details the poverty she must endure for breaking with tradition. Rediscovery For many years the film was believed lost, until a complete print was discovered in Uruguay in the 1990s. The rediscovered print was shipped over to Taiwan in 1993 and is now housed at the Taiwan Film and Audiovisual Institute. Since its rediscovery, the film has made its rounds in film festivals and Chinese cinema retrospectives around the world. In 2014, Love and Duty underwent a 2K digital restoration under Italy's L'Immagine Ritrovata, after which it was screened at the Shanghai Film Festival that same year. Remakes Love and Duty has been remade twice, in 1938 and 1955. The first was from the wartime Shanghai \\"Orphan Island\\" studio Xinhua Film Company, again directed by Bu Wancang, with Jin Yan reprising his earlier role and Yuan Meiyun in the role originally created by Ruan Lingyu. The second remake was by the Hong Kong Shaw Brothers Studio. Both remakes were Mandarin dialect sound films.

He was a Congregational and Presbyterian Minister, and a joint founder of the Historical Society of New South Wales. A portrait of Arthur Aspinall is found in Cameron's Centenary History, p320, Plate 99. Educational qualifications Arthur's initial occupation is unknown. He was trained by private tutors, particularly Primitive Methodist minister Miles Moss, and Barzillai Quaife who, like Arthur and his family, was a close friend of the Reverend John Dunmore Lang. It is also known that serious illness (possibly typhoid (or scarlet fever: ADB)) interrupted his studies. Camden College rejected Arthur's initial application to train as a minister because he was softly-spoken, a difficulty he overcame with training. Eventually Arthur trained at the University of Sydney and at Camden Theological College (1868‚Äì1871), to become a Minister of Religion in the Congregational Church. He earned a B.A. with distinction. Before he had completed his training Arthur decided to move to the Presbyterian Church. This change of allegiance was undoubtedly influenced, even encouraged, by John Dunmore Lang. This change also meant that Arthur was required to repay his tuition fees for his earlier training by the Congregational Church. He was ordained and inducted at Forbes (which had just become a new parish) in 1873. Just before his retirement from the position of Principal of the Scots College, Sydney, Arthur obtained a master's degree in history from the University of Sydney. Early ministry As a student, Arthur preached to the Congregational gathering in Marrickvile at the home of Thomas Holt MLC(1871‚Äì1872). When their church was built (now the Roseby Memorial Church) Arthur, though still a student, was appointed as the first minister. He did not complete his training when he decided to switch his allegiance to the Presbyterian Church. Arthur's first appointment to a Presbyterian ministry in 1874 was based at Forbes. His parish covered a vast area between the Lachlan and Bogan Rivers. At least twice a year Arthur would make a month-long journey on horseback to visit the many squatters in the district. During these visits services were held, children were baptised, couples were married and prayers were finally said for the dead who had been buried since his last visit. He left this parish in 1887 to return to Sydney. The Scots College The well-educated minister saw a need to provide an education in Sydney for the children of these pastoralists at a price which they could afford. Arthur returned to a ministry in Sydney in 1887 and took up an appointment at the St Lukes, Redfern church (1887‚Äì1893). Initially the family lived near the church. From 1890 to 1892 they lived in a large house on a large block of land that they had purchased at Unwin's Bridge Road Marrickville (now Tempe). It is thought that the original intention was to start the school in this building. Then Thomas Saywell offered the Church the use of the de-licensed Brighton-le-Sands hotel for the proposed boarding school. Necessary changes were made to the hotel by Arthur's brother, Albert Aspinall, a builder. When The Scots College was officially opened on 28 January 1893 with the sons of his friends from the Forbes circuit as boarders Arthur's dream had been fulfilled. Much of the money to establish the school had come from his wife's family. They and another family then purchased the house in Tempe from the Rev. Aspinall. Arthur remained as the Principal of the school until he retired in 1913. Ashworth, as Arthur preferred to be called, was a tough, unpopular disciplinarian. Small transgressions by his children and students resulted in harsh punishments. (This aspect of Ashworth's personality is expanded elsewhere: see references.) Behind his back, even after retirement, Ashworth, was called \\"The Old Tosh\\" by friends and family as well as by his students. As a tribute to Arthur, one of Scots's boarding houses (Aspinall) is named after him. Background and family Arthur was born in Southowram, West Riding of Yorkshire, England and died in Turramurra, a suburb of Sydney, NSW, Australia. His ashes are interred in the family grave at the South Head Cemetery, Waverley. His family left Southowram in 1851 and settled in Aston-under-Lynne, Lancashire (about 20 km east of Manchester). He came to Australia in 1857 with his parents, John Aspinall and Sarah (n√©e Ingham) and siblings (including Albert), aboard the Mary Ann. The Mary Ann left Southampton, England on 27 November 1856 and arrived in Sydney, Australia on 19 March 1857 [SMH]. The family lived at 9 Arundel Terrace, Parramatta Road, Bishopthorpe, opposite Sydney University. In 1877 he married Helen Strahorn (daughter of pastoralist John Strahorn of Wandoo Wandong station, Obley, NSW). They had seven children the first two of whom, possibly twins, were never registered and died very young. The other five children became doctors, with his daughter Jessie Aspinall becoming the first female junior medical resident at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. After his retirement Arthur and his family still living at home moved to St Killians, 6 Challis Avenue, Potts Point (named after the original building of The Scots College in Bellevue Hill). His wife died during a trip to England in 1915. About 1919 Arthur moved to Eastwood for a short period, leaving his daughter, Jessie, and family to continue to live in the house for many years. In the early 1920s Arthur bought a house and of land at Trentino Avenue, Turramurra, a property which remained in the family for many years. Arthur named the property \\"Morita\\" after his Japanese live-in servant. Eventually Arthur developed senility from which he died. In his confused state of mind he destroyed many of his personal papers and documents of archival value to both the Church and to the Historical Society of New South Wales of which he was a founding member. When Arthur entered Camden College he was a member of the congregation of the Pitt Street Congregational Church, Sydney.

Steele delivering a speech in an auditorium - Tallahassee, Florida. Charles Kenzie Steele (born in McDowell County, West Virginia; died in Tallahassee, Florida) was a preacher and a civil rights activist. He was one of the main organizers of the 1956 Tallahassee bus boycott, and a prominent member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. On March 23, 2018, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed CS/SB 382 into law, designating portions of Florida State Road 371 and Florida State Road 373 along Orange Avenue in Tallahassee as C.K. Steele Memorial Highway. Background Steele was the son of a coal miner, an only child. At a young age, he knew that he wanted to be a preacher, and he started preaching when he was 15 years old. Steele graduated from Morehouse College in 1938. He then began preaching in Toccoa and Augusta, Georgia, then in Montgomery, Alabama, at the Hall Street Baptist Church (1938‚Äì1952). In 1952 Steele moved to Tallahassee, where he started preaching at the Bethel Missionary Baptist Church. Steele met Martin Luther King Jr. when he was on his way to Tallahassee. Tallahassee bus boycott Steele at the Capitol for silent vigil supporting government aid to the poor in 1968. The Tallahassee bus boycott began in May, 1956, during the Montgomery bus boycott. Like other bus boycotts during the Civil Rights Movement in America, it started because black people were forced to ride in the back of the bus, and when two students refused to give up their seat to a white woman, they were arrested. An organization was formed to protest and boycott against the city bus system. The organization was called Inter-civic Council and Steele was elected president. Steele and other protesters boycotted the system by starting car pools and the bus system had stopped for the first time in 17 years on July 1. Steele was arrested many times during this period. The people in Tallahassee thought that the protesters' demands were outrageous. Steele and the other protesters met a lot of rich and influential opposition. The Ku Klux Klan burned a cross in front of Steele's church, marched in front of his house, and threw bottles through his windows. The city commissioners were firmly opposed to integration of the buses. The bus system was integrated two years later. He was also the lead plaintiff in the school desegregation suit, which led to the desegregation of public schools in Leon County. Steele was also a part of many other protests, marches, and boycotts, where he helped to accomplish integration in many public places. Steele helped Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. organize the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in 1957. He was made the First Vice President under Dr. King at the time of the formation of SCLC. Steele participated in the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965. Steele died from bone marrow cancer in 1980 at the age of 66 in Tallahassee. Legacy When the city created a new bus terminal in 1983, it was named after Steele and a statue of him (by sculptor David Lowe) was placed on the NE corner of the terminal. Florida State University conferred on Steele the honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree in 1980‚Äîthe first to an African American, and the first to be bestowed in fifty-six years from that school. The Bethel Baptist Church in Tallahassee, where Steele was a pastor for twenty-eight years, has established a charter school which is named in his and former Governor Leroy Collins' honor: the Steele-Collins Charter School. In 2012 Steele was inducted into the Florida Civil Rights Hall of Fame. On March 23, 2018, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed CS/SB 382 into law, designating portions of Florida State Road 371 and Florida State Road 373 along Orange Avenue in Tallahassee as C.K.

The museum is located in the village of Aldwarke, part of Rotherham. In addition to buses, the museum also features the lower deck of a former Sheffield Tramway tramcar, a tractor, a lorry, milk floats and an extensive array of bicycles plus static displays of models and memorabilia. About SYTM The museum moved to its present location in 2007, when it also changed its name. Since late 2009 there are two units: bay 8 and bay 9. Monthly open days take place on the second Sunday each month when visitors can view the vehicles and displays in both units. Some of the open days during the year feature a particular theme such as a Bus Running Day in May, Models Exhibition in June and the Annual South Yorkshire Transport Rally in September. History Keith Beeden was one of the founding fathers of the bus preservation movement in Sheffield and has been a mainstay of the development of the Museum from a small set of schoolboys in the late 1960s to a full- fledged and respected Transport Museum today. Here he tells the story up to Easter 2007 in his own words. The SHEFFIELD BUS MUSEUM TRUST opened the Transport Museum at the Tinsley Tram Sheds in 1987. The origins of the SBMT were actually much earlier, when schoolboys at High Storrs Grammar School became interested in the local transport scene. By the late sixties a 1946 vintage Leyland PD1 double deck bus had been purchased by a group that was the nucleus of the Sheffield Omnibus Enthusiasts Society, the aim of which was to preserve an old bus. Thus was the local area interest in the conservation of historical vehicles formed. Together with the South Yorkshire Transport Group (later renamed SYT Society) the two entities combined their interests with the aim of developing a local bus collection policy. From the efforts of various individuals in association with the two parties, a variety of vehicles formerly operated by the Sheffield, Rotherham and North East Derbyshire operators were brought together. They consisted of both single and double deck buses, even including a Rotherham double deck trolleybus. The vehicles were kept on an open site in a building suppliers yard at Heeley. In order to formalise the vehicle collection policy, the Sheffield Bus Preservation Circle was inaugurated. The South Yorkshire PTE recruited a new Public Relations Officer, named Bruce Hugman. He was extremely interested in the local preservation scene, and quickly made himself known, with some exciting ideas to contribute. Bruce was instrumental in a link with the South Yorkshire Railway Society, bringing another group interested in local transport matters. This broader emphasis, now including rail interests, led to a change of title for the content of the collection, to come into line, the SBPC now became the South Yorkshire Transport Collection, with the aim of formulating a transport collection, on a suitable site to form a museum for public appreciation. Problems ensued when the Wilkinson‚Äôs builders yard had to be vacated at short notice and this led to a dispersal of the collection, as a temporary measure. The trolleybus went to Sandtoft, a bus went to nearby Haxey and some were exiled to Co. Durham and Merseyside. A few did remain in the Sheffield area, but the situation was quite unsatisfactory. At this juncture, the future of the collection was in doubt and an intensive search for alternative accommodation was set in motion. Bruce Hugman succeeded in persuading Sheffield Council to provide an unused building at the Kelham Island Industrial Museum. With a great sense of relief and jubilation, the dispersed fleet of local vehicles was moved into the new site. First of all came the single deckers, as the single entrance at Kelham was not of sufficient height to admit a double-decker. We agreed to share the cost of the alterations to the door, to admit higher vehicles, so that shortly after, the double-decker fleet could be moved in. This happy state of affairs did not last for long: the Kelham management decided to use our section for an expansion project of its own. After ten months residence, the vehicle collection was again in need of a new home and the feverish search for a new site was again set in motion. Our South Yorkshire Railway associates offered a joint proposal to occupy part of the Newton Chambers site at Chapeltown. An appraisal of the intended site was to reveal that there were possibilities in the joint operation of a Rail and Road transport venture at Chapeltown. Therefore, with the assistance of officials and employees of SYPTE, another transfer from Kelham Island was pursued, to occupy our new base at Newton Chambers, in 1985. The arrangement with SYRS proved to be quite unsatisfactory, for among other problems, the whole site was to be re-developed as an Industrial Estate. Once again a withdrawal was put in hand and the vehicles dispersed, with local operators, including Richardson Travel and South Yorkshire Transport, offering accommodation for some buses in the period up to deregulation. At this point, our morale was at a low ebb, for the continued existence of the collection was in serious doubt. With a last determined push a thoroughly intensive effort was made by the senior members to resolve this recurring problem. Premises for lease were inspected which included the B& C Co-operative site at Attercliffe, a site at Green Lane Ecclesfield and premises on Bridge Street, Sheffield, for various reasons, all were rejected. Finally, a chance to view the Tinsley Tram Sheds premises at the junction of Weedon Street Attercliffe Common was presented. Built in 1873-4 for the Sheffield Tramways Company and taken over by Sheffield Corporation in 1896 and extended in 1900, this historic site seemed to fulfil the needs required by a transport collection. Its great age was a problem, but an inspection seemed to support the view that the condition of the building was reasonable, and a long 25-year lease was available. Eventually, Bay 3 was made available for occupancy and discussions with the various parties resulted in the appointment of five Trustee/ Guarantors to sign the lease. With a few modifications and a repair to the main door, the collection of vehicles was moved in stages to the new, permanent home. The five Trustees of the Sheffield Bus Museum Trust (a charity) were also Guarantors of the lease and later Directors of SBMT Ltd (a company limited by guarantee). They bore personal financial liability for the rent payable to the Landlord: a responsibility that weighed heavily upon them. Without these men (Keith Beeden, Mike Greenwood, David Roberts, David Tummon and Eric Wilson) all the positive developments that have led to the present situation could not have taken place. (Ed.) From early in the new regime, problems of flooding were to be a constant feature and a gradual deterioration of the main structure and roof assembly, over a number of years, with little maintenance carried out by the Landlord‚Äôs, led to a generally run down building. The lease conditions did not permit an early release from the contract, so that little could be done to move away. Storm damage and the theft of lead from the roof in 2006, rendered an intolerable atmosphere of dereliction and decrepitude, making the premises unfit for purpose. The Landlords made an abortive attempt to effect roofing repairs, but in the event no contractor was prepared to carry out such work. At this stage, with the fifth and final portion of the lease due, the Directors/ Guarantors were offered the termination of the lease ‚Äì without financial penalty. After the relevant discussions, all parties agreed to this termination plan. The first event day was celebrated at Easter 2007, when the new premises (now termed the SOUTH YORKSHIRE TRANSPORT MUSEUM) were opened to the general public. This first event day attracted a large audience of local people.

Early life and education Sellschop was born in Luderitz, Namibia on 8 June 1930. He was educated at University of Pretoria (B.Sc) and Stellenbosch University (M.Sc), and earned a PhD in Nuclear Physics at University of Cambridge. On completing his education in England, he returned to South Africa on the advice of Basil Schonland, his mentor. Contributions to neutrino research In February 1965, Sellschop was part of a group which identified the first neutrino found in nature, in one of South Africa's gold mines. The experiment was performed in a specially prepared chamber at a depth of 3 km in the ERPM mine near Boksburg. A plaque in the main building commemorates the discovery. The experiments also implemented a primitive neutrino astronomy and looked at issues of neutrino physics and weak interactions. Contributions in diamond physics Sellschop was an expert in the physics of diamonds. His research here was very broad. As a member of the CERN NA43 and NA59 collaborations, he contributed to experiments that used the perfect and very rigid diamond lattice to produce and study the highest energy near monochromatic photons ever produced in a laboratory. He was an important contributor to the field of nuclear geochemistry in diamond, evidencing the trace-element composition of natural diamond and linking this to mantle geochemistry. Diamonds are seen as \\"messengers from the deep\\", assumed to bring included mantle material to the surface well preserved in a chemical and physical prison. He also studied ion-implantation of diamond and was a pioneer of diamond as an ideal material for electrical and optical applications. He received the Max Planck medal for his work in both neutrino and diamond physics. Contributions to the scientific community Friedel Sellschop is remembered as an innovative and visionary scientific leader. He contributed both to his university and country. From 1959 to 1988, Sellschop served as the University of Witwatersrand's chair of Nuclear Physics, the first person to hold such a chair in all of South Africa. In this capacity, as a young man, he began from nothing and developed a significant nuclear physics laboratory and research department. He was therefore the founding director of the Nuclear Physics Research Unit at the University of Witwatersrand in 1956. This laboratory was later renamed the Schonland Centre for Nuclear Sciences. In 2005, the Schonland Centre was donated to the state to be run as a National Facility by iThemba LABS. Sellschop was Dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of the Witwatersrand from 1979 to 1983. He subsequently became Deputy Vice Chancellor (Research) from 1984 to 1996. In this position, from which he retired, Sellschop assisted in creating funding policies and procedures that would ensure transparency in awarding research money.

The band is notable as the participant of the Artistiƒçka radna akcija project in 1981. In 1982, the band members formed an ad hoc group Berliner Strasse (Berlin Street), influenced by post-punk and krautrock, performing songs with lyrics in the German language.  History  Initially named Punkreteni (Punkmorons), the teenage band existed for less than two years during the early 1980s. Punkreteni consisted of Branko Rosiƒá (bass), Vladimir Arsenijeviƒá (guitar), Zoran \\"Cane\\" Kostiƒá (vocals) and Slobodan \\"Loka\\" Ne≈°oviƒá (guitar). All band members were between the ages of 13 and 15. After a few weeks the band changed its name to Urbana Gerila. Ne≈°oviƒá soon left to form his own group called Defektno Efektni. Featuring raw sound and drawing lyrical inspiration from, among other things, the events surrounding the activity of terrorist groups such as the Baader-Meinhof Group,Nedjeljom u 2: Vladimir Arsenijeviƒá;HRT, 13 November 2011 Urbana Gerila had its first live performance as part of an event called Palilula Culture Olympics, in 1980, which was one of the first punk performances in Belgrade. Later, the band became a cult attraction, managing to sell out a Zagreb venue Lapidarij despite not having any recordings. The band's two tracks, \\"Proces\\" (\\"The Trial\\") and \\"Bez naslova\\" (\\"Untitled\\") were released on the Artistiƒçka radna akcija (Artistic Work Action) various artists compilation in late 1981, on which Ne≈°oviƒá's Defekno Efektni also appeared. The band performed two more songs, \\"Beograd\\" (\\"Belgrade\\") and \\"Ipak bojim se rata\\" (\\"Still, I'm Afraid of the War\\"), written before Ne≈°oviƒá's departure, however, they were never released. After the compilation release, the band moved towards playing post- punk, influenced by Joy Division and Bauhaus, with the vocalist Branislav \\"Kebra\\" Babiƒá, which was not well received by the audience. In 1981, the band performed as an opening act for the Rijeka band Paraf at the Belgrade SKC, before which Rosiƒá and Arsenijeviƒá decided to form an ad hoc band Berliner Strasse with the idea of various vocalists singing in different languages, but for the concert keeping only Petar \\"ƒÜirilo\\" Iliƒá who could speak and sing in German language, afterward becoming a full-time member. Berliner Strasse, influenced by the British post-punk and gothic rock scene and the German krautrock scene, performed songs with lyrics in German language but later on in Serbian language as well. They were later joined by Milan Ivanus on violin and Ne≈°oviƒá whose Defekno Efektni disbanded, which was also the case with Urbana Gerila. In February 1983, the song \\"1923\\" appeared on sixth place of the first Ventilator 202 demo top 10 list, but the song recording had never been released. During the same year, as Berlinen Strasse, with the song \\"Maske\\" (\\"Masks\\"), the band appeared on the various artists compilation Ventilator 202 demo top 10. The band also appeared in the movie Ne≈°to izmeƒëu (Something in Between) in which Iliƒá played the drummer of the band, performing the unreleased song \\"Achtung America\\". After Branko Rosiƒá left the serve the Yugoslav People's Army, the line up had changed, featuring various members including Marina Vuliƒá (bass) from Elektriƒçni Orgazam, and Slobodan Staniƒá and Ljubodrag Bubalo on synthesizers from the band Beograd. Berliner Strasse performed until 1984 when they disbanded.  Post-breakup  Urbana Gerila core consisted of Branko Rosiƒá, later to become journalist, and Vladimir Arsenijeviƒá, later to become award-winning and internationally acclaimed writer-novelist as well as co-founder and editor of the publishing house Rende. He is also the founder of the Krokodil Literary Festival. After leaving Urbana Gerila, Zoran Kostiƒá joined Radniƒçka Kontrola, another band featured on the Artistiƒçka radna akcija compilation. In 1982, he became a frontman of the highly popular garage rock band Partibrejkers. Urbana Gerila various lineups included Uro≈° ƒêuriƒá, later painter and occasional actor, Slobodan \\"Loka\\" Ne≈°oviƒá, later founder of Automatik Records company, Branislav \\"Kebra\\" Babiƒá, later frontman of Obojeni Program, Nenad \\"Kele\\" Krasavac, later the founding member of Disciplina Kiƒçme, and Dragoslav \\"Dra≈æa\\" Radojkoviƒá, later member of Laibach and Kazimirov Kazneni Korpus.  Legacy  In 1998, the various artists compilation Ventilator 202 vol. 1, featuring the Berliner Strasse song \\"Maske\\", appeared on the 100th place on the 100 greatest Yugoslav popular music albums list, released in the book YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike (YU 100: The Best albums of Yugoslav pop and rock music).

In some students this manifests as an outright fear of libraries and the librarians who work there.\\" The term stems from a 1986 article by Constance Mellon, a professor of library science in the U.S. state of North Carolina, titled \\"Library anxiety: A grounded theory and its development\\" in the College & Research Libraries journal.  Background  When Mellon published her article in 1986, the term \\"library anxiety\\" was new, but the phenomenon had been observed and reported by previous library researchers. In 1972, Mary Jane Swope and Jeffrey Katzer discovered, through interviews, that students at their university were intimidated by the library and afraid to seek help from library personnel. In 1982, Geza Kosa surveyed university students in Australia and found similar results. None of these researchers had a specific term to apply to the phenomenon they were seeing until Mellon's study. Mellon's landmark two-year qualitative research study, which included 6,000 students at a Southern university in the United States, found that 75 to 85 percent described their initial response to library research in terms of fear. Mellon used the term \\"library anxiety\\" to describe the feelings of discomfort and fear a group of undergraduate English composition students described when they were starting an information search that required using the academic library. The study revealed four primary reasons to explain feelings of library anxiety. The students: *were intimidated by the size of the library, *lacked knowledge about where everything was located, *lacked knowledge about how to begin the research process, and *lacked knowledge about what to do. Mellon further discovered that these negative feelings often overwhelmed students to the point that they could not function effectively in the library. It was found that they had a feeling of inferiority when they compared their library skills to those of other students, and that these feelings of inadequacy were a source of shame that made them hesitant to ask library staff for help. Mellon alerted faculty members outside the library that these behaviors constituted problems that needed to be addressed. She likened library anxiety to mathematical anxiety and test anxiety. She suggested that library anxiety should be recognized and the anxious person provided with experiences in which they could succeed. Mellon advocates the use of qualitative research, as it provided a deeper insight into information behavior. She comments that her study applied the rarely used methods of qualitative research to a library problem, and states that while the study was important, the implications of the research technique were far greater. She used the technique of personal writing or journal writing to collect data in which the writer is \\"talking on paper\\" with no concern for audience, style, grammar, or spelling, which allows the writer to tap into a stream of consciousness. The students' personal writing was analyzed for recurrent themes.  Impact  Ironically, despite Mellon's goal to increase the use of qualitative research methods in library science, library anxiety did not become popular as a research topic until Sharon Bostick created the Library Anxiety Scale, a quantitative tool to measure it, in 1992. Doris J. Van Kampen created a new instrument in 2004, the Multidimensional Library Anxiety Scale (MLAS), to take into account off-campus use of library resources and master's and doctoral student attitudes. Gillian S. Gremmels reexamined Mellon's work and its impact on the library profession in a 2015 article.  Later research  The rate of research on the topic increased dramatically after 1993. In a 2007 study of graduate students, Kwon, Onwuegbuzie and Alexander found that \\"weak critical thinking dispositions in the areas of self-confidence, inquisitiveness and systematicity were particularly associated with high levels of library anxiety.\\" Systematicity was defined as being disposed toward organizing, logical, focused and attentive inquiry. However, the scope of their study did not allow these findings to be generalized to undergraduates. Another study conducted in 2007 by Melissa Gross and Don Latham also attributed heightened library anxiety to lack of education in information literacy skills. To combat this, Gross and Latham suggest that K-12 programs, along with higher education settings, should equip students with information literacy skills such as the ability to effectively find and navigate information, critically evaluate authentic sources, and use information accurately and creatively.Melissa Gross and Don Latham, \\"Attaining information literacy: An investigation of the relationship between skill level, self-estimates of skill, and library anxiety\\", Library & Information Science Research, 23 August 2007 New York Columbia University librarian Anice Mills reported in 2016 that contributors to library anxiety were also the design and architecture of the building. Patrons may become anxious at the thought of navigating large and seemingly complicated building environments.  Suggestions for dealing with library anxiety  Most of the literature is written from the point of view of libraries and how they can create more welcoming environments through library instruction programs and other opportunities to interact with librarians; modifying librarian attitudes and behaviors to be seen as visible, approachable and unintimidating; using better signage, wording directions and instructions in jargon-free terminology; and having staff wear name tags. \\"Personal interaction appears to be the central component of reduction strategies and suggestions aimed at alleviating students' fears of the academic library,\\" according to Heather Carlile. Rachel A. Fleming-May, Regina N. Mays and Rachel Radom at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville piloted a collaboration with the Volunteer Bridge Program, a summer program aimed improving retention rates of at-risk students. The libraries created a three-session instruction program used in 2012 and 2013, and assessed student learning using a pre-test and post-test. The post-test found that 91 percent of students felt more comfortable with the library after the workshops, and 81 percent reported being more likely to ask a librarian for help with research. The Washington State University Libraries has a list of strategies to help students overcome this anxiety. New York Columbia University librarian Anice Mills suggested empathetic one-on-one discussions with students. She also suggested accessibility as an important tool to overcome patron anxiety. According to a 2011 paper by librarian Leslie J. Brown, Learning Commons can aid in reducing library anxiety in academic library patrons, allowing \\"users to get the assistance needed by going to only one place, which can be critical to reluctant users\\". Additionally, virtual reference services, such as Ask a Librarian and similar applications, as well as email reference services, are key for enabling patrons to gain access to library functions when anxiety issues may prevent students from engaging with a librarian at a physical reference desk. Brown notes that an attempt to demonstrate all of the library's services in one go (realizing that library anxiety may prevent the student from returning unless they know everything in the moment) may, paradoxically, overwhelm students, preventing them from returning, due to \\"user anxiety and feelings of incompetence\\". To this end, a 2016 paper by Elizabeth DiPrince, Amber Wilson, Chrissy Karafit, Amanda Bryant, and Chris Springer discusses the need for a print guide to library services as well. While DiPrince et al. note that \\"Obviously a print handbook cannot meet all need for information literacy instruction, considering the diversity of information needs on a college campus\\", a simple, easy-to- understand guide to the basics can overcome the need for a web-based guide that users \\"navigate through a number of pages and links to find the desired information\\", as websites can contain a lot of what is sometimes termed \\"library noise\\". In a test conducted at the University of Central Arkansas, found that a simple, lighthearted Library Survival Guide was successful at developing library engagement, and that students \\"showed an increase in student awareness of library services after distribution of the survival guides\\", and that \\"Both faculty and students informally expressed appreciation for the clear and concise information about library services and research strategies presented in the guide\\", noting that faculty incorporated the guide into their courses as an introduction to library services.

She believed it was her daughter after taking \\"time, growth and lack of makeup\\" into consideration, and noted that a scar on the woman's leg was identical to one that Calico had. Scotland Yard analyzed the photo and concluded that the woman was Calico, but a second analysis by the Los Alamos National Laboratory disagreed. An FBI analysis of the photo was inconclusive. Calico's case received extensive coverage on television programs such as A Current Affair, Unsolved Mysteries, and America's Most Wanted. It was also profiled on The Oprah Winfrey Show and 48 Hours. As of 2020, no arrests have been made and the case remains open. Disappearance On Tuesday, September 20, 1988, Calico left her home at about 9:30 A.M. to go on her daily bike ride along New Mexico State Road 47. She rode that route almost every morning and was sometimes accompanied by her mother, Patty Doel. However, Doel stopped riding with Calico after she felt that she had been stalked by a motorist. She advised Tara to think about carrying mace, but Tara rejected the idea. On the morning of Calico's disappearance, she had told Doel to come and get her if she was not home by noon, as she had plans to play tennis with her boyfriend at 12:30. When her daughter did not return, Doel went searching for her along Tara's usual bike route but could not find her; she then contacted the police. Pieces of Calico's Sony Walkman and a cassette tape were later discovered along the road. Doel believed that she might have dropped them in an attempt to mark her trail. Several people saw Calico riding her bicycle, which has never been found. No one witnessed her presumed abduction, although several witnesses observed a light-colored pickup truck (possibly a 1953 Ford) with a camper shell following closely behind her. Photographs =Toyota van= The two unidentified persons seen in the Polaroid found in June 1989. It is suspected the female is Calico. The boy in the background remains unidentified. On June 15, 1989, a Polaroid photo of an unidentified young woman and a boy, both gagged with black duct tape and seemingly bound, was discovered in the parking lot of a convenience store in Port St. Joe, Florida. The woman who found the photo said that it was in a parking space where a white windowless Toyota cargo van had been parked when she arrived at the store. She said that the van was being driven by a man with a mustache who appeared to be in his 30s. Police set up roadblocks to intercept the vehicle, but the man has never been identified. According to Polaroid officials, the picture had to have been taken after May 1989 because the particular film used in the photograph was not available until then. The photo was broadcast on A Current Affair in July, and Doel was contacted by friends who had seen the show and thought the woman resembled Calico. Relatives of Michael Henley, also of New Mexico, who had disappeared in April 1988, saw the episode and said that they believed he was the boy in the photo. Doel and Henley's parents both met with investigators and examined the Polaroid. Doel said that she was \\"convinced\\" it was Calico. She also noted that a scar on the woman's leg was identical to one that Calico had received in a car accident. In addition, a paperback copy of V.C. Andrews' My Sweet Audrina, said to be one of Calico's favorite books, can be seen lying next to the woman. Scotland Yard analyzed the photo and concluded that the woman was Calico, but a second analysis by the Los Alamos National Laboratory disagreed. An FBI analysis of the photo was inconclusive. Henley's mother said that she was \\"almost certain\\" it was Michael in the Polaroid. The identification of the boy in the photograph as Henley is considered highly unlikely: his remains were discovered in June 1990 in the Zuni Mountains, about from his family's campsite from which he had disappeared and from where Calico disappeared. Police believe that Henley wandered off and subsequently died of exposure. =Other photos= In 2009, twenty years after the Polaroid photo was found and shared by the media, pictures of a boy were sent to the Port St. Joe police chief, David Barnes. He received two letters, postmarked June 10 and August 10, 2009, from Albuquerque, New Mexico. One letter contained a photo, printed on copy paper, of a young boy with sandy brown hair. Someone had drawn a black band in ink on the photo, over the boy's mouth, as if it were covered in tape as in the 1989 picture. The second letter contained an original image of the boy. On August 12, The Star newspaper in Port St. Joe received a third letter, also postmarked in Albuquerque on August 10 and depicting the same image, of a boy with black marker drawn over his mouth. The boy has not been confirmed to be the same one as in the previous photo. None of the letters contained a return address or a note indicating the child's identity, making the officials there believe it may have something to do with the disappearance of Tara Calico. The letters were sent at the same time that a self-proclaimed psychic had called about Calico, saying that she had met a runaway in California with whom she worked in a strip club; this girl was eventually murdered. The caller said she had dreams suggesting the runaway may have been Calico and that she may be buried in California. Searches did not lead to any discoveries. The photos were given to the F.B.I. for further investigation in hope of finding fingerprints or possible D.N.A. evidence. Two other Polaroid photographs, possibly of Calico, have surfaced over the years. The first was found near a construction site in Montecito, California, and is a blurry photo of a girl's face with tape covering her mouth and light blue striped fabric behind her, \\"similar to that on the pillow in the Toyota van photo\\". It was taken on film that was not available until June 1989. The second shows \\"a woman loosely bound in gauze, her eyes covered with more gauze and large black-framed glasses\\", with a male passenger beside her on an Amtrak train. The film used was not available until February 1990. Calico's mother believed the first one was Tara, but thought that the second may have been a gag. Her sister stated, \\"They had a striking, uncalming resemblance. As for me, I will not rule them out. But keep in mind our family has had to identify many other photographs and all but those three were ruled out.\\" Later developments In 2008, Rene Rivera, the sheriff of Valencia County, reported that he received information that two teenagers had accidentally hit Calico with a truck, panicked, and subsequently killed her. According to Rivera, the boys, who knew Calico, drove up behind her in a truck and some form of an accident followed. Calico later died and those responsible covered up the crime. Rivera stated that he knew the names of those involved, but that, without a body, he could not make a case. He did not release the evidence that led him to this conclusion. Calico's stepfather, John Doel, said that the sheriff should not have made these comments if he was not willing to arrest anyone and that strong circumstantial evidence should be enough for a conviction. In October 2013, a six-person task force was established to reinvestigate Calico's disappearance. As of 2017, no arrests have been made and the case remains open. On October 1, 2019, the FBI announced that they are \\"offering a reward of up to $20,000 for precise details leading to the identification or location of Tara Leigh Calico and information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for her disappearance.\\"  See also  *List of people who disappeared References External links * Case File 257DFNM, The Doe Network * Tara Leigh Calico, The Charley Project * Vanished: The Tara Calico Story, documentary by a friend of Calico () * * Official police report Category:1988 in New Mexico Category:1980s missing person cases Category:September 1988 events in the United States Category:Missing people Category:Missing person cases in New Mexico Category:1969 births ","title":"Disappearance of Tara Calico"},{"id":"10542929","text":"Wilson Moreira Wilson Moreira (12 December 1936 ‚Äì 6 September 2018) was a Brazilian sambista. Biography Moreira was born in the neighborhood of Realengo, in Rio de Janeiro. As a teenager he was associated with the samba school Mocidade, where he won two samba-enredo contests in 1962 and 1963. In 1968, Wilson became affiliated to samba school Portela. Wilson had a prolific partnership with sambista Nei Lopes. One of their greatest hits was the song \\"Senhora Liberdade\\", which became an anthem in the Brazilian Diretas movement for the institution of direct national elections in the 1980s. Some other famous songs from the duo are \\"Gotas de Veneno\\", \\"Sand√°lia Amarela\\" and the non-samba \\"Candongueiro\\", which brings forward their African roots, with other successes as, e.g., \\"Meu Apelo\\", being signed by Wilson alone. Wilson was a guest on many records, and released quite a few of them. Some of his records were released at first to the Japanese market and then to Brazil, since Wilson is very prominent in Japan. Brazilian virtuoso Raphael Rabello was a big fan of Wilson, and took part in his records Peso na Balan√ßa and Okolof√©, both of which are considered up to this day some of the best finished samba albums ever. In March 1997 Wilson Moreira fell victim to a stroke which left him partially immobilized. Fund-raising shows were organized by the samba scene in order to obtain more resources for better treatments to the sambista. Wilson subsequently recovered and released a record, composing sambas in partnerships.

The revolt took place during the period 18‚Äì22 March 1848 and was successful in expelling the Austrian garrison, commanded by Josef Radetzky, from the city. Radetzky would re-enter Milan on 6 August of that year, however, and Austria remained in control of the city until 1859.

Ile-Rien =Vienne= Ornate and spectacular capital of the Fontainon kings, it is the cultural heart of Ile-Rien. Among its many splendors are the Royal Palace, the St. Anne's Gate and the Boulevard of Flowers, lined with exquisite shops and costly restaurants. The city is also home to many cathedrals, mansions of the wealthy as well as theaters and an opera house. From the viewpoint of Anton Baraselli, an Aderassi actor: > \\"Vienne was a jewel of a city in a rich setting, standing on temperate > plains roughly in the center of the country, with rolling hills and olive > groves on the warmer coast to the southwest, rich forested midlands, and > black-soiled farmland in the terraced valleys of the high country to the > north.\\" and > \\"A huddle of taverns and old houses on the side of a low hill commanding a > good view of the River Quarter.

Bel Garde A sizable fortress very near the city of Vienne, it is in a strategic location to jeopardize the security of the capital should it fall into the wrong hands. The ownership of Bel Garde is a plot point in The Element of Fire. In the Fall of Ile-Rien trilogy, a wealthy suburban town has sprung up around Bel Garde, one of the priciest and most exclusive. =Lodun= The provincial seat of the University of Lodun, and a sizable town in its own right. The town is described as being very picturesque, with neat homes with tiled roofs and overflowing flower boxes, often oddly situated among more commercial edifices as the town has encroached around the once widely spaced farmhouses. The town is ringed by orchards and farms. Due to its proximity to the University, many of the homes have runes carved into shutters and door or on freestanding wooden posts, or painted on walls and gables. University of Lodun =Duncanny= A region in Ile- Rien. As a youth, King Roland had hoped to enroll in its small, respectable college. In The Element of Fire, its feudal lord is titled a 'Count.' In The Fall of Ile-Rien trilogy, it appears to have been raised to a duchy; the Duchess of Duncanny is the leader of the Aid Society, organizing rescue efforts as well as drives for material contributions. =Alsene= The Duchy of Alsene is a region of Ile-Rien, and the home of Denzil, Duke of Alsene, an ambitious kinsman of King Roland, as well as a number of vassal lords loyal to the Duke. =Chaire= A large port city on the west coast of Ile-Rien, it is a major maritime center, the hub of the trading vessels between Ile-Rien, Parscia, and Capidara across the ocean. Chaire is also a coastal resort town, known for its beaches. Chaire is also known for its canals. =Port Rel= A port-city in on the west coast of Ile-Rien; in The Fall of Ile-Rien trilogy, it is the clandestine port of the Queen Ravenna during the war. It is also the covert headquarters of the Villier Institute during the war in the Fall of Ile-Rien trilogy. =Port Efarin= A small port-city on the west coast of Ile-Rien. Other Nations Bisra Ancient enemy of Ile-Rien, it is a very socially conservative country, influenced by its powerful church who police its populace for even the slightest 'heresy.' Unlike the people of Ile-Rien, Bisrans consider sorcery to be the work of the devil, and persecute all magical practitioners, and even go so far as to persecute the overtly superstitious. Ile-Rien and Bisra have fought numerous wars, the most recent during the reign of King Fulstan and Queen Ravenna. Bisra lies to the south of Ile-Rien. It superficially resembles Spain, in its arch-conservative religiosity. Adera A small, neighboring state to the south of Ile-Rien, Adera is famed for its lively culture, including its roving troupes of masked actors who perform the Comedia as well as for its cuisine. Aderassi-trained cooks are highly sought in the homes of the wealthy and the restaurants and hotels that cater to them. Its people are typically olive-skinned and dark- haired. It appears to be an analogue for Italy. During The Fall of Ile-Rien trilogy, Adera has been overrun by the Gardier, who are using it as a staging area for deep assaults into Ile-Rien. Parscia A neighboring nation of Ile- Rien, Parscia is also a coastal nation along the Western Ocean. The nation is known for its graceful architecture and body of scholarly works, as well as its intricately patterned textiles and carpets. Parts of Parscia are desert. It is alternately referred to as the 'Parscian Empire.' An ally of Ile-Rien during The Fall of Ile-Rien trilogy, Parscia is the intended location of the Rienish government-in-exile. The Low Countries A collection of neighboring states to the north of Ile-Rien, its people share a common, flat-sounding accent. They have founded colonies in the South Seas, principally around Maiuta and its environs. They are also referred to as the 'Lowlands.' =Umberwald= A neighboring state to Ile-Rien, it is the homeland of Queen Falaise. It appears be one of the Lowlands. =Aberdon= A state of the Lowlands, it has founded colonies in the islands of the South Seas, especially on Maiuta. Capidara A nation-state on a continent that bears the same name, it lies across the Western Ocean from Ile-Rien. Its principal city is called Capistown. Capidara is governed, at least partially, by a Senate. The most common language is Rienish, suggesting that Capidara may be a daughter- colony of Ile-Rien. The landmass of Capidara was inhabited by indigenous peoples called the Massians. They are aboriginal people with shamanistic religions. They appear to be a cross of the Native Americans, Polynesians and Australian Aborigines. They have been pushed to the margins of society and support themselves by selling native-made trinkets and outright begging. Most Capidarans regard them as uncivilized and while look upon them with disdain. =Capistown= The capital city of Capidara, it is a port city. It is tightly congested, having been built on a hilly peninsula, and with the advance of industry, it has become rather smoky and polluted, and its narrow roads have not been widened to accommodate automobile traffic. During The Fall of Ile- Rien trilogy, Capidara is connected to Ile-Rien and the other nations by regular sea travel, including ocean liners. Capidara is an ally in the war, and would send regular aid but for the dangers over the open ocean crossings presented by the Gardier airships. Capidara receives both Rienish and Parscian ambassadors. Maiuta A large, jungle-riddled island in the South Seas, it is populated by warring tribes who are often exploited by the more advanced nations. It has few ports or towns. Aberdon has founded a colony there. There are numerous islands surround Maiuta, hence the whole archipelago is referred to as the 'Maiutan Islands.' The island is occupied by the Gardier in The Fall of Ile-Rien trilogy, who use it as a naval and airbase to mount their operations. The colonists and missionaries of the Benevolent Order of Dane from Aberdon have been seized and used as forced labor.

Shirer, Gottfried Reinhardt, Ernst Lubitsch, Georg Ziomer and Anthony Veiller. Like its companion film, Know Your Enemy: Japan, the film is a full-length exploration of why one of the two major Axis countries started World War II and what had to be done to keep them from \\"doing it again\\". The film opens with scenes of everyday life in Germany, described by narrator Walter Huston. It shows people such as housewives, mailmen, farmers and policemen at work, and notes that these people were not so different from Americans, and seem like people Americans can understand. Anthony Veiller then interrupts with \\"Or can we?\\", as the film then switches to a montage of Nazi concentration camps and piles of dead bodies. The narrator notes that this is not the only time that Germany has unleashed war on the world, stating that while its generation fought the \\"Nazis\\", its fathers fought the \\"Huns\\" (pejorative term for Germany during World War I), and its grandfathers remember the \\"Prussians\\". The narrator states that it was all part of the same German lust for conquest. The militarism of the Prussian state is identified as the bad idea that triumphed over several other trends in German thought. Going even further back to identify the cause of this 150 years, the film informs us that while America, Britain, and France were forming their democratic traditions, Germany was a group of 300 medieval feudal states, not one of them with a constitution or parliament. The film traces the rise of Prussia from Frederick the Great through Otto von Bismarck, telling the audience that the Prussian state was organized as an instrument of aggressive conquest, dominated first by aristocratic landowners, militarists and state officials, later joined by those big industrialists with ties to the militarists and their Imperial Government (such as Krupp and Thyssen). The development of a military-industrial dominated state in the founding of the Prussian-dominated German Empire in 1870 climaxes in the catastrophe of World War I. When the nationalist militarists knew that they were beaten, according to the film, they allowed democratic parties to take the reins of power and immediately set about destabilising and discrediting the new republic. Once accomplished they found a stooge in Adolf Hitler, who would finally destroy the liberal Weimar Republic with the addition of a 5th pillar - party thugs. The film depicts the Third Reich from this perspective, seeing Nazism as simply a continuation of the aggressive German tradition, promoted by the military‚Äìindustrial complex (those businesses dependent on government contracts for arms). It does not quite make clear that the Party confounded its nationalist supporters by absorbing them, and becoming then only real power in Germany. The film says that Poles, Italians, Belgians, and Americans were murdered by the Germans. The Nazi persecution of Jews is not explicitly mentioned, but in the initial sequence of Nazi atrocities it shows the bones of \\"men, women and children: sent to be exterminated in a German death factory\\". The film also shows what are alleged to be \\"objects of art, made from human skin.\\" The film finishes with a list of different things that are being done to prevent Germany from starting another World War, chief among them the total conquest and control of the German state. Several specific examples include the destruction of Nazi art and literature, the creation of new textbooks to be taught to youth in Germany, a strong Allied military presence in Germany, the destruction of most of German war industry and the remaining industry controlled by the allies, and the removal of high ranking leaders from power. No mention of the Nuremberg trials are given here, as they began November 19, 1945, and instead the film shows a German army officer blindfolded with hands tied and shot at a post. The film ends with a short cautionary speech, where Anthony Veiller notes that for Germany, \\"We have rid him of Hitler, and the General staff, and Nazism, and militarism, but we have not rid him of Frederick, and Bismark, and the Kaiser, of his history and his traditions. That he must do for himself. Until he does, he is still a potential enemy of civilization. Only when he does can he take his place in the society of man. Then, and then only, will the German farmer, the German mailman, the German cop be like the folks back home. Then, and then only, can beautiful Germany, industrious Germany, cultured Germany join the peaceful nations of the world.\\" See also *Your Job in Germany *List of Allied propaganda films of World War II *Sonderweg External links  *Summary in notes from a 2006 college lecture by Prof. Harold Marcuse at UC Santa Barbara Category:1945 films Category:American World War II propaganda films Category:United States Department of War Category:Anti-German sentiment in the United States Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:Germany‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Frank Capra Category:1945 documentary films ","title":"Here Is Germany"},{"id":"10542974","text":"Top of Golondrinas as viewed from the low side, during a descent made in 1979 A caver rappels the drop from the cave's mouth Cross section of the cave The Cave of Swallows, also called the Cave of the Swallows (), is an open air pit cave in the Municipality of Aquism√≥n, San Luis Potos√≠, Mexico. The elliptical mouth, on a slope of karst, is 49 by 62 m wide and is undercut around all of its perimeter, widening to a room approximately 303 by 135 meters (994 by 442 ft) wide. The floor of the cave is a 333-meter (1092 ft) freefall drop from the lowest side of the opening, with a 370-meter (1,214 ft) drop from the highest side, making it the largest known cave shaft in the world, the second deepest pit in Mexico and perhaps the 11th deepest in the world. History The cave has been known to the local Huastec people since ancient times. The first documented descent was on 27 December 1966 by T. R. Evans, Charles Borland and Randy Sterns. Geology The cave is formed in the El Abra and Tamabra formations, limestones of Middle Cretaceous age. The cave's speleogenesis is still not fully known but is a result of solutional enlargement along a vertical fracture, with subsequent vadose enlargement. Etymology The cave's Spanish name S√≥tano de las Golondrinas means Basement of the Swallows, owing to the many birds which live in holes on the cave walls. These are mostly white-collared swifts (vencejos in Spanish) and green parakeets (periquillo quila). Actual swallows are in fact rarely found here. Each morning, flocks of birds exit the cave by flying in concentric circles, gaining height until they reach the entrance. In the evenings a large flock of swifts circles the mouth of the cave and about once each minute, a group of perhaps 50 breaks off and heads straight down towards the opening. When they cross the edge, the birds pull in their wings and free-fall, extending their wings and pulling out of the dive when they reach the heights of their nests. Watching this has become popular with tourists. Description Temperatures in the cave are low. Vegetation grows thickly at the mouth, The cave floor is covered with a thick layer of debris and guano. The fungi in the guano may cause histoplasmosis in humans. The cave floor and walls are inhabited by millipedes, scorpions, insects, snakes and birds. At the floor at the bottom of the main shaft there is a series of narrow pits known as \\"The Crevice\\", totaling some , which brings the total depth of the cave to . Extreme sports tourism The cave is a popular vertical caving destination. Cavers anchor their ropes on the low side, where bolts have been installed in the rock and the area is clear of obstructions. Rappelling to the floor can take up to an hour. Climbing back out may take from forty minutes to more than two hours. A person without a parachute would take almost ten seconds to freefall from the mouth to the floor, hence the pit is also popular with extreme sports enthusiasts for BASE jumping. BASE jumpers can get out in about 10 minutes using a winch. An average-sized hot air balloon has been navigated through the wide opening and landed on the floor below.

The Commission worked throughout the first mandate of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf after her election as President of Liberia in November 2005. The Liberian TRC came to a conclusion in 2010, filing a final report and recommending relevant actions by national authorities to ensure responsibility and reparations.Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights The Liberian TRC has garnered much criticism for its inability to address Charles Taylor and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. The Special Court for Sierra Leone indicted Charles Taylor, the leader of the rebel group the National Patriotic Front of Liberia that many of the crimes against humanity are attributed. This indictment prevented the Liberian TRC from hearing any testimony from Taylor. Sirleaf, on the other hand, was placed on a list of persons that should be barred from public office, a ruling which was later overturned by the Liberian Supreme Court. Creation and mandate The Liberian TRC's mandate was to \\"promote national peace, security, unity and reconciliation\\" by investigating more than 20 years of civil conflict in the country and to report on gross human rights violations that occurred in Liberia between January 1979 and 14 October 2003. \\"Violations\\" are defined as violations of international human rights standards, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and any breaches of the Geneva Conventions.Treaties and States Parties to such Treaties The goal of the Liberian TRC was to dispel falsifications and misconceptions of the country's past socioeconomic and political development. The TRC also strove to provide a forum to address issues of impunity and allow victims and perpetrators of human rights violations to share their experiences, thereby creating a clear picture of the past and facilitate genuine healing and reconciliation. To this end, the Liberian TRC was granted full independence from the Liberian government, to prevent potential biases among the commissioners and other TRC employees.Beyond the Truth and Reconciliation Commission: Transitional Justice Options in Liberia The Liberian TRC was given full power to investigate gross human rights violations and systematic abuses of power in Liberia and, when possible, to identify individuals or groups that perpetrated these violations and to ensure accountability. The Liberian government took extensive measures to allow the TRC to gather information and create a thorough final report. Unlike the South African TRC, the Liberian TRC only had the ability to recommend candidates for amnesty to the Liberian government. The Liberian TRC could also make suggestions to the Liberian government regarding reparation and rehabilitation for victims; legal, institutional, or other reforms; the need for further investigation and inquiries into certain matters; and the need to hold prosecutions in particular cases.Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia Mandate Commissioners The government of Liberia appointed 10 members.Meet The Commissioners * Jerome J.

Stewart * Massa Washington * Henrietta Joy Abena Mensa Bonsu The Final Report The Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was released on 1 July 2009. The Final Report summed nearly 400 pages and entailed the mandate of the TRC, the methodology used in its finding, the background of the conflict in Liberia, a summary of its process of collecting information, reports of its findings, and finally its recommendations to prevent atrocities like those carried out by Charles Taylor and Prince Johnson. The Final Report took into account over 20,000 individual statements from Liberia, the United States, Nigeria, Europe, and Ghana.Statement By The Carter Center on the Release of the Final Report of Liberia's Truth and Reconciliation Commission The final report dealt with the problems facing post civil war Liberia in two steps. The first determination of the Liberian TRC was a list of recommendations to the Liberian government for reparations to victims of the civil wars and reforms to prevent atrocities from reoccurring, and the second was a list of names of people who required additional investigation or were found to be deserving of amnesty. The Liberian TRC made a total of 47 recommendations to the Liberian government ranging from establishing national culture centers to promote Liberia's diverse culture to ensuring that perpetrators of gross violations of human right pay reparations to victims. The TRC made suggestions to ensure that victims of the Liberian Civil Wars received appropriate compensation and that perpetrators saw some form of punishment. They additionally suggested that resources and infrastructure be made available to settle any lasting problems or conflicts. The TRC recommended no blanket amnesty, but rather asked amnesty for those under the age of 18 when fighting and those that did not break any humanitarian laws. To the government, the TRC recommended many reformations to cultural systems in place including alteration of the national motto, a reduction of the number of political parties, enhanced regulation on political appointments, and an alteration of the official Liberian calendar to include holidays from multiple ethnic groups. Broadly, the Liberian TRC propositioned that the Liberian government promote a culture of respect for human rights, ensure the protection of women and children, and decentralize the Liberian government's power.A House with Two Rooms: Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia Diaspora Project Alongside the recommended policy changes, the TRC provided seven lists of persons or groups requiring extra investigation or deserving of amnesty. The final report listed 57 people or entities recommended for further investigation; 19 corporations, institutions, and state actors responsible for committing economic crime; 21 individuals for committing economic crime; 98 of the most notorious people that committed gross human rights violations; the eight leaders of the warring factions; and, lastly, a list of 50 persons recommended for sanctions. The TRC recommended that all individuals and entities noted as most notorious or requiring further investigation have a formal trial in the Liberian justice system.The Truth and Reconciliation of Liberia Final Report Among the list of persons that should be \\"specifically barred from holding public offices; elected or appointed for a period of thirty (30) years\\" for \\"being associated with former warring factions\\" was Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the current president of Liberia.Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia Final Report Volume II On 26 July, Sirleaf apologized to Liberia for supporting Charles Taylor, adding that \\"when the true nature of Mr. Taylor's intentions became known, there was no more impassioned critic or strong opponent to him in a democratic process\\" than she.Clinton Supports President of Liberia, New York Times. On 28 August Liberia's parliament announced they must \\"consult our constituents for about a year\\" before deciding whether or not to implement the Commission's recommendations.Liberian Parliament Delay Action on Truth Commission Findings, Bloomberg Charles Taylor debate Charles Taylor was a radical revolutionary in Liberia during the first Liberian Civil War and, after the death of Samuel Doe, was elected president of Liberia in 1997. During Taylor's rise to power and during his term as president, however, he carried out multiple atrocities against both the Liberian people and the people of Sierra Leone, grossly violating international humanitarian laws. After the second Liberian Civil War and Taylor's fall from power in 2003, the SCSL issued an indictment for Taylor's supposed involvement in the Sierra Leone Civil War. Through the SCSL, Charles Taylor faced trial in 2009,Trial Chamber Dismisses Motion for Judgment of Acquittal, Orders Taylor Defence to Open on June 29 receiving a guilty verdict on all charges on 26 April 2012.Charles Taylor Convicted on all 11 Counts; Sentencing Scheduled for 30 May While Charles Taylor did face prosecution and punishment through the SCSL, many are now criticizing the Liberian TRC for not having access to hear Taylor's testimony. Without Charles Taylor's version of Liberia's Civil Wars, the rewriting of Liberia's history is arguably incomplete, leaving the Liberian people vague as to the role he actually played in the humanitarian violations in Liberia. Priscilla Hayner, the a co-founder of the International Center for Transitional Justice, established three guidelines that Truth and Reconciliation Commissions should follow to ensure due process: the accused should be notified of the allegations held against them, they should be given the opportunity to respond to the charges, and the TRC should make clear in their final report that their findings on individual responsibility do not amount to criminal guilt. Because the Liberian government handed Charles Taylor over to the SCSL, they, and the Liberian TRC, lost access to Taylor, preventing him from testifying before the TRC and preventing a full truth of the events in Liberia from being constructed.Regional Approach to Transitional Justice?: Examining the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the Truth & Reconciliation Commission for Liberia Impact The Liberian TRC impact locally was minimal. In January 2011, the Supreme Court ruled in Williams v. Tah, a case brought by one of the people listed to be barred from public office in the TRC report. Their ruling stated that the TRC's recommendation on who should be allowed to hold office was an unconstitutional violation of the listed individuals' right to procedural due process, and that it would be unconstitutional for the government to implement the proposed bans. This decimated a large portion of the TRC's recommendations, allowing people that perpetrated or aided in gross human rights violations to remain in power in Liberia. Additionally, the other recommendations that the TRC made have not been followed, lowering the local impact to essentially none. Even though the government has not instituted the recommendations made by the TRC, 73% of Liberians had heard of the TRC and 62% believed their proposed changes should be implemented. However, only 39% of Liberians believed that the TRC actually helped promote peace and unity in Liberia.United States Institute of Peace While the Liberian TRC did not drastically alter the political situation in Liberia, it did take steps in the truth and reconciliation process that other TRCs had not taken. The TRC worked with The Advocates for Human Rights, a U.S. based organization to help promote Liberian diaspora communities in the TRC's work, the first time a TRC had gathered statements and hearings in this method. These diaspora communities allowed the TRC to gather statements from the refugees that had fled during the Liberian Civil Wars. The Liberian TRC also broke new ground in recommending prosecution of groups that committed economic crimes. These crimes ranged from tax evasion to aiding and abetting war crimes. Even though the TRC did not have its suggestions enacted by the Liberian government, the steps they took in the truth and reconciliation community will likely be taken into consideration by Truth and Reconciliation Commissions in the future.A Search for Truth: A Critical Analysis of the Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission Criticisms The Liberian TRC has faced much criticism for a variety of reasons. Critics have claimed that the TRC lacked adequate funding, competent staff, and sufficient infrastructure. The government's failure to follow through on the recommendations made by the TRC has reflected poorly on the Liberian Truth Commission's image. In 2008, Amnesty International criticized the TRC's inability to publicize its policies on reparation and prosecution, as well as the commission's policies on protection for victims, lack of general amnesty for those that provide information, and inability to provide individual reparations. The TRC also ran past its indicated period of activity, which caused the final hearings and the report to be rushed to meet the mandated deadline. This hurriedness caused a disconnect between the names recommended for prosecution or to be barred from office and their specific crimes along with a general lack of evidence to support the claims made by the TRC. The Liberian TRC's lack of power has been pointed out and further demonstrated by the Liberian government failing to enact any of their recommendations. Beyond having its recommendations ignored, the list of individuals recommended to be barred from office was found unconstitutional by the Liberian government. This ruling allowed President Sirleaf, who was recommended to be barred from office, to remain in power, garnering much international criticism.Liberia: A Briefing Paper on the TRC Report Additional sources * Official Website of the TRC * Liberia to get US abuses report * Liberia's Truth and Reconciliation Commission: An Interim Assessment * Human Rights Watch: Justice for Liberia * We the Victims: Why Liberians Must Demand a War Crimes Tribunal For the Prosecution of Crimes Against Humanity * Liberia's Truth and Reconciliation Commission: The Importance of Documentation in Postwar Education and Reconciliation * Liberia: Opinion divided on Truth and Reconciliation findings References Category:History of Liberia Liberia ","title":"Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Liberia)"},{"id":"10543053","text":"\\"The Silent Sun\\" (album title \\"Silent Sun\\") is the premiere single by English rock band Genesis.

The title is a play on the novel Think Fast, Mr. Moto by John P. Marquand, and the film of the same title starring Peter Lorre. Synopsis The parochial house has a leak in its roof, which happens to be over Jack's head. Ted and Dougal move him, only to have another leak start over Jack's new position. Ted decides to hold a raffle to raise money for the roof. He calls Bishop Brennan and secures permission to raffle a blue Rover 213. Ted and Dougal leave to retrieve the Rover. Upon their return, Dougal spots a small dent on the bonnet. Ted is dismayed and tries to \\"tap it away\\" with a hammer from the tool kit, but ends up creating another small dent, which he also tries to fix. After much time has passed, Ted has only succeeded in destroying the car's exterior. Realising that they are in dire straits if Bishop Brennan should learn what was done to the Rover (which Ted states was worth ¬£7000), Ted decides to procure another. The priests remember that Father Finnegan, the so-called \\"dancing priest\\" (as he dances for peace), has a Rover identical to the ruined original. Ted comes up with the idea to get a lend of the Rover from Finnegan, and then organise the raffle so that he and Dougal would win it, and be able to return the car afterwards. The next day, they travel to Finnegan's home to borrow the Rover. Ted gets permission and the keys. As soon as Ted leaves his sight, Father Finnegan suffers a fatal heart attack. Ted's scheme for rigging the raffle involves filling a hat with a load of tickets that all bear the number 11, which will be Dougal's number, and Ted himself, as the Master of Ceremonies, drawing and calling that number on stage while Dougal waits in the audience. On the night of the event, Ted and Dougal work feverishly to sell tickets. They also secure Father Billy O'Dwyer, a.k.a. \\"The Spinmaster\\", to provide music. However, he only has one record and a major gambling problem, which results in his purchase of 2000 raffle tickets. Later, the announcement that the organisers have won the raffle manages to suck the life out of the event. Back at the parochial house, Mrs. Doyle reveals that Father Finnegan has died from a heart attack, most likely brought on by excessive continuous dancing. Ted and Dougal realise that they will be able to keep the car. However, things turn to the worse quickly. Ted discovers that an inebriated Father Jack has driven the car to the shops to acquire more drink. He asks Father Jack what he has done with the car. Jack explains curtly that the car was hit by not one, but two trucks. When Ted and Dougal inspect the damage, they discover that although the front half is intact (except for a partially detached number plate), the rear half has been crushed beyond repair. While they are out, Father O'Dwyer steals the raffle money to pay off his debts. With the weatherman predicting rain until August, and the leak getting worse and worse, Ted, Jack, Dougal and Mrs Doyle are forced to wear anoraks indoors, with Ted expressing outrage that someone could steal money from a priest. A tree is then struck by lightning, and subsequently falls and comes crashing straight through the roof. Production The episode's title is a reference to the 1937 film Think Fast, Mr. Moto. At one point, the writers intended every episode title to contain the name \\"Father Ted\\", in reference to the Mr. Moto series, but they ran out of ideas for this format. In the commentary, Linehan notes that this episode was where they began to expand Father Jack's vocabulary, with the \\"I'm a happy camper\\" scene. They considered writing an episode where Jack's eloquent, articulate brother visits, also played by Frank Kelly, most likely titled \\"Double Trouble\\", but decided the concept would be too clich√©d. At the time of writing this episode, Mathews was \\"obsessed\\" with the poor special effects of Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 film The Birds. The non sequitur scene where the priests are attacked by birds was originally an attempt to recreate the film's backwards tracking shot, with people running and waving their hands, which Mathews found unintentionally hilarious. Linehan notes that the joke did not translate well in the final episode, because the special effect for the birds was actually quite good. The dancing priest was inspired by Neil Horan, a real Catholic priest who \\"danced for peace\\". A young Aidan Gillen auditioned for the role. As part of the audition, he had to dance alongside Linehan (who performed Ted's lines). According to Linehan, Gillen became so embarrassed by the situation that he ran out of the building and never returned. Ben Keaton also auditioned for the part, but the writers were so impressed by his performance that they gave him the larger role of Father Purcell. In retrospect, the writers were unsure what the joke in Father Purcell's line \\"Ah, it's yourself!\\" was. Linehan thought the joke was that Purcell believed the throw blanket was really Jesus, while Mathews thought the joke was that Purcell would simply talk to anything. The credits scene, where Father Purcell talks to himself in the closet, was almost entirely improvised by Keaton. Linehan notes that some people think \\"Ghost Town\\" by The Specials is an inherently funny song because of its use in the episode, while the joke was originally that it is simply \\"not a floor filler\\". Mathews plays one of the four priests in the Kraftwerk-esque band at the raffle, Linehan plays the voice of radio presenter John Morgan, from \\"The John Morgan Morning Show\\", and the weatherman on the television is voiced by director Declan Lowney. None of the three were credited for their cameo appearances. Legacy In 2014, Ben Keaton returned to the role of Father Purcell, performing a stand-up routine and hosting pub quizzes entirely in character. Keaton also set up a Twitter page for the character, and a website where fans can purchase customised Father Purcell video greetings.

Briefly in 1834 he was provisional president of El Salvador, and in 1839 he was provisional president of Guatemala. He was born in 1800 in El Salvador to Gregorio Salazar and Francisca Castro y Lara. His father was interim president of the Federal Republic of Central America from September 16, 1834 to February 14, 1835. Salazar was sent at age 12 to Guatemala to study humanities at the Colegio Tridentino. He graduated from secondary school in 1817 and returned to El Salvador, where he dedicated himself to commerce and to tending the estates of his family. He also joined the independence movement. He was a deputy to the local congress in 1822. He fought alongside Liberal General Francisco Moraz√°n in the Central American civil wars, becoming his lieutenant in 1832, in the deposition of the Salvadoran head of state, Jos√© Mar√≠a Cornejo. From June 23, 1834 to July 13, 1834 Salazar served as provisional head of state of El Salvador. On the latter date, the federal government took over direct control of the state, and Salazar's father, Gregorio Salazar, became acting chief of state. General Salazar (the son) again fought at the side of his friend and ally General Moraz√°n in 1837, against the movement known as \\"The Moderates\\" (Los Moderados). He was decorated for his performance in this campaign. In 1839 he was the hero of the Battle of Villa Nueva (near Guatemala City), where Moraz√°n's Liberals defeated the Conservatives under Rafael Carrera and forced a (temporary) treaty of peace with him. He was secretary of the interior of the State of Guatemala in 1839 when the Liberals named him provisional president of the state to replace Mariano Rivera Paz. Salazar served in this capacity from January 30, 1839 to April 13, 1839, when Rivera returned to office. Carrera soon renewed the civil war. With the fall of General Moraz√°n's federal regime in 1840, Salazar accompanied him to Costa Rica on Moraz√°n's way into exile. Salazar stayed in Costa Rica when Moraz√°n went to Colombia, and retired from politics. He opened a business in San Jos√©, and lived there until his death on July 23, 1867. In El Salvador he has been designated Benem√©rito de la Patria. El Salvador repatriated his remains, which are now buried in a cemetery in San Salvador.

It lies on the border with Belgium. The population as of 1999 was 10,527. Residents of the area are known as Cond√©ens or Cond√©ennes. The Mayor of Cond√©- sur-l'Escaut is Gregory Lelong (2015). Geography Cond√©-sur-l'Escaut is northeast of Valenciennes, from Lille, and from Brussels, Belgium. It is situated at the confluence of the Haine and Scheldt rivers. The region is noted for its coal mines, resources which made it a strategic objective in both world wars. History The name comes from a Celtic word, \\"Condate\\", meaning \\"confluence\\", referring to the two rivers. A Romanised form of the word, Condatum, was in use during the Roman period, and \\"Cond√©\\" was in use by the 14th century. The current name, Cond√©-sur-l'Escaut, dates from 1886. Being at the confluence of two rivers, the site has had military importance since before Roman times. Originally occupied by Nervians, it was the location of a Roman military camp, and later a settlement of Franks. Vikings also were established there temporarily, in 855, holding the town until 889. The area was much disputed, and changed hands many times during the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods. It was captured by the Flemish forces of Jacques van Artevelde, by King Louis XI of France, by Les Gueux during the Eighty Years' War, and by Turenne. In 1676 Louis XIV seized the town, and it became part of France in 1678 with the Treaty of Nim√®gue. While Vauban improved its fortifications, it was captured by Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld after a 92-day siege in 1793. Forces of the Seventh Coalition captured it from Napoleon Bonaparte in 1815, only returning it to French control three years later. The town was occupied by the Germans during the Second World War, who used the population to run the adjacent coal mines. On 2 September 1944 the town was liberated by the U.S. 5th Armored Division. Coal mining became defunct in 1989; recently there has been a population decline, following a high (13,994) in 1975. Music history Cond√©-sur-l'Escaut is known in music history as the home, place of retirement, and burial place of Renaissance composer Josquin des Prez. He was provost of the church of Notre-Dame, which had one of the most sumptuous musical establishments in Hainaut, exceeded only by the cathedral at Cambrai, as well as St. Vincent at Soignies. Josquin's house was on the market square; on his death he left an endowment for processions to stop at the statue of the Virgin Mary, attached to a wall of his house, and sing his six-voice Pater noster. He was buried in the church, which was destroyed in 1793 along with his tombstone.Macey, Grove online Heraldry Administration Cond√©-sur-l'Escaut is the eastern member of the agglomerated Valenciennes metropolitan area, which together administers 35 communes.

It was quite different engine design than the previous Maybach Mb.IV, not just a simple modification.  Design and development  Like all engines of that time, the previous Maybach design, the Mb IV, lost at high altitude as much as half of the nominal power of 240 horsepower. The new Maybach Mb IVa of 1916 was the first engine designed to overcome this limitation. It did not use a supercharger, but a much more primitive solution. The engine had purposely \\"oversized\\" cylinders, and a significantly higher 6.08:1 compression ratio. It was tested on Wendelstein (mountain) at an altitude of 1800 m and rated there at 245 hp. This would theoretically correspond to rating of about 300 hp at sea level; however, the engine was not designed to withstand such power \\\\- it needed to be carefully throttled down at low altitude, so it would not exceed the safe level of 245 hp. It had three carburettor settings, to be changed during the flight depending on the altitude.

Most Brayons view themselves as neither Acadian nor Qu√©b√©cois, affirming that they are a distinctive culture with a history and heritage linked to farming and forestry in the Madawaska area, unlike both the primarily maritime heritage of the modern Acadians and the St. Lawrence Valley history of the Qu√©b√©cois, while others embrace their roots as Acadians, celebrating some of their holidays and traditions. Dialect Classification of Brayon as a dialect within Quebec French is largely disputed as, unlike Acadian French, for example, Brayon does not possess its own words or definitions. The primary difference consists in a simple denotation of certain words due to their pronunciation. In French language, it is a generally found denotation as many words, such as masculine and feminine adjective endings or the past tenses of some verbs, are homophones. Both Brayon and Acadian are considered dialects of French (as opposed to independent languages), though the definition of the terms \\"language\\" and \\"dialect\\" may also overlap and are often subject to debate. One basic distinctive trait of Brayon, however, is made in words such as tache (\\"stain\\") and t√¢che (\\"task\\"), where the \\"a\\" tends to resemble an open back unrounded vowel , notwithstanding of the circumflex. This in turn highlights the difference of pronouncing \\"a\\" in a (3rd singular of the verb avoir, \\"to have\\") and √† (pronoun \\"at\\"), already strong in Quebec French as compared to Standard French. The same rule also applies to in maigre (\\"skinny\\") and vinaigre (\\"vinegar\\"), which transforms into , as in f√™te (\\"feast\\"). Boundaries The border between New Brunswick and Quebec, and to some extent Maine, traditionally has not mattered much to the people of the area, hence the commonalities and close relationship between Brayons and Qu√©b√©cois and parts of northern Maine; likewise, Brayon French is not completely restricted to Madawaska County. This view of uniqueness led (at least jokingly) to the founding of the R√©publique du Madawaska during the Aroostook War, wherein some Brayons, disgusted with the actions of both British and American interlopers on their historical lands, declared themselves allied with neither and independent. Of course, the r√©publique was never formally recognized and was ultimately split by the Webster-Ashburton Treaty into American and Canadian parts. Cultural echoes The spirit of the R√©publique du Madawaska lives on at least in the hearts and minds of local residents. The r√©publique has its own flag (designed in 1938-https://mynewbrunswick.ca/city-of-edmundston/ ) which flies in and around Edmundston.George L. Findlen, \\"Under His Own Flag: John Baker's Gravestone Memorial in Retrospect\\" The honorary Pr√©sident de la R√©publique (President of the Republic) is the sitting Mayor of Edmundston, There is the Republic Provincial Park and there is a small Mus√©e de la R√©publique (Museum of the Republic) in Edmundston dedicated to Brayon history. The heritage of les Brayons is celebrated annually in the Foire Brayonne, a music and cultural festival.

The title is a pun on the BBC TV music show The Old Grey Whistle Test. Synopsis Ted prepares for a picnic outing with other priests, but find they have been waylayed, while Dougal makes an excuse not to go so he can spend more time with a rebellious new priest, Father Damien \\"Damo\\" Lennon, who behaves like an insolent teenager. Ted expresses his concerns about Damien to Dougal, but Dougal continues to hang out with him. Ted decides to go to the desolate picnic area by himself. However, he ultimately takes Jack with him, after Jack recognised a bottle of Jacob's Creek Chardonnay from 1991 that Ted was taking, just by hearing the bottle clinking (despite Ted trying to convince him that it is just fizzy water), and demanded a drink; Jack very quickly drinks the whole bottle when Ted's back is turned. Despite no one else being there, a couple of aggressive regulars accost Ted, demanding they move, and the overzealous groundskeeper Benson intercedes, blowing his whistle frequently. Ted, disgusted, leaves with Jack. That night, an unknown person steals Benson's whistle, and the next day the whole of Craggy Island is in arms about the theft; Benson is so traumatised about the theft that he has lost the use of his leg and is forced to use a wheelchair. Ted discovers the whistle in a pack of cigarettes in Dougal's coat, and starts to get Dougal to confess. Just then, Benson and Sergeant Hodgkins arrive at the parochial house, with news that a witness to the crime said it was done by a priest. Dougal, having misinterpreted what Ted was telling him, states Ted stole the whistle. Shocked, Ted leaves to come up with an explanation. While he is out of the room, Father Frost arrives, dragging Damien with him, having discovered he was the actual thief and that he tried to frame Dougal. Ted returns, and starts a long fabrication of the reasons for stealing the whistle until he realises the case has been solved. After the others leave, Ted gives Dougal a lecture about trusting those who are \\"cool\\". He explains that there is no place in the Roman Catholic Church for bad apples such as Father Damien, the Bishop of Galway (a priest who lived with his housekeeper), and a priest who was running guns into Iraq ‚Äì \\"the list goes on and on\\". He then asks Dougal if he has learned anything from this, to which Dougal replies, \\"No\\". Production Arthur Mathews plays the irate man who ‚Äì strictly observing the picnic area's no-swearing rule ‚Äì tells Ted to, \\"Fup off, you grasshole!\\" Legacy In 2015, Joe Rooney said that he would be interested in making a Father Damo spin-off, and suggested that Damo would probably be working in The Projects in New York City, living with \\"a girl and a gay fella\\" and rapping Mass. In 2016, Rooney reprised the role of Damo for an Over The Top wrestling match alongside Patrick McDonnell and Michael Redmond as Eoin McLove and Father Stone.

Dotted line denotes a detected change point. In statistical analysis, change detection or change point detection tries to identify times when the probability distribution of a stochastic process or time series changes. In general the problem concerns both detecting whether or not a change has occurred, or whether several changes might have occurred, and identifying the times of any such changes. Specific applications, like step detection and edge detection, may be concerned with changes in the mean, variance, correlation, or spectral density of the process. More generally change detection also includes the detection of anomalous behavior: anomaly detection. Online change detection Using the sequential analysis (\\"online\\") approach, any change test must make a trade-off between these common metrics: * False alarm rate * Misdetection rate * Detection delay In a Bayes change-detection problem, a prior distribution is available for the change time. Online change detection is also done using streaming algorithms. Minimax change detection In minimax change detection, the objective is to minimize the expected detection delay for some worst-case change-time distribution, subject to a cost or constraint on false alarms. A key technique for minimax change detection is the CUSUM procedure. Offline change detection Basseville (1993, Section 2.6) discusses offline change-in-mean detection with hypothesis testing based on the works of Page and Picard and maximum-likelihood estimation of the change time, related to two-phase regression. Other approaches employ clustering based on maximum likelihood estimation, or use optimization to infer the number and times of changes. \\"Offline\\" approaches cannot be used on streaming data because they need to compare to statistics of the complete time series, and cannot react to changes in real time but often provide more accurate estimation of the change time and magnitude. Applications of change detection Change detection tests are often used in manufacturing (quality control), intrusion detection, spam filtering, website tracking, and medical diagnostics. Linguistic change detection Linguistic change detection refers to the ability to detect word- level changes across multiple presentations of the same sentence. Researchers have found that the amount of semantic overlap (i.e., relatedness) between the changed word and the new word influences the ease with which such a detection is made (Sturt, Sanford, Stewart, & Dawydiak, 2004). Additional research has found that focussing one's attention to the word that will be changed during the initial reading of the original sentence can improve detection. This was shown using italicized text to focus attention, whereby the word that will be changing is italicized in the original sentence (Sanford, Sanford, Molle, & Emmott, 2006), as well as using clefting constructions such as \\"It was the tree that needed water.\\" (Kennette, Wurm, & Van Havermaet, 2010). These change-detection phenomena appear to be robust, even occurring cross- linguistically when bilinguals read the original sentence in their native language and the changed sentence in their second language (Kennette, Wurm & Van Havermaet, 2010). Recently, researchers have detected word-level changes in semantics across time by computationally analyzing temporal corpora (for example:the word \\"gay\\" has acquired a new meaning over time) using change point detection.

Biography Jean Jacques Caux, known as Cataline, was born in rural southern France around 1830, most likely in a town called Oloron in the Bearn region. In 1858 the town joined up with Ste-Marie, so the town then became Oloron-Sainte-Marie. When he first came to what was later known as British Columbia he packed on a small scale with only one animal. He eventually worked his way up to having larger pack trains with up to 60 animals, according to some, and it is said he had at least four pack trains. The early years Cataline packed from Yale to Barkerville during the Cariboo Gold Rush, working mostly with experienced Mexican packers. He lived with a NLaka'pamux woman from Spuzzum called Amelia York, native name C'eyxkn. Jean had at least two children with her; the first was William Benjamin, the second was Rhoda Dominic Urquhart. It is also possible that another child, Clara Dominic Clare who had many descendants, was also Jean Caux's child. Genealogical research is being done to ascertain if Jean Caux is actually their ancestor.Irene Bjerky, descendant of Clara Clare and researcher of Jean Caux. In the 1880s, his packing partner was Joe Castillou, another Frenchman who was mistaken as a Spaniard; because of his name they called him 'Castillion'. Joe eventually went his own way from Cataline's pack train, and settled in Merritt, BC, Canada. He is commemorated in the Nicola Valley Museum in Merritt, with his son Henry Castillou, the \\"Cowboy Judge of the Cariboo\\", and alongside the display of the famed anthropologist James Teit; a researcher of aboriginal culture who worked for the Chicago Museum of Natural History. Caux and Castillou did some packing trips for James Teit, which is where young Henry acquired his taste for the local culture. Perhaps people thought Caux & Castillou were Spanish because they used Spanish words for packing, such as secundo and aparejo. It is not hard to determine where these words originated when one remembers that these men grew up at the base of the Pyrenees Mountains, which is the border of Spain & France. However, as most packers in the early years in BC were Mexican, it is most likely that Spanish became the language of the profession for that reason. Although the exact date of his arrival in British Columbia is unknown, it is recorded that he was packing at the beginning of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in 1858 and continued until 1912, a span of 54 years.  A man with unique traits  Cataline was known to wear the same type of clothing year round: a boiled white shirt, heavy woolen pants, riding boots and no socks. When he had business to conduct, he added a collar, tie and a French hat to his apparel. One of the most famous stories is that he used to rub liquor into his hair. He would drink his cognac or whisky, leaving a small amount to pour into his hand, and rub it into his hair; saying \\"A liddle insida, a liddle outsida. Bon! She maka da hair grow!\\" On every trip he brought along a chair made of birch and rawhide where he would sit as he negotiated his business, while everyone else sat on the ground. Though it has been said he was illiterate, he had an excellent memory and kept his business records in his head without ever making a single note. He could sign his name with a flourish, so one must wonder if he actually was illiterate, or perhaps just keeping his business to himself. Pack trains Cataline's pack train usually consisted of sixty mules. Each outfit also employed six or more men, a foreman, also known as a corregidor, a second man, known as a secundo, a cook and several muleteers. The pack mules could carry 250‚Äì300 pounds and could navigate very difficult trails. Cataline's mules were so well trained that when the corregidor rang a signal bell, they would go to their own packs and wait to be loaded. In Cataline's outfit, around the turn of the century, his corregidor was Ah Gun and his secundo was Dave Wiggins. Even though he used over sixty mules, he knew to the item what each of them carried, where they were being delivered to and what he had to charge. And although he ran mule trains for over half a century it was said he never lost a pound of cargo, except in one instance when his secundo, upon smelling a two-pound package of Limburger cheese, decided it was rotten and threw it away. Once aware of the error, Cataline made sure it was replaced and delivered. Another story about him involves a loan that he had to make after a disease had killed several of his mules. The bank manager questioned Cataline's collateral, wondering how many mules and horses he owned before consenting to lend him the money. When Cataline returned to the bank in the fall to repay the debt, he counted out the exact amount owing and paid it in full. The bank manager noted that Cataline had more money on his person and suggested that he deposit it in the bank. Cataline responded with a query as to how many horses and mules the bank owned, and upon learning it was none, decided to keep his money.  After the CPR  With the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway, he moved his headquarters to Ashcroft. Amelia remained in Spuzzum, but he continued to support her and her children, always in the form of $20 gold coins. During this period, he was friends with Judge Matthew Baillie Begbie, who once held an impromptu court to provide Cataline with Canadian citizenship when his squatting rights were questioned. In 1897, Cataline led a pack train all the way from Ashcroft, then the southern terminus of the Cariboo Road, all the way to the Yukon Territory. Quesnel and Hazelton When the construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway was announced, Cataline moved his operations to Quesnel to better serve the booming Central Interior. He packed throughout the Cariboo, Central Interior and Skeena River district until 1912 when he retired in Hazelton. In 1920 he decided to spend his remaining winters in Victoria, but after spending just one winter in the Dominion Hotel, he returned to Hazelton for the rest of his days. He died in October 1922 at the age of 85 and is buried in the Gitanmaax cemetery.

The main character of the trilogy is Arn Magnusson, a fictional Knight Templar in the 12th century, who becomes a witness as well as a catalyst to many important historical events both in his homeland of V√§stra G√∂taland and in the Crusader states.Sandra Ballif Straubhaar, \\"A Birth Certificate for Sweden, Packaged for Postmoderns: Jan Guillou's Templar Trilogy,\\" in The Year's Work in Medievalism 15 (2002), ed. Jesse Swan and Richard Utz. The trilogy consists of the following novels: *The Road to Jerusalem, original Swedish title V√§gen till Jerusalem (1998) *The Knight Templar, original Swedish title Tempelriddaren (1999) *The Kingdom at the End of the Road, also called Birth of a Kingdom, original Swedish title Riket vid v√§gens slut (2000) There is also a fourth novel entitled The Heritage of Arn (2001), original Swedish title Arvet efter Arn. It is as a direct follow-up to the trilogy, depicting the rise of Birger Jarl, who came to rule during the formation of Sweden and is the supposed founder of Stockholm. In Guillou's fictional universe, Birger Jarl is the grandson of Arn Magnusson.  Concept and creation  In 1995 Guillou had finished his bestselling Cold War spy series about Carl Hamilton. By this time he had begun noticing an increasing hostility in Western media, such as on CNN, against the Arab world. He concluded that the United States and the United Kingdom were looking to target a new enemy to replace the Soviet Union and Communism, in order for the West to keep the world separated into good guys and bad guys. He decided to depict this political development by writing about the previous Holy War between Christianity and Islam.Guillou, Jan (2003). P√• jakt efter historien. pp. 90-91 Guillou, Jan (2009). Orders makt och vanmakt. pp. 429-437 Although the majority of the Crusading Knights came from France, Guillou needed a Swedish protagonist since he is mainly writing for a Swedish readership, even he admits that a Swedish crusading knight is less realistic. With this decision a large part of the plot had to be set in Sweden, but when Guillou began his historical research about the 12th century he found that Sweden was yet to be created. At his chosen period, the different realms that were to be consolidated into Sweden were still ruled by blood-feuding noble houses and many historical facts were vague and contested. This added the creation of Sweden as a major theme for the trilogy, and he chose the historical thesis that the region of V√§stra G√∂taland had been the cradle of Sweden.Guillou, Jan (2003). P√• jakt efter historien. pp. 93, 95 Guillou, Jan (2009). Orders makt och vanmakt. pp. 434-435  Main plot  The first novel begins in the year 1150 with the birth of Arn in the kingdom of V√§sterg√∂tland, one of the realms pre-dating Sweden. The story follows Arn's childhood and upbringing and his subsequent involvement in the politics and events of the realm, before being banished to the Holy Land at the age of 17. The second novel follows Arn in Palestine, where he has become a Knights Templar and participates in the defense of Gaza and Jerusalem from the forces of Saladin. In parallel the novel also follows the development in V√§sterg√∂taland, through the eyes of his lover Cecilia. The third novel sees the return of Arn to V√§sterg√∂tland, where he implements his learnings from the Crusades into his home society and takes a crucial part in the formation of Sweden. The character of Arn Magnusson Arn is born in the year 1150 as the second son of a noble Folkung family in Arn√§s, V√§sterg√∂tland. At the age of five he has a life-threatening accident when falling from the tower of his family's fortress, and is believed to be saved from harm thanks to his mother's intense prayers to Saint Bernard of Clairvaux. The mother considers it a miracle and finds she must recompensate God by giving the boy to the monastery Varnhem. Arn remains with the monks for twelve years, largely isolated from the outside world, and in addition to studying the languages and the learned arts of the monks he comes to be trained in the art of medieval war by a brother Guilbert who is a former Knight Templar in Outremer. Brother Guilbert trains Arn in horse riding and the use of weapons, with the modern techniques from France and the Holy Land that is yet to be discovered in Scandinavia, where the men still fight like Vikings. When reaching adulthood, the Prior Father Henri tells Arn he is to return to his family. Arn wishes to become a monk, but before being able to take the eternal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience (q.v. Evangelical counsels) he must witness the outside world. Arn gets involved in the deadly politics of the realm, both with his own family's local feuds and the blood- feud between the two royal families competing for the throne. He proves himself as a superior swordsman when defending his family's honour and participates in the assassination of the king, making him a prolific adversary in the feud for the throne. Through political schemes he is judged guilty of the terrible sin of fornication before marriage with the noble daughter Cecelia Algotsdotter, who he is engaged to. Cecelia has become pregnant and tells her sister Katarina. Katarina, who fears she will be stuck in the nunnery she has until then shared with Cecelia, becomes jealous and tells the Abbess. To make things worse, she purports that Arn also had carnal knowledge of her as well, from a feast when she had attempted (and failed) to seduce a very naive and very drunk Arn. According to the laws of the Church, it is considered especially heinous and scandalous to have sexual intercourse with two women who have the same mother, and further triggered by his role in the ongoing power struggle in the realm, Arn is condemned to spend 20 years in the Holy Land as a Knight Templar, while Cecelia is given the same sentence to the nunnery. At the age of 27, Arn has become a veteran in the Crusader army, when he faces the strangest experience a Knight Templar can have. During a time of truce, while pursuing a band of Saracen thieves, he comes across the very enemy of all Christendom, Saladin, and saves his life. This idea is apparently borrowed from The Talisman by Sir Walter Scott. After this, both become very close friends, but great enemies at the same time. Arn returns to his command of the fortress at Gaza, later seeing Saladin's army arrive but not stay to lay siege, instead advancing on a bigger prize, the city of Jerusalem. Arn is given the order to march with all his knights, and they defeat Saladin's army at the Battle of Montgisard. When Arnold of Torroja is named Grand Master of the Knights Templar, Arn is summoned to Jerusalem to become Master of the city. In the Battle of Hattin, Arn is severely wounded and spends several weeks at Saladin's hospital in Damascus, after that he accompanies him to Jerusalem, which is conquered. In the very end of the second book, Richard the Lionheart comes to Palestine with an army of crusaders. He captures Acre from Saladin, and when about to buy the freedom of 5,700 prisoners from the Christian king, Saladin and Arn were horrified to see Richard having them slaughtered, even the children \\"as the mamluks were riding, trying to save them, in tears.\\" Arn then confides that Richard \\"only will be remembered as the slaughterer\\" and that he will never capture Jerusalem, thus confiding himself that he doesn't care if the city remains in Muslim hands. He embraces Saladin, and then starts traveling home to Sweden, where a kingdom is about to be born. On his leave Saladin hands him a very large sum of gold money, the money that Richard declined to kill the prisoners. He also awards him a special sword worthy of a Knight Templar. The money allows him to fulfill the plans he has with the new kingdom. After returning to Sweden along with a group of people from the Holy Land (among them two Armenian craftsmen, two Englishmen specializing in crossbows and longbows, glass workers, felt makers, copper smiths and two learned Saracen physicians), Arn has great plans for his childhood home, Arn√§s, and Forsvik, the estate which was to be his before he was forced into service as a Templar. He explains his idea of \\"building for peace\\" by constructing a modern castle at Arn√§s and to create a manufacturing centre at Forsvik. Arn starts training several young men and boys to become knights (or at least a competent cavalry force) at Forsvik. When he returns to his family, they are at first overwhelmed with a joy that soon cools when he voices his desire to marry Cecilia. His family wishes to use him for a political marriage, but due to the intrigues of Cecilia and her friend the Queen they are soon after married, earning them the enmity of Birger Brosa. After a little time they have a daughter together and Forsvik grows rapidly. However his newfound luck is shattered when King Sverker attempts to kill the sons of the late King Knut. Commanding his force of cavalry, he defeats the king's soldiers at the Battle of √Ñlgar√•s. He also takes command at the Battle of Lena and emerges victorious. Two years later, when King Sverker returns once again with a Danish army and Arn commands the forces of King Erik at the Battle of Gestilren. He takes a fatal wound while pushing forward to kill King Sverker, he succeeds in this and the battle is won. He dies of his wounds a few days later, now aged 60, and is buried in Varnhem monastery.

This book follows the fictional character of Arn Magnusson as a Knight Templar in the kingdom of Jerusalem. The book starts in Arn's 27th year and ends as he departs the holy lands. At the age of 27, Arn is already a veteran in the Crusader army, when he faces the strangest experience a Knight Templar can have. While pursuing a band of saracen thieves, he comes across Saladin, the leader of the Muslim forces, and saves his life. They become close friends, but great enemies at the same time. During the conversation with Saladin, Arn learns and deduces that Saladin is preparing an attack on the Kingdom of Jerusalem from the south and brings this information back to Jerusalem. As Arn is the commander of the Templar fort at Gaza, he prepares to take the first blow of Saladin's force, hoping to at least delay Saladin, so that Jerusalem maybe saved, as the King's army at the time is busied with a campaign in the far north. After a short siege Saladin spares the city, in part due to Saladin's life being saved by Arn earlier, as he is going for a bigger prize, the city of Jerusalem. Arn is given the order to march with all manpower to break the siege of Ascalon. Arn and his men manage a surprise attack, and together with the knights inside the city they completely crush the siege force. Even though both the Grand Master and two senior Templars are present in Ascalon, command of the Templar forces to pursue Saladin is given to Arn, due to his recent battle luck, seen as the will of God. Saladin still unaware of the broken siege is taken completely by surprise as the Templars charge on his center force in cover of dense fog, and trap the bulk of the Mamluk cavalry in a trench, utterly defeating Saladin's army at the Battle of Montgisard. When Arnaud de Toroge is named Grand Master of the Knights Templar, Arn is summoned to Jerusalem to become Master of the city where he and the Grand Master pursue a religiously tolerant policy with the goal of creating a lasting peace between Christians and Muslims. After the death of de Toroge, assassinated by Heraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, Gerard of Ridefort is named new Grand Master, and Arn is immediately dismissed from the city and retakes his position in Gaza. Arn now becomes disillusioned by the crusades and in the Battle of Hattin, Arn is severely wounded and spends several weeks at Saladin's hospital in Damascus. He then becomes a personal advisor to Saladin and convinces Saladin to spare the population of Jerusalem, which is conquered (in 1187). Also in Saladin's captivity is Gerard of Ridefort, who, by \\"persuasion\\", signs Arn's release note from the order. In the very end of the book, Richard the Lionheart comes to Palestine with an army of crusaders. Richard captures Acre from Saladin, and when Saladin tries to buy back 5,700 prisoners from him, Richard prefers to massacre the populace instead, because some terms had not been fulfilled. Arn is now very eager to return home, and Saladin donates to Arn the remaining sum of money which the Lionheart forsook in his lust for blood. As is told in the following book, Arn travels to Acre, on the way hiring various craftsmen, then obtains a Templar cargo ship and departs for his homeland. Meanwhile, Arn's fianc√©e, Cecilia Algotsdotter, is serving an equally long punishment (20 years) in a convent of Gudhem for the sins she and Arn committed at the age of 17. Gothia is plunged into a civil war over the crown, fought over by the Sverker clan, and the joined forces of the Erik- and Folkung clan. Cecilia being counted as a member of the latter is continuously bullied by the women at the convent, who are all of the Sverker clan. She is later joined by another Cecilia who is of the Erik clan. They thensforth named Cecilia Rosa (Algotsdotter) and Cecilia Blanka, due to their hair colours. Together they outlast the torture of the Sverkers, and especially the Abbess Rikissa, who spare no effort in punishing the two friends. Relief comes as the Eriks and the Folkungs finally defeat the Sverkers at the battle of Bjelbo. Cecilia Blanka, who is the fianc√©e of the future King, Canute I Ericson begins to haunt the Abess with her coming power, which finally breaks the persistent torture of the two. The two also befriend a young Sverker maid, Ulvhilde Emundsdotter, ironically the daughter of the man who was famously defeated by Arn Magnusson and later slain by Canute. The three form a lifelong friendship and with their wit and cunning eventually become a ruling force in the nation (more so in the following books).

Daboll, granted June 26, 1860 A Daboll trumpet is an air trumpet foghorn which was developed by an American, Celadon Leeds Daboll, of New London, Connecticut. It was basically a small coal-fired hot air engine, which compressed air in a cylinder on top of which was a reed horn. The Daboll trumpet, consists of a steel reed vibrating within a horn, which uses the hot air engine to force cold air by means of an air pump into a boiler, from which it escapes into the horn through a valve, causing the vibrations of the reed, which are regulated by an automatic cam. Daboll's cousin, Charles Miner Daboll (1823-), inventor of the Daboll bushing, is credited with developing the Daboll trumpet for practical use. The following citation is from: Scientific American Supplement, Vol. XIX, No. 470, Jan. 3, 1885. > The Daboll trumpet was invented by Mr. C.L. Daboll, of Connecticut, who was > experimenting to meet the announced wants of the United States Lighthouse > Board.

It is the second of three episodes featuring Jim Norton as Bishop Len Brennan. Synopsis The episode begins with a self-referential \\"Father Ted\\" mock title sequence with \\"Ted\\" being replaced by \\"Ben\\" and the title's font also being slightly changed, which then cuts to Dougal sitting in front of the television shouting excitedly to Ted that the programme is starting. Each comments on the spoof character representing themselves, Dougal saying that Brendan is \\"an eejit\\" and Ted making fun of Ben for being \\"a big thicko\\". The original Father Ted titles follow. Dougal gets a pet rabbit which, after much deliberation, he calls Sampras, because of \\"that whole tennis-rabbit connection\\". Meanwhile, Jack has acquired a habit of sleepwalking naked, and Bishop Brennan, after contacting Ted, is set to visit to inspect the security arrangements after one of his friends was frightened by seeing Jack naked. Unfortunately, the bishop has a fear of rabbits due to a bad experience he once had with some in a lift, which means Ted and Dougal must get Sampras out of the way before he visits. They fail, and the situation is exacerbated as more and more rabbits gradually appear in the parochial house, apparently from nowhere. Ted and Dougal then resort to desperate measures to hide the army of rabbits, such as hiding them at the local greyhound track, trying to give them to their accident-prone friend Father Larry Duff (who now has some Rottweilers) and getting Tom, the local psychopath, to look after them, all to no avail. The bishop soon arrives, and Ted shows him the security arrangements for Jack (which involve a cage and barbed wire around his bed and straitjacket pyjamas, as well as a tracking device and cameras). In the conversation, the Bishop notices a rabbit hutch filled with lettuce on the floor (Ted tells him that they grow lettuce indoors in a cage), rabbit droppings on the carpet (which Ted says is caviar) and Mrs. Doyle walking in with water and lettuce (Ted takes the bowl, gulps the water and eats the lettuce), all of which prompt the bishop to go to bed. Ted then realises that Dougal left the rabbits in the spare bedroom, where Brennan is sleeping, but after distracting the bishop, they discover that they are not there, having followed Jack into his room. However, while Ted's back is turned, Jack circumvents the security measures and escapes, and the rabbits follow. Ted notices a rabbit entering the spare bedroom, and he and Dougal tiptoe in to get the rabbits back out. Unfortunately the bishop wakes up and turns on the light to find himself surrounded by rabbits, as well as a nude Jack next to him in his bed. Ted tells Brennan that it is just a \\"bad dream\\", and the bishop lays back down to sleep (accompanied by Jack also laying back down), only to wake up again seconds later loudly screaming in horror, having realised what is happening.  Popular culture  * This episode contains a subtle reference to Pulp Fiction: Tom chooses between a hammer, baseball bat, chainsaw and katana to kill the rabbits, just as Butch in Pulp Fiction chooses between these weapons to fight Zed and Maynard. Also, one of the Rabbits apparently looks like Harvey Keitel. * On the wall at the back of the room where Tom is showing the priests how he will take care of the rabbits, a section of the word \\"Redrum\\" can be seen - this is a reference to elements from the film The Shining: \\"Redrum\\" is a reverse-spelling of \\"murder\\".

He served as the director of the Iranian Archeological Service for many years. Life Godard was born in Chaumont. A graduate of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts of Paris, he studied Middle Eastern archaeology, particularly that of Iran, and later became known for designing the National Museum of Iran, where he was appointed inaugural director in 1936. He was also instrumental in the design of Tehran University campus. He made his first trip to the Middle East in 1910 with Henri Violle. Together, they began to excavate the ancient ruins of Samarra, located in modern-day Iraq. The ruins were fully excavated a few years later by German- born archaeologist Ernst Herzfeld. Godard returned to his architectural studies in 1912, focusing on Islamic architecture of Egypt. After World War I, Godard married Yeda Reuilly. The Delegation of French Archaeology in Afghanistan was subsequently founded in 1922, so Godard and his new wife accompanied the organization to not-yet-excavated regions. They consequently studied B√¢miy√¢n, which was later permitted to be exhibited at the central Buddhist shrine of the Guimet Museum, in 1925. In 1928, Godard was granted the directorship of Iranian Archeological Services, by the authority of Reza Shah. The IAS was intended to mark the end of French monopoly over excavation in Iran. As such, Godard focused on the politics of conservation, and held the title of Director from 1928-1953, then again from 1956-1960. Reza Shah also appointed him director of the National Museum of Iran (Muze-ye Ir√¢n-e BƒÅstƒÅn). During his tenure, Godard was responsible for the restoration of major historic monuments of Iran, such as the Friday Mosque, the Shah Mosque, and Mosque of Sheikh Lutfallah of Isfahan among others. Using his directorships, he organized large excavations of bronzes of Luristan, Persepolis and Isfahan. He was also instrumental, together with fellow architect Maxime Siroux, in the design of the National Library of Iran, Tomb of Hafez, and Central Pardis, the main campus of the University of Tehran. During World War II Godard opposed the Vichy government of France and when the Vichy diplomatic representatives were expelled from Tehran in 1942, helped form the Free France Committee and later become the official diplomatic representative of the provisional government in Tehran. In this period his wife Yedda organized an information radio program on Free France which was broadcast on the Persian radio. Godard returned to Paris in 1960, where he continued to write on Iranian art. He died in Paris on 31 July 1965.

In Doughty's first two games for Michigan (also Schembechler's first two games as Michigan's head coach), he rushed for 138 yards (including an 80-yard touchdown run on his first carry)(\\"Glenn Doughty, carrying the ball for the first time, reeled of an 80-yard touchdown run.\\") in a 42‚Äì14 win against Vanderbilt and 191 yards in a 45‚Äì7 win against Washington. Doughty sustained injuries early in the season that slowed him down and allowed Billy Taylor to move from backup to starting tailback. Doughty did rush for 100 yards one more time during the 1969 season, in a 51‚Äì6 win against Iowa. He totaled 732 yards for the 1969 Michigan Wolverines football team. Doughty sustained an injury on Christmas Day while practicing for the 1970 Rose Bowl. Doughty was moved to the wingback position and started all 12 games at that position for the 1970 and 1971 Michigan Wolverines football team. He scored three touchdowns in a 35‚Äì6 victory over Illinois in October 1971. After the 1971 season, Doughty was selected by UPI as a second-team wide receiver on the 1971 All-Big Ten Conference football team. Doughty was selected to play on the 1972 Coaches All American and College All Star Team as the starting wide receiver. Doughty graduated from Michigan in 1972 with a bachelor of science degree in education. Professional football Doughty played professional football as wide receiver for the Baltimore Colts from 1972 to 1979. He appeared in 103 games for the Colts, totaling 219 receptions for 3,547 yards and 24 touchdowns. He earned the nickname \\"Shake and Bake\\" during his years with the Colts, and the nickname was also extended to the 1975 Baltimore Colts offense. In 1979, Doughty left the team for two days claiming that he was being subtly downgraded by Colts' coach Ted Marchibroda. The Baltimore Afro-American referred to the Colts' treatment of Doughty as \\"business as usual at Memorial Stadium,\\" noting that Raymond Chester had complained the prior year that \\"an attitude of racism\\" on the Colts caused quarterback Bert Jones to \\"look away\\" from him. Doughty was cut by the Colts in August 1980 after struggling during the pre-season with a hamstring pull. He was the sixth leading receiver in Colts' history when his NFL career ended. Shake and Bake Family Fun Center After retiring from the Colts, Doughty announced plans to build the Shake and Bake Family Recreation Center in the Upton neighborhood of Baltimore. The project was supported by a $3.5 million loan from the City of Baltimore. Disputes over financing jeopardized the project in 1982, and disputes with construction workers also drew press coverage. The project was ultimately built with $4.7 million in development loans from the City of Baltimore, $150,000 invested by Doughty, and $1.2 million invested by four limited partners. When the project, renamed the Shake and Bake Family Fun Center, opened in October 1982 managed by Doughty came in on time and under budget, Doughty called it a dream come true and \\"my Super Bowl ring\\". The $5.2 million project was described by the Baltimore Afro-American as \\"Doughty's gift to the inner city.\\" The structure included a 40-lane bowling alley, a roller-skating rink, a sporting goods store, an \\"electronic game arcade,\\" and two fast-food restaurants. In February 1984, Black Enterprise magazine wrote a story on the center, noting that the center had grossed $1 million in its first year and received 10,000 visits per week. The article concluded: \\"The complex is such a success that mayors from large cities around the U.S., studying inner city revitalization programs, have visited it.\\" In January 1985, shootings at the center and financial difficulties drew negative press to the project. After loan delinquencies mounted in 1987 Doughty and his limited partners sold the facility to the City. . In 2017 Shake and Bake was featured in \\"Baltimore: The Rise of Charm City\\" a radio series by WEAA of Morgan State University that described Shake and Bake as \\"one of Baltimore's iconic structures that was built by African Americans and founded by Glenn Doughty\\". Over one million patrons have passed through the center over the thirty years of operation. On March 23, 2018 Mayor Cathy Pugh and Glenn Doughty joined together with state dignitaries and citizens from the Upton neighborhood celebrated the grand reopening of Shake and Bake. The theme was \\"The Bake is Back\\". The city of Baltimore and the state of Maryland committed nearly $5 million in new funding to upgrade the center. The 17,000 sq. ft. Roller rink is considered by many to be the best in the nation. Later years In 1985 Doughty moved with his family to St. Louis, Missouri. He co-founded a company called Takeoff Video Educational Excellence. The company produced videos designed to show positive multicultural role models for use in schools. In 1994, Takeoff was reorganized as Career Information Training Network. Doughty is the company's CEO.

The game is the first in the Railroad Tycoon series. An expanded version of the game titled Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon Deluxe, was released in 1993. A port of the game for the Super NES was planned for a 1994 release, and screenshots were shown in the March 1993 issue of Nintendo Power; however the port was never released. Though no reason was officially given,http://www.snescentral.com/article.php?id=0830 it may have been due to the DOS release of Transport Tycoon, and its planned release on the then- upcoming PlayStation console.http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps/573902-transport- tycoon/data The DOS version of the game was released as freeware for download in 2006.Sid Meier's Railroads - Downloads  Gameplay  The objective of the game is to build and manage a railroad company by laying tracks, building stations, and buying and scheduling trains. The player acts as a railway entrepreneur and may start companies in any of four geographic locales: the Western United States, Northeast United States, Great Britain, or Continental Europe. The company starts with one million dollars in capital, half equity, half a loan. The company may raise additional capital through the sale of bonds. The player manages the business as described above and may also handle individual train movement and build additional industries. The game models supply and demand of goods and passengers as well as a miniature stock market on which players can buy and sell stock of their own or competing companies. The game also has other railroad companies attempting to put the player out of business with stock dealings and rate wars. There are four types of stations: Signal Tower, Depot, Station and Terminal. The Signal Tower acts as a passing loop and may control movements. The rest service surrounding areas: the Depot serves its own square and the adjoining eight squares, the Station takes another ring, and the Terminal handles up to three squares away. The player can build at most 32 stations. When the player builds the first station they also build their first engine shop. Each engine shop is the manufacturing area for the player's different trains. The player can upgrade and downgrade Depots, Stations and Terminals. Other facilities such as stores and hotels may be added. Once the player builds a station they can build their first train (of the 32 permitted) at any engine shop. The player then can add cars to the train and send it on its way. The player can at any time change the consist, with options including pure mail and passenger cars as well as specialized freight cars for each of the game's nine other commodity types. The player can continue to build the track network and build stations until they run out of funds. The game runs for a century (1830 - 1930 and 1866 - 1966 in America and 1900 - 2000 in Europe), with accounting periods being two years long. Stations built or rebuilt in a particular accounting period pay the player double freight rates for everything they purchase in that period. Not every station buys everything offered to it. Some goods producers buy nothing. There are two alternatives the player can choose between: Simple Economy (where, for example, a station serving two or more cities will buy anything) and Complex Economy (where \\"two cities\\" will buy mail, passengers, and a couple of other products; \\"four villages\\" will buy passengers and different freight products; only a station with a steel mill will buy coal; and other products have other buyer types). There are product variations over the four geographical scenarios.  Reception  Railroad Tycoon sold more than 400,000 units by September 1997. On its release in 1990 Railroad Tycoon was hailed by reviewers as one of the best games of the year. In 1990 Computer Gaming World gave the game five out of five stars, named it as its Game of the Year, and in 1992 added it to the magazine's Hall of Fame for games that readers highly rated over time. Both the PC version of Railroad Tycoon and the Macintosh version were rated 5 out of 5 stars by Dragon. It won the 1991 Software Publishers Association Excellence in Software Award for Best Strategy Program. The editors of Strategy Plus declared it their 1990 game of the year. In 1991, PC Format named Railroad Tycoon one of the 50 best computer games ever. In 1994, PC Gamer US declared it the fourth best computer game ever. In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared Railroad Tycoon the 41st-best computer game ever released. In 1998, PC Gamer US declared it the 25th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it \\"groundbreaking in every sense\\".

Synopsis Ted bets the entire year's heating allowance for the parochial house on the King of the Sheep competition, placing his bet on Chris, a sheep who has won several times and is considered a sure thing. Unfortunately, Chris has heard rumours about a sheep-eating beast and isn't feeling at all himself. With a very cold winter forecast for the year, Ted becomes very worried about the possibility of losing the bet. He goes to John and Mary, asking for his bet money back, but they refuse. Chris's owner, Fargo Boyle, comes to the parochial house and begs Ted to help return Chris to his old self. After a week, Ted has successfully returned Chris's spirit. However, after he and Dougal hear sounds in the night and, upon investigation, discover a stereo in a tree, Ted finds out that Boyle arranged for Chris to be frightened by the beast (thanks to an album of BBC Sound Effects) in order to increase the meagre odds being offered for his victory. On the day of the competition, just as Chris is about to be declared the winner, Ted makes a dramatic scene and exposes the whole plot, telling the judge his observations, including expensive items being worn by the other contestants (after Fargo paid them to spread rumours about the beast) and Fargo leaving a shop with a BBC Sound Effects record that Dougal had wanted to buy - the judge is appalled to hear about this plot, and Chris is instantly disqualified. Fargo begs Chris's forgiveness, but the sheep is apparently unforgiving. Although Ted makes a dramatic exit, he is left kicking himself when Dougal points out that because Chris was disqualified, he has lost the bet, and thus all of the heating allowance money - subsequently, the residents of the parochial house prepare themselves to hibernate for the extremely cold winter that is soon due. =The Beast of Craggy Island= Ted and Dougal proved that the \\"Beast\\" was a hoax created by Giant Reed and Hud Hastings to rig the \\"King of the Sheep\\" competition. Dougal, Mrs. Doyle and Hud all give a description of the Beast: * It has claws as big as cups (Dougal) * It has four ears, two for listening and two \\"are sort of back-up ears\\". Some might be on the inside of its head (Dougal) * It has a retractable leg so it \\"can leap up at you better\\" (Dougal) * It has magnets on its tail, so \\"if you're made out of metal, it can attach itself to you\\" (Dougal) * It lights up at night (Dougal) * It has a tremendous fear of stamps (Dougal) * Its yawn sounds like Liam Neeson chasing a load of hens around inside a barrel (Dougal) * It has no mouth, but instead has four arses (Dougal) * It only has eyebrows on Saturdays (Dougal) * It lives \\"on the place where there should be moors\\" (Mrs. Doyle) * It makes a \\"terrible howling noise\\" (Mrs. Doyle) * It is the size of a jaguar [the cat not the car] (Hud) * It has big white teeth, as sharp as knives (Hud) The \\"terrible howling noise\\" was due to a stereo placed in a tree by Giant and Hud to trick the locals into believing in the existence of the \\"Beast\\". The \\"Beast\\"'s other features were just rumours spread by Giant and Hud. Trivia * This episode shows that Dougal is forced by Ted to keep a list of things (named, appropriately enough, 'They Don't Exist') that don't exist which lists the following: ** Loch Ness Monster ** Frankenstein (although presumably Dougal is actually referencing Frankenstein's monster). ** Magnum, P.I. ** Non-Catholic Gods ** Darth Vader ** The Phantom of the Opera ** The Beast of Craggy Island * This episode is notable as being the only episode in the entire series to contain the word 'Fuck' spoken uncensored (it is heard twice, when \\"Fuckin' Hell\\" is exclaimed off-camera by Graham Linehan while others express shock at Ted's revelations about the Beast). In other episodes, minced oaths such as \\"Feck\\" are used instead. * This episode inspired Australian Sue Dowling in September 2015 to give the name \\"Chris\\" to a sheep she spotted in a paddock in Canberra that had an unusually large fleece. The fleece was shorn and set a world record for the heaviest fleece. * The title for this episode is a play on words of the title of the 1971 song \\"Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep\\", made famous by Middle of the Road.

The episode's title and some of the scenes are a parody on the movie Night of the Living Dead.  Synopsis  Mrs Doyle, as well as several other middle-aged women, are devoted fans of the boyish and dimwitted television presenter and pop superstar Eoin McLove. Eoin holds a contest for the best ode to him, offering a visit to the winner. Mrs Doyle's poem is announced as the winner, and she eagerly prepares for his visit. While shopping, one of her friends, Mrs Boyle, asks when Eoin will be arriving. Mrs Doyle admits it is supposed to be a secret, but tells her it will be that Sunday, and ask she not tell anyone else. Mrs Boyle promises, but quickly goes back on her word, and news of Eoin's arrival quickly spreads around Craggy Island. Eoin arrives at the parochial house along with his assistant Patsy. Mrs Doyle is overly nervous about meeting Eoin, while Eoin seems more disinterested and wants to know when the visit will be over. As the night draws on, Ted discovers that numerous middle-aged women have congregated outside the house, all wanting to see and touch Eoin. They become so dense as to make it impossible for Eoin or Patsy to leave, and Ted offers them to stay the night. During the night, the women wander around outside the house like zombies, while Eoin's childish behaviour (including eating jam directly from the jar and claiming that Jack \\"smells of wee\\") rubs Ted, Dougal, and Jack the wrong way. He even slights Mrs Doyle by rejecting the gift of a jumper she had baked into a banana cake for him. The women are still outside the next morning, staring through the windows at Eoin sleeping in one of the chairs. Ted tries to wave them away, but they compliment him on his last mass, and Ted absent-mindedly opens the window to talk to them clearly. The women enter the house and start approaching Eoin. Ted, Dougal, Eoin and Patsy flee to the upstairs bathroom but are followed by the mass of women. As they start to grab at Eoin, a rooster's call is heard, as day has broken. Mrs Doyle and Ted remind the women that their husbands will be getting up and will be wanting breakfast soon, and they best return their homes if they don't want any disasters to befall them. The women quickly funnel out and leave. Eoin prepares to leave, and gives Mrs Doyle a peck on the cheek, causing her to faint. Patsy, knowing from Mrs Doyle that Ted wants to be on television, offers him an opportunity to guest on one of Eoin's shows. Later, during this show, Eoin quizzes Ted on William Shatner's TekWar, Ted's favourite book, for a cash prize.

Life He was born Giovanni Francesco Carrieri in the city of Mantua some time around 1420.The source for this name was in Spanish, and gave Matthew Carrieri's original name as Juan Francisco. It may be reasonable to assume then, that, being Italian, his name would be Giovanni Francesco. He took the name Matthew when he entered the Dominican Order. His later success as a preacher was inarguable, attributable to the significant time he spent in spiritual exercises and meditation between preaching.Butler's Lives of the Saints One of the major events in Carrieri's life was his capture by a Turkish corsair, while on a voyage from Genoa to Pisa.For an account of this story in Carrieri's life, see Mores Catholici, Or, Ages of Faith by Kenelm Henry Digby (pp. 347-348). When asked to explain their purpose for being on board the ship, Carrieri spoke up so forcefully and convincingly, that the captain set him and the two friars accompanying him free. The friar then saw that the pirates were still keeping a woman and her daughter captive, planning to sell them into slavery in Algeria. He proposed to the captain that they keep him in their place. So shocked was the pirate captain by Carrieri's willingness to sacrifice himself, that he freed all five captives. Carrieri was a very close associate of a noted Dominican tertiary, Stephana de Quinzanis, in her youth. He was responsible for her catechesis, and predicted that she would be his \\"spiritual heiress.\\" The meaning of this statement was illuminated when Stephana also began to experience pains similar to Carrieri's, which, according to those concerned, were the result of his devotion to the Passion of Christ. Carrieri's hagiography states that on 5 October 1470 he asked his superior for permission to die, and upon receiving this, he died. Veneration In 1482, Pope Sixtus IV authorized the solemn transfer of Matthew's relics and allowed formal liturgical celebration of Blessed Matthew Carrieri's cultus.

It is a popular location for ramblers and hiking along the cliffs to Llantwit Major beach. The lighthouse meadow is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, containing rare plants such as the tuberous thistle, and other wildlife such as choughs can be seen. Nash Point Nash Point Lighthouse with Fog Horn House in foreground Parts of the section of the Glamorgan Heritage Coast where the lighthouse stands consists of \\"cliffs of Lias limestone interbedded with softer erodible material\\" and has been identified as potentially at risk from erosion and flooding. Many fossils, including ammonites and gryphaea are to be found there. Marcross Brook passes through the cliffs and an Iron Age hillfort, usually called Nash Point Camp, stands on the north side of the brook, although its remains have been largely eroded by the sea. Round barrows are also to be found nearby. A study of the rocks shows that they exemplify \\"a 12,000 year old sequence of tufa, scree and slope deposits containing abundant fossil snails\\", while the Nash Bank offshore is formed by \\"Jurassic mudstones overlain by bands of sand and gravel\\". Nash Point Lighthouse The Nash Point Lighthouse is a Grade II listed building, dating from 1831‚Äì32. There are two lights, a high light and a low light, located at a distance of around 300 metres from one another. The leading light was removed during the 1920s because of the shifting location of the Nash sandbank. The lighthouse was designed by James Walker, the chief engineer for Trinity House. Its construction is said to have been spurred by the wreck of The Frolic on the Nash Sands in March 1831, which resulted in over 50 deaths, including that of Lt-Col N McLeod. The ship was on its way from Bristol to Haverfordwest. First lit in 1832, the lighthouse was electrified in 1968. Nash Point Lighthouse became the last manned lighthouse in Wales, and was automated in 1998. The lighthouse is now open to visitors, and is often used as a wedding venue; Trinity House provides public tours. The fog signal, no longer needed by ships, is sounded on the first Saturday and third Sunday of each month as an additional attraction to visitors. Currently, cottages around the lighthouse can be rented out as holiday accommodation. Shipwreck In 1962, the empty tanker BP Driver (formerly the BP Explorer, which had been rebuilt following a disaster in the River Severn) was pushed on the rocks and was abandoned by its crew of five, all of whom survived. Despite the assistance given by the lighthouse, the ship's captain was unable to bring her in safely to land. At low tide, remains of the wreck can be found about 200m north of the beach access by the light house.

The previous CD in the series, Pebbles, Volume 8 also features bands from Southern California; while Highs in the Mid- Sixties, Volume 1, Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 2, and Highs in the Mid- Sixties, Volume 3 showcase music from Los Angeles specifically. Release data This album was released on AIP Records in 1996 as #AIP-CD-5026 (although the disk is actually imprinted with the catalogue number of the previous volume). Despite the similar catalogue number, there is no relation between the tracks on this CD and the tracks on the corresponding LP. Notes on the tracks According to the liner notes, the track by the Standells had not been reissued before now; and this is probably the first-released version of the early Monkees hit \\"I'm Not Your Stepping Stone\\". One of the members of the Second Helping was Kenny Loggins, and this single is his earliest known release. The Velvet Illusions are actually not from California but were a Yakima, Washington based band; while often mentioned as having heiress Patricia Hearst's former boyfriend Steven Weed as a member, the band actually featured a different Steve Weed.Velvet Illusions The final track is from an unreleased acetate by the band that is best known for \\"I Never Loved Her\\" (included on the Pebbles, Volume 8 CD). The two songs by Fenwyck, \\"I Wanna Die\\" and \\"Iye\\" were produced by Zane Ashton (aka Bill Aken) who had founded Progressive Sounds of America in 1963 and recorded the two sides at Western Recorders in Hollywood, California. After an emotional breakdown when one of his artists 'Kathy Dee' suffered a stroke and died, he sold the label to the Quinlan Corporation and Jay Bonner with the stipulation that 'Fenwyck' would be the first record released under the new management. That is why the label says \\"Produced by Zane Ashton.\\" Ironically, although the new owners ridiculed him as being emotionally unstable, without its founder's love of rock and roll and his production instincts, the label died a very quick death and within a year was out of business.

Introduction to the contemporary art in Arab land. Baghdad: AuthorHouse; 1960. was one of the pioneers of Egyptian modern art from the second-wave such as Saeed elSadr (1909‚Äì1986) and Ahmed Osman. Hassan has been called Painter of the Epics and Philosophies by criticsMokhtar elAttar, 1998, Art Pioneers and Enlightenment Avant-garde in Egypt, Part Three (), Studies in fine-arts critique Series, Egyptian General Authority for The Book (), Cairo. and has been recognized by his colleagues for his strong adherence to Classical forms in Egyptian modern art. He has produced over 100 paintings some of which are on the large scale and most of which remain 'stored' with the family in his‚Äînow closed‚Äîresidence near the Pyramids in Cairo. He had authored 4 books in arts, history of art, philosophy of art, and arts and society. Born in Cairo in 1906 to a middle-class family with a Sufi Sheikh father, Hassan saw the early days of Egypt's semi-independence from Ottomans under British occupation. Typical of the vogue of the day at Cairo, he has been noted for his patriotism through the seeking of a modern identity of the nation embedded in both heritage and modernity. He died in Cairo on 30 March 1990, leaving three daughters and a son. His son Mohamed Hassan El-Feky followed his path and made a notable contribution to Egyptian contemporary art too.  Education He graduated on 1926, from the Egyptian School of Arts and Decoration (). In 1929, he was sent by the Ministry of Knowledge () to Czechoslovakia, then to Germany and Italy to what seems to have been a shift in his career perhaps as potential teacher in the Applied Arts. He studied techniques for the decoration of glass vessels. Always fascinated by fine arts, he has added learning of classical painting and anatomy to this by attending the nightly courses in the L'Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia. It seems that this was in the hands of a professor DiStefani who was highly praised by the painter at the time. His career was back to painting as a specialist in oil painting, human body anatomy, and classical structures and arts. Hassan could read, write and speak in English, Italian, French, and German in addition to Arabic his mother tongue. His library included books of literature, physical and social sciences, philosophy in different languages. He has been curious throughout his life and even at the age of 80 was investigating things such as the nature of black holes in this universe.  Career Hassan started his career after graduation on 1926, as illustrator for the American Schools of Oriental Research in Palestine where William F. Albright was working. He actively investigated the nature of his native country Egypt and its larger nation (the Arab world), the world, and the universe. Some of his early works illustrate folklore and dramatic scenes from Cairo streets. He participated in many expos in Egypt and abroad, but three exhibitions dedicated for his paintings stand out as important life landmarks: # In 1934 at the beginnings: Egypt Europe Exhibition # In 1954 at the height of his career: The Revolution Exhibition # In 1982 near the end: Hassan Mohamed Hassan Exhibition His curiosity to understand extended to cover many political causes including the independence of his own country, pan-Arabism, and specially the conflict in Palestine which he experienced himself during his assignment on 1926. =Teaching positions= In 1931, he came back from Italy to teach in High School of Applied Arts () which he ‚Äì with efforts of his colleagues ‚Äì transformed into a high Education College. This stage is one of his more profound stages of his paintings. In 1949, he was demoted from the College and transferred to a job as Inspector in Ministry of Education in which he spent 3 years. In 1952, he was re-instated by the Revolution committees and held his previous position in the College of Applied Arts (now affiliated with Helwan University) in which he continued teaching until he retired in 1966. After which he taught in the College for many years as Professor Emeritus. He reached the position of Professor and Chair of Art History, Aesthetics, and Painting Department for Higher Studies (). =Human universality and local causes= The subjects of Hassan's paintings reflect a deep concern of social and patriotic issues on a specific level as well as philosophically abstract ones. Emotions which could have been reflected through famous events, were rather drawn in ways which could be by any nation or any place in many of his works. He stripped the players and the place of any specific nation and still could convey the emotions of the situation. Other works have been still more abstract in subject and even theatrical in nature by showing very simple experiential situations which reflects appropriately the more intellectual riddles of this world. For instance, his large-scale painting Struggle of Life depicting a few humans around a fallen boulder summarizes humans positions around a crisis put in the form of boulder, and how the humans are dealing with it. Their dress or lack of it, reflect a universal form which could happen in any society. Another painting titled Nuclear Beast showing a blood-thirsty creature of the like of Alghol of the Arabian Nights put to gigantic levels and walking over ruins of civilization is another one. In his works, he focused on the impact of heroes rather than any specific one of them. Those who could be pioneers and impact their people and who could be belonging to any nation around the world. His heritage-based work, however, has come a long way by recognizing the ancient Egyptian, Islamic and modern folkloric symbols and sides to the culture. He used many such symbols specially in his later works. While philosophically his work may have reached and brought him recognition by the elite in Egypt and among his colleagues (and even recognition however limited in the little exposure he has had in Europe), it seemed always to address local concerns with much patriotism and solidarity with the weak. The conflict in Palestine was among the paramount issues, but also ones related to independence from the British as in one of his masterpieces with an unusually long title of Egypt Breaking Chains and Seeking Its Idol (). With all the attention which he gave to the subject, Hassan always introduced his actors in the painting in a dramatic context with dynamism with embodiment to human emotion (see his Scheherazade and Shahryar painting). He also gave attention to architecture in the backgrounds as one of the Classical Art teaching he received in Europe. His palette is persistently brown in most works, although had some occasionally blue in some of his early works (as in his Adam and Eve painting).

The degree can be awarded to students who have both technical education and traditional college/university education. Some universities also give credit for work-related training and certification completed by the student. Applied Arts and Sciences degree programs typically require a student to complete an academic core program consisting of English, History, Political Science, Philosophy and Sociology and the Sciences like Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry and Physics consisting of 40-60 semester credit hours. Technical coursework can count 30-60 credit hours, and in come cases, work experience and certifications are evaluated and up to 30 credit hours may be awarded towards a degree. Upper level academic credit hours make up 30-45 hours of coursework, depending on the program. Some programs include the declaration of a particular major or specialization. Others include several concentrations. A total of 120 semester hours is the typical total credit requirement for most Bachelor's degree programs in the United States.

History The BBC Russian Service began broadcasting on 26 March 1946. However, during World War II there were sporadic broadcasts to the Soviet Union in Russian only. Most of these broadcasts were after 1942. These were mainly short news bulletins or announcements relating to UK Foreign Office policy in Russian from 1943 onwards but often weeks or months apart. In the Cold War-era broadcasts were severely jammed. Despite this, it tried to bring to listeners in Soviet Union information they were deprived of, including works of writers and dissidents who could not publish their work at home, such as Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Jamming finally stopped in the late 1980s, as perestroika took hold. Broadcasting The BBC Russian Service has moved all its operation to the Internet, halting radio broadcasting after 65 years on air. Before the final decision to concentrate on online production the Russian Service radio was available only on AM. The BBC Russian Service partnered with Bol'shoe Radio (), an FM broadcaster in Moscow between April and August 2007. Daily broadcasts alternated between the Russian Service and Radio Moscow. On 17 August 2007 Bol'shoe Radio notified the BBC World Service that it planned to stop transmission of BBC programming in Russian as of that afternoon. BBC content was not aired as usual at 1700 (Moscow time); the station was ordered by its owner, the financial group Finam, to pull the shows or risk being taken off air altogether. The BBC planned to appeal against the decision.BBC loses last Russian FM outlet, Maria Esposito, The Guardian, 17 August 2007 In its 2007 Foreign and Commonwealth Office Annual Report the House of Commons' Foreign Affairs Committee concluded that \\"the development of a partnership with the international arm of a Russian state broadcasting network puts the BBC World Service's reputation for editorial independence at risk\\".2007 Foreign & Commonwealth Office Annual Report, the House of Commons' Foreign Affairs Committee, November 2007 Masha Karp, Martin Dewhirst, Victor Suvorov, Vladimir Bukovsky, Oleg Gordievsky criticized the BBC Russian service for giving less coverage to viewpoints outside of those approved by the Russian government.BBC plays by the Kremlin's Rules, Masha Karp, November 2010, Standpoint MagazineLetter to the Editorial Complaints Unit of the BBC from Martin Dewhirst, Department of Slavonic Studies, University of Glasgow and Viktor Suvorov, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Minutes of Evidence, 19 November 2007. The criticism ignored the fact that Alexander Litvinenko‚Äôs last interview from his hospital bed was with BBC Russian and it had featured a full spectrum of views about his death. An article in The Economist suggested that the BBC's desire to continue using local transmitters in Russia may conflict with its neutrality.The BBC's alleged kowtow, Economist, 19 July 2007. The BBC World Service denied it and said the problems it faced in acquiring carriage on FM in Russia emanated from the growing impact its distinctive programmes were having with audiences rather than weakening the quality of its output. They said it was the awkward journalistic questions the BBC had asked that inspired the authorities to bring persistent pressure to bear upon its FM partners to drop its programmes until the threat of losing their licences altogether became too strong. In November 2008 the BBC World Service announced a far-reaching strategy rethink, seeing most of the Russian Service's standalone news bulletins end and two blocks of current affairs programming widened. The strategy envisioned closure of longer, lighter feature programmes and aggregating some of their elements such as insights on British culture into a new weekend programme. The news drew sharp criticism from British experts on Russia who argued that the BBC World Service had weakened its editorial line under pressure from Kremlin and that it lost crucial links with British culture and political thought.World Service cuts: Reduction of the Russian service just a perverse concession to the Russian authorities, multiple authors, The Times, 7 November 2008 The BBC World Service responded that the changes were necessary to solidify radio output at peak audience times coupled with lack of FM frequencies throughout its target audience and restrictions imposed by the Russian Government. BBC World Service said that far from dropping analytical and cultural programming, as claimed, the BBC Russian service was strengthening the provision of journalism about politics and culture, and giving it space within high-profile programmes seven days a week at times when most listeners were available.

In 1975, after undergoing his second knee surgery in an 18-month span, he bounced back and played in all 14 games, starting one, gaining 177 yards on 58 attempts (a 3.1 average) with one touchdown and 25 receptions for 196 yards (a 7.8 average) and one touchdown. After eight seasons with the Bengals, during training camp prior to the 1976 season, the Bengals waived their career rushing leader on July 14, 1975 due to concerns about his knee. Johnson was selected by the Buccaneers in the 1976 NFL Expansion Draft. For the Bucs, he played in all 14 games, starting one, and gained 166 yards in 47 attempts (a 3.5 average) and one touchdown, with 25 receptions for 201 yards (a 14.4 average) and one touchdown. He was waived by the Bucs on February 25, 1977, ending his nine-year pro career. Personal life His son, Essex Johnson, was a star defensive end at Verbum Dei High School in Los Angeles where, as a junior, he recorded 96 tackles and eight sacks. During his senior season, he totaled 53 tackles playing defense, and on offense he rushed for 67 yards on 19 carries and caught eight passes for 107 yards. He also ran track and played basketball.http://fresnostate.scout.com/a.z?s=164&p;=9&c;=2&cid;=552929&nid;=2418367&fhn;=1&ssf;=1&RequestedURL;=http%3a%2f%2ffresnostate.scout.com%2fa.z%3fs%3d164%26p%3d9%26c%3d2%26cid%3d552929%26nid%3d2418367%26fhn%3d1 See also *List of American Football League players References Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Shreveport, Louisiana Category:Players of American football from Louisiana Category:American football running backs Category:Grambling State Tigers football players Category:Cincinnati Bengals players Category:Tampa Bay Buccaneers players Category:American Football League players ","title":"Essex Johnson"},{"id":"10543758","text":"Marconi Arcade is a side platformed Sacramento RT light rail station in Sacramento, California, United States.

Biography Gardner was born and raised in Dyersburg, Tennessee, the son of mother Johnnye Patterson. He attended Holice Powell School before graduating from Dyersburg High School. Gardner joined the Army from Memphis, Tennessee in 1964, and was stationed with the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He married Joella McManus in June 1965, a month before being sent to Vietnam. Later that year, after arriving in Vietnam, he helped to form and train Tiger Force, a task force of the division's 1st Battalion (Airborne), 327th Infantry Regiment, 1st Brigade, which specialized in the use of guerrilla tactics. On February 7, 1966, during Operation Van Buren, Gardner, then a first lieutenant in his brigade's Headquarters and Headquarters Company, led a platoon in the relief of a company that was pinned down by a strongly entrenched and numerically superior enemy force at the village of My Canh. During the assault on the enemy positions, he single-handedly attacked four bunkers. He was mortally wounded while approaching a fifth bunker, but managed to destroy it before succumbing to his injuries. For these actions, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. He was killed on his 23rd birthday, one month before his tour in Vietnam was to end. He was buried on February 15, 1966, at Fairview Cemetery in his hometown of Dyersburg. In addition to the Medal of Honor, Gardner also received the Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm, the Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart. During a ceremony at the Pentagon on October 19, 1967, Gardner's widow was formally presented with his Medal of Honor by Secretary of the Army Stanley Rogers Resor. The medal passed between Gardner's widow, mother, and sister until 2009, when it was donated to the 101st Airborne Division. On August 14, 2009, his sister, Lynda Gardner-Park, gave the Medal of Honor to his former unit to be displayed in the division's headquarters at Fort Campbell. The Army National Guard armory in Dyersburg is named in Gardner's honor.

Several patterns of associations with different consorts are identifiable. One pattern of myths identifies Ganesha as an unmarried brahmacƒÅrin with no consorts. Another mainstream pattern associates him with the concepts of Buddhi (intellect), Siddhi (spiritual power), and Riddhi (prosperity); these qualities are sometimes personified as goddesses who are considered to be Ganesha's wives.For a review of associations with Buddhi, Siddhi, Riddhi, and other figures, and the statement \\"In short the spouses of are the personifications of his powers, manifesting his functional features ...\\", see: . Another pattern connects Ganesha with the goddess of culture and the arts, Sarasvati. In the Bengal region he is linked with the banana tree, Kala Bo (or Kola Bou).For discussion of the Kala Bo, see: Cohen, Lawrence, \\"The Wives of \\", in: . Usually Ganesha's consort is portrayed as his shakti, a personification of his creative energy. He also may be shown with a single consort or a nameless servant (Sanskrit: ').For single consort or a nameless ' (servant), see: Cohen, Lawrence, \\"The Wives of \\", in: . Some of the differences between these patterns can be understood by looking at regional variations across India, the time periods in which the patterns are found, and the traditions in which the beliefs are held. Some differences pertain to the preferred meditation form used by the devotee, with many different traditional forms ranging from Ganesha as a young boy (Sanskrit: ; ') to Ganesha as a Tantric deity.For pictures of the 32 meditation forms along with the Sanskrit descriptions appearing in the ≈örƒ´tattvanidhi, see: and .For descriptions of the 32 meditation forms appearing in the ', see: Martin-Dubost, pp. 120‚Äì123. Unmarried According to one non-mainstream tradition, Ganesha was a brahmacƒÅrin, that is, unmarried.For statement that \\"According to ancient tradition, was a , that is, an unmarried deity; but legend gave him two consorts, personifications of Wisdom (Buddhi) and Success (Siddhi).\\", see: . This pattern is primarily popular in parts of southern India.Brown p.126 This tradition was linked to the controversial concept of the relationship between celibacy and the commitment to spiritual growth.Heras, p. 59. Heras quotes from Herbert's Ganesa, which says, \\"La couleur rouge de son corps est celle que donne aux grandes yogins la pratique intense de la meditation\\" (translation: The red color of his body is that which the intense practice of meditation gives to great Yogis). Bhaskaraya alludes to the tradition in which Ganesha was considered to be a lifelong bachelor in his commentary on the Ganesha Purana version of the Ganesha Sahasranama, which includes the name Abhƒ´ru (verse 9a).. (, 1991). Includes the full source text and the commentary by BhƒÅskararƒÅya in Sanskrit. In his commentary on this verse Bhaskaraya says the name Abhƒ´ru means \\"without a woman,\\" but the term can also mean \\"not fearful.\\"Apte, p. 720. Buddhi, Siddhi, and Riddhi The Ganesha Purana and the Mudgala Purana contain descriptions of Ganesha flanked by Siddhi and Buddhi.Mudgala Purana VI.9.8 and Ganesha Purana II.125.39, II.6.24, II.31.9. Citations for the Ganesha Purana are from the Yogindra Mata 1985 (Part II) editions. In these two Puranas they appear as an intrinsic part of GanapatiMudgala Purana VIII.43.26-7 and Ganesha Purana II.130.22. and according to ThapanThapan, pp. 192‚Äì193. do not require any special rituals associated with shakti worship. In Chapter I.18.24‚Äì39 of the Ganesha Purana, performs worship in honor of Ganesha, and during it Ganesha himself causes Buddhi and Siddhi to appear so that can offer them back to Ganesha. Ganesha accepts them as offerings.. In Ganesha Purana I.65.10‚Äì12 there is a variant of this incident, in which various gods are giving presents to Ganesha, but in this case Siddhi and Buddhi are born from 's mind and are given by to Ganesha. The Ganesha Temple at Morgaon is the central shrine for the regional complex. The most sacred area within the Moragaon temple is the sanctum ('), a small enclosure containing an image of Ganesha. To the right and left sides of the image stand Siddhi and Buddhi.Courtright, pp. 212‚Äì213. In northern India the two female figures are said to be Siddhi and Riddhi. There is no evidence for the pair, but the pairing parallels those of Buddhi and Siddhi in Shiva Purana and Riddhi and Buddhi from Matsya Purana.For statement , see: Cohen, Lawrence, \\"The Wives of \\", in: . =Interpretation of relationships= The has a story in which Ganesha and his brother Skanda compete for the right to marry the two desirable daughters of PrajƒÅpati, Siddhi and Buddhi, and Ganesha wins through a clever approach.' 2.5.19.15‚Äì20.

In Northern Indian variants of this story the sons are often said to be ' (Hindi Shubh) (auspiciousness) and '.Brown p.130 In discussing the Shiva Purana version, Courtright comments that while Ganesha is sometimes depicted as sitting between these two feminine deities, \\"these women are more like feminine emanations of his androgynous nature, Shaktis rather than spouses having their own characters and spouses.\\"Courtright, pp. 124, 213. \\"They are his ≈õaktis (the feminine emanations of his creative powers).\\" Ludo Rocher says that \\"descriptions of as siddhi-buddhi-samanvita 'accompanied by, followed by siddhi and buddhi.' often seem to mean no more than that, when is present, siddhi 'success' and buddhi 'wisdom' are not far behind.

In verse 49a of the Ganesha Purana version of the Ganesha Sahasranama, one of Ganesha's names is ≈ñddhisiddhipravardhana (\\"Enhancer of material and spiritual success\\"). The Matsya Purana identifies as the \\"owner\\" of Riddhi (prosperity) and Buddhi (wisdom).Matsya Purana 260.55. Edited by Jamna Das Akhtar (Delhi: Oriental Publishers, 1972), 310. In discussing the northern Indian sources, Cohen remarks: > \\"They are depersonalized figures, interchangeable, and given their frequent > depiction fanning are often referred to as dasƒ´s ‚Äî servants.

In the AjitƒÅgama, a Tantric form of Ganesha called Haridra Ganapati is described as turmeric-colored and flanked by two unnamed wives. The word \\"wives\\" (Sanskrit: ; ) is specifically used (Sanskrit: ; ).Macdonell, p. 118. These wives are distinct from shaktis.AjitƒÅgama Vol. III. 55.18. =Ashta Siddhi= Ganesha with the Ashta (8) Siddhi. The Ashtasiddhi are associated with Ganesha. ‚Äì painting by Raja Ravi Varma (1848‚Äì1906) Ganesha's relationship with the Ashtasiddhi ‚Äî the eight spiritual attaintments obtained by the practice of yoga ‚Äî is also of this depersonalized type. In later iconography, these eight marvellous powers are represented by a group of young women who surround Ganesha.Martin-Dubost, p. 332. Raja Ravi Varma's painting (shown in this section) illustrates a recent example of this iconographic form. The painting includes fans, which establish the feminine figures as attendants. In cosmopolitan ≈öƒÅkta worship of Ganesha, the are addressed as eight goddesses. In Ganesha Purana, these personified are used by Ganesha to attack demon Devantaka. These eight consorts are fused in a single devi, Ganesha's ≈õakti, according to Getty. She speculates as to whether the are a transformation of the with whom Ganesha is often sculpturally represented.Brown p.122 =Santoshi Ma= Ganesha was depicted as a householder married to Riddhi and Siddhi and the father of Santoshi Ma (Devanagari: ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§§‡•ã‡§∑‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Å), a new goddess of satisfaction, in the 1975 Hindi film Jai Santoshi Maa. The movie script is not based on scriptural sources. The fact that a cult has developed around the figure of Santoshi Ma has been cited by Anita Raina Thapan and Lawrence Cohen as evidence of Ganesha's continuing evolution as a popular deity.For discussion of the depiction of Ganesha in the film see: Cohen, Lawrence, \\"The Wives of \\", in: .Thapan, pp. 15‚Äì16, 230, 239, 242, 251. Buddhi (Wisdom) Ganesha is considered to be the Lord of Intelligence.Nagar, p. 5. In Sanskrit the word buddhi is a feminine noun that is variously translated as intelligence, wisdom, or intellect.Apte, p. 703. The concept of buddhi is closely associated with the personality of Ganesha as of the Puranic period, where many stories develop that showcase his cleverness and love of intelligence. One of Ganesha's names in the Ganesha Purana and in the Ganesha Sahasranama is Buddhipriya.Ganesha Purana I.46, v. 5 of the Ganesha Sahasranama section in GP-1993, Sharma edition. It appears in verse 10 of the version as given in the Bhaskararaya commentary. The name Buddhipriya also appears in a special list of twenty-one names that says are of special importance at the end of the Ganesha Sahasranama.Sharma edition, GP-1993 I.46, verses 204‚Äì206. The Bailey edition uses a variant text, and where Sharma reads Buddhipriya, Bailey translates \\"Granter-of-lakhs.\\" The word priya can mean \\"fond of\\" or in a marital context it can mean \\"a lover, husband\\",Practical Sanskrit Dictionary By Arthur Anthony MacDonell; p.187 (priya); Published 2004; Motilal Banarsidass Publ; so Buddhipriya means \\"fond of intelligence\\" or \\"Buddhi's husband\\".Krishan 1999; pp. 60‚Äì70 discusses Ganesha as \\"Buddhi's Husband\\". This association with wisdom also appears in the name Buddha, which appears as a name of Ganesha in the second verse of the Ganesha Purana version of the Ganesha Sahasranama.'. (, 1991). Includes the full source text and the commentary by BhƒÅskararƒÅya in Sanskrit. The name \\"Buddha\\" is in verse 7 of the volume cited, which corresponds to verse 2 of the ≈õasahasranƒÅma proper. The positioning of this name at the beginning of the Ganesha Sahasranama indicates that the name was of importance. Bhaskararaya's commentary on the Ganesha Sahasranama says that this name for Ganesha means that the Buddha was an avatar of Ganesha.Bhaskararaya's commentary on the name Buddha with commentary verse number is: \\"‡§®‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§¨‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡•Ç‡§™‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç ‡§Ö‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§µ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§®‡§æ‡§∂‡§®‡§É ‡•§ ‡§Ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ ‡§ú‡§ø‡§®‡§æ‡§µ‡§§‡§æ‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶‡•ç ‡§¨‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß ‡§á‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§≠‡§ø‡§ß‡•Ä‡§Ø‡§§‡•á ‡•• ‡•ß‡•´ ‡••\\" This interpretation is not widely known even among Ganapatya, and the Buddha is not mentioned in the lists of Ganesha's incarnations given in the main sections of the Ganesha Purana and Mudgala Purana. Bhaskararaya also provides a more general interpretation of this name as simply meaning that Ganesha's very form is \\"eternal enlightenment\\" (), so he is named Buddha. Motif of shaktis Ganesha in his form as MahƒÅganapati with a shakti. From the Sritattvanidhi (19th century). A distinct type of iconographic image of Ganesha shows him with a single human- looking shakti (Sanskrit: ').For prevalence of the motif of the single ', see: Cohen, Lawrence, \\"The Wives of \\", in: . According to Ananda Coomaraswamy, the oldest known depiction of Ganesha with a shakti dates from the sixth century.Coomaraswamy, Ananda. Bulletin of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts 26, no. 153 (1928): pp.30‚Äì31, cited in . The consort lacks a distinctive personality or iconographic repertoire. According to Cohen and Getty, the appearance of this shakti motif parallels the emergence of tantric branches of the Ganapatya cult. Getty mentions a specific cult of \\"Shakti Ganapati\\" that was set up by the Ganapatyas involving five distinct forms.For the cult of five ≈öakti-Ganapatis called , , , , and , see: . Of the thirty-two standard meditation forms for Ganesha that appear in the Sritattvanidhi (), six include a shakti.For depictions of Shakti Ganapati, Ucchista Ganapati, Mahaganapati, Urdhva Ganapati, Uddanda Ganapati, and Sankastharana Ganapati, see: . A common form of this motif shows Ganesha seated with the shakti upon his left hip, holding a bowl of flat cakes or round sweets. Ganesha turns his trunk to his own left in order to touch the tasty food. In some of the tantric forms of this image, the gesture is modified to take on erotic overtones.For discussion of examples of this form, see: Cohen, Lawrence, \\"The Wives of \\", in: . Some tantric variants of this form are described in the Tantram.Avalon. Section 13. An English translation of this section is also included in the introduction. Prithvi Kumar Agrawala has traced at least six different lists of fifty or more aspects or forms of Ganesha each with their specific female consorts or shaktis. In these lists of paired shaktis are found such goddess names as , etc. The names Buddhi, Siddhi, and Riddhi do not appear on any of these lists. The lists provide no details about the personalities or distinguishing iconographic forms for these shaktis. Agrawala concludes that all of the lists were derived from one original set of names. The earliest of the lists appears in the ' (I.66.124-38), and appears to have been used with minor variations in the . These lists are of two types. In the first type the names of various forms of Ganesha are given with a clear-cut pairing of a named shakti for that form. The second type, as found in the ' (II.IV.44.63‚Äì76) and the commentary of on the ≈öƒÅradƒÅtilaka (I.115), gives fifty or more names of Ganesha collectively in one group, with the names of the shaktis provided collectively in a second group. The second type of list poses problems in separating and properly connecting the names into pairs due to ambiguities in the formation of Sanskrit compound words.Agrawala. Appendix I: Multiple and their female ≈öaktis. Complete lists for all six variants identified by Agrawala are given in Appendix I in tabular form permitting easy comparison.Nagar, pp. 197‚Äì198. A list of fifty aspects as described in the ' that is similar to those identified by Agrawala.  Sarasvati and Lakshmi  Ganesha (centre), Lakshmi (left) and Sarasvati on a temple. Throughout India, on contemporary poster art, Ganesha is portrayed with Sarasvati (goddess of culture and art) or Lakshmi (goddess of luck and prosperity) or both.Brown p.129 Ganesha, Lakshmi and Sarswati are often grouped together as the divinities immediately responsible for material welfare. Ganesha and Saraswati share control over Buddhi (Wisdom), while Ganesha and Lakshmi are both deities of ·πúddhi and Siddhi (material and spiritual success). Brown p.133 Particularly in Maharashtra, Ganesha is associated with or Sarasvati. Some identify the two goddesses as the same person and thus the single consort of Ganesha while others consider them distinct and one or both of them as married to Ganesha.For associations with ≈öarda and Sarasvati, and the identification of those goddesses with one another, see: Cohen, Lawrence, \\"The Wives of \\", in: . Lakshmi's association with Ganesha is rarely tied with the Tantric tradition of Lakshmi as Ganesha's ≈õakti. Other reasons are variously offered for their relationship: their functional equivance and their joint worship on Diwali and in general by the \\"business community.\\" Brown p.133 Conversely, in Calcutta, Ganesha is said to be the brother of Sarasvati and Lakshmi.For Calcutta belief that Ganesha is the brother of Sarasvati and Lakshmi, see: see: Cohen, Lawrence, \\"The Wives of \\", in: .

Paul Martin-Dubost says that the etymology of the name KolƒÅbou is from kolƒÅ (banana) + bou (young bride).Martin-Dubost, pp. 88‚Äì90, 349. Uses the term \\"KolƒÅbou\\" for this tree. On the first day of Durga Puja the Kola Bou is draped with a red-bordered white sari and vermilion is smeared on its leaves. She is then placed on a decorated pedestal and worshipped with flowers, sandalwood paste, and incense sticks. The Kola Bou is set on Ganesha's right side, along with other deities. For most who view her, the new sari indicates her role as a new bride, and many Bengalis see it as symbolizing the wife of Ganesha. A different view is that the Kola Bou represents Durga herself, who in Bengal is considered the mother of Ganesha. Those who know of that tradition do not consider Ganesha's association with Kola Bou as a marital one. Haridas Mitra says that the Kola Bou is intended to serve as a symbolic summary for the nine types of leaves (nava patrika) that together form a sacred complex on Durga Puja.Mitra, Haridas. \\"Ganapati\\" Visva Bharati Annals 8 (n.d.):246. Cited by Cohen, Lawrence. \\"The Wives of \\". Brown, p. 124‚Äì125. Cohen says that the reference text \\"Vishnu Kosh\\" by Nogindranath Basu also identifies the Kola Bou with Durga herself. The officiating priests who carry out the ceremony tie a bunch of eight plants on the trunk of the plantain tree and it is the grouping of all nine plants that constitute the Kola Bou.A list of the constituent plants and method of assembly is given in Martin-Dubost, pp. 89‚Äì90. The nine plants all have beneficial medicinal properties. According to Martin-Dubost, the Kola Bou does not represent a bride or shakti of Ganesha, but rather is the plant form of Durga. He connects the plant symbol back to the festival enactment of Durga's return of the blood of the buffalo demon to the earth so that the order of the world may be re-established and luxuriant vegetation reappear. He links Ganesha to this vegetation myth and notes that Astadasausadhisristi (, \\"Creator of the eighteen medicinal plants\\") is a name of Ganesha.Ganesha Purana I.46.154 (1993 Sharma edition).

He was a part of the San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XVI winning team. Early life Elliot was born in Lexington, Missouri to Lenvil Nelson and Helen Constance (Williams) Elliott. He grew up in Richmond, Missouri and was a 1969 graduate of Richmond High School, where he participated in both football and track. His Richmond coach, Tom Adams, summed up Elliott's high school career reflecting on Elliott's final prep game by scoring all 19 points and running for 201 yards against a Slater team that had lost just one game: \\"It was a cold, nasty night and no one was real excited about playing,\\" Adams said. \\"Slater scored first and we came back and scored as Lenvil had a remarkable run, 66 yards from the goal, but he went all over the field. I can remember watching the film over and over, and counting the number of times a Slater player touched or tried to tackle him. The last five yards to the end zone he drug or carried a couple of guys trying to get him down. He was not about to lose his final game in a Spartan uniform.\\" Elliott was named to the All-State Team. College career He attended Northeast Missouri State University (now Truman State University) in Kirksville, Missouri, leading the Bulldogs to three consecutive Mid-American Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MIAA) titles. He became a starter at running back as a sophomore and earned honorable mention All-MIAA honors. He was a second-team choice as a junior, and landed on the first team as a senior when he gained 1,138 yards rushing, an average of 113.8 yards per game. His former coach, Russ Sloan, said Elliott was the first player he targeted upon taking over at the Kirksville school. \\"I thought at one point I had lost him to Texas-El Paso, but he called me at home and asked if he could still come to Northeast Missouri,\\" Sloan recalled. \\"I cannot begin to describe how awesome Lenvil was in his first full contact scrimmage as a freshman. I knew then that he was special, and in my playing career at Missouri I had not seen a better back in The Big 8. Lenvil could do it all. He was a great runner, solid blocker and a superb receiver out of the backfield. His 40 time was 4.3, and rarely was the first tackler able to bring Lenvil down.\\" Elliott also excelled at track. He was one of the Bulldogs' top sprinters as a senior, running a leg on the 440-yard relay team and finishing third in the MIAA outdoor triple jump. At NMSU, among his big games was when his three touchdowns led the Bulldogs to a 20-7 win to spoil Missouri State University's homecoming. He received a bachelor of arts degree in education in 1973. His football abilities and track speed in the 100-yard dash (about 9.6) attracted professional football scouts' attention. NFL career Elliott was drafted in the 10th round of the 1973 NFL Draft by the Cincinnati Bengals. He played running back for the Bengals from 1973 to 1979. Playing behind starting running backs Essex Johnson and Boobie Clark, his rookie year he saw action in only six games, but made the most of it with 122 yards in 22 carries (a 5.5 average) and one touchdown with one reception for a 12-yard touchdown. The Bengals posted a 10-4 record before losing in the first round of the AFC Playoffs to the eventual Super Bowl champion Miami Dolphins. The next season, 1974, was his most productive as he became a model of consistency for four seasons. In 10 games, he rushed for 345 yards in 68 carries (an outstanding 6.8 average) and one touchdown plus 18 receptions for 187 yards (a 10.4 average) and one touchdown. He also returned 13 kickoffs for 272 yards, a 20.9 average. In 1975, he rushed for 308 yards in 71 carries (a 4.3 average) with one touchdown and 20 receptions for 196 yards (a 9.8 average) and three touchdowns. He scored a post-season touchdown on a six-yard run in the third quarter of the Bengals' 24-14 loss to the Oakland Raiders. He followed that season, in 1976, with 276 yards in 69 carries (a 4.0 average) with 22 receptions for 188 yards (an 8.5 average) and tied his career-high of three receiving touchdowns. However, he fumbled five times. In 1977, he rushed for 269 yards on 64 carries (a 4.1 average) and 29 receptions for 238 yards (an 8.2 average) and one touchdown. That season, he had his longest career run of 32 yards. In 1978, he fell to 75 yards in 29 attempts (a 2.6 average) and 12 receptions for 100 yards (an 8.3 average). He was traded to the San Francisco 49ers in 1979. for whom he played from 1979 to 1981. In 1979, he rushed for 135 yards in 33 carries (a 4.1 average) and a career-high three rushing touchdowns. He also had 23 receptions for 197 yards (an 8.6 average). In 1980, his eighth NFL season, he came on strong with 341 yards in 76 carries (a 4.5 average) and two touchdowns with 27 receptions for a career-high 285 yards (a 10.6 average) and one touchdown. He also had the longest reception of his career, a 45-yard touchdown pass from Joe Montana in the third quarter to give the 49ers a 20-14 lead over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before finally falling 24-23. He was cut by the 49ers during the 1981 training camp, but then re- signed. During his ninth and final NFL season, he was hampered by a knee injury and had only 29 yards on seven carries (a 4.1 average) and seven receptions for 81 yards. In the 1981 postseason, he played a key role in the 49ers' NFC Championship Game victory over the Dallas Cowboys on January 10, 1982 at Candlestick Park after being activated just a week earlier after a knee injury. Elliott rushed four times for 31 yards on the 49ers' 89-yard final drive, culminating in \\"The Catch\\", Dwight Clark's famous six-yard touchdown reception from Joe Montana with 51 seconds left in the game. Elliott suited up but did not play (due to his knee injury) but he earned a Super Bowl ring in the 49ers' victory over his old team, the Cincinnati Bengals. Following Super Bowl XVI, he retired. He finished his career with 1,900 yards rushing, 1,484 yards receiving, and 18 total touchdowns (eight rushing and 10 receiving). Later life Following his retirement, Elliot returned to his hometown of Richmond, Missouri and was a member of the Laborers Union Local #1290. In 1989, he was inducted into the Truman State University Hall of Fame. Elliott died of a heart attack at 11:10 p.m., Sunday, October 12, 2008, at the Ray County, Missouri Memorial Hospital in Richmond. He was survived by a son, Lenvil O. Elliott II, a daughter, Melissa R. Elliott, grandsons James Kearney II and RaShaad Elliott, and his former wife and lifelong friend, Linda Elliott.

It premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the World Cinema Audience Award. In March 2008, it was the first film to win the Sir Arthur Clarke Award for Best Film Presentation. It was given a limited release in the United States on 7 September 2007, and in Canada on 19 October 2007.Calgary Sun, 19 October 2007 It was released on DVD in the United States on 22 February 2008, and 31 March 2008, in the United Kingdom. A Blu-ray edition was released on 16 June 2009. Synopsis The film follows the crewed missions to the Moon made by the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The documentary reviews both the footage and media available to the public at the time of the missions, as well as NASA films and materials which had not been opened in over 30 years. All of this has been sourced and remastered in HD by the stock footage company Footagevault. Augmenting the archival audio and video are contemporary interviews with some surviving Apollo era astronauts, including Alan Bean, Michael Collins, Buzz Aldrin, John Young, David Scott, Charlie Duke, Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt. The former astronauts have the only speaking roles in the film, although occasional supplementary information is presented on screen with text and archival television footage presents the words of journalists such as Jules Bergman and Walter Cronkite. The only surviving Moon walker at the time not to participate was Neil Armstrong, the first person to set foot on the Moon. The documentary shares its name with a book by space historians Colin Burgess and Francis French, and both include many original interviews with Apollo lunar astronauts. The documentary offers a view of the Apollo program that is complementary to the book and is neither a source nor a tie-in. Participants Ten former astronauts appear in In the Shadow of the Moon. During the Apollo Program, twenty-four men reached the vicinity of the Moon. Of the twelve who actually set foot on the lunar surface, eight appear on camera (Neil Armstrong did not participate, while Pete Conrad, James Irwin and Alan Shepard had died). Two other astronauts who are featured in In the Shadow of the Moon orbited around the Moon without landing (Jim Lovell and Michael Collins). All crewed Apollo flights with the exception of Apollo 7, which was an Earth-orbit mission, were represented in the film. The film is presented by Ron Howard, but there is no narration in the film. *Apollo 11: **Buzz Aldrin, Lunar Module Pilot **Michael Collins, Command Module Pilot *Apollo 12: **Alan Bean, Lunar Module Pilot *Apollo 13: **Jim Lovell, Commander (also Apollo 8 CMP) *Apollo 14: **Edgar Mitchell, Lunar Module Pilot *Apollo 15: **David Scott, Commander (also Apollo 9 CMP) *Apollo 16: **John Young, Commander (also Apollo 10 CMP) **Charles Duke, Lunar Module Pilot (also Apollo 11 CapCom) *Apollo 17: **Eugene Cernan, Commander (also Apollo 10 LMP) **Harrison Schmitt, Lunar Module Pilot Reception Critics gave the film very positive reviews.

Interest in Luz's work was revived around the time of the Cuban Revolution, and new editions of his work published, as he was regarded as a wellspring of intellectual autonomy for the country. Luz took his degree in philosophy in 1817 at the Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Ger√≥nimo in Havana, and took a degree in law at the Seminario de San Carlos. From 1837 to 1841, he travelled extensively in North America and Europe, meeting a number of important intellectuals of the time, including Sir Walter Scott, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Georges Cuvier, the German philosopher Karl Krause, and the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt. Krause paid a public tribute to Luz's scientific and philosophical views. With Humboldt, Luz arranged to establish a magnetic observatory in Cuba in correspondence with like institutions in Germany. bust of Jos√© de la Luz y Caballero on the grounds of the University of Havana campus. Caballero is perhaps best known for his often quoted characterization of Humboldt, who travelled in Cuba in the early 19th century, as the \\"second discoverer\\" of the island, after Columbus: \\"Col√≥n dio a Europa un Nuevo Mundo; Humboldt se lo hizo conocer en lo f√≠sico, en lo material, en lo intellectual y lo moral\\" (\\"Columbus gave Europe a New World; Humboldt made it known in its physical, material, intellectual, and moral aspects\\"). On November 29, 1831, de la Luz was visiting Venice, Italy, when he received a communication from Justo Yelez, director of the Seminario de San Carlos (San Carlos Seminary) in Havana, commissioning him to purchase the machines and devices required to study Physics at the school. De la Luz accepted the commission and performed a thorough investigation of the subject; when he had concluded his task, he recorded his observations in an extensive letter addressed to Yelez, and upon the latter's receipt of them they were included in the number 6 issue of the Revista Bimestre Cubana (Cuban Bimonthly Magazine). \\"Neither in France, nor in England, nor in Germany,\\" said de la Luz, \\"could have been found such a complete assortment of electro-magnetic devices, like that I acquired in Italy from the noble Italian gentleman from Modena.\\" On his return to Cuba in 1831, Luz devoted all his time and energies to the cause of education, assuming the directorship of a college from 1834 until 1839. In 1848 he founded the \\"El Salvador\\" school. Among his works are a translation of Volney's Travels in Egypt and Syria, with notes and additions (Paris, 1829); Siegling's Public Prisons and their Reforms, from the German (1837); and numerous memoirs and pamphlets on educational, scientific, and philosophical subjects.

State - 78% Special education In December 2010, Mountain View School District administration reported that 199 pupils or 16% of the district's pupils received Special education services. In December 2009, the district administration reported that 217 pupils or 18% of the district's pupils received special education services. The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. Mountain View School District received a $770,064 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 18 or 1.46% of its students were gifted in 2009, even though on average 10% of the population is gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum through a push in model with the gifted instructor in the classroom with the regular instructor. This approach permits such specialized instructional strategies as tiered assignments, curriculum compacting, flexible grouping, learning stations, independent projects and independent contracts. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to honors and advanced placement courses, and dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying policy The Mountain View School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti- bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2009, Mountain View School District reports employing over 110 teachers with a starting salary of $42,240 for 180 days for pupil instruction. The average teacher salary was $53,517 while the maximum salary is $103,000. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries. When adjusted for cost of living Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the nation for teacher compensation.Teachers need to know enough is enough, PaDelcoTimes, April 20, 2010. The teachers work 186 days per year and a 7-hour, 15-minute work day. Additionally, Mountain View School District teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, life insurance - $40,000, 100% employer-paid dental insurance, an income protection plan for disability, professional development reimbursement, 3 paid personal days, 10 sick days (which accumulate) and other benefits, including paid emergency leave and bereavement leave.

The retirement incentive includes that for each year of the ten contract years following an employee's retirement the District shall pay 50% of the retiree's health insurance premium. The Board agreed to give the Union 6 paid days to conduct union business. According to State Rep. Glen Grell, a trustee of the Pennsylvania Public School Employees‚Äô Retirement System Board, a 40-year educator can retire with a pension equal to 100 percent of their final salary. In 2007, the district employed 99 teachers. The average teacher salary in the district was $49,768 for 180 school days worked. Mountain View School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $546.30 per pupil. The district is ranked 400th out of 500 in Pennsylvania for administrative spending. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. In 2009, the Superintendent's salary was $105,060.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Public school Salaries Superintendent and IU Executives, 2009 In 2008, Mountain View School District reported spending $12,022 per pupil. This ranked 270th in the commonwealth. In 2010 the per pupil spending had increased to $13,362.21 Among the states, Pennsylvania's total per pupil revenue (including all sources) ranked 11th at $15,023 per student, in 2008-09. In 2007, the Pennsylvania per pupil total expenditures was $12,759. ; Reserves In 2009, the district reported $2,070,275 in an unreserved-undesignated fund balance. The designated fund balance was reported as zero. In 2010, Mountain View School District Administration reported $1,415,306 in the unreserved-undesignated fund balance and $821,677 in its designated fund. Pennsylvania school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In January 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. Findings were reported to the administration and school board. Mountain View School District is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax 0.5%, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax regardless of the individual's wealth. =State basic education funding= In 2011-12, the district received a $5,148,415 allocation, of state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the School District received $94,291 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget included $5,354,629,000 for the 2011-2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount is a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 2010-2011. The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011-12. In 2010, the district reported that 538 students received free or reduced-price lunches, due to the family meeting the federal poverty level.Pennsylvania Department of Education, District Allocations Report 2009, 2009-10 For 2010-11, the Mountain View School District received a 2% increase in state Basic Education Funding resulting in a $5,498,049 payment. Elk Lake School District received a 2.82% increase, which was the highest increase in BEF in Susquehanna County. Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County received the highest increase in the state at 23.65% increase in funding for the 2010-11 school year. One hundred fifty school districts received the base 2% increase in 2010-11. The amount of increase each school district receives is determined by then Governor Edward Rendell and the Secretary of Education, Gerald Zahorchak, through the allocation set in the state budget proposal made in February each year. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some districts at a far greater rate than others. In the 2009-2010 budget year the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 4.70% increase in Basic Education funding for a total of $5,390,244. The state Basic Education funding to the district in 2008-09 was $5,148,414.93. The district also received supplemental funding for English language learners, Title 1 federal funding for low-income students, for district size, a poverty supplement from the commonwealth and more. Montrose Area School District received a 4.88% increase, the highest increase in Susquehanna County for the 2009-10 school year. Among the 500 school districts in Pennsylvania, Muhlenberg School District in Berks County received the highest with a 22.31% increase in funding. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 530 district students received free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income in the 2007-2008 school year.Pennsylvania Department of Education Funding Report by LEA 2009. Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11 the Mountain View School District applied for and received $255,930 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district used the funding to provide full-day kindergarten for the 7th year and to reduce class size K-3rd grade. It also used the money for before and after school tutoring for students and for teacher training. Education Assistance grant The state's Education Assistance Program funding provides for the continuing support of tutoring services and other programs to address the academic needs of eligible students. Funds were available to eligible school districts and full-time career and technology centers (CTC) in which one or more schools have failed to meet at least one academic performance target, as provided for in Section 1512-C of the Pennsylvania Public School Code. In 2010-11 the Mountain View School District received $38,451. PreK Counts grant Mountain View School District receives state funding to provide preschool at the elementary school. For the 2011 school year, Pre-K Counts was funded at the 2010 levels of $83.6 million statewide in Gov. Tom Corbett's proposed budget,. The state also supplements the federal Head Start preschool program with an additional $37.6 million. Pre-K Counts funding was initiated during the Rendell administration. In 2007-08 the state funded Pre-K Counts at $75 million. Mountain View School District received funding in 2007-08. In 2009-10 the district received $150,676 to provide preschool to 20 children. For three years, Pennsylvania Pre-K Counts has documented the outcomes for children participating in the program through the Pelican state data collection system. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Mountain View School District did not apply for funding in 2006-07. In 2007-08 the district received $162,577. For the 2008‚Äì09, school year the district received $45,413 for a total of $207,990. Of the 501 public school districts in Pennsylvania, 447 of them received Classrooms for the Future grant awards. =Federal Stimulus grant= The district received an extra $1,815,808 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like Title 1, special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant School district officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district hundreds of thousands of additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. =Common Cents state initiative= The Mountain View School Board chose to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement any of the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= Mountain View School Board set property tax rates in 2011-12 at 34.3000 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections (Local Tax Enabling Act), which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. *2010-11 - 33.7000 mills. *2009-10 - 32.5000 mills *2008-09 - 32.5000 mills *2007-08 - 32.0000 mills. *2006-07 - 31.5000 mills. Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not authorized to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. The following exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011-12 school year, Mountain View School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. Mountain View School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budgets in 2009-10 or in 2010-11. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Mountain View School District was $214 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 2,449 property owners applied for the tax relief. The tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property on the individual's tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. The Pennsylvania Auditor General found that 48% of property owners applied for tax relief in Susquehanna County. In Susquehanna County, the highest property tax relief in 2009 was awarded to the approved property owners in Blue Ridge School District. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $632 per homestead and farmstead in 2010. This was the second year Chester Upland School District was the top recipient. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially more than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). Enrollment and consolidation Mountain View School District is experiencing low enrollment in K-12. The Pennsylvania Department of Education projects the district's enrollment will remain below 870 pupils through 2018.PDE Mountain View SD Enrollment and Projections. January 2009 Shifting population trends across the U.S. and Pennsylvania are affecting school enrollment and may impact the building needs of school districts in the years to come.Research Analyzes Rural School District Enrollment and Building Capacity Over the next 10 years, rural Pennsylvania school enrollment is projected to decrease 8 percent. The most significant enrollment decline is projected to be in western Pennsylvania, where rural school districts may have a 16 percent decline. More than 40 percent of elementary schools and more than 60 percent of secondary schools in western Pennsylvania are projected to experience significant enrollment decreases (15 percent or greater).\\"Research Analyzes Rural School District Enrollment and Building Capacity\\", The Center for Rural Pennsylvania. October 2009. A study done by Standard and Poors in 2007 (at the request of the PA General Assembly) examined the district consolidating with neighboring Blue Ridge School District. It found that residents in both districts would realize substantial savings in a consolidation. Savings of over $1000 per pupil were estimated. As a part of the study, Superintendents were asked about savings, if their district were to merge with another district at the administrative level only, without closing any of their schools. It found 42% of survey respondents thought consolidation could achieve cost reductions in their district. Additionally, 63% of responding superintendents believed that consolidation with another district would help provide additional academic enrichment opportunities for the students. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants Fiscal Responsibility Task Force released a report which found that consolidating school district administrations with one neighboring district would save the Commonwealth $1.2 billion without forcing the consolidation of any schools. Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. Less than 95 of Pennsylvania's 501 school districts have enrollment below 1250 students, in 2007.Pennsylvania Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, Study of the Cost Effectiveness of Consolidating Pennsylvania School Districts, 2007. Extracurriculars The Mountain View School District provides a wide variety of extracurricular programs, including clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility to participate is set by school board policies. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those home schooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.Home-Schooled, Charter School Children Can Participate in School District Extracurricular Activities, Pennsylvania Office of the Governor Press Release, November 10, 2005 =Sports = Mountain View School District has many sport teams for the students to participate in. The major sport is soccer. The boys varsity soccer team has made their way to states during the 2006-2008 seasons and the 2009-2012 seasons. The girls varsity soccer team won districts periodically. In the 2012-2013 school year, both varsity soccer teams won league titles, districts, and then went on to states. The boys team won the state championship in November 2012, which made them the first Lackawanna League team to win the PIAA State Championship. The boys team also made a return trip to Hershey in 2013. = Clubs = Mountain View has many clubs, including Student Government Association (SGA), Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), National Jr. and National Honor Society (NJHS and NHS respectively) as well as a snowriders club. Last year MVSGA (Mountain View Student Government Association) hosted the PASC District 9 Conference. Adult education The school district provides adult education programs to the region. Tuition is charged. District residents who attend 80% of the classes receive a full refund of tuition. The three courses offered in Spring 2011 cover: photography, canning and basic watercolor painting.

She was renowned for her spiritual counsel, devotion to the Blessed Sacrament, and fantastic miracles were attributed to her. She was beatified by the Catholic Church in 1625. Life = Early life = Columba was born Angelella Guardagnoli, the daughter of a poor family in the Umbrian city of Rieti. Legend states that when she was born, angels gathered around her house, singing, and that during her baptism, a dove flew down to the font. From then on, no one referred to her as Angelella, but as Columba (dove). As a small girl, Columba learned to spin and sew repairing the clothes of the local Dominican friars. She was educated by Dominican nuns. As a teenager, she prayed to discern her vocation in life and received a vision of Christ on a throne surrounded by saints. She took this as a sign to dedicate herself to God, and so she made a private vow of chastity, and spent her time in prayer. When it was revealed that her parents had arranged a marriage for her, she cut off her hair and sent it to her suitor as a way of letting him know where her real interest lay. = Eating disorder = Columba suffered from an eating disorder, a form of religiously-motivated self-starvation called anorexia mirabilis. Anorexia mirabilis was well known in Columba's time, when it was not seen as a medical emergency or mental illness as it would be today, instead revered as a symbol of one's piety. Ultimately, the disease caused her death in 1501, at the age of 34. Additionally, Columba was known to engage in acts designed to cause her physical pain, such as at the wearing of a hairshirt and sleeping on thorns. It's possible that she may have been influenced by Catherine of Siena, an earlier Italian Dominican saint, who suffered from anorexia mirabilis; she refused to eat to the point of starvation and died at the age of 33.Farmer, David Hugh (1997). The Oxford dictionary of saints (4. ed.). Oxford [u.a.]: Oxford Univ. Press. p. 93. . Also, like Catherine, Columba cut her hair short to avoid marriage. = Religious career = Columba became a Dominican tertiary at age 19. She was reputedly given to ecstasies, during one of which her spirit toured the Holy Land. She was much sought after as a spiritual counselor. It is said that citizens from the city of Narni tried to kidnap her so she could be their miracle worker, but she escaped. The same townsfolk were later to fight to retain their own townswoman and mystic, Lucy of Narni. Upon an interior prompting that she should leave Rieti, Columba wandered away, having no concept of where she was going. Along the way she was arrested in Foligno as a vagrant. The bishop there ordered her to go to Perugia and to found a Third Order convent, which she did, but only against the strong objections of the citizens of Foligno and Rieti who wanted her for their own towns. She worked with the poor extensively in Perugia, so much so that her sanctity reportedly incensed Lucrezia Borgia for years. At one point Borgia had even issued a complaint accusing Columba of practicing magic. On the other hand, Pope Alexander VI, Lucrezia's father, held Columba in high regard. He consulted her and received a severe admonition to repent from her. Columba spent eleven years as prioress in Perugia, dying on 2 May 1501, at the age of 34. Legend says that at the moment of her death, her friend and fellow Dominican tertiary, Osanna of Mantua, saw Columba's soul as a \\"radiance rising to heaven.\\" The whole city turned out for her funeral, which was paid for by the city fathers. She was beatified on 25 February 1625 by Pope Urban VIII, and her feast day is celebrated within the Dominican Order on the anniversary of her death.

He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Rush was a National League All-Star selection in and . Although he was a starting pitcher for the Cubs for ten seasons, and worked in 339 total games for them, he did not reach the postseason until he was a Milwaukee Brave, when he appeared in the 1958 World Series. Pitching career =Chicago Cubs= Born in Battle Creek, Michigan, Rush graduated from James Whitcomb Riley High School in South Bend, Indiana, and served in the United States Army during World War II. He was a combat veteran of the European theatre in Germany as a member of General George S. Patton's Third Army.Wolf, Gregory H., Bob Rush, Society for American Baseball Research Biography Project His pro career began in the Cub farm system in 1947. After only one year of minor-league seasoning, he joined the Cubs' MLB pitching staff. Pitching for a succession of poor teams, he lost 140 of the 250 decisions he earned as a Cub. Rush tied for the National League lead in games lost with 20 in 1950, his first All-Star season. Two years later, he had the best year of his career, winning 17 games (third most in the league) with a stellar 2.70 earned run average, fifth-best in the Senior Circuit. Selected to his second All-Star team that year, he appeared in the 1952 midsummer classic, played July 8 at Shibe Park. Rush worked two innings, entering the game in the fourth with the NL ahead, 1‚Äì0. He allowed the rival American League to forge ahead with two runs and three hits. But in the very next half-inning, his National League teammates, led by fellow Cub Hank Sauer, who homered, got those runs back to regain the lead, 3‚Äì2. Rush then held the Junior Circuit off the scoreboard in the fifth inning. With the game having gone the required 4 innings, the National League‚Äîand Rush‚Äîwere awarded a victory when the contest was ended by rain.Retrosheet box score (8 July 1952): \\"National League 3, American League 2 (5 innings)\\" In addition to his 17‚Äì13 record in 1952, Rush also posted back- to-back over-.500 seasons in (13‚Äì11) and (13‚Äì10); his earned run averages of 3.50 and 3.19 during those seasons were ninth and seventh, respectively, in the National League. =Milwaukee Braves= Rush was traded to the defending world champion Braves in a five-player deal in December 1957. He then worked in 28 games, starting 20, and posted five complete games and two shutouts during the Braves' successful defense of their league pennant. He was Milwaukee's starting pitcher for Game 3 of the 1958 World Series at Yankee Stadium, with the Braves ahead in the Series, two games to none. Rush gave the Braves six strong innings, allowing the New York Yankees only three hits. But control problems proved costly when Rush's three walks loaded the bases for Hank Bauer's two-run single.Retrosheet box score (4 October 1957): \\"New York Yankees 4, Milwaukee Braves 0\\" 1958 World Series Game 3 Those were all the runs Yankee starter Don Larsen needed in a 4‚Äì0 win. While the Braves captured Game 4 to build a three-games-to-one advantage, New York won Games 5 through 7 to take the world title away from Milwaukee. Rush was primarily a relief pitcher for the Braves, making nine spot starts among his 30 appearances during the 154-game schedule and posting five victories and an effective 2.42 earned run average. The Braves found themselves embroiled in a three-way pennant fight with the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants that went down to the season's final weekend. When it ended, the Braves and Dodgers, both with 86‚Äì68 records, were deadlocked for the National League pennant, and a best-of-three tie-breaker series was necessary to determine a champion. The Dodgers won Game 1 at Milwaukee, putting the Braves' backs against the wall. In Game 2, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on September 29, the Braves squandered a 5‚Äì2 lead when the Dodgers rallied for three runs in the bottom of the ninth inning, tying the score and sending the contest into extra innings. In the 11th frame, Rush was called into the game with the Braves in dire straights: the Dodgers had the bases loaded, with two out. But he retired Charlie Neal on a ground ball to secure the third out and preserve the tie. In the 12th inning, Milwaukee did not score in its half and Rush returned to the mound. He retired the first two Los Angeles hitters, Wally Moon and Stan Williams, but then his fortunes changed. Gil Hodges walked and was singled to second base by Joe Pignatano. Veteran Carl Furillo then made an infield hit to shortstop, and when F√©lix Mantilla threw wildly to first base, Hodges scored the pennant-deciding run on the error. Rush gave up no earned runs, but was charged with the loss.Retrosheet box score (29 September 1959): \\"Los Angeles Dodgers 6, Milwaukee Braves 5 (12 innings)\\" =Career statistics and trivia= Rush split between the Braves and the American League White Sox, getting into 19 total games as a relief pitcher. He earned his final two MLB victories and a save for Milwaukee before being sent to the White Sox on June 11. He was given his unconditional release in November, ending his pitching career. All told, Rush compiled a 127‚Äì152 won‚Äìlost record in MLB, with a 3.65 earned run average, 118 complete games and 16 shutouts. He earned eight saves coming out of the bullpen. In 2,410 innings pitched, he allowed 2,327 hits and 789 bases on balls. He struck out 1,244. On June 11, 1950, Rush and pitcher Warren Spahn of the Boston Braves each stole a base against each other; no opposing pitchers again stole a base in the same game until May 3, 2004, when Jason Marquis and Greg Maddux repeated the feat.Camps, Mark, \\"Rare feet: Opposing hurlers steal bases in the same game,\\" The San Francisco Chronicle, 5/9/04, accessed 8/20/09 Late in the 1957 season, while Rush was warming up in the Wrigley Field bullpen during a game, a wild pitch he threw went into the stands and injured a spectator, who sued him and the Cubs, one of the few times in Major League Baseball history when a player has been named as a defendant by a fan injured by an object that left the field. The court granted Rush summary judgement which was affirmed on appeal a decade later; however it held that the Baseball Rule, which generally immunizes teams against suits by fans injured by foul balls who sit in seats outside the backstop's protection, did not extend to an errantly thrown ball and that a jury could decide if the Cubs had adequately anticipated the risk of one leaving the field and striking a fan. Bob Rush died in Mesa, Arizona, the Cubs' longtime spring training home, at age 85.

The order was awarded until the constitutional role of the Bey was abolished following 1957. Background information The order essentially existed in two different models: the first awarded from its creation in 1835 and the second following 1859. Initially awarded in a single class, the order was reorganized and awarded in five classes following 1843 and expanded to six classes in 1882: :# 60px Grand Cordon :# 60px Grand-officer :# 60px Commander :# 60px Officer :# 60px Knight of 1st class :# 60px Knight of 2nd class This order could be awarded to people of French nationality, cities (like Verdun), and other notable foreigners with some connection to Tunisia. It was given by the bey of Tunis on a proposal from the chief vizier for Tunisian subjects and, in all the other cases, on a proposal from the resident general of France (which occupies de facto the post of Foreign Minister of Tunisia). Although the resident general has a quota, this last remains about it always the large Master. Each bey having put his monogram on the center of the decoration, it is possible to determine the approximate award date of each order. Examples of the decoration The typical decoration is manufactured from solid silver with green and red enameled rays for some classes. The reverse of the decoration as well as the bow and suspension ring may have jeweler, date, and acceptance markings. These particular decorations (second model) were awarded by Ali Muddat ibn al-Husayn Bey (1882‚Äì1902). Image:JMA-fav.jpg  JM Abdul Aziz seen wears the Commander around his neck.

Later, they were naturalized by the Egyptian government as citizens. Farid's mother sang and played the Oud, which spurred his musical interest at an early age. As a child and young adult, al-Atrash sang within school events. He studied at Egypt's music conservatory and became an apprentice of the renowned Egyptian composer Riad Al Sunbati. In the 1930s, al-Atrash began his professional singing career by working for privately owned Egyptian radio stations. Eventually, he was hired as an oud player for the national radio station and later as a singer. His sister, Asmahan, was also a talented singer, and for a while they worked together. In 1941, they starred in their first successful movie Intisar a l-Shabab (ÿßŸÜÿ™ÿµÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿ®ÿßÿ® ‚Äì The Triumph of Youth, 1941), in which Farid himself composed all the music.Mustafa Darwish Dream makers on the Nile: a portrait of Egyptian cinema 1998 yes it was true Family Camilla Al Atrash, the only daughter of Asmahan with her uncle Farid {{quoteHis younger sister, Asmahan, evidenced similar musical talent in her teens, becoming one of the most popular female vocalists and cinema stars in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Farid is better known than Asmahan because her career was interrupted by her death in an accident in 1944. Yet he was initially overshadowed by his sister's talent and popularity. With maturity and the forging of a successful performance formula, Farid became famous in his own right. Even today, the reference to the given name \\"Farid\\" in the context of Arabic music or popular culture is immediately understood to denote al-Atrash himself. Musical career Al-Atrash had a long and colorful music career lasting four decades. He composed musically diverse songs, and was a highly regarded composer, singer and instrumentalist. Al-Atrash maintained that although some of his music had western musical influence, he always stayed true to Arab music principles. Although the majority of his compositions were romantic love songs, he also composed several patriotic and religious songs. One of al-Atrash's most unusual and distinguishable traits was his voice. High and mellow at the start of his career, it evolved into a wider, deeper sound. A person not familiar with his work would find it hard to believe the singer in \\"Ya Reitni Tir\\" (1930s) and \\"Adnaytani Bil Hajr\\" (1960s) were the same singer. His singing style was deeply passionate. In many of his songs, and nearly all of his concerts, al- Atrash would sing a mawal, which is a local folk Egyptian slow voice improvisation of a few poetic lines. These improvisations sometimes lasted up to 15 minutes. The mawal was a favorite of his fans. Some of the most famous songs include \\"Rabeeh\\" (Spring), \\"Awal Hamsa\\" (first whisper), \\"Hekayat Gharami\\" (story of my love), \\"Albi Wa Moftaho\\" (my heart and its key), \\"Gamil Gamal\\", \\"Wayak\\", \\"Ya Zahratan Fi Khayali\\" (Ÿäÿß ÿ≤Ÿáÿ±ÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿÆŸäÿßŸÑŸä ‚Äì \\"Flower of my imagination), \\"Bisat Ir Rih\\" (flying carpet), \\"Ya Gamil Ya Gamil\\", \\"Ya Habaybi Ya Ghaybeen\\", \\"Eish Anta\\", and \\"sa3a bi 2orb el habib\\" (an hour in company of the beloved). Film career Al-Atrash starred in 31 Egyptian musical films from 1941 to 1974. His last movie, Nagham Fi Hayati (ŸÜÿ∫ŸÖ ŸÅŸä ÿ≠Ÿäÿßÿ™Ÿä, Songs in my life) was released after his death. All his films except the last two were black and white. They ranged from comedies to dramas, or a combination. He composed all the songs in his movies including the songs sung by other singers, and instrumentals (usually belly dance routines). His earlier films would include approximately ten songs, but overall the films would average about five songs each. Some of al-Atrash's well-known movies include Intisar al-Shabab (ÿßŸÜÿ™ÿµÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿ®ÿßÿ® ‚Äì The Triumph of Youth, 1941), Yom Bila Ghad, Ahd el- Hawa, and Lahn al-Kholoud (ŸÑÿ≠ŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿÆŸÑŸàÿØ ‚Äì \\"Eternal Tune\\", 1952). Personal life Al-Atrash shaking hands with Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, February 1955 Quick success brought the young man a lifestyle of nightclubs, love affairs, and gambling. Soon Farid was in debt and found himself abandoned by his disapproving mother. During this difficult period of his life, he also endured the death of his sister and fellow performer Asmahan. Farid found comfort in a relationship with the belly-dancer Samia Gamal, for whom he was motivated to risk all he owned. In 1947 he produced and co-starred in a movie with Samia directed by Henri Barakat; Habib al-'Oumr (\\"The love of my life,\\" 1947), which became a huge success. After this came Afrita Hanem (\\"Madame la diablesse,\\" 1949). Five films later, the unmarried couple broke up. Farid continued to work with other film stars in numerous successful movies in which he always had the romantic lead role of a sad singer. He even repeatedly chose his character's name to be \\"Wahid,\\" meaning lonely. Al-Atrash refused to get married, claiming that marriage kills art. In his films, the audience remembered his leading ladies and his beautiful songs more than the story lines.https://www.aljadid.com/content/remembering-farid-al-atrash-contender- age-giants Prior to the 1952 military coup d'√©tat against King Farouk I, al- Atrash became friends with Farouk's consort, Queen Nariman, a relationship that continued after the Queen's divorce and the coup that cost Farouk his throne.https://www.traditionalarabicmusic.com/Contemporary%20Notables/Fareed%20alatrach.htm The former queen's family did not accept al-Atrash, and the separation from Nariman sent the singer into a long depression, the start of health problems that worsened from that point on until his death. As al-Atrash became older, he reconsidered his opinion of marriage and proposed to Egyptian singer named Shadia, but at the last minute he backed out. By now his health was poor, and he feared that he would leave her a young widow. He often played out that scenario and sang about it in his romance movies. He was also engaged to marry Salwa al-Qudsi at the end of his life.Zuhur, field notes, 1993 Others stated: \\"He remained a bachelor throughout his life\\" but he possibly had a brief 'urfi marriage.Turshan family members in interview with Sherifa Zuhur, 1993 from field notes. and another Moroccan-born singer Maya Casabianca called him the \\"love of her life\\" (though they didn't marry). \\"Famed Moroccan-born Jewish Singer and Farid Al Atrash‚Äôs lover Maya Casabianca\\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMtgZYuOBlo He characterized himself in a fairly idealized version of a modern artist. \\"Tales of his love affairs were wildly popular during his lifetime and were seemingly merged with the lyrics of his love songs.\\" (Zuhur in Ouzgane 2003) Death Al-Atrash suffered from heart problems throughout his last 30 years. In the last few years of his life, he became physically thinner, and his singing voice became raspy as he is intensified. Although he was struggling with his health, he continued to produce movies and perform in concerts until he died. On Monday December 24, 1974 the doctors told al-Atrash that after two days he could go home. This was because they noticed that Farid did not like the hospital, or the drugs and the food that the hospital provided for him. On December 26, 1974, al-Atrash died in Beirut, Lebanon at Al Hayek hospital, shortly after arriving from London. Al-Atrash is buried in Cairo, Egypt alongside his sister and brother.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu7G5GWzglk Legacy Over his lifetime, al-Atrash starred in 31 movies and recorded approximately 350 songs. He composed songs for top Arab singers, foremost his own sister, Asmahan, as well as Wadih El-Safi, Shadia, Warda, and Sabah. He is widely considered to be one of the four 'greats' of Egyptian and Arabic music, along with Abdel Halim Hafez, Mohammed Abdel Wahab and Oum Kalthoum. Notable Egyptian instrumental guitarist Omar Khorshid covered Farid al-Atrash's songs in a tribute album. On October 19, 2020, Google celebrated his 110th birthday with a Google Doodle.

This game is also referred to as Bullshit Pyramid. Set up One begins by creating a pyramid of cards by placing them face down on the table in rows (6 cards on the bottom row, 5 on the next, then 4, 3, 2, and 1 card peak on the top row). Next, the dealer passes out three cards to each player, face down. Players can look at their cards only once and should not let other players see them. Object The object of the game is to make other players drink based on what cards that they think you have. Game play *Turn over the bottom, left card. *If a player wishes, he/she may tell another player to drink a sip if he/she has a card with the same face value in his/her hand and places it on the card that is flipped over. * Alternatively, the player may \\"bluff\\" and pretend to have the card in question. The player told to drink can either take the designated drink(s) or call the bluff. If a player's bluff is called, that player must drink double the designated drinks. If the player was not bluffing, the player originally told to drink now has to drink double the designated drinks. A player who is forced to show his/her cards is entitled to exchange the used card for a new card from the deck. *Turn over the next card in the row. *After the bottom row is all flipped, continue on the next row. *The number of drinks corresponds to the row in which that card was flipped. For example, if the card is in the third row, one must play with three drinks). *To add more action to the game, players may be asked to lie their cards face down and remember them. If someone says the player is bluffing, the player has to find his card - taking out the wrong card results in a penalty where the player must drink twice the amount he would otherwise have dealt. Finally, when the pyramid is over, players take turns in memorizing their deck, in the right order. For every card they get wrong, an agreed penalty is dealt.

The park is bounded by streets of the same name on its northern, eastern, southern, and western borders, and is adjacent to the Crotona Park East and Morrisania neighborhoods of the Bronx. It is divided into four portions by Claremont Parkway and Crotona Avenue, which run through it. Crotona Park formerly belonged to the Bathgate family, a prominent landowning family in the South Bronx. It was created through the New Parks Act in 1888 as part of a boroughwide network of parks connected by parkways. The Crotona Play Center was added in 1936. Crotona Park was formerly , but the northern portion was cut off by the Cross Bronx Expressway in 1945, becoming what is now known as Tremont Park. After a period of deterioration in the late 20th century, several improvement projects were commenced starting in the 1990s. Crotona Park includes a lake, as well as numerous recreational facilities such as a swimming pool. The Crotona Play Center, a national and city-designated landmark, is in the western part of the park. The park is operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, also known as NYC Parks. History =Early history= In the 1870s, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted envisioned a greenbelt across the Bronx, consisting of parks and parkways that would align more with existing geography. This contrasted with Manhattan's grid system, laid out during the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, which had given rise to Central Park, a park with mostly artificial features within the bounds of the grid. However, in 1877, the city declined to act upon his plan. Around the same time, New York Herald editor John Mullaly pushed for the creation of parks in New York City, particularly lauding the Van Cortlandt and Pell families' properties in the western and eastern Bronx respectively. He formed the New York Park Association in November 1881. There were objections to the system, which would apparently be too far from Manhattan, in addition to precluding development on the parks' sites. However, newspapers and prominent lobbyists, who supported such a park system, were able to petition the bill into the New York State Senate, and later, the New York State Assembly (the legislature's lower house). In June 1884, Governor Grover Cleveland signed the New Parks Act into law, authorizing the creation of the park system. Acquired in 1888 as a result of the New Parks Act, Crotona Park is located on part of the former estate of the Bathgate family, which owned large plots of land in the South Bronx. Alexander Bathgate, a Scottish immigrant, had acquired the land from his employer Gouverneur Morris. At the time, the land comprising present-day Crotona Park was called Bathgate Woods, which was located on a high point and contained woods and a pond called Indian Lake. The Bathgate family opened the area near Indian Lake to the public, and it became a picnicking spot. The Bronx Department of Parks, in its 1884 report to the state legislature, noted the land as having \\"indispensable requisites for a park\\", such as a \\"luxuriant growth of forest\\" with native oaks, elms, and magnolias, as well as proximity to railroad lines such as the Third Avenue elevated and the Harlem Line. Due to rapid urbanization, Bathgate Farm quickly became one of the few remaining greenspaces in the Bronx. When the Bronx Department of Parks acquired the parkland, it originally planned to name the now-public parkland Bathgate Park. Due to one park engineer's disagreements with the Bathgate family, it was named \\"Crotona\\", after the ancient Greek city of Crotone, and to distinguish it from the nearby, similarly-named Croton Aqueduct water system. The northernmost section of Crotona Park was known as Old Borough Hall Park due to the presence of Bronx Borough Hall in the park. The park did not receive many improvements until the 20th century. Indian Lake's perimeter was paved in the early 1900s, and an ice-skaters' concession stand and a warming hut were installed. In addition, landscaping work was performed, and a new grandstand for concerts and ball games was erected. Three hundred American elms were planted around the lake in 1903. Two years later, an athletic field for the New York City Department of Education was built. A bill was introduced in the Assembly in 1909, which would install a New York National Guard armory in Crotona Park. The bill was heavily denounced by the public, and though both the Assembly and Senate passed the bill, mayor George B. McClellan Jr. vetoed it. Crotona Park was expanded via land acquisition in 1907 and 1911, and extra tennis courts were added in 1915. A concrete wall around the lake's perimeter, as well as lamps and paths, were installed in 1914. A \\"farm garden\\", to teach children about farming, was added in 1928. By 1911, local landowners complained that the sporting events at the athletic field and bandstand were too loud. They requested that the field be moved further within Crotona Park. In 1916, several local landowners filed a lawsuit, calling the athletic field and bandstand \\"nuisances\\" that were not conducive to park operation. Some of these landowners alleged that they could not sell their property. =Works Progress Administration renovation = A promotional photograph of the pool at Crotona Park, from 1964 In 1934, Robert Moses was nominated by mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia to become commissioner of a unified New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. At the time, the United States was experiencing the Great Depression, and immediately after La Guardia won the 1934 election, Moses began to write \\"a plan for putting 80,000 men to work on 1,700 relief projects\\". By the time he was in office, several hundred projects were underway across the city. Moses was especially interested in creating new pools and other bathing facilities, such as those in Jacob Riis Park, Jones Beach, and Orchard Beach. He devised a list of pools at 11 locations around the city, including at Crotona Park, which would be built using funds from the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a federal agency created to combat the Depression's negative effects as part of the New Deal. In total, Moses planned to create 23 pools. He, along with architects Aymar Embury II and Gilmore David Clarke, created a common design for each of the 11 proposed aquatic centers. Each location was to have distinct pools for diving, swimming, and wading; bleachers and viewing areas; and bathhouses with locker rooms that could be used as gymnasiums. The pools were to have several common features, such as a minimum length, underwater lighting, heating, filtration, and low-cost construction materials. To fit the requirement for cheap materials, each building would be built using elements of the Streamline Moderne and Classical architectural styles. The buildings would also be located near \\"comfort stations\\", additional playgrounds, and spruced-up landscapes. Plans for the construction of ten tennis courts, a new playground, and additional handball courts and baseball diamonds at Crotona Park were announced in May 1934. Construction for some of the 11 pools began that October. Of these, Crotona Park was the only location in the Bronx where a WPA pool would be constructed. A wading pool had opened to the north of the future bathhouse site by mid-1935. The blueprints for the Crotona Park pool and bathhouse were submitted to the New York City Department of Buildings that August. By mid-1936, ten of the eleven WPA-funded pools were completed and were being opened at a rate of one per week. Crotona Pool opened on July 25, 1936, in front of a crowd of five thousand; according to The New York Times, about 10,000 would-be participants had to be refused entry. The center was composed of the main swimming pool, a bathhouse, and the wading pool to the north of the bathhouse. In 1938, further improvements were announced for the 11 locations that had received new pools. About $2.87 million (equal to around $ million in ) was allocated to the renovation of Crotona Park, including the sidewalks on the surrounding streets. NYC Parks started rebuilding the baseball and softball fields and the existing athletic field. Sometime in the 1940s, a brick boathouse was built along the lake to replace a previous wooden structure that had burned down. In 1941, NYC Parks announced the completion of these improvements. In total, seven playgrounds were added, three others were rebuilt, and a children's farm and two comfort stations were constructed. In total, between 1934 and the 1960s, NYC Parks added the pool and bathhouse, as well as five baseball fields, nine playgrounds, twenty tennis courts, four comfort stations, paths, and sitting areas. = Decline = An entrance to the park At its peak, Crotona Park encompassed of land. When the Cross Bronx Expressway was built in 1945, the northernmost portion of Crotona Park was cut off from the rest of the park. The northernmost section was still known as Crotona Park until 1987, when it was renamed Highland Park; the northern section has been known as Tremont Park since 1999. By the 1950s, Crotona Park had become the setting for several high-profile crimes, as gangs began to develop in the surrounding neighborhoods. Incidents included a thwarted battle between dozens of teenage gang members in 1950; a series of muggings at the park in 1954; the beating of a teacher in 1958; and the fatal stabbing of a teenager in 1965. Additionally, in July 1960, a six-year-old boy drowned in the Crotona Play Center's swimming pool. To deter crime, and especially in response to a murder in a poorly lit playground in Manhattan, Robert F. Wagner Jr. proposed replacing the lighting in Crotona Park and other city parks. The project was completed by 1963. Restoration work in the Crotona Play Center was announced in 1965 as part of Wagner's plan to restore parks, playgrounds, and libraries around the city. Ultimately, these improvements did not occur, and many benches and water fountains were damaged without being replaced. The boathouse stopped offering boat tours in 1970. In early 1971, vandals stole multiple electric and plumbing fixtures from the play center, causing tens of thousands of dollars in damage. To deter future crimes of similar magnitude, the bath house's and filter house's windows were filled in. Nevertheless, the play center remained popular. In 1973, to determine the feasibility of completely renovating Crotona Park, the city performed a \\"blitz cleanup\\" with maintenance crews from all five boroughs. According to one official, such a cleanup had not been performed previously because NYC Parks officials were scared of being attacked by area teenagers. Around this time, surrounding portions of the South Bronx were being decimated by fire and crime. One particularly egregious example was Charlotte Street, located directly southeast of Crotona Park, which by the late 1970s saw the demolition of almost every building along its three-block length. = Restoration to present day = By the 1970s, Crotona Park and other city parks were in poor condition due to the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis. NYC Parks commenced a project to restore the pools in several parks in 1977, including at Crotona Park, for whose restoration the agency set aside an estimated $5.8 million. These projects were not carried out due to a lack of money, and by March 1981, NYC Parks only had 2,900 employees in its total staff, less than 10 percent of the 30,000 present when Moses was parks commissioner. In 1982, the NYC Parks budget increased greatly, enabling the agency to carry out $76 million worth of restoration projects by year's end; among these projects was the restoration of the Crotona Park pool. Work had begun by early 1983, and the complex was closed for two summer seasons while construction was ongoing. The play center reopened on August 2, 1984. During this era, other improvements were made to the park, including the restoration of the lake and boathouse, replacement of benches, and repaving of paths. In 1983, a volunteer ranger program was created to help maintain Crotona Park and other city parks. Some $500,000 in funding was provided by the federal government toward the rangers program. The nature rangers moved into the old boathouse in 1984, but a few years later, abandoned it after their funds had been depleted. In addition, three U.S. presidential candidates, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton, visited the park, while Pope John Paul II said mass there in 1979. This helped draw attention to Crotona Park as one of the only large green spaces in the South Bronx. NYC Parks continued to face financial shortfalls in the coming years, and the pools retained a reputation for being unsafe. Crotona Park as a whole was also seen as an unsafe area. Violent crimes including the stabbing of a pregnant woman, a shootout that injured a child, and a man who was set on fire during a bike theft were all reported in the 1980s and early 1990s; in addition, a serial rapist reportedly frequented the park. For the summer of 1991, mayor David Dinkins had planned to close all 32 outdoor pools in the city, a decision that was only reversed after a $2 million donation from real estate developer Sol Goldman and $1.8 million from other sources. Additionally, in the 1990s, a practice called \\"whirlpooling\\" became common in New York City pools such as Crotona Park, wherein women would be inappropriately fondled by teenage boys. By the turn of the century, crimes such as sexual assaults had decreased in parks citywide due to increased security. By the 1990s, there was a movement to revitalize Crotona Park, led by figures such as Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, who headed the Central Park Conservancy's effort to revive Central Park in the preceding years. In 1996, an organization called the Friends of Crotona Park was established. The two pools adjacent to the main pool were both infilled in the late 20th century. The diving pool was infilled in 1995 while the rectangular wading pool was modified into a hexagonal shape after the 1980s before being filled in by 1996. In 1999, the Lila Wallace Readers Digest Fund allocated $1.1 million to the restoration of five city parks including Crotona Park, to be matched by funds from the city. The park's nature center was reopened in May 2001, at which point a \\"restoration and management plan\\" was created for the park, which envisioned Crotona Park as a greenspace linking the surrounding communities. In 2009, the lake was restored and a new performance amphitheater was opened. A rehabilitation of the nature center was approved in 2014, and the Cary Leeds Center for Tennis & Learning opened near Indian Lake in 2015, with a new two-story clubhouse and twenty restored tennis courts. NYC Parks also released a master plan for Crotona and Tremont Parks in June 2015. The plan calls for the construction of a cafe, dog run, and skate park in Crotona Park, as well as the construction of connections between the parks. The boathouse was restored in 2016.  Attractions and facilities  Crotona Park is bounded by Crotona Park West (also known as Fulton Avenue), Crotona Park North, Crotona Park East, and Crotona Park South (a continuation of St. Paul's Place). It is divided into four sections of unequal size by Claremont Parkway and Crotona Avenue. The park serves the neighborhoods of Claremont to the west, Belmont and Tremont to the north, West Farms to the northeast, Crotona Park East to the southeast, and Morrisania to the southwest. Due to its central location between several different neighborhoods, Crotona Park is sometimes known as the \\"Central Park of the South Bronx\\". Crotona Park also contains connections to Hylan Park and Crotona Parkway at the northeast corner and Tremont Park near the northwest corner, though connections to all three are poor. Crotona Park contains 28 species of trees, as well as the Crotona Pool, the largest in the Bronx. A series of asphalt paths crosses the park, connecting its different features. = Recreational facilities =  Playgrounds  Crotona Park contains twelve playgrounds: * Bathgate Playground, located at the intersection of Fulton Avenue and 173rd Street, in the park's northwest section. It is named for the Bathgate family. * Boxcar Playground, located at the intersection of Crotona Park East and Charlotte Street, in the park's eastern section. * Carter Playground, located at the intersection of Crotona Park East and Charlotte Street, in the park's eastern section. Originally named Playground #7, it was named for U.S. president Jimmy Carter in 1998. * Clinton Playground, located on Crotona Park South between Clinton and Prospect Avenues, in the park's southwest section. It is named for governor DeWitt Clinton. * Hill & Dale Playground, located at the intersection of Crotona Park East and 173rd Street, in the park's eastern section. * Martin Van Buren Playground, located on Crotona Park East between Prospect Avenue and Claremont Parkway, in the park's southeast section. It is named for U.S. president Martin Van Buren. * Playground of the Stars, located at Fulton Avenue between St. Pauls Place and 171st Street, in the park's southwest section. It is named after four constellations engraved near the park's spray fountain: Cetus, Cygnus, Ursa Major, and Canis Major. * Playground 1, located at the intersection of Crotona Park North and Crotona Avenue. * Playground 3, located at Crotona Park North between Marmion Avenue and Waterloo Place, in the park's northeast section. * Playground 4, located at Crotona Park East between Waterloo Place and 173rd Street, in the park's northeast section. * Playground 11, located at Fulton Avenue between Claremont Parkway and 172nd Street, in the park's northwest section. * Prospect Park, located at Crotona Park North between Prospect and Marmion Avenues, in the park's northeast section.  Recreation fields  One of the play areas at Crotona Park Crotona Park includes several sporting fields. Within the namesake recreation center, there is an indoor basketball court, a gymnasium, and a community center. Outdoors, there are numerous basketball courts, handball courts, soccer fields, and baseball fields scattered throughout the park. The southern shore of Crotona Park's pond contains a baseball field, two basketball courts, and four handball courts. The northeast corner of the park contains another two basketball courts, eight handball courts, and a soccer field. The northern shore of the pond contains two baseball fields and a basketball court, as well as the Cary Leeds Center for Tennis and Learning, with twenty tennis courts. Across Claremont Avenue to the west is the Crotona Play Center, where there are two baseball fields (one to the north and the other to the south), as well as a basketball court and two handball courts to the south. There is yet another basketball court at the northwest corner of Crotona Park South and Claremont Parkway, and a baseball field at the northeast corner of the same intersection. In total, there are six baseball fields, seven basketball courts, one soccer field, twenty tennis courts, and fourteen handball courts. The outdoor fields are free for use by the general public, but some indoor activities require a membership.  Hylan Park  Hylan Park is a sitting area at the northeast corner of Crotona Park. Named after mayor John Francis Hylan, it is bounded by 175th Street to the north, Southern Boulevard to the east, Crotona Park East to the south and southwest, and Waterloo Place to the west.  Tremont Park  Tremont Park's grand staircase, seen from Third Avenue Tremont Park is a park just north of Crotona Park's northwestern section, separated from it by the Cross Bronx Expressway. It is named after the neighborhood of Tremont, and was also previously called Highland Park and Old Borough Hall Park; before that, it was part of Crotona Park. The park is bounded by Tremont Avenue to the north, Arthur Avenue to the east, 175th Street to the south, and Third Avenue to the west. The park's most significant features are the steps to the former Bronx Borough Hall site and the circular paths around a former fountain site. Tremont Park was renovated in 1995 and includes basketball courts, a baseball field, playgrounds, showers, and chess tables. = Geographical features = Crotona Park is located on a high point in the Bronx. According to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, on clear days, one can see the Hudson River Palisades to the west and the Brooklyn Bridge to the south from certain points in the park.  Lake and nature center  An early photo of Indian Lake Crotona Park contains a pond called Indian Lake. According to NYC Parks, the name supposedly comes from 19th-century youths who lived in the area and \\"envisioned Weckguasgeeck Indians sitting around the lake on the ledge of the rock surrounding their chief, who would be smoking the legendary peace pipe with newly-arrived Europeans seeking land to settle\\". The pond is also popularly called Crotona Lake. Historically, Indian Lake drained into Bungay or Bound Brook, which then flowed south to the East River near what is now Hunts Point. An amphitheater is located at the southern shore of the lake, adjacent to a stone bridge that spans an inlet at the lake's extreme south end. The lake is inhabited by ducks, turtles, and fish. The surrounding area contains numerous native floral species including tulip, black cherry, hickory, sassafras, and sweetgum. As of the 2015 master plan, the lake had become overgrown with algal blooms and contained excessive litter due to its proximity to picnic areas. Adjoining the lake's eastern shore is a nature center, a brick structure that opened in 2001 and formerly served as a boathouse. The boathouse was built in either 1928 or the 1940s, replacing a wooden structure erected in the early 20th century. The nature center sponsors outdoor activities such as nature walks, species identification, and summer camps. = Crotona Play Center= Crotona Play Center, located in Crotona Park's northwestern quadrant, is the only swimming pool complex built by the Works Progress Administration in the Bronx. Its main entrance is accessed from Fulton Avenue and 173rd Street, which provides access to the bathhouse and pool deck. The play center covers and includes a bathhouse that separates the main pool and the former wading pool. The interior of the bathhouse contains mirror-image locker rooms.Guide To New York City Landmarks, John Wiley and Sons, 2007, p. 327. The complex was designed by Embury and Clarke with Herbert D. Magoon, whose plan combines Art Moderne and Modern Classical elements. The primary buildings are decorated with sculptures by Frederick Roth, including ibis-topped pilasters on the bathhouse and bas-reliefs in the sitting niches which are adjacent to the pool. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs On June 26, 2007, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the interior and exterior of the Crotona Play Center as official city landmarks. Additionally, the play center was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 28, 2015.  Bathhouse  The main entrance contains a stair, spanned by a very large arched brick gateway overlooked by towers with glass-block skylights. Along the arch are bronze letters spelling . A cornerstone at the base of the north tower reads . The stairway contains brick sidewalls. At the top of the stair is a brick courtyard which is enclosed by a two-story structure with a second story balcony. In the entrance foyer just east of the courtyard, there were booths that sold tickets for the bathhouse; the ticket booths are now closed since the bathhouse is free to use. An overpass projects from the southern facade of the courtyard building, connecting to a brick first-aid station. To the east of the courtyard is a rectangular building with two nearly-identical pavilions to the north and south. The longer side is located on a west-east axis (i.e. parallel to 173rd Street), while the shorter side is located on a north-south axis (i.e. parallel to Fulton Avenue). The building contains a brick facade with semicircular-patterned and cast stone details. The northern pavilion houses the men's locker room while the southern pavilion houses the women's locker room. The western facades of both pavilions contain brick-arched window openings at ground level; the north pavilion has a balconet on the second floor, though the south pavilion has a full-height opening. The northern and southern facades each contain seven bays. Each bay contains arched windows on the first floor, and a pair of half-story skylights where the second floor would be; the second-story skylights are recessed slightly inward within the building. The eastern facade forms the back of the building, facing the pool area. The eastern facade is subdivided into six bays. Inside, the roofs of each locker room are supported by arched concrete buttresses that run between the rooms' northern and southern walls. The lowest of each wall is tiled while the rest of the wall is plastered. The locker rooms each contain lockers on their northern and southern walls. Otherwise they are nearly identical except for differing placements of several window openings. During the fall through spring, these locker rooms are used as gymnasium facilities. To the east of the locker rooms are toilets and showers for each gender. These facilities were arranged so that both the men's and women's shower rooms contained an exit to the southern facade at the extreme eastern end of the building. The northern facade of the bathhouse's eastern end also contains entrances to a girls' bathroom, a mothers' room, and a director's office. The southern facade of that part of the building includes a boy's bathroom, adjacent to the entrance to the men's shower room.  Pool  The complex contains a rectangular main pool and formerly also consisted of smaller diving and wading pools. The main pool is located to the south of the bathhouse and measures . To the south of the main pool was a semicircular diving pool, which since 2014 contains spray fountains. A ramp, underneath the overpass between the brick first-aid house and the Play Center's courthouse, provides entrance to the pool from Fulton Avenue to the west. Concrete bleachers are located along the western border of the pool area, adjoining a retaining wall that separates the pool area from Fulton Avenue, and extend southward along the round edge of the diving pool area. The eastern side of the pool area contains twelve niches with benches, set into the retaining wall on that side. A single-story filter house sits to the east of the main pool area, south of the benches. The former wading pool area, now part of Bathgate Playground, is located north of the bathhouse. It is surrounded by a retaining wall. The pool area, once semicircular before being converted into a hexagonal shape in the 1980s, was filled in by 1996. The site contains playground equipment such as swings and benches. Notable events left From 1996 to 2012, the park hosted the EmblemHealth Bronx Open, an International Tennis Federation women's tennis tournament with a $100,000 purse which featured players in the top 100, who used the tournament as a \\"tune-up\\" for the US Open which begins the following week. The Bronx Open also hosted the United States Tennis Association's National Junior Doubles championship for boys and girls age 14‚Äì16, an event which continued after the demise of the ITF event. Proceeds from the tournament benefited New York Junior Tennis and Learning.2010 Bronx Open at ITF website The Bronx Open was revived in 2019 as a WTA International tournament, held at the park and hosted by New York Junior Tennis and Learning.  In popular culture  Crotona Park is depicted in Abraham A. Manievich's \\"Autumn, Crotona Park, Bronx\\" ( 1922-1925), owned by the National Art Museum of Ukraine, and was also referenced in Clifford Odets's play Waiting for Lefty (1935). Additionally, the jazz flutist Dave Valentin, a South Bronx native, named the first track of his 1983 release Flute Juice after the park.

It was originally known as \\"Trinity\\" when it was first opened but later \\"Holy Trinity\\" before reverting to its original name. As well as being part of the Church of England, it is a major contributor to the New Wine network. The Church has around 1000 members, making it one of the largest churches in the UK. A recent article cited it as the 11th largest church in Britain. Christianity Magazine article Location The main church building is located on Portland Street, Cheltenham. The church also owns Trinity House and Trinity Fusion, behind the church building on Trinity Lane, and its offices are located in Winchcombe House.  Senior leadership and staff  * Reverend Andrew Blyth - Lead Pastor * Reverend Tim Grew ‚Äì Pastor * Reverend Gareth Dickinson ‚Äì Pastor * David Baker - Pastor * Helen Stott ‚Äì Churchwarden * James Mears ‚Äì Churchwarden Trinity also employs a number of staff on a full-time or part-time basis, and all of its events and activities are facilitated by a large number of volunteers. Trinity Cheltenham Website - Meet The Team  History  Trinity Church came into being in 1824 as an overflow from the Parish Church in the town centre. The first minister was the Rev Francis Close, Rector of Cheltenham and later Dean of Carlisle Cathedral, after whom the Dean Close School was named. The Church was opened with an address from the Rev Charles Simeon. In 1976, Trinity Church was on the point of closure. However, under the ministry of a retired missionary (Canon Lawrence Totty) change had slowly begun to happen. The threat of closure was removed and under two subsequent vicars, Rev John Risdon and Rev Paul Harris, the church continued to grow and start to reach out into the community.  Current Activity  In 1994 Mark Bailey was appointed pastor, and since then the church has undergone a major refurbishment: pews have been replaced with chairs, carpet fitted, pipe organ removed, and the d√©cor changed to enable greater flexibility in the building's use. In 2000, Trinity House, the three- storey building immediately behind the church, was purchased. The additional space has greatly increased the opportunities for ministry. As well as the Sunday services each week, the church members participate in a large array of mid-week activities, which include the Alpha Course, 'King's Table', Life Groups and Kids, Youth and Student activities. There are now more than 1,000 people who worship on a regular basis. Continued growth presented logistical problems, and by the end of 2004 the church started holding multiple services each Sunday. In January 2005 the 'Trinity Growth Project' was launched and most of the staff and administrative team moved out of Trinity House to offices in Winchcombe House. In 2008 the church purchased the Fusion Building next to Trinity House on Winchcombe Street, and in 2009 began a refurbishment of the main church building to increase the capacity to nearly 650. Mark Bailey resigned as team rector and accepted a two-year suspension from ministry by the Bishop of Gloucester in 2016.

Mohardt attended the University of Notre Dame from 1918 through 1921 where he played football under Knute Rockne and also competed in baseball and track and field. He was selected as an All-American halfback in 1921 but lost his last year of collegiate eligibility for participating in a professional football game against the Green Bay Packers in December 1921. Mohardt played professional baseball for the Detroit Tigers for five games in April 1922 and also played in the minor leagues during the 1922 and 1923 seasons. He also played professional football in the National Football League for four seasons with the Chicago Cardinals (1922‚Äì1923), Racine Legion (1924), and Chicago Bears (1925). He shared the backfield with Red Grange in 1925. After retiring from athletics, Mohardt became a medical doctor. He served as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War II in the North African and Italian Campaigns. He later became a surgeon at a veterans hospital and eventually the assistant director of the Veterans Administration's Surgical Service. Early years Mohardt was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in January 1898. His family moved to Gary, Indiana, while he was a child. At the time of the 1920 U.S. Census, Mohardt was living in Gary with his parents and nine younger siblings. Both of his parents were immigrants from Austria, and his father worked as a pipe fitter in a sheet mill.Census entry for George and Catherine Mohardt. Son John Mohardt age 21, born in Pennsylvania, listed as a student at Notre Dame College. Source Citation: Year: 1920; Census Place: Calumet, Lake, Indiana; Roll: T625_446; Page: 6B; Enumeration District: 92; Image: 18. Ancestry.com. 1920 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. After the tenth grade, Mohardt dropped out to work in a local steel mill. He worked in the mill for two years before enrolling at the University of Notre Dame. According to Mohardt's son, Mohardt was given two tests by Notre Dame officials‚Äîrunning and throwing‚Äîwhich he passed and enrolled at Notre Dame in 1918 at age 20. Notre Dame Mohardt attended the University of Notre Dame from 1918 to 1921. While there, he participated and received varsity letters in football, baseball, and track. He was both a pitcher and an outfielder at Notre Dame, compiled a batting average of almost .330 in three years of baseball, and was the captain of Notre Dame's 1921 baseball team. He also exhibited \\"an exceptional arm,\\" had speed, and was a good fielder. In football, he played halfback under coach Knute Rockne and was a teammate of George Gipp. Mohardt had \\"a powerful physique,\\" though weighing only 160 pounds, and with the exception of a broken nose sustained in a football game in 1920, he was never seriously injured in three years of football at Notre Dame. Mohardt played in Gipp's shadow in 1919 and 1920, but became the team's star in 1921. Mohardt led the 1921 Notre Dame team to a 10-1 record with 781 rushing yards, 995 passing yards, 12 rushing touchdowns, and nine passing touchdowns. Grantland Rice wrote that \\"Mohardt could throw the ball to within a foot or two of any given space\\" and noted that the 1921 Notre Dame team \\"was the first team we know of to build its attack around a forward passing game, rather than use a forward passing game as a mere aid to the running game.\\" Mohardt was selected as a first-team member of 1921 College Football All- America Team by Lawrence Perry and a second-team All-American by Walter Camp. The authors of The Notre Dame Football Encyclopedia wrote of Mohardt: > Had he come along at another time or at another school, Mohardt might have > gone down as one of the best college football players ever. His misfortune > was that he played on some of the best Notre Dame teams in history and in > the same backfield as the great George Gipp.\\" In early 1922, Mohardt lost his eligibility to continue playing for Notre Dame after it was discovered that he had played in a professional football game. He was initially alleged with joining other Notre Dame football players in participating in a game for the Carlinville, Illinois football team in a professional game, but he denied doing so and claimed he was in class. He was subsequently charged with, and eventually admitted, playing for the Racine Legion team on December 4, 1921, in a professional game against the Green Bay Packers. Mohardt also reportedly played semi-pro baseball in Iowa while attending Notre Dame during the summer of 1920, compiling a .309 batting average. While playing in Iowa, Mohardt is reported to have used the alias, John Cavanaugh, which was the name of the Catholic priest who was then the president of Notre Dame. Mohardt was reported to be \\"one of the most brilliant students who has ever left Notre Dame.\\" Professional baseball Mohardt signed to play professional baseball for the Detroit Tigers in February 1922. He was also offered contracts from the five other major league teams and chose Detroit because they agreed that they would allow him to leave the team in the fall of 1922 to attend medical school. Mohardt traveled to Augusta, Georgia, where he participated in Detroit's spring training. He made the regular season roster, but he appeared in only five games for the Tigers, making his debut on April 15, 1922, and playing in his final game seven days later. In two plate appearances, he had a single and a base on balls and scored two runs. In three appearances in the outfield, he had one putout and no errors. He left major league baseball with perfect 1.000 batting average and fielding percentage and two runs scored in his only two plate appearances. With the Tigers having Ty Cobb, Harry Heilmann and Bobby Veach in the outfield, Mohardt was unlikely to get significant playing time. Accordingly, after a short stay in Detroit, manager Ty Cobb decided to send Mohardt to the minor leagues for seasoning. The Detroit Free Press noted: \\"Although Mohardt gives promise of developing into a great player, he isn't ready for regular assignment in the major leagues.\\" On April 26, 1922, Mohardt was assigned to the Denver Bears baseball team in the Western League. He subsequently appeared in 22 games for the Syracuse Stars in 1922, compiling a .185 batting average. He also played as a first baseman for the Greenville Spinners in the South Atlantic Conference in 1923. He appeared in 15 games for Greenville and compiled a .280 batting average. Professional football Mohardt also played four years of professional football from 1922 to 1925. He was the starting right halfback for the Chicago Cardinals during the 1922 and 1923 seasons. In 1924, he played at the wingback position for the Racine Legion. In 1925, Mohardt signed to play halfback for George Halas's Chicago Bears. After Mohardt signed with the Bears, the team also signed Red Grange. Grange began the season as the Bears' lead halfback, and Mohardt was relegated to a secondary role. During a game in Pittsburgh, Grange ruptured a blood vessel in his arm while throwing a block for Mohardt. Grange missed the remainder of the season, and Mohardt became the Bears' starting left halfback. On November 22, 1925, Mohardt scored the Bears' first touchdown in a 21‚Äì0 victory over the Green Bay Packers. In 1926, Mohardt signed with the Chicago Bulls of the newly formed American Football League. On October 17, 1926, the Bulls played against the New York Yankees, an NFL team featuring Mohardt's former teammate, Red Grange. The game drew a crowd of 16,000 to the Bulls' home field. The first half ended in a scoreless tie, but Mohardt scored two touchdowns in the second half to lead the Bulls to a 14‚Äì0 victory over Grange and the Yankees.Grange 1953, at p. 115.Carroll 2007, at p. 94.(\\"Johnny Mohardt, Bulls left halfback, scored both of the touchdowns.\\") Later years During the summers of 1923 and 1924, Mohardt attended the University of Wisconsin. He also played semi-pro baseball with the Madison Blues while attending Wisconsin. Mohardt subsequently attended Northwestern University Medical School and had a one-year internship at Chicago Mercy Hospital. In March 1928, he began a three-year fellowship in surgery at the Mayo Clinic. In April 1930, Mohard married Dorothy Ann Harrison in a ceremony in Rockford, Illinois. Mohardt subsequently opened a private medical practice on Michigan Avenue in Chicago and became known as one of the leading brain specialists in the Midwest. In January 1942, at age 43, and after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Mohardt closed his medical office on Michigan Avenue in Chicago and enlisted in the United States Army. While waiting to be called to active duty, Mohardt told a reporter he felt \\"just like he did when he sat on the bench and the late Knute Rockne sent him into his first college game.\\" Mohardt served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, attaining the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was assigned to the 12th General Hospital Unit and served there during the North African and Italian Campaigns. He later became a surgeon at a veterans hospital in Bayard, New Mexico, and eventually served as the assistant director of the Veterans Administration's Surgical Service.Carroll 2007, at p. 95. After retiring, Mohardt moved to La Jolla, California. In November 1961, at age 63, Mohardt committed suicide at his home in La Jolla by severing the femoral artery in his groin. He was buried at the Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego, California.Burial record for John Henry Mohardt, interment date December 8, 1961.

Determination to live up to family heritage ... Early years DeLoach was born in San Diego, California to Jesse Howell DeLoach and Berta Pe√±a, a woman from Texas of Hispanic-American descent. DeLoach's father was a Chief Yeoman when he met Ms Pe√±a, who at that time (early 1950s) worked building F-102 fighters at the Convair plant in San Diego. DeLoach's father received a commission in 1960 through the Limited Duty Officer program and as a result, the family was in a constant state of relocation, with DeLoach attending schools in various states. DeLoach's family had a strong tradition of Naval Service. His grandfather was a Chief Machinist's Mate in the Navy and served for 23 years from 1922 to 1945. DeLoach received his first taste of what Navy life when he was a teenager and his father took him out on his minesweeper for two weeks. This experience plus, the fact that it was his family's tradition to serve in the Navy were influential factors when in 1974 he choose to attend the United States Naval Academy upon his graduation from First Colonial High in Virginia Beach, Virginia.Daily News online Retrieved: April 8, 2007 Because of a permanent injury to his right shoulder from birth, DeLoach barely passed the entrance physical exam and medical screening to get into the Naval Academy.The type of shoulder injury suffered by DeLoach is known as Brachial Plexus Injury. The brachial plexus is an arrangement of nerve fibers (a plexus) running from the spine (vertebrae C5-T1), through the neck, the axilla (armpit region), and into the arm. DeLoach passed the physical as a result of his parent's early intervention and persistent exercising of his arm.

Using a variety of remote sensing instruments, researchers from NOAA, the Office of Naval Research, and East Carolina University conducted the first comprehensive hunt for lost Civil War vessel. The USS Alligator was the first submarine built during the Civil War by the Union Navy. The Navy wanted such a vessel to counter the threat posed to its wooden-hulled blockaders by the former screw frigate Merrimack which, according to intelligence reports, the Norfolk Navy Yard was rebuilding as an ironclad ram for the Confederacy (the CSS Virginia).

He is also the President of Fretilin, and he was President of the National Parliament of East Timor from 2002 to 2007. As the Fretilin candidate, he stood in the 2007 presidential election and 2012 presidential election, but was defeated in the second round by independent candidates on both occasions. He also contested the 2017 presidential election, and with the support of former Prime Minister Xanana Gusm√£o and his party, National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT), he was elected as President. Life and career Born in Ossu in 1954, Guterres has described himself as ‚Äúthe son of a poor family, of humble people‚Äù. He is a Roman Catholic and a former guerrilla fighter. At an Extraordinary Conference of Fretilin in Sydney, Australia in 1998, Guterres was named General Coordinator of the Council of Armed Resistance. In July 2001, he was elected President of Fretilin. Guterres was elected to the Constituent Assembly in the August 2001 parliamentary election, and he was subsequently elected by the Constituent Assembly as its president; when East Timor gained its independence in May 2002, the Constituent Assembly was transformed into the National Parliament, with Guterres as its president. In the 2007 presidential election, Guterres ran as Fretilin's candidate and campaigned on a populist platform. However, some members of Fretilin blamed him for the 2006 East Timorese crisis and instead supported Prime Minister Jos√© Ramos-Horta, who was running as an independent candidate. In the first round of the election, held on 9 April, Guterres took first place with 27.89% of the vote. He and Ramos-Horta participated in the second round in May, and Guterres lost with 31% of the vote against 69% for Ramos-Horta. He accepted the result and congratulated Ramos-Horta. Guterres was re-elected to parliament in the June 2007 parliamentary election as the first name on Fretilin's candidate list. In the 2017 presidential election, Guterres ran again as the Fretilin candidate, with the support of former Prime Minister Xanana Gusm√£o and his party, National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT). Early results indicated that he won more than 50% of votes in the first round. Guterres took office on 20 May 2017 as the first elected partisan President of East Timor.

It was published in 1995 by TSR, Inc. (now Wizards of the Coast, a subsidiary of Hasbro). The module is for characters of levels 5-7. Plot summary Sword and Crown, TSR's first adventure for the Birthright campaign world, quickly embroils player characters in a major political incident. The occasion is a meeting of Anuire's leaders being held in the realm of a regent player character (PC). Things go awry when the daughter of one of the leading noble houses is kidnapped from the PC's realm by soldiers wearing the livery of a rival house. The PC regent and friends are called on to arbitrate and to rescue the princess. The PCs track the princess's kidnappers through the wilderness, unearthing clues that point to a cunning plot. They are accompanied by two knights from each of the rival houses and soldiers from the PC regent's retinue. The PCs encounter half-dead kidnappers ready to confess, so the PCs soon track down the perpetrator and learn the truth. When the PCs return with the princess they are forced to arbitrate between the two feuding houses, although matter the outcome, the PCs will earn the enmity of one of the noble houses. Sword and Crown involves the search for a lost princess, as the player characters go from elven laboratories to slave pens to fungus lakes, and face off against an adversary called the Spiritrender. = Notable nonplayer characters = * Aubrae Avan Anuireaen mage 2 * Aeric Boeruine Anuireaen fighter 12 * Prince Darien Avan Anuireaen fighter 9 Publication history Sword and Crown is an Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game supplement for the Birthright setting, published by TSR, Inc., and featuring a 64-page softcover book, and one 21‚Äôx 32‚Äô map sheet. The adventure was designed by Colin McComb and edited by Anne Brown, with cover art by Tony Szczudlo and illustrations by Ben Otero and John Dollar. Reception Cliff Ramshaw reviewed Sword and Crown for Arcane magazine, rating it a 6 out of 10 overall. Ramshaw comments that \\"with a party this size things can become unwieldy, and the author suggests you use Birthright skirmish rules to resolve large-scale combats\\". He notes that the adventure is \\"all fairly straightforward to referee until the closing scene\\" as it is \\"suggested that a trial takes place, but no mechanism is provided\\", and the fact that \\"the players will earn the enmity of one or the other of the noble houses [...] seems a trifle unfair, but I guess that's just the risks of power politics\\". Rick Swan reviewed Sword and Crown along with several other Birthright products for Dragon magazine #233 (September 1996), giving it a rating of 4 out of 6. Swan called this a first-rate example of an official adventure, \\"where the design team takes you by the hand and shows you what they consider the essentials of a Birthright campaign\\". He also called Sword and Crown \\"well-organized, clutter-free, and easy on the brain\\", and referred to the Spiritrender an \\"exceptionally nasty adversary\\". Swan felt that Colin McComb, co-designer of the original Birthright rules, \\"supplies plenty of staging tips and helpful NPCs ‚Äî too helpful, some might say\\", noting that a bandit conveniently volunteers too much information about his family at one point. He admitted that the adventure doesn't break any new ground, and relies on AD&D; conventions rather than concepts unique to the Birthright setting, so that the adventure acts as a bridge \\"intended to ease the transition from standard AD&D; to the more sophisticated Birthright setting\\". Swan recommended that, for a beginner on a budget looking to buy a Birthright adventure, to \\"go with Sword and Crown if you can't make up your mind\\", but that seasoned Birthright players who already have a campaign underway can skip the adventure.

The West End is predominantly middle class with many blocks of tree-lined older residential streets. However, it is also home to many students and small low rent units. Rising real estate prices have also led to some levels of gentrification. Boundaries West End United Baptist Church on Quinpool Road The border between the West and South End's of Halifax has crept north as the southern section has gentrified. While Jubilee Road has long been considered as the southern boundary, some now regard Quinpool Road as the area's southern edge. Quinpool is generally considered the heart of the West End, and site of such landmarks as the West End Baptist Church, the Oxford Theatre and a diverse array of small businesses. The northern boundary is also subject to interpretation but is widely regarded as Kempt Road and Windsor Street. The western boundary between the West End and Mainland Halifax is generally considered to run from the Northwest Arm and northward along Dutch Village Road and Joseph Howe Drive.Real Estate Map Areas, Daily News January 12, 2008, p.34 The neighbourhood is defined municipally by District 14 Connaught-QuinpoolHRM District 14 http://www.halifax.ca/districts/dist14/dist14.html and provincially as the Constituency of Halifax Chebucto.The Constituency of Halifax-Chebucto http://howardepstein.ca/constituencyinfo.htm History For the first century and a half of Halifax's history, the area of the West End was occupied by small farms and country estates. It was developed in the 1870s as residential streets were laid out. The growth of streetcar lines accelerated development.Halifax the First 250 Years Judith Fingard, David Sutherland, Janet Guildford (1999) Formac Publishing. Chebucto School was built in 1912 to serve the expanding neighbourhood and the building served as a morgue for the Halifax Explosion as it was close to the north end but relatively undamaged. Saunders Park Monument, the site of Chebucto Field airport In 1931, \\"Bluebell Farm\\" between Chebucto and Bayers Road was converted to Chebucto Field, the first airport in Halifax with terminal buildings near Connaught and Chebucto Road. Today the air field location is marked by Saunders Park. Simpsons built a large department store in the West end in the 1930s, the first retail centre outside the downtown. The large remaining open areas of the West End filled with housing after World War II with many blocks of Victory Houses and 1950s suburban homes. The West End was severely affected by Hurricane Juan in 2003 as the high density of large, older trees in the neighbourhood resulted in many toppled trees, damaged houses, blocked streets and prolonged power outages. A major controversy in 2008 was a project to widen Chebucto Road. Opponents argued it would increase traffic volume, noise and waste two million dollars better spent on public transit, while supporters argued it would reduce commuting times and congestion in the expanding municipality. Despite a widespread protest by environmentalists and West End residents, and after some consultation with residents and a public information campaign,the widening went ahead, albeit slightly altered in that it did not require the demolition of a house originally set to be destroyed.\\"Chebucto Road Reconstruction\\", The Coast June 19, 2008 Notes References * Raddall, Thomas H.

He spent considerable time in France and his work was profoundly influenced by Claude Monet. Biography Wynford Dewhurst was born Thomas Edward Smith to an affluent familyhttps://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/dec/07/wynford-dewhurst- art-of-manchester-monet-goes-on- showhttp://www.pennilesspress.co.uk/NRB/wynford_dewhurst.htm in Manchester in 1864. He was educated at home by a private tutor and later at Mintholme College. Although he originally trained to enter the legal profession, he showed artistic flair and decided to pursue a career as a painter after some of his drawings were published in various journals. He gained artistic training in France at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, in Paris (at which time he changed his name to Wynford Dewhurst by deed poll),https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/dec/07/wynford-dewhurst- art-of-manchester-monet-goes-on-show where he was a pupil of the renowned French painter Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me. Despite his teacher G√©rome's rejection of the radical Impressionist movement in favour of a highly finished academic style (G√©rome continued the development and conservation of French Neoclassicism), Dewhurst was heavily influenced by the Impressionists. It is well known that he first encountered Impressionism, to which he was instantly attracted, in the work of Emile Claus in the Maddocks Collection in Bradford. However his most important mentor would become Claude Monet. It was Monet to whom Dewhurst dedicated his pioneering account of French Impressionism, Impressionist Painting: its genesis and development, in 1904. This was the first important study of the French painters to be published in English. As well as helping to reintroduce British artists to this style of painting, Dewhurst's book called attention to the French Impressionists' debt to the British artists John Constable and J. M. W. Turner, claiming that the Impressionists simply developed their existing painterly techniques.\\"(By the turn of the century) British painters, if not the British public, had reconciled themselves to impressionism.\\" McConkey, Kenneth, British Impressionism (Oxford: Phaidon, 1989), p. 139. According to Dewhurst, artists who, like himself, painted in an impressionist manner, were often \\"sneered at for imitating a foreign style\\",Wynford Dewhurst, quoted by Kenneth McConkey, British Impressionism (Oxford: Phaidon, 1989), p. 140. and he was keen to justify their position. \\"French artists simply developed a style which was British in its conception\\",Wynford Dewhurst, Impressionist Painting: its genesis and development (London: George Newnes, 1904), pp. 4‚Äì5. he wrote, a view that was dismissed by French painters such as Pissarro, who revealed his national bias when he acknowledged Constable and Turner but identified instead French influences like Nicolas Poussin, Claude Lorrain, Jean-Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot.\\"It is true that Turner and Constable have been useful to us, as all painters of great talent have ... But the basis of our art is evidently French\\". Tucker, Paul Hayes, Monet in the '90s (Yale University Press, 1989), p. 267. However, Pissarro had earlier told an interviewer: \\"It seems to me that we are all descended from the Englishman Turner. He was the first who could make colors blaze with a natural brilliance.\\" House, John, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 113.\\"Pissarro objected to this preposterous claim ... This comforting theory remained vaguely absurd to the initiated of an earlier generation.\\" McConkey, p. 140. The thesis that Dewhurst put forward in Impressionist Painting was controversial, for it dealt with the debated question of whether Impressionism was French or British in origin. However, it found much support in Britain: Kevin McConkey informs us that Dewhurst's theme \\"was taken up by others as various as Clausen, John Rothenstein and Kenneth Clark\\"Kenneth McConkey, Impressionism in Britain, exh. cat. (New Haven: Yale University Press in association with Barbican Art Gallery, 1995), p. 82.Support for Dewhurst's theory can be found in the publications of these writers at the following page references: :*Kenneth Clark, Landscape into Art, 1949, pp. 86‚Äì107. (Pages refer to the Pelican edition of this book, 1956). :*George Clausen, Royal Academy Lectures on Painting, 1913, p. 128. :*John Rothenstein, Nineteenth-Century Painting, 1932, p. 178. :*Also see: D. S. MacColl, Nineteenth Century Art, 1902. Nevertheless, Dewhurst's \\"detailed biographical notices of the most prominent artists associated with the rise of impressionism in France ... leave little to be desired from the historical point of view\\".Review of Dewhurst's book 'Impressionist Painting' in The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs. vol. 5, no. 15, June 1904, pp. 320‚Äì321. It is worth noting that Impressionist Painting also included an entire chapter on female artists, since \\"modernity is the note of Impressionism, and that movement was the very first artistic revolt in which women took part\\".Dewhurst, Impressionist Painting, p. 77. Indeed, Dewhurst thanks the celebrated female painter Mary Cassatt (who worked within the Impressionist circle) for her assistance in the preface of his book. During his career Dewhurst became known for his paintings of the countryside around Dieppe and the Seine valley, where he painted regularly, and he confessed that it was here that his most significant artistic revelations occurred. For example, he discovered the violet light found in Monet's mid-day canvases: Throughout his life Dewhurst exhibited frequently at the Royal Society of British Artists, the New English Art Club from 1909 to 1910 and at the Royal Academy (where he also lectured on art) from 1914 to 1926. He held two one-man shows in London; the first was at the Walker Galleries in 1923, and in 1926 he held a significant exhibition of his pastels at the Fine Art Society. He also exhibited several times in Paris and Venice, in Buenos Aires in 1910, in Rome in 1911, and held a series of solo exhibitions in Germany. Examples of his work can be found in public collections: Three paintings, including Summer Mist, Valley of La Creuse (c. 1920), are in the collection of the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff. The Picnic (1908), a celebrated picture which exemplifies the influence of Monet in its use of small dabs of colour, resulting in an optical blend of hues when seen from a distance, is in the collection of Manchester City Art Gallery. Later years Dewhurst's mature work demonstrates a more expressive handling. This is especially evident in a series of paintings he produced in the valley of La Creuse, where the bright, almost garish palette again recalls Monet, although in some instances they achieve \\"an unintended Fauvist intensity.\\"McConkey, Impressionism in Britain, p. 120. In 1995, Dewhurst was included in an important exhibition called 'Impressionism in Britain' at the Barbican Art Gallery, London, which demonstrated that the proliferation of Impressionism was not, contrary to popular belief, exclusive to France, but flourished in Britain as well where Dewhurst played an important role. Personal life Dewhurst had married Antonia von B√ºlow, of a German aristocratic family;http://www.pennilesspress.co.uk/NRB/wynford_dewhurst.htm they had six children, including Royal Marine Colonel Frederick Wynford Dewhurst, who married Patricia, dau. of Sir Thomas Richard Pennefather Warren, 8th Baronet.The Oldie, 1 Feb. 2017, URL= https://www.pressreader.com/uk/the- oldie/20170201/281513635873291 Date accessed= 15 Sep. 2018Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 2003, vol. 3, p. 4077 Legacy The first major retrospective of Dewhurst, Wynford Dewhurst: Manchester‚Äôs Monet, was organised by Manchester Art Gallery from 9 December 2016 to 23 April 2017.

Early years Born in Bronx, New York, Friedman spent her formative years in the San Fernando Valley, north of Los Angeles after her family moved to Southern California when she was 10. She started playing guitar at the age of eight while listening to Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Josh White. After moving to California, Friedman recalled feeling \\"very isolated\\" with few friends, so she started playing guitar in her room. Her first song gained her a spot on the television talent show Rocket to Stardom at age 12. While at Ulysses S. Grant High School, she started playing \\"Hoot Nights\\" at The Troubadour in West Hollywood, where she met the musicians Steve Mann and Hoyt Axton and became part of the growing musical scene of Los Angeles. Career Her first paid performance was at the Green Spider Coffee House in Denver, Colorado at the age of nineteen. Soon she was part of the \\"Hippie Migration,\\" traveling the California Coast and living off earnings from her performances. While staying in San Francisco, California, Friedman befriended the members of Jefferson Airplane, Country Joe and Janis Joplin. Her friendship with Van Dyke Parks not only influenced her deep commitment to music but also introduced her to The Association, who recorded her song \\"Windy\\" in 1967. Friedman wrote \\"Windy\\" in 20 minutes while living in an apartment in David Crosby's house. In 1968, she was part of the band Petrus, which also included Peter Kaukonen. Two years later, Constant Companion, her first solo album, was released by Reprise Records. She also wrote and sang the songs for the cult movie The Peace Killers, released in 1971. While on tour promoting the album, Friedman suddenly returned to her family's Los Angeles home after a family tragedy and stopped recording music altogether in 1972‚Äì73. In 2006, Water, a San Francisco label, reissued Constant Companion, renewing interest in Friedman's music. Prior to the 2006 reissue, Friedman had been out of the music business for more than thirty years, spending the intervening time running her own stationery company, raising two daughters and earning a degree in English from UCLA. Later in 2006, Water released a compilation of rare and previously unreleased home recordings from 1965‚Äì1971, Hurried Life. After the re-release of Constant Companion, Friedman was invited to play at a local festival. She recalls that she had \\"to learn to play [guitar] again\\" and was taught the songs from her album by a guitarist at a local folk venue, McCabe's Guitar Shop in Santa Monica, but \\"it took about two years [of practicing] for me to get my chops back.\\" Friedman has been performing locally in Los Angeles since that time.

They played LSU in the Sugar Bowl and led after the first half, but lost Other future pros in Wyoming's backfield that season included senior Jim Kiick, who was part of two Super Bowl championship teams with the Miami Dolphins, and Vic Washington, who helped the San Francisco 49ers win three consecutive NFC West division titles Professional career Hampton was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the ninth round of the 1969 NFL/AFL Draft in late in what turned out to be general manager Vince Lombardi's last official function with the club before becoming coach and general manager of the Washington Redskins the Hampton was expected to fill the shoes of retired legends Jim Taylor and Paul Hornung, but in three years with Green Bay, he, along with the rest of the Packers' aging offense, struggled. His best success came with the Atlanta Falcons, where he was traded prior to the 1972 season. In his first year with the team, Hampton surpassed the 1,000-yard rushing yard mark during the Falcons' final game of the season against the Kansas City Chiefs. As part of a planned celebration for the Falcons' first 1,000-yard rushing season, the game was paused as Hampton was presented with a trophy and the game ball for his accomplishment. However, he was tackled for a six-yard loss on the following play and ended the season with 995 yards. In 1973, he had another chance to get a 1,000-yard rushing season, but he ended up three yards shy. After missing most of the 1974 season due to injury, he rushed for 1,002 yards in 1975 and received the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award.

The town is situated at the far end of the Gulf of G√∂kova, at the start of the fertile G√∂kova plain, and is a rising center for international tourism. It is the first coastal town encountered on the busy road from the province center of Muƒüla to the resort center of Marmaris. Nearby Sakar Pass is a paragliding spot where the road descends from an altitude of 670m to sea-level in the space of a pine-clad section of a dozen kilometers along very sharp curves. At the base of the hill is the intersection to Akyaka. The township of Akyaka is sometimes referred to as G√∂kova, after the name of the gulf and the plain, while there is also an inland township of G√∂kova neighbouring Akyaka, itself of visitor's interest and whose intersection is slightly further ahead from that of Akyaka in the direction of Marmaris. History Much of the G√∂kova plain had been unproductive for centuries, until the later half of the 20th century, and was covered with marshlands ridden with malaria. The inhabitants abandoned their settlements and fields entirely during the months of active malaria and moved to highland plateaus (yayla). The arable land available was usually owned by large landowners from the district center of Ula. An organized program to combat malaria, one of the priorities of the young Turkish Republic of the 1920s, was enacted under a specific law in 1926, in the frame of which ownership titles were awarded to individuals or groups of people on the basis of the swampland they drained, and were quite successful in the transformation of Akyaka region, especially through the local projects lasting from 1925 to 1940. In the following decades, conversion of fields for cash crops, particularly tobacco, dominated the local economy and this until the 1970s when the first steps in the tourism industry were taken. Akyaka became quite cosmopolitan in recent years. =Idyma= Safe altitude considerations governed the choice for settlements of the ancients as well. G√∂kova town, inland from Akyaka was the location of the historic city of Idyma, some of whose remains reaching back at least to the 4th century BC, when it was founded as a Carian city, are still visible. Idyma urban zone may have extended as large as the area between the immediate east of Akyaka well beyond the village of Kozlukuyu, a dependent neighborhood of the town of G√∂kova, 3 km away. The acropolis, city walls 200 meters in length and around fifty rock tombs are located along the steep climb (sea level to 400 meters) of K√º√ß√ºk Sakar at Kozlukuyu. The Acropolis was explored by the French archaeologist Louis Robert in 1937. In 546 BC, the Persian armies under the command of Harpagos conquered the area, but the Carian customs and the religion remained unchanged. Delian League took over between 484 and 405 BC and Idyma is mentioned in the tax lists for the years 453-452 BC, the earliest written document on the city. The same reports mention a local sovereign by the name of Paktyes, whose descendants may have founded a dynasty which governed Idyma and to whose members the rock tombs could be attributable.A Manites, son of Paktyes, is recorded as having attempted on Mausolus's life in 355 BC. A mint city, Idyma produced its own coins, one side of which was marked with the name Idimion, and the other side with the head of a Pan, hinting at a shepherd's cult. From 167 BC to at least the 2nd century AD, Idyma, together with the entire region south of Muƒüla (Mobolla) was part of the Rhodes's mainland possessions (Per√¶a Rhodiorum). A Byzantine castle worth restoring also stands on the slopes of Sakar and a tunnel leads to the bank of the stream of Azmakdere or Kadƒ±n Azmak, possibly named Idymus in ancient times. Because of the extent of the ancient site, in terms both of its area and longevity, some of its archaeological finds are associated with Akyaka, while many with G√∂kova and particularly Kozlukuyu. Azmak Stream Azmak is the name in short of a short but deep stream which joins the sea in Akyaka and formed by springs extending about two miles from East to West. Its depth allows boats to ascend it for a considerable distance and the richness of its underwater fauna made it a favorite spot for daily boat tours around Akyaka and for scuba diving. The water is cold and slightly salty due its level course with the sea across the plain, but watercress and celery thrive in Azmak and restaurants along its course make the stream a symbol and an important point of attraction for Akyaka region. The word \\"azmak\\", sometimes used to describe a river, means \\"running wild\\" in Turkish, in a reference to the stream's strong, rather than violent, current, especially in winter. Akyaka's azmak is also referred to under the fuller name of \\"Kadƒ±n Azmak\\", qualifying it with female attributes and distinguishing it from azmak of Ak√ßapƒ±nar at the opposite side of the same plain, or from namesakes in Gallipoli Peninsula or Bulgaria.  Architecture  Architecture in the Mugla houses as seen in the wood handcrafted shutters, balconies, doors and roof Akyaka district is featured with its architectural structure and applies a uniform construction regulation. Thus, the district has formed a distinct building structure exclusive to Akyaka by combining the style of former Ula houses, an old town near the provincial capital of Muƒüla, which provided the inspiration for the architecture of Akyaka, with modern architecture style. These flowery gardened double stair houses were designed with wooden balconies and overhanging roofs. The ceiling decorations are also notable at Akyaka, which is known for its authentic houses. The architectural style of Akyaka houses was created by Nail √áakƒ±rhan.

They are usually devoted to a particular historical theme and usually span six lectures over Hilary term. They are often subsequently published as a book. History of the lectureship The lectures are named in honour of their benefactor, James Ford (1779‚Äì1851). Ford was educated at King's School, Canterbury, and matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, in 1797. After graduating in 1801, he went on to his Master of Arts and Bachelor of Divinity degrees. He was a Fellow of Trinity College from 1807 to 1830. His antiquarian collections have been dispersed, but survive in the holdings of the Bodleian Library, the Library of Trinity College, the British Library, and the Cambridge University Library. Samuel Rawson Gardiner (1829‚Äì1902), who delivered the first Ford Lectures in 1896‚Äì7 In his will, Ford left a number of bequests, some of which were held in trust for the support of his surviving siblings. After they had all died, Oxford University received his bequest of ¬£2,000 to fund a professorship of English history, which was to be established when the principal had grown to support payment of ¬£100 per year. When this goal was reached in 1894, the sum was not enough to support a professor at the current stipend. After considerable discussion within the University, the funds were assigned to fund an annual lectureship in English history by a lecturer who was to be chosen annually by a board of electors. The first Ford's Lecturer in English History was S. R. Gardiner, elected for the academic year beginning in 1896. In 1994, the University of Oxford formally changed the official title of the series from \\"Ford's Lectures in English History\\" to \\"Ford's Lectures in British History\\". As the lectures may be given in either the Michaelmas or Hilary terms (or partly in both), confusion can arise on publication because either calendar year may be stated.

It was released in North America by Atlus the same year, under the expanded title Brigandine: The Legend of Forsena. In 2000, Hearty Robin released a remake of the game called Brigandine: Grand Edition, which included multiplayer support, along other new features. In the game, the player chooses one of the nations of the fictional continent of Forsena, and has the goal of conquering the other nations by taking their castles, using troops composed of human commanders and fictional creatures. Although primarily a turn-based strategy game, the game includes some characteristics of tactical role-playing games. A sequel titled Brigandine: The Legend of Runersia, developed by Matrix Software and published by Happinet, released on the Nintendo Switch on June 25, 2020. Gameplay In Brigandine, the player controls one of the six playable nations. Each nation possess a number of troops and castles. Each troop is composed of a human leader, called rune knight, and fictional creatures such as dragons, ghouls and fairies, which are called \\"monsters\\". The goal of the player is to conquer the entire continent by attacking the enemy castles with the controlled nation's troops (or troops from allied nations). Likewise, troops are also used to protect the controlled nation's castles from enemy troops' attacks. Brigandine features two gameplay modes, both turn-based: a preparation mode and a battle mode. Rune knights and monsters have statistics typical of role-playing video game, such as experience points, hit points, attack, defense, magic points, and the like. Rune knights also have character classes, and may switch between classes if some conditions are met. Monsters don't have classes, but may be upgraded to more powerful forms, called promotions, when they have reached a minimum level or some special items are used. The number of monsters which may join a troop is limited by the rune knight's rune power statistic. The entire nation has a leader, called ruler, which is a rune knight with a unique class, but otherwise similar to other rune knights. =Preparation mode= In this mode, each turn is represented by a in-game \\"month\\". The player may navigate and view statistics of all castles on the continent (although only the castles of the player's nation may be managed). Each month has an organize phase and an attack phase. In the organize phase, the player may re-allocate troops between castles, re-allocate monsters between troops, summon new monsters, equip and use items, change rune knights' classes, and promote monsters. The player may also send rune knights on quests. To summon additional monsters, mana must be spent. Each nation receives mana at the beginning of each turn. The amount of mana depends on the number of the castles belonging to the nation. Monsters also have an upkeep cost; they consume mana every turn. Because of this, there is the option of deleting monsters. Quest is not quite a gameplay mode, since they are not playable; they make the rune knight (and its troop) unavailable for a variable number of turns. During this time, the character is involved in events (mostly random), which may benefit or hinder the player. Rulers cannot go on quests. In the attack phase, each nation may send its own troops to adjacent enemy castles, which is treated as an attack. If the defending castle is occupied, a battle is marked to occur between the two groups of troops, unless the castle sending the troops is attacked first (the order of attack depends on the level of the rune knights). When battles are marked to occur, the game switches into the battle mode after the organize phase. =Battle mode= In this mode, each turn is a combat round. Battles take place in hexagonal grids; each unit (rune knight or monster) occupies one hexagon. Each unit, with rare exceptions, may act once on each turn, and the units belonging to the same troop must act in sequence. A unit's action usually consists in a movement followed by a physical attack, or by a magic spell/special attack. Each side may bring only up to 3 troops to a single battle, regardless of the number of troops that are attacking or defending the castle. Once a battle starts, the attacking side has 13 turns to gain victory, by defeating all troops of the opposing side. A troop is defeated by having its leader reduced to 0 hit points, or when the leader retreats. If the ruler of a nation is reduced to 0 hit points or retreats, all other rune knights belonging to the same side retreat. If the attacking side fails to gain victory within 13 turns, all its rune knights retreat. In battle, each rune knight has an area around it called rune area. Outside of this area, the monsters belonging to the rune knight's troop become weaker. When a rune knight is reduced to 0 hit points or retreats, the monsters belonging to its troop may either retreat or be captured by the opposing side. A monster which is outside the leader's rune area has an increased chance of being captured. Monsters which are reduced to 0 hit points are considered to be killed, and disappear forever. Rune knights reduced to 0 hit points become unavailable to be used for 1 in-game month, but aren't affected otherwise. Units and magic spells frequently have elements associated with them: red, blue, green, white or black. Physical attacks and spells from units associated with a certain element are more effective against units associated with the opposing element (red opposes blue, white opposes black). Likewise, physical attacks and spells are less effective against units associated with the same element. Plot The game begins with a scene showing Zemeckis, commander of the army of the Kingdom of Almekia, receiving a visit from a rune knight called Cador, who wields the title of \\"Death Knight\\". Zemeckis is convinced that he is being falsely accused of treason, and decides to rebel against the King of Almekia, Henguist. Zemeckis' rebellion is joined by other rune knights, and they successfully take over the country of Almekia, renaming it Esgares Empire. King Hengust dies in the hands of Cador, and the son of the King, Prince Lance, flees to the nearby Kingdom of Padstow with the rune knights who stayed loyal to the deceased king. These events are the trigger for the war between the countries of Forsena. Playable nations * New Almekia: The former Kingdom of Padstow, which was an ally of Almekia. King Coel abdicated the throne in favor of Prince Lance, who becomes the ruler of nation, renamed West Almekia (New Almekia in the American port of the game). Lance desires to fight to avenge his father and take back the kingdom which was stolen from him. * Caerleon: Known as \\"Magic Kingdom\\", Caerleon is a small country with powerful magic wielders. Caerleon allies itself with New Almekia early in the game. The ruler of the nation, Cai, is a powerful spellcaster and is known as the \\"Silent Wise King\\", who brings his country to war for the best of his people. * Norgard: An icy and large country in the north. The nation was weakened after losing a war against Almekia in the past, but now the new ruler, Vaynard, desires to restore his country to glory by conquering the entire continent. Vaynard is a brilliant strategist and known as the \\"White Wolf\\" for his bravery. * Iscalio: A chaotic country, filled with daily parties and celebrations. Its ruler is a tyrant named Dryst, who is also called \\"The Mad Monarch\\" due to his utter insanity. Dryst desires to wage war and conquer the entire continent of Forsena simply for fun. * Leonia: A religious and peaceful country, which ends up in the war just to protect itself. Its ruler, Queen Lyonesse, was a former village girl who became a ruler after being appointed by the prophecy. * Esgares Empire: The former Kingdom of Almekia, whose new ruler is now Emperor Zemeckis. Zemeckis doesn't have the ambition of power - he desires to conquer Forsena just because fighting is his only way of living. Unlike the other countries, Esgares is not normally playable; a cheat code must be used to control it. The Esgares game also has no plot cut scenes. However, some of the characters within the Esgares Empire have special quests, such as the twins Mira and Millet. Brigandine: Grand Edition The remake of the game released in 2000 had many significant changes, including: * Multiplayer game mode: allowing up to 6 players, each controlling a nation; * The Esgares Empire became a fully playable nation, and gained plot cut scenes; * Changes on battle mode gameplay: ** Like in the Fire Emblem series, elements became based on the Rock, Paper, Scissors rule: red is effective against green, green is effective against blue, and blue is effective against red. White and black still oppose each other; ** If, after 13 turns of battle, the attacking side has a unit over the defending side's castle, the attacking side now wins. * Monsters became able to equip items; * The player is redirected to a final boss, when the continent is successfully conquered; * The original 3D opening was replaced by an anime opening; * Many dialog-only cut scenes were replaced by anime cut scenes; * 3D battle animations replaced by simpler and faster 2D animations; * Major changes to the soundtrack; * New rune knights, character classes, items and monsters. * Japanese voice acting was added, including the voice talents of S≈çichir≈ç Hoshi, Mitsuaki Madono and Yuri Shiratori. Development Hearty Robin, then known as Easlystaff, demonstrated the game at the September 1997 Tokyo Game Show.

The company dominated the aerial wire ropeway industry during the first half of the 20th century, and its portfolio included cranes, electric cars, elevators, and mining and ship-loading equipment. Adolf Bleichert - Founder of the Bleichert Aerial Wire Ropeway System Postcard 1910 - Factory of Adolf Bleichert & Co. Leipzig-Gohlis Factry plan of Adolf Bleichert & Co. Leipzig-Gohlis  History  = 1874 until 1918 = In 1872 Adolf Bleichert started in Teutschenthal (Saxony, Germany) the design and manufacture of the first wire rope way (also called Aerial lift). Simultaneously with the successful start-up of this installation Adolf Bleichert founded (initially together with Theodor Otto) in 1874 near to Leipzig a company for the manufacture of wire rope ways. This was the beginning of Adolf Bleichert & Co. which in the 50 years, starting from 1874 until the middle of the 20th century, developed into a world renowned company of the highest standing. In 1881 Bleichert moved its offices to Leipzig- Gholis, which became the main factory facility located in a much bigger plant and it also was the Headquarter of the company. Starting from 1888 Bleichert expanded also to the Northamerican market by concluding a license agreement with the American company Cooper, Hewitt & Co., the mothercompany of the Trenton Iron Inc.,Trenton Iron later was incorporated into United States Steel Corporation through its subsidiary American Steel and Wire Company. which constructed and sold many material wire rope ways based on the Bleichert system. During World War I the Bleichert company developed a specific \\"field cable car\\" used by German military forces in mountain warfare in the Vosges Mountains, the Alpine and Balkan areas. Until World War I the Bleichert company realized many aerial cable cars, especially for material carriage, but even for passengers transportation, among this have been built the following in: * 1874: Aerial cableway installation on round bar rails for the solar oil and paraffin factory in Teutschenthal near Halle, Germany * 1876: Ropeway conveyor for the material transportation of Sayn Mine Works from Krupp company near to Bendorf, Germany * 1880: Aerial cableway for the transportation of iron ore from the Doihl Mine to the steelworks in Rodange, Luxembourg * 1890: Aerial cableway for the wood transportation of the Baina-Buschta region, Serbia * 1900: Aerial cableway for the miningworkings of the Kappler-Tunnel at the Schauinsland mountain in the Black Forest near to Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany * 1902: Aerial cableway for the coalmine activities at Grand-Hornu, Belgium * 1903: Aerial cableway for the coalmine activities at the Sumitomo- Besshi Copper Mine in Niihama, Japan * 1904: Aerial cableway for the Harpener Bergbau AG former mining company near to Dortmund, Germany * 1905: Aerial cableway for the Chilecito-La Mejicana gold mining industry, also called cable car from the Famatina pit, Argentina * 1906: Aerial cableway for the nickel ore loading facility of Soci√©t√© Le Nickel on the pacific coast at the French overseas territory of Thio, New Caledonia * 1906: Aerial cableway for the cement industry Alsenschen Portland-Zementfabrik in Itzehoe‚ÄìAgethorst / Wacken, Germany * 1908: Aerial cableway for the cole mining industry in Longyearbyen, Spitsbergen (Svalbard islands), Norway * 1909: Aerial cableway for the wood transportation of a sawmill in Mkumbara ‚Äì Neu Hornow, former German East Africa * 1909: Aerial cableway for the material trasportation of Toli Mines in the coal mining district of Shandong coastal province, China * 1913: Passengers aerial cableway Kohlerer Bahn in Bolzano, South Tyrol (former Austria-Hungary), Italy * 1913: Aerial cable cranes for the construction of the Centennial Hall in Wroclaw (Lower Silesia), Poland Adolf Bleichert & Co. company nameplate = 1918 until 1945 = Bleichert mainly built material carrying wire rope ways, but then diversified into passenger cable cars as well, such as the famous Predigtstuhl Aerial Tramway in the Alps, the Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car, Krossobanen in Norway, Table Mountain Aerial Cableway in South Africa, Burgberg Cable Car in Germany, Aeri de Montserrat in Catalunya and the Port Vell Aerial Tramway crossing the Port of Barcelona from Torre Sant Sebastia via Torre Jaume I to Montju√Øc, just to mention some of those. Share of the Adolf Bleichert & Co AG, issued Januar 1927 By the company‚Äôs 50th Anniversary in 1924, Adolf Bleichert & Co. had designed and built the world's record holding wire ropeways: Longest and highest elevation (Argentina); Length of system over water (New Caledonia); Steepest (Tanzania); Highest capacity (France); Northernmost (Norway); and, Southernmost (Chile). In 1926, the company went public, though was controlled by Bleichert‚Äôs two sons: Max von Bleichert and Paul von Bleichert. Due to the Great Depression and the collapse of the German banking system, on April 4, 1932, Adolf Bleichert & Co. filed for bankruptcy. Its successor, Bleichert-Transportanlagen GmbH, was incorporated on June 28, 1932 to carry on the firms work. Bleichert- Transportanlagen GmbH also became sole shareholder of Adolf Bleichert & Co. Drahtseilbahn GmbH, the people-mover manufacturing entity. Bleichert- Kabelbagger GmbH‚Äîthe wire rope crane division‚Äîbecame an independent entity, though also declared bankruptcy on July 4, 1932. No longer under Bleichert family control, the Bleichert-Transportanlagen GmbH factory continued to produce during the Second World War. = From 1945 = With the defeat of Nazi Germany, Leipzig‚Äîthe Saxon city where much of the company's factories were centered‚Äîfell on the eastern side of the Iron Curtain and Bleichert- Transportanlagen GmbH was taken over by the Occupying Power, the Soviet Union, and renamed SAG Bleichert. In 1954, SAG Bleichert was transferred to the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), and was renamed VEB Bleichert. Soon thereafter, the firm was continued under the name VEB Transportanlagenfabrik Bleichert Leipzig. In 1955, the company name changed again to VEB Schwermaschinenbau Verlade- und Transportanlagen Leipzig vorm.Bleichert. By 1959, the last reference to the original family business disappears, as ‚Äòvorm.Bleichert‚Äô is dropped from the firm‚Äôs name. Between 1962 and 1985, this entity went through several iterations. However, by 1991, the company had been privatized and entered liquidation, halting production of cranes, conveyance, and pit mining equipment ‚Äî thus concluding the history of the oldest and largest wire ropeway manufacturer of the world.

Each co-owner receives an individual deed at closing for his or her undivided percentage interest in the entire property. In brief, a TIC owner has the same rights and benefits as a single owner of property. Although the TIC ownership form has been used for many years, its popularity has recently started increasing dramatically due to IRS ruling. Exchangers often have difficulty in locating and closing suitable replacement property within the 45-day identification period and the 180-day closing period. 1031 TIC exchanges can significantly reduce these risks. How a 1031 exchange is accomplished The following sequence represents the order of steps in a typical 1031 exchange. #An investor decides to sell investment property and do a 1031 exchange. He contacts a qualified intermediary (QI) and they enter into an agreement. #The investment property is placed on the market. #An offer to purchase the investment property is accepted and signed by the QI. #Escrow for the sale is opened, and a preliminary title report is produced. #The QI sends required exchange documents to the escrow closer for signing at property closing. #Escrow closes. #Within the first 45 days after the close of escrow on the sale of the relinquished property, the investor identifies replacement properties as required by law. This is known as the \\"Identification Period\\". #Within 180 days after the close of escrow on the sale of the relinquished property, the investor closes on one of the replacement properties which he has identified. This is called the \\"Exchange Period\\". This completes the exchange. No cash ‚Äì or boot, as it is known ‚Äì is taken by the exchanger. An alternative to the 1031 exchange A structured sale annuity or \\"Ensured Installment Sale\\" is a capital gains tax deferral tool that enables the seller to gain benefits that other sales and capital gains deferral methods do not offer. It is a hybrid of the common installment sale and a structured annuity, and it enables the seller to collect a stream of payments, leverage equity, earn a pre-tax return, and other benefits. This method is a tool for those who want to do a 1031 exchange but cannot find a property within the time frame, and it allows the seller to have a backup plan.

Private life A native of Greenville, Alabama in Butler County, Walter Flowers attended public schools in Tuscaloosa and entered the University of Alabama where he earned degrees in 1955 and 1957. In 1957‚Äì58, Flowers continued his graduate studies in international law as a fellow at the University of London. He held a commission as a Reserve Lieutenant Officer in the US Army in Military Intelligence and practiced law in Alabama before his election to the United States Congress. At the time of his death, from a heart attack while playing tennis, he lived in McLean, Virginia. Political career On November 5, 1968, Walter Flowers was elected to the first of five successive terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1978 he sought the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate, but lost the primary to Howell Heflin who went on to serve three terms. Flowers did not seek political office again but retired from politics to McLean, Virginia, where he died on his fifty-first birthday.Walter Flowers dies; Alabama Congressman Burial was at Arlington National Cemetery. =Role in Watergate hearings= Flowers served on the House Judiciary Committee which voted to refer articles of impeachment against President Richard M. Nixon to the full House of Representatives in 1974. Flowers, a conservative Democrat, was considered to be leaning against the impeachment vote. After a long struggle, Flowers voted for impeachment. The congressman said \\"I felt that if we didn't impeach, we'd just ingrain and stamp in our highest office a standard of conduct that's just unacceptable.\\" Coming from a state which had supported Nixon in 1972, he was seen as influential even with some Republicans. He told the undecided Republicans on the committee, \\"This is something we just cannot walk away from. It happened, and now we've got to deal with it. =George Wallace= Flowers was influenced by former Alabama Governor George C. Wallace during his political career. Wallace said that during the Watergate hearings he tried to shield Flowers from increased pressure by refusing to forward a request, from Nixon, that he vote against impeachment. Flowers campaigned for Wallace and served as his national campaign chairman during Wallace's 1972 run for president.

He was active from 1740 until his death. He is thought to be from Rome, but worked in Naples from about 1751 to 1788. He was trained in the Neapolitan landscape tradition of Salvator Rosa (1615‚Äì1673) and Leonardo Coccorante (1680‚Äì1750), but was much more strongly influenced by the work of Claude Joseph Vernet, who visited Naples in 1737 and 1746. Bonavia‚Äôs paintings share with Vernet‚Äôs a rococo palette of pale blues, creamy yellows, pinks and soft green, as well as an atmospheric, rather than analytical, approach to landscape. Like Vernet, Bonavia painted capricci in which real features of the Neapolitan countryside were placed in imaginary settings. Bonavia‚Äôs idyllic landscapes were popular souvenirs of the Grand Tour. Among his patrons were Lord Brudenell and Count Karl Joseph Firmian, the Austrian ambassador to Naples 1753-8. Bonavia had a very successful career and was praised by Pietro Zani in his Enciclopedia Metodica Critico Ragionata delle Belle Arte (1794) as a fine painter of views and history subjects. The Accademia di San Luca (Rome), the Dulwich Picture Gallery, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museo di Capodimonte (Naples) and Stourhead (Wiltshire, England) are among the public collections having paintings by Carlo Bonavia.

The operation itself was part of Operation Achilles. The intention of the operation was to clear the area around the Kajakai Dam, belonging to Taliban fighters so this important power generation station could be reopened. Sporadic fighting had been occurring around the dam and the Taliban controlled the town of Musa Qala for around ten days as the Allied forces attempted to gain a foothold in the area so they could begin the offensive. The battle Allied Troops launched their offensive over the weekend of the 10th and 11th, little pre-raid bombing took place as to avoid damaging infrastructure in and around the dam. Destruction of the dam would have had grave results for both sides and the Afghan people. This may have been a major reason for the Taliban to not destroy it as they fled. Allied troops came under heavy small arms fire and light heavy arms fire including RPGs and bombs as they advanced towards the dam. Towards the end of the battle, it became obvious that although outnumbered, the ability of allied troops to cut the enemy's supplies was more demoralizing as Taliban forces started to flee the field of battle. Early Monday morning, allied forces carried out a pre-dawn bombing raid on Taliban forces located approximately in between the dam and the town, killing the Taliban commander Mullah Manan. This killing was seen as the straw that broke the camel's back, as not long after chaos ensued amongst the Taliban forces as they made a hasty retreat. This quote from Colonel Tom Collins describes the desperate Taliban retreat: Aftermath Although the Taliban never intended to topple the dam they still resorted to a semi-scorched earth policy. They destroyed or dismantled many of the complex mechanical components of the dam as they fled the field, to delay a NATO advance. Seizing of this dam and getting it up and running again was of great importance to the Allied troops, as restoring much needed power to the area would win support for the allied troops and the Afghan mission overall from the locals, as well as provide jobs in the energy sector. NATO reported that it suffered no casualties in the fighting, and that the number they killed or wounded is unknown. They did say however that they captured ten suspected militants during and after the battle. NATO also claims that no civilians were killed in the action (despite NATO claims that human shields were used), although this is refuted by local leaders.

It is approximately nine miles (14 km) from Dundee city centre and 13 miles (21 km) from Perth. The village is bypassed by on the A90 trunk road and benefits from a flyover (grade-separated) junction onto the road making it popular with commuters working in Dundee and further afield. Inchture is a prosperous village with a wide range of housing. The village comprises a post office, flower shop, a Spar store, hotel, a primary school, community centre and a church. There are approximately 100 original houses in the village and additional homes have been constructed by Muir Homes, Barratt Homes and Scotia Homes. The population is approximately 1500, with an active Community Council and much community engagement including an annual Village Fete. Inchture is situated within the Carse of Gowrie. Inchture is twinned with the village of Fl√©ac near Angoul√™me in France. At the east end of the village is a lodge and avenue that formerly led to the mansion of Rossie Priory, now cut off by the modern A90. This avenue is lined on both sides by giant redwood trees (Sequoiadendron giganteum). These were planted in 1853, and are the first known examples of the species successfully cultivated outside North America. An Episcopal Church, All Souls, was opened in 1896, the foundation stone having been laid four years earlier. Before this, the local Episcopalians had worshiped at a chapel on the Rossie Estate and later at a mission in Invergowrie. Near Inchture is Ballindean House, significant for its association with John Wedderburn of Ballendean (NB spelling) and his slave Joseph Knight and thus with the cause of abolitionism in the United Kingdom.

It divided the year into four seasons of exactly 13 weeks each. Each such season consisted of two 30-day months followed by one 31-day month, with the 31st day ending the season, so that Enoch's Year consisted of exactly 364 days. There is some evidence that the group whose writings were found at Qumran used a variation of the Enoch calendar (see Qumran calendar). The Enoch calendar was purportedly given to Enoch by the angel Uriel. Four named days, inserted as the 31st day of every third month, were named instead of numbered, which \\"placed them outside the numbering\\". The Book of Enoch gives the count of 2,912 days for 8 years, which divides out to exactly 364 days per year. This specifically excludes any periodic intercalations. Calendar expert John Pratt wrote that \\"The Enoch calendar has been criticized as hopelessly primitive because, with only 364 days, it would get out of sync with the seasons so quickly: in only 25 years the seasons would arrive an entire month early. Such a gross discrepancy, however, merely indicates that the method of intercalation has been omitted.\\"John Pratt, Review of Mapping Time:, The Calendar and Its History, by E. G. Richards, American Mathematical Monthly, volume 107, number 1, January, 2000 Pratt pointed out that by adding an extra week at the end of every seventh year (or Sabbatical year), and then adding two extra weeks to every fourth Sabbatical year (or every 28 years), the calendar could be as accurate as the Julian calendar.

The MTA defines the rights of the provider and the rights and obligations of the recipient with respect to the materials and any progeny, derivatives, or modifications. Biological materials, such as reagents, cell lines, plasmids, and vectors, are the most frequently transferred materials, but MTAs may also be used for other types of materials, such as chemical compounds, mouse models, and even some types of software. MTA types Three types of MTAs are most common at academic institutions: transfer between academic or research institutions, transfer from academia to industry and transfer from industry to academia. Each calls for different terms and conditions. For simple transfers not involving intellectual property, the NIH recommends a Simple Letter Agreement. For materials that may be patented or for which more protection is desired, the Uniform Biological Material Transfer Agreement (UBMTA) can be used. Many U.S. educational institutions have signed the UBMTA Master Agreement. AUTM (previously the Association of University Technology Managers) serves as the repository for the original UBMTA Master Agreements and maintains the list of the signatories. Signatories to the UBMTA only have to sign an Implementing Letter with the details of the particular transfer since they have already agreed to all the terms of the Master Agreement.

One Physics Ellipse, College Park, MD 20740, USA Shell Development's Emeryville facilities were located on about , included nearly 90 buildings at its peak, and when decommissioned in 1972, employed a staff of about 1500. Inventions, technical contributions, resources Tricresyl phosphate (TCP) and other gasoline additives were developed at Emeryville. Tar sands extraction and other techniques to increase oil reserves were studied at bench scale and in pilot plants. Shell Development also pioneered de-sulfurization methods and standards for gasoline and motor oil, which were significant in reducing acid rain and other adverse environmental effects of auto exhaust gases. Shell Development scientist Thomas Schatzky also pioneered fingerprinting techniques to identify oil spills' origins. Shell Development Emeryville scientists created the epoxy resins and expanded their applications. In an early dramatization of the new material, Shell Development's team recorded and pressed a musical performance on epoxy resin rather than on vinyl. A classical harpsichordist who was the wife of a scientist performed. Epoxy / carbon fiber and other advanced composites were also pioneered there. Shell polymer scientists revised the scientific community's understanding of polymerization physics for styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), a principal component of most tires since World War II. After natural rubber from rubber trees was made unavailable by the Japanese conquest of Southeast Asia, SBR provided a new material for tires for the Allies' military vehicles. Shell's Charles Wilcoxen later demonstrated the kinetics of the polymerization process, amending the assumptions of the Ziegler-Natta polymerization equations for which a Nobel prize was awarded in 1963. Shell Development also pioneered a class of materials called block copolymers, useful for medical applications such as artificial heart valves. Shell Development had significant capital assets and technical resources, including a cyclotron, an early and long-running electron microscope facility, an elaborate radiation laboratory (whose facilities became Veedercrest Winery), and other then-advanced scientific tools. Shell Development Emeryville made many contributions to the U.S. space program, including development of rocket fuels, and handling techniques and storage methods for these highly explosive compounds. Shell Development's labs also contributed significant support to California-based land speed record holder Craig Breedlove and the Spirit of America vehicles. Corporate culture The American Chemical Society's archives refer to Shell Development as one of a small number of large, pre-eminent private research facilities on the West Coast. Shell scientists served as presidents and other officers of ACS during the decades when the facility was in operation. Though self-identified as a conservative employer, many Shell scientists were politically progressive, championing causes such as the Sierra Club and no-growth economic strategies. Country Joe and the Fish, a '60's anti-war counterculture rock band, dedicated an early album to Martin Dimbat, a Shell Development scientist who contributed funding to their musical venture. Unionized, with a comfortable work pace, elaborate medical benefits for employees, a company-paid lifetime retirement plan and almost-ironclad job security, Shell Development for decades provided the comforts of a socialistic work environment within a corporate giant of capitalism. Because of competitive disadvantages the company would experience if employees could publish freely, Shell Development scientists often experienced the minimal professional recognition compared to scientists in academia. Shell Development's senior scientific ranks included scientists who had been graduate students of Glenn Seaborg, a Berkeley scientist who pioneered techniques to create and verify transuranium elements. Shell Development also bore the indirect imprint of Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Manhattan Project. Manhattan Project alumni worked at Shell / Emeryville, and Oppenheimer himself is asserted to have been an offstage force in unionizing parts of Shell Development's workforce. After Shell Oil dissolved the Shell Development / Emeryville organization and decommissioned its facilities, its employee culture proved robust. For over forty years after Shell Development ceased to exist, employees continued monthly meetings at a marina restaurant nearby. Citing uninterrupted recordkeeping among the surviving employees, a spokesperson reported that somewhat less than half of the known employees from Shell Development were still alive in late 2006. Meetings were finally suspended in 2007. Shell Development's facilities languished briefly following its 1972 departure from its Emeryville campus. The properties then became an early home of biotechnology pioneers Cetus and Chiron. In the 21st century, many of the buildings of the former Shell Development campus are occupied by pharmaceutical giant Novartis.

In 1876 Adoniram Gordon added music to Featherston's poem. Featherston died at the age of 27, well before his poem had become a well-known inspirational hymn. The poem is believed to have been his only publicly published work. Inspiration According to Tim Challies, :Not much is known about Featherston, except that he attended a Methodist church in Montreal, that he was young when he wrote the poem (12 or 16 years old), and that he died at just 27 years of age. One story about how the poem became public is that Featherston mailed it to his aunt in Los Angeles who, upon reading it, quickly sought its publication... It wasn't until several years after Featherston's death that Adoniram Judson Gordon (founder of Gordon College and Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary) added a melody and published it in his book of hymns, thus forever transforming this poem to a song. The United Methodist Church's Hymns of the United Methodist Church, a guide to the denomination's hymnal, states that Featherstone was 16 years old when he wrote the text in 1964. Kenneth Osbeck writes of this hymn in his book, 101 More Hymn Stories: \\"It is difficult to realize that this beloved devotional hymn, which expresses so profoundly a believer's love and gratitude to Christ ... was written by a teenager\\". Notable recordings * Amy Grant recorded a version of the song for her 2002 studio album Legacy... Hymns and Faith that was later included on her 2015 compilation album Be Still and Know...

Overview \\"Now You're Taken\\" is the first song to feature Aidan Moffat on guest vocals for Mogwai; he later wrote lyrics and sang vocals on the song \\"R U Still in 2 It\\" from Mogwai Young Team. It is one of the few early Mogwai songs to feature vocals. It was only performed live a few times in 1997 with Aidan Moffat as a live guest on vocals in Stoke-on- Trent and at the Duchess of York pub in Leeds (amongst other cities). Musical composition The song begins with a guitar playing a quiet harmonic-laden melody, with an additional guitar playing a soft counter melody first audible at (0:13). At (0:27), the main melody of the song begins, being played by guitar and bass: center with a ride cymbal keeping the beat. After repeating the melody, a simple drumbeat enters at (0:51). The melody is repeated, until (2:21), when Aidan Moffat begins singing. A (2:41), (on the line \\"Will he be in the pub tonight?\\"), the drumbeat ends. At (3:34), the drums enter once again, and all the instruments repeat the main melody until (4:42), when the drums stop, and Moffat sings the final lines of the song (\\"Like a bird, a feather bed, my sister says, and we'll get wed/And I should tell you that I adore you, but I'm sure that I'd just bore you\\"). The bass continues to play the main melody, while the guitars play separate counter- melodies. At (6:00) the bass stops playing the melody, leaving the guitars to play the counter-melodies, until (6:51), when the song ends.

The incident and subsequent trial became a cause c√©l√®bre of the Latin- American community and the New Left. All seven were acquitted. Incident The young men‚ÄîGary Lescallett, Rodolfo Antonio (Tony) Martinez, Mario Martinez, Jose Rios, Nelson Rodriguez, Danilo Melendez and George Lopez‚Äîwere approached by plainclothes San Francisco Police Department officers Joe Brodnik and Paul McGoran while the former were moving a stereo or TV into a house at 429-433 Alvarado Street on May 1, 1969 at around 10:30 a.m. A struggle ensued and Brodnik was fatally shot with McGoran's gun. When police descended on the crime scene, they entered the house and assumed the suspects were hiding in the attic. As a police helicopter hovered overhead, they flooded the building with tear gas and sent a fire truck ladder up to the roof to facilitate the search while officer Brodnik's corpse lay untended on the sidewalk. Three days later, six of the youths were arrested for Brodnik's murder, the attempted murder of McGoran, and burglary. The seventh, George Lopez, was never apprehended. They were defended by the activist lawyers Charles Garry and Richard Hodge, lauded by left entities like Ramparts magazine. The young Latinos included four Salvadorans, one Nicaraguan, and one Honduran, some of whom had been involved in the youth group the Mission Rebels (founded in 1965); and later in pan-Latino organizations such as COBRA (Confederation of Brown Race for Action) at the College of San Mateo, and the Brown Berets. Trial The trial began in late June 1970. Court sessions were widely attended by young radicals, including Black Panther Huey P. Newton and two of the Chicago Seven. The prosecution maintained that one of the youths wrested McGoran's gun from him and shot Brodnik. Officer McGoran testified that they approached the youths and lined them up, then he struck one in the face and was jumped by \\"more than one assailant\\". The last thing he remembered hearing was Brodnik shouting, \\"Look out Paul, he's got your gun\\". The defense said McGoran pulled his gun and shot Brodnik during the struggle, and brought forth witnesses to testify to his and Brodnik's excessive use of force in previous incidents. McGoran denied drawing his gun. The defense tried to paint McGoran as a racist and alcoholic who tended to draw his gun during arrests. His estranged wife testified that her husband carried marijuana and other drugs on that he planted on suspects to ensure their convictions. All seven defendants were acquitted. The \\"Los Siete\\" Defense Committee, housed near 24th and South Van Ness, raised support for the seven Mission District youths and obtained assistance from the Black Panther Party. The La Raza Information Center began operating in the summer of 1970 in the vacant storefront next to \\"Los Siete\\". It ran many programs, including Centro de Salud, a free breakfast program, a community newspaper, and its main program, the \\"Los Siete\\" Defense Committee. Notes References * Heins, Marjorie.

Ravindra Bapat and Beg published the theorem in 1989, though they did not offer a proof. A simple proof was offered by Hande in 1994. Often, all elements of the sample are obtained from the same population and thus have the same probability distribution. The Bapat‚ÄìBeg theorem describes the order statistics when each element of the sample is obtained from a different statistical population and therefore has its own probability distribution. Statement Let X_1,X_2,\\\\ldots, X_n be independent real valued random variables with cumulative distribution functions respectively F_1(x),F_2(x),\\\\ldots,F_n(x).

Browning Ross, nicknamed \\"Brownie\\" by his friends, was a lifelong resident of Woodbury in Gloucester County, New Jersey, USA from his birth up until his death (nearly 74 years later to the day). He devoted his life to spreading his love and enthusiasm for long-distance running and is often credited as the cornerstone to the development of long-distance runners in the States today. Early years =High school= Ross did not grow up possessing a love for running. In, fact it was not until he was cut from Woodbury High School's baseball team that he took up running. It was not long before his second choice of sport was a true calling, as Ross blossomed into one of the greatest high school distance runners in the entire state of New Jersey. In the spring of 1943, his senior year, he was crowned the N.J. State Mile Champion and National Interscholastic Indoor Mile Champion. =World War II= Like many teenagers during his generation, Ross graduated from high school and went straight into military service. He joined the Navy and fought in World War II. Upon discharge several years later, he was discovered by Villanova University track coach Jim \\"Jumbo\\" Elliott and awarded a scholarship after a victory in a two-mile race at Madison Square Garden. Villanova University Ross was one of Elliott's first magnificent runners at Villanova during the late 1940s. In 1948 he won the NCAA steeplechase championship, which paved the way for his 1948 U.S. Olympic Team qualification weeks later. International competition =1948 and 1952 Olympics= Ross competed in the 1948 London Olympics where he became the only American to compete in the steeplechase final, placing 7th overall with a 9:23.2 time. Sporting Heroes - 1948 Olympics' Men's 3000m Steeplechase Results, accessed 2007-04-08. After the Olympics were over Ross decided to stay in Europe and postpone his return trip to the United States because he wanted to compete in road races held in Ireland. It was there that he discovered a vast resource of running talent, and when Ross returned home he promptly alerted \\"Jumbo\\" of his findings. Elliott heeded his advice, and thus began Villanova's tradition with its long line of Irish runners. Ross, however, did not match the same success in the 1952 Olympics held in Helsinki, Finland. He qualified to compete but never reached the finals in any competition. =1951 Pan American Games= At the 1951 Pan American Games, Ross placed 1st in the 1500 meter run, shared 1st in the 3000 meter steeplechase, and finished 4th in the 5000 meter run. A controversy occurred in the 3000m steeplechase, where two Americans, Curt Stone and Ross, had pulled away from the field. Stone slowed down on the last straightaway and held Ross's hand as they crossed the line together. Argentine officials debated for two hours whether their actions violated rules requiring athletes to make an effort to win before finally allowing the results to stand, ranking Stone as first after a close examination of the finish photo.Die Zeit: Olympisches Feuer per Flugzeug. Nr. 12, 1951 Long Distance Log With such passion for the sport he loved it was inevitable that Ross would continue to stay involved even after his heyday of running. In 1955 he recognized the need for distance running results to be published and widely distributed in order to increase the public's awareness of the sport. In 1956 he created the Long Distance Log (after its inspiration, Distance Running Journal, created by Austin Scott in 1953)The Long Distance Log: Introduction, Tom Osler, Road Runners Club of America, retrieved 22 April 2010 the only publication devoted exclusively to long-distance running in the USA. The first issues were mimeographed on the backs of recycled high school history tests. The Log would become the major instrument to unite runners and address their concerns over the next 20 years.Long Distance Log beginnings, accessed 22 April 2010 He was the first editor-in-chief of the magazine, which mailed monthly to about 1,000 subscribers throughout the country until 1975. In 1958 Ross founded the Philadelphia Road Runners Club, which later became the national Road Runners Club of America. The club today boasts of more than 180,000 members nationwide. On Jan 27, 1968 Browning Ross (43) ran a 4:45.0 Masters American indoor mile record at the Cornell Invitational.

This was pioneered by Zimmer and Cost from the National Physical Laboratory in the 1960s. It has mainly been used for polymer composite materials. Knowledge of the elastic constants can be used to feed back into models of the material's behaviour or that of the composite manufacturing process used. Immersion technique The ultrasonic immersion method makes use of a temperature stabilised water bath which has a pair of ultrasonic transducers located on either side of the sample which can be rotated using a stepper motor. The time of flight of an ultrasonic pulse that has been transmitted through the material is measured using an electronic timer that determines the start of the transmitted pulse and the start of the received pulse using threshold detection. This timer is typically accurate to microsecond or better resolution. By rotating the sample, time of flight measurements can be obtained a range of angles of incidence, typically up to 40 degrees. From the time of flight, the phase velocity can be determined as a function of the angle of incidence of the ultrasonic pulse. Using Christoffel's equations, the measured data can be fitted using a least squares numeric method to determine six of the nine elastic constants. By slicing the composite material and re-arranging the slices, the method can be re-applied to obtain the remaining three constants not found from the original measurements.

Lincoln grew up in a highly religious Baptist family. He never joined any Church, and was a skeptic as a young man and sometimes ridiculed revivalists. He frequently referred to God and had a deep knowledge of the Bible, often quoting it. Lincoln attended Protestant church services with his wife and children, and after two of them died he became more intensely concerned with religion. Some argue that Lincoln was neither a Christian believer nor a secular freethinker. Although Lincoln never made an unambiguous public profession of Christian belief, several people who knew him personally, such as Chaplain of the Senate Phineas Gurley and Mary Todd Lincoln, claimed that he believed in Christ in the religious sense.Mary T. Lincoln to James Smith, June 8, 1870, in Robert J. Havlik, \\"Abraham Lincoln and the Reverend Dr. James Smith: Lincoln's Presbyterian experience of Springfield,\\" Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society (Autumn, 1999) online quoting Phineas Gurley Noah Brooks to J.A. Reed, December 31, 1872 However, close friends who had known Lincoln for years, such as Ward Hill Lamon and William Herndon, rejected the idea that he was a believing Christian. During his 1846 run for the House of Representatives, in order to dispel accusations concerning his religious beliefs, Lincoln issued a handbill stating that he had \\"never denied the truth of the Scriptures\\". He seemed to believe in an all-powerful God, who shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches. Early years Lincoln's parents were \\"Hard Shell\\" Baptists, joining the Little Pigeon Baptist Church near Lincoln City, Indiana, in 1823 when Abraham was 14 years old. In 1831, Lincoln moved to New Salem, which had no churches. However, historian Mark Noll states that \\"Lincoln never joined a church nor ever made a clear profession of standard Christian belief.\\" Noll quotes Lincoln's friend Jesse Fell: Noll argues Lincoln was turned against organized Christianity by his experiences as a young man witnessing how excessive emotion and bitter sectarian quarrels marked yearly camp meetings and the ministry of traveling preachers. As a young man, Lincoln enjoyed reading the works of deists such as Thomas Paine. He drafted a pamphlet incorporating such ideas but did not publish it. After charges of hostility to Christianity almost cost him a congressional bid, he kept his unorthodox beliefs private.Radicals in Their Own Time Michael Anthony Lawrence - 2010 The one aspect of his parents' Calvinist religion that Lincoln apparently embraced wholeheartedly throughout his life was the \\"doctrine of necessity\\", also known as predestination, determinism, or fatalism. 29 pars. It was almost always through these lenses that Lincoln assessed the meaning of the Civil War. James Adams labeled Lincoln as a deist. It has been reported that in 1834 he wrote a manuscript essay challenging orthodox Christianity modeled on Paine's book The Age of Reason, which a friend supposedly burned to protect him from ridicule. According to biographer Rev. William Barton, Lincoln likely had written an essay something of this character, but it was not likely that it was burned in such a manner. William J. Johnson, New Salem schoolteacher Mentor Graham, with whom Lincoln boarded, reported in 1874 that the manuscript was \\"a defense of universal salvation.\\" The existence of the manuscript influenced by Paine was originally described by Herndon in his biography on Lincoln. Harvey Lee Ross, mail carrier who lived in New Salem with Lincoln in 1834, asserts that this was a fictional story by Herndon. He states the following issues with the original biographer's account. Herndon was 16 years old in 1834 and lived 20 miles away in Springfield and did not have contact with Lincoln. There was no stove in Samuel Hill's store in 1834 where the manuscript was allegedly burned. There was not a copy of The Age of Reason on the bookshelf at the tavern where Herndon said Lincoln had read it. Finally, Ross states he was very well acquainted with everyone in the community of New Salem and he would have known about any conversations regarding a document of this nature.Rufus Rockwell Wilson (1946). Lincoln's First Years In Illinois, The Primavera Press, Inc, NY. pp.51-53. It is a reasonable conclusion that there was never a manuscript written and Paine was not a contributing factor in Lincoln's ideas towards religion. Noll writes, \\"At least early on, Lincoln was probably also a Universalist who believed in the eventual salvation of all people.\\" Lincoln was often perplexed by the attacks on his character by way of his religious choices. In a letter written to Martin M. Morris in 1843, Lincoln wrote: Lincoln in his late 30s as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives (Photo taken by one of Lincoln's law students around 1846) In 1846, when Lincoln ran for Congress against Peter Cartwright, the noted evangelist, Cartwright tried to make Lincoln's religion or lack of it a major issue of the campaign. Responding to accusations that he was an \\"infidel\\", Lincoln defended himself, publishing a hand-bill to \\"directly contradict\\" the charge made against him. The declaration was released as follows: As Carl Sandburg recounts in Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years, Lincoln attended one of Cartwright's revival meetings. At the conclusion of the service, the fiery pulpiteer called for all who intended to go to heaven to rise. Naturally, the response was heartening. Then, he called for all those who wished to go to hell to stand. Unsurprisingly there were not many takers. Lincoln had responded to neither option. Cartwright closed in. \\"Mr. Lincoln, you have not expressed an interest in going to either heaven or hell. May I enquire as to where you do plan to go?\\" Lincoln replied: \\"I did not come here with the idea of being singled out, but since you ask, I will reply with equal candor. I intend to go to Congress.\\" William Herndon, Lincoln's law partner, stated that Lincoln admired deists Thomas Paine and Voltaire. Herndon, an advocate of Darwin's, said Lincoln thought the works of authors like Darwin and Spencer \\"entirely too heavy for an ordinary mind to digest\\" but he read and was \\"interested ... greatly\\" in a book expounding on these ideas, \\"Vestiges of Creation\\", and he was \\"deeply impressed with the notion of the so-called 'universal law' ‚Äî evolution... and he became a warm advocate of the new doctrine.\\" Lincoln believed in God, but some said he doubted the idea that Christ is God. In a written statement to Herndon, James W. Keyes said Lincoln > believed in a Creator of all things, who had neither beginning nor end, who > possessing all power and wisdom, established a principal, in Obedience to > which, Worlds move and are upheld, and animel and vegatable life came into > existence. A reason he gave for his belief was, that in view of the Order > and harmony of nature which all beheld, it would have been More miraculouis > to have Come about by chance, than to have been created and arranged by some > great thinking power. Keyes also added that Lincoln once said > As to the christian theory, that, Christ is God, or equal to the Creator he > said had better be taken for granted ‚Äî for by the test of reason all might > become infidels on that subject, for evidence of Christs divinity Came to us > in somewhat doubtful Shape ‚Äî but that the Sistom of Christianity was an > ingenious one at least ‚Äî and perhaps was Calculated to do good. During the White House years, Lincoln and his family often attended the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church, where the family pew he rented is marked by a plaque. First Inaugural Address The first photographic image of Lincoln as president On Monday, March 4, 1861, Lincoln delivered his first inaugural address, after the oath of office was administered by Chief Justice Roger Taney. Lincoln's speech addressed the national crisis of the southern secession from the union. Lincoln had hoped to resolve the conflict peacefully without a civil war. During the address, Lincoln stated \\"Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him who has never yet forsaken this favored land are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty.\\" Later years In 1862 and 1863, during the most difficult days of the Civil War and his presidency, Lincoln's utterances were sometimes marked with spiritual overtones. =1862: Bereavement and Emancipation= Willie Lincoln, who died in the White House during his father's presidency On Thursday, February 20, 1862, at 5:00 p.m., Lincoln's eleven-year-old son, William Wallace Lincoln (\\"Willie\\"), died at the White House. Historians suggest that this may have been the most difficult personal crisis in Lincoln's life. After the funeral, he attempted a return to his routine but was unable. One week after the funeral, he isolated himself in his office and wept all day. Several people reported that Lincoln told them that his feelings about religion changed at this time. Willie is reported to have often remarked that he wanted to become a minister. When his son died, Lincoln reportedly said, \\"May God live in all. He was too good for this earth. The good Lord has called him home. I know that he is much better off in Heaven.\\" Lincoln quoted by Elizabeth Keckley This transformation is reported by a considerable number of contemporaries, and a number of scholars agree, though there is less agreement on the nature of this change. *Pulitzer prize historian David H. Donald, Lincoln (Simon & Schuster, 1995), p. 336-337, writes: \\"After the burial the President repeatedly shut himself in a room so that he could weep alone... During this time he increasingly turned to religion for solace... During the weeks after Willie's death Lincoln had several long talks with the Rev. Phineas D. Gurley, pastor of the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church in Washington where the Lincolns rented a pew... [W]hen he looked back on the events of this tragic spring, recognized that he underwent what he called 'a process of crystallization' in his religious beliefs.\\" *Ronald White, Lincoln's Greatest Speech (Simon & Schuster, 2002), p. 134, writes, \\"Many have pointed to the death of Willie on February 20, 1862, as a critical moment in Lincoln's struggles with faith.\\" *Stephen Oates, With Malice Toward None: A Life of Abraham Lincoln (Harper & Row, 1977), p. 70, writes, \\"After Willie's death, he talked more frequently about God than he had before.\\" *Sandburg, Abraham Lincoln: The War Years, III:379-380, recounts a report that \\"Mr. Lincoln's views in relation to spiritual things seemed changed from that hour [viz., Willie's death].\\" Spiritualism, popularly in vogue during this era, was tried by Lincoln's wife. She used the services of mediums and spiritualists to try to contact their dead son. Lincoln allegedly attended at least one seance at the White House at this time with his wife. When Bishop Matthew Simpson gave the address at Lincoln's funeral he quoted him asking a soldier \\"Do you ever find yourself talking with the dead? Since Willie's death, I catch myself every day, involuntarily talking with him as if he were with me.\\" At the same time, the war was not going well for the Union. General George McClellan's failure in the Peninsula Campaign came about within months after Willie's death. Next came Robert E. Lee's impressive victory at the Second Battle of Bull Run, after which he said, \\"I have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go.\\"citing Noah Brooks article in Harper's Monthly, July 1865 David H. Donald, Lincoln (Simon & Schuster, 1995), 354, writes, \\"By the summer of 1862, Lincoln felt especially in need of divine help. Everything, it seemed, was going wrong, and his hope for bringing a speedy end to the war was dashed.\\" According to Salmon Chase, as he was preparing to issue the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln said, \\"I made a solemn vow before God, that if General Lee was driven back from Maryland I would crown the result by the declaration of freedom to the slaves.\\" as reported by Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon Portland Chase, September 22, 1862. Others present used the word resolution instead of vow to God. Gideon Welles, Diary of Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy Under Lincoln and Johnson (Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1911), 1:143, reported that Lincoln made a covenant with God that if God would change the tide of the war, Lincoln would change his policy toward slavery. See also Nicholas Parrillo, \\"Lincoln's Calvinist Transformation: Emancipation and War,\\" Civil War History (September 1, 2000). The differences in interpretation of Lincoln's statement may be due to the belief that \\"swearing or vowing\\" to God was considered blasphemous by some religious organizations. At the same time, Lincoln sat down in his office and penned the following words: > The will of God prevails. In great contests each party claims to act in > accordance with the will of God. Both may be, and one must be, wrong. God > cannot be for and against the same thing at the same time. In the present > civil war it is quite possible that God's purpose is something different > from the purpose of either party -- and yet the human instrumentalities, > working just as they do, are of the best adaptation to effect His purpose. I > am almost ready to say that this is probably true -- that God wills this > contest, and wills that it shall not end yet. By his mere great power, on > the minds of the now contestants, He could have either saved or destroyed > the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And, having begun > He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest > proceeds. This concept continued to dominate Lincoln's public remarks for the rest of the war. The same theological allegory was to be prominent in Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address in March 1865: =1863: Gettysburg= In late 1862 and early 1863 Lincoln would endure more agonies. The defeat of General Ambrose Burnside at Fredericksburg followed by the defeat of General Joseph Hooker at Chancellorsville sent Lincoln into a deep depression. \\"If there is a worse place than hell I am in it,\\" Lincoln told Andrew Curtin in December 1862.Carl Sandburg, Abraham Lincoln: The War Years (New York: Harcourt, Brace & Co., 1939), Vol. 1, 630. 1863 was to be the year, however, in which the tide turned in favor of the Union. The Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863 was the first time that Lee was soundly defeated. Prompted by Sarah Josepha Hale, in the fall, Lincoln issued the first Federally mandated Thanksgiving Day to be kept on the last Thursday in November. Reflecting on the successes of the past year, Lincoln said, > No human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these > great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while > dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy. > It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently > and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole > American People. I do therefore invite my fellow citizens in every part of > the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are > sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of > November next, as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father > who dwelleth in the Heavens. In December 1863, Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury decided on a new motto, \\"In God We Trust,\\" to engrave on U.S. coins. Lincoln's involvement in this decision is unclear.According to The Congressional Record (1908, House), p. 3387, the motto was adopted \\"doubtless with his [Lincoln's] knowledge and approval.\\" When a pious minister told Lincoln he \\"hoped the Lord is on our side,\\" the president responded, \\"I am not at all concerned about that.... But it is my constant anxiety and prayer that I and this nation should be on the Lord's side.\\" In November 1863, Lincoln travelled to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to participate in the dedication of the cemetery established there for the thousands of soldiers who died during the recent battle. There he gave his celebrated speech, the Gettysburg Address, wherein he hoped that the nation shall, \\"under God,\\" have a new birth of freedom. The words, \\"under God,\\" may not have been in his written manuscript, but it is posited by some sources that he added them extemporaneously from the podium.William E. Barton, Lincoln at Gettysburg: What He Intended to Say; What He Said; What he was Reported to have Said; What he Wished he had Said (New York: Peter Smith, 1950), pp. 138-139. According to scholars, he may have drawn the expression from George Washington's hagiographer, Parson Weems. =1864= In 1864, some former slaves in Maryland presented Lincoln with a gift of a Bible. According to one report, Lincoln replied: > In regard to this great book, I have but to say, it is the best gift God has > given to man.

All things > most desirable for man's welfare, here and hereafter, are to be found > portrayed in it. The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln (Rutgers University > Press, 1953), Roy P. Basler, editor. Volume, VII, p. 542. In response to the reported speech in Maryland, Lincoln's law partner Herndon remarked \\"I am aware of the fraud committed on Mr. Lincoln in reporting some insane remarks supposed to have been made by him, in 1864, on the presentation of a Bible to him by the colored people of Baltimore. No sane man ever uttered such folly, and no sane man will ever believe it.\\": > Six Historic Americans: Abraham Lincoln\\". > http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/john_remsburg/six_historic_americans/chapter_5.html#3. > Retrieved 2011-01-02.\\" In September 1864, Lincoln, placing the Civil War > squarely within a divine province, wrote in a letter to a member of the > Society of Friends, \\"The purposes of the Almighty are perfect, and must > prevail, though we erring mortals may fail accurately to perceive them in > advance.

Mr. Oldroyd has endeavored to learn for me in what paper he found it and on whose authority it rests, but without result. He does not remember where he found it. It is inherently improbable, and rests on no adequate testimony. It ought to be wholly disregarded. The earliest reference I have found to the story in which Lincoln is alleged to have said to an unnamed Illinois minister, \\"I do love Jesus\\" is in a sermon preached in the Baptist Church of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, April 19, 1865, by Rev. W.W. Whitcomb, which was published in the Oshkosh Northwestern, April 21, 1865, and in 1907 issued in pamphlet form by John E. Burton.See a discussion of this story in They Never Said It, by Paul F.

It could not have been true of him while here, for I have had frequent and intimate conversations with him on the subject of the Bible and the Christian religion, when he could have had no motive to deceive me, and I considered him sound not only on the truth of the Christian religion but on all its fundamental doctrines and teaching. And more than that: in the latter days of his chastened and weary life, after the death of his son Willie, and his visit to the battle-field of Gettysburg, he said, with tears in his eyes, that he had lost confidence in everything but God, and that he now believed his heart was changed, and that he loved the Saviour, and, if he was not deceived in himself, it was his intention soon to make a profession of religion. > > Noah Brooks, a newspaperman, and a friend and biographer of Lincoln's, in > reply to Reed's inquiry if there was any truth to claims that Lincoln was an > \\"infidel\\", stated: > >> In addition to what has appeared from my pen, I will state that I have had many conversations with Mr. Lincoln, which were more or less of a religious character, and while I never tried to draw anything like a statement of his views from him, yet he freely expressed himself to me as having 'a hope of blessed immortality through Jesus Christ.' His views seemed to settle so naturally around that statement, that I considered no other necessary. His language seemed not that of an inquirer, but of one who had a prior settled belief in the fundamental doctrines of the Christian religion. Once or twice, speaking to me of the change which had come upon him, he said, while he could not fix any definite time, yet it was after he came here, and I am very positive that in his own mind he identified it with about the time of Willie's death. He said, too, that after he went to the White House he kept up the habit of daily prayer. Sometimes he said it was only ten words, but those ten words he had. There is no possible reason to suppose that Mr. Lincoln would ever deceive me as to his religious sentiments. In many conversations with him, I absorbed the firm conviction that Mr. Lincoln was at heart a Christian man, believed in the Savior, and was seriously considering the step which would formally connect him with the visible church on earth. Certainly, any suggestion as to Mr. Lincoln's skepticism or Infidelity, to me who knew him intimately from 1862 till the time of his death, is a monstrous fiction -- a shocking perversion.

At one time in his life, he was an elevated Pantheist, doubting the immortality of the soul as the Christian world understands that term. He believed that the soul lost its identity and was immortal as a force. Subsequent to this he rose to the belief of a God, and this is all the change he ever underwent. I speak knowing what I say.

Voirin (the son of a gardener) was born in Paris France, the brother of Joseph Voirin (also a talented bowmaker) and cousin to Jean Baptiste Vuillaume. At age of 12, he served his apprenticeship in Mirecourt, with Jean SIMON, brother of Nicolas SIMON, also known as SIMON FR, and later worked in the workshop of Vuillaume from 1855 to 1870 where he succeeded Nicolas Maline and revolutionized bow design and construction. After his tenure at the Vuillaume shop, he established his own business at 3 rue du Bouloi, Paris, where he worked until his sudden death. He was a prolific maker and is generally regarded as the most important bowmaker of the second half of the 19th century. His bows are of superb quality. Voirin produced a radically different bow from Fran√ßois Tourte; Slimmer head; the camber moved closer to head, yielding a stronger stick and reducing the thickness of the shaft especially at the heel. Primarily, Voirin made bows with the Vuillaume-style frog. The micro-photos of Vuillaume were placed mainly in bows by Voirin using the Stanhope lens. Voirin taught Charles Peccatte (1850‚Äì1920), son of Fran√ßois Peccatte as well as others including Joseph Alfred Lamy also known as Lamy p√®re, Louis and Claude Thomassin, and Charles Nicolas Bazin. Voirin was one of the great makers of the 19th century along with his predecessors Fran√ßois Tourte, Dominique Peccatte, Jean Pierre Marie Persois, and Etienne Pajeot. Though the earlier bows of Voirin were stamped with the Vuillaume brand, his later work bears his own stamp, F.N.Voirin. \\"Fran√ßois Nicolas Voirin has had a lasting effect and influence over many generations of bowmakers. His bows have been used by the greatest soloists, among them Jean-Delphin Alard, Charles Dancla, Eug√®ne Ysa√øe, Mischa Elman, Jacques Thibaud, Isaac Stern, Emanuel Feuermann, Pinchas Zukerman, William Primrose and today Jian Wang and Viktoria Mulova.\\" ‚Äî Gennady Filimonov Quotes \\"Fran√ßois Nicolas Voirin was the most skilled maker of his generation, one of the finest makers ever, and he produced a uniformly high quality product...The best Voirin bows are exquisite playing tools; they are strong and nimble and produce a beautiful tone. By 1880 many makers were beginning to consistently aim for an even heavier, stronger model, with varying degrees of success. Lamy p√®re picked up where Voirin left off.\\" ‚Äî Stefan Hersh 2003  References   * * Les Luthiers Parisiens aux XIX et XX siecles Tom 3 \\"Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume et sa famille - Sylvette Milliot 2006  Fran√ßois Nicolas Voirin, the master of the light violin bow: notes on his life and work * Violins & Bows - Jost Thoene 2006 Category:1833 births Category:1885 deaths Category:People from Paris Category:Bow makers Category:19th-century French people Category:Luthiers Category:Bowed string instrument makers ","title":"Fran√ßois Nicolas Voirin"},{"id":"10545753","text":"McKernan is a neighbourhood located in southwest Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It is named for John McKernan, a prominent businessman in the City of Strathcona whose parents' farm was located there beginning in the late 1870s. \\"Jack\\" McKernan (1870-1918) was the force behind the Princess Theatre, which still stands on Whyte Avenue.Monto, Tom. Old Strathcona Edmonton's Southside Roots, Crang Publishing/Alhambra Books, Edmonton, p. 22 The McKernan-Belgravia LRT station is located in the west portion of the neighbourhood at the northwest corner of 114 Street and 76 Avenue, adjacent to neighbouring Belgravia. The community is near to both the University of Alberta and Old Strathcona. The community is represented by the McKernan Community League, established in 1932, which maintains a community hall and outdoor rink located at 113 Street and 78 Avenue.  History  The land that is now the neighbourhood of McKernan was sparsely settled for many decades, even after the first Euro- Canadians arrived in 1870s. Prior to their arrival, the area held a portion of the \\"hangers-on\\" that settled around Fort Edmonton. Robert McKernan paid $250 for the land that was \\"claimed\\" (by what process it was \\"claimed\\", is not clear at this point) by a frontier (probably Metis) businessman by the name of Emileau.Edmonton Bulletin, April 22, 1882,p. 1, 3 Often his name is mentioned as \\"Emla\\" but that appears to be a mistake. Farms, such as the McKernan's, established in the 1870s were only gradually replaced by houses. The area was annexed by the City of Strathcona, and subdivision and development was proposed. However the 1912-1913 financial collapse ended these plans, and development progressed only in fits and starts until the 1940s brought mass changes. The area encompassed McKernan Lake. This large slough, located south of 76 Avenue, was a popular summertime picnic and boating spot, and in wintertime was the site of many skating parties. From 1913 to 1948, the Edmonton Radial Railway's streetcar, nicknamed the Toonerville Trolley, ran from 82 Avenue south on 110 Street, then along 76 Avenue along the lake to the end of the line at 116 Street.Faulkner, Les. \\"The Toonerville Trolley\\" in The Best of the Strathcona Plain Dealer, Old Strathcona Foundation/Pioneer Press, Edmonton, 1999. p. 79 \\"Development of the area was delayed until McKernan Lake was drained during the 1940s.\\" The bulk of residential construction in McKernan occurred in the first two decades following World War II. Residences in modern McKernan are a mixture of single-family dwellings and duplexes. Infill housing is replacing many of the original houses. Streets are still lined with American elm trees.  Demographics  In the City of Edmonton's 2014 municipal census, McKernan had a population of living in dwellings.  Transportation  McKernan is one of two neighbourhoods served by the McKernan/Belgravia LRT Station. The station was officially opened on April 25, 2009, with regular service commencing on April 26, 2009.  Schools  McKernan School was opened in 1951 and offers both English and French immersion programs from kindergarten to Grade 9. As well, it is the only Edmonton Public school to offer a late French immersion program beginning in Grade 7, and the only Edmonton Public school to offer a Spanish bilingual program from Grade 7 to 9.  Parks  The community features three parks that include playground equipment and open spaces: McKernan Park, with a spray deck installed in 2012; Gowan Park, near McKernan School; and Charles Simmonds Park, which borders Belgravia. A small ‚Äòpocket park‚Äô is located at University Avenue and 112 Street, and is maintained by volunteers from McKernan and South Garneau.  Shopping and services  At the intersection of 76 Avenue and 115 Street, McKernan shares the convenience of a small neighbourhood commercial area with the adjacent Belgravia neighbourhood. This strip consists of three lots with two buildings, and the empty lot has been turned into a garden/green space with numerous large iron sculptures and many local prairie flora. The corner building was built in 1948 of wood construction with stucco exterior, and consisted of two commercial bays on the main floor and three apartments on the second level. Originally, the southernmost bay was home to Rogers' drug store (the Rogers lived on the second floor) and the northernmost bay hosted Pridmore's Meat Shop. When the meat store closed down in the mid-1950s, the drug store took over the rest of the space and operated until 1976. The building was then sold to Monco Holdings Ltd., who has owned the property since then. Since 1976, the building has been home to various businesses including a Beauty Counsellor Franchise, the McPhee Workshop (a sewing and crafts studio), and a used bookseller/antiquariat called Belgravia Books & Treasures, which closed in 2012. In 2005-2006, the building was renovated from a neglected and dilapidated state after three years of vacancy by the current main floor tenants: a locally owned coffee house, Gracious Goods Cafe. The middle building was built in the mid-1950s with a concrete foundation and cinder-block wall construction. It was originally home to Purpur's Groceries, which operated as a full grocery until the Bateman's IGA opened a few blocks down 76 Avenue in McKernan. The store was renamed to Sunlight Foodland and operated as a neighbourhood convenience store until its closure in 2003. The back portion of the building was home to the Beaver Flats Pottery studios. A small commercial strip on 76 Avenue between 112 and 113 Street has hosted an independent pharmacy since the 1950s; it has been operating under the name Maurice Pharmacy since 1970. An Italian restaurant, Enzo's on 76, opened next door in 2013. Another building on the site housed the Bateman's IGA and The Edmonton Bookstore for many years, and was later a site for the Edmonton Catholic Schools' alternative high school program.

Early life He was born near Williamsburg, Kentucky. He attended the public schools, Union College in Barbourville, Kentucky, the University of Kentucky at Lexington, Kentucky and Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. He graduated from the Northern Indiana Normal School and Business Institute (now known as Valparaiso University) in Valparaiso, Indiana and attended the United States Military Academy in 1890 and 1891. Powers studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1894 and commenced practice at Barbourville, Kentucky. He was the superintendent of public schools for Knox County, Kentucky 1894-1899. He was elected secretary of state of Kentucky in 1899 but was unseated after a contest. Assassination of William Goebel Powers was convicted of complicity in the assassination of Governor William Goebel in 1900. The prosecution charged that Powers was the mastermind, having a political opponent killed so that his boss, Governor William S. Taylor, could stay in office. Among his attorneys were R. C. O. Benjamin and Frank S. Black. He was sentenced to prison. An appeals court overturned Powers' conviction, though Powers was tried three more times, resulting in two convictions and a hung jury. Governor Augustus E. Willson pardoned Powers in 1908. Powers had served eight years in jail. While in prison, Powers authored the 1905 book My Own Story. Congress and later life After leaving prison, Powers was elected as a Republican to the 62nd and to the three succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1911 ‚Äì March 3, 1919) but was not a candidate for renomination in 1918. He served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1912 and moved to Washington, D.C., and served as assistant counsel for the United States Shipping Board from 1921 until his death in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1932. He was buried in City Cemetery, Barbourville, Kentucky. Caleb Powers married Laura Rawlings in January 1896 and she died six months later. He was survived by his second wife, Dorothy.

The Mobilio Spike was released in Japan on September 19, 2002 and was Honda's third model in the Small Max series. The Mobilio, according to Honda, attained the highest fuel rating in the 7-passenger vehicle class, at 17.2 km/L. All variants of Mobilio Spike meet domestic fuel efficiency requirements for 2010. It was discontinued in Summer 2008 following the release of the Honda Freed. The Mobilio Spike featured a spacious cargo area that was deep and tall and could be configured in 5 modes; utility mode, long mode, twin mode, refresh mode, and adjustment mode. Along with the flexible cargo configurations, there are two sliding doors, one on each side. Interior tailgate storage hooks can hold about . The VTEC engine is designed for both power and fuel economy. The Japanese Ministry of Transport recognized the Mobilio Spike as an ‚Äúexcellent low emissions‚Äù vehicle. Also featured in all models of the Mobilio Spike is the Honda Multimatic S (CVT). It is Honda's new generation of CVT with 7-speed mode that offers three driving modes: CVT; 7-speed automatic shift mode; and 7-speed manual shift mode. Four-Wheel Drive was also available. The Mobilio Spike incorporates Honda's G-CON (G-force Control) technology, for enhanced crash safety. The vehicle body is designed to offer protection to occupants in a 55 km/h full-frontal collision, a 64 km/h front offset collision, 55 km/h side collision, and a 50 km/h rear collision. Honda has implemented its own vehicle-to-vehicle collision testing program: 50% frontal offset collision with a 2-ton class vehicle while both vehicles traveling at 50 km/h, to help improve safety in real-world collisions. In order to enhance recyclability, almost all interior injection-molded parts are made of olefin resin. Together with other measures, it results in an overall vehicle recyclability of over 90%.

It was a large public works program that included the Works Progress Administration (WPA), Public Works Administration (PWA), the National Youth Administration, the Resettlement Administration, the Rural Electrification Administration, and other assistance programs. These programs were called the \\"second New Deal\\". The programs gave Americans work, for which the government would pay them. The goal was to help unemployment, pull the country out of the Great Depression, and prevent another depression in the future. This was the first and largest system of public-assistance relief programs in American history, and it led to the largest accumulation of national debt.  Background  Before 1935, many programs focused on direct aid and \\"the dole\\". Franklin Delano Roosevelt did not like providing welfare to able workers as it demoralized the unemployed and created dependency on the government, and even the unemployed preferred work relief. He was also concerned about \\"future problems of unemployment and unprotected old age\\" and believed that \\"we have to get it started, or it will never start\\". At the beginning of 1935, 11.3 million Americans were unemployed, which was nearly 22% of the civilian labor force. In January 1935, Roosevelt announced his plans to alter the current relief programs. On April 8, 1935, Roosevelt introduced the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act, which only gave direct aid to people who were unable to work, such as the elderly and the disabled. Despite the word \\"emergency\\", this act was created to address a long-term problem. He asked Congress for $4.88 billion ‚Äì two thirds would go to finance work relief, and the rest would end the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, the work program created by Roosevelt in 1933 which replaced the Civil Works Administration. He asked for $4 billion to get things going, and $880 million was reallocated from previous appropriations to aid 3.5 million people. The local governments and agencies had already cared for the 1.5 million unemployable relief recipients (e.g. the ill, the aged, the physically handicapped). Of the funds appropriated by the act, $27 million was approved for the Federal Art Project, the Federal Writers' Project and the Federal Theatre Project under the WPA sponsored Federal Project Number One.  Collapse  By September 1935, the program was failing and looked to some like it might even collapse. There was only $1 billion left, and less than ¬º of the estimated 3.5 million people were employed. There had been many obstacles that led to its downfall, such as: * The bill was delayed in Congress because people demanded that the program pay wages at existing levels * Congressional leaders wanted to allocate the funds to specific categories and agencies, making it difficult to have a smooth transition from the existing program * Conflict between Harry Hopkins and Harold Ickes ‚Äì they argued on whether the program should be public works (expensive projects with less relief labor) or work relief (\\"made work\\")  Results  Roosevelt had hoped that this would end the Depression and create jobs, but it was unsuccessful. He gave the rest of the appropriation to Harry Hopkins, who had created the WPA. Congress contributed to this program throughout the 1930s, but beginning in 1939, funds were reduced. Many programs were discontinued over the years, and in 1943, Congress ended many of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act programs, including WPA and PWA. Unemployment was no longer a major issue because WWII had created thousands of jobs. Many people complained that \\"the programs created 'busy work' for the unemployed at the expense of the nation's more affluent citizens.\\" The Rural Electrification Administration, however, was successful. In 1934, only 11% of American farms had electricity, but that rose to 50% by 1942 and almost 100% by the end of the 1940s. The WPA built and renovated thousands of schools, hospitals, and playgrounds.

Biography Born in Illinois, the son of a Presbyterian minister, this minister prayed that God would raise up more missionaries. John Hyde passed college and became a member of the faculty. Strangely, he resigned and entered into McCormick Theological Seminary. His elder brother Edmund was also in the seminary. Edmund dreamed of being a preacher, so in pursuit of that dream he went to preach in Montana but suddenly died of a fever. John wondered if he would take his brother's place. In his senior year, he asked a fellow student, Mr. Konkle, for his argument supporting missionary work. That night he decided to become a missionary at last. He came to believe that God was calling him to India. He departed to India in 1892 to preach in the Punjab region. On the way, he read a letter from a friend who said he would ask God to fill John with the Holy Spirit. Angry at the suggestion that he did not already have the Spirit, he threw it away. However he then humbled himself and prayed to God for help. As he was partially deaf, he struggled to learn the native languages. Also while in India, he continued to focus his study mostly on Scripture. His mission at first gained few converts and endured persecution, so he began to pray very intensely. From 1899 he began to spend entire nights in prayer to God. In 1904, he began to attend a conference at Sialkot. He formed the Punjab Prayer Union, the members of which set aside half an hour a day to pray for spiritual revival. In 1908 he told the conference his dream that there would be one conversion a day, and a year later over 400 more converts had been made. He came to be called \\"Praying Hyde\\" for his passionate prayers to reach lost souls. In April 1911 he joined evangelist J. Wilbur Chapman in an evangelistic visit to three towns in England, including Shrewsbury, Shropshire. Immediately afterwards he stayed with friends in Wales, where he fell ill. He had been praying intensely when in Shrewsbury, explaining \\"The burden of Shrewsbury was very heavy, but my Saviour's burden took him down to the grave\\".Shrewsbury Local History Project website, article \\"Effective Prayer\\" His heart had moved from its normal position (in the left) to the right. He went home to Northampton, Massachusetts where a malignant brain tumour was discovered, and he died there after an operation, in February 1912, aged 46. His last words were \\"Shout the victory of Jesus Christ!\\" He was buried in his family's plot in Moss Ridge Cemetery in Carthage, Illinois. Through his missionary work in Sialkot, Pakistan, millions of people accepted Jesus Christ, from the seeds of the Gospel which he planted. References * Carr√©, E. G.

He was President of the Hartford (CT) Bird Study Club (now the Hartford Audubon Society) from 1953 to 1955, and remained active in the group after that. He was editor of the scientific journal Bird-Banding (now Journal of Field Ornithology) from 1950 to 1971, and served as Vice-President of the Northeastern Bird-Banding Association (NEBBA) from 1971 to 1973 (now the Association of Field Ornithologists or AFO), which published Bird-Banding and its successor. From 1956 until his death in 1973, he imported and sold mist nets to bird banders from around the world for NEBBA, and served as their Assistant Treasurer, with the proceeds from the net sales supporting their publications. He was also an active bird bander, banding over 35,000 birds in his lifetime, many of them in his own yard, and publishing several papers about his research on birds. After his death, NEBBA established the E. Alexander Bergstrom Memorial Research Award in his honor, to fund research on birds, including banding studies by amateurs similar to the ones Bergstrom did.Tributes to Bergstrom published in Bird-Banding after his death.E. Alexander Bergstrom Memorial Research Award Bergstrom was also a volunteer leader in conservation, on both the local and state level.

Although the service has been known by many names over nine decades, its mission has been consistent: \\"To conserve and enhance the quality, quantity, productivity and biological diversity of the forest and tree resources of Maryland.\\"1995-2006 Maryland Department of Natural Resources  History  When the first colonists arrived in Maryland in the early 1600s, forests covered most of the State. Very little vegetation grew under the age old trees. One of the settlers wrote this description of the area: \\"Fine groves of trees appear, not choked with briers or bushes and undergrowth, but growing at intervals as if planted by the hand of man, so that you can drive a four horse carriage, wherever you choose, through the midst of the trees\\". In the late 19th century, the nation grew concerned about the abuse of its forest resources, and their protection and management became a politically popular issue. Gifford Pinchot, the \\"father of American forestry\\" and one of Theodore Roosevelt's chief advisors, promoted the concept of wise use and sustained yield of forests.Fred W. Besley - Father of Maryland's forests In the year 1900, Pinchot selected sixty-one young men to participate in forestry training and sent them out in groups around the country to collect forest data for twenty-five dollars a month. One of these young men was Fred W. Besley, who six years later would become Maryland's first State Forester and establish one of the first state forestry agencies in the nation. Begun in 1906, Besley's thirty-six year tenure as State Forester helped place Maryland as one of the Nation's leaders in forest conservation. His appointment coincided with the birth of the state forest system in Maryland that was established by the donation of of forest land by the Garrett brothers. Robert Garrett, who was a Baltimore investment banker and philanthropist, would later say of Swallow Falls, \\"My brother and I agreed to donate a State Forest if Maryland would take care of it.\\" As state forester, Besley enforced the nation‚Äôs first Roadside Tree Law. Intended to beautify Maryland‚Äôs highways by encouraging utilities and the State Roads Commission to plant and maintain roadside trees, this 1914 law served as a model across the nation. Later, in the 1930s, Besley had to stave off attempts by the University of Maryland to hire his assistant foresters as professors. Despite his disdain for politics, Besley proved very skillful at keeping his agency afloat in a constantly changing and shifting political arena. The establishment of the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1933 boosted Maryland's forestry substantially. The CCC not only fought fires but also built cabins and other structures on State Forest land and initiated many reforestation projects. In 1942, Besley retired as the state forester with the longest continuous service as state forester in the nation. Maryland's Forestry Conservancy District Act of 1943 was one of the most progressive forestry laws in the nation. The act stated, \\"It is...the policy of the State to encourage economic management and scientific development of its woodlands to maintain, conserve, and improve soil resources of the State to the end that an adequate source of forest products be preserved for the people...\\". In the 1950s and 1960s more and more people began to visit Maryland's forests. The general public, as well as professional foresters, recognized the fact that forests were valuable for reasons other than simply supplying timber. The environmental movement of the 1970s and the 1980s produced a growing awareness of both the benefits and adverse effects of various forest management practices on the ecosystem. Managers began to coordinate their multiple use management practices more effectively with potential environmental, economic, and social impacts. As of 1990 Maryland has 2.7 million acres of forest land, forty percent of the total acreage that makes up the state. Of this total, 2.4 million acres (90 percent) are classified as timberland. Timberland is defined as land growing at least 20 cubic feet (or the equivalent of twenty-four 2\\" x 4\\" x 8' framing studs) of wood on every acre each year with the potential of harvesting it. Examples of areas not classified as timberland include federal and state park land, Christmas tree farms, and forests set aside for scientific study. These figures have remained fairly consistent up through 2014.

It is located in Foxburg, Clarion County, Pennsylvania, United States of America, approximately north of Pittsburgh on a hill rising about 300 feet above the Allegheny River. The course was listed in 2007 as Foxburg Country Club and Golf Course on the National Register of Historic Places. The clubhouse contains the American Golf Hall of Fame. History The course was built by Joseph Mickle Fox. Fox was introduced to golf in 1884 while traveling in Great Britain to play in cricket matches, as a member of the Merion Cricket Club, also known as \\"The Gentlemen of Philadelphia.\\" After participating in a cricket match in Edinburgh, Scotland, Fox visited St. Andrews to see the game of golf being played. Tom Morris Sr., the old bearded pro at St. Andrews took a liking to Fox and taught him the fundamentals of the game, sold him equipment and gutta percha balls to bring back to the United States. Fox was so intrigued by golf, that upon his arrival back to his summer estate in Clarion County, he made an eight-hole course on the nearby Fox Estate. In 1887, due to local enthusiasm for golf, the club decided to build a more spacious golf course and Fox provided the land rent free, for what was to become Foxburg Country Club. The club was established and the golf course was expanded to nine holes in 1888. Historic buildings and objects at the club are the 1912 seasonal home adapted for use as a clubhouse in 1942, a stone well house built about 1890, and nine golf-related stone troughs. The troughs held sand and water that were combined by the golfers into small mounds that were used in place of tees. They were in use until about 1930. The clubhouse was originally designed by the architecture firm of Starrett & van Vleck. It is a three-story Rustic Adirondack style building, with a broad verandah. Note: This includes Many golfers who have played at Foxburg have stated that it is an easy course, but also challenging due to the amount of trees and brush. Foxburg Country Club is a throwback and considered a \\"must play\\" by true lovers of the game of golf if passing through on Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania. The course is approximately five minutes south of the Interstate. American Golf Hall of Fame The Foxburg Country Club is home to the American Golf Hall of Fame. This museum houses an extensive collection of extremely old and valuable golf clubs and artifacts from many different eras (prior to 1900) of the game. The museum is free and located on the top floor of the Foxburg Clubhouse.

The city was retaken by the government on 11 August 2012. By late July 2013, rebels controlled parts of Ariha, while government forces manned three checkpoints inside the town. On 25 May 2014, the al-Nusra Front and the Suqour al-Sham Brigade launched a two- pronged assault on the southern Ariha hills with the objective of seizing two military outposts; the Fanar Restaurant Checkpoint and the Shami Military Installation sit atop two peaks in the area south of the town and control access to the southern neighborhoods of Ariha via two access roads. At 6 in the morning, the al-Nusra Front with support from Suqour al-Sham detonated four SVBIEDs against government infrastructure targets. All four SVBIEDs exploded in the Jabal al-Arbaeen area on the southern outskirts of Ariha. The first SVBIED, driven by Moner Mohammad Abu Salha, a 22-year-old American man from Florida, approached the Fanar Restaurant Checkpoint from the southwest along a dirt road. The 16-ton armored truck completely destroyed the checkpoint and caused it to crumble in on itself, leaving only few survivors to defend it. Over the course of the battle, two more SVBIEDs exploded to the west of Fanar, targeting the Shami Military Complex. The first two SVBIEDs targeted the Commander'‚Äôs building and Shami Checkpoint. One final VBIED targeted the Aram building, however the driver of the VBIED was able to park his vehicle and escape uninjured. The four explosions were followed by a barrage of artillery and gunfire. By the end of the day Jabhat al-Nusra and Suquor al-Sham had seized both the Fanar and Shami Checkpoints in one of the largest coordinated SVBIED attacks since the beginning of 2014. However, on 13 October 2014, it was reported that rebels destroyed a government APC at al- Fanar Checkpoint. On 24 August 2014, rebels captured Ariha.

The Qusayr area is considered of strategic importance because it lies between the capital and the Mediterranean coast, and is close to the Lebanese border. On 19 May 2013, the Syrian Army attempted to retake al-Qusayr. As of May 2013, there were over 25,000 civilians still living in the city. As of the beginning of June 2013, the Syrian Army regained control over 50% of the city, including the strategic al- Qusayr Military Airbase. On 5 June 2013, the Syrian Army finally regained control of al-Qusayr, after a rapid overnight attack, allowing some rebel fighters to flee to the neighbouring village of al-Dabaah.

The school follows a unique Corporate Work Study Model, which allows students to spend one day per week interning with multinational corporations such as McKinsey, Pfizer, American Express, and JPMorgan Chase. Since its opening in 2004, Cristo Rey New York has produced 943 alumni who have gone on to attend elite colleges and universities throughout the world. According to its mission statement, the school's ultimate goal is \\"that our students will graduate from college and become professionals for others, transforming the world for the good of their families and society.\\" History Cristo Rey New York High School was established in 2004 as a collaborative effort between the Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus, the De La Salle Christian Brothers, and the Jesuits. It functions in a low-income area of Manhattan to serve families who cannot afford private school tuition, serving students from under-served elementary and middle schools who may be behind on standardized tests. The co-founders of the school were Fr. Joseph Parkes, a member of the Society of Jesus and President of the school until 2018, and Bill Ford, the Principal of the school until 2019 and nephew of martyr Ita Ford. For his 13 years of involvement with the school, Fr. Parkes received the Catholic Extension Society Spirit of Francis Award in 2017. Cristo Rey New York is the fifth member of the Cristo Rey Network of high schools, the original being Cristo Rey Jesuit High School in Chicago. Presently, there are 37 Cristo Rey schools in the United States, all of which exclusively serve students from low-income families. Other Cristo Rey Schools in the New York Metropolitan area are Cristo Rey Brooklyn and Cristo Rey Newark. The school's building at 112 East 106th St. is part of St. Cecilia's Church and Convent, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Cristo Rey New York High School building - listed on the National Register of Historic Places  General Information  = Tuition and financials = Cristo Rey New York High School boasts the lowest tuition for a private school in Manhattan at $2,000 per year. The actual operating costs for Cristo Rey education total more than $17,000 per student. After financial aid, the average amount paid per student is $1,185, which covers around 10% of their education. About 40% of these operating costs are funded by income earned by students through Corporate Work Study Program jobs, while grants and private donations cover the final 50% of costs. = Demographics = Cristo Rey New York currently serves a 377-person student body that is 75% Hispanic, 20% African American, and 5% other ethnicities. Most of these students have attended underserved elementary and middle schools, and their academic performance entering high school is predominantly below grade level. The average family income of students is $31,015. = Curriculum and academics = The school has three main components to its curriculum: college readiness, college access, and college success. A major focus of Cristo Rey New York is raising standardized test scores and preparing students for a rigorous college education. Cristo Rey New York also ensures that all students have access to college by providing assistance throughout the entire college application process and ensuring that students obtain sufficient financial aid. Cristo Rey New York currently has a 14:1 student to faculty ratio. = Alumni success = Cristo Rey New York High School has produced tremendous results in its 15-year history. Its 98% college enrollment rate is double the national average for low-income students, and its 83% college graduation rate is more than five times the national average for students of the same peer group. Virtually all Cristo Rey New York graduates will become first-generation college students. Cristo Rey New York's 943 alumni attend prestigious colleges and universities including Georgetown, Columbia, Princeton, Brown, Boston College, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, Cornell, NYU, Northwestern, Pomona, Bates, Amherst, University of Virginia, Howard, Colgate, Tufts, Williams and Hamilton. Many alumni go on to pursue advanced degrees in law, medicine, and various Ph.D. programs, and others work at organizations such as Barclays, Booz Allen Hamilton, Voya Financial, and Thomson Reuters.  Corporate Work Study Program  The Corporate Work Study Program is a distinguishing component of all Cristo Rey schools. Students work one day per week in entry- level positions at an assigned company. The goal is for students to acquire job experience and marketable skills, develop a network of business contacts, gain exposure to a wide variety of career opportunities, and improve in their work ethic and self-esteem. Work is considered part of the curriculum; if a student is dismissed from their job, they are considered to have failed that course. According to Father Joseph Parkes, former president of the school, Cristo Rey High School was \\"founded around a work-study program, so that, in effect, the school would function like a temp agency.\\" The students, who are 98% black and Latino, serve as a \\"diversity pipeline\\" for the corporations, while the students' salaries constitute much of the school's operating costs. The students gain \\"a good deal of poise,\\" in addition to clerical skills. Some are offered summer jobs, for which they can earn extra compensation. Each student earns about $6,500 per year through their Corporate Work Study Program job, which goes directly towards their education costs. Currently, students of Cristo Rey New York work at more than 140 corporate partners throughout the New York metropolitan area. These partners include: A breakdown of the various sectors in which CRNYHS students work * American Express * Archdiocese of New York * Brookfield Properties * The Blackstone Group * CBS Global Distribution Group * Citigroup * HarperCollins * ING * JPMorgan Chase * KPMG * Major League Baseball (MLB) * McKinsey & Co. * MetLife * Michael Kors * Morgan Stanley * Mount Sinai Hospitals * New York Supreme Court - Appellate Division * Pfizer * Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) * Sidley Austin LLP * Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP  Extracurricular activities and other programs  Cristo Rey New York has a full-time volunteer program that employs eight college- graduate volunteers who make a two-year commitment to the school. These volunteers help the school in various ways through assistant teaching, fundraising, moderating extra-curricular activities, coaching, and training and chaperoning students for the Corporate Work Study Program. Volunteers live together in apartments provided by the school and are remunerated for ordinary expenses. Clubs sponsored by the school include: Art Club, Black History Month committee, Choir, Dance Team, Drama Club, Lions Unite in a Pride (formally GSA), Minds Over Matter (STEM Club), MIMA (Modern Improvisational Music Appreciation Group), Student Council, Urban Exploration Club, Yearbook Club, and the student leadership programs Big Brothers/Big Sisters and Peer Mentors. Sports sponsored by the school include: cross-country (boys and girls), soccer (boys and girls), volleyball (girls), basketball (boys and girls), softball (girls), and baseball (boys).

Author/lawyer  Roberts has published more than fifty articles and essays in books, scholarly journals, newspapers, and magazines, including Harvard Law Review, Yale Law Journal, University of Chicago Law Review, Social Text, and The New York Times. She has written Shattered Bonds: The Color of Child Welfare (Basic Civitas Books, 2002) and Killing the Black Body: Race, Reproduction, and the Meaning of Liberty (Pantheon, 1997), in which she purports to give \\"a powerful and authoritative account of the on-going assault‚Äîboth figurative and literal‚Äîwaged by the American government and our society on the reproductive rights of Black women.\\" and was the co-author of casebooks on constitutional law and women and the law. Killing the Black Body received a 1998 Myers Center Award for the Study of Human Rights in North America. Her article, \\"Punishing Drug Addicts Who Have Babies: Women of Color, Equality, and the Right of Privacy\\" (Harvard Law Review, 1991), has been widely cited.https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?cites=10269778360281665532&as;_sdt=2005&sciodt;=0,5&hl;=en Fatal Invention (The New Press, 2011) argues that America is once again on the brink of classifying population by race. She was also a blogger at blackprof.com.  Lecturer/professor  Roberts has delivered several endowed lectures, including the James Thomas Lecture at Yale Law School. She was elected twice by the Rutgers University School of Law graduating class to be faculty graduation speaker, and was voted outstanding first-year course professor by the Northwestern University School of Law class of 2000. She received the Radcliffe University Graduate Society Medal in June 1998. Her current projects concern race and child welfare policy. Roberts has been a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania and Stanford University. In 2002‚Äì03, she was a Fulbright Scholar at the Centre for Gender and Development Studies, University of the West Indies, Trinidad and Tobago, where she conducted research on family planning policy and on gender, sexuality, and HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean. She is currently conducting research on the significance of the spatial concentration of state supervision of children in African American communities and on the use of race in biomedical research and biotechnology. Roberts is featured in the documentary film, Silent Choices, about abortion and reproductive rights from the perspective of African Americans. Roberts also served as an advisor to the film.  Views on torture  Roberts has drawn parallels between what she sees as current U.S. \\"imperialism\\" and white supremacy. She has asserted that U.S. torture of terrorist suspects is a tool to maintain supremacy just as violence has been used to maintain white supremacy, and has compared the treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison to racist lynchings of blacks.  Scholarly contributions  Throughout the years, Roberts has explored topics such as race, reproduction, and motherhood in her scholarship. Additionally, through her writings she has taken her analysis a step further to examine the interconnectivity of these issues, specifically in regards to the experiences of black women. = Fatal Invention = Roberts explores the dangers of the continued research of race in the science and medical fields in her book Fatal Invention. In this book Roberts asserts that genomic science and biotechnology is reinforcing the concept of race as a biological category. She cautions the continued research of race at a molecular level which is being used to hide current racism in the country and continues a racial division by justifying racial differences. Roberts mentions that even after the Human Genome Project proved that race could not be identified in our genes, there is still an interest in race-based genetic variation in medicine. Roberts points out the paradoxical nature of this continued interest as Americans continue to ignore the crushing effects of health disparities and racial inequalities in society. Roberts suggests that when doing research on individuals instead of framing the question as how does it affect different racial groups the question should be framed as how does it affect human beings. At the beginning of the book, Roberts reviews the history of the invention of race. She argues that race is not just a social construct, it is also politically charged and has been disguised as a biological category to justify racial injustice. Roberts writes, ‚Äúthe problem with this interpretation of race as a social construction is that it ignores its political ‚Äì and not biological ‚Äì origin. The very step of creating race, dividing human beings into these categories is a political practice‚Äù. She wants to move beyond race just being a social construction and begins her analysis by explaining the political origins of race and how it was utilized for economic means. The purpose of recounting the history is to emphasize that racial categories are not natural, but that they were created. = Sex Power & Taboo: Gender and HIV in the Caribbean and Beyond = Roberts along with Rhoda Reddock, Sandra Reid and Dianna Douglass study the outbreak of HIV in the Caribbean in Sex, Power, And Taboo: Gender and HIV in the Caribbean and Beyond. Using an interdisciplinary view, the authors research how different factors like gender, norms, and power affect HIV. Gender is emphasized in order to better understand the outbreak of HIV because the authors believe gender impacts sexuality. Roberts, Reddock, Reid and Douglass argue that by looking at HIV through these different lens people will be able to create programs to end the spread of HIV. Sexuality and gender is also explored in order to be used to end HIV and AIDS epidemic through academics, public health and policy professions. Sex, Power and Taboo incorporates the research presented at a conference at the University of the West Indies with the theme of gender, sexuality and HIV. The authors for this book come from different parts of the world and from different types of academic fields. The authors in this book attempts to shape gender and sexuality in the Caribbean in a different view from the perspective of the Global North. = \\"The Problem with Race Based Testing\\" TedX talk = Roberts gives a TEDx talk titled \\"The Problem with Race Based Medicine\\" which was posted online on February 2016. In this TEDx talk Roberts addresses the practice of race based medicine and finds it hurtful to patients. Roberts uses her own observations and talks with medical professionals to conclude that race is used to prescribe, treat, and diagnose patients. The use of race in the medical field is used as a shortcut and as a result can become a distraction by relying on a social construction in order to make biological determinant. Roberts gives an example of a medical test, GFR (glomerular filtration rate), that takes race into account when testing patients. Another problem that Roberts brings up with race medicine is that it relies on bias and stereotypes that can negatively affect patients and cites the example of the stereotype that people of color can handle more pain. This negative stereotype that people of color can handle more pain can lead to patients not receiving the medication they need. Roberts says that race medicine can contribute to social inequality by continuing the racial discrimination. = \\"Racism and the Patriarchy in the Meaning of Motherhood\\" = In her piece \\"Racism and the Patriarchy in the Meaning of Motherhood,\\" Roberts offers insight into the intersecting roles of racism and patriarchy and their deep effects on motherhood for black women in society. Roberts opens the article, broadly discussing an explanation of how women differ in their gendered experiences based on their race, as the intersectional oppression that black women face varies than their white counterparts. She then delves into the impact of racism and the patriarchy, their complex relationship to each other, and argues that racism and patriarchy cannot be separated in their impact on the lives of black women, specifically in regards to how they feel about motherhood and how society perceives black mothers. She explains that there are shared experiences amongst all mothers, but that raising black children in a racist, patriarchal society poses its own pain and struggle. Roberts argues that the social construction of motherhood, which was made by those in power, leads to the stigmatization of mothers who do not fit this mold. Roberts article goes on to outline a brief history of black mothers experience dating back to slavery, through the 19th-century \\"Cult of Domesticity\\", and into modern-day discourse surrounding poverty. Roberts concludes with a call to understand the interplay of racism, sexism, patriarchy, and how ending racism is a necessary step in the feminist fight to end sexism. = \\"Race and the New Reproduction\\" = In her piece \\"Race and the New Reproduction,\\" Dorothy E. Roberts outlines scientific developments regarding reproduction, more specifically focusing on in vitro fertilization or IVF as well as surrogate/contract pregnancies. Roberts notes that many feel that advancements in the field of reproduction work to provide new technologies that are beneficial to those desiring to become parents. Roberts argues that while these new advancements in reproductive technologies offer individuals who are shut out of reproducing without the aid of reproductive technology the opportunity to have children, they still ultimately conform to societal norms that are annexed onto family. Her evidence outlines that the majority of individuals who use and benefit from IVF or other forms of reproductive technologies tend to be heterosexual couples due to social, racial, cultural, economic, as well as legal implications. She argues then that the idea of the nuclear family consisting of a mother, father, and children remains intact due to who is accessing these resources. Roberts uses a feminist perspective to argue that patriarchal norms are invoked with new forms of reproductive technology, as married men strongly benefit from these practices, and that they continue to play into a hierarchy system in the United States that is categorized by race. Roberts finds that IVF is predominately used by white individuals and that legal cases and stories surrounding the mistaken use of sperm or eggs from black donors in IVF treatments are often highly sensationalized in the media. She notes that black individual's lack of access to reproductive technologies is a reflection of issue of their lack of access to healthcare more generally. She additionally notes that sometimes black individual's cultural norms, which stress the importance and significance of familial blood ties, which she argues is linked to a history of slavery and patriarchy, become barriers to accessing these types of technologies. Roberts concludes by noting the serious racial disparities that exist between black and white individuals in their efforts to use these reproductive technologies. = Resources = * * \\"Dorothy Roberts\\" National Coalition for Child Protection Reform * \\"Dorothy Roberts Exposes How Science, Politics and Big Business Are Re-Creating Race Issues From Her Book Fatal Invention\\" Brainstormin' with Bill Frank * IPR People: Dorothy Roberts * Dorothy Roberts: Race, Class, and Care Boston Review * Northwestern News: Child Welfare Discourse Fails to Factor in Racial Bias  References  Category:Writers from Evanston, Illinois Category:Northwestern University faculty Category:American legal scholars Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Yale University alumni Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:African-American lawyers Category:American lawyers Category:University of Pennsylvania Law School faculty ","title":"Dorothy Roberts"},{"id":"10546277","title":"Ministry of Tribal Affairs"},{"id":"10546322","text":"Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., 328 U.S. 680 (1946), is a decision by the US Supreme Court that held that preliminary work activities, if controlled by the employer and performed entirely for the employer's benefit, are properly included as working time under Fair Labor Standards Act.. The decision is known as the \\"portal to portal case.\\" The Supreme Court reaffirmed Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery in its 2016 ruling in Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo, No. 14-1146 (March 22, 2016). Background The United States Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) in 1938. Section 7(a) of the Act defined working time, and required employers to pay overtime wages under certain circumstances. Section 11(c) of the Act requires employers to keep accurate records regarding time on the job. Section 16(b) of the Act enables employees to sue to recover lost wages. About 1,200 workers at the Mt. Clemens Pottery Co. facility in Mount Clemens, Michigan, were employed at a large, facility. The plant was nearly a quarter-mile in length. The employees' entrance was in the northeast corner. Employees were given 14 minutes between each shift to punch the time clock, walk to their respective workbench and prepare for work. It took a minimum of eight minutes for all the employees to get by the time clock. The estimated walking time for employees ranged from 30 seconds to three minutes, but some workers needed as many as eight minutes to reach their workbenches. Upon arriving at their workbench, employees were required to put on aprons or overalls, removed shirts, tape or grease arms, put on finger cots, prepare equipment, turn on switches, open windows, and/or assemble or sharpen tools. Such preparatory activities consumed three to four minutes. Working time was calculated by the employer based on the time cards punched by the clocks. The employer deducted walking and preparatory time from the time cards based on the punched time and assumptions about how long prep work and walking would take on average. Seven employees and their labor union (represented by Edward Lamb) brought a class action suit under Section 16(b) of the FLSA alleging that the employer's calculations did not accurately reflect the time actually worked and that they were deprived of the proper amount of overtime compensation. =Special master's findings= The district court appointed a special master to investigate the case. The special master recommended that the case be dismissed because the employees did not establish by a preponderance of evidence a violation of the Act. The special master concluded that walking time was not traditionally held to be compensable working time in the industry, that the employees had produced no reliable evidence to determine how much time they had lost, and that the employees had not shown that they were forced to wait until starting time. =District court's ruling= The district court agreed, with one exception. The court found that the vast majority of employees were ready for work approximately five minutes before the start of work and that it seemed unreasonable that employees would not begin work as they were paid by piece rate. The court fashioned a formula for computing which employees were forced to wait. The district court then entered a judgment against Mt. Clemens Pottery Co. in the amount of $2,415.74. =Court of appeals' ruling= The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court in part, and overruled the district court in part. The court of appeals upheld the district court and special master by concluding that the employees' claims were not supported by the evidence. However, the court of appeals ruled the district court had erred by assuming that work would begin before the official start of working time. The court of appeals further held that the burden rested upon the employees to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that they did not receive the wages to which they were entitled. The workers appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari. Holding Justice Frank Murphy issued the opinion of the Court.Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone died on April 22, 1946. He had participated in oral argument, but his death precluded participation in a decision. Stone's successor, Fred M. Vinson, would not be confirmed as Chief Justice until June 20, 1946. With Justice Jackson not participating in the case, the final vote for the majority was 5-2. The majority held that the court of appeals and the special master had imposed an improper standard of proof on the employees. Section 11(c) of the Act imposed upon the employer, not the worker, the duty to keep proper records of wages, hours and other conditions and practices of employment. Where the employer has failed to keep accurate or adequate records, Justice Murphy argued, the law does not deny recovery on the ground that the employee is unable to prove the precise extent of uncompensated work. Such a ruling, Murphy noted, would create a strong disincentive for employers to keep any records at all and shift the burden back onto the employee. Thus, Murphy concluded that \\"an employee has carried out his burden if he proves that he has in fact performed work for which he was improperly compensated and if he produces sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of just and reasonable inference.\\"Anderson, 328 U.S. at 687. The employer may rebut such claims by producing accurate and adequate records that document the actual work performed. In the absence of such rebutting evidence, the court may award damages to the employee, even though the award is only approximate. Justice Murphy subsequently turned to the facts of the case. On the basis of the factual record, which proved decisive in the case, the court found that work had, in fact, begun and ended at the scheduled hours and that the employees had no basis for a claim in this regard. The court did not find that the time clock evidence was reliable. \\"[Time] clocks do not necessarily record the actual time worked by employees,\\" Murphy wrote.Anderson, 328 U.S. at 690. Since it took eight minutes for an entire shift to punch in, it would be unfair to credit the first worker in line for eight minutes of work, and the time clocks did not show the time at which employees were compelled to be on the premises or at their workbenches. But the majority held that the employer required workers to be on the premises prior and subsequent to the scheduled working hours. Some of this time was clearly spent on work such as preparatory activities such as putting on aprons, sharpening tools and turning on machinery. Murphy dismissed arguments against vagueness in determining the compensatory award by advocating a de minimis approach. Did the district court need to determine, down to the second, how much time was spent working? He thought not: \\"Split-second absurdities are not justified by the actualities of working conditions or by the policy of the Fair Labor Standards Act.\\"Anderson, 328 U.S. at 692. Murphy reasoned, however, that the evidence clearly showed that workers did spend a \\"substantial measure\\" of time engaged in prep work. This time could be gauged under a de minimis rule, and a satisfactory award fashioned. The majority remanded the case to the district court and ordered that the court determine how much time (on average) was spent walking and how much time doing preparatory activities and to fashion an award based only the amount of time engaged in preparatory activity. =Dissent= Justice Harold Hitz Burton dissented, joined by Justice Felix Frankfurter. Justice Burton argued that Rule 53(e)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure required the court to accept the special master's findings of fact unless clearly erroneous. Burton pointed out that the majority had accepted the special master's findings of fact. How, then, could the court reject the master's findings regarding prep time? Burton also observed that, under the majority's de minimis rule, the employees would receive no award. Burton noted that employees had admitted that as little as one minute was spent in preparatory work. Under the de minimis rule, almost no workers had a claim. Burton also argued that Congress had never intended to redefine the term \\"workweek\\" in the Act. Preparatory work was customarily not paid overtime but included in the rate of pay, Burton said. But the majority's ruling rested in a radical redefinition of the term \\"workweek,\\" Burton claimed. Burton would have affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals. Aftermath In 1947, Congress enacted the Portal to Portal Act of 1947 to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act in light of the court's ruling in Anderson v. Mt Clemens Pottery Co. The word \\"portal\\" refers to the workplace door, so \\"Portal-to-Portal\\" could be interpreted to mean that all time spent within that door is work time. However, Section 4 of the 1947 Act required that the determination of whether time spent in preliminary or postliminary activities was \\"work\\" under the FLSA was to be based solely on contract, custom, or practice. Unfortunately, the Portal-to-Portal Act was equally unclear as to what constituted contract, custom or practice. The Supreme Court attempted to clarify the issue in Steiner v. Mitchell, 350 U.S. 247 (1956), by ruling that activities which were \\"integral\\" to work (such as the donning of protective clothing) were compensable under the FLSA and Portal-to-Portal Act. Nearly 50 years later, the Court again revisited the issue of what constituted \\"work.\\" In IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez,. the Court again engaged in a fact-specific analysis to conclude that time spent waiting while in protective gear, or time spent walking in protective gear, was compensable working time. The Supreme Court reaffirmed Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery in its 2016 ruling in Tyson Foods v. Bouaphakeo, No. 14-1146 (March 22, 2016). Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the 6-to-2 majority, quoted from Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery in affirming the right of pork processing plant workers in using statistics to support their back-wage claims for time spent in donning protective clothing and equipment while at work.

It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 11, 2007. In the episode, frustrated with men, Mrs. Garrison makes the boys write an essay on The Old Man and the Sea. The boys hire Mexican day laborers to do the job for them, but they misinterpret the term \\"essay.\\" Meanwhile, Mrs. Garrison has become a lesbian and finds the bar she hangs out in is about to be taken over by Persian club owners. Mrs. Garrison takes a stand in the name of saving the one place that lets her be the woman she is. The episode is rated TV-MA L, and is a parody of the film 300. Plot When the episode begins, Mrs. Garrison storms into her classroom enraged over a failed date, and takes her anger out on her male students with an essay assignment over the weekend, making them read The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway in its entirety. At Cartman's urging, they hire local Mexican laborers looking for work to read the book and write their essays for them. When they come back for their essays on Monday morning, they find out that the Mexicans misunderstood them, and instead of writing essays they wrote to their √©ses, a slang term in Chicano Spanish for friends. Meanwhile, Mrs. Garrison is working out at Curves when she meets a woman named Allison. Allison invites her to \\"Les Bos\\" (pronounced \\"le-bo\\"), a nearby bar, but Mrs. Garrison is shocked to find out that it's a lesbian bar. After being seduced by Allison, the two engage in scissoring. The next day, when the boys try to explain themselves to Mrs. Garrison about their essay, she happily gives them more time to work, announcing she is a lesbian, which the class is highly supportive of. Garrison returns to Les Bos and becomes sociable with all the women, but then is shocked to discover that the bar is being sold to Persians, who plan to make it into a Club Persh Dance Club. Soon after, the Persians send a representative to see the women at the bar. The representative tries to persuade the women there will be no real change, as the lesbians will still be welcome. Nevertheless, it will no longer be solely a lesbian bar, and will be decorated with stereotypically Persian decorations. Mrs. Garrison kicks the messenger in the testicles in retaliation. After the representative returns to the Persian's club, an army of sixty other Persians prepare to storm the bar, but they fail to defeat the women. The remaining Persians go to see their boss, Rauf Xerxes, who decides to handle the situation personally. Mrs. Garrison decides that the lesbians need a spy inside Club Persh, in order to find illegal activity to use as blackmail, and hires the Mexicans to spy on the Persians. Later, Xerxes arrives, and attempts to reason with Mrs. Garrison, even offering her the job of running the club when he takes control. Mrs. Garrison declines, and tells Xerxes that she knows the Persian leader's secret, found out by the Mexicans ‚Äî Xerxes is actually a woman. Xerxes is shocked that Mrs. Garrison knows her secret, and says this must be kept secret from other Persians. Mrs. Garrison agrees, and in a parallel of her own seduction by Allison, she seduces Xerxes and the two engage in scissoring. Xerxes decides to keep Les Bos a lesbian bar, and is seen at the bar herself. Mrs. Garrison then explains that the school has hired substitutes to take over her class for a while, who turn out to be the same Mexicans again. The boys then decide that the Mexicans are better teachers than Mrs. Garrison. During the math lesson, the Mexicans are explaining how to add fractions, when Kyle remarks, \\"I think I'm actually learning something\\". Reception IGN rated this episode 6.5 passable and said \\"There are some funny moments, as is almost always the case with any episode of this series. When Ms. Garrison first realizes she's a lesbian and tells the class \\"I'm gay!\\" Everyone is a little confused and Stan says \\"Again?\\" The joke about \\"writing essays\\" is a good laugh. Another moment is when \\"Janet\\" Garrison first figures out how two women make love and there's a smash cut to her and her new girlfriend \\"scissoring.\\" It's a shock moment and makes you wonder how they get away with stuff like this. However, when they use the joke again at the end, it's now not nearly as funny. You can't shock the audience twice with the same joke - it just doesn't work that way.\\"South Park: \\"D-Yikes\\" Review - IGN Cultural references The lesbians' fight against the Persians, with Mrs. Garrison kicking the messenger, Rauf Xerxes's physical appearance, and a plethora of slow-motion sequences, are references to the Zack Snyder film 300. The film that is parodied, 300, portrays the defense of the Greek city-states by Spartan warriors at the Battle of Thermopylae. The bar \\"Les Bos\\" can be compared to the Greek island of Lesbos, from which the word Lesbian is derived. It is also a take on the closings of gay bars across the United States.

Hewitt, and starring Scott Brady and Anthony Eisley. It is a remake of The Time Travelers (1964), and was also known as Time Warp. Plot Stanton (Scott Brady) has taken charge of a research company following the death of his father. He warns scientists Mark Manning (Anthony Eisley), \\"Doc\\" Gordon (Abraham Sofaer), and Karen White (Gigi Perreau) that unless they prove that their time travel experiments can produce some results, their funding will be cut off. Desperate, they push their equipment past the level of safety and travel 5000 years into the future. There, they encounter aliens led by Vina (Poup√©e Gamin) who are looking for a planet to colonize. The aliens find no welcome on Earth, which is in the midst of a global war that threatens the human race. She urges them to go back and warn humanity about the danger, then dies in a human attack. The time travelers retreat to their chamber and head back. On the way, they detect another time machine on a collision course. Manning tries to communicate with them; when that fails, they fire at it, but their weapon is too weak. Stanton takes charge, boosts the power and destroys the other vessel. They overshoot the present and end up in the distant past, in the age of dinosaurs. Their giant ruby, a key component of the machine, is destroyed, leaving them stranded. When they explore a nearby cave, they find it studded with all sorts of jewels, including rubies. Overcome by greed, Stanton grabs handfuls of precious gems, returns to the time machine, replaces the ruby and takes off without the scientists. However, on his return trip, he encounters another time travelling machine on a collision course. As he hears a radio broadcast from Manning, Stanton realizes with horror that he is racing towards the earlier version of the time machine. Then he is destroyed by the blast initiated by his earlier self. Meanwhile, as the scientists leave the cave, Gordon stumbles and falls to his death in molten lava. Mark and Karen find the time machine gone; then it mysteriously reappears. They board it and try to return to their present, but arrive the day before their initial departure; as a result, they see their past selves living at a much slower time rate. They hasten back to the time machine to try to fix the problem, but end up hopelessly lost in time and space. In the final scene, the machine, with the two scientists on board, is shown drifting among the stars towards an unknown fate.

She left the group suddenly, only weeks after the group was formed on the first series of the Australian version of Popstars. Career Barry was asked to resign from the girl group Bardot after stealing money from Sophie Monk, but the reason for her departure was not revealed at the time. She first confirmed the circumstances around this event in a 2006 appearance on the TV show Where Are They Now?. In a 2017 Woman‚Äôs Day interview, Barry stated she was paid $1000 to leave the group and to stay silent on the matter at the time, leading to the widespread speculation over her firing, and blamed it on her youth and naivety. She was replaced by Tiffani Wood in the final line-up. After leaving Australia, Barry appeared in independent films and in small roles on the television series Water Rats, General Hospital, Entourage and How I Met Your Mother.

Yitzhak Yedid has been announced as the winner of the 2020 Azrieli Foundation Prize for Jewish Music. His winning composition, Kiddushim Ve‚Äô Killulim (Blessings and Curses), was unanimously declared the best new major work of Jewish music by the judges of the Canadian prize. Yedid received a total prize package valued at over $200,000 CAD, which includes a cash award of $50,000 CAD; a world premiere performance of his work by Le Nouvel Ensemble Moderne; two subsequent international performances; and a recording released on the Analekta label. In 2018 Yedid has won the Sidney Myer Creative Fellowship worth $160,000 over a two-year period. The Sidney Myer Creative Fellowships recognise outstanding talent and exceptional courage. Yedid awarded the top two prizes in Israel for composers and performers: the Prime Minister‚Äôs Prize for Composers (2007) and the Landau Prize for Performing Arts (2009). In 2008 he was awarded the first composition prize for solo work for harp at the 17th International Harp contest which led to numerous performances of the piece worldwide and to two commercial recordings. Yedid has also been awarded a composer-in- residence position at the Judith Wright Arts Centre (Brisbane, 2010) and at the Western Australian Academy of Performing arts (2008). His album Arabic violin Bass Piano Trio was nominated for the 2012 Australian Jazz Bell Awards. Biography Yitzhak Yedid was born on 29 September 1971 in Jerusalem, Israel to a Jewish family of Syrian and Iraqi descent. His initial formative musical experiences included attending liturgical services at his local synagogue where he imbibed the sounds and rhythms of Syrian-style Baqashot. He studied at the Rubin Academy of Music and the New England Conservatory in Boston with Ran Blake and Paul Bley in 1997 and 1998. Yedid lives in Australia. In 2012 he gained a PhD from Monash University in Melbourne and subsequently published Methods of Integrating Elements of Arabic Music and Arabic-Influenced Jewish Music into Contemporary Western Classical Music. Music career Yitzhak Yedid in 2009 In 1999 Yedid released his first album, Compositions for Solo Piano, for the Musa label. This led to an invitation to perform in Scandinavia as the guest of the pianist Michael Smith, and to a joint recital in Sweden with the pianist Roland Pontinen. In 2001, Yedid's second recording, Inner Outcry, was released, also for Musa. Yedid was commissioned to compose the suite Tachanun for the opening of \\"The Third Stream\\" festival in Vienna, Austria, in 2002. This composition has been performed many times in Israel including at the Kfar Blum Chamber Music Festival. Myth of the Cave was commissioned by German record label Between the Lines. It was released in 2002. The five-movement piece has been performed at festivals in Germany and Austria, at the Vancouver International Jazz Festival in Canada and at the Tel Aviv Jazz Festival in Israel. It is based on Plato's allegory of the cave, about cave dwellers imprisoned in near-darkness since birth whose sense of reality is distorted. One of them escapes to the outside world, reports on what he has seen and is put to death for his revelations. In 2003 Yedid composed Passions and Prayers ‚Äì Sextet in homage to Jerusalem for Between the Lines. It is a technically complex and conceptually melancholy composition that premiered at the 2004 Israel Festival. The CD was released in August 2005. Reflections upon Six Images was commissioned for the Third Stream Festival in Vienna Austria in 2004. The music depicts the union and division of images, colours, textures, styles and cultures inspired by the world of the imagination. The composition was performed at the Vienna festival in September 2004 and at the Etnakhta concert series in November 2004 in Israel. The CD was released at the end of 2005. In 2005, Yedid composed the Oud Bass Piano Trio, performed at the Sibiu Festival in Romania, as well as in Australia, Canada, and the US in May and September 2005. In 2002, he joined Israeli jazz saxophonist Abatte Barihun to form the duo Ras Deshen. They recorded their maiden album in September 2002, which featured a blend of Ethiopian music and Free improvisation jazz. Since immigrating to Australia in 2007, his large scale works include: seven string quartets (Visions, Fantasies & Dances), commissioned by Israel's Sapphire String Quartet; Piano Concerto (2016), commissioned by Michael Kieran Harvey and the Tel Aviv Soloists; Kiddushim & Killulim (2017) commissioned by Christian Lindberg & NK Orchestra; Delusions of War (2014) for 22 string soloists or string orchestra, commissioned by Divertimenti Ensemble and the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra; Mandolin Concerto (2016), for mandolin and a large orchestra. Yedid's chamber and solo works include: Chad Gadya (2017), quartet for clarinet, violin, cello & piano, commissioned by Stradbroke Chamber Music Festival; Sensations (2010) for piano, violin and cello, commissioned by Atar Trio; Angles' Revolt (2017) chaconne for solo piano, commissioned by Lev Vlassenko Piano Competition; Out to Infinity (2009) for Harp solo, commissioned by the 2009 International Harp Contest for their 50th Anniversary; The Crying Souls, Lament for Syrian Victims (2013), a cappella choir, commissioned by the Australian Voices (TAV) Yedid has put out over ten albums as a solo act (Challenge Records International, Sony, Naxos, -btl-, Muse, MCI, and Kaleidos) and has collaborated Ethiopian-born saxophonist and vocalist Abate Berihun as the Ras-Deshen ensemble. Yedid's works for strings ‚Äì 'Visions, Fantasies and Dances' for string quartet (2006‚Äì09) and 'Delusions of War' for string orchestra (2014), \\"show sophisticated and idiomatic writing for the strings ‚Äì both individually and as an ensemble. These works are impressive in their scope and colour and variety of instrumental technique. It's also inventive throughout.\\" Yedid's compositions 'Oud Bass Piano Trio' (2006) and 'Arabic Violin Bass Piano Trio' (2008) combine a classical Arabic instrument with Western instruments. Randal McIlroy, Coda Magazine (Canada) wrote \\"Pianist/composer Yitzhak Yedid's Oud Bass Piano Trio conveys terrific tension, aggravation and release. It's a stunner. Minimizing the distinction between composition and improvisation, the music is entrusted to supple hands.\\", and jazz journalist Alain Drouot wrote for the prestigious Downbeat Magazine (US) that \\"Yedid's trio explores a wide range of emotions and tones, even if a dark and mournful mood prevails. The musicians' vivid interpretations produce a positive flow of energy that keeps the music alert and compelling, and Yedid is capable of striking lyricism. Jazz musicians often describe their art as storytelling. Yedid embodies this.\\" Some of Yedid's works have been described as Third Stream, which combines contemporary classical music with jazz improvisation. Much of Yedid's output includes slots where soloists can improvise. Yedid has often said he is delighted when performers surprise him with their inventiveness. Musical style and influences Yedid says his music is influenced by Arabic music. \\"When I was a child I went to the Syrian synagogue, where you hear all the melodies in the Arabic scales. I'm using microtonals in my compositions, and also using the Hassidic and Orthodox Jewish scales. This is all with free jazz and classical music, in equal parts.\\" Yedid's music contains a mix of elements. He says: \\"I'm dealing with very classical things, also with jazz and folk things‚Äîbut it's not classical and it's not jazz and it's not folk. I'm using various techniques, like a painter who's trying to use all the materials he knows about. I'm trying to bring all these different elements together. My music is like a story ‚Äì it's like a film or a play.\\" Yedid writes \\"In Israel, I grew up acutely aware of the tensions caused by the animosity between Palestinians and Israelis. Of profound significance were the sensory images of the shocking terror attack that occurred in a mall in central Jerusalem on December 3, 2001. The destruction and suffering caused by the two suicide bombers was devastating and continues to haunt me to this day. This attack killed eleven innocent boys including my relative 19-year-old Moshe Yedid-Levy. However, in my music, my intention is not to refer directly to experiences such as this but rather to look at Arabic and Jewish matters from a human perspective and in conjunction with philosophical and religious concerns. I am a strong believer in the power of music to bring about understanding, change and reform in societies, and perhaps also between nations. It is my wish to convey the idea of cultural pluralism.\\" And \\"My music presents a philosophy that I believe should also apply in our day-to-day interactions between individuals and between nations and religions. We should acknowledge the past (our tradition and our history) accepting that, no matter what, we are not able to change that which has already occurred but we can try to understand why it occurred. We must also cognizant of the fact that we are the ones who are creating the \\"new tradition\\" and that to this we are able to make changes. My music reflects my passion to create progress and change in composition and in performance of Western classical music; it is a product of what I believe is a natural process of integration over time. I was born in Jerusalem to a family that migrated to Israel from Syria and Iraq early in the 2oth century. At home, we harboured a deep desire to preserve our musical heritage of hundreds of years. However my formal music education was in Western classical music and I have studied and played the piano. I have an intimate connection to my past, to my historical traditions and culture, and to my musical traditions as well as to Western music. Out of these influences, I was able to compose and to propose new compositional approaches to Western classical music. Rabbi Hillel the Elder, the renowned Jewish sage and the principal of the Sanhedrin, an ancient Jewish court of sages, used to say: \\"If I am not for myself who will be for me? Yet, if I am for myself only, what am I? And if not now, when?\\" (Avot 1:14). This quotation from Rabbi Hillel the Elder about the duty of a person to not only be concerned for himself but also to worry and contribute to society reflects my feeling about composing. I believe that one should strive to develop a personal voice and be an individual, not solely for oneself, but also for others, as individuality is a necessary step in any contribution to broader society.\\" Yedid's style of composition has been described as \\"eclectic, multicultural and very personal- a style that combines jazz and Jewish cantor music, classic European and avant-garde, randomness and a blend of techniques.\\" Barry Davis wrote in the Jerusalem Post (2017), \\"Over the past couple of decades or so, Yedid has put out an almost bewilderingly eclectic range of works and recordings. His disciplinary backdrop takes in Western classical music, jazz, free improvisation, Arabic music and liturgical material. His compositions are generally viscerally and cerebrally engaging, and often visually striking, with the piano- playing role requiring a certain amount of calisthenic activity and a significant dosage of emotional and technical investment.\\" Yedid writes \\"Looking for new compositional approaches and challenging musical conventions through the synthesis of a wide spectrum of contemporary and ancient styles is what motivated my work. Intellectual conflicts such as the confrontation with philosophical matters and religious and political aspects have always been of interest, and also underlie and motivated my work. I have been influenced in particular by B√©la Bart√≥k and Arnold Schoenberg to develop a personal vision as a composer.\\" This words by Yedid are inline with what the critics write about his music: John Shand from the Sydney Morning Herald wrote in 2014 about Yedid's Myth of the Cave \\"a vividly expansive composition\\"; Noam Ben-Zeav (Haaretz) wrote in 2013 that \\"Yedid music is an authentic expression of new music which incorporates a wide spectrum of contemporary and ancient styles\\"; and Ake Holmquist (NorraSk√•ne, Sweden) wrote in 2004 that \\"Yedid integrates specific stylistic influences into a personal created unity. The manner in which he describes folkloristic influences and melancholic specific themes can remind of B√©la Bart√≥k; improvisatory float of hovering √† la Keith Jarrett\\". Musically, Yedid creates a confluence between the Maqamat (Arabic music modal system), heterophonic textures of ancient genres, and compositional approaches of contemporary Western classical music, to produce an original sound. Yedid introduces microtonality in his works in a range of different ways. He examined ways of using microtonal pitches that in Arabic music function as ornamentation and as part of improvisational gestures. He has extended the use of traditional ornamentation to compose microtonal sounds with microtonal qualities that unfold at different tempi without a definite pitch. This can be seen in many of his works. In his string quartet Visions, Fantasies and Dances, the microtonal intervals function in the context of diatonic and chromatic intervals and the method of a tension-and-release for intervals of a quarter- tone and three-quarter-tones have been employed. Yitzhak Yedid also writes \\"my work could be viewed as the beginning of my research of integrating classical Arabic music, Arabic-influenced Jewish music and contemporary Western classical music. There are areas that need further exploration in different contexts. These include examining the possibilities in compositions with different types and combinations of instruments. The possibilities drawn in my works should be examined with these instruments and with the new challenges associated with its performance practice. Large ensemble works and the integration of various instrumental combinations of performers from Group A and Group B are other aspects that merit exploration. This includes examining how traditional Arabic instruments can be integrated into Western ensemble as a soloist (perhaps in a concerto format), and also how mixed ensembles of various performers including traditional instruments could be integrated.\\" Yedid have shown a new direction in his later works and courage to make a commentary on international currant political/religious problems that continue to find no resolution. The Crying Souls (commissioned by the Australian Voices) and Delusions of War (commissioned by the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra) are both anti-war works. The Crying Souls was written as a response to the chemical weapons attacks that happened in August 2013 in Damascus when more than 1,300 innocent civilian including children were massacred. Yedid writes \\"This work expresses my endless sadness to the death of innocent people\\". In the notes on Delusions of War he writes \\"The music aims to make the listeners \\"feel\\" the human suffering that the war causes, and, without assuming to have answers, to encourage them to pause for a moment and to envisage better ways than force to resolve crises. The music captures emotions of anger and fear, and feelings of sorrow, tragedy and righteousness.

It is a relative slope-former occurring between the two prominent ridge-forming sandstone units: the Tuscarora Formation and the Bald Eagle Formation in the Appalachian Mountains. Description Conformable contact of overlying Tuscarora Formation (white rock, left) with underlying Juniata Formation (red rock, right) at the Narrows along rt. 30 in Bedford County, Pennsylvania. Sample from roadcut on U.S. Route 322 near State College, Pennsylvania, showing slickensides The Juniata is defined as a grayish-red to greenish-gray, thin- to thick-bedded siltstone, shale, and very fine to medium-grained crossbedded sandstone or subgraywacke and protoquartzite with interbedded conglomerate.Berg, T.M., Edmunds, W.E., Geyer, A.R. and others, compilers, (1980). Geologic Map of Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, Map 1, scale 1:250,000. The Juniata is a lateral equivalent of the Queenston Shale in western Pennsylvania. =Depositional environment= The depositional environment of the Juniata has always been interpreted as mostly terrestrial or shallow marine deposits resulting in a molasse sequence produced by the Taconic orogeny. =Fossils= Very few fossils exist in the Juniata Formation, but different types of trace fossils such as tracks and burrows can commonly be found. Age Relative age dating of the Juniata places it in the Upper Ordovician period, being deposited between 488.3 and 443.7 (¬±10) million years ago. It rests conformably atop the Bald Eagle Formation in Pennsylvania and the Martinsburg Formation in Maryland, and conformably below the Tuscarora Formation.Berg, T.M., et al., (1983).

It and its title song were nominated for a Gospel Music Association (GMA) Dove Award, and claimed an astounding seven airplay hits for the Jesus music stars. Perhaps more importantly it signaled a marked change for the band, both in sound and appearance. It was recorded on the departure of two founding-members, Billy Rush Masters, who wrote the song ‚ÄúFresh Surrender‚Äù and Nancye Short-Tsapralis who had been linchpins in the creation of the group‚Äôs sound and writing team for six years. Now a trio with sister, Janice Archer, who had been traveling with the combo for some time, The Archers took off in a new direction that would define them for the rest of their career. The project was arranged by Elvis Presley's original TCB Band keyboardist, Larry Muhoberac who went on to co-produce The Archers' next album, Stand Up! also released by Light Records. Once again, the band was joined in the studio by an elite group of Los Angeles recording musicians, including Steely Dan alumni Ben Benay, Dean Parks, Lee Ritenour, Wilton Felder, David Hungate, Mike Baird, and Jim Keltner.

In November 1992, Hatsumi Nagasawa and John B. Little first reported this radiobiological phenomenon.  Effect  There is evidence that targeted cytoplasmic irradiation results in mutation in the nucleus of the hit cells. Cells that are not directly hit by an alpha particle, but are in the vicinity of one that is hit, also contribute to the genotoxic response of the cell population. Similarly, when cells are irradiated, and the medium is transferred to unirradiated cells, these unirradiated cells show bystander responses when assayed for clonogenic survival and oncogenic transformation. This is also attributed to the bystander effect.  Demonstration  The demonstration of a bystander effect in 3D human tissues and, more recently, in whole organisms have clear implication of the potential relevance of the non-targeted response to human health.  Consequences  This effect may also contribute to the final biological consequences of exposure to low doses of radiation. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to suggest that the bystander effect promotes carcinogenesis in humans at low doses.  Notes  Note that the bystander effect is not the same as the abscopal effect. The abscopal effect is a phenomenon where the response to radiation is seen in an organ/site distant to the irradiated organ/area, that is, the responding cells are not juxtaposed with the irradiated cells. T-cells and dendritic cells have been implicated to be part of the mechanism. In suicide gene therapy, the \\"bystander effect\\" is the ability of the transfected cells to transfer death signals to neighboring tumor cells.

The Lottery, which began ticket sales on October 12, 2005, is a member of the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL). Players must be 18 or older. History In 2003, the Oklahoma state legislature approved a lottery proposal to go before a vote of the people. Two questions (SQ 705 and SQ 706) were placed on the 2004 general election ballot. Both questions were approved, creating a Lottery Commission and a lottery trust fund. Lottery games =Drawing methods= Originally, Oklahoma Pick 3 and Cash 5 were drawn using traditional drawing machines and numbered balls (which Oklahoma purchased from Missouri after the latter switched to computerized (random number-generated) drawings. When Oklahoma joined Hot Lotto in 2008, that game had already switched to an RNG). On September 20, 2009, Oklahoma changed its two in-house games to RNG drawings. Mega Millions (usually drawn in Georgia) and Powerball (drawn in Florida) have always used traditional lottery machines and numbered balls. =Claiming winnings= Pick 3 and Cash 5 winners must claim prizes within 90 days of the drawing date. Lucky for Life, Mega Millions, Lotto America, and Powerball winners must claim within 180 days of the drawing. =Current in-house drawings= Pick 3 Pick 3, drawn daily, began on November 10, 2005. Players choose three digits 0 through 9, either selected by the player, or selected by the lottery terminal (\\"Easy Pick\\".) Cash 5 Oklahoma Cash 5, initially thrice weekly when begun in 2005, has been drawn nightly since July 2009. =Current multi-jurisdictional drawings= Lucky for Life Lucky for Life began in Connecticut in 2009 as Lucky-4-Life. The game has undergone several changes while it grew from a one-state game, to a regional game, to a quasi-national game with 25 states and the District of Columbia. Players choose 5 \\"white ball\\" numbers from 1 through 48, and a green \\"Lucky Ball\\" from a second set of numbers, 1 through 18. Plays are $2 each. Top prize is $1,000 per day for life, while second prize is $25,000 per year for life; both \\"lifetime\\" tiers have a cash option. There are 10 prize tiers in all. Lotto America Lotto America is drawn Wednesday and Saturday evenings. Lotto America began in October 2017, replacing Hot Lotto. Powerball Powerball began in 1992; it added Oklahoma in 2006. Powerball jackpots begin at $40 million; the game is drawn Wednesday and Saturday evenings at 9:59 p.m. Central Time. Powerball drawings were televised on Fox affiliate KOKH (channel 25) and CW affiliate KOCB (channel 34) in Oklahoma City; and on Cox Communications channel 9 in Tulsa through January 2013. Powerball numbers now are televised via cable superstation WGN America (available on most cable, IPTV and satellite providers in the state; it also carries Mega Millions. Drawings also are available on the Lottery's website. Mega Millions In March 2009, Mega Millions and Powerball began negotiating an agreement to allow each participating U.S. lottery to sell tickets for both games. An agreement was reached on October 13 of that year; two months later, it was announced that Oklahoma would begin selling Mega Millions tickets on January 31, 2010, the cross-selling date. The first Mega Millions drawing with Oklahoma a participant occurred on February 2, 2010.http://www.lottery.ok.gov/press_reader.asp?sourceFile=press_December082009 Mega Millions players choose 5 of 70 \\"white ball\\" numbers, and a gold-colored \\"Mega Ball\\" from a second pool, of 25 numbers. Mega Millions drawings are not televised on any local broadcast television station or local origination cable channel in the Oklahoma City and Tulsa markets; those playing Mega Millions instead see the winning numbers via WGN America on cable and satellite television or on the lottery's website. =Former drawing games= Hot Lotto Pick 4 Pick 4 launched in July 2011. Players were required to choose a set of four digits 0 through 9, either selected by the player, or selected by the lottery terminal. On September 7, 2013, the Lottery announced that it would discontinue Pick 4; its final drawing was seven days later.Oklahoma Lottery to end Pick 4, begin Millionaire Raffle, Tulsa World, September 7, 2013. =Scratchers= The first Oklahoma Lottery tickets were scratch tickets; four such tickets were introduced on October 12, 2005, with price points of $1, $2, and $5. \\"Lucky 7's\\" was among these scratch tickets. =Jackpot winners= In June 2006, the Oklahoma Lottery had its first jackpot winner when an Oklahoman won $101 million in Powerball. The Powerball drawing of June 27, 2007 produced Oklahoma's second winning jackpot ticket for the game, and the largest to date: $105.8 million (annuitized). It was bought in the Sequoyah County town of Roland. Muldrow residents Don and Joyce Harvey (a married couple that at the time were respectively 64 and 50 years old) claimed the prize on June 29, 2007; they chose the cash option, and received approximately $33.7 million after withholdings. July 2, 2008 produced one jackpot winner in Oklahoma for not only Powerball, but also Hot Lotto. It was the first time that the same jurisdiction provided at least one jackpot winner in both games on the same day. The Oklahoma Lottery game show The Lottery produced a game show (simply titled The Oklahoma Lottery Game Show) that was taped in Oklahoma City (and produced by Sande Stewart), which aired on KOCB in Oklahoma City, and Cox Communications cable channel 9 in Tulsa from October 13, 2007 to October 4, 2008. The show, which was hosted by Brad Morris and Amber Dickinson, was introduced to combat lower than expected sales as a result of the Lottery not offering video lottery or keno games. Players on the game show were guaranteed to win $500 each, and could win over $50,000. The second and succeeding shows included a \\"returning champion\\". The program was cancelled due to low ratings; the final episode was taped on August 20, 2008.

Every person or organization could buy Zakavia stocks, and those who owned stocks above a threshold amount could use an airplane built for their money in any way they need unless the airplane was needed for military purposes. In 1925, civil aviation of Georgia and Azerbaijan were merged into the united Zakavia society. In 1926, it started to fly between Mineralnye Vody and Tbilisi via Grozny, Makhachkala, Baku, and Yevlakh. In 1929, Zakavia, together with similar organizations in the Soviet republics, was merged into Dobrolyot USSR, a predecessor of Aeroflot.

He's also served a coach at Tusculum, Davidson, Western Carolina and Northwestern State.Duggar Baucom ‚Äì VMI Bio At the conclusion of the 2017‚Äì18 season, Baucom's career record is 184‚Äì223 in Division I and 37‚Äì19 in Division II. Early life Baucom was born on September 21, 1960, and grew up around Charlotte, North Carolina. He attended North Mecklenburg High School in Huntersville where he played basketball. Following graduation, Baucom took a career in law enforcement and worked as a policeman and North Carolina state trooper.February 10, 2009. \\"Twin Brothers and a High-Octane Offense Revive V.M.I.\\" Adam Himmelsbach. Retrieved July 15, 2014. He was initially assigned to North Mecklenburg as a school resource officer in 1987, and also coached the school's junior varsity basketball team. After four years, he was promoted to varsity head coach.Duggar Baucom ‚Äì VMI Head Coach Baucom's career in law- enforcement was short-lived. On Christmas Day of 1990, Baucom had a heart attack, which was discovered to be a case of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a disease in which heart muscle thickens for no apparent reason. Narrowly avoiding death, Baucom was forced to pursue a low-stress occupation. He enrolled at UNC Charlotte where he earned a B.A. in history and graduated in 1995.2002‚Äì03 Western Carolina Coaching Staff Coaching career Following his time at North Mecklenburg, Baucom first joined the collegiate ranks in 1995 as an assistant to the Davidson Wildcats. In his lone year at Davidson, the Wildcats went 25‚Äì5, 14‚Äì0 in the Southern Conference, and won the league's regular season championship while participating in the National Invitation Tournament. After spending two seasons as an assistant at Division II‚ÄìMars Hill, where he was a scout and recruiting coordinator, Baucom served the same role for one year at Northwestern State in Natchitoches, Louisiana. =Tusculum= Baucom then returned to the Southern Conference where he worked three seasons under head coach Steve Shurina at Western Carolina. His first head coaching job came in 2003 when he was hired by Tusculum College in the Tennessee town of the same name. Baucom immediately made an impression; his first year in 2003‚Äì04, he led the Pioneers to a 19‚Äì8 season en route to a South Atlantic Conference championship. For this, Baucom was named the SAC Coach of the Year. The next season produced similar results, and Tusculum advanced to the regional quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament. The team led their conference in scoring, field goal percentage, free-throw percentage, three-pointers made per game, and assists per game. =VMI= Baucom was then hired in the summer of 2005 by the Virginia Military Institute and athletic director Donny White. The first VMI team under Baucom performed poorly. The Keydets went 7‚Äì20 and 2‚Äì14 in the Big South Conference, failing to qualify for the league tournament. In addition to the struggles on the court, Baucom's heart problems returned, as his previously-installed pacemaker had calcified, rendering it difficult to remove and leading to infections and clotting. It was ultimately replaced with a defibrillator, but Baucom would end up missing twelve games on the season during four months of procedures. Shortly before the start of the 2006‚Äì07 season, the team's troubles continued. Two players were found guilty of committing honor violations and promptly expelled from the school, leaving VMI with no players taller than 6'7. To counter this, Baucom installed a fast-pace, high-scoring offense that was a mixture of the 1980s Loyola Marymount teams and Grinnell College, among others. Dubbed the \\"sprint and strike\\" and \\"loot and shoot\\", by the end of the year, VMI set NCAA records for three-pointers attempted (1,338), three-pointers made (442) and steals (450) that still stand today. The Keydets averaged over 101 points per game and shattered 75 school records.Duggar Baucom ‚Äì VMI Bio The method proved to increase success as well, as the Keydets went 14‚Äì19, the most wins in a season in nine years, and made an upset run through the Big South tournament, defeating Liberty and High Point. They ultimately fell to a 29‚Äì5 Winthrop team that went undefeated in conference play by a score of 83‚Äì80. The following year, VMI went 14‚Äì15 and lost in the conference quarterfinals, which marked the end of forward Reggie Williams' career. Williams led the NCAA in scoring that year and the year prior, and ended his VMI career as the school's all- time leading scorer with 2,556 points. Despite the loss of Williams, 2008‚Äì09 was the most successful year in Baucom's tenure. In the first game of the season, the Keydets upset the Kentucky Wildcats in Rupp Arena, 111‚Äì103. Led by senior twins Chavis and Travis Holmes, the new system was starting to pay dividends, and after a 4‚Äì2 start following a 28-point loss at Jacksonville State, VMI reeled off ten straight wins to go 14‚Äì2 and 6‚Äì0 in league play. The streak was broken at home by Liberty in the first and currently only sellout in Cameron Hall history with 5,029 fans in attendance. After defeating Charleston Southern to move to 20‚Äì3 and 11‚Äì2 in the conference, VMI skidded towards the end of the year with three straight losses, two of which were against weaker opponents. They managed to regroup, ending the season with two wins and advancing to another Big South tournament appearance. However, they were denied their first bid to the NCAA tournament since 1977 again, falling to Radford, 108‚Äì94, ending a 24‚Äì8 season. The 24 victories were the most since that 1977 campaign, and it was only the fourth twenty-win season in program history. The Keydets had a down year in 2009‚Äì10, going 10‚Äì19 and 5‚Äì13 in league play. They still managed to lead the nation in scoring, and did so again the following year. On July 18, 2011, Baucom was signed to a contract extension through the 2015 season. In 2011‚Äì12, VMI clinched its first back-to- back winning seasons since the teams of the late 1970s by going 17‚Äì16. This included yet another surprise run to the Big South tournament final, which was thwarted by UNC Asheville. It was, however, the first year in which VMI did not lead the country in points per game. They failed to do so again in 2012‚Äì13, and had another losing season. Baucom's contract was extended again through the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season (at the same salary) by VMI athletic director Donny White on August 21, 2013. Baucom's 2013‚Äì14 squad became the fifth in school history to have a twenty-win season, going 22‚Äì13 with an 11‚Äì5 Big South record. It was the last season for VMI in the Big South, as they had announced their transition back to the Southern Conference the previous spring. After falling in the conference tournament semifinals, VMI received and accepted an invitation to participate in the 2014 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament. It was the program's first national postseason tournament appearance in thirty-seven years, and the Keydets made the most of their second opportunity. Thanks in large part to the play of senior center D. J. Covington, VMI defeated Canisius, IPFW, and Ohio to advance to the tournament's semifinals.

Computer security incident management is a specialized form of incident management, the primary purpose of which is the development of a well understood and predictable response to damaging events and computer intrusions. Incident management requires a process and a response team which follows this process. This definition of computer security incident management follows the standards and definitions described in the National Incident Management System (NIMS). The incident coordinator manages the response to an emergency security incident. In a Natural Disaster or other event requiring response from Emergency services, the incident coordinator would act as a liaison to the emergency services incident manager.  Overview  Computer security incident management is an administrative function of managing and protecting computer assets, networks and information systems. These systems continue to become more critical to the personal and economic welfare of our society. Organizations (public and private sector groups, associations and enterprises) must understand their responsibilities to the public good and to the welfare of their memberships and stakeholders. This responsibility extends to having a management program for ‚Äúwhat to do, when things go wrong.‚Äù Incident management is a program which defines and implements a process that an organization may adopt to promote its own welfare and the security of the public.  Components of an incident  = Events = An event is an observable change to the normal behavior of a system, environment, process, workflow or person (components). There are three basic types of events: # Normal‚Äîa normal event does not affect critical components or require change controls prior to the implementation of a resolution. Normal events do not require the participation of senior personnel or management notification of the event. # Escalation ‚Äì an escalated event affects critical production systems or requires that implementation of a resolution that must follow a change control process. Escalated events require the participation of senior personnel and stakeholder notification of the event. # Emergency ‚Äì an emergency is an event which may ## impact the health or safety of human beings ## breach primary controls of critical systems ## materially affect component performance or because of impact to component systems prevent activities which protect or may affect the health or safety of individuals ## be deemed an emergency as a matter of policy or by declaration by the available incident coordinator Computer security and information technology personnel must handle emergency events according to well-defined computer security incident response plan. = Incident = An incident is an event attributable to a human root cause. This distinction is particularly important when the event is the product of malicious intent to do harm. An important note: all incidents are events but many events are not incidents. A system or application failure due to age or defect may be an emergency event but a random flaw or failure is not an incident. = Incident response team = The security incident coordinator manages the response process and is responsible for assembling the team. The coordinator will ensure the team includes all the individuals necessary to properly assess the incident and make decisions regarding the proper course of action. The incident team meets regularly to review status reports and to authorize specific remedies. The team should utilize a pre-allocated physical and virtual meeting place. = Incident investigation = The investigation seeks to determine the circumstances of the incident. Every incident will warrant or require an investigation. However, investigation resources like forensic tools, dirty networks, quarantine networks and consultation with law enforcement may be useful for the effective and rapid resolution of an emergency incident.  Process  = Initial incident management process = Author: Michael Berman (tanjstaffl) # Employee, vendor, customer, partner, device or sensor reports event to Help Desk. # Prior to creating the ticket, the help desk may filter the event as a false positive. Otherwise, the help desk system creates a ticket that captures the event, event source, initial event severity and event priority. ## The ticket system creates a unique ID for the event. IT Personnel must use the ticket to capture email, IM and other informal communication. ## Subsequent activities like change control, incident management reports and compliance reports must reference the ticket number. ## In instances where event information is ‚ÄúRestricted Access,‚Äù the ticket must reference the relevant documents in the secure document management system. # The First Level Responder captures additional event data and performs preliminary analysis. In many organizations the volume of events is significant relative to the staff. As a result, automation may be applied, typically in the form of a SOAR (security orchestration, automation and response) tool, integrated with an intelligence API. The SOAR tool automates the investigation via a workflow automation workbook. The cyber intelligence API enables the playbook to automate research related to the ticket (lookup potential phishing URL, suspicious hash, etc.). The First Responder determines criticality of the event. At this level, it is either a Normal or an Escalation event. ## Normal events do not affect critical production systems or require change controls prior to the implementation of a resolution. ## Events that affect critical production systems or require change controls must be escalated. ## Organization management may request an immediate escalation without first level review ‚Äì 2nd tier will create ticket. # The event is ready to resolve. The resource enters the resolution and the problem category into the ticket and submits the ticket for closure. # The ticket owner (employee, vendor, customer or partner) receives the resolution. They determine that the problem is resolved to their satisfaction or escalate the ticket. # The escalation report is updated to show this event and the ticket is assigned a second tier resource to investigate and respond to the event. # The Second Tier resource performs additional analysis and re-evaluates the criticality of the ticket. When necessary, the Second Tier resource is responsible for implementing a change control and notifying IT Management of the event. # Emergency Response: ## Events may follow the escalation chain until it is determined that an emergency response is necessary. ## Top-level organization management may determine that an emergency response is necessary and invoke this process directly. = Emergency response detail = Author: Michael Berman (tanjstaffl) # Emergency response is initiated by escalation of a security event or be direct declaration by the CIO or other executive organization staff. The CIO may assign the incident coordinator, but by default, the coordinator will be the most senior security staff member available at the time of the incident. # The incident coordinator assembles the incident response team. The team meets using a pre-defined conference meeting space. One of the (CIO, CSO or Director IT) must attend each incident team meeting. # The meeting minutes capture the status, actions and resolution(s) for the incident. The incident coordinator reports on the cost, exposure and continuing business risk of the incident. The incident response team determines the next course of action. # Lock-down and Repair ‚Äì Perform the actions necessary to prevent further damage to the organization, repair impacted systems and perform changes to prevent a re-occurrence. # False Positive ‚Äì The incident team determines this issue did not warrant an emergency response. The team provides a written report to senior management and the issue is handled as either a normal incident or it is closed. # Monitor and Capture ‚Äì Perform a thorough investigation with continued monitoring to detect and capture the perpetrator. This process must include notification to the following senior and professional staff: ## CEO and CFO ## Corporate Attorney and Public Relations # Review and analyze log data to determine nature and scope of incident. This step should include utilizing virus, spyware, rootkit and other detection tools to determine necessary mitigation and repair. # Repair systems, eliminate vector(s) of attack, and mitigate exploitable vulnerabilities. # The Test Report documents the validation of the repair process. ## Test systems to ensure compliance with policy and risk mitigation. ## Perform additional repairs to resolve all current vulnerabilities. # Investigate incident to determine source of attack and capture perpetrator. This will require the use of forensics tools, log analysis, clean lab and dirty lab environments and possible communication with Law Enforcement or other outside entities. # The ‚ÄúInvestigation Status Report‚Äù as captures all current information regarding the incident. The Incident response team uses this information to determine the next course of action.

One of the duo's earliest successes, the play helped to establish the trend for tragicomedy that was a powerful influence in early Stuart-era drama. Date and performance While the date of the play's origin cannot be fixed with certainty, Philaster must pre-date 1611, based on its mention by John Davies in his Scourge of Folly. (Davies's book was entered into the Stationers' Register on 8 October 1610, and was printed soon after.) Scholars generally assign the play to the 1608‚Äì10 interval, with \\"the middle to late summer of 1610\\" as perhaps the most likely specific period.Ros King, Cymbeline: Constructions of Britain, London, Ashgate, 2005; pp. 38‚Äì41. The play was acted by the King's Men at both the Globe and Blackfriars theatres, and was performed at court twice in the winter of 1612‚Äì13. Publication The play was first published in 1620 by the bookseller Thomas Walkley, in a seriously defective text; Walkley issued a second quarto two years later (1622), which he termed \\"The second impression, corrected and amended.\\" A third quarto was printed in 1628 by Richard Hawkins, followed by subsequent editions in 1634, 1639, 1652, and 1687; there was also an undated quarto that may date to 1663.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, pp. 222‚Äì3. Scholars have debated the cause of the differences between Q1 and the subsequent editions; the modern critical consensus favours censorship as the most plausible explanation. The villain in the original version of the play (represented by Q2 and later editions) was a Spaniard, the favourite stage villain in English drama at least since the Spanish Armada. King James I, however, favoured a pacifistic foreign policy and improved relations with Spain, so that the play needed to be revised for Court performance, primarily in the opening (I,i) and closing scenes (V,iii- iv, yielding the Q1 version.Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The Later Jacobean and Caroline Dramatists: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1978; p. 57. (Andrew Gurr's modern edition prints the Q1 alterations in an appendix.)Andrew Gurr, ed. Philaster, or Love Lies a-Bleeding. Manchester, Manchester University Press, 2003; pp. 123‚Äì36. Authorship Traditional critics recognised that Beaumont's share in the play is dominant over Fletcher's.E. H. C. Oliphant, The Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher: An Attempt to Determine Their Respective Shares and the Shares of Others, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1927; pp. 201‚Äì7. Cyrus Hoy, in his sweeping examination of the authorship problems in Fletcher's canon, produced this division of authorship in the play: :Beaumont ‚Äî Act I, scene 2; Act II, 1, 3, and 4a (to Pharamond's entrance); Act III; Act IV, 3‚Äì6; Act V, 1, 2, 3a (to King's exit), and 5; :Fletcher ‚Äî Act I, scene 1; Act II, 2 and 4b (from Pharamond's entrance); Act IV, 1 and 2; Act V, 3b (from King's exit) and 4. Adaptations Philaster was revived during the Restoration era in an adapted form, as were many of the plays in the canon of Fletcher and his collaborators; but the 1695 adaptation by Elkanah Settle was not a success. Another adaptation followed, though, by George Colman (printed 1763). The version by George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham (c. 1683; published 1714) was unperformed in his era.Arthur Colby Sprague, Beaumont and Fletcher on the Restoration Stage, Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1926. Synopsis The play is set in a fictionalised version of the Kingdom of Sicily, ruled by an otherwise-unnamed king. This king's father and predecessor, the ruler of Southern Italy (the Kingdom of Naples), had conquered the island of Sicily and displaced the native royal house; but the heir of that house, and rightful king of Sicily, is Philaster, who lives as a nobleman in the royal court. The king fears him, but cannot kill him, because of the passionate loyalty of the people. The king has a plan, however: with no son of his own, he will marry his daughter Arethusa to a Spanish prince named Pharamond, and make the Spaniard his heir. Arethusa, however, is in love with Philaster, and disdains the Spaniard. Philaster reciprocates the princess's affections, and sends his page Bellario to serve her and to be their intermediary. Arethusa is able to frustrate her father's plan by exposing Pharamond's affair with Megra, a loose gentlewoman of the court; but the Spaniard seeks revenge, by spreading reports that Arethusa is having an affair with Bellario. The passionate Philaster is deceived by the slander, and accepts it as true. During a hunt, Philaster confronts Arethusa; the overwrought protagonist stabs the princess (the incident that gives the play its subtitle). Philaster is interrupted by a passing countryman; they fight, and both men are wounded. Philaster crawls off, and Arethusa is discovered by nobles of the court. Arethusa's and Philaster's wounds are not fatal; both recover. Philaster is found, arrested, and sentenced to death. The king places Philaster in Arethusa's custody; she quickly marries him, which causes the king to decree her death as well. The executions are frustrated when the rebellious citizens capture Pharamond and hold him hostage. The falsehood of Pharamond's accusation against Arethusa is exposed when Bellario is revealed to be a disguised female (she is Euphrasia, a courtier's daughter, infatuated with Philaster). Pharamond retreats to Spain. Since the rightful ruler of Sicily is now the king's son and no alternative presents itself, Philaster is restored to his crown. In creating the play, Beaumont and Fletcher were influenced by the works of Sir Philip Sidney, especially the Arcadia.

It inhabits humid lowland forest in small flocks. It is threatened by habitat destruction and limited trapping for the cage-bird trade. Taxonomy The species was formerly considered conspecific with the blue-crowned racket-tail. Description The blue-headed racket-tail is 27‚Äì28 cm long. The plumage is green with a bright, light blue head, blue underwings (except for green coverts) and, in the male, a bluish breast. The beak is bluish gray and iris is yellowish. The species utters a variety of raucous squawks with the occasional musical phrase. Distribution and habitat The species is endemic to the islands of Palawan, Balabac Island, Dumaran Island, Linapacan, Culion, and Busuanga Island. Estimated population size is approximately 2,500-10,000 birds. This corresponds to about 1,500-7,000 mature individuals. It inhabits lowland forest and adjacent cultivated areas, and occasionally scrubland and mangroves, at altitudes of up to at least 300 m.  Ecology  Little is known about this parrot. It is seen in pairs or small flocks, and tends to be very noisy in flight but more silent while feeding. The species feeds on a wide variety of nuts and fruits. It feeds regularly in banana plantation, resulting in some persecution as a pest. Clutch size is unknown. Eggs are about 31.5 x 26 mm in size.  Threats and Conservation  The species is currently classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN, and has been since 1994. While there are no reliable current trend estimates, the presence of a variety of environmental threats make an ongoing population decline very likely. Deforestation is considered the worst threat. On Palawan, deforestation has been rapid due to large mining and logging operations. Mining for chromite on Palawan (and surrounding islands) has contributed majorly to habitat destruction in the area. Illegal logging seems to prevalent in southern Palawan, further putting the blue-headed racket-tail at risk. Capture for the illegal exotic pet trade has a minor impact, as it is usually only captured and sold locally, with very few shipments going out of the Palawan area. Most of the time, the birds die quickly in captivity. The species is present in conservation areas, since the entirety of Palawan is technically a game reserve where hunting is illegal (however this still occurs), and there are populations in several other protected areas.

This is the basic principle of all lasers. Quantitatively, gain is a measure of the ability of a laser medium to increase optical power. Definition The gain can be defined as the derivative of logarithm of power ~P~ as it passes through the medium. The factor by which an input beam is amplified by a medium is called the gain and is represented by G. :G = \\\\frac{{\\\\rm d}z}\\\\ln(P)=\\\\frac{ {\\\\rm d}P /{\\\\rm d} z}{P} where ~z~ is the coordinate in the direction of propagation. This equation neglects the effects of the transversal profile of beam. In the quasi- monochromatic paraxial approximation, the gain can be taken into account with the following equation : 2ik\\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial z}= \\\\Delta_{\\\\perp}E + 2 u E + i G E, where ~ u~ is variation of index of refraction (Which is supposed to be small), ~E~ is complex field, related to the physical electric field ~E_{\\\\rm phys}~ with relation ~E_{\\\\rm phys}={\\\\rm Re}\\\\left( \\\\vec e E \\\\exp(ikz-i\\\\omega t)\\\\right)~, where ~\\\\vec e~ is vector of polarization, ~k~ is wavenumber, ~\\\\omega~ is frequency, ~\\\\Delta_{\\\\rm \\\\perp}=\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial ^2}{\\\\partial x^2}+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial ^2}{\\\\partial y^2} \\\\right) ~ is transversal Laplacian; ~ \\\\rm Re ~ means real part. Gain in quasi two-level system In the simple quasi two-level system, the gain can be expressed in terms of populations ~N_1~ and ~N_2~ of lower and excited states: :~ G = \\\\sigma_{\\\\rm e}N_2 - \\\\sigma_{\\\\rm a}N_1 ~ where ~ \\\\sigma_{\\\\rm e}~ and ~ \\\\sigma_{\\\\rm a}~ are effective emission and absorption cross-sections. In the case of non-pumped medium, the gain is negative. Round-trip gain means gain multiplied by the length of propagation of the laser emission during a single round-trip. In the case of gain varying along the length, the round-trip gain can be expressed with integral g=\\\\int G {\\\\rm d} z . This definition assumes either flat-top profile of the laser beam inside the laser, or some effective gain, averaged across the beam cross-section. The amplification coefficient ~K~ can be defined as ratio of the output power ~ P_{\\\\rm out} to the input power ~P_{\\\\rm in}: :~ K=P_{\\\\rm out}/P_{\\\\rm in}. It is related with gain; ~K=\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\int G {\\\\rm d} z\\\\right)~. The gain and the amplification coefficient should not be confused with the magnification coefficient. The magnification characterizes the scale of enlarging of an image; such enlargement can be realized with passive elements, without gain medium. Alternative terminology and notations There is no established terminology about gain and absorption. Everyone is free to use own notations, and it is not possible to cover all the systems of notations in this article. In radiophysics, gain may mean logarithm of the amplification coefficient. In many articles on laser physics, which do not use the amplification coefficient ~K~ defined above, the gain is called Amplification coefficient, in analogy with Absorption coefficient, which is actually not a coefficient at all; one has to multiply it to the length of propagation (thickness), change the signum, take inverse of the exponential, and only then get the coefficient of attenuation of the sample. Some publications use term increment instead of gain and decrement instead of absorption coefficient to avoid the ambiguity, exploiting the analogy between paraxial propagation of quasi-monochromatic waves and time evolution of a dynamic system.

Calls include harsh chatter at the nest and a sharp \\"tseep!\\" This species nests in colonies or occasionally singly. The nest, often woven in an acacia, is spherical with a short entrance tube opening sideways or downward. Many grass stems project sloppily, sometimes obscuring the shape. It nests in both the short rainy season and the middle of the long rainy season. Typical clutches comprise four eggs, which are unmarked deep blue, somewhat pointed at both ends, 24 to 26 mm long and 15 to 17 mm wide. Speke's weaver is found in northern and eastern Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya (mostly the central highlands), and north-eastern Tanzania. It inhabits savanna, bush, agricultural land, and towns.

This practice has been traced back to pre-Islamic Sasanian Persian Empire. Although Samanu is prominent for \\"Haft-Sin\\" (the seven symbolic items traditionally displayed at Nowruz), the preparation \\"mela\\" and eating it is traditional in Afghanistan. The wheat is soaked and prepared for days and so the entire process takes up to a week. Traditionally, the final cooking would take from evening till the daylight and was a party, mostly involving only women. This would be full of laughter and music and singing related songs. In Afghanistan and Uzbekistan the whole gathering, mostly women, gather near the huge pot: sit in a circle, sing songs, have fun, each of them waits for their turn to stir the sumalak. While stirring the samanak, wishes can be made. Also, whole walnuts are thrown in near the end of the preparation while making a wish. In the morning still warm sumalak is handed out to neighbors, relatives and friends.in Uzbekistan: Feast of the Renewal of Nature, Advantour In Tajikistan and Afghanistan they sing: Samanak dar J≈´sh u mƒÅ Kafcha zanƒìm ‚Äì Dƒ´garƒÅn dar KhwƒÅb u mƒÅ Dafcha zanƒìm.Persian script: in Tajikistan, BBC Persian (meaning: \\"Samanak is boiling and we are stirring it, others are asleep and we are playing daf\\").

The tours are titled to reflect the genre and type of bands playing on them. ShockWaves NME Awards Tours Logo of the 2006 NME Awards Tour. The ShockWaves NME Awards Tours (known without sponsorship as the NME Awards Tour before 1999, and the Brat Bus Tour before 1998) normally takes place in the lead up to the official NME Awards themselves. The tour has been known to sell out in just a matter of hours. The tour normally showcasts the main protagonists of the independent alternative rock scene, with a number of relatively unheard of bands usually supporting more mainstream acts. A number of previous support acts on the tour have gone on to become very successful commercially, such as Arctic Monkeys (support act in 2006) and Franz Ferdinand (who played the opening slot in 2004). Since 2005, the tour has been sponsored by unisex hair product company ShockWaves. In 2007, the main NME Awards tour was split into two different tours of four bands each. The first tour, the ShockWaves NME Indie Rock Tour was created to reflect the growing indie rock scene in Britain throughout 2006-2007. The second tour, the ShockWaves NME Indie Rave Tour, displays the small number of bands currently associated with the new rave music genre. NME editor Conor McNicholas stated that the reason for the tour split was to allow more fans to gain tickets to the Awards tour, and allow them to display more bands at the one time. The tours were played in a number of intertwined dates at the same time. This format was kept for one year, before reverting to one tour in 2008. In 2017, rather than organise a tour themselves, NME sponsored a series of previously announced headline dates by the band Blossoms. In 2018, for the first time in 23 years, an NME sponsored tour did not take place.

The species is endemic to the Central United States and Mexico. Distribution *Northeastern Mexico: Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Tamaulipas. *Midwestern and Southwestern United States: Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. Its current presence is uncertain in Veracruz (Mexico) and Arkansas (United States). Description The yellow mud turtle is a small, olive-colored turtle. Both the common name, yellow mud turtle, and the specific name, flavescens (Latin: yellow), refer to the yellow-colored areas on the throat, head, and sides of the neck. The bottom shell (plastron) is yellow to brown with two hinges, allowing the turtle to close each end separately. The male's tail has a blunt spine on the end, but the female's tail does not. Lifespan The yellow mud turtle can live for more than 40 years. Diet Yellow mud turtles are omnivorous. Their diet includes worms, crayfish, frogs, snails, fish, fairy shrimp, slugs, leeches, tadpoles, and other aquatic insects and invertebrates. They also eat vegetation and dead and decaying matter. Yellow mud turtles forage on land and water for food. In early spring their main diet is fairy shrimp they find in the shallows of their ponds. While they are burrowing, they will eat earthworms or grubs they encounter. Some studies show these turtles will eat earthworms that pass in front of them while hibernating. They also consume fish and other aquatic organisms. Reproduction Most female aquatic turtles excavate a nest in the soil near a water source, deposit their eggs and leave, but yellow mud turtles exhibit a pattern of parental care. They are the only turtle that has been observed that stays with the eggs for any period of time. The female lays a clutch of 1-9 eggs and stays with the eggs for a period of time of a few hours up to 38 days. It is believed that the female stays to keep the predators away from the eggs. It was also observed that the females would urinate on their nests in dry years. This is believed to aid in the hatch success rate of the eggs in dry years. It is believed that in their natural habitat that spring rains induce the turtles to begin nesting. The eggs hatch in the fall and some hatchlings leave the nest and spend the winter in aquatic habitats, but most of the hatchlings burrow below the nest and wait until spring to emerge and then move to the water. This is believed to aid in survival rates of the hatchlings, because some water bodies freeze solid during the winter. Another benefit of waiting to emerge in the spring is that hatchlings enter an environment of increasing resources, such as heat, light, and food. References Further reading *Agassiz L (1857).

The books were published between 1828 and 1830 by A & C Black. In the 19th century, the study of Scottish history focused mainly on cultural traditions and therefore, in Scott‚Äôs books, while the timeline of events is accurate, many anecdotes are either folk stories or inventions.  Composition  In May 1827, Scott came up with the idea of writing the History of Scotland addressed to his six-year-old grandchild, John Hugh Lockhart. The project was partly inspired by the success of John Wilson Croker's Stories for Children Selected from the History of England. The First Series comprised the period between the reign of Macbeth (1033) and the Union of the Crowns (1603) and it was published in December 1827, with the intention of introducing it to the Christmas market. The sales were so high that before the end of the month, Cadell had already ordered a revised and enlarged edition. In May 1828, Scott decided to write a Second Series of Tales. He ended the series on the Union of England and Scotland (1707), which was completed in September 1828 and published two months later. The Third Series, which lead up to the aftermath of the Battle of Culloden (1746), came out in December 1829. In July 1830, he agreed to write a fourth series dealing with French History from Charlemagne to Louis XIV. Published in December 1830, the Fourth Series was as well- received by the public as the earlier Tales.  Reception  The success of the Tales was accompanied by almost unanimous critical approval. In particular, according to the magazine The Athenaeum, the Tales were recognized as an important step towards encouraging writers to write for children. Scott was widely praised for being objective towards different political factions. However, Walter Scott was criticized for drawing insufficiently clear moral lessons from the described events (e.g. by Andrew Bisset in The Westminster Review). The Edinburgh Literary Journal accused Scott of avoiding controversial topics in order to gain popularity. The manuscript of the incomplete Fifth Series of Tales of a Grandfather was published by University of Illinois Press in 1996. Publication First Edition, First Impression: *Scott, Walter, Sir.

Some early coal mining areas are currently inactive, including the Denver Basin and Raton Basin coal fields along the Front Range. There are currently 11 active coal mines, all in western Colorado. History Coal mining in Colorado dates back to 1859, when a pair of men began mining a coal deposit between the gold rush settlements of Denver and Boulder.\\"A tour through the mining district-Arapahoe-incidents on the road-coal mines-Boulder City,\\" Rocky Mountain News, 6 October 1859, p.2. Trenching for coal in Colorado Replica of Coal Miner's Canary in Trinidad, Colorado =Labor struggles= The early history of coal mining in Colorado was one of discontent on the part of miners, and periodic confrontations with the mine operators. The work was dangerous, and Colorado's death rate in the mines was very high. In 1917, 121 people died in the Hastings mine explosion. Erie, Colorado claims the first mining labor union in Colorado, which was the Knights of Labor, Local #771, established in 1878.Town of Erie, A Selected Timeline of Erie's History, http://www.erieco.gov/index.cfm?objectid=DEEF1EB2-D614-E19E-26FD7FC0215D314C retrieved February 21, 2010. The Knights of Labor opposed the creation of the National Federation of Miners and Mine Laborers during the 1880s.Dwight La Vern Smith, The American and Canadian West: a bibliography, ABC-Clio, 1979, page 87 The first strike was called in 1885 by the Knights of Labor. Then in 1886 a regional miners organization was formed, called the Coal Miners' Federation of Northern Colorado. The United Mine Workers (UMW) were defeated by company spies in a strike in the southern field in 1903-04. The UMW called another strike in Colorado's northern coal fields north of Denver in 1910. The strike was inconclusive, but prompted a 10 percent wage increase for ten thousand Colorado miners. The union's real target in Colorado was the larger southern field located south of Pueblo toward Trinidad. A statewide strike called in September 1913 resulted in the Ludlow Massacre.Out Of the Depths, Barron B. Beshoar, 1942 Neutralized by the dispatch of federal troops after ten days of skirmishes provoked by the massacre, the UMW essentially suspended most activities in Colorado for more than a decade. Meanwhile, the organization grew stronger in the east until about 1920, when it collapsed after a national strike. The United Mine Workers were defeated during the 1913-14 strike in Colorado and focused their attention elsewhere. In 1927 Colorado coal miners again laid down their tools, this time under the banner of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Colorado Fuel and Iron, a major conglomerate of steel mills in Pueblo and coal mines around the region, opposed the strike. The company once again hired spies to infiltrate the union. The 1927‚Äì28 strike is best remembered for the Columbine mine massacre. This strike also led directly to Rocky Mountain Fuel Company's decision to unionize the workforce, and President Josephine Roche announced that she would recognize any union affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. In announcing this policy, President Roche avoided recognizing the radical IWW, which had successfully shut down 113 of the state's 125 coal mines.Slaughter in Serene: the Columbine Coal Strike Reader, 2005 Thus, in 1928 the United Mine Workers was awarded its first contract in Colorado. In 1933, legislation enabled unionization throughout Colorado's coal fields. Current production Colorado is the tenth largest coal-producing state in the country. In 2014, Colorado mines produced 21.8 million metric tons (24.0 million short tons) of coal, and employed 2,069 miners. Most Colorado coal is used for electric power generation. Eleven coal mines operate in Colorado, including eight underground mines in Delta, Garfield, Gunnison, La Plata, Rio Blanco, and Routt counties, and three surface mines in Moffat and Montrose counties. All active coal mines are on the western slope, although the New Elk coal mine in Las Animas County is expected to reopen in 4th quarter 2010.\\"New Elk Coal Mine expects production in 2013,\\" Mining Engineering, November 2010, p.44.Cline Mining, New Elk Coal, Colorado, accessed 19 November 2010.

The station is owned by American General Media and broadcasts a country music format. History =KSMA-FM= The station was first signed on in 1960 as KSMA-FM by James M. Hagerman and John I. Groom. It simulcast the full service format of its AM sister station KSMA (1240 AM), airing a mix of news, sports, and middle of the road music. Stereophonic sound broadcasts began in 1970. In January 1980, Hagerman and Nona M. Groom sold KSMA-AM-FM to Bayliss Broadcasting Company for $1.4 million. The company was owned by John Bayliss, who resigned from his position as president of Gannett Company's radio division to manage the Santa Maria stations. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the sale on May 12. =KSNI-FM= Upon the change in ownership, Bayliss ended KSMA-FM's simulcast of KSMA after two decades and programmed it separately as a beautiful music outlet. The FM station changed its call sign to KSNI-FM in August 1980. The format lasted only three years as the station flipped to country music in 1983, adopting the branding \\"Sunny Country\\". On March 1, 1989, the transmitters for KSNI-FM and three other stations in Santa Maria were knocked off the air due to acts of vandalism. Around 1 a.m., two males, ages 18 and 15, broke into the transmitters' circuit breakers and switched them off; the signals were restored within an hour. That same day at 9:14 p.m., the towers fell as guy wires supporting the structures had been severed. Total damage was estimated to be $100,000. In August 1999, Bayliss Broadcasting sold KSNI-FM and KSMA to Fresno-based Mondosphere Broadcasting for $3.75 million. The new owner took possession of the combo on September 30. KSNI-FM changed hands twice in the 2000s. In September 2000, Mondosphere sold 11 stations throughout Central California, including KSNI-FM, plus a construction permit for a twelfth station, to Clear Channel Communications for $45 million. In July 2007, KSNI- FM was one of 16 stations in California and Arizona which Clear Channel sold to El Dorado Broadcasters for $40 million. During the week of January 18, 2010, a storm in the Santa Maria area triggered a power outage that knocked KSNI-FM and several other stations off the air. The station resumed broadcasting under generator power after two hours of silence. From April 2012 to April 2016, KSNI-FM was simulcast on sister station KSLY-FM (96.1 FM) in the adjacent San Luis Obispo market. The two stations co-branded as \\"Sunny Country 102.5 & 96.1\\". In early 2016, El Dorado began selling off its stations on the Central Coast. KSNI-FM and KSMA constituted the first of these divestments as, on February 26, American General Media purchased the pair for $1.5 million. The close of the transaction in April ended the simulcast of Sunny Country on KSLY-FM, which remained with El Dorado and launched a competing country format.

He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1909 to 1913 sitting with the Liberal caucus in government. Business career Prior to his political career Cornwall played a role in the early development of Northern Alberta Cornwall was a founding member of the Northern Transportation Company which grew out of the Northern Traders Company. He served as the company's first President. The company operated fleets of steamboats and barge-towing tugboats on the Mackenzie River system. Political career Cornwall ran as a provincial Liberal candidate in the 1905 Alberta general election in the Peace River electoral district. He faced independent candidate Lucien Dubuc but was defeated by an unknown number of votes despite being favored to win. The election results were annulled by the Executive Council of Alberta as there were significant irregularities in the vote and a new writ was ordered. Cornwall ran in the ensuing by-election held on February 16, 1906. This time he would face Independent Liberal candidate Thomas Brick, who easily defeated him. Cornwall would be returned to the Alberta Legislature by acclimation in the 1909 Alberta general election and hold the seat for a single term as a member sitting with the Liberals. Cornwall would be sued while still a member in the Legislature. On May 13, 1910 he filed his defense in provincial court. Cornwall was named in a lawsuit by Toronto business man Alfred Hawes who was looking to recoup more than $250,000.00 lost in transactions from the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Scandal. The same scandal would cause the resignation of the entire Rutherford cabinet days later. Cornwall would leave the Liberal cabinet and sit as an Independent. At the outbreak of World War I, Cornwall went to fight overseas. While he was over in Europe he would run in the 1917 Alberta general election non-partisan Soldiers' and nurses vote. He ended up finishing fourth in a large field of candidates. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in the 1918 New Year Honours. After the war Cornwall ran in a by-election in the Athabasca district in a 1920 by-election as an Independent. He was easily defeated by Alberta Liberal George Mills. He ran again less than a year later in the 1921 Alberta general election but was defeated finishing in 16th place out of the 26 candidates. The Social Credit government under William Aberhart tried to entice Cornwall to run for a seat in the Legislature under their banner for a by-election in Athabasca, to which Cornwall had declined.

He is the most important student of Nicola Amati and grandfather of one of the best luthiers, Bartolomeo Giuseppe Guarneri, del Ges√π. Biography Thought to be born in 1626 to Bartolomo Guarneri in the parish of Cremona, Italy, very little is known about Andrea Guarneri's family of origin. There are records of a wood-carver by the name of Giovanni Battista Guerine, which may have been an alternative spelling of Guarneri, living near the residence of Nicol√≤ Amati in Cremona in 1632, to whom he may have been related. By 1641 the young Andrea was living with Nicol√≤ Amati and being instructed in the art of violin making, probably working alongside Francesco Ruggieri and Antonio Stradivari who were also an apprentices at the same time. In 1652, while still living in the Amati household, Andrea married Anna Maria Orcelli, daughter of Orazio Orcelli. The young Guarneri family finally left the Amati household in 1654, with Andrea probably removing himself from Amati's workshop and patronage at that time. They moved to the house of Guarneri's father-in-law, the Casa Orcelli, which eventually became the Casa Guarneri. Anna Maria soon bore a daughter, Angela Teresa, followed just over a year later by a son, Pietro Giovanni, who was eventually to carry on his father's violin making. In 1655 we have the first proof that Andrea had definitively left Amati's workshop, in the form of a label in a violin dated 1655, which says \\"ex Allumnis Nicolai Amati\\". In all previous labels \\"Alumnus\\" was written without the prefix \\"ex\\". However, it is thought that even quite some time after both Andrea Guarneri and Francesco Ruggieri left Amati's workshop they occasionally made entire instruments for their former master, which bear the Amati label. By the mid-1660s Andrea and Anna Maria had had two more sons, Eusebio Amati, born in 1658, and Giovanni Battista in 1666. Despite their third son Eusebio's namesake, and probably his god-parent, he was the only son not to follow in his father's footsteps as a violin maker. No further information on Eusebio is available. By evidence in the workmanship of his violins, it is thought that by 1670 or 1675 at least his eldest son Pietro Giovanni (later known as Pietro of Mantua), was making his presence known in the Guarneri workshop. Some of the instruments become lighter, and show a Stradivarian influence. Eventually entire instruments appear to be made by Pietro Giovanni's hand, though they contain the original Andrea Guarneri label. But the cooperation between father and son was short-lived. In 1679, at the age of 24 Pietro's name appears for the last time in the census at his father's house. He soon moved to Mantua and became successful in his own right. However, soon enough Andrea's youngest son joined his father at the workbench. Giuseppe Giovanni Battista is commonly known in the violin trade as Joseph Guarnerius, filius Andre√¶. Probably between the first and third sons were other apprentices and assistants whose identities are lost, though their work is sometimes clearly distinguishable. Andrea himself clearly sought to distinguish between the work of him and his family from that of other workers in his workshop by inserting labels saying Sotto la disciplina (Under the discipline of...). Andrea Guarneri was the first master to make this distinction; the Amatis never did this, though later Stradivari adopted this idea. Some known assistants who were registered in the Guarneri household and later became known luthiers include Giacomo Gennaro (1641-1646) and Paolo Grancino. The exact date of the beginning Giuseppe's apprenticeship is unknown, but evidence of his work begin to be recognizable in Guarneri instruments beginning in 1680, and his influence continued to increase towards the end of his father's career, surpassing that of his father by 1685. Instruments coming out of the Guarneri workshop also continue to show the inspiration of Andrea's eldest son, though he was living in Mantua. Probably the younger looked up to the elder and eagerly copied some of his ideas especially in the form of the outline and cut of the f-holes. The workshop of Andrea Guarneri was one of those who profited from the demand for less expensive instruments that still had the prestigious \\"Cremonese\\" designation. Occasionally, however, specific patronage afforded him the opportunity to rise to a higher level, of which he was quite clearly capable. The surviving examples of the workshop only total about 250 instruments with only four violas and fourteen violoncelli. In his will Andrea Guarneri recorded for posterity the bitterness he felt toward his elder son Pietro for having left the family and moving to Mantua, and for his ingratitude to them even before that. For this he is punished by receiving a reduced inheritance and is called to account for various articles he had taken with him from the family home and workshop. He died on 7 December 1698 in Cremona and was buried in the family crypt of his mother in Basilica di San Domenico. Instruments The earliest Andrea Guarneri violins unsurprisingly closely resembled the Amati style with rounded 'bouts and slender corners whose looser curves end with a slight flat. It appears that he simply continued to use the same moulds that he had in his master's workshop. The arching height is moderate with graceful fluting and the f-holes are quite Amatian, though with the upper eyes tending to be slightly too close together. As the years went on more and more characteristic features of Guarneri's work distinguished themselves. His arching tends toward fullness, and the mitres of his purfling often turning rather abruptly at the corners. The scroll was generally relatively small, without clearly defined chamfers and with shallower volutes than was typical of his teacher. He left the back plate quite thick in the centre, thinning it towards the edges, and the table of consistent thickness, though there seems to be no desire to obtain perfect accuracy in the thickening. The maple used seems to be of local origin and often fairly plain figure. Later in his life the corners become shorter and blunter, edges heavier, and arching more pinched which became somewhat irregularly formed at times with exaggerated fluting. The f-holes tend to stand more upright, cut generously with slightly hollowed wings. The Scrolls when made by Andrea Guarneri were generally neat, but when assisted by Giuseppe Filius, one may notice that they were more youthful not necessarily more finely finished. Throughout his career Guarneri used a high quality oil varnish, the recipe of which was probably learned from his master Nicol√≤ Amati, though evidence of the use of dryers is sometimes apparent specially thus providing a Brescian hue to some of the instruments of Casa Guarneri which was never done by Amati. The color varies from chestnut brown, orange brown, to brown-red. Probably his most famous instrument is the Conte Vitale viola of 1676. It is one of the most copied viola patterns today, though few modern makers chose to copy its distinctively deep fluting. The modeling of the instrument incorporates much that he learned from the Amatis, yet exhibits a characteristic Guarneri robustness. There is a harmony between model, f-hole placement, head and arching that is rarely duplicated. Andrea Guarneri also pioneered a smaller sized violoncello, which evolved over the course of his lifetime from the Amati form and style, though credit may also be due to his acquaintance and competitor, Francesco Ruggieri who made many 'celli in the same period.

The Cobden‚ÄìChevalier Treaty was an Anglo-French free trade agreement signed between Great Britain and France on 23 January 1860. After Britain began free trade policies in 1846, there remained tariffs with France. The 1860 treaty ended tariffs on the main items of trade ‚Äì wine, brandy and silk goods from France, and coal, iron and industrial goods from Britain. The economic effects were small, but the new policy was widely copied across Europe. According to Stephen Krasner, the treaty set off a \\"golden age of free trade\\" in Europe, which was lasted until the late 1870s. It was the first of eight \\"most favored nation\\" treaties the British negotiated in the 1860s. By the 1880s, however, the rise of protectionism in Germany, the United States and elsewhere made the treaty less relevant.John Belchem, and Richard Price, eds. A Dictionary of Nineteenth-Century World History (1994) p 29 It was the first modern trade agreement. It is named after the main British and French originators of the treaty, Richard Cobden MP and Michel Chevalier. Origins and negotiations In a Parliamentary session of 1859, Cobden's friend and political ally John Bright asked why, instead of spending money on armaments against a possible French invasion, did not the Government attempt to persuade French Emperor Napoleon III to trade freely with Britain. Upon reading this speech Chevalier wrote to Cobden and arranged to meet him in England. He discovered that Cobden was planning to visit Paris for family reasons in the winter. Chevalier urged Cobden to meet with the Emperor to try and persuade him of the benefits of free trade. In September, Cobden visited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, William Ewart Gladstone and they both agreed that a commercial treaty between Britain and France was a good idea. After talks with Chevalier and the French Minister of Commerce Eug√®ne Rouher in Paris, Cobden had his first audience with the Emperor on 27 October 1859. They discussed free trade and the Emperor informed him that he could alter tariffs by decree if it were part of an international treaty but that he was worried that free trade would throw French workers out of their jobs. Cobden replied that free trade tended to increase rather than diminish the demand for labour and that because of his tariff reforms Sir Robert Peel came to have great fame and reputation in Britain. The Emperor replied: \\"I am charmed and flattered at the idea of performing a similar work in my country; but it is very difficult in France to make reforms; we make revolutions in France, not reforms\\". On December 9, Chevalier told Cobden that Rouher had drawn up a plan for a commercial treaty which would be submitted for approval from the Emperor the next day. However the Emperor was concerned over the definite advantages France would gain in adopting free trade: Britain was so dependent on trade that she was constantly in fear of war whilst France could endure war with much less inconvenience. Persigny, the French ambassador to Britain, warned the Emperor that war with Britain was a real possibility unless some kind of alliance with Britain was signed, and that with such an alliance in being it did not matter what other European states thought. Rouher presented the Emperor with his commercial plan with sixty pages of favourable arguments, which the Emperor approved. The Emperor announced the treaty in a letter published on 15 January 1860 and it caused fury among the protectionist interests. Princeton University economist Gene Grossman described the treaty as the \\"first modern trade agreement.\\" According to Stephen Krasner, the treaty set off a \\"golden age of free trade\\". Signing On 23 January 1860 at the Foreign Office the plenipotentiaries of both nations signed and sealed the treaty. Lord Cowley, the British Ambassador to France, and Cobden signed on behalf of Britain, and Jules Baroche, the French Foreign Minister, and Rouher for France. However it was then discovered that it had been written in the treaty of English coke and coal rather than British, and harbour when it was meant shipping. The treaty was re-written and signed and sealed on 29 January. Effects The treaty reduced French duties on most British manufactured goods to levels not above 30% and reduced British duties on French wines and brandy. In consequence the value of British exports to France more than doubled in the 1860s and the importation of French wines into Britain also doubled. France ended the treaty in 1892 in favour of the M√©line tariff.

It is a prime example of the Polish Cathedral style of churches in both its opulence and grand scale. A sculpture of Christ the King by famed sculptor Professor Czes≈Çaw D≈∫wigaj, who also cast the monumental bronze doors at St. Hyacinth's Basilica in Chicago stands in front of the church. The church is also well known as the site where Al Capone's sister Mafalda married in 1930. The parish of St. Mary of Czƒôstochowa serves a diverse population. A number of parishioners, still actively involved, lay claim to having parents and grandparents who pioneered the parish. A young Polish immigrant population, although not living in the area, have strong ties to the Black Madonna and call St. Mary of Czƒôstochowa their spiritual home. Just as great numbers of Poles and Germans settled in the Hawthorne neighborhood of Cicero over a hundred years ago, so today large numbers of people from Mexico have settled here, and the Hispanic presence is very much part of the parish. St. Mary of Czƒôstochowa offers mass in Polish, Spanish and English and is currently home to 1,450 families. History The parish of St. Mary of Czƒôstochowa was founded as a Polish parish in 1895, but the Polish community in Hawthorne in Cicero, Illinois dates from the 1880s when the area was still prairie. The Polish settlement in Hawthorne centered around the Dolese & Shepherd lime and stone quarry at 31st and Cicero Avenue. Hawthorne's Polish Catholics walked over five miles to St. Adalbert's at 16th and Allport Streets in Chicago in order to attend Masses in their native tongue. With the formation of St. Casimir Church at 22nd and Whipple Streets in 1890, their trip shortened to three and a half miles, yet they longed for a parish of their own. The only Catholic parish in Cicero was then St. Dionysius, a predominantly German parish at 4852 West 29th Street, established as a mission of Holy Trinity Church in Chicago in 1889. On March 27, 1892, Polish Catholics of Hawthorne met to discuss plans for a parish. By May 1893, the group purchased six lots at 30th Street and Linden (now 49th) Avenue at a cost of $2,250. Subsequently, it sent a delegation to Archbishop Patrick A. Feehan to petition for a parish. Archbishop Feehan granted the request and appointed Rev. Casimir A. Slominski as pastor. A former assistant at St. Adalbert's, Father Slominski began his work in Cicero on May 30, 1895. Stephen Bartoszek, one of the pioneer parishioners, transformed his hall at the northwest corner of Jessamine (now 48th Court) and 30th Street into a combination church-school and he offered the rear flat as living quarters for the pastor. In this temporary church, Father Slominski celebrated Mass and administered the sacraments until a frame church was built a few months later. In July 1898, Father Slominski directed the construction of a one-room frame building behind the church. This structure, known as the parish hall, also served as a school. When Father Slominski resigned because of poor health in 1899, Rev. Leo Wyrzykowski was named pastor of St. Mary of Czƒôstochowa Church. Father Slominski later organized St. Ann Church at 18th Place and Leavitt Street in Chicago where he served as pastor from 1903 to 1921. In 1902, the mission of St. Attracta was established at 13th Street and 48th Court for English-speaking Catholics who lived in the northeast section of Cicero, then known as the Grant Works area. In 1903, the Western Electric Company opened a plant in Hawthorne at 22nd Street (Cermak Road) and Cicero Avenue and it quickly became the largest employer in Cicero. Over the years, the Western Electric Company provided jobs for thousands of immigrants of many nationalities. Following Father Wyrzykowski's appointment as pastor of St. Mary of Gosty≈Ñ Church in Downers Grove, Illinois (now in the Joliet diocese) in July 1904, Rev. Bronislaus Czajkowski became pastor of St. Mary of Czƒôstochowa Church. Prior to this assignment, he had served as an assistant at the Polish parish of St. Mary of Perpetual Help in Chicago. The new pastor found that the frame church and school had become inadequate and as a temporary measure, converted the parish hall behind the church into two classrooms. In August 1904, the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Third order of Francis of Assisi began their work in the parish school which previously had been staffed by lay teachers. With the generous support of his parishioners, Father Czajkowski was made plans for a new combination church-school building, the cornerstone of which was laid on July 2, 1905. This imposing brick structure was completed at the southeast corner of 30th Street and Linden (49th) Avenue In 1908, the Sisters moved from their living quarters in the school building into a new convent which had been constructed at 3009 South 49th Court. The Polish population of the South Lawndale area of Chicago, on Cicero's east boundary, increased to such an extent that in 1907, the Archdiocese of Chicago organized Good Shepherd parish at 28th Street and Kolin Avenue from portions of St. Mary of Czƒôstochowa and St. Casimir parishes. In 1911, Polish families who formerly belonged to St. Mary of Czƒôstochowa organized the national parish of St. Valentine at 13th Street and 50th Avenue. On July 24, 1915, 800 employees of the Western Electric Company died as the Eastland excursion boat capsized in the Chicago River. Twenty-nine parishioners lost their lives in that tragedy and were remembered in a memorial Mass. In June 1916, the parish broke ground at the southwest corner of 48th Court and 30th Street for a magnificent Gothic revival structure. When the cornerstone of this edifice was laid on October 29, 1917, work was nearing completion on the present rectory at 3010 South 48th Court. Archbishop George W. Mundelein dedicated St. Mary of Czƒôstochowa Church on March 10, 1918. Hundreds of Poles gathered in the silver-bedecked church of St. Mary on May 31, 1920, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of their parish. Membership then numbered 800 families with 900 children enrolled in the school. A history of St. Mary of Czƒôstochowa parish written in 1920 contained the information that \\"At present this parish consists of the church with its contents worth $135,000.00; school, worth $85,000.00; rectory, which is worth $30,000.00; convent, worth $25,000.00; frame ex-church [the parish hall]... worth $3,000.00; and lots worth about $25,000.00. Total worth,$303,000.00\\" Father Czajkowski continued to serve as pastor throughout the Great Depression, a hard time for his parishioners who keenly felt the effects of factory closings in Cicero. He died October 13, 1939, at the age of 65. Rev. Francis Nogajewski served as administrator of the parish until July 1940, when Rev. Theodore F. Langfort was named pastor. A former assistant at St. Mary of Czƒôstochowa parish, Father Langfort had served as pastor of St. Valentine Church in Cicero and as pastor of the Polish parish of Assumption, BVM in Chicago. The new pastor carried out a program of reconstruction and expansion that included repair and remodeling all the parish buildings and redecoration of the church in preparation for upcoming the golden jubilee, May 6, 1945. In its 50th year, St. Mary of Czƒôstochowa parish numbered more than 1,600 families and the parish supported 43 societies. Father Langfort continued to serve as pastor of this large Polish parish until his death on November 27, 1956, at the age of 73. In January 1957, Rev. Ignatius S. Renklewski became pastor. A former assistant at St. Mary of Czƒôstochowa parish, he returned to Cicero from Chicago where he had been serving as administrator of the Polish parish of St. Ann. Father Renklewski made plans for an addition to the convent which was completed early in 1958 and he also purchased a statue of Our Lady of Czƒôstochowa which he placed in front of the rectory. This outdoor shrine was dedicated on September 16, 1959 in ceremonies which included a procession of religious groups singing Marian songs. On February 7, 1960, Father Renklewski was invested as a Domestic Prelate with the title Right Reverend Monsignor. On November 13, 1960, the diocesan officials granted permission to construct a Youth Center on the site of the former Hawthorne School at 5004 South 31st Street. A dream come true for the parish, this one-story building was financed in large part by the proceeds from carnivals held in the parish from 1946 to 1960. Albert Gregory Meyer laid the cornerstone of the Youth Center on February 19, 1961; while work was underway on this structure, a program of renovation began on May 28, 1961 that modernized and expanded the church and refurbished the school and rectory. Since the dedication of the $300,000 Youth Center on September 17, 1961, this building had provided the finest of facilities for the young people of the community. Msgr. Renklewski died on March 26, 1965, at the age of 76. In his obituary, The New World noted that: He was a former member of the Archdiocesan school board completing his term in 1961; was chaplain of the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America, a member of the board of the Polish Roman Catholic cemetery association, and a Fourth degree member of Garcia Moreno council, Knights of Columbus (Harvey). Rev. Joseph C. Przybylowicz, former pastor of St. Isidore Church in Blue Island, Illinois, was appointed pastor of St. Mary's parish on March 4, 1966. He led planning for the parish's 75th anniversary. On October 11, 1970, Bishop Aloysius J. Wycislo of Green Bay, Wisconsin. officiated at the special Diamond Jubilee Mass. A graduate of St. Mary's school, Bishop Wycislo served as Auxiliary Bishop of Chicago prior to his appointment as Ordinary of the Green Bay Diocese in 1968. At the time of the 75th celebration, 16 young men from St. Mary of Czƒôstochowa parish had been ordained priests, and 28 young women had entered religious orders. Mrs. Frances Wilary catered and donated a dinner held in the parish hail following the jubilee Mass for all clergy, religious, choir members, Knights of Columbus, and special guests. A civic observance, a commemorative dinner-dance honoring the faithful members of the parish, was held on October 25, 1970, at Richard's Banquet Room, 3243 South Harlem Avenue in Berwyn, Illinois. On January 1, 1979, Father Przybylowicz was named pastor emeritus and Rev. Thaddeus J. Makuch was appointed pastor of St. Mary's Church. Prior to this appointment, Father Makuch had served as associate pastor of SS. Peter and Paul Church at 37th and Paulina Streets in Chicago for five years. On July 1, 2003, priests of the Redemptorist Congregation arrived in Cicero. The Polish Redemptorists began serving the spiritual need of this trilingual parish. Custom and language are part of celebrations, and St. Mary's celebrates the Feast of Our Lady of Czƒôstochowa in August with special Masses, procession through the neighborhood, ethnic food, and the final gathering for the ice cream social. On December 12 of each year, the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe begins with Ma√±anitas at 5:00 a.m., a special Mass with the distribution of roses, and a social gathering enjoying hot chocolate. Many couples who choose St. Mary's for their wedding place a bouquet before the icon of Our Lady of Guadalupe or Our Lady of Czƒôstochowa as part of the service. The church and school complex built in 1905 is still used today for the parish school and religious education programs. The convent building today houses the chancery for the Syro-Malabar Eastern Rite congregation for the Diocese of the United States and Canada. The Youth Center building, now called The Social Center, is the site for the school's physical education classes, athletic program, an active senior group, and the public school preschool program. For over 100 years St. Mary of Czƒôstochowa Parish has provided a basic spiritual need by offering daily Mass, Sunday Masses and special services in three languages, novenas, missions, a place for the adoration of Christ in the Holy Eucharist and a sacred and beautiful space to celebrate the reception of the sacraments. Architecture St. Mary of Czƒôstochowa church in Cicero, Illinois The church, one of the few Polish churches designed in a Gothic style, was completed in 1918. The twin towers of this church, which rise above the ground, are visible from many points in Cicero. The beautiful Gothic altars, pulpit, and a communion rail-all crafted in Italy of Carrara marble-date from 1927. High atop the main altar, which was dedicated to Our Lady of Czƒôstochowa, is a copy of the celebrated \\"Black Madonna\\", the miraculous icon ascribed to the evangelist St. Luke.

Their professionalism, musicianship, and commitment have been unwavering and for that and a whole lot more I am truly thankful.\\" In the fall of 2009, Birchall debuted with the Spaghetti Western Orchestra, a highly theatrical and musical interpretation of the western cinematic works of Ennio Morricone. A 2010/11 tour culminated in a live BBC Radio and TV performance at the Royal Albert Hall in the 2011 season of the BBC Proms on 14 August. The Albert Hall performance attracted more attention to the group and the 2011 tour was followed up with a UK and European tour in 2012.

It is associated with the Southern Baptist Convention, Kentucky Baptist Convention, and the Long Run Baptist Association. History Walnut Street Baptist Church was founded in 1815 as the First Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky. In the beginning the congregation had 18 members who met primarily in their homes. The congregation served the Louisville community for 30 years as First Baptist Church. In 1845 the First and Second Baptist churches called the same Pastor and the two congregations merged and built a facility on corner of Fourth and Walnut Street (now called Muhammad Ali Boulevard) in Louisville. The newly merged congregation's sanctuary could seat 600. It remained in this location until 1902. It was decided to move as the congregation had outgrown its facility with Sunday school attendance topping 1000. At this time Walnut Street Baptist Church moved to its present location on the corner of third and Saint Catherine Streets in what is now Old Louisville. By this time it was considered by some to be the largest church in the South. As the 20th century progressed the church grew to encompass over two city blocks. By the 1960s the congregation was responsible for starting directly or indirectly 78 churches in the Long Run Association encompassing the Louisville area. In the 1970s and 1980s this racially diverse downtown congregation stayed in its location despite over two thirds of the congregation living outside the downtown corridor. Expanded inner-city and activities ministries were added at this time to adapt to urban ministry in the latter part of the century. Peak attendance in this period of exceeded 3,500 in Sunday School and weekly worship. The 1970s also saw the beginning of the Living Christmas Tree which continued until 2006. This Annual \\"gift to the city\\" of choral and instrumental performance was free and drew on average 35,000 to its 16 performances at its peak. In the 1990s the congregation recommitted itself to its downtown philosophy by undertaking a multimillion- dollar campus update. Today the congregation has active ministries including a retirement home, subsidized apartments, a counseling center, weekly worship, Christian education, Christian social ministry, global mission partnerships and recreational activities and sustains a membership of over 2,500. Current weekly attendance is about 350. Other history and statistics * One of the first churches to build a recreation center including amenities such as a bowling alley, racquetball court, skating ring, billiard hall, dining room with a capacity of 1200 and gymnasium, as well as meeting space. * Over the course of its existence the congregation is responsible for either directly or indirectly founding 65% of the Southern Baptist churches in The Greater Louisville Area. * Congregation and its pastors were key in the relocation of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary to Louisville from South Carolina. * Three former pastors have been the President of the Southern Baptist Convention. * The TV ministry has 40,000 viewing households weekly. * Congregation responsible for the foundation of the Kentucky Baptist Homes for children.

He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1906 to 1913, sitting with the Liberal caucus in government. He also served as the mayor of Vegreville, Alberta from 1917 to 1945. Alberta legislature Holden ran for election to the Alberta Legislature in a by-election held on July 16, 1906, as a Liberal candidate in the electoral district of Vermilion. He won the seat by acclamation to hold the district for his party. The 1909 boundary redistribution redistributed the Vermilion electoral district. Holden won election in the new Vegreville electoral district in the election held that year. Holden did not run for a third term in office and so left the legislature at its dissolution in 1913. Other activities Holden briefly moved to Vancouver to get into the shipping business, but moved back to Alberta when it went bust. Holden married Gertrude Jane Worth. After his provincial political career, James had a substantial municipal career serving many terms as Mayor of Vegreville, Alberta from 1917 to 1945. Holden also attempted a career in federal politics. He ran for a seat to the House of Commons of Canada for the first time in the 1917 federal election. He ran as a government supporting candidate in the electoral district of Victoria but was defeated finishing second in the three-way race losing to William Henry White and finishing ahead of former Governor of Kansas, John W. Leedy. Holden ran for federal office a second time in the 1921 again in the electoral district of Victoria. He lost the three-way race as the Conservative candidate in a landslide finishing a distant third place to United Farmers candidate William Lucas. Holden would attempt federal over a number of years later for his third and last time in the 1935 Canadian federal election. This time he finished last place out of five candidates in the Vegreville district losing to William Hayhurst.

Grass choke disease is a symptom in grasses induced by some Epichlo√´ species, which form spore-bearing mats (stromata) on tillers and suppress the development of their host plant's inflorescence. For most of their life cycle however, Epichlo√´ grow in the intercellular space of stems, leaves, inflorescences, and seeds of the grass plant without incurring symptoms of disease. In fact, they provide several benefits to their host, including the production of different herbivore-deterring alkaloids, increased stress resistance, and growth promotion. Within the family Clavicipitaceae, Epichlo√´ is embedded in a group of endophytic and plant pathogenic fungi, whose common ancestor probably derived from an animal pathogen. The genus includes both species with a sexually reproducing (teleomorphic) stage and asexual, anamorphic species. The latter were previously placed in the form genus Neotyphodium but included in Epichlo√´ after molecular phylogenetics had shown asexual and sexual species to be intermingled in a single clade. Hybrid speciation has played an important role in the evolution of the genus. Epichlo√´ species are ecologically significant through their effects on host plants. Their presence has been shown to alter the composition of plant communities and food webs. Grass varieties, especially of tall fescue and ryegrass, with symbiotic Epichlo√´ endophyte strains, are commercialised and used for pasture and turf. Taxonomy Elias Fries, in 1849, first defined Epichlo√´ as a subgenus of Cordyceps. As type species, he designated Cordyceps typhina, originally described by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. The brothers Charles and Louis Ren√© Tulasne then raised the subgenus to genus rank in 1865. Epichlo√´ typhina would remain the only species in the genus until the discovery of fungal grass endophytes causing livestock intoxications in the 1970s and 1980s, which stimulated the description of new species. Several species from Africa and Asia that develop stromata on grasses were split off as a separate genus Parepichlo√´ in 1998. Many Epichlo√´ species have forms that reproduce sexually, and several purely asexual species are closely related to them. These anamorphs were long classified separately: Morgan-Jones and Gams (1982) collected them in a section (Albo-lanosa) of genus Acremonium. In a molecular phylogenetic study in 1996, Glenn and colleagues found the genus to be polyphyletic and proposed a new genus Neotyphodium for the anamorphic species related to Epichlo√´. A number of species continued to be described in both genera until Leuchtmann and colleagues (2014) included most of the form genus Neotyphodium in Epichlo√´. Phylogenetic studies had shown both genera to be intermingled, and the nomenclatural code required since 2011 that one single name be used for all stages of development of a fungal species. Only Neotyphodium starrii, of unclear status, and N. chilense, which is unrelated, were excluded from Epichlo√´.

The best-studied of these symbionts are associated with the grasses and sedges, in which they infect the leaves and other aerial tissues by growing between the plant cells (endophytic growth) or on the surface above or beneath the cuticle (epiphytic growth). An individual infected plant will generally bear only a single genetic individual clavicipitaceous symbiont, so the plant-fungus system constitutes a genetic unit called a symbiotum (pl. symbiota). Symptoms and signs of the fungal infection, if manifested at all, only occur on a specific tissue or site of the host tiller, where the fungal stroma or sclerotium emerges. The stroma (pl. stromata) is a mycelial cushion that gives rise first to asexual spores (conidia), then to the sexual fruiting bodies (ascocarps; perithecia). Sclerotia are hard resting structures that later (after incubation on the ground) germinate to form stipate stromata. Depending on the fungus species, the host tissues on which stromata or sclerotia are produced may be young inflorescences and surrounding leaves, individual florets, nodes, or small segments of the leaves. Young stromata are hyaline (colorless), and as they mature they turn dark gray, black, or yellow-orange. Mature stromata eject meiotically derived spores (ascospores), which are ejected into the atmosphere and initiate new plant infections (horizontal transmission). In some cases no stroma or sclerotium is produced, but the fungus infects seeds produced by the infected plant, and is thereby transmitted vertically to the next host generation. Most Epichlo√´ species, and all asexual species, can vertically transmit. The taxonomic dichotomy is especially interesting in this group of symbionts, because vegetative propagation of fungal mycelium occurs by vertical transmission, i.e., fungal growth into newly developing host tillers (=individual grass plants). Importantly, many Epichlo√´ species infect new grass plants solely by growing into the seeds of their grass hosts, and infecting the growing seedling. Manifestation of the sexual state ‚Äî which only occurs in Epichlo√´ species ‚Äî causes \\"choke disease\\", a condition in which grass inflorescences are engulfed by rapid fungal outgrowth forming a stroma. The fungal stroma suppresses host seed production and culminates in the ejection of meiospores (ascospores) that mediate horizontal (contagious) transmission of the fungus to new plants. So, the two transmission modes exclude each other, although in many grass-Epichlo√´ symbiota the fungus actually displays both transmission modes simultaneously, by choking some tillers and transmitting in seeds produced by unchoked tillers. While being obligate symbionts in nature, most epichloae are readily culturable in the laboratory on culture media such as potato dextrose agar or a minimal salts broth supplemented with thiamine, sugars or sugar alcohols, and organic nitrogen or ammonium. Epichlo√´ species are commonly spread by flies of the genus Botanophila. The flies lay their eggs in the growing fungal tissues and the larvae feed on them. A stroma of Epichlo√´ baconii formed on the grass Agrostis stolonifera, showing eggs, brood chambers and larval feeding tracks of Botanophila flies. Evolution The epichloae display a number of central features that suggest a very strong and ancient association with their grass hosts. The symbiosis appears to have existed already during the early grass evolution that has spawned today's pooid grasses. This is suggested by phylogenetic studies indicating a preponderance of codivergence of Epichlo√´ species with the grass hosts they inhabit. Growth of the fungal symbiont is very tightly regulated within its grass host, indicated by a largely unbranched mycelial morphology and remarkable synchrony of grass leaf and hyphal extension of the fungus; the latter seems to occur via a mechanism that involves stretch-induced or intercalary elongation of the endophyte's hyphae, a process so far not found in any other fungal species, indicating specialized adaptation of the fungus to the dynamic growth environment inside its host. A complex NADPH oxidase enzyme-based ROS-generating system in Epichlo√´ species is indispensable for maintenance of this growth synchrony. Thus, it has been demonstrated that deletion of genes encoding these enzymes in Epichlo√´ festucae causes severely disordered fungal growth in grass tissues and even death of the grass plant. Molecular phylogenetic evidence demonstrates that asexual Epichlo√´ species are derived either from sexual Epichlo√´ species, or more commonly, are hybrids of two or more progenitor Epichlo√´ species. Bioactive compounds insecticidal alkaloid produced in several Epichlo√´‚Äìgrass symbiota. Many Epichlo√´ endophytes produce a diverse range of natural product compounds with biological activities against a broad range of herbivores. The purpose of these compounds is as a toxicity or feeding deterrence against insect and mammalian herbivores. Ergoline alkaloids (which are ergot alkaloids, named after the ergot fungus, Claviceps purpurea, a close relative of the epichloae) are characterized by a ring system derived from 4-prenyl tryptophan. Among the most abundant ergot alkaloids in epichlo√´- symbiotic grasses is ergovaline, comprising an ergoline moiety attached to a bicyclic tripeptide containing the amino acids L-proline, L-alanine, and L-valine. Key genes and enzymes for ergot alkaloid biosynthesis have been identified in epichloae and include dmaW, encoding dimethylallyl-tryptophan synthase and lpsA, a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase. Another group of epichlo√´ alkaloids are the indole-diterpenoids, such as lolitrem B, which are produced from the activity of several enzymes, including prenyltransferases and various monooxygenases. Both the ergoline and indole-diterpenoid alkaloids have biological activity against mammalian herbivores, and also activity against some insects. Peramine is a pyrrolopyrazine alkaloid thought to be biosynthesized from the guanidinium-group-containing amino acid L-arginine, and pyrrolidine-5-carboxylate, a precursor of L-proline, and is an insect- feeding deterrent. The loline alkaloids are 1-aminopyrrolizidines with an oxygen atom linking bridgehead carbons 2 and 7, and are biosynthesized from the amino acids L-proline and L-homoserine. The lolines have insecticidal and insect-deterrent activities comparable to nicotine. Loline accumulation is strongly induced in young growing tissues or by damage to the plant-fungus symbiotum. Many, but not all, epichloae produce up to three classes of these alkaloids in various combinations and amounts. Recently it has been shown that Epichlo√´ uncinata infection and loline content afford √ó Festulolium grasses protection from black beetle (Heteronychus arator). Many species in Epichlo√´ produce biologically active alkaloids, such as ergot alkaloids, indole- diterpenoids (e.g., lolitrem B), loline alkaloids, and the unusual guanidinium alkaloid, peramine. Ecology =Effects on the grass plant= It has been proposed that vertically transmitted symbionts should evolve to be mutualists since their reproductive fitness is intimately tied to that of their hosts. In fact, some positive effects of epichloae on their host plants include increased growth, drought tolerance, and herbivore and pathogen resistance. Resistance against herbivores has been attributed to alkaloids produced by the symbiotic epichloae. Although grass-epichlo√´ symbioses have been widely recognized to be mutualistic in many wild and cultivated grasses, the interactions can be highly variable and sometimes antagonistic, especially under nutrient-poor conditions in the soil. =Ecosystem dynamics= Due to the relatively large number of grass species harboring epichloae and the variety of environments in which they occur, the mechanisms underlying beneficial or antagonistic outcomes of epichlo√´-grass symbioses are difficult to delineate in natural and also agricultural environments. Some studies suggest a relationship between grazing by herbivores and increased epichlo√´ infestation of the grasses on which they feed, whereas others indicate a complex interplay between plant species and fungal symbionts in response to herbivory or environmental conditions. The strong anti-herbivore activities of several bioactive compounds produced by the epichloae and relatively modest direct effects of the epichloae on plant growth and physiology suggest that these compounds play a major role in the persistence of the symbiosis.

These mostly arise in generalizations and are particularly common in abstract, theoretical or strategic discourse. Examples (with the antecedent in boldface and the referring pronoun in italics) include \\"readers of wikipedia appreciate their encyclopedia,\\" \\"the customer who spends in this market.\\" The question of appropriate style for using pronouns to refer to such generic antecedents in the English language became politicized in the 1970s, and remains a matter of substantial dispute.'Gender', in The American Heritage Book of English Usage: A Practical and Authoritative Guide to Contemporary English, (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1996). Treatment in various languages Many languages share the following issue with English: the generic antecedent is a representative individual of a class, whose gender is unknown or irrelevant, but pronouns are gender-specific. In languages such as English that distinguish natural gender in pronouns but not grammatical gender in nouns, normally masculine, but sometimes feminine, forms of pronouns are used for the generic reference, in what is called the generic usage of the pronoun. The context makes the generic intent of the usage clear in communication. * Example: An ambitious academic will publish as soon as she can. Unless there is reason to believe the speaker thinks ambitious academics are always female in the relevant context, the use of she in this sentence must be interpreted as a generic use. Traditionally both he and they were used for this purpose but, particularly since the nineteenth century, English style guides have frequently recommended the otherwise masculine he as a singular generic pronoun. Since the middle of the twentieth century the use of he for this purpose has been discouraged, partly because use of he is perceived as subtly biasing the listener to assume the antecedent is masculine. Various alternatives have been proposed. =French= In French both the singular and plural pronouns in the third person are marked for grammatical gender, and the antecedent always has grammatical gender. The masculine form of \\"they\\", ils, is always used when referring to a plural and grammatically masculine antecedent, while for plural antecedents that are grammatically feminine the feminine form elles of \\"they\\" is used. Likewise, in the singular the third person pronoun il is used to refer to grammatically masculine antecedents and elle is used to refer to grammatically feminine antecedents. Thus, for both generic and non-generic antecedents, the natural gender of the antecedent, whether known or unknown, is irrelevant, as the deciding factor for the choice of a referring pronoun is the grammatical gender of the antecedent. Some French speakers advocate the use of created gender-free pronouns, such as illes or els for ils et elles (\\"they (masculine) and they (feminine)\\") and celleux or ceulles for celles et ceux (\\"those (feminine) and those (masculine)\\"). =Mandarin Chinese= In spoken Mandarin Chinese, and in the pinyin form of writing Mandarin in the Latin alphabet, there is no distinction between \\"he\\" and \\"she\\" (tƒÅ in each case), nor is there a distinction between \\"they (masculine)\\" and \\"they (feminine)\\" (tƒÅmen in each case). However, when Mandarin is written in characters, a gender distinction is made: tƒÅ is written as ‰ªñ or Â•π for \\"he\\" or \\"she\\" respectively, with -men (‰ª¨) added for the plural. For a plural generic antecedent such as \\"people (in general)\\", the referring pronoun will always be written as the masculine plural form unless the generic group is known to be inherently female (as in \\"women (in general)\\"), in which case the feminine form is used. For a singular generic antecedent such as \\"someone\\", the referring pronoun is always written as the masculine singular form unless the generic antecedent is known to be inherently female (as in \\"(an unspecified) woman\\"). Gender in English pronouns If an antecedent is a thing, either specific or generic (such as a snowman), rather than a person, the appropriate pronoun to refer back to it is it, and no difficulty arises. Likewise, if the antecedent is more than one thing, again either specific or generic, the pronoun they is used to refer back to them, and again no difficulty arises. When the antecedent is a specific person (whose gender is therefore known), the correct referring pronoun is either he or she, depending on the person's gender. When the antecedent is a specific group of two or more people, the pronoun they is used, again without any difficulty arising. And when the antecedent is generic and plural, again the pronoun they is used and is not problematic, because they is not gender-specific. But difficulty arises in choosing a singular pronoun to refer to a single, unspecified human (whose gender is indeterminate, as the reference is equally to a hypothetical male or a hypothetical female). In particular, the overlap of generic use with gender role stereotyping has led to controversy in English.Julie Foertsch and Morton Ann Gernsbacher, 'In Search of Gender Neutrality: Is Singular They a Cognitively Efficient Substitute for Generic He?' Psychological Science 8 (1997): 106‚Äì111. * A nurse should ensure that she gets adequate rest. * A police officer should maintain his fitness. * A dancer should watch her diet carefully. * A boss should treat his staff well. In these examples, some speakers might mean that all nurses are female, or that all bosses are male, while others might intend the pronouns as generic and hence gender-unspecific. Ambiguity arises from the possibility that the listener might interpret the meaning differently from what the speaker intended. Approaches taken in English Speakers of all languages use words both to make distinctions and to generalize: * Example of distinction: My mother thinks..., but my father says.... * Example of generalization: Parents believe.... * Example of generalization: Any [or Every] parent believes.... What has become controversial among users of English is the choice of pronoun to refer back to a generalized, and hence generic, singular antecedent such as any parent, or every parent. Examples of accepted, disputed, and impossible constructions in English include: * 25px All people get hungry, so they eat. Acceptable (All people is plural.) * 25px All people get hungry, so she eats. Incorrect if all people is the intended antecedent of she (singular pronoun cannot have a plural antecedent.) * 25px Each one gets thirsty, so he drinks. Disputed (Is he generic, or are all members of the group male?) * 25px Each one gets thirsty, so they drink. Acceptable Long in use (by Shakespeare, for example); but condemned by some older sources, such as The Elements of Style, but endorsed by many modern style guides. * 25px Each one gets thirsty, so he or she drinks. Awkward (especially if used repeatedly) and recommended against by the Chicago Manual of Style, et al. * 25px When a person is tired, she sleeps. Disputed (Is she specific or generic?) English guidelines before the 1980s supported the use of he as a singular pronoun that can refer to both men and women (generic usage). Use of the generic he, however, has been decreasing since the 1960s. Many recent style guides discourage generic constructions or accept approaches other than the generic he. Some writers prefer to alternate between male and female generic usage to provide clarity without the appearance of bias. Other speakers intentionally use female generic forms as a political or cultural statement against the conventional practice of generic use of the masculine form. A study of English language usage over the past twenty years shows that they is now the most common way that modern speakers and writers refer back to generic antecedents.Updating the New International Version of the Bible: Notes from the Committee on Bible Translation =Modern solutions= Speakers opposed to gender role stereotyping often use one of the following strategies.Michael Quinion, 'Gender-Neutral Pronouns', 2002. * A boss should treat her staff well. (Use of the pronoun opposite to expected gender) * Bosses should treat their staff well. (Making the antecedent plural, thus requiring the use of a plural pronoun, which in English is not gender- specific) * A boss should treat their staff well. (Use of singular they, incorrect in formal English according to some sources, especially older or traditional ones, but accepted by others). * A boss should treat eir staff well. (Rare use of a Spivak pronoun; also see gender-neutral pronoun.) There is historical precedent for the third option\\"A person can't help their birth.\\" William Makepeace Thackeray, Vanity Fair, 1848, c. 41. as well as popular contemporary usage. However, there are contemporary, as well as historical, style guides that discourage this option. =Other alternatives= Options other than generic pronouns, rephrasing in the plural, or using they can be well suited to some contexts, but problematic in others. * A boss should treat her or his staff well. (Issues: cumbersome if overused, have to place genders in an order.) * If (s)he does, it is good. (Issue: written option only.) * Thon will be happy and so will they. (Issue: none of the invented pronouns ‚Äì thon, xe, and many others ‚Äì have been accepted into the language.)Dennis Baron, 'The Epicene Pronouns: A Chronology of the Word That Failed', 2006. The indefinite personal pronoun, one, is suitably singular and unspecific with respect to gender; but it can take only \\"one\\" as an antecedent. * One takes care of one's own. =Opinions= Some modern prescriptivists argue from the valid use of they in certain contexts, to making it valid or even mandatory in all. Other prescriptivists argue that generic he should be proscribed. Both these points of view have found many followers; however, they generally do not accurately describe the usage or rationale of the wide range of options common in the English language.

Cassidy was a southpaw (left-handed) who was world-rated in the junior middleweight, middleweight, light heavyweight and cruiserweight divisions. In 1975, he was ranked number one in the world as a light heavyweight by the World Boxing Council. In 1963, Cassidy, from Levittown, Long Island, New York, scored a one-punch, 39-second knockout in his professional debut at Sunnyside Garden. He went on to compile a ring record of 59 wins, 16 losses, three draws, one no contest and 27 knockouts. Among the notable fighters that he defeated were Don Fullmer, Jimmy Dupree, Tom Bethea, Isaac Logart, Ramon Ranquello, Tommy Hicks and Christy Elliott. He also fought world champions Luis Manuel Rodr√≠guez, Rodrigo Valdez and Alessandro Mazzinghi. In a six-month span of 1973, Cassidy fought Dupree three times, for a total of 30 rounds. Both light heavyweights were ranked in the top 10 at the time. They fought to a draw in the first fight, Dupree won a split decision in the second fight and Cassidy won a unanimous decision in the third. The final meeting was held at Madison Square Garden's Felt Forum. Cassidy dropped Dupree three times in the fight. The Dupree fights were part of stretch during which Cassidy fought eight consecutive opponents ranked in the Top 10. Throughout his career he fought main events in both the old and current Madison Square Garden. After his boxing career, Cassidy began training fighters and has worked with two world champions, WBC light heavyweight champion Donny Lalonde and WBO middleweight champion Lonnie Bradley. He also trained Ugandan contender Godfrey Nyakana. As an actor, Cassidy has appeared in three films, Rocky, Uncle Joe Shannon and This Thing of Ours.

Coloma joined the army as an ensign in 1581 and campaigned in Portugal, Sicily, the Netherlands and Germany, eventually making his way up to the rank of maestro de campo general. He played an important part in the Siege of Doullens (1595). After serving as governor of the Roussillon (1600-1611) and viceroy of Mallorca (1611-1617), he became governor of Cambrai in 1617. In 1621 he took over from Spinola as commander-in-chief of the Spanish invasion of the Electorate of the Palatinate. The following year he succeeded the Count of Gondomar as Spanish ambassador to England. Recalled when war broke out between England and Spain in 1624, he participated in Spinola's Siege of Breda (August 1624-June 1625) and is supposedly portrayed on Vel√°zquez' Las Lanzas. After a term as commander in Milan, Coloma returned to London in 1630 to restore peace between the two crowns. From 1631 until his return to Spain in 1634, he acted as commander-in-chief of the Army of Flanders. During his final years he served King Philip IV as mayordomo mayor and member of the Council of State. Coloma received the habito of the Order of Santiago in 1591 and was given the Commandry of Montiel y La Ossa in 1621. On 16 September 1627, Philip IV created him Marquess of Espinar.

It is a unit of the Technical College System of Georgia and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Since opening its doors as the Gwinnett Area Technical School in 1984, the college has added numerous programs of study, made two name changes, expanded its facilities and experienced enrollment growth. Currently, the Lawrenceville campus is 88 acres and the Alpharetta-North Fulton Campus is 25 acres. Founding, growth, and name changes  In 1984, to meet the demand for technological training, the Gwinnett Area Technical School was founded. The school subsequently expanded its offerings to include a wider variety of high- tech programs. In 1988, the name was changed to Gwinnett Technical Institute, aligning Gwinnett Tech with the network of state technical institutes under the Georgia Department of Technical and Adult Education (DTAE). The following year, DTAE approved Gwinnett Tech to grant associate degrees in applied technology (AAT) in six programming areas, which paved the way for Gwinnett Tech to pursue accreditation with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. Gwinnett Technical Institute changed its name on July 6, 2000 to Gwinnett Technical College to better reflect its position within the region's higher education market. The name change was made possible by Georgia's A+ Education Reform Act of 2000, which allowed technical institutes with proper accreditation to be designated as colleges. History of expansion During its 28-year history, Gwinnett Technical College has expanded its campus to include a variety of new facilities, including the Health Sciences Building, Corporate Training Center, Environmental Horticulture Center and Computer Training Center. The George Busbee International Center for Workforce Development(Lawrenceville Building 700) opened in spring 2003 and is dedicated to workforce training. The Busbee Center includes a 350-seat auditorium and a technology center with flexible meeting, conference, classroom and exhibit space. Gwinnett Tech opened the D. Scott Hudgens, Jr. Early Education Center during the summer of 2006. The $7 million facility serves as a interactive classroom and observation site for students enrolled in the college's Early Childhood Care and Education program and provide the community with early childhood care and pre-school instruction, including two Georgia Pre-K classes. Today, Gwinnett Tech offers more than 150 associate degree, diploma and certificate programs and hundreds of continuing education seminars and workshops to improve job skills and provide specialized training.

It has a population of approximately 240 people and is situated on the Clare- Peterborough Road (B79), 238 km (148 mi) from Adelaide, the state capital. History The Hundred of Yongala was proclaimed in the County of Dalhousie in 1871, one of the first of the twelve hundreds to be declared in that county, opening up the area for closer settlement and small-scale cultivation. The town was proclaimed on 23 May 1876. Within five years there was a population of 353 as developers anticipated the connection of a railway. Instead, the railway was built through the nearby town of Peterborough. The SS Yongala launched in 1903 and owned by the Adelaide Steamship Company was named after the town. It sank in a storm in 1911 off the coast of Townsville, Queensland and its wreck site is protected by the Commonwealth Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976. Geography and climate Yongala has a mild semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen BSk) with some continental influences. It is situated on a high plateau and winter snowfalls are common.

Payless Drug Stores was a 1974 decision of the Oregon Supreme Court regarding an alleged case of shoplifting. The case deals mainly with the issues of malice and probable cause from a legal standpoint. Facts Gustafson (plaintiff) a California resident and her husband, was visiting relatives in Salem, Oregon, when Gustafson and her mother-in-law visited the local Payless Drug Store (company later acquired by Rite Aid). Gustafson inadvertently left the store without paying for a pack of cigarettes, when a security officer then asked Gustafson to purchase the cigarettes. Gustafson said she apologized for her mistake and stated that she had been distracted had forgotten to pay. Upon re-entering the store Gustafson was arrested for shoplifting. The security officer notified the police, and the Gustafson was escorted to the police station. Consequently, she sued the store, claiming probable cause had not been established. The jury found in favor of Gustafson, and awarded $36,000 in damages, including $25,000 punitive, and Payless appealed. Question Was the lack of probable cause sufficient evidence of malice upon the part of the defendant to enable the jury to find for the plaintiff? Holding Yes (Affirmed). Decision In reciting the opinion of the court, Justice Denecke defined the requirements for the establishment of probable cause. Probable cause exists if the person initiating the action adheres to the following: *reasonable belief that the person accused has acted or failed to act in a particular manner, *belief that such acts or omissions constitute at common law or under an existing statute the offense charged against the accused. Payless argued that the court erred in its decision, claiming probable cause had been established. Justice Denecke asserted that it is the duty of the court, not the jury, to determine probable cause. Furthermore, Denecke noted that the facts agreed upon by the court favored the defendant. Thus the ruling provided the greatest possible merit to the defendant's claims and still found Payless had no probable cause to arrest the plaintiff. Specifically, when presenting their version of the facts, the defendant contradicted Mrs. Gustafson's statement in three particular areas. # The security guard claimed the plaintiff had exited the store with the cigarettes passing a checkout stand. (This indicates shoplifting, as it implies that the plaintiff knowingly exited the store without paying for the item.) # The security guard claimed the cigarettes had been placed on the far left of the vehicle, indicating an effort to conceal the merchandise. # Finally, the security guard claimed the plaintiff, when confronted about the cigarettes, stated that she forgot to pay, and that no apologies were made as claimed by Mrs. Gustafson. To these three claims, the court responded that no attempt was made to conceal the cigarettes. Thus, even if it was supposed that the defendant was correct in its other two contradictions to the facts, probable cause had still not been established for the arrest. The plaintiff never behaved in a suspicious manner which would suggest shoplifting, or which implied guilt or provided probable cause. Mrs. Gustafson kept the merchandise in plain view. She attempted to pay for the item. She waited for an extended period outside the store after exiting. She purchased additional items. None of this behavior is consistent with that of a shoplifter, and the security guard was aware of Gustafson's conduct. Payless also contended that it had probable cause because it acted upon the advice of the deputy district attorney, and that the action against the plaintiff was brought as a result of the police officer and the deputy district attorney, as opposed to Payless itself although the deputy district attorney's involvement began after the arrest, and was predicated by the facts provided by Payless. These facts left out a number of relevant points. In failing to supply all the relevant details, Payless became instrumental in \\"putting the law in force,\\" thus voiding the claim of probable cause through the advice of the deputy district attorney. Denecke finally noted that it had been consistently held that the jury may make a finding of malice based upon a lack of probable cause. Given that probable cause was not established, sufficient evidence of malice was found upon the part of the defendant to enable the jury to find for the plaintiff. Dissent Justice Holman dissented, noting that while the aforementioned facts are relevant to whether or not the plaintiff merely forgot to pay for the cigarettes, they were wholly irrelevant to whether the detective had probable cause to prosecute Mrs. Gustafson for shoplifting. Holman noted that the removal of merchandise from a store without paying is generally held as probable cause for shoplifting, as cited in the case of Delp v. Zapp's Drug and Variety Stores. Under this ruling, he argues that the defendant possessed probable cause.

Sister Kate Katherine Mary Clutterbuck CSC MBE (October 1860 in Wiltshire, England ‚Äì 31 July 1946 in Nedlands, Western Australia), usually known as Sister Kate, was an Anglican nun who pioneered a cottage home system for looking after orphan babies and children in Western Australia. She later became well known for her work with Indigenous Australian children who were selected according to a criterion of skin colour and sent to her homes to groom the young \\"nearly white\\" children for absorption into the white community. These children would later be described as part of the Stolen Generation. Clutterbuck was the daughter of well-off parents, Captain Clutterbuck and his wife. She was awarded an Order of the British Empire (Member of the Civil Division), on 1 January 1934, for her services to disadvantaged children. In December 2006, the West Australian newspaper published a list entitled the \\"100 Most Influential Western Australians\\" which included Clutterbuck. The list was developed by a committee including several eminent Western Australian historians. Orphanage career In 1881 Clutterbuck joined the Community of the Sisters of the Church, a Church of England order founded in London in 1870 by Mother Emily Ayckbowm. Now referred to as \\"Sister Kate\\", Clutterbuck worked with orphans in the London slums for 17 years until 1901 when she and several other sisters were sent to Western Australia to establish a girls' school and orphanage. She arrived in Western Australia in December 1901 with Sister Sarah and 22 orphaned English children aged between 6 and 10 in her care. While the other sisters of her order set about the establishment of founding a church school (now Perth College), Clutterbuck and Sister Sarah set out to establish a home for orphaned babies. Temporary premises in William Street, Perth were used while a permanent children's home in the country was located. The nuns purchased a block at Parkerville in the Darling Range. Clutterbuck took up residence in 1903 with eight children in an old hut and bark roofed barn which she named The League of Charity Homes for Waifs and Stray Babies and which was later expanded to become Parkerville Children's Home. Forty-five children were being fostered by 1905 and, thanks to a benefactor, Walter Padbury, a large stone nursery was built. Other improvements included a water tank and of land partially planted with fruit trees as well as a carriage and horse. The state government provided some funding and by 1911, 100 children were living there. Another two sisters were recruited from England and the building were extended to include a dining-room, schoolhouse and kitchen. For nearly 30 years Clutterbuck ran the home where over 800 disadvantaged children passed through her care. In 1927 the home was taken over by the Diocese of Perth and in 1930 she retired at the age of 70. She was awarded an MBE the following year. Parkerville continues to operate today as Parkerville Children and Youth Care, providing \\"a range of primary, secondary and tertiary services.\\" The goals of these services are to \\"protect, care, advocate and promote recovery for children and young people who have experienced trauma from abuse, to support families and to work with the community to prevent child abuse.\\" A small river in the vicinity of the home is named Clutterbuck Creek. Return from retirement and the Stolen Generations Friend and associate Ruth Lefroy shared an interest in the welfare of Aboriginal children. In 1932, Lefroy purchased a property in Neville Street, Bayswater called the Children's Cottage Home which was run by Clutterbuck. Another house used as a holiday home was acquired in Beach Street, Mosman Park. The home was funded by government subsidies from the Native Welfare and Child Welfare Departments, as well as f√™tes, jumble sales, donations and street collections. At this time A. O. Neville, the government Chief Protector of Aboriginals, was the architect of an official scheme which oversaw the care, custody and education of Aboriginal and half-caste children under 16 years in the state. The scheme's purpose was to integrate young and part Aboriginal children into white society by separating them from their families. The process by which the separation was done has been widely condemned since a report entitled Bringing Them Home was published in 1997 following a federal government inquiry. These people are now known as the Stolen Generations. As part of the scheme, Neville directed young Aboriginal children and babies into the Children's Cottage Home run by Clutterbuck. In June 1934, Clutterbuck and Ruth Lefroy relocated the home with ten school-aged children to a new site on Railway Street (now Treasure Road), Queens Park. The new six-roomed home was named \\"Myola\\" and had been purpose built with the help of private sponsorship. Due to a measles epidemic, the cottage was soon extended to create a ward where sick children could be isolated and nursed. In 1935 a kitchen and a second cottage, \\"Friendly Cottage\\", were built on the site to accommodate younger children. At this time Queens Park was a relatively undeveloped suburb although the cottage was well located with a school and train station nearby. Towards the end of 1936, Neville began negotiations on behalf of Clutterbuck for the purchase of land immediately adjacent to the home. An adjoining 5.25 acres (2 hectares) was acquired at a cost of ¬£85 in January 1937 using funds donated by a benefactor. The same person also donated funds to extend the second cottage and to build a third cottage and a chapel. This third cottage was known as \\"Nursery Cottage\\" and the chapel was named the \\"Chapel of the Guardian Angel\\". Neville supposedly reproached Sister Kate for building the chapel, suggesting that the funds should have been spent on the children. Church services, Sunday School and daily prayers were conducted in the new chapel on a regular basis. A morning service conducted by Sister Kate was conducted each morning. The chapel was very important to Sister Kate: according to Vera Whittington She refused to have the building dedicated, believing that its non-denominational status would encourage patronage by the children, and it was not until after her death in February 1948 that Anglican Archbishop Moline dedicated the chapel. In 1937, fund-raising by a group known as the 'Virgillians', led by Mary Durack, enabled further development of the site and in 1938‚Äì41 a kindergarten and another cottage were constructed. With the onset of World War 2 most of the children were evacuated to the Duke of York Hotel at Greenbushes. Some children required specialised medical attention and attendance at Perth hospitals however, and so Ruth Lefroy purchased a cottage at Roleystone. After the war, the Roleystone property was sold and the proceeds used to pay for the construction of 'Memorial cottage'. In 1946, funds from the Lotteries Commission helped build 'Gran's Cottage' (as she was then known) as a private residence for Sister Kate. Soon after however, she died suddenly at Tresillian Hospital in Nedlands at the age of 86. Most of her foster-children were with her from babyhood to maturity: they called her 'Mum', and in later years 'Gran'. She was not a big woman and was said to have an English complexion, and radiated kindliness with a quiet strength that won respect and confidence from young and old. Always full of sympathy, she had a kindly understanding nature and was always able to offer advice for the children which she treated as her own. Posthumous events A committee then administered the home, with the position of Superintendent Matron taken over by Ruth Lefroy. The Queens Park complex, which by this time comprised seven cottages as well as the chapel and kindergarten, became known as \\"Sister Kate's Children's Cottages\\" in recognition of her work. Ruth Lefroy died in 1953 and her will made provision for the ownership of the property to be donated to the Presbyterian Church, now part of the Uniting Church in Australia. Dean Collard was appointed Director of the Cottages in August 1987. In 1988, the cottages were renamed as \\"Manguri\\". The organisation continues today to provide Aboriginal child-care services.

He uses a diverse range of performance styles and skills. He holds a diploma in New Circus from Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology's Circus School where he has taught juggling for two years. His interest in the phenomenon of traditional circus freak shows and influences such as the Jim Rose Circus and the Tokyo Shock Boys led to experiments with shock comedy, earning him his first Pulp Comedy appearance, the Best New Face award for the 2001 season, and he was called ‚ÄòPrince of Cringe‚Äô from Truth and TV Extra magazine. Until 2001, Wills was active in the Christchurch entertainment scene, appearing at balls, private functions and corporate events; running weekly comedy nights and appearing on local television. In 2002, he moved to Auckland to become a resident comedian at the casino in SkyCity Auckland, where he had a weekly show, the NCB Comedy Hour, blending circus and vaudeville styles. In 2008, Wills took his show The Boy With Tape On His Face to the Melbourne Comedy Festival, where it received critical acclaim. After Melbourne, he moved to London, appearing as a modern mime and wearing the traditional striped shirt.

Other cheeses such as blue and Swiss are occasionally used in its preparation, and additional vegetable ingredients are sometimes used. The word \\"cheese slaw\\" is a portmanteau of the words cheese and coleslaw. Its origins can be traced to Townsville in far north Queensland, Australia, and to Broken Hill, New South Wales, Australia. It is a common and popular dish in Broken Hill restaurants and households. Cheese slaw is also consumed in some areas of the United States. Overview Cheese slaw is prepared using grated cheese, crumbled or cubed cheese, grated carrot, and a mayonnaise dressing. Cheese slaw is very similar to some coleslaw recipes, but is distinguished by the inclusion of cheese. Cheddar cheese is typically used in the salad's preparation, although other cheeses such as blue and Swiss are sometimes used. It often does not contain cabbage, as per coleslaw, although cabbage is occasionally used. Cheese slaw may contain other vegetables, such as chives, spring onions, shallots, parsley, and broccoli. In the United States, cheese slaw is sometimes prepared using blue cheese, and is sometimes used as a hot dog dressing. In addition to the base ingredients, cabbage is also sometimes used in U.S. versions of the dish. U.S. versions have also been prepared using blue cheese salad dressing, instead of mayonnaise. History The origin of cheese slaw has been somewhat disputed. Cheese slaw dates to at least 1939 in Australia, when a recipe for it was printed in the Townsville Daily Bulletin, a newspaper published in Townsville, Queensland. The recipe was for a \\"ham and cheese slaw\\", and included shredded cabbage, cubed cheese, julienne ham, mayonnaise, lemon juice, and mustard. Cheese slaw recipes were also published in the Australian Women's Weekly, a monthly women's magazine, in 1946 and 1966. Some people claim that cheese slaw originated in Broken Hill, New South Wales. Cheese slaw is found extensively in Broken Hill, where it is served in restaurants, prepared in households, and has been stated to be \\"ingrained in the local diet\\". It has been served in Broken Hill cafes and milk bars since the second half of the 20th century. In Broken Hill, it is typically served as a side dish. Some people in Broken Hill top barbecued chicken with cheese slaw, which causes the cheese to melt.

LOREE: 1881-1981 by Laila Storch, Journal of the International Double Reed Society, Number 9, 1981. Retrieved 2007-4-11 The firm of Triebert, which was the dominant oboe-making concern in mid-19th century France, fell to pieces with the death of sole proprietor Fr√©d√©ric Triebert in 1879. By 1882 it had changed management thrice and was eventually sold to the mass-maker Gautrot, itself purchased in 1884 by Couesnon. Fr√©d√©ric Triebert‚Äôs last foreman, Fran√ßois Lor√©e (1835-1902), formed his own oboe making company in 1881, carrying on Triebert‚Äôs work and tradition. Acquiring the contract for supplying oboes to the Paris Conservatory in 1882, Fran√ßois Lor√©e limited his atelier to making oboes and English horns. There is ample reason to believe that the professor of oboe at the Paris Conservatoire, Georges Gillet, encouraged Lor√©e to set up his own shop. The facts that Lor√©e acquired the Conservatoire contract before making a single oboe under his own name and that he collaborated with Gillet on the System 6 oboe, suggest such a plan. Until the mid-20th century, Fran√ßois Lor√©e was almost without rival as a maker of artist-quality French oboes. In 1906, working with Georges Gillet, Fran√ßois‚Äô son Adolphe Lucien Lor√©e modified the System 6 oboe to the 6bis (plateau) oboe that is almost universally used today. Even now Lor√©e remains the dominant French oboe maker. The overwhelming influence of French conservatory-trained oboists in American orchestras of the 1900s led to Lor√©e‚Äôs dominating the American market for most of that century; rare indeed is the American oboist who has not owned a Loree oboe. Further details of the Loree-Triebert relationship are in an article by Robert Howe. The study on Triebert by Tula Giannini, PhD musicologist, sheds light on his workshop and personal life.

It primarily connects small towns in the central Piedmont region of the state. The route is a two-lane road for most of its length, but the segment between Winston-Salem and Thomasville is being upgraded to a divided 4-lane highway, as it is a major route between the two cities. The central segment of NC 109 passes through the Uwharrie Mountains and the Uwharrie National Forest. Route description NC 62 western terminus in Thomasville North Carolina Highway 109 begins at the North Carolina-South Carolina border north of Ruby, South Carolina. NC 109 intersects its first road, Long Pine Church Road (Secondary Road 1220 or SR 1220) about a mile north of the border. NC 109 continues north from there to Wadesboro. NC 109 enters Wadesboro on Camden Road. The road intersects NC 742 and runs a short concurrency with the road. In downtown Wadesboro NC 109 intersects US 52/US 74/NC 742. NC 109 continues north from the intersection out of Wadesboro along N Greene Street. As the road goes further to the north it crosses the Pee Dee River into Richmond County. After crossing into Richmond County NC 902 intersects Grassy Island Road (SR 1148). The road passes through the rural area going almost directly north towards Mount Gilead. The last intersection along NC 109 in Richmond County is with Jack Currie Road, right before the road heads into Montgomery County. NC 109 enters rural Montgomery County and continues towards the north. When the road enters Mount Gilead on Wadesboro Boulevard it intersects NC 731 and then bypasses downtown. As NC 109 comes around the north side of Mount Gilead it intersects NC 73 and then leaves the town. About a mile after leaving Mount Gilead the road enters the Uwharrie National Forest. NC 109 intersects NC 24/NC 27 inside the national forest. NC 109 runs a concurrency with NC 24/NC 27 until Troy. In Troy NC 109 turns left to continue back north along N Bilhen Street. NC 109 crosses the Uwharrie River before going through Eldorado and entering Randolph County. NC 109 enters and leaves Randolph County within a half a mile and then enter Davidson County. History =North Carolina Highway 515= North Carolina Highway 515 (NC 515) was established as a new primary routing from NC 51, in Mount Gilead, to NC 74, to the northwest. In 1928, NC 515 was extended south to US 74/NC 20 in Wadesboro. The road was extended to its final southern terminus at the South Carolina state line. In 1934, most of NC 515 was renumbered to NC 109\\\\. The only part that was not renumbered to NC 109 was the segment from NC 74 to NC 51; which became part of NC 73\\\\. Future NCDOT conducted a project study to improve the safety of NC 109 between Thomasville and Winston-Salem in 2012. Various improvements were identified, including the use of the Superstreet concept.

Miriam Lee was born in China in 1926, but left the mainland in 1949. In China, she was a nurse-midwife before becoming an acupuncturist. Lee lived through the Second Sino-Japanese War. After leaving China, she lived in Singapore for 17 years before coming to the United States. When she arrived in California, acupuncture was illegal. So Lee worked on a factory assembly line and gave treatments quietly out of her home. Later, she shared a space with a supportive medical doctor.Miriam Lee - Blue Poppy Press In 1974, Lee was arrested for practicing medicine without a license. At her trial, her patients protested her arrest, claiming their right to the only medicine that had helped them. Within a few days, acupuncture was legally made an experimental procedure by Governor Ronald Reagan. In 1976, Governor Jerry Brown signed the legislation that legalized acupuncture in California. Lee was one of California's first licensed acupuncturists holding California Acupuncture License Number 6 issued October 19, 1976. She received her O.M.D. from the San Francisco College of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine on June 10, 1984. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Lee was the acupuncture teacher of probably 70% of practitioners working in Northern California. She used a special set of points based on the work of one of her teachers, Tung Ching Chang, known as the \\"Master Tung Magic Points.\\" These are published in a book by Blue Poppy Press. During the height of her practice, she would see up to 10 patients an hour and worked 80 hours a week. She popularized a 10-point protocol in her book, Insights of A Senior Acupuncturist. Lee describes a combination of points that have wide application: ST36, SP6, LI4, LI11, and LU7.Acupuncture Points - A Few Commonly Used Acupuncture Points She also popularized the Master Tung Ching Chang's Magic Points, a nontraditional point system. The Acupuncture Association of America was founded in 1980 and run by Lee until 1998, when she retired and passed the care of AAA over to her student, Susan Johnson. The purpose of the organization is to promote public acupuncture education, provide continuing education for licensed practitioners, to engage in legislative advocacy, and to promote acupuncture research. Lee died on June 24, 2009, a few weeks after suffering a stroke.(1 July 2009).

Suddenly, the evil robots led by Hun-Dred blast their way into his house. Coptor fires on the evil robots, but is defeated. The scientist is abducted by the evil robots for his research on putting human brains into robots. Hun-Dred and his crew would like Dr. Fury to do this for the evil Nazgar, who created trouble for the scientist's planet nearly two- thousand years ago. Ten years later, a repaired Coptor and Dr. Fury's son (Mark Fury) along with new robots like Maxx Steele created by Mark go on a mission to find his father. The final battle occurs in Nazgar's headquarters. Nazgar (whose brain is now in a robot body) seemingly escapes, Hun-Dred and a laser gun meant to wreak havoc on the planet are destroyed by Maxx Steele and Dr. Fury is saved. =Cast= * Michael Bell - Cruel * Rodger Bumpass - Mark Fury * Arthur Burghardt - Nazgar, Sentinel * Peter Cullen - Coptor, Vulgar * Ron Feinberg - Hun-Dred * David Mendenhall - Jason Fury * Robert Ridgely - Councilman Frost * Neil Ross - Blazer * John Stephenson - Dr. Richard Fury * B.J.

Life Roman Danylak was born in Toronto, Canada on December 29, 1930. He was ordained to the Catholic priesthood in 1957 at St. Josaphat's Seminary Chapel in Rome and ministered to Ukrainian Catholics in Canada. He received a licentiate of sacred theology from the Pontifical Urbaniana University and a doctorate of canon and civil law from the Pontifical Lateran University. From 1973-1990, Father Danylak served as a consultor to the Pontifical Commission for the Revision of Canon Law for the Eastern Churches. In 1992, while serving as the rector of St. Josaphat Cathedral and chancellor of the eparchal chancery, he was appointed Apostolic administrator sede plena of the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Toronto and titular bishop of Nyssa by Pope John Paul II. His appointment proved controversial, as the incumbent bishop, 81-year-old Isidore Borecky, refused to retire even though he had passed the mandatory retirement age of 75 established by canon law. It was also rumored that Borecky had requested a coadjutor or auxiliary bishop, not an administrator, and that Father Danylak had not been nominated for the position by the Ukrainian Synod. After six years of conflict between the two bishops, Bishop Lubomyr Husar, Apostolic administrator of Lviv, negotiated a resolution whereby Borecky retired and Danylak was reassigned to \\"special responsibilities in Rome\\", resulting in the vacancy of the Toronto eparchy effective June 24, 1998. Bishop Cornelius Pasichny of Saskatoon was appointed the new bishop on July 1 of that year. In Rome, Danylak served as a canon of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. Danylak died at age 81 in Toronto on October 7, 2012.\\"Roman Danylak\\" (obituary), Toronto Star, October 9, 2012  Views  During his retirement in Italy, Danylak supported certain claims by individuals to have seen visions of Jesus and Mary, claims about which the Holy See or the bishop holding responsibility as ordinary had expressed reservations or an explicitly negative judgement: *The Garabandal apparitionsLetter by Bishop Danylak on \\"The Church and Garabandal\\" *Maria Valtorta's Poem of the Man God\\"Maria Valtorta, Her Life and Work\\" by Bishop Roman Danylak Testimonial letter of Bishop Danylak Letter of 13 February 2002 from Bishop Danylak Protest letter to EWTN * Alleged miracle in Naju, KoreaKwangju Archbishop Gives Directives On Naju EventsBishop Roman Danylak, \\"The Eucharistic Miracle of Naju (The Sacred Heart of the Divine Victim)\\" References Category:Bishops of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church Category:Canadian bishops Category:Canon law jurists Category:1930 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Canadian Eastern Catholics ","title":"Roman Danylak"},{"id":"10548675","text":"Flag of the Greek Orthodox Church Double-headed eagle emblem of John VIII Palaiologos (r. 1425‚Äì1448).

The BN point of sale (POS) System allows merchants to accept the automated teller machine (ATM) cards of any active BancNet member bank as payment for goods or services and obliges BN to settle the transaction as early as the following banking day through a direct deposit to a settlement account with any member bank. Acceptance of CUP cards is limited to SM Prime Holdings, Inc.'s Department Store, Supermarket, Hypermarket, Super Sale, Watson's, Sports Central, SM Appliance, Toy Kingdom, and select Surplus Stores. Systems components The service has two major components: the infrastructure and the support services. BancNet deploys credit authorization terminals with requisite supplies, provides store signage (or point of sale display), maintains toll free connections for provincial merchants (PLDT, Innove (Globe Telecom) and Digitel) and performs actual transactions settlement (finance) (through the BN depository bank). To support the installations, BN provides maintenance, cashier orientation, and a 24 x 7 merchant helpdesk services, as well as daily electronic data processing, like transactions reporting and reconciliation. In each accredited retail location, a terminal is installed. The terminal also connects to the member banks through the BancNet switch using the public phone system. The operation is rudimentary: the cashier swipes a customer's ATM card on the terminal and keys in payment amount. The cardholder then selects his bank account and keys in the ATM Personal identification number (PIN). If the requested amount is successfully debited from the customer's account, receipts will be printed for both the customer and retailer. BancNet does not charge rental or membership fees for retail merchants; instead, it charges interchange fees or a merchant discount rate for every successful debit transaction coursed through its system. Currently, BancNet's average merchant rate is about 1.0% net, while the average Visa/MasterCard credit and signature debit card merchant rate is about 2.5%, exclusive of the 1/2 of 1% creditable withholding tax. Some merchant sectors, such as food wholesalers and gasoline stations, have special reduced rates to accommodate business needs and profit margins. BancNet introduced the BancNet Rewards Points program on August 15, 2009, the first points-based rewards system exclusively for debit purchases in the country. Every Php 25 in spend using an ATM debit or prepaid card of a member bank earned the cardholder 1 point. 2,000 points were needed to redeem the cash rebate of Php 100. The Rewards Points program ran through September 15, 2011. History The first merchant accreditation contract was signed on May 6, 1994 with Rustan's Corp. but the service was first made available later that year at the Robinsons Galleria Supermarket. Given this was the second payment service enabled by BN (with Bill (payment) on the ATM launched the year before), the brand \\"BancNet Payment System (BPS)\\"was coined at around the same time. It was decided in 2006 to do away with the independent brand given that the name BancNet has since developed a market cachet. In this way, the new marketing tagline \\"Pay Bills.Buy Things.Transfer Funds.\\" supplements the official corporate identifier of \\"Non-Stop Banking Network\\" on marketing materiel. The primary reason for the launch of the service was to become the terminal provider of the credit card operations of the member banks. At the time, Phil Commercial & International Bank (PCIB) - Bankard, Citibank, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation, and Unicard (Metrobank) were major issuers of both branded and proprietary credit cards. In the early 1990s, there was a dramatic increase in credit card issuance and the member banks needed a way to expand without expending much capital. The model of shared ATM operations was then applied to the POS. Debit was treated as a pleasant side-effect of the terminal operations. The member banks saw an opportunity to expand even faster in 2000 when talks for a broader-based consortium were started. The objective was ostensibly to compete against what was then seen as the hegemony of Equitable Card Network, Inc. (ECNI) in terminal operations. Negotiations went far enough that BN invested in office space in 139 Corporate Center. The consortium arrangement fell through in 2003 when foreign issuers backed out. BN developed a better appreciation for the potential of debit especially at the turn of the new century. Growth has averaged 68% since launch, peaking at 71% between 2000 and 2001. A marketing/business development organization was created in 2002, with a product manager coming on board in 2003. The BN Bills Payment facility has been extended on the POS since late 2007. To date, forty six of the more than seventy billers available on the ATM are also on the POS channel. This is currently in use for member banks but BN may offer terminals to biller partners and merchants as their in-house collection service. Cash withdrawal on the POS was launched in early 2008. The BN POS terminal may now be used to authorize cash withdrawals at key merchants like M. Lhuillier, a local pawnshop with over 1,000 locations nationwide. Cardholders will be charged P10.00 for every withdrawal; the merchant-partner may also impose an additional \\"convenience fee\\" for the transaction. Competitive landscape It is easy to generalize that BancNet, Expressnet EPS, and Megalink Fastlink are direct competitors. In reality though there is very little overlap in their respective constituencies given that 50% to 60% of all ATM cards issued in the country are for payroll. Cash is the true competition of electronic payment systems. According to a study by Intuition, commissioned by VISA Asia-Pacific, cash still accounts for 80% of all transactions in the region. This is in contrast to the situation in the United States where debit transactions outnumber cash purchases with the former accounting for 35% of total buy. BancNet signed a Memorandum of Agreement with both Banco de Oro (a member bank of both Expressnet and Megalink) and Bank of the Philippine Islands (operator of Expressnet) for terminal sharing in 2009. However, internal settlement arrangements within each consortium are followed despite the terminal arrangements; e.g., BancNet POS transactions may still only be settled with a member bank. But this stipulation is reportedly under review as the BancNet POS is now being considered for the collection requirements of government agencies and government controlled entities. In this case, a non-member bank acts as the depository while the BancNet treasury bank acts as the collecting bank.

The program officially began in spring 1943 on orders from U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt. Research continued following World War II as the U.S. built up a large stockpile of biological agents and weapons. Over the course of its 27-year history, the program weaponized and stockpiled the following seven bio-agents (and pursued basic research on many more): *Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) *Francisella tularensis (tularemia) *Brucella spp (brucellosis) *Coxiella burnetii (Q-fever) *Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) *Botulinum toxin (botulism) *Staphylococcal enterotoxin B Throughout its history, the U.S. bioweapons program was secret. It was later revealed that laboratory and field testing (some of the latter using simulants on non-consenting individuals) had been common. The official policy of the United States was first to deter the use of bio-weapons against U.S. forces and secondarily to retaliate if deterrence failed. In 1969, President Richard Nixon ended all offensive (i.e., non-defensive) aspects of the U.S. bio- weapons program. In 1975 the U.S. ratified both the 1925 Geneva Protocol and the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC)‚Äîinternational treaties outlawing biological warfare. Recent U.S. biodefense programs, however, have raised concerns that the U.S. may be pursuing research that is outlawed by the United Nations. History =Early history (1918‚Äì1941)= Initial interest in any form of biological warfare came at the close of World War I. The only agent the U.S. tested was the toxin ricin, a product of the castor plant. The U.S. conducted tests concerning two methods of ricin dissemination: the first, which involved adhering the toxin to shrapnel for delivery by artillery shell, was successful; the second, delivering an aerosol cloud of ricin, was proven less successful in these tests. Neither delivery method was perfected before the war in Europe ended.Smart, Jeffery K. Medical Aspects of Chemical and Biological Warfare: Chapter 2 ‚Äì History of Chemical and Biological Warfare: An American Perspective, (PDF: p. 14), Borden Institute, Textbooks of Military Medicine, PDF via Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base. Retrieved January 3, 2009. In the early 1920s suggestions that the U.S. began a biological weapons program were coming from within the Chemical Warfare Service (CWS). Chief of the CWS, Amos Fries, decided that such a program would not be \\"profitable\\" for the U.S. Japan's Shiro Ishii began promoting biological weapons during the 1920s and toured biological research facilities worldwide, including in the United States. Though Ishii concluded that the U.S. was developing a bio-weapons programs, he was incorrect. In fact, Ishii concluded that each major power he visited was developing a bio-weapons program. As the interwar period continued, the United States did not emphasize biological weapons development or research. While the U.S. was spending very little time on biological weapons research, its future allies and enemies in the upcoming second World War were researching the potential of biological weapons as early as 1933., =World War II (1941‚Äì45)= Despite the World War I-era interest in ricin, as World War II erupted, the United States Army still maintained the position that biological weapons were, for the most part, impractical. Other nations, notably France, Japan and the United Kingdom, thought otherwise and had begun their own biological weapons programs.Garrett, Laurie. Betrayal of Trust: The Collapse of Global Public Health, (Google Books), Oxford University Press, 2003, pp. 340‚Äì41, (). Thus, as late as 1942 the U.S. had no biological weapons capabilities. Initial interest in biological weapons by the Chemical Warfare Service began in 1941.Croddy, Weapons of Mass Destruction, p. 303. That fall, U.S. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson requested that the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) undertake consideration of U.S. biological warfare. He wrote to Dr. Frank B. Jewett, then president of the NAS: > Because of the dangers that might confront this country from potential > enemies employing what may be broadly described as biological warfare, it > seems advisable that investigations be initiated to survey the present > situation and the future possibilities. I am therefore, asking if you will > undertake the appointment of an appropriate committee to survey all phases > of this matter. Your organization already has before it a request from The > Surgeon General for the appointment of a committee by the Division of > Medical Sciences of the National Research Council to examine one phase of > the matter.Covert, Norman M. (2000), \\"A History of Fort Detrick, Maryland\\", > 4th Edition: 2000. In response the NAS formed a committee, the War Bureau of Consultants (WBC), which issued a report on the subject in February 1942. The report, among other items, recommended the research and development of an offensive biological weapons program. The British, and the research undertaken by the WBC, pressured the U.S. to begin biological weapons research and development and in November 1942 U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt officially approved an American biological weapons program. In response to the information provided by the WBC, Roosevelt ordered Stimson to form the War Research Service (WRS).Moreno, Jonathan D.. Undue Risk: Secret State Experiments on Humans, (Google Books), Routledge, 2001, pp. 44‚Äì46, (). Established within the Federal Security Agency, the WRS' stated purpose was to promote \\"public security and health\\", but, in reality, the WRS was tasked with coordinating and supervising the U.S. biological warfare program.Zilinskas, Raymond A. Biological Warfare, (Google Books), Lynne Rienner Publishers, Boulder, Colorado: 2000 pp. 228‚Äì30, (). In the spring of 1943 the U.S. Army Biological Warfare Laboratories were established at Fort (then Camp) Detrick in Maryland.Ryan, Jeffrey R. and Glarum, Jan F. Biosecurity and Bioterrorism: Containing and Preventing Biological Threats, (Google Books), Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, p. 14, ().Guillemin, Jeanne. Biological Warfare, p. 63. Though initially, under George Merck, the WRS contracted several universities to participate in the U.S. biological weapons program, the program became large quickly and before long it was under the full control of the CWS. By November 1943 the biological weapons facility at Detrick was completed, in addition, the United States constructed three other facilities - a biological agent production plant at Vigo County near Terre Haute, Indiana, a field-testing site on Horn Island in Mississippi, and another field site near Granite Peak in Utah. According to an official history of the period, \\"the elaborate security precautions taken [at Camp Detrick] were so effective that it was not until January 1946, 4 months after VJ Day, that the public learned of the wartime research in biological weapons\\".Clendenin, Lt. Col. Richard M. (1968), Science and Technology at Fort Detrick, 1943‚Äì1968; Technical Information Division. =Cold War (1947‚Äì1969)= Following World War II, the United States biological warfare program progressed into an effective, military-driven research and production program, covered in controversy and secrecy.David R. Franz, D.V.M., PH.D.; Cheryl D. Parrott; and Ernest T. Takafuji, M.D., M.P.H., \\"Chapter 19 -THE U.S. BIOLOGICAL WARFARE AND BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE PROGRAMS\\", Air University, n.d Production of U.S. biological warfare agents went from \\"factory-level to laboratory-level\\". By 1950 the principal U.S. bio-weapons facility was located at Camp Detrick in Maryland under the auspices of the Research and Engineering Division of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps.Whitby, Simon M. Biological Warfare Against Crops, (Google Books), Macmillan, 2002, pp. 104‚Äì08, 117, (). Most of the research and development was done there, while production and testing occurred at Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. Pine Bluff Arsenal began production of weapons-grade agents by 1954.Zubay, Geoffrey L. Agents of Bioterrorism: Pathogens and Their Weaponization, (Google Books), Columbia University Press, 2005, p. 132, (). From 1952‚Äì1954 the Chemical Corps maintained a biological weapons research and development facility at Fort Terry on Plum Island, New York.Guillemin, Jeanne. Biological Weapons, p. 96.Wheelis, Mark, et al. Deadly Cultures: Biological Weapons Since 1945, (Google Books), Harvard University Press, 2006 pp. 225‚Äì28, (). Fort Terry's focus was on anti-animal biological weapon research and development; the facility researched more than a dozen potential BW agents. From the end of World War II through the Korean War, the U.S. Army, the Chemical Corps and the U.S. Air Force all expanded their biological warfare programs significantly, especially concerning delivery systems. Throughout the cold war, the United States and the Soviet Union would combine to produce enough biological weapons to kill everyone on Earth.Judith Miller, Stephen Engelberg and William J. Broad, \\"U.S. Germ Warfare Research Pushes Treaty Limits\\", San Francisco State University, 2001 Another substantive expansion phase was during the Kennedy- Johnson years, after McNamara initiated Project 112 as a comprehensive initiative, starting in 1961. Despite an increase in testing, the readiness for biological warfare remained limited after this program. A 10 November 1969 report by the Interdepartmental Political-Military Group submitted its findings to the Nixon administration that the American BW capability was limited:2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/frus/nixon/e2/83586.htm Field testing of the biological weapons was completed covertly and successfully with simulants and agents dispersed over wide, open areas. The first American large-scale aerosol vulnerability test occurred in the San Francisco Bay Area in September 1950, using two types of bacteria (Bacillus globigii and Serratia marcescens) and fluorescent particles. Bacillus species were chosen in these tests because of their spore-forming abilities, and their similarities to Bacillus anthracis, a causing agent of anthrax. S. marcescens was used because it is easily identifiable from its red pigment. In 1966, the New York City Subway was contaminated with Bacillus globigii in an attempt to simulate the spreading of anthrax in a large urban population. More field tests involving pathogenic species were conducted at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah and anti- animal studies were conducted at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. At the time, many scientists disagreed with the creation of biological weapons. Theodor Rosebury, who previously worked as a supervisor at Camp Detrick, issued a warning against the development of biological weapons during the cold war. In 1945, Rosebury left Camp Detrick during a period of time when scientists could publish the results of their research. Rosebury published Peace or Pestilence? in 1949, which explained his views on why biological weapons should be banned by world powers. By the time his book was available, publications were becoming more restricted and the extent of the Soviet threat of biological weapons was being overstated by Congress and the media. In 1969, Harvard biologist Matthew Meselson argued that the biological warfare programs would eventually hurt US security because potential enemy nations could easily emulate these weapons. The general population remained uninformed of any breakthroughs concerning biological warfare. This included new production plants for anthrax, brucellosis, and anti-crop agents, as well as the development of the cluster bomb. The U.S. public was also unaware of ongoing studies, particularly the environmental and open-air experiments that were taking place. One of the more controversial experiments was conducted in 1951, when a disproportionate number of African Americans were exposed to the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, to see if they were more susceptible to infection. Some scientists reasoned that such knowledge would help them prepare a defense against a more deadly form of the fungus. The same year, workers at the Norfolk Supply Center in Norfolk, Virginia, were unknowingly exposed to Aspergillus fumigatus spores. Another case of human research was the biodefense medical research program, Operation Whitecoat. This decade-long experiment on volunteer Seventh Day Adventist servicemen exposed them to tularaemia via aerosols. They were then treated with antibiotics. The goal of the experiment, unknown to the volunteers, was to standardize tularaemia bomb- fill for attacks on civilian populations. In the 1960s, the U.S. changed its main approach from biological agents aimed to kill to those that would incapacitate. In 1964, research programs studied Enterotoxin type B, which can cause food poisoning. New research initiatives also included prophylaxis, the preventive treatment of diseases. Pathogens studied included the biological agents causing a myriad of diseases such as anthrax, glanders, brucellosis, melioidosis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Q fever, coccidioidomycosis, and other plant and animal pathogens. The Vietnam War brought public awareness to the U.S. biological weapons program. The use of chemicals, riot-control agents, and herbicides like Agent Orange drew international criticism, and negatively affected the U.S. public opinion on the development of biological weapons. Highly controversial human research programs and open air experiments were discovered. Jeanne Guillemin, wife of biologist Matthew Meselson, summarized the controversy:Dr. Robert A. Wampler, \\"THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION TO END U.S. BIOLOGICAL WARFARE PROGRAMS\\", National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 58, 2001 The Nixon administration felt an urgent need to respond to the growing negative perception of biological weapons. The realization that biological weapons may become the poor man's atom bomb also contributed to the end of the U.S. biological weapons program. Subsequently, President Nixon announced that the U.S. was unilaterally renouncing its biological warfare program, ultimately signing the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention in 1972.Andr√© Richardt, Marc-Michael Blum Decontamination of Warfare Agents: Enzymatic Methods for the Removal of B/C Weapons, Wiley- VCH, 2008, pp. 5‚Äì6, =End of the program (1969‚Äì1973)= President Richard M. Nixon issued his \\"Statement on Chemical and Biological Defense Policies and Programs\\" on November 25, 1969 in a speech from Fort Detrick. The statement ended, unconditionally, all U.S. offensive biological weapons programs. Nixon noted that biological weapons were unreliableGraham, Thomas. Disarmament Sketches: Three Decades of Arms Control and International Law, (Google Books), University of Washington Press, 2002, pp. 21‚Äì30, (). and stated:Miller, pp. 61‚Äì64. > The United States shall renounce the use of lethal biological agents and > weapons, and all other methods of biological warfare. The United States will > confine its biological research to defensive measures such as immunization > and safety measures. In his speech Nixon called his move \\"unprecedented\\"; and it was in fact the first review of the U.S. biological warfare program since 1954.Guillemin, Jeanne. Biological Weapons, pp. 122‚Äì27. Despite the lack of review, the biological warfare program had increased in cost and size since 1961; when Nixon ended the program the budget was $300 million annually.Cirincione, Joseph, et al. Deadly Arsenals, p. 212. Nixon's statement confined all biological weapons research to defensive-only and ordered the destruction of the existing U.S. biological arsenal.Mauroni, Albert J. America's Struggle with Chemical-Biological Weapons, (Google Books), Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000, pp. 49‚Äì60, (). U.S. biological weapons stocks were destroyed over the next few years. A $12 million disposal plan was undertaken at Pine Bluff Arsenal,Mangold, Tom. Plague Wars: The Terrifying Reality of Biological Warfare, (Google Books), Macmillan, 1999, pp. 54‚Äì57, (). where all U.S. anti- personnel biological agents were stored. That plan was completed in May 1972 and included decontamination of facilities at Pine Bluff. Other agents, including anti-crop agents such as wheat stem rust, were stored at Beale Air Force Base and Rocky Mountain Arsenal. These anti-crop agents, along with agents at Fort Detrick used for research purposes were destroyed in March 1973. Budget history From the onset of the U.S. biological weapons program in 1943 through the end of World War II the United States spent $400 million on biological weapons, mostly on research and development.Guillemin, Biological Weapons, pp. 71‚Äì73. The budget for fiscal year 1966 was $38 million.Smart, Jeffery K.

Retrieved September 2, 2010. When Nixon ended the U.S. bio-weapons program it represented the first review of the U.S. biological warfare program since 1954. Despite the lack of review, the biological warfare program had increased in cost and size since 1961; when Nixon ended the program the budget was $300 million annually. Geneva Protocol and BWC The 1925 Geneva Protocol, ratified by most major powers in the 1920s and 30s, had still not been ratified by the United States at the dawn of World War II. Among the Protocol's provisions was a ban on bacteriological warfare.O'Brien, Neil. An American Editor in Early Revolutionary China: John William Powell and the China Weekly/monthly Review, (Google Books), Routledge, 2003, pp. 217‚Äì19, (). The Geneva Protocol had encountered opposition in the U.S. Senate, in part due to strong lobbying against it by the Chemical Warfare Service, and it was never brought to the floor for a vote when originally introduced. Regardless, on June 8, 1943 President Roosevelt affirmed a no-first-use policy for the United States concerning biological weapons. Even with Roosevelt's declaration opposition to the Protocol remained strong; in 1949 the Protocol was among several old treaties returned to President Harry S. Truman unratified. When Nixon ended the U.S. bio-weapons program in 1969 he also announced that he would resubmit the Geneva Protocol to the U.S. Senate. This was a move Nixon was considering as early as July 1969. The announcement included language that indicated the Nixon administration was moving toward an international agreement on an outright ban on bio-weapons. Thus, the Nixon administration became the world's leading anti-biological weapons voice calling for an international treaty. The Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee was discussing a British draft of a biological weapons treaty which the United Nations General Assembly approved in 1968 and that NATO supported. These arms control talks would eventually lead to the Biological Weapons Convention, the international treaty outlawing biological warfare.Carter, April, (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute). Success and Failure in Arms Control Negotiations, (Google Books), Oxford University Press, 1989, p. 298, (). Prior to the Nixon announcement only Canada supported the British draft. Beginning in 1972, the Soviet Union, United States and more than 100 other countries signed the BWC. The United States ratified the Geneva Protocol in 1975.\\"Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare\\", via Federation of American Scientists, April 29, 1975.

Agents studied and weaponized When the U.S. biological warfare program ended in 1969 it had developed six mass-produced, battle-ready biological weapons in the form of agents that cause anthrax, tularemia, brucellosis, Q-fever, VEE, and botulism. In addition staphylococcal enterotoxin B was produced as an incapacitating agent.Croddy, Eric C. and Hart, C. Perez- Armendariz J., Chemical and Biological Warfare, (Google Books), Springer, 2002, pp. 30‚Äì31, ().

Retrieved January 3, 2009. Besides the numerous pathogens that afflict human beings, the U.S. had developed an arsenal of anti-agriculture biological agents. These included rye stem rust spores (stored at Edgewood Arsenal, 1951-1957), wheat stem rust spores (stored at the same facility 1962-1969), and the causative agent of rice blast (stored at Fort Detrick 1965-1966). A U.S. facility at Fort Terry focused primarily on anti-animal biological agents. The first agent that was a candidate for development was foot and mouth disease (FMD). Besides FMD, five other top- secret biological weapons projects were commissioned on Plum Island.Carroll, Michael C. Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret Plum Island Germ Laboratory, (Google Books), HarperCollins, 2004, pp. 45‚Äì48, (). The other four programs researched included RVF, rinderpest, African swine fever, plus eleven miscellaneous exotic animal diseases. The eleven miscellaneous pathogens were: Blue tongue virus, bovine influenza, bovine virus diarrhea (BVD), fowl plague, goat pneumonitis, mycobacteria, \\"N\\" virus, Newcastle disease, sheep pox, Teschers disease, and vesicular stomatitis. Work on delivery systems for the U.S. bioweapons arsenal led to the first mass- produced biological weapon in 1952, the M33 cluster bomb.Croddy, Weapons of Mass Destruction, p. 75. The M33's sub-munition, the pipe-bomb-like cylindrical M114 bomb, was also completed and battle-ready by 1952. Other delivery systems researched and at least partially developed during the 1950s included the E77 balloon bomb and the E86 cluster bomb. The peak of U.S. biological weapons delivery system development came during the 1960s. Production of cluster bomb submunitions began to shift from cylindrical to spherical bomblets, which had a larger coverage area.Kirby, Reid. \\"The CB Battlefield Legacy: Understanding the Potential Problem of Clustered CB Weapons \\", Army Chemical Review, pp. 25‚Äì29, July‚ÄìDecember 2006.

Allegations in 1962 held that CIA operatives had contaminated a shipment of sugar while it was in storage in Cuba. Also in 1962, a Canadian agricultural technician assisting the Cuban government claimed he was paid $5,000 to infect Cuban turkeys with the deadly Newcastle disease.It is known that the viral causal agent for Newcastle disease was researched for use as a weapon by the U.S. bio-weapons program. See: \\"Global Guide to Bioweapons\\". Though the technician later claimed he had just pocketed the money, many Cubans and some US citizens believed a clandestinely administered biological weapons agent was responsible for a subsequent outbreak of the disease in Cuban turkeys.Blum, William. Killing Hope: U.S. Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II, ( Internet Archive), Zed Books Ltd., 2003, pp. 188‚Äì90, (). In 1971 the first serious outbreak of African Swine Fever in the Western Hemisphere occurred in Cuba. The Cuban government alleged that U.S. covert biological warfare was responsible for this outbreak, which led to the preemptive slaughter of 500,000 pigs. The outbreak was labeled the \\"most alarming event\\" of 1971 by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization. Six years after the event, the newspaper Newsday, citing untraceable sources, claimed that anti- Castro saboteurs, with at least the tacit backing of U.S. Central Intelligence Agency officials, introduced African swine fever virus into Cuba six weeks before the outbreak in 1971, to destabilize the Cuban economy and encourage domestic opposition to Fidel Castro. The virus was allegedly delivered to the operatives from an army base in the Panama Canal Zone by an unnamed U.S. intelligence source. Evidence linking these incidents to biological warfare has not been confirmed. Accusations have continued to come out of Havana charging U.S. use of bio-weapons on the island, after the official end of the US biological weapons program in 1973. The Cuban government blamed the U.S. for a 1981 outbreak of dengue fever that sickened more than 300,000. Dengue, a vector-borne disease usually carried by mosquitoes, killed 158 people that year in Cuba, including 101 children under 15. Tensions between the two countries, coupled with confirmed U.S. research into entomological warfare during the 1950s, made these charges seem not implausible to some people. Experimentation and testing =Entomological testing= The United States seriously researched the potential of entomological warfare (EW) during the Cold War. EW is a specific type of biological warfare which aims to use insects as weapon, either directly or through their potential to act as vectors. During the 1950s the United States conducted a series of field tests using entomological weapons. Operation Big Itch, in 1954, was designed to test munitions loaded with uninfected fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis).Croddy, Weapons of Mass Destruction, p. 304. In May 1955 over 300,000 yellow fever mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti) were dropped over parts of the U.S. state of Georgia to determine if the air-dropped mosquitoes could survive to take meals from humans. The mosquito tests were known as Operation Big Buzz.Novick, Lloyd and Marr, John S. Public Health Issues Disaster Preparedness, (Google Books), Jones & Bartlett Publishers, 2001, p. 87, . The U.S. engaged in at least two other EW testing programs, Operation Drop Kick and Operation May Day.

No deaths are known to have resulted from this program. =Vulnerability field tests= In military venues In August 1949 a U.S. Army Special Operations Division, operating out of Fort Detrick in Maryland, set up its first test at The Pentagon in Washington, D.C. Operatives sprayed harmless bacteria into the building's air conditioning system and observed as the microbes spread throughout the Pentagon. The U.S. military acknowledges that it tested several chemical and biological weapons on US military personnel in the desert facility, including the East Demilitarization Area near Deseret Chemical Depot/Deseret Chemical Test Center at Fort Douglas, Utah, but takes the position that the tests have contributed to long-term illnesses in only a handful of exposed personnel.The Salt Lake City Tribune, 2010-01-18, \\"Vets Say Toxic Tests Sickened Them; Government Says Prove It,\\" http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_14182244 , archived at http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2010/01/18-6 Veterans who took part believe they were also exposed to Agent Orange. The Department of Veterans Affairs denies almost all claims for care and compensation made by veterans who believe they got sick as a result of the tests. The U.S. military for decades remained silent about \\"Project 112\\" and its victims, a slew of tests overseen by the Army's Deseret Test Center in Salt Lake City. Project 112 starting in the 1960s tested chemical and biological agents, including VX, sarin and E. coli, on military personnel who did not know they were being tested. After the Defense Department finally acknowledged conducting the tests on unwitting human subjects, it agreed to help the Veterans' Affairs Department track down those who were exposed, but a Government Accountability Office report in 2008 scolded the military for ceasing the effort. In civilian venues Medical experiments were conducted on a large scale on civilians who had not consented to participate. Often, these experiments took place in urban areas in order to test dispersion methods. Questions were raised about detrimental health effects after experiments in San Francisco, California, were followed by a spike in hospital visits; however, in 1977 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that there was no association between the testing and the occurrence of pneumonia or influenza. The San Francisco test involved a U.S. Navy ship that sprayed Serratia marcescens from the bay; it traveled more than 30 miles. One dispersion test involved laboratory personnel disguised as passengers spraying harmless bacteria in Washington National Airport. Scientists tested biological pathogens, including Bacillus globigii, which were thought to be harmless, at public places such as subways. Light bulbs containing Bacillus globigii were dropped in New York City's subway system; the result was strong enough to affect people prone to illness (also known as Subway Experiment). Based on the circulation measurements, thousands of people would have been killed if a dangerous microbe was released in the same manner. A jet aircraft released material over Victoria, Texas, that was monitored in the Florida Keys. =GAO Report= In February 2008, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released report GAO-08-366 titled, \\"Chemical and Biological Defense, DOD and VA Need to Improve Efforts to Identify and Notify Individuals Potentially Exposed during Chemical and Biological Tests.\\" The report stated that tens of thousands of military personnel and civilians may have been exposed to biological and chemical substances through DOD tests. In 2003, the DOD reported it had identified 5,842 military personnel and estimated 350 civilians as being potentially exposed during the testing, known as Project 112. The GAO scolded the U.S. Department of Defense's (DOD) 2003 decision to stop searching for people affected by the tests was premature. The GAO report also found that the DoD made no effort to inform civilians of exposure, and that the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is failing to use available resources to inform veterans of possible exposure or to determine if they were deceased. After the DoD halted efforts to find those who may have been affected by the tests, veteran health activists and others identified approximately 600 additional individuals who were potentially exposed during Project 112. Some of the individuals were identified after the GAO reviewed records stored at the Dugway Proving Ground, others were identified by the Institute of Medicine. Many of the newly identified suffer from long term illnesses that may have been caused by the biological or chemical testing. Current (post-1969) bio-defense program Both the U.S. bio-weapons ban and the Biological Weapons Convention restricted any work in the area of biological warfare to defensive in nature. In reality, this gives BWC member- states wide latitude to conduct biological weapons research because the BWC contains no provisions for monitoring or enforcement.Joseph Cirincione, et al. Deadly Arsenals, p. 35. The treaty, essentially, is a gentlemen's agreement amongst members backed by the long-prevailing thought that biological warfare should not be used in battle.Littlewood, Jez. The Biological Weapons Convention: A Failed Revolution, (Google Books), Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2005, p. 9, (). After Nixon declared an end to the U.S. bio-weapons program, debate in the Army centered around whether or not toxin weapons were included in the president's declaration. Following Nixon's November 1969 order, scientists at Fort Detrick worked on one toxin, Staphylococcus enterotoxin type B (SEB), for several more months. Nixon ended the debate when he added toxins to the bio-weapons ban in February 1970. The U.S. also ran a series of experiments with anthrax, code named Project Bacchus, Project Clear Vision and Project Jefferson in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In recent years certain critics have claimed the U.S. stance on biological warfare and the use of biological agents has differed from historical interpretations of the BWC.\\"Introduction to Biological Weapons\\", Federation of American Scientists, official site. Retrieved January 9, 2009. For example, it is said that the U.S. now maintains that the Article I of the BWC (which explicitly bans bio- weapons), does not apply to \\"non-lethal\\" biological agents. Previous interpretation was stated to be in line with a definition laid out in Public Law 101-298, the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989.\\"Original U.S. Interpretation of the BWC\\", (PDF),Federation of American Scientists, official site. Retrieved January 9, 2009. That law defined a biological agent as: > any micro-organism, virus, infectious substance, or biological product that > may be engineered as a result of biotechnology, or any naturally occurring > or bioengineered component of any such microorganism, virus, infectious > substance, or biological product, capable of causing death, disease, or > other biological malfunction in a human, an animal, a plant, or another > living organism; deterioration of food, water, equipment, supplies, or > material of any kind ... According to the Federation of American Scientists, U.S. work on non-lethal agents exceeds limitations in the BWC.

Erasmus' monastery, located south of Rethymon in central Crete, was a centre of resistance to foreign domination by the Turkish r√©gime. As such, the bishop was driven into exile around 1739. He is regarded as the founder of the first Greek Orthodox congregation in Amsterdam. In 1763, the Greek bishop, who was visiting London at the time, is believed to have consecrated John Wesley a bishop by some Methodists, and ordained several Methodist lay preachers as priests, including John Jones and Thomas Bryant. However, its believed Wesley could not openly announce his episcopal consecration without incurring the penalty of the Pr√¶munire Act. In light of Wesley's alleged episcopal consecration by Erasmus, some believe that Methodists lay a claim on apostolic succession, as understood in the traditional sense, since John Wesley ordained and sent forth every Methodist preacher in his day, who preached and baptized and ordained, and since every Methodist preacher who has ever been ordained as a Methodist was allegedly ordained in this direct \\"succession\\" from Erasmus. Nevertheless, there are some individuals who dispute Wesley's consecration by Erasmus or condemned it, most notably Augustus Toplady. According to The Greek Orthodox Theological Review, Bishop Erasmus of the Diocese of Aracadia also ordained other famous clergymen, including Samson Staniforth, Thomas Bryant, Alexander Mather, among other men, as presbyters: The eastern prelate was also well respected in London, by men who had known Erasmus in the Ottoman Empire.

From 1829‚Äì1835, he traveled to Cache Valley and the Snake River area with the American Fur Company. With the help of Native American guides, he explored what is now Yellowstone National Park in 1834. He recorded his experiences in a journal that was published as the book Life in the Rocky Mountains in 1940. The book contained the first settler-made map of the area, called the \\"Map of the Northwest Fur Country.\\" Ferris became a surveyor in Texas in the area that is now Dallas. He also served on the Texas State Congress. Ferris settled down as a farmer in his later life and wrote articles for a local Dallas newspaper. Biography =Early life= Warren Angus Ferris (Ferriss) was born December 26, 1810, in Glen Falls, New York, to Angus and Sarah Ferris. His ancestors were Puritans and Quakers. Ferris's father died from a sudden illness in 1813, and his mother married Joshua Lovejoy. Ferris grew up with his family in Buffalo. Although it is unclear whether Ferris received a formal education, his mother provided her children with books and helped expose them to nature and science. She died in 1814 when a group of Native Americans burned down the houses in their neighborhood; Sarah attempted to defend their home, but was killed by a young Native American boy. Ferris's step-father, Lovejoy, married Sally Ferriss, who raised Warren and his brothers after Lovejoy's death in 1824. Ferris learned to hunt, fish, and trap as a young boy. His early experiences growing up around Native Americans piqued his interest in their culture. He observed their celebrations and interactions. In his youth, Ferris also saw the completion of the Erie Canal, which was finished in 1825. This proximity to Native American culture and the accessibility to travel inspired Ferris's spirit of adventure and prompted him to move out west. =American Fur Company= Ferris left Buffalo and got a job in Pittsburgh working for a merchant. He only held this job for three months before the merchant went out of business. He later found other employment in Cincinnati selling magazine subscriptions for the Western Tiller. He became restless reading about the west and wanted to see it for himself. He moved to St. Louis and opened a \\"mathematical and English school\\" in his home to pay for rent. The school was subscription based, so his income was determined by the number of students who attended. Ferris managed to attract some students during his first term teaching, but closed the school because parents did not pay him tuition fees due to his bad temper. In 1829, however, he joined the American Fur Company as one of 45 Americans and Canadians who would explore the Rocky Mountains. Ferris left on his first expedition with the company in 1830; the company lasted five years and included mapping Yellowstone. The expedition left from St. Louis and made their way following the Platte River. The group divided into smaller groups in order to more efficiently survey the land. Ferris was sent to Cache Valley, and located settlers there in November. By December, his group had set up a winter camp in Salt Lake City. The group was informed by local Native Americans of the Snake River country. In April 1831, they decided to explore the area. During the expedition, Ferris came in contact and maintained cordial relations with the Salish, who Ferris and other Europeans called Flathead Indians. The Salish accompanied Ferris on some of his excursions. In May 1832 he traveled to Pierre's Hole to rendezvous with the entire crew of the expedition. He chose to spend the winter of 1834 with the Salish. In October 1835, Ferris returned home. He kept a journal of his travels which were later published as the book Life in the Rocky Mountains (1940). On one trip in 1834, Ferris acted as a clerk for the American Fur Company in a trapping party to the mountains of western Wyoming. Out of curiosity, Ferris found Native American guides and made a side journey into what is today Yellowstone National Park. In his journal Ferris gave one of the first descriptions of the geysers of the Yellowstone region. > From the surface of a rocky plain or table, burst forth columns of water of > various dimensions, projected high in the air, accompanied by loud > explosions, and sulphurous vapors, which were highly disagreeable to the > smell. ...The largest of these wonderful fountains, projects a column of > boiling water several feet in diameter, to the height of more than one > hundred and fifty feet. ...These explosions and discharges occur at > intervals of about two hours.... Warren's map of the Northwest fur country When Ferris returned to Buffalo, he found that while he had been away, his brother Charles had taken care of the family. When Ferris came back, however, Charles left the family in financial crisis, and Ferris was forced to remain in Buffalo to take care of them. Their half-brother Joshua issued a lawsuit against Charles, and while waiting for case to be settled, he devoted his time to writing his journal. Ferris also drew his \\"Map of the Northwest Fur Country\\" which was written to be published along with his journal. Charles went off to fight in Texas, and when he returned in 1836, he claimed to have 5,400 acres of land there. Ferris decided to accompany his brother to Texas in the hopes of earning a fortune; this left Joshua in charge of family affairs in January 1837. The brothers settled the financial debts later that year, although they continued to have disputes over money throughout their lives. =Surveyor in Texas= Ferris intended to join the army in Texas since the government was giving land grants to veterans and settlers, but Ferris never received a commission. He and his brother decided to take up surveying in Texas, although they had no formal training. They purchased the materials and books in order to train themselves. Ferris became ill, and Charles went out to survey, leaving him alone to recover. After recovering, Ferris successfully joined a militia expedition against Native Americans in September 1837. Ferris became the official surveyor for Nacogdoches County in late 1837, a position that gave him social status and financial security. While serving in this position, Ferris enlisted in military service again during the C√≥rdova Rebellion in 1838. In 1839 Ferris surveyed at the Three Forks of the Trinity River, deciding the lines and direction of streets for today's Dallas County. Ferris entered and surveyed this land prior to John Neely Bryan, the commonly accepted founder of Dallas. Ferris followed the direction of streams and rivers in Dallas, and, therefore, the streets run northeast to southwest instead of north-south and east-west. He invited Joshua Lovejoy (who changed his name to Clarence) to come to Texas and survey with him. They made arrangements to divide the land they received equally. Lovejoy arrived and helped Ferris survey in 1841, but was disappointed that he did not receive all the goods and riches that he expected. This caused fighting and betrayal in their relationship, which lasted throughout their lifetime. Ferris left Nacogdoches County and moved to Crockett, where he was elected to represent Houston County in the Texas Congress. After grieving the death of his wife Melinda, Ferris settled on 640 acres of land in Dallas in 1845. This land would later become Forest Hills, and part of it became a cemetery. The first records of Ferris using the northwest corner of his homestead as a cemetery are from 1847, and the last records are from 1906. Ferris was called upon to resurvey the Dallas area in 1850. He finished surveying the 30 square miles in just 10 days despite unfavorable weather conditions. This was his last large surveying job. Throughout the 1850s Ferris practiced farming. He was one of the first citizens to try growing cotton in Dallas. By 1860, Ferris no longer identified himself as a surveyor, but a farmer. In the aftermath of the American Civil War, Ferris sold some of his land to pay for debts. In his later life, Ferris wrote articles for a local newspaper. He had a series of over twenty articles published between 1871 and 1872. =Personal life= Ferris married Melinda G. Cook in April 1842. After Melinda's death in 1844, Ferris was determined to fulfill her dying wish, that he find another wife to raise her children. The next year Ferris courted Angeline Cook, Melinda's cousin, but she broke off their engagement due to her family's lack of approval. He was married to Frances \\"Fanny\\" Moore in 1847. Ferris was the father of 12 children. Frances died in childbirth in 1869, leaving Ferris to raise their young children. He sympathized with the Democratic Party and the Confederacy during the U.S. Civil War. He died on 8 February 1873 and is buried in the Forest Hills area of Dallas, Texas. Throughout his life he had disputes with his half-brother Joshua Lovejoy. He maintained correspondence with his family in Buffalo, New York, when he moved to Texas.

The endophyte has been identified as the cause of the \\"fescue toxicosis\\" syndrome sometimes suffered by livestock that graze the infected grass. Possible symptoms include poor weight gain, elevated body temperature, reduced conception rates, agalactia, rough hair coat, fat necrosis, loss of switch and ear tips, and lameness or dry gangrene of the feet. Because of the resemblance to symptoms of ergotism in humans, the most likely agents responsible for fescue toxicosis are thought to be the ergot alkaloids, principally ergovaline produced by E. coenophiala. Continued popularity of tall fescue with this endophyte, despite episodic livestock toxicosis, is attributable to the exceptional productivity and stress tolerance of the grass in pastures and hay fields. The endophyte produces two classes of alkaloids, loline alkaloids and the pyrrolopyrazine, peramine, which are insecticidal and insect deterrent, respectively, and presence of the fungus increases drought tolerance, nitrogen utilization, phosphate acquisition, and resistance to nematodes. Recently, natural strains of E. coenophiala with little or no ergot alkaloid production have been introduced into tall fescue for new cultivar development. These strains are apparently not toxic to livestock, and also provide some, but not necessarily all, of the benefits attributable to the \\"common toxic\\" strains in the older tall fescue cultivars. Epichlo√´ coniophiala was originally described as an Acremonium species and later moved to the anamorphic form genus Neotyphodium. Today, it is classified in Epichlo√´. Molecular phylogenetic analysis indicates that E. coenophiala is an interspecific hybrid with three ancestors: E. festucae, a strain from the Epichlo√´ typhina complex (from Poa nemoralis) and a third, undescribed or extinct species similar to the Lolium associated clade of Epichlo√´ baconii that also contributed a genome to the hybrid endophyte E. occultans, among others.

Camp and city were linked via a bridge from the same time. During the Middle Ages, Deutz was an important centre of learning in medieval Germany. Up into the early Middle Ages it was known by the Latin name Divitia, from the 10th century as Tuitium. It was located on the right bank of the Rhine, opposite Cologne, which grew up on the left bank. In 1002, the old castle in Deutz was made a Benedictine monastery by Heribert, archbishop of Cologne, and the important abbey was home to many influential theologians, such as Rupert of Deutz. Permission to fortify the town was in 1230 granted to the citizens by the archbishop of Cologne, between whom and the counts of Berg it was divided in 1240. It was burnt in 1376, 1445 and 1583; and in 1678, after the Treaties of Nijmegen, the fortifications were dismantled; they were rebuilt in 1816 and finally razed in 1888. In 1869, Nicolaus August Otto and Eugen Langen moved their company NA Otto and Cie to Deutz, where the company was renamed to Gasmotoren-Fabrik Deutz (the \\"Deutz Gas Engine Manufacturing Company\\").http://www.nicolaus-august-otto.de/ Arguably, this is the birthplace of the modern Otto-engine, precursor for all modern internal combustion engines.

This species is a bushshrike, a group closely related to the true shrikes in the family Laniidae, and formerly included in that family. Identification The southern tchagra is 17‚Äì21 cm in length. It has a brown crown and black eye stripes separated by a broad white supercilium. The underparts are pale grey and the upperparts pale brown. The folded wings are chestnut and the tail is black, tipped white. The longish bill is black. The sexes are similar, but young birds are duller and have a buff stripe through the eye. This species is similar to the black-crowned tchagra, but that species is larger, and the adult, as its name implies, has a black rather than brown crown. An identification pitfall is that juvenile black-crowned tchagra has a brown crown. It can be separated from southern tchagra by its larger size, relatively shorter bill and paler underparts. There are three fairly similar subspecies of southern tchagra. Nominate T. t. tchagra of the Western Cape has the darkest underparts and longest bill. T. t. caffrariae has paler underparts and the shortest bill, and T. t. natalensis of eastern South Africa and Swaziland has the palest underparts and a reddish-brown crown. The male southern tchagra has a descending whistling song, ttttrtr te te te teuuu given in its display flight or from a perch. The female responds with a trilled tzerrrrrrrr. Behaviour The cup nest is constructed of twigs and stems in a branch fork in a bush or scrub. Two, sometimes three eggs are laid. These are white, marked with grey and reddish-brown, and hatch after about 16 days, with another 14 days to fledging. This is a solitary territorial species, less conspicuously than true shrikes, especially when breeding. It forages on the ground for insects and other small prey.

In Cologne Cathedral, carved ca. 1470. Victor von Carbenalso known as Victor of Carben (1422‚Äì1515) was a German rabbi of Cologne who converted to Catholicism and later became a priest. Victor endeavored to show his zeal for his new religion by writing against his former coreligionists. He was involved in the Pfefferkorn controversy, and was one of the four imperial commissioners appointed to examine Jewish books for blasphemy against Christianity, the others being Johannes Pfefferkorn, Johann Reuchlin, and Jacob van Hochstraten. His work, Judenb√ºchlein, published in Cologne in 1508 or 1509 described the conditions and customs of Jews with a view toward aiding in their conversion. He disputed with learned Jews before the Archbishop of Cologne at Bonn, and secured the expulsion of Jews from Br√ºhl, Deutz, and other towns in the Diocese of Cologne. He wrote to the archbishop, congratulating him on having \\"plucked away the weeds from his bishopric and ridden it of Jews,\\" though like Pfefferkorn, he tried to persuade Christians that mistreating Jews would not aid in their conversion. In his writings Victor repeatedly asserts that it is not wise for Christians to enter into religious controversy with Jews, the latter being taught from childhood how to uphold their faith. He was chiefly concerned in exonerating himself from the accusation of having apostatized for the sake of worldly advantages; and in view of this, he paid the Jews a gratuitous compliment when he asserted that they, of all the people of the earth, are the most difficult to convert, their attachment to their Law being so strong that neither riches nor fear of persecution can cause them to abandon their faith. In his old age Victor became a priest; and after his death the following epitaph was engraved on the door of the church of Sainte- Ursule at Cologne: \\"Victor, formerly a Jew, wrote in the year 1509 four works against the errors of the Jews.\\" Bibliography Victor was the author of Opus Aureum ac Novum in quo Omnes Jud√¶orum Errores Manifestantur, divided into four parts, the first of which treats of the life and customs of the Jews (Cologne, 1509). Raimann holds that the real author of the latter work was Ortuinus Gratius. It was translated into German.

Morris spoke to the media saying ‚ÄúI spoke to the boys at Cronulla and I know the timing isn‚Äôt ideal. It‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm unhappy with any of the boys at the Sharks, But this is a unique opportunity. My brother isn‚Äôt just any old mate, this is the bloke who I started this journey with, ‚ÄúNow another opportunity has presented itself and I‚Äôd regret it for the rest of my life if I didn‚Äôt try and make it happen\\". On 11 March 2020, Morris request to be released by Cronulla-Sutherland to join the Sydney Roosters was granted. The Cronulla club released a statement saying \\"The 33-year-old will be released following the Sharks round two match against the Melbourne Storm. \\"After much internal discussion and following lengthy negotiations with the Sydney Roosters, the release request has been granted ultimately due to circumstances surrounding the Sharks salary cap, a situation which has been impacted by previous infringements\\".

She was among the most widely read 18th- century English authors.Prescott, Sarah. \\"Provincial Networks, Dissenting Connections, and Noble Friends: Elizabeth Singer Rowe and Female Authorship in Early Eighteenth Century England.\\" Eighteenth-Century Life. 25 (Winter 2001):20. She wrote mainly religious poetry, but her best known Friendship in Death (1728) consisted of a series of imaginary letters from the dead to the living. Despite a posthumous reputation as a pious, bereaved recluse, Rowe kept up a wide correspondence and was involved in local concerns at Frome in her native Somerset. She remained popular and often translated well into the 19th century, on both sides of the Atlantic. Though little read today, scholars note she was stylistically and thematically radical for her time.Peter Walmsley, \\"Whigs in Heaven: Elizabeth Rowe's Friendship in Death\\". Eighteenth-Century Studies. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2011; Paula R. Backscheider, Elizabeth Singer Rowe and the Development of the English Novel. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2013. Biography Born on 11 September 1674 at Ilchester, Somerset, she was the eldest daughter of Elizabeth Portnell and Walter Singer, a dissenting minister.Pritchard, John. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.Oxford: Oxford UP, 2004. Her parents met while Portnell was doing charity work in the prison at Ilchester where Singer was being held with other Dissenters. He left the ministry after marrying Portnell and became a clothier.Backscheider, Paula R.: Elizabeth Singer Rowe and the Development of the English Novel. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2013, pp. 7‚Äì8). In her youth, Elizabeth was \\"doted on by her father\\" and well educated. She was also taught Nonconformist or Dissenting doctrine: women were allowed to speak in public, and to participate in choosing ministers and admitting new church members; she participated vigorously in local church affairs. Her father also inculcated her interests in literature, music and painting, and she is thought to have attended a boarding school. In the biography affixed to the front of her posthumously published Miscellaneous Works, her brother-in-law, Theophilus Rowe, described her: \\"Mrs. Rowe was not a regular beauty, yet she possessed a large measure of the charms of her sex. She was of a moderate stature, her hair of a fine auburn colour, and her eyes of a darkish grey inclining to blue, and full of fire. Her complexion was exquisitely fair, and a natural rosy blush glowed in her cheeks. She spoke gracefully, and her voice was exceeding sweet and harmonious, and perfectly suited to that gentle language which always flowed from her lips.\\" Rowe's mother died when she was about 18, and her father moved the family to Egford Farm, Frome, Somerset, where she was tutored in French and Italian by Henry Thynne, son of the first Viscount Weymouth of Longleat, Wiltshire. The connections Rowe made at Longleat benefited her literary career and initiated a lifelong friendship with Frances Thynne, the viscount's daughter. Thynne's great-aunt, Anne Finch, wrote a coterie poem that mentions Philomela (Rowe) around 1713, and the Thynnes and Anne Finch became her patrons. Although courted by John Dunton, Matthew Prior and Isaac Watts, she married the poet and biographer Thomas Rowe, 13 years her junior, in 1710. Their marriage was reportedly happy, but short: Thomas died of tuberculosis in 1715. After his death, Rowe left London and returned to Frome and joined her father in Rook Lane House, where a plaque in her memory has been placed. Rowe's father died in 1719 leaving her a considerable inheritance, half the annual income of which she gave to charity. Rowe once wrote, \\"My letters ought to be call'd Epistles from the Dead to the Living,\\" and she carefully put her papers in order before her death, even writing farewell letters to friends in what seems \\"to have been conceived as part of a posthumous 'good-death' print event staged\\" by Rowe herself.Kathryn King, \\"Elizabeth Singer Rowe's tactical use of print and manuscript.\\" Women's Writing and the Circulation of Ideas: Manuscript Publication in England, 1550-1800, eds. George L. Justice and Nathan Tinker. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2002, p. 172. She died on 20 February 1737 of apoplexy and was interred with her father in his grave at Rook Lane Congregational Church. Literary works Something of a prodigy, Rowe began writing at the age of 12, probably without her parents' knowledge. At 19 she began a \\"platonic\\" correspondence with John Dunton, a bookseller and founder of the Athenian Society, which was the source material for Dunton's \\"outrageous,\\" \\"hilarious\\" and \\"sinister\\", 61-page summary of his relationship with Rowe entitled \\"The Double Courtship.\\"King, Kathryn. \\"Elizabeth Singer Rowe's tactical use of print and manuscript.\\" Women's Writing and the Circulation of Ideas: Manuscript Publication in England, 1550‚Äì1800, eds George L. Justice and Nathan Tinker (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2002), pp. 165‚Äì66. Between 1693 and 1696 she was the principal contributor of poetry to Dunton's The Athenian Mercury, but later regretted her affiliation with him, as \\"a print-world impresario\\" whose adaptions of masculine gallantry to commercial print were \\"ridiculed\\" by the literati. Many of these poems were reprinted in Poems on Several Occasions, also published by Dunton. During this time, she wrote in imitation of Pindar under the pseudonyms Philomela and the Pindarick Lady, Pindar's approach to writing odes on abstractions was a popular verse form in the late 17th century. Frontispiece and title page of Poems on Several Occasions, 1696.Poems on Several Occasions (1696) Written under the pseudonym Philomela, this collection was published by John Dunton when Rowe was twenty- two.

Title page for Friendship in Death, second ed. 1729Friendship in Death, in Twenty Letters From the Dead to the Living (1728) Undoubtedly her most popular work, Friendship in Death, first published in 1728, went through at least 79 editions by 1825 and another ten by 1840.Backscheider, Paula. Elizabeth Singer Rowe and the Development of the English Novel (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2013), p. 2. In the 18th century, editions of this work consistently outnumbered Defoe's Robinson Crusoe and Richardson's Clarissa and the gap grew wider as the century progressed. The work consists of imaginary letters from virtuous friends and loved ones, including a two- year-old child to his grieving mother, who have died, gone to heaven and wish to impart spiritual advice, mainly in the interest of making sure that the souls of friends and loved ones go to heaven. The subject matter of the letters consists mainly of moral dilemmas and contemporary issues; many of the letters are reminiscent of moral essays, while others are closer to the situations depicted in novels.Staves, Susan. A Literary History of Women's Writing in Britain, 1660-1789. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 224. Here Rowe seems to be conducting a campaign against the libertinism found in amatory fiction. In the preface, Rowe states her didactic intent, \\"The Drift of these Letters is, to impress the Notion of the Soul's Immortality; without which, all Virtue and Religion, with their Temporal and Eternal good Consequences, must fall to the Ground.\\"Rowe, Elizabeth Singer. Friendship in Death, in Twenty Letters from the Dead to the Living, ed. Josephine Greider (New York: Garland, 1972), p. 1. According to the spirits, death is to be welcomed and not feared since the soul experiences bliss in heaven. Rowe's most immediate and well known literary model for Friendship in Death was Tom Brown's Letters from the Dead to the Living (1702) although Brown's work features famous men who make witty comments both on infamous contemporaries and hell.Grieder, Josephine.

Volume the Last (1753). Letters on Various Occasions, in Prose and Verse (1729) This collection includes the first part of Letters Moral and Entertaining. Letters Moral and Entertaining (1729-32) The title page of Elizabeth Singer Rowe's \\"Devout Exercises of the Heart in Meditation and Soliloquy, Prayer and Praise,\\" originally published in 1737 (1802 edition). Letters Moral and Entertaining was a three-part series of fictionalized letters focusing on love, marriage and death. Perhaps best described as a didactic miscellany, this work also contained religious poetry, pastorals, translations of Tasso and actual letters from the correspondence between Rowe and Lady Hertford. Part I, 1729, was published as a \\"sequel of sorts\\" to Friendship in Death and represents older forms of the coterie epistolary exchange of manuscript culture within the newer print culture.King, Katherine. \\"Elizabeth Singer Rowe's tactical use of print and manuscript.\\" Women's Writing and the Circulation of Ideas: Manuscript Publication in England, 1550-1800. eds.

The History of Joseph (1736) Rowe's The History of Joseph (1736) is an extended narrative poem in the tradition of English religious epics such as Milton's Paradise Lost and an allegorical paraphrase that adds detail to the Old Testament story of Joseph. Rowe's immediate predecessors were Richard Blackmore's A Paraphrase of the Book of Job (1700) and Matthew Prior's Solomon, or the Vanity of the World (1718). Joseph was translated into German influencing the Swiss poet Johann Jacob Bodmer and Friedrick Klopstock, a German poet whose biblical epic Messias (1749) was also influenced by Paradise Lost. In this work, she continues to critique libertinism as well as pagan mythology and priestcraft celebrating a hero who exudes the virtue of chastity as he resists the temptations of Potiphar's wife, called Sabrina by Rowe, who uses charms, astrology and the philosophical arguments of libertinism to try to seduce him. Philomela: or, Poems by Mrs. Elizabeth Singer {now Rowe} (1737) This is a reprint of the 1696 Poems on Several Occasions. Devout Exercises of the Heart in Meditation and Soliloquy, Prayer and Praise (1737) Following her death and according to her wishes, Isaac Watts revised and published her religious meditations in this work. The Miscellaneous Works in Prose and Verse of Mrs Elizabeth Rowe (1739) Published posthumously by Theophilus Rowe, this collection was prefaced by a highly complimentary biography and no less than twelve poetic tributes. Critical reception The article \\"The Life of Mrs. Elizabeth Row\\" which was published in \\"The Gentleman's Magazine\\" in May 1739. The 18th-century literary critic and lexicographer Samuel Johnson had praise for Rowe and wrote in a Miscellanies review that essayists in the collection \\"seem generally to have imitated, or tried to imitate, the copiousness and luxuriance of Mrs. Rowe. This, however, is not all their praise; they have laboured to add to her brightness of imagery, her purity of sentiment\\" and he gave her credit for a mastery of style which used the \\"ornaments of romance in the decoration of religion\\". Eighteenth-century English writer and bluestocking Elizabeth Carter lauded Rowe's \\"happy elegance of thought,\\" describing her verse as \\"refin'd by virtue\\" with \\"powerful strains [that] wake the nobler passions of the soul.\\" [21] Rowe's contemporaries considered her the \\"virtuous successor of Katherine Phillips.\\" After her death, other writers and the public emphasized her virtuous reputation. In 1739 The Gentleman's Magazine wrote on Rowe in a three-part series, calling her the ‚ÄúOrnament of her Sex.\\" George Ballard, 18th-century literary antiquarian and biographer, held up Rowe as the epitome of his domesticated model of the virtuous and modest, ideal woman writer in his highly influential Memoirs of Several Ladies of Great Britain: who have been celebrated for their writings or skill in the learned languages, arts and sciences (1752). John Duncombe's Feminiad (1754) praised both her character and her writing.Backscheider, Paula. Elizabeth Singer Rowe and the Development of the English Novel. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2013. Print. 4. As late as 1803 an anonymous writer suggested that Rowe represented ‚ÄúVirtue and all her genuine beauty [that should] recommend her to the choice and admiration of a rising generation.\\"Lady's Monthly Museum, 1803. She became a \\"cultural authority\\", influencing later women writers and 19th-century Christian female activists. Her works were reprinted nearly annually until 1855, out of print by 1860, and in 1897 she was not even mentioned in A Dictionary of English Authors; her reputation had gone from \\"exemplar\\" and \\"muse\\" to \\"antiquarian curiosity.\\" Recent scholars have interpreted Rowe as a pivotal figure in the development of the English novel: Rowe borrowed stock characters and situations from the late 17th and early 18th-century French and Italian romances popular in England, transforming the outward struggles to save the body of the heroine from seducers, to saving the mind and soul of the heroine from the corrupt world through the virtuous self-control that results from contemplation, thus sealing the plot trajectory of subsequent fiction as evidenced in later novels such as Eliza Haywood's Betsy Thoughtless, Samuel Richardson's Clarissa and Frances Burney's Cecilia. The proto-feminist and amatory significance of Rowe's literary contribution continues to be reassessed against her moral and didactic themes.

Mechanical arms are composed of multiple beams connected by hinges powered by actuators. One end of the arm is attached to a firm base while the other has a tool. They can be controlled by humans either directly or over a distance. A computer-controlled mechanical arm is called a robotic arm. However, a robotic arm is just one of many types of different mechanical arms. Mechanical arms can be as simple as tweezers or as complex as prosthetic arms. In other words, if a mechanism can grab an object, hold an object, and transfer an object just like a human arm, it can be classified as a mechanical arm. Recent advancements have been brought about to lead future improvements in the medical field with prosthetics and with the mechanical arm in general. When mechanical engineers build complex mechanical arms, the goal is for the arm to perform a task that ordinary human arms can not complete. Ambroise Pare: prosthetics, mechanical arm (Published: 1564)  History  = Robotic Arms = Researchers have classified the robotic arm by showing its industrial application, medical application, and technology, e.t.c. It has been first introduced in the late 1930s by William Pollard and Harold A. Roseland, where they developed a sprayer that had about five degrees of freedom and an electric control system. Pollard's was called ‚Äúfirst position controlling apparatus.‚Äù William Pollard never designed or built his arm, but it was a base for other inventors in the future. Other robotic arms were invented in 1961 by Unimate, evolving to the PUMA arm. In 1963, the Rancho arm was designed, along with many others in the future. Even though Joseph Engelberger marketed Unimate, George Devol invented the robotic arm. It focused on using Unimate for tasks that are harmful to humans. In 1959, a 2700-pound Unimate prototype was installed at the General Motors die-casting plant in Trenton, New Jersey. The Unimate 1900 series became the very first produced robotic arm for die- casting. During a very short period of time, it had produced at least 450 robotic arms were being used. It still remains one of the most significant contributions in the last one hundred years. As years went by, technology seemed to evolve, helping to build better robotic arms. Not only companies invented different robotic arms, but so did colleges. In 1969, Victor Scheinman from Stanford University invented the Stanford arm, where it had electronically powered arms that could move through six axes. Marvin Minsky, from MIT, built a robotic arm for the office of Naval Research, possibly for underwater explorations. This arm had twelve single degree freedom joints in this electric- hydraulic- high dexterity arm. Robots were initially created to perform a series of tasks that humans found boring, harmful, and tedious. = Prosthetics =  Before the Modern Era  Replica of a prosthetic arm. The original probably dates from between 1550 and 1600. The history of prosthetic limbs came to be by such great inventors. The world's first and earliest functioning body parts are two toes from Ancient Egypt. Because of their unique functionality, these toes are an example of a true prosthetic device. These toes carry at least forty percent of the body's weight. Most prosthetic limbs would be produced after there is intensive studying of a human being's form by using modern equipment. Prosthetic limbs were used during the war too, including during the late 1480s. A German knight, who served with the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, was injured during the war. Even though prosthetic limbs were expensive, this particular limb was manufactured by an armor specialist. Soldiers were allowed to continue their career because of prosthetics. The fingers could grasp a shield, hold reins to horses, and even a quill when drafting an important document.  Modern Era  Artificial left arm, London, England Wellcome. As time passed, limb design started to focus on people's specialties as well. For example, a pianist would need a different type of mechanical arm than others. Their limbs would be widespread and their middle and ring fingers would be smaller than normal. In addition, an arm design of padded tips on the thumb and little finger would allow a pianist to span a series of notes while playing their instrument. Technology for the prosthetic limbs kept evolving after World War I. After the war, laborers would return to work, using either legs or the arms because of its ability to grip objects. This is one of the designs that remains unchanged over the past century. People with such prosthetics would do everyday things like driving a car, eating food, and much more. = Arms for Automotive Manufacturing = 6 Axis Articulated Robots Without the mechanical arm, the production of cars would be extremely difficult. This problem was first solved in 1962 when the first mechanical arm was used in a ‚ÄúGeneral Motors‚Äù factory. Using this mechanical arm, also known as an industrial robot, engineers were able to achieve difficult welding tasks. In addition, the removal of die- castings was another important step in improving the abilities of a mechanical arm. With such technology, engineers were able to easily remove unneeded metal underneath mold cavities. Stemming off these uses, welding started to become increasingly popular for mechanical arms. In 1979, the company Nachi refined the first motor-driven robot to perform spot welding. Spot welding is a very important process used in the creation of cars to join separate surfaces together. Soon enough, mechanical arms were being passed down to additional car companies. As constant improvements were being made, the National University of Singapore (NUS) decided to make even further advancements by inventing a mechanical arm that can lift up to 80 times its original weight. Not only did this arm expand its lift strength, but the arm could also extend to five times its original length. These advancements were first introduced in 2012 and car companies can greatly benefit from this new scientific knowledge. = Surgical Arms = Laproscopic Surgery Robot (2006) Surgical arms were first used in 1985 when a neurosurgical biopsy was performed. Although 1985 was the first time a surgery actually took place with a mechanical arm, scientists have been working on developing surgical arms for centuries. In 1495, Leonardo Da Vinci designed a complex robotic arm, which paved the way for surgical arms of the future. In 1990, the FDA allowed endoscopic surgical procedures to be done by the Automated Educational Substitute Operator (AESOP) system. This was not the only improvement the FDA made, however. While the AESOP system was more of a Computer Motion system, the first surgery system came about in 2000. In 2000, Leonardo Da Vinci's discoveries led the ‚ÄúDa Vinci Surgery System‚Äù to become the first robotic surgery system approved by the FDA (Moran). Da Vinci's design and creativity of a complex surgical arm were over 500 years in the making. Types =Prosthetic arms= Prosthetics may not seem like a mechanical arm, but they are. It uses hinges and a wire harness to allow an incapable being to perform everyday functions. They have started creating arms that take a structure of a human arm and even though it looks like a skeletal metal arm, it moves like a normal arm and hand. This arm was made by Johns Hopkins University in 2015. It has 26 joints (way more than the old outdated arms) and is capable of lifting up to 45 pounds. This arm has 100 sensors that connect to the human mind. These sensors allow the person with the arm to move the arm like it was just another part of his or her body. People who have used this new prosthetic can say that they have actually been able to feel the texture, ultimately making prosthetics a huge part of the mechanical arm category. =Rover arms= Three generations of Mars rovers In space, NASA used a mechanical arm for new planetary discoveries. One of these discoveries came from sending a rover to another planet and collecting samples from this planet. With a rover, NASA can just keep the rover on its designated planet and explore all they want. Mechanical arms are also attached to the ships that are acting as satellite stations in Earth's atmosphere because they help grab debris that might cause damage to other satellites. Not only that, but they also keep astronauts safe when they have to go make a repair to the ship or satellite. Now, space isn't where all the rover's with mechanical arms are. Even the SWAT team and other special forces use these rovers to go into a building or unsafe area to defuse a bomb, plant a bomb or repair vehicles. =Everyday Mechanical Arms= Every day a person might be using a type of mechanical arm. Many mechanical arms are used for very ordinary things like being able to grab an out of reach object with the pincer mechanical arm. A simple system of 3 joints squeezes and releases motion causing the pincer to close and finally grab a desired object. Even the objects that might seem super simplistic like tweezers can be classified as a mechanical arm. This simple object is being used millions of times daily all thanks to the help of an engineer making a simple, but great design.  Modifications and Advancements  = Muscle Tissue for Mechanical Arms = The National University of Singapore has started making artificial muscle tissue to be able to be placed in mechanical arms to be able to help people pick up heavy loads. This artificial tissue can pick up to 500 times its own weight. Depending on how much of the tissue engineers place in the mechanical arm, the greater lift strength the arm has. A regular human well-grown adult weighs around 160 to 180 pounds. Now, a person weighing that much could be able to lift an object that weighs around 80,000 pounds. This would make construction sites a lot safer being able to just walk up with the construction supplies instead of using a crane that can collapse due to harsh weather. Soon, utility vehicles for construction may be a thing of the past. = Sensor Mechanical Arms = New mechanical arms being used for prosthetics are starting to gain sensors that, with the help of a chip attached to one's spinal cord, allows a person to move the arm. Since sensors can easily be programmed to have a higher sensitivity to anything the sensor touches, people with prosthetic arms will also be able to feel the object they are touching. With this, a person could feel even the slightest vibration. This could be a danger and a good thing. It can danger the human because if dealt with to much pressure the person with the prosthetic can suffer severe pain. Besides actually obtaining the sense of touch back, one could also sense more awareness of incoming danger. = Lifelike Mechanical Arms = Lifelike mechanical arms, along with ordinary human arms, are so similar that it may be hard to distinguish between the two. The reason for this is because a spray, that places a coat on the prosthetic arm, makes the arm look real. This futuristic fantasy is beginning to become more of a reality. Scientists are even starting to create sleeve type artificial skins to keep a prosthetic arm looking like a normal arm. This will allow people with prosthetics to not feel self-conscious of their robotic arm.

Zions Bancorporation is a bank holding company headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. Zions Bancorporation originated as Keystone Insurance and Investment Co., a Utah Corporation, in April 1955. In April 1960, Keystone, together with several individual investors, acquired a 57.5 percent interest in Zions First National Bank from the LDS Church. In 1965, the name of the company was changed to Zions Bancorporation. (However, it operated as Zions Utah Bancorporation from 1966 to 1987.) The first public offering of shares in Zions Bancorporation was made in January 1966. There continued to be some minority shareholders until April 1972, when the company exchanged the remaining minority shares for common shares. In 2018, Zions Bancorporation merged into its bank subsidiary, ZB, N.A., which was then renamed Zions Bancorporation, N.A. Zions Bancorporation now operates as a national bank doing business under eight local brands, rather than as a holding company.http://zionsbancorporation.com/ History Zions retail footprint The bank's history dates back to the founding of Zion's Savings Bank and Trust Company, which Brigham Young opened in the fall of 1873 during the Mormon settlement of Utah. It was Utah's first chartered savings bank and trust company. During the Panic of 1893, the bank managed not only to remain solvent, but continue to grow. During the early 20th century, Zions financed such firms as: * Bingham Copper Company (later Kennecott Utah Copper) * Salt Lake and Los Angeles Railroad Company (now Union Pacific Railroad) * Big Cottonwood Power Company (later Utah Power and today Rocky Mountain Power) * Salt Lake Gas Company (later Mountain Fuel Supply Company and today Questar Gas) The Panic of 1907 was the lone interruption in the steady growth of Zions. However, deposits grew from $2 million in 1901 to $9 million in 1918. =Great Depression= On the morning of February 15, 1932, 3 years after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, customers began a run on the bank, waiting in lines that ran out of the building and onto the street. Tellers were instructed to honor all withdrawal requests. In 2.5 days, a total of $1.5 million was withdrawn. Near the end of the second day, bank (and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) president Heber J. Grant placed a sign in the bank's window that read, in part: > [The bank] is in a very strong, clean, liquid condition. It can pay off > every depositor in full. Fear of its failure is not only without foundation, > but positively foolish. There is not a safer bank in the State or the > Nation. Lines of customers that had been as long as a city block began to dwindle, and within five or six days many customers returned to deposit their money. By month's end, total deposits were more than withdrawals, and Zions had survived the Great Depression. In 1957, Zion's merged with Utah Savings and Trust Company and First National Bank of Salt Lake City. The surviving institution was named Zions First National Bank. =1960‚Äì2007= In 1960, Keystone Insurance and Investment Company, which had been founded in 1955, bought a majority stake in Zions from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and changed its name to Zions Utah Bancorporation. It kept that name until 1987, when it was shortened to Zions Bancorporation, its present name, to reflect the growing presence of the company outside of Utah. In January 1966, Zions became a public company via an initial public offering. The bank expanded into Nevada in 1985 with the purchase of Nevada State Bank. The bank entered Arizona in 1986 with the acquisition of Mesa Bank. It expanded into Colorado and New Mexico in 1996 by acquiring Aspen Bancshares, which operated Pitkin County Bank and Trust, Valley National Bank of Cortez, and Centennial Savings Bank. Zions made many acquisitions in 1997 and 1998. In 1997, Zions acquired Vectra Banking Corporation and Tri-State Finance Corporation of Colorado. Zions also acquired Tri-State Bank of Idaho. It also bought 27 branches in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah from Wells Fargo. Zions expanded into California in 1997 and Washington in 1998, Oregon in 2005. In October 1998, Zions merged its three California holdings--Sumitomo Bank of California, San Diego-based Grossmont Bank and First Pacific National Bank--to create California Bank and Trust. In 1999, the company bid for First Security Corporation but lost to Wells Fargo after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission forced Zions to restate its results in prior years due to the way it accounted for acquisitions. Despite the unsuccessful pursuit of First Security, Zions became the largest bank headquartered in Utah. In 2001, the company was added to the S&P; 500 Index. In 2005, the company expanded into Texas with the purchase of Amegy Bank. =2008‚Äìpresent= On October 27, 2008, Zions received a $1.4 billion investment from the U.S. government as a result of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. It repaid the final $700 million on September 26, 2012, and the government realized a profit of $253 million from its investment in the company. On August 31, 2010, Zions announced the sale of its NetDeposit subsidiary to BankServ. On June 1, 2015, Zions Bancorporation announced a corporate restructuring, which included the consolidation of seven bank charters into a single charter and $120 million in expense reduction initiatives. In November 2017, Zions announced plans to merge the holding company and its banking subsidiary ZB, N.A. into one Zions Bancorporation, N.A.

Schroeder (born February 23, 1927)International Who's Who 2000, Vol. 63 (Europa, 1999: ), p. 1391. is an American historian, professor emeritus at the University of Illinois, and professor at Case Western Reserve University. He specializes in late-sixteenth- to twentieth-century European international politics, Central Europe, and the theory of history. Biography Schroeder was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Rupert H. Schroeder and Elfrieda Koch. He attended Concordia Seminary (graduated 1951), Texas Christian University, and the University of Texas at Austin, where he received his doctorate in 1958. He received the 1956 Beveridge Award for the best manuscript on American history submitted by a beginning historian.AHA Award Recipients. He was an associate professor of history at Concordia Senior College from 1958 to 1963, after which he was hired at the University of Illinois. In a 1972 essay entitled, \\"World War I as a Galloping Gertie\\", Schroeder contrary to established historical opinion and Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles laid the blame for the First World War on Britain's doorstep. Schroeder characterized the political events leading up to the war as a \\"Galloping Gertie,\\" a metaphor which described political events as escalating out of control, pulling and pushing all five Great Powers into an unwanted war.Schroder, Paul \\"World War I as a Galloping Gertie,\\" pages 142-151 from The Outbreak of World War I edited by Holger Herwig, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1997 page 144. Schroeder's research highlighted the fact that Britain was engaged in an ‚Äúencirclement\\" policy directed at the Austria-Hungary empire.Schroder, \\"World War I As A Galloping Gertie,\\" pp. 145-146. The British policy was not in keeping with the Congress System which had developed after the Napoleonic wars and was fundamentally anti-German, and even more so, anti- Austrian.Schroder, \\"World War I As A Galloping Gertie,\\" pp. 148-149 Britain's policy created an atmosphere in which Germany was forced into a \\"preventive war\\" to maintain Austria as an allied power.Schroder, \\"World War I As A Galloping Gertie,\\" pp. 149-150. Apart from his scholarship, Schroeder has been a regular contributor to the magazine The American Conservative, writing strong critiques of the Bush administration's foreign policy (especially regarding the Iraq War) for its destabilizing, counterproductive effects. The internationalist, realist perspective of his critiques fits well with his favorable appraisals of the 19th-century Concert-of-Europe approach to international relations that Schroeder has offered as a model in his scholarship. Perry Anderson has called him \\"arguably the greatest living American historian\\" and said that his The Transformation of European Politics, 1763-1848 \\"revolutionised one of the most disgraced of all fields in the discipline, ... diplomatic history.\\"Perry Anderson, \\"The Force of the Anomaly,\\" London Review of Books, Vol. 34 No. 8, 26 April 2012, p. 12.

They are more versatile than wheeled robots and can traverse many different terrains, though these advantages require increased complexity and power consumption. Legged robots often imitate legged animals, such as humans or insects, in an example of biomimicry. Gait and support pattern Legged robots, or walking machines, are designed for locomotion on rough terrain and require control of leg actuators to maintain balance, sensors to determine foot placement and planning algorithms to determine the direction and speed of movement.S. M. Song and K. J. Waldron, Machines that Walk: The Adaptive Suspension Vehicle, The MIT Press, 327 pp The periodic contact of the legs of the robot with the ground is called the gait of the walker. In order to maintain locomotion the center of gravity of the walker must be supported either statically or dynamically. Static support is provided by ensuring the center of gravity is within the support pattern formed by legs in contact with the ground. Dynamic support is provided by keeping the trajectory of the center of gravity located so that it can be repositioned by forces from one or more of its legs.M. H. Raibert, Legged Robots That Balance. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1986.  Types  Legged robots can be categorized by the number of limbs they use, which determines gaits available. Many-legged robots tend to be more stable, while fewer legs lends itself to greater maneuverability. = One-legged = One- legged, or pogo stick robots use a hopping motion for navigation. In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University developed a one-legged robot to study balance. Berkeley's SALTO is another example. = Two-legged = ASIMO - a bipedal robot Bipedal or two-legged robots exhibit bipedal motion. As such, they face two primary problems: # stability control, which refers to a robot's balance, and # motion control, which refers to a robot's ability to move. Stability control is particularly difficult for bipedal systems, which must maintain balance in the forward-backward direction even at rest. Some robots, especially toys, solve this problem with large feet, which provide greater stability while reducing mobility. Alternatively, more advanced systems use sensors such as accelerometers or gyroscopes to provide dynamic feedback in a fashion that approximates a human being's balance. Such sensors are also employed for motion control and walking. The complexity of these tasks lends itself to machine learning. Simple bipedal motion can be approximated by a rolling polygon where the length of each side matches that of a single step. As the step length grows shorter, the number of sides increases and the motion approaches that of a circle. This connects bipedal motion to wheeled motion as a limit of stride length. Two-legged robots include: * Boston Dynamics' Atlas * Toy robots such as QRIO and ASIMO. * NASA's Valkyrie robot, intended to aid humans on Mars. * The ping-pong playing TOPIO robot. = Four-legged = Quadruped robot \\"BigDog\\" was being developed as a mule that could traverse difficult terrain. Quadrupedal or four-legged robots exhibit quadrupedal motion. They benefit from increased stability over bipedal robots, especially during movement. At slow speeds, a quadrupedal robot may move only one leg at a time, ensuring a stable tripod. Four-legged robots also benefit from a lower center of gravity than two-legged systems. Four legged robots include: * The TITAN series, developed since the 1980s by the Hirose-Yoneda Laboratory. * The dynamically stable BigDog, developed in 2005 by Boston Dynamics, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the Harvard University Concord Field Station. * BigDog's successor, the LS3. * MIT's new back flipping mini Cheetah robot = Six-legged = Six-legged robots, or hexapods, are motivated by a desire for even greater stability than bipedal or quadrupedal robots. Their final designs often mimic the mechanics of insects, and their gaits may be categorized similarly. These include: * Wave gait: the slowest gait, in which pairs of legs move in a \\"wave\\" from the back to the front. * Tripod gait: a slightly faster step, in which three legs move at once. The remaining three legs provide a stable tripod for the robot. Six-legged robots include: * Odex, a 375-pound hexapod developed by Odetics in the 1980s. Odex distinguished itself with its onboard computers, which controlled each leg. * Genghis, one of the earliest autonomous six-legged robots, was developed at MIT by Rodney Brooks in the 1980s. * The modern toy series, Hexbug. = Eight-legged = Eight- legged legged robots are inspired by spiders and other arachnids, as well as some underwater walkers. They offer by far the greatest stability, which enabled some early successes with legged robots. Eight-legged robots include: * Dante, a Carnegie Mellon University project designed to explore Mount Erebus. * The T8X, a commercially available robot designed to emulate a spider's appearance and movements. = Hybrids = Some robots use a combination of legs and wheels. This grants a machine the speed and energy efficiency of wheeled locomotion as well as the mobility of legged navigation. Boston Dynamics' Handle, a bipedal robot with wheels on both legs, is one example.

Swords Lee, who represented Grant Parish in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1904 to 1908, operated a large sawmill there until it closed c. 1917 because of exhaustion of the timber supply. At the Tioga commissary, workers could use their mill script to buy groceries and supplies. Outside workers were paid a quarter per hour; if he worked inside the mill, he earned $3 per day. Many laborers were granted mill housing across the street from the commissary in \\"shotgun\\"-style shacks. The mill whistle announced the time to report for work, lunch, and the ending of the work shift. After the heyday of the lumber business, the United States military during World War II established local training facilities at nearby Camp Beauregard and Camp Livingston. The two military establishments played a major role in preparing United States military forces during World War II. The \\"Louisiana Maneuvers\\" prior to World War II originated at Camp Beauregard. Today Camp Livingston, located near Ball, has been abandoned and become largely overgrown. Its area has become part of Kisatchie National Forest. Risk remains of unexploded ordnance in the old firing ranges; visitors are advised to remain on approved roads and trails. Camp Beauregard remains an active base of the Louisiana National Guard.  Notable People  James Garland Murrell is a Tioga, Louisiana, native, and a graduate of Tioga High School in the class of 1983. He is the only son of Wayne Murrell and Deloris Murrell (n√©e Keller). He has one sister, Shelly Leger (n√©e Murrell) who is also a graduate of Tioga High School in the class of 1986. Murrell now resides in Los Angeles, California. Murrell graduated from the University of Louisiana at Monroe, formerly Northeast Louisiana University in 1989 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Radiologic Technology. He went on to pursue a Master of Science in Management from Troy University, graduating in 1994. He then started another Master of Science degree, this one in Radiologic Science Education from Midwestern State University graduating in 2000. Murrell is now pursuing a Doctoral degree in Education (Ed.D.) from Northeastern University in Boston, MA. He is active in the Association of Educators in Imaging and Radiologic Sciences, and holds the prestigious status of Fellow in the organization. James G. Murrell, star of Mummy Autopsy Murrell was one of the stars of the internationally broadcast television series Mummy Autopsy produced by Atlantic Productions on the Discovery Channel. Atlantic Productions describes the show as \\"a new series that uses forensic science and the latest investigative techniques to unlock the human stories of mummies around the world, examining their deaths - from disease, murder and even ritual sacrifice - and exploring their lives.\\" Murrell held a five-year talent contract with Discovery Communications from 2004-2009 to appear on the weekly series as a MI (Mummy Investigator) on the well-reviewed series by the Archeological Institute of America. While on Mummy Autopsy, Murrell traveled to six continents and 37 countries to investigate the mysterious deaths of both contemporary and ancient peoples around the globe. He is now the Executive Director of Imaging Sciences, the largest of its kind in California, at Gurnick Academy of Medical Arts in Los Angeles, California. Education Campus of Tioga High School Tioga Elementary serves kindergarten through grade 6. Grades 7‚Äì8 are taught at Tioga Junior High School while Tioga High School serves grades 9-12. Coach Jerry Ingram Jerry Donald Ingram (1942‚Äì2010) of Pineville, a Monroe native and a graduate of La Salle High School in Olla and the University of Louisiana at Monroe, was the football coach of the Tioga High School Indians from 1966 to 1986, when he retired to pursue a second career with Woodmen of the World Life Insurance Company. He was a field supervisor in Omaha, Nebraska, and in 1998 became the Louisiana state manager for the company, from which he retired in 2008. A cancer victim, he was survived by his wife, the former Susan Annette Cameron, and four children, Debbye I. Storer, Stephani I. Nassif, Jeffrey Scott Ingram, and Darron Keith Ingram, as well as grandkids Trevor Ingram, Jeremy Ingram, Braden Ingram, Ryan Ingram, and Mackenzie Ingram. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Ball. During the middle 1970s, Kevin Vanek, the president of Red River Youth Football, played under Ingram, who in 1969 became the Tioga head coach. Vanek recalls a story about Ingram's influence on the team: \\"We lost a big game to Winnfield ... We were No. 10 in the state, they were No. 2. We had the game won, and we just blew it. I mean, it was a traumatic loss for all of us. We go back into the locker room, we're all feeling bad and down on ourselves, and Coach comes in the locker room and tries to take the blame. And it was like, in unison, every player in that locker room stood up to say \\"No, Coach, you can't do that.\\"' Vanek continues: \\"He never put winning ahead of the kids. That's why everybody stood up for him. He knew we were all feeling horrible about it, and instead of yelling and screaming at us, he tried to take it on himself. That's what made him such a special person.\\" In 1973, the Indians led by quarterback Jim Adams ended their season as the AAA District Runner-up under Coach Ingram. Running backs Chris Williams, Murray Stokes, Bruce Radford, and lineman Kent Combs advanced to successful collegiate careers. Williams and Radford went on to play in the National Football League. In 1985, his last year as coach, Ingram was given a plaque by the Tioga High School team that went undefeated. In 2018, Tioga will name their football stadium in his honor. Recreation Tioga is also served by the Ward Ten Recreation District, which participates in Dixie Youth baseball and Dixie Girls softball. The Dixie Belles (ages 13‚Äì15) won the 2001 Dixie Belles World Series.

In his book 1909 book The Christ, Remsburg lists forty-two ancient writers who did not mention Jesus or whose mentions are suspect, and this list has appeared in many subsequent books that question the historicity of Jesus. Remsburg himself wrote that the man Jesus may have existed, but that the Christ of the gospels is mythical. Life Remsburg was born in Fremont, Ohio, a son of George J. and Sarah A. (Willey) Remsburg. He enlisted in the Union army at the age of sixteen during the American Civil War. On October 9, 1870, he married Miss Nora M. Eiler of Atchison, Kansas. He was a teacher for 15 years, a superintendent of public instruction in Atchison County, Kansas for four years, then a writer and lecturer in support of free thought, his lectures being translated into German, French, Bohemian, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Bengali and Singalese. He was also a life member of the American Secular Union, of which he was president from 1897‚Äì1900, and a member of the Kansas State Horticultural Society. Views Remsburg was a rationalist and critic of morality as found in the Bible. Although he lived in Atchison, Kansas, that town's library has no copies of his work, according to Fred Whitehead in Freethought History (#2, 1992). In Bible Morals, he cited twenty crimes and vices sanctioned by scripture. In his The Bible, he condemns as pernicious and false such Biblical views as: > Blessed are the poor in spirit; Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit > the earth; If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out; If thy right hand > offend thee, cut it off; Whosoever shall marry her that is divorced > committeth adultery; Resist not evil; Whosoever shall smite thee on the > right cheek, turn to him the other also; Love your enemies; Lay not up for > yourselves treasurers upon earth; Take no thought for your life, what ye > shall eat, or what ye shall drink, nor yet for your body, what ye shall put > on; Take therefore no thought for the morrow. Such views, combined with the name of Christ, Remsburg held, have caused more persecutions, wars, and miseries than any other. Remsburg \\"delivered over 3,000 lectures, speaking in fifty-two States, Territories and Provinces, and in 1,250 different cities and towns, including every large city of United States and Canada.\\" Role in Christ Myth debate In recent years a list of forty-two names from the \\"Silence of Contemporary Writers\\" chapter of The Christ (sometimes called the Remsberg List) has appeared in several books regarding the nonhistoricity hypothesis by authors such as James Patrick Holding, Hilton Hotema, Jawara D. King, Madalyn Murray O'Hair, Dorothy M. MurdockMaurice Casey Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths? T&T; Clark 2014 p21-22 Robert M. Price, Asher Norman, Frank Zindler, and Tim C. Leedom et al. This Remsburg List was improved upon in 2012 with the book No Meek Messiah, augmenting the number of \\"Silent Writers\\" to 126. The list was published in Free Inquiry magazine in August 2014. Remsburg stated \\"This volume on \\"The Christ\\" was written by one who recognizes in the Jesus of Strauss and Renan a transitional step, but not the ultimate step, between orthodox Christianity and radical Freethought. By the Christ is understood the Jesus of the New Testament. The Jesus of the New Testament is the Christ of Christianity. The Jesus of the New Testament is a supernatural being. He is, like the Christ, a myth. He is the Christ myth\\".Remsburg, John (1909) The Christ Preface Moreover, Remsburg clarified that \\"It is not against the man Jesus that I write, but against the Christ Jesus of theology\\" explaining that \\"Jesus of Nazareth, the Jesus of humanity, the pathetic story of whose humble life and tragic death has awakened the sympathies of millions, is a possible character and may have existed; but the Jesus of Bethlehem, the Christ of Christianity, is an impossible character and does not exist.\\"Remsburg, John (1909) The Christ Chapter 1 Furthermore, in \\"The Christ a Myth\\" chapter Remsburg described myth as falling into three broad categories: historical, philosophical, and poetic (a mixture of the previous two). Remsburg concluded the chapter by stating \\"While all Freethinkers are agreed that the Christ of the New Testament is a myth they are not, as we have seen, and perhaps never will be, fully agreed as to the nature of this myth. Some believe that he is a historical myth; others that he is a pure myth. Some believe that Jesus, a real person, was the germ of this Christ whom subsequent generations gradually evolved; others contend that the man Jesus, as well as the Christ, is wholly a creation of the human imagination. After carefully weighing the evidence and arguments in support of each hypothesis the writer, while refraining from expressing a dogmatic affirmation regarding either, is compelled to accept the former as the more probable.\\" In \\"The Christ a Myth\\" chapter, Remsburg also stated: \\"The conceptions regarding the nature and character of Christ, and the value of the Christian Scriptures as historical evidence, are many, chief of which are the following 1\\\\. Orthodox Christians believe that Christ is a historical character, supernatural and divine; and that the New Testament narratives, which purport to give a record of his life and teachings, contain nothing but infallible truth. 2\\\\. Conservative Rationalists, like Renan, and the Unitarians, believe that Jesus of Nazareth is a historical character and that these narratives, eliminating the supernatural elements, which they regard as myths, give a fairly authentic account of his life. 3\\\\. Many radical Freethinkers believe that Christ is a myth, of which Jesus of Nazareth is the basis, but that these narratives are so legendary and contradictory as to be almost if not wholly, unworthy of credit. 4\\\\. Other Freethinkers believe that Jesus Christ is a pure myth‚Äîthat he never had an existence, except as a Messianic idea, or an imaginary solar deity.\\" Bibliography * Life of Thomas Paine (1880) * The Image Breaker (1882) * False Claims, (1883) * Bible Morals (1884) * Sabbath Breakers (1885) * The Fathers of Our Republic (1886) * Was Lincoln a Christian (1893) * Was Washington a Christian (1899) * The Bible (1901)Remsburg, J.

It provides a range of health services, including inpatient, outpatient, surgical, emergency and mental health services. History The hospital opened in 1954 as a maternity hospital and expanded its services in 1959. At the request of the Government of South Australia, the hospital was named after Queen Elizabeth II, who had recently acceded to the Australian throne. A large portrait of the Queen, together with a letter authorising TQEH name and granting Arms to the Hospital, decorates the principal foyer. Originally designed to service the western suburbs of Adelaide, TQEH is now the second-most utilised hospital in South Australia by patients from the central northern region of Adelaide.Health Service Profiles, Central Northern Adelaide Health Service, Government of South Australia, March 2004 TQEH was the first unit in Australia to perform kidney transplantation successfully, on 21 February 1964. The hospital houses the Australian and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA), which collects national statistics on the treatment of those patients with end-stage kidney failure.ANZDATA website In 2002, Premier Mike Rann, who had campaigned in Opposition against plans to privatise the Hospital, announced a massive ten-year redevelopment of TQEH. In 2005, Premier Rann and Health Minister Lea Stevens unveiled plans for TQEH's second-stage redevelopment. It included construction of a new three-level inpatient building for maternity, surgical, oncology and renal dialysis patients (containing 272 surgical and medical beds), and a 580-place car park building.\\"Queen Elizabeth Hospital's stage two detailed\\", ABC online, 11 Oct 2005 In 2009 Premier Rann opened the new Queen Elizabeth Hospital Research Building, incorporating the Basil Hetzel Institute for Medical Research.\\"Medical Research Powerhouse Opens\\", Daily Telegraph, March 1, 2009 The older Basil Hetzel building which was in use for many decades, was demolished.https://www.hospitalresearch.com.au/wp- content/uploads/2015/07/Research-Report-2004.pdfhttp://xaragmata.dyndns- web.com/album/adelaide/woodvill/qeh/index.html The nurses accommodation wing were also demolished. Redevelopment On the 18th of June 2017, the Weatherill State Government announced plans to build the third stage redevelopment of the hospital, worth over $270 million. The proposed redevelopment included plans to build a new emergency department, more car parking, new outpatient clinics, a new day surgery and operating theatre suite, a new medical imaging suite and a new brain and spinal injury rehabilitation centre, including a hydrotherapy pool, to accommodate patients from Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre. Construction of a new car park is already underway and this required the demolition of the Diabetes centre and a part of the existing car park.

Komatsu was the first general authority of East Asian descent, but was born and raised in the United States. Kikuchi was born on the island of Hokaido. His father served in the military and was killed by American bombing. Kikuchi joined the LDS Church in the late 1950s. As a young man Kikuchi served as a building missionary for the LDS Church.Reid L. Neilson and Van C. Gessel. Taking the Gosepl to the Japanese: 1901 to 2001. (Provo: Brigham Young University Press, 2006) p. 327. After completing his education, he worked for a cookware firm. Later, he worked as the national sales manager for an international company, and eventually operated his own export import company. During this time, Kikuchi was also continuing to serve in the LDS Church, including as president of one of the church's branches in Tokyo. When the Tokyo Stake, the first formed anywhere in Asia was organized, Kikuchi was called as first counselor in the stake presidency.Reid L. Neilson and Vac C. Gessel. Taking the Gospel to the Japanese. Provo: Brigham Young University Press, p. 352. He was later called as the president of the Tokyo Stake. In 1977, Kikuchi was called into full- time church service as a general authority. He became a seventy and member of the First Quorum of the Seventy at the church's October 1977 general conference. After becoming a general authority, Kikuchi was assigned to preside over the affairs of the church in Japan. As area supervisor from 1978 to 1982, Kikuchi promoted rapid proselytizing of local adult converts, especially through baptism, and published graphs in the official Area News that tracked and compared the number of baptisms in each mission. However, as scholar Jiro Numano has noted, these \\"hasty baptisms\\" had negative effects on the church, which encountered difficulty integrating large numbers of newly- baptized converts unschooled in doctrine and practice, and on missionaries, who had to deal with apparently contradictory directions from different church leaders about how and whom to baptize. From 1987 to 1989, Kikuchi served as president of the church's Hawaii Honolulu Mission. In 1987, Kikuchi was a keynote speaker at the first major African-American family history conference sponsored by the LDS Church.[Armaund L. Mauss.

This Brazilian fish is one of the few fish species that live underground in phreatic habitats. It has proved problematic in its classification, which remains uncertain.Muriel-Cunha et al. (2005): page 328 Taxonomy P. cisternarum was collected in 1903 and first described by E. A. Goeldi in 1905.Muriel-Cunha et al. (2005): page 329 This fish species and genus were redescribed in 2005. Distribution and habitat P. cisternarum is found in Brazil. They inhabit underground habitats both north and south of the mouth of the Amazon River as well as the Maraj√≥ Island. This fish inhabits superficial, phreatic habitats, but does not live in the deeper artesian aquifers. These fish are found commonly in hand-dug wells on Maraj√≥. These wells are 4‚Äì13 metres (13‚Äì43 ft) deep. In these wells, these fish are more common during the dry season when the water depth recedes to about 30 centimetres (12 in), and are rarer during the rainy season when the depth can increase by several metres. The water is warm and acidic (pH 5-6). Physical characteristics This small fish reaches a maximum length of SL. There is great variation between members of this species. The head of this species is distinctly wider than the body. The integument is thick and opaque. The lateral line is reduced.Muriel-Cunha et al. (2005): page 330-333 The pelvic fin is highly variable in length between specimens, and can be reduced to finger-like projections. The red coloration is generally uniform over the body and head and is due to superficial blood; this red coloration does not extend to the fins. The fish is darker on the dorsal surface due to some pigmentation in the skin. The barbels are whitish and fade to transparent tips. Ecology P. cisternarum hide and fit tightly within crevices of rocks, where they stay most of the time, leaving only for food.Muriel-Cunha et al. (2005): page 334-336 These fish are not a burrowing species, nor do they hide under vegetative matter, restricting themselves to these crevices. They do not interact much with each other and do not seem to be gregarious. Nothing is known about the reproductive habits of this species. P. cisternarum feed on macro-invertebrates such as worms. They either swallow their prey whole, or take a bite out of it, rolling their body, and twisting a piece off. This firm grip is due to extremely large jaw muscles, which are well adapted to feeding on relatively large prey; worms eaten in captivity can be as long as the fish itself. It is unknown what invertebrates P. cisternarum actually feeds on in its natural habitat. Because food is rare in their environment, these fish are able to survive long periods of starvation, which is partially because of their inactivity. A captive individual did not feed for a year, but remained in good condition. These fish indicate they have some form of respiration that allows them to breathe air, however this behavior is only exhibited under stressful conditions. It is supposed that these fish also have a form of cutaneous respiration, as they are small, live in conditions with low dissolved oxygen, and have high blood circulation to their skin (which provides its red coloration).Muriel-Cunha et al.

Taxonomy For quite some time Phreatobius cisternarum was the only species in the genus. However, two new species were described relatively recently in 2007, Phreatobius dracunculus and Phreatobius sanguijuela. Phreatobius has been classified with a number of different families: Clariidae, Plotosidae, Trichomycteridae, Cetopsidae, and Pimelodidae. Most recently, it has been classified in Heptapteridae. Its phylogenetic position remains uncertain. The family placement of the genus has remained problematic and thus it is not classified in any of the existing families, though Fishbase treats it as a member of Heptapteridae. An undescribed species of Phreatobius lives in waterlogged leaf litter near (not in) streams. Phreatobius walkeri, a nomen nudum, is provided by the Guinness Book of World Records, to describe this fish that stays on land for extended periods of time. Two additional quite distinctive species of Phreatobius, as yet undescribed, are known from the R√≠o Negro basin of Brazil.  Species  There are currently three recognized species in this genus: * Phreatobius cisternarum Goeldi, 1905 * Phreatobius dracunculus Shibatta, Muriel-Cunha & de Pinna, 2007 * Phreatobius sanguijuela L. A. Fern√°ndez, Saucedo, Carvajal- Vallejos & S. A. Schaefer, 2007 Distribution and habitat The three scientifically described Phreatobius species all live underground and are known only from artificial wells penetrating near-surface aquifers of the Amazon basin. The genus has one of the widest distribution of any hypogean fish genus, with P. sanguijuela from the upper Amazon, some 2000 km from reported locations of P. cisternarum near the Amazon River mouth, and P. dracunculus also approximately 1900 km from the Rio Branco drainage area. Description This genus can be recognized by the combination of characteristics, such as their dorsal and anal fins being continuous with a rounded caudal fin, unbranched anal fin rays, a projecting lower jaw, bright red coloration, a lack of the dorsal fin spine locking mechanism, the first pectoral fin ray being soft instead of spinous. Most of these traits are rare or unusual among vast groups of catfish. All three species look extremely similar. However, in P. cisternarum the eyes are tiny, while P. dracunculus and P. sanguijuela lack eyes altogether. The two eyeless species can be differentiated by fin-ray and vertebrae counts. It is also described that P. dracunculus is lighter in color, while P. cisternarum and P. sanguijuela are described as bright red.

She was the sixth daughter of the Elector Palatine, Philip William of Neuburg, and Landgravine Elisabeth Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt. Her sisters became Queen of Spain, Queen of Portugal and Holy Roman Empress. She was regent of the duchy of Parma from 1731 to 1735. Biography Born at the Neuburg Palace, Countess Palatine Dorothea was the fourteenth of seventeen children and her parents' sixth daughter. Her older sisters included: Eleonor Magdalene, consort of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I; Maria Sofia, consort of Peter II of Portugal; Maria Anna, consort of Charles II of Spain; and Elisabeth, daughter-in-law of John III Sobieski, King of Poland. Her brothers included the Electors Palatine Johann Wilhelm and Charles III, each of whom, in turn, succeeded their father; and Francis Louis, Grand Master of the Teutonic Order. On 17 September 1690, she married Odoardo Farnese, Hereditary Prince of Parma, heir to the throne of the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza. The festivities for their wedding were the most splendid that had ever taken place in Parma. In their three years of marriage, they had two children, a son who died in infancy and a daughter, Elisabeth, future Queen of Spain. Her husband died on 6 September 1693, only a month after the death of their son. On 7 December 1696, Dorothea married Odoardo's half-brother, Francesco Farnese, who had become Duke of Parma when his father died in 1694. This marriage was decided by Francesco himself, because he didn't want to give up Dorothea's dowry should she marry someone else. Nevertheless, this marriage remained childless. Francesco died in 1727 and, when his only remaining brother Antonio also died childless in 1731, the Duchy of Parma went to Dorothea's eldest grandchild, the 16-year-old son of Elisabeth Farnese, Charles III of Spain. Dorothea ruled as regent until 1735, when the Duchy was ceded to Austria after the War of the Polish Succession. She died in Parma in 1748 and was buried at the Sanctuary of Santa Maria della Steccata.

Some had been victims of poverty, some had been in prison and were having difficulty returning to mainstream society; others had been battling unsuccessfully against alcohol abuse or drug addiction, and some were suffering from mental illness. The documentary also highlighted the lack of appropriate services such as hostels, drop-in centres and advice services.

Referring to the Spanish Civil War Battle of Jarama the song uses the tune of Red River Valley. The battle was fought from 6‚Äì27 February 1937, in the Jarama river valley a few kilometres east of Madrid. The seasoned troops of Franco's Army of Africa assaulted positions held by the inexperienced volunteers of the International Brigades, in particular the British and the Dimitrov battalions. It ended in stalemate, with both sides entrenching. At the end of three weeks, in particular after a counter-attack on what became known as \\"Suicide Hill\\", the death count was high. The British Battalion lost 225 of its 600 menBeevor (2006), pp 211 & 214. and the Lincoln Battalion lost 125 out of 500. Original four-verse versions The earliest known version of the lyrics was written by Alex McDade, of the British Battalion, XV International Brigade and published in 1938 in The Book of the XV International Brigade by the Commissariat of War, Madrid, 1938.Ryan [1938] (1975), p. 97. It is squarely a soldier's song; grumbling about the boredom, lack of leave and lack of female company. McDade was a labourer from Glasgow who became a political commissar in the XV International Brigade, responsible for the men's welfare.Jump (2006), p. 115. He was wounded at Jarama and died in hospital in Glasgow of wounds sustained 6 July 1937 at the Battle of Brunete. Perhaps McDade wrote the song to focus his comrades' minds on something other than the casualties, but \\"its humorous cynicism made it popular in all battalions\\".Jump (2006), p. 141. Although the provenance of the other early version is unknown it was probably written for (or evolved at) post-war veterans reunions. According to scholar Jim Jump, it was first published on 8 January 1939 in London in a booklet for a British Battalion reunion and \\"has continued to be sung at International Brigade commemorative events\\". {  width=\\"333\\" valign=\\"top\\"  Early version There‚Äôs a valley in Spain called Jarama, That's a place that we all know so well, for 'tis there that we wasted our manhood, And most of our old age as well.

Reunion version There‚Äôs a Valley in Spain called Jarama, It‚Äôs a place that we all know so well, It is there that we gave of our manhood, And so many of our brave comrades fell. We are proud of the British Battalion, And the stand for Madrid that they made, For they fought like true sons of the soil. As part of the Fifteenth Brigade. With the rest of the international column, In the stand for the freedom of Spain We swore in the valley of Jarama That fascism never will reign.

Background It is a celebrated early work by the important church architect G F Bodley, incorporating notable stained glass by William Morris and his company Morris & Co. Bodley was given the commission by Samuel Marling, patriarch of the mill-owning family, who lived in the adjacent Stanley Park House. The church has a distinctive 'saddleback' tower, derived from French Gothic architecture, which was a significant influence on Bodley's early style. Construction took place in 1861-62\\\\. Local labour and contractors were used: Harrison of King's Stanley were the main contractors; stone carvings were undertaken by Joshua Wall; woodwork by William English and ironwork by T.J. Chew. Another source of inspiration for the tower can be found in the parish church of Marling, South Tyrol near the spa city Meran, where Samuel Marling stayed in the 1860s.Gunther Langes: Burggrafenamt und Meran, Athesia Bozen 1990, p.199, . Bodley designed the pews and choir-stalls using poppy- heads and fleur de lys as key motifs, and the font, the inlaid marble pulpit, communion rails and door iron work all show the attention to design that Bodley paid to all aspects of the church. Equally spectacular is the stained glass. Bodley was a friend of William Morris and at Selsley he gave Morris & Co their first commission for ecclesiastical stained glass. Philip Webb provided the scheme for the whole church and the detail of the Creation window at the west end. Edward Burne-Jones, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Ford Madox Brown and Campfield were all involved. Organ The church has a pipe organ by Nicholson dating from 1862. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. Churchyard The churchyard contains war graves of a soldier of World War I and another of World War II.

Joseph Alfred Lamy frog He was born in Mirecourt, Vosges, France, where he apprenticed from 1862 to 1868, and later worked from 1877 to 1885 for Fran√ßois Nicolas Voirin in Paris. He started his apprenticeship in 1862 with Charles Claude Nicolas Husson. In 1868, he joined Gautrot's workshop in Ch√¢teau Thierry, where he met Fran√ßois Nicolas Voirin. In 1876, he came to Paris to work with Fran√ßois Nicolas Voirin, whose assistant he had become. In 1885, at the death of Fran√ßois Nicolas Voirin, he started his own workshop at 34 rue du Faubourg Poissoni√®re. His firstborn son Hippolyte Camille Lamy and nephew Alfred Lamy carried on the family tradition. He branded his bows \\"A. LAMY A PARIS\\". Biography Lamy emerged from a great period in French bowmaking and faithfully carried on the tradition. In 1889 he received the silver and gold medals at the Paris Exposition. His son Hippolyte Camille Lamy-fils, (1876‚Äì1944) carried on in his father's tradition succeeding him at his death in 1919. Like Fran√ßois Nicolas Voirin, Lamy-p√®re was influenced by Jean Baptiste Vuillaume, whose model he frequently used between 1886 and 1890. By 1880 many makers were beginning to consistently aim for an even heavier, stronger model, with varying degrees of success. Lamy's mature period began as early as 1889 to 1890, when he was still only forty. His model, characterized by a slight increase in volume for the sticks as well as for the frogs, became clearer and was adopted definitively. Lamy picked up where Fran√ßois Nicolas Voirin left off, with similar variance in weight and quality of materials. His pupils include Eugene Sartory, whose work he had influenced as well as that of his son, Lamy-fils. \\"Today Lamy (p√®re) is regarded as one of the foremost makers of his generation.\\" ‚Äî Filimonov Fine Violins Joseph Alfred Lamy Head Awards and medals He won the silver and gold Medals at the Paris Exposition in 1889.

Du Cane was born in Ryde on the Isle of Wight in 1825, the son of Charles Du Cane of Braxted Park and Frances Prideaux-Brune. He was educated at Charterhouse School in Surrey and Exeter College, Oxford. From 1848 to 1855, Du Cane played first-class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club as a batsman; a younger brother, Alfred, also played first-class cricket.Charles Du Cane (England), CricInfo. In 1852, he was elected to the House of Commons as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Maldon in Essex, but his election was declared void after it was discovered that Du Cane's agents had been involved in bribery although it was established that Du Cane was unaware of the corruption.Hansard's Parliamentary Debates: House of Commons ‚Äì Maldon Election, Parliament of Great Britain, 18 March 1853. He spent two years as Civil Lord of the Admiralty. At the 1857 general election he was elected as MP for Northern Essex, and held the seat until the division was abolished at the 1868 general election. Du Cane was appointed Governor of Tasmania, and was sworn in at Hobart Town on 15 January 1869. He faced a minor constitutional crisis when the Premier of Tasmania, James Milne Wilson, threatened to resign after a taxation scheme he had proposed was defeated in parliament, which would have left Tasmania without a government, although Wilson withdrew his resignation and a general election took place. Du Cane's tenure in Tasmania saw the colony grow strong and prosperous, partly due to industrial and resources booms and the improvement of communication between Tasmania, the mainland and England. He left Hobart in November 1874, and was appointed KCMG the next year after his return to England. Du Cane died at his family estate in Braxted Park, Essex on 25 February 1889,Rimmer, Gordon.

He was a forward on the boys soccer team and was the city high school player of the year in 1990. In 1991, he entered the University of Virginia where he played as a forward on the men's soccer team until 1994. Although never selected as a first or second team All American, he was named the 1994 SoccerAmerica Player of the Year. The Cavaliers won the NCAA championship each of the four years Wood played. He also holds the NCAA tournament record of 13 goals. International In 1989, he was a member of the U.S. U-16 national team at the U-16 World Cup. While the U.S. went 1‚Äì1‚Äì1 and failed to make the second round, it did defeat Brazil, making it the first U.S. team to do so. Beginning in 1994, Wood became a regular on the United States U-23 men's national soccer team as it prepared for the 1996 Summer Olympics. In 1995, he was a member of the U.S. team which went 0‚Äì3 at the Pan American Games.

His work, although varying greatly over the course of his career, now inclines exclusively towards a study of the human form through the medium of oil paint. Along with Dudley Edwards and David Vaughan, he co-founded the design collective BEV in the 1960s.\\"In Technicolour\\", Harrogate News, 26 Apr 2012. Biography Born in the English city of Bradford in 1941, Binder initially studied at the Bradford College of Art, before moving on to the Royal College of Art in 1961. Painting was his first love within all that the arts had to offer and it was in painting that he found he truly excelled. He was heavily involved in the arts scene of London in the \\"Swinging Sixties\\" and was a regular guest at parties thrown by the glitterazzi of the day. Binder is often seen as the father of pop-psychedelic decor, with the rock group The Beatles being his most famous first customers. Paul McCartney commissioned him to paint his Knight piano. He was also involved with The Roundhouse, a famous London venue that was host to the biggest musical acts of the 1960s and 1970s. With the changes within the field of fine art in the early-1970s, Binder found his work changing, influenced by the pop-culture of the time. In the latter half of the decade, he pursued a developing interest in sculpture. His return to the North of England in the 1980s prompted a renewed interest in oil painting and representation, and for the last ten or fifteen years he has been solely focused upon this particular area. Binder is the curator at the Dean Clough galleries in Halifax, West Riding, and is one of the site's in-situ artists. He is still an active contributor to the galleries but has been reluctant to sell any more than just a few of his works. In September 2007, Binder launched a solo exhibition at York gallery/studio, The ArtSpace. The show, \\"From the Life: New Paintings by Doug Binder\\", ran for three weeks. Binder returned to York in November 2010 when he brought his solo show \\"Full Circle\\" to the same space, renamed from ArtSpace to \\"According to McGee\\".

Graffiti artists across the globe joined forces with Reiss to create the film which features original footage from many controversial graffiti writers beginning with the first graffiti writer Cornbread, to those who saw the take-off of the art, TAKI 183 to more contemporary writers Shepard Fairey and Os Gemeos. In addition to TAKI 183, the film features Tracy 168, Terrible T-Kid 170, Cope2, Stay High 149, KRS-One, Revs, 2esae, Zephyr, Cornbread, DAIM, Blek le Rat, Shuck2, Ash, Skuf, Revok, Ron English, Chaz Bojorquez, Lady Pink, Mear One, Urban Theorists Stefano Bloch (UCLA Dept. of Urban Planning and University of Arizona) and Susan Phillips (Pitzer College), actor and filmmaker Russ Kingston, Pez, Sixe, Falko, Faith47, , Ise, Kenor & Kode, Scage, Mickey, Chino, and Ket. George Kelling, co-author of Broken Windows, an Atlantic Monthly article that formed the basis for Rudy Giuliani's widely imitated gentrification campaign, was interviewed for this film. Reception The New York Times wrote, ‚ÄúBomb It‚Äù isn‚Äôt the first documentary to address the history and evolution of graffiti culture, and it probably won‚Äôt be the last. But what distinguishes Jon Reiss‚Äôs lively, sure-handed film from the rest is that it widens the spectrum by taking a comprehensively international viewpoint.\\" Bomb It 2 The sequel Bomb It 2 (2010) was commissioned as a web series exclusively for the digital broadcast network Babelgum and expands the global reach of Jon Reiss‚Äô exploration of graffiti and street art into new and unexplored areas of Asia and South East Asia, the Middle East as well as Europe, the United States and Australia. Continuing his investigation of the most subversive and controversial art form currently shaping international youth culture, Reiss travelled by himself to Bangkok, Jakarta, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tel Aviv, Palestinian refugee camps on the West Bank, Perth, Melbourne, Copenhagen, Chicago and Austin. Artists featured include Klone, KnowHope, GreatBates, Zero Cents, Foma <3, INSPIRE 1, Darbotz, Killer Gerbil, Bon, Alex Face, Sloke, Husk Mit Navn, Ash, Phibs, Stormie Mills, Beejoir and many more.

It was chosen as the first eukaryotic marine phytoplankton for whole genome sequencing. T. pseudonana was selected for this study because it is a model for diatom physiology studies, belongs to a genus widely distributed throughout the world's oceans, and has a relatively small genome at 34 mega base pairs. Scientists are researching on diatom light absorption, using the marine diatom of Thalassiosira. The diatom requires a high enough concentration of CO2 in order to utilize C4 metabolism, and this positive feedback loop is indicative of how it is responsible for producing 40% of organic carbon for the ocean floor (Clement et al. 2015).Clement, R., Dimnet, L., Maberly, S. C., Gontero, B. 2015. The nature of the CO2‚Äêconcentrating mechanisms in a marine diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana. New Phytologist Trust 209: 1417-1427. An engineered form of the diatom has been considered as a potential drug delivery vehicle for cancer treatment with chemotherapy drugs that are poorly soluble in water. The clone of T. pseudonana that was sequenced is CCMP 1335 and is available from the National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences. This clone was originally collected in 1958 from Moriches Bay (Long Island, New York) and has been maintained continuously in culture.  Symbiosis  Thalassiosira pseudonana and the heterotrophic alphaproteobacterium Ruegeria pomeroyi form a chemical symbiosis in coculture. The bacteria provide vitamin B12 to the diatoms, which in exchange provide organic nutrients to the bacteria. In the presence of the diatom, the bacteria start producing a transporter for dihydroxypropanesulfonate (DHPS), a nutrient produced by the diatom for the bacteria.

The district constitutes the northeastern corner of the country, and is where the Syrian Democratic Council convenes. The town is about west of the Tigris river which defines the triple border between Syria, Turkey and Iraq. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Al-Malikiyah had a population about 40,000 residents in the 2012 census. It is the administrative center of a nahiyah (\\"subdistrict\\") consisting of 108 localities with a combined population of 125,000. The population enjoys demographic and ethnic diversity that is characteristic of most of Al-Hasakah Governorate. The town is inhabited by Kurds, Assyrians, Arabs and Armenians. Etymology There are two theories on the local Syriac and Kurdish name of the city. The first theory is that the city is named after an ancient monastery ('dayr' in Syriac) located in its vicinity, while the second one argues that the name \\"D√™rik\\" stems from the Kurdish word du rek meaning 'two roads'. In 1957, the town was named \\"Al-Malikiyah\\", after a Syrian army officer Adnan al-Malki. In 1977, a decree was issued to ban all non-Arabic place names. Therefore the Kurdish and Syriac-Aramaic names were banned from being used. History The town's indigenous people are Assyrians who trace their ancestry to many Turkish villages in (Tur Abdin) whose inhabitants fled to Syria and established the city after the Assyrian Genocide. Assyrians began to emigrate from the area after they were targeted by local Kurds in the Amuda massacre of August 9, 1937. Even though it failed, fear, anxiety and the immigration of Kurds from Turkey led to Malikiya, Darbasiya and Amuda becoming predominantly Kurdish. , Al-Malikiyah is the fifth largest city in Al-Hasakah governorate. =Syrian Civil War= As a result of the ongoing Syrian Civil War, Al-Malikiyah is currently controlled by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria. On 21 July 2012, YPG forces reportedly captured Al-Malikiyah, which is located just 10 kilometers from the Turkish border, although another report stated that fighting was still going on in the city. On 22 July, it was reported that Kurdish forces were still fighting for Al-Malikiyah and one young Kurdish activist was killed after government security forces allegedly opened fire on protesters. In November 2012, Syrian government forces withdrew from the city. Kurdish-led authorities consequently installed the \\"D√™rik prison\\" for captured Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) members in al-Malikiyah. In April 2019, the prison was the site of a major prison escape attempt by about 200 ISIL detainees, including several French jihadists. The breakout was foiled, however, and some of the prisoners were subsequently distributed to other detention centers. In May 2020, reports emerged that Russia is building a new military base in Qeser Dib, a village outside of al-Malikiyah. Demographics In 2004, the population of Al-Malikiyah was 26,311. The population consists mostly of ethnic Kurds and Assyrians in addition to a significant, large number of Arabs and a smaller number of Armenians. The northern half of the town is mainly inhabited by Muslim Kurds, and the southern part by Assyrians and Armenians. As the economic center of the district, the town is usually filled with people from the surrounding villages and towns, especially during the morning hours. Al-Malikiyah has seen a dramatic urban expansion and real estate development in recent years which led to many streets being extended to new neighborhoods that are now part of the continually growing town. As of November 2014, only 200 ethnic Armenians remain in the city out of a pre-civil war figure of 450.

It is part of the Library. Sydney University Press was founded as a traditional university press and operated as such from 1962 to 1987. It was re-established in 2003 under the management of the University of Sydney Library to meet the new challenges of scholarly communication in the networked environment. History As early as 1939, a Sydney University Press was being advocated by Dr. R. S. Wallace, then Vice Chancellor of the University. Some years later in May 1947, Laurie Fitzhardinge, a professor at Sydney University, went to London to investigate the possibility of starting up the Sydney University Press. The original Sydney University Press was established by the University in 1962. University by-law at the time enshrined its objectives: \\"...the objects of Sydney University Press shall be to undertake the publication of works of learning and to carry out the business of publication in all its branches\\". The Press was effectively dismantled in 1987 to become, for a time, an imprint of Oxford University Press until the mid-1990s when Oxford University Press relinquished the imprint and business name. During this relatively brief period of time Sydney University Press published several hundred books and many journals representing scholarship at the University and beyond. These publications included major works by many of the University's leading scholars such as JM Ward, Butlin, Turney, Wilkes, K Campbell, J Young, Wolnizer, Jeans, Meaney, and Webby. It included series such as the Challis Shakespeare, Australian Literary Reprints, and journals such as Journal of Industrial Relations, Mankind, Australian Economic History Review, Abacus, and Pathology. The output of Sydney University Press represented the breadth, and the best, of the University of Sydney. Current activities Sydney University Press publishes 20-25 new titles each year. SUP's publishing scope includes Australian history, literature, biography, urban planning, social policy, public health and social issues. Books need to have an Australian focus or relevance to Australia. The majority of SUP's authors are Australian, but not necessarily from the University of Sydney. SUP also publishes a few titles related to activities on campus. These include the annual student anthology edited by a group of volunteers from the Master of Publishing degree (Threads 2007, Cellar Door 2008, Margins 2009, Sandstone 2010) and the creative writing journals from the University of Sydney Union, ARNA and Phoenix. SUP has also published a number of official and unofficial histories from the University, including 150 Years of the Faculty of Medicine, 150 Years 150 Firsts: People of the Faculty of Medicine, Sydney University Sport 1852-2007: more than a club, 50 Great Moments: Celebrating the Golden Jubilee of the University of Sydney's Electron Microscope Unit; and Educating for business, public service and the social sciences: A history of the Faculty of Economics at the University of Sydney 1920-1999. Australian literature SUP has used a number of CAL Cultural Fund grants to improve access to out-of- print Australian literature. In 2003, 25 Australian novels were brought back into print under the Classic Australian Works series. In 2009, a new series, the Australian Classics Library was commenced. Twelve titles, chosen by Professor Robert Dixon and Emeritus Professor Bruce Bennett, had new introductions written to reposition them for the scholarly and education markets. In 2009, Resourceful Reading: The New Empiricism, eResearch and Australian Literary Culture was released, containing a series of essays on emerging research into literary theory and the use of digital technology in the humanities.

History In 1838 al-Mukharram was classified as a khirba (\\"ruined\\" or \\"abandoned\\" village\\") in the District of Salamiyah.Smith, 1841, p. 177. The general region of the desert plains east of Homs and Hama was repopulated during the late 19th century by local Bedouins and by Ismaili and Alawite peasants from the areas west of Homs and Hama, as well as Circassians. The modern town was of al-Mukharram was founded in 1882, although its inhabitants struggled to make a living off the semi-arid region.Mattar, Kinan. First Almond Festival in Al-Mukharram. E-Homs. E-Syria. 2010-05-06. In 1960, al-Mukharram was still an impoverished village populated by Alawite sharecropper families employed by landlords based in Homs. Under these circumstances, the Syrian Army provided an attractive alternative for the men of the village to advance socially and economically. Various figures from the town have served in high-ranking positions in the Syrian military and security apparatus, including Muhammad Umran, former Defense Minister (early 1966),Batatu, 1999, p. 147. whose father had been a religious shaykh and a local leader of the town. Other notable Syrian military figures from al- Mukharram include Ahmed Sa'id Salih, the former Chief of Political Security (1970-1987) and deputy Interior Minister, Adnan Badr Hassan, another former Chief of Political Security (1987-2002),Batatu, 1999, p. 222. and Abd al-Karim al-Razzuq the late 1970s commander of the missile corps and the air defense forces.Batatu, 1999, p. 220. In 1968, al-Mukharram became the capital of the district that has since shared its name, taking the place of Jubb al-Jarrah, the former district center. Although the village's population was only 2,170 in 1970, well below the government-designated threshold required to become a district seat, the close relationship between the residents and the security establishment allowed for al-Mukharram to be promoted to is current role, according to anthropologist Fabrice Balanche. The old city of al-Mukharram remains a commercial and residential area. The modern city contains a number of schools and community colleges, a weather station, a large carpet- production factory and a large warehouse for storing animal seeds. Agriculture and raising livestock, namely cattle and sheep, constitutes a major sector of al-Mukharram's economy. Grains are cultivated in the dry lands, vegetables in the plains, and olives, grapes, pistachios and almonds in irrigated lands in the hilly parts of the city. The chief agricultural products are olives and almonds.Ibrahim, Shadi. Al-Mukharram: An Oasis in the Heart of the Desert. E-Homs. E-Syria. 2010-05-10. The latter crop has become the object of celebration, with residents holding an annual \\"Almond Festival\\" since 2010. Geography Al-Mukharram is situated on a plain along the western fringes of the Syrian Desert, east of the central Orontes River valley. It is located northeast of Homs, the governorate capital, and south of Salamiyah. Al- Mukharram's old city sits on the Tell al-Shayb hill, while the modern town has expanded up to from and around the hill. The city's area consists of some 600 hectares. Nearby localities include al-Mukharram al-Tahtani to the northwest, Uthmaniyah to the north, Abu Hakfah al-Janubi to the northeast, Sankari and Jubb al-Jarrah to the east, Umm Jabab and Umm Tuwaynah to the south and Umm al-Amad and Buwaydat Salamiyah to the west. =Archaeology= In a residential area of the city exists a cone-shaped domed structure built from mud brick and stone. It has a height of and a diameter of . The structure has a wooden door and 13 square or triangle-shaped openings in the upper portion of the dome. It is currently used as a stable or barn and a home has been built adjacent to it. The oldest part of al-Mukharram is built on a tell (archaeological mound), and there are several other tells to the northeast. Demographics According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), al-Mukharram had a population of 6,202 in the 2004 census. It is the administrative center and largest locality in the al-Mukharram nahiyah (\\"subdistrict\\") which consisted of 30 localities with a collective population of 32,447 in 2004.General Census of Population and Housing 2004.

The earliest known version of the tune is in William Christie's Tradition Ballad Airs, Volume 2 (1881), but there is another tune, of Irish origin. There is an obvious difficulty in identifying the narrator's voice. It is a conversation between Napoleon's son (Napoleon II, 1811-1832, named King of Rome by his father upon birth) and his mother (Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma, Napoleon's second wife, whom he married after divorcing Josephine). The sentiment is sympathetic to Napoleon but is also patriotic. Napoleon was defeated because he failed to beware of the 'bonny bunch of roses' - England, Scotland and Ireland whose unity cannot be broken. The Irish, who were themselves in an unequal union with Britain during the 18th and 19th centuries, were divided in their attitudes towards Napoleon Bonaparte. Many thousands of Irishmen served in the British Army during the Napoleonic Wars in both in English and Scottish regiments and in Irish ones like the Connaught Rangers and the Inniskilling Dragoons for example, many of them giving their lives in the struggle against Napoleon and displaying much valour in the process. However, at the same time, Napoleon knew that among certain people there was some bitterness towards British rule in Ireland, much as there was towards French rule in his native Corsica, as he well knew. Thus he decided to emulate the British in their support of Corsican rebels against Revolutionary France by supporting an heroic but ultimately doomed Irish rebellion, inspired by the egalitarian principles of the Enlightenment, which has come to be known as the 1798. With this in mind, it should perhaps come as no great surprise then if Napoleon's bravery captivated the imagination of a segment of the Irish population, nor his defiance even in defeat. United Irishmen and their sympathisers it can perhaps be deduced also adored the tragic story of the romance between the doomed emperor and his second wife, Marie Louise, which would explain why her words tell the story of Bonaparte's fall. On the other hand, the song stresses the unity of the English, Scots and Irish, suggesting acknowledgement of a common British identity in opposition to France and Napoleon among the soldiers from those three nations at the time.  Lyrics  The lyrics below are from 1881.Folkinfo page, with musical notation :Near by the swelling ocean, :One morning in the month of June, :While feather'd warbling songsters :Their charming notes did sweetly tune, :I overheard a lady :Lamenting in sad grief and woe, :And talking with young Bonaparte :Concerning the bonny Bunch of Roses, O. :Thus spake the young Napoleon, :And grasp'd his mother by the hand:- :\\"Oh, mother dear have patience, :Till I am able to command; :I'll raise a numerous army, :And through tremendous dangers go, :And in spite of all the universe, :I'll gain the bonny Bunch of Roses, O.\\" :Oh, son, speak not so venturesome; :For England is the heart of oak; :Of England, Scotland, and Ireland, :The unity can ne'er be broke. :And think you on your father, :In the Island where he now lies low, :He is not yet interred in France; :So beware of the bonny Bunch of Roses, O. :Your father raised great armies, :And likewise kings did join the throng; :He was so well provided. :Enough to sweep the world along. :But when he went to Moscow, :He was o'erpower'd by drifting snow; :And though Moscow was blazing :He lost the bonny Bunch of Roses, O. :\\"Oh, mother, adieu for ever, :I am now on my dying bed, :If I had liv'd I'd have been brave :But now I droop my youthful head. :And when our bones do moulder, :And weeping-willows o'er us grow, :Its deeds to bold Napoleon :Will stain the bonny Bunch of Roses, O.\\"  Recorded versions  There are many recorded versions, including the Chieftains (with Dolores Keane as the singer), De Dannan, Fairport Convention, Glen Campbell, Harry Cox, Ewan MacColl, Cyril Poacher, S√©amus Ennis, Nic Jones, S√©an Garvey, Maddy Prior and June Tabor in collaboration with the Oysterband, and John Wesley Harding.

Jarabulus ( / ALA-LC: JarƒÅbulus; , , Aleppo dialect: JrƒÅblos) is a Syrian city administratively belonging to Aleppo Governorate. Jarabulus, also known as Jerablus, lies on the western bank of the river Euphrates. In the 2004 census, the city had a population of 11,570. The population has increased significantly during the Syrian civil war. Ethnically, the population of city is composed of Arabs and Turkmens. It is located north of Lake Assad, just south of the Syria‚ÄìTurkey border and the Turkish town of Karkamƒ±≈ü.  History  In the Bronze and Iron Ages, the archaeological site lying just north of Jarabulus (half of which is now in Turkey) was called \\"Karkemish\\", in Greek and Roman times the ancient name of the city was \\"Europos\\" (Œï·ΩêœÅœâœÄœåœÇ), which must have been at the origin of the modern form of the toponym Jerabis. The original 18th century form of the toponym seems to have been \\"Djerabis\\", later found however as \\"Djeraboolos\\" or \\"Djerablus\\", probably deriving from Hierapolis (modern-day Manbij, to the South-West). Being on the southern side of the Istanbul-Baghdad railway, Jarabulus became a border town with Turkey based on the Treaty of Lausanne in the aftermath of World War I. Following the outbreak of the Syrian civil war, the Syrian opposition took over it along with its border post with Turkey on July 20, 2012. However from early July 2013 the town was controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.The Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham Expands Into Rural Northern Syria Joshualandis.com, 18 July 2013The secret jihadi smuggling route through Turkey CNN, 5 November 2013 By January 2014, rebels mainly from the al-Tawhid Brigade engaged in clashes with ISIL and seized the town, but ISIL was able to recapture it within hours. An article published by The Guardian said that attempts by the People's Protection Units (YPG) to capture Jarabulus were prevented by President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, who, according to media reports, had threatened in 2015 to attack the YPG using Turkish Armed Forces if they moved against Jarabulus. This threat secured ISIL control of the town. = Operation Euphrates Shield = On 24 August 2016 around 4:00 AM (local time), Turkey-backed rebels and the Turkish Land Forces launched a military operation into Syria. The operation was supported by the Turkish Air Force along with US-led coalition aircraft in an attempt to clear a passage for the troops. By 24 August, Jarabulus and neighboring towns were captured by the Syrian National Army. The SNA, backed by Turkish tanks, then connected Jarablus to al-Rai to push ISIL forces away from the Turkish border.  Governance  Jarabulus Military Council 2016 On 6 September 2016, the Karkamƒ±≈ü-based council of Jarabulus that had been constituted 2 years prior, accused Turkey of attempting to replace them with a newly formed council consisting of pro- Turkish Turkmen separatists. The Sultan Murad Division denied the accusations and accused the local council of being PYD \\"collaborators\\", although it did confirm forming a \\"council of elders\\" in the city. Harakat Nour al-Din al- Zenki's political leader Yasser Ibrahim al-Yusuf, son of the perpetrator of the Aleppo Artillery School massacre, also said that the city would be governed by a newly formed council. The head of the Syrian Interim Government based in Turkey, Jawad Abu Hatab, has met with the Jarabulus local council on the same day.  Security  On 22 January 2017, 450 members of a police force trained and equipped by Turkey were deployed in Jarabulus. The Jarabulus police is headed by defected Syrian Army brigadier general Abdel Razaq Aslan.  Education  Following the capture of Jarabulus by the Turkish Armed Forces from the Islamic State, children returned to school, but are learning Turkish as a foreign language instead of French. In October 2018, the Gaziantep University opened a vocational school in Jarabulus. Electric infrastructure After the Turkish operation in August and September 2016, Turkish authorities planned the building of a cable from Karkamƒ±≈ü to Jarabulus in order to restore electricity in the city, with being in Syrian territory. The electricity and potable water will be provided for free to the residents of Jarabulus. On 26 September, following the visits of Turkish officials from Gaziantep Municipality including its mayor, Jarabulus was connected to the Turkish electrical power grid. A former school in Jarabulus was turned into a hospital and started servicing and was seen with an official Turkish sign reading \\"Turkish Ministry of Health - Jarablus Hospital\\" with a flag of Turkey. Climate Jarabulus has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Csa), with influences of a continental climate during winter, hot dry summers, and cool wet and occasionally snowy winters. The average high temperature in January is and the average high temperature in August is . The snow falls usually in January, February or December.

Most of the city's Turkmen residents have fled as a result of the ongoing Syrian civil war. People in the city depend on trade and public services as the main source of income. It has six mosques and two main small squares: Al Hurria and Al Saha Al Amma Squares. History During the Ottoman era, between the 18th and 19th centuries, Talkalakh was home to the wealthy and influential Danadisha (also spelled Dandashi) clan.Douwes, 2000, p. 113. They stiffly competed with Hammadi family and the al-Jundi family of Homs and Hama.Douwes, 2000, p. 84. =Syrian civil war= On May 15, 2011, as a part of the Syrian civil war, the Syrian Army shelled Talkalakh in response to attacks on the army that occurred a day before in the city. Seven civilians were killed and at least 2,000 residents tried to flee from the city into Lebanon. A resident claimed that Shabiha militias were targeting the Sunni inhabitants, assuring that \\"The city of Talkalakh is empty of people. Most of them have fled to Lebanon,\\". The remainder of its Sunni residents continued protesting against the government hoping to topple the Alawite-dominated government. On 12 February 2013, a CNN report from inside Talkalakh revealed that the town itself was under rebel control, though government forces were only a matter of yards away, surrounding the town. Nevertheless, there was no fighting in or around the town thanks to a tenuous ceasefire between the warring sides brokered by a local sheikh and an Alawite member of parliament. The ceasefire ended in June 2013, when government forces drove out the rebels and took control of the town.

The Clan Gregor (or MacGregor) and Clan Colquhoun were at feud due to the MacGregors carrying out raids on the Colquhoun's lands. The Colquhouns gained royal support and raised an army against the MacGregors. However, during the subsequent battle of Glen Fuin, the Colquhouns were comprehensively defeated. Glen Fruin is located in the Loch Lomond area, in the county of Dunbartonshire, Scotland. In the aftermath of the battle royal policy punished the MacGregors for 150 years. Background Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll was responsible for keeping the Clan Gregor under restraint and in January 1593 he had received a commission to charge all those of the surname MacGregor for not keeping the peace. On 5 March 1594 he became bound so that he should keep himself and all those answerable to him to keep his Majesty's peace under surety of ¬£20,000. In July 1596, upon paying a sum of money into the royal treasury, he received a commission as the King's lieutenant in the bounds of Clan Gregor \\"wherever situated\\". Subsequently, on 22 April 1601 Allaster MacGregor of Glenstra, chief of Clan Gregor, gave Argyll who was the King's lieutenant, a bail-bond for the whole clan, one clause of which was that any offence committed by the clan was to be understood as a forfeiture of any lands that they possessed. However, despite this, Argyll, instead of repressing the Clan Gregor used his power over them to stimulate them into various acts of aggression against Alexander Colquhoun of Luss, chief of Clan Colquhoun. Among the Luss Papers, there are lists of items stolen by the MacGregors from the Colquhous in the year 1594 and in other years previous to this up to 1600, showing how much the Colquhouns had suffered from the MacGregors. In 1602 the MacGregors began to make more formidable inroads into the lands of Luss and Colquhoun of Luss complained to King James VI of Scotland who despite having passed an Act of Parliament forbidding the carrying of arms, granted permission to Colquhoun and his tenants to wear various offensive weapons. However, the right granted to Colquhoun and his followers to carry arms seems to have caused resentment from the MacGregors and resulted in the conflicts at both Glenfinlas and Glen Fruin. In 1602, Colquhoun made a complaint to the King against Argyll, who as the King's lieutenant in the bounds of Clan Gregor, had permitted the latter and others to commit outrages upon him and his tenants. Argyll was fined under the terms of the bond, but was later acquitted of the charge brought against him because Colquhoun had failed to prove it. =Glenfinlas= On 7 December 1602, at Glenfinlas, which is a glen about two miles west of Rossdhu and three miles to the north of Glen Fruin which runs parallel to it, a raid was carried out led by Duncan Mackewin MacGregor, tutor of Glenstra, against the Colquhouns. He had with him about eighty men and they plundered the houses and took away three hundred cows, one hundred horses and mares, four hundred sheep and four hundred goats. Two Colquhouns were killed in the raid, one of them a house-hold servant of Colquhoun of Luss. According to the Clan Gregor account, based on Walter Scott's supposed factual introduction to his 19th century novel Rob Roy (MacGregor); two MacGregor clansmen, away from home, were forced to spend a night in Colquhoun lands. After being refused shelter, the two MacGregors found an abandoned outhouse and slaughtered a sheep which they ate. When the two were discovered they were seized and brought forward to Colquhoun, the Laird of Luss who had the men tried by summary trial and then executed. Walter Scott also gives this incident as the direct cause of the conflict at Glen Fruin. 19th century historian William Fraser disputes the account given by 17th century historian Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet in his Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland who strongly favors the MacGregors, representing the Colquhouns as the aggressors and that the Colquhuns had made the first raid. Fraser also states that Gordon mistakes the conflict at Glenfinlas for the more serious one at Glen Fruin which took place shortly after. According to Fraser, Colquhoun of Luss visited the King at Stirling on 21 December 1602, accompanied by a number of female relatives of the people who had been killed or wounded at Glenfinlas and who were carrying the bloodied shirts of their dead or wounded relatives. The King was sympathetic and vowed to take vengeance on the MacGregors. He granted a commission of lieutenancy to Colquhoun of Luss giving him the power to repress the crimes made against him and to apprehend the perpetrators. This however roused the MacGregors to raise a strong force against the Colquhouns. Fraser also disputes Gordon's contemporary account that in early 1603 the MacGregors and Colquhouns made friendly proposals to hold conference to find a peaceful settlement, again favouring the MacGregors, but Fraser says that there is no evidence to show that this conference ever took place, let alone that at the end of it the Colquhouns treacherously attacked the MacGregors as stated by Gordon. Fraser states that at this time the town council of Dumbarton issued an order for the burgesses to be provided with weapons and armour in readiness, no doubt, for the Clan Gregor. The conflict at Glen Fruin Allaster MacGregor of Glenstra, at the head of a large body of his clan, which also included men from the Clan Cameron, all armed with hagbuts, pistols, murrions, mailcoats, axes, two-handed swords, darlochs and other weapons, advanced into the territory of Colquhoun of Luss. At the time there was no road on the Loch Long side, the present road apparently built at a later date by the Duke of Argyll and called The Duke's Road. However, there was a track or path of some kind along the side of Loch Long which may have been the way that the MacGregors came into Glen Fruin. To repel the invaders Colquhoun gathered together a considerable force of armed men, who under the royal commission, he had raised to protect the district and punish the MacGregors. The two sides met on 7 February 1603 at Glen Fruin. The MacGregors have been estimated as numbering between 300 and 400 foot soldiers. The Colquhouns have been estimated as numbering about 300 horse and 500 foot. The ground on which the battle took place was extremely unfavourable to the Colquhouns, especially for their horse. The MacGregors had assembled in two divisions, one was at the head of the glen and the other was placed in an ambush position near to the farm of Strone. The Colquhouns entered Glen Fruin from the Luss side through the glen of Auchengaich which is opposite Strone. Colquhoun pushed on his force to get through the glen before encountering with the MacGregors, but they were already aware of his approach and Allaster MacGregor pushed forward one of his divisions and entered the head of the glen in time, to prevent the Colquhouns from emerging out of the upper end of the glen. Meanwhile, his brother, John MacGregor, with the ambush division took a detour to the rear of the Colquhouns which prevented their retreat back through the glen without fighting their way through. The Colquhouns also least expected to be attacked from the rear. Allaster MacGregor, at the head of his division furiously charged Colquhoun of Luss and his men. The Colquhouns bravely maintained the contest for a while. Fraser disputes other accounts of the battle which say that the MacGregors only lost two men killed. However, due to the unfavorable circumstances in which they had to fight, the Colquhouns were unable to maintain their ground and fell into the moss at the farm of Auchengaich where they were thrown into disorder. Here, on the moss, Colquhoun's cavalry was useless. The MacGregors killed many of them and forced them into a retreat in which they had to fight through John MacGregor's division which proved even more disastrous. However, according to the Clan Gregor account, John MacGregor who was the chief's brother was killed in the battle.MacGregor, Amelia Georgiana Murray (1898). p. 206. Alexander Colquhoun, the chief, was chased all the way to Rossdhu Castle which afforded him some refuge. According to Fraser, 140 Colquhouns were killed in the battle and many more were wounded. Other sources state that over 200 Colquhouns were killed. Aftermath Government reprisals included the proscription of the Clan Gregor, who were outlawed for the massacre. King James sought to make the Highlands and Islands \\"answerable to God, justice and himself\\" and to assimilate them into his new Britain. One of the most radical manifestations of this new programme was the extermination of the MacGregors. Their chief, Allaster MacGregor, was executed in 1604,Keay, John; Keay, Julia (1994). p. 489. along with eleven of his chieftains,Way, George of Plean; Squire, Romilly of Rubislaw (1994). p. 221. and in 1633 it became legal to kill MacGregors and hunt them with bloodhounds. The Clan Gregor was scattered with many taking other surnames such as Murray or Grant. Charles II restored the MacGregor name in 1661, but in 1693 it was once again disallowed by William of Orange. In 1784 the MacGregors were allowed to resume their own name and were finally restored to all of the rights and privileges of British citizens. In 1609, John Murray, 1st Earl of Tullibardine, had apprehended one Alan Oig Mcan Tuagh in Glen Coe who was one of the principal executors of the slaughter committed by the Clan Gregor at the Battle of Glen Fruin and who with his own hand had slew forty people who were \\"without armour\\". At the end of the eighteenth century the chiefs of Clan Gregor and Clan Colquhoun visited and shook hands on the site of the slaughter at Glen Fruin. Alleged slaughter of students There is a tradition that after the battle the victorious MacGregors slaughtered a group of clerical students who had come to watch it, but this story is not supported by historical records. The tradition is that the MacGregors murdered about eighty youths in this incident. It is alluded to in the supposed factual introduction to Walter Scott's novel Rob Roy in which it says that the culprits were from the Clan MacFarlane, allies of the MacGregors. Music and poetry associated with the battle The poet David Wardlaw Scott alluded to the chief of MacGregors, chief of Colquhouns and the Battle of Glen Fruin in his poem Dora Marcelli, The Last of Her Race. The writer Peter McArthur composed a ballad entitled The Raid of Glen Fruin in memory of the battle. Archaeology In July 1967, an excavation took place on a mound in Glen Fruin that was thought to be the burial place of the Colquhouns who were killed in the battle. However, it was discovered that the mound was not the burial site of the Colquhouns but a Bronze Age encampment. There is also a grey stone in the glen where it is believed that John MacGregor, the chief's brother, who was one of the few slain on the other side was buried.

Situated at an altitude of above sea level on the Orontes river, the city was inhabited by 44,322 people in 2010. History Jisr ash-Shugur has long been an important stopping point on trade routes and is situated on the main route between Latakia, to the west and Aleppo to the east. Located in the rich alluvial plain of the Ghab valley on the eastern side of the An- Nusayriyah Mountains (also known as the Jebel Ansariye), the area has been continuously inhabited for over 10,000 years. The ancient city of Qarqar is thought to have been situated some south of the modern town, which was established in Hellenistic times as the city of Seleucia ad Belum. The Romans called it Niaccuba and built a stone bridge there across the Orontes. Little remains of the ancient city other than portions of the much-repaired Roman bridge, which is now incorporated into a 15th-century Mameluke construction that still serves as one of the city's two bridges over the river. The bridge's V-shaped design was intended to enable it to withstand the force of the river's current. Although Jisr ash-Shugur is mostly of modern construction, a number of old Ottoman-era buildings still survive including a caravanserai built in the centre of the old town between 1660‚Äì75 and restored in 1826‚Äì27. The city has been described as conservative and predominately Sunni Muslim with a history of unrest against the government of the ruling secular Arab nationalist Baath party.Has Syria's peaceful uprising turned into an insurrection?, By Nicholas Blanford, / csmonitor.com June 9, 2011 It was the scene of a mass killing by Syrian security forces in 1980 that prefigured the later and more notorious Hama massacre. On 9 March 1980, against a background of anti-government protests across Syria, inhabitants of Jisr ash- Shugur marched on the local Ba'ath Party headquarters and set it on fire. The police were unable to restore order and fled. Some demonstrators seized weapons and ammunition from a nearby army barracks. Later that day, units of the Syrian Army Special Forces were helicoptered in from Aleppo to regain control, which they did after pounding the town with rockets and mortars, destroying homes and shops and killing and wounding dozens of people. At least two hundred people were arrested. The following day a military tribunal ordered the execution of more than a hundred of the detainees. In all, about 150‚Äì200 people were said to have been killed. =Syrian Civil War= The Mujahideen Battalion, a unit of the Free Syrian Army, announces its formation in Jisr al-Shughur, March 2012. Violence broke out in Jisr ash-Shugur on 4 June 2011, three months into the Syrian civil war. Armed groups attacked local security forces, killed 120 members of the security forces and seized control of the city, with many civilians fleeing to Latakia. Activists speaking to BBC denied the government's version of events, claiming that the deaths were unclear and that they might be killed by their own side for mutiny. The Syrian military launched an operation in a crackdown against the claimed armed groups. The operation lasted until 12 June 2011. The city was reported to have been largely abandoned by its inhabitants, many of whom fled to neighbouring Turkey, as Syrian Army units massed outside to retake it. In December 2011‚ÄìJanuary 2012, FSA took control, establishing a key rebel center. ln June 2012, the FSA was still in control. In October 2012, the Syrian government was reported by Al Jazeera to be in control of the town. However, on 25 April 2015, the city was captured by an alliance of Salafist insurgents, including al-Qaeda's al-Nusra Front, Ahrar al-Sham, and the Turkistan Islamic Party. The city has become a stronghold of the TIP, and reportedly 3,500 Uyghurs have since settled in the city. By July 2017, the city was under joint control of Tahrir al-Sham and the Turkistan Islamic Party.

He was in charge of standard gauge steam locomotives for the Great Western Railway at Stafford Road Works, Wolverhampton from 1864 to 1897. He was the younger brother of his colleague Joseph Armstrong, but thanks to the special requirements of the GWR at a time when it was split in two by the broad and standard gauges, the brothers were able to work largely independently of each other. George is best remembered for his 0-4-2 and 0-6-0 tank engines; these were long-lived, and even when life-expired they were replaced by Collett and Hawksworth with remarkably similar locomotives, the well-known 1400, 5700 and 1600 classes. Biography George Armstrong was born on 5 April 1822. His gravestone states that the place was Bewcastle, Cumberland, and this information is repeated by Marshall. However, Holcroft writes that the family went to Canada in 1817, not returning until 1824, and that consequently George was born overseas. It was presumably in 1824 that the family took up residence near Newcastle at Newburn-on-Tyne, a few miles from George Stephenson's birthplace and at that time at the centre of avant-garde steam locomotive engineering. George later recalled chasing the famous locomotive Puffing Billy on the Wylam Waggonway, and how this inspired him to become an engine driver. With the exception of two visits to France, George's engineering career followed very much in the footsteps of his brother Joseph, who was five years older than he was. At the age of 14 he started work at nearby Walbottle Colliery, which at that time was a horse waggonway with stationary engines to haul trains up the inclines. Here he worked for the engineer Robert Hawthorn. In 1840 George and Joseph went to Hull as engineers on the Hull and Selby Railway, then subsequently followed John Gray to Brighton Works on the London and Brighton. At that time British engineering know-how was much in demand on the Continent, and from Brighton George crossed the Channel in order to work for a period on the Northern Railway (Nord) of France. He later recalled how during the Revolution of 1848 he was compelled by the gendarmes to assist in erecting a barricade in the streets of Paris. Unhappy with the unsettled politics of France, he returned to his brother's side. By now Joseph was assistant locomotive superintendent to Edward Jeffreys, on the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway (S&CR;), whose repair works was at Saltney near Chester, and George became an engine driver on the S&CR;, subsequently being promoted to locomotive foreman. In 1853 the S&CR; pooled its locomotive fleet with that of the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway, and Joseph moved south to new, larger locomotive works at Wolverhampton (Stafford Road). The following year the two brothers became employees of the Great Western Railway when the Shrewsbury & Chester, along with other standard gauge lines, were amalgamated with the mostly broad gauge GWR. Wolverhampton's task at first was to keep the miscellaneous stock of the various standard gauge lines in working order, but from 1858 Joseph Armstrong was ready to start constructing new locomotives there. George became his assistant and works manager. Between about 1855 and 1863 a talented young engineer named William Dean served his apprenticeship at Wolverhampton. When in 1864 Sir Daniel Gooch retired as locomotive superintendent at Swindon, Joseph was transferred to Swindon to succeed him, and George Armstrong stepped into his brother's shoes at Wolverhampton. Dean remained at Wolverhampton for the time being, as George's assistant. Because the Great Western now had in effect two independent locomotive works, the scene was set for a difficult personal situation, George Armstrong and William Dean being de facto rivals for the post of Joseph's assistant at Swindon. Appointing George would have smacked of nepotism; furthermore, Dean's youth (he was 18 years younger than George) counted in his favour as, in time, a potential successor. It was with this delicate situation in mind that Joseph decided to continue to give his brother a largely free hand not only in the design of Wolverhampton's locomotives, but even the way they were painted. (Swindon livery was leaf green with black and yellow lining, Wolverhampton's a blue-green shade, lined out in black and white.) Joseph Armstrong duly summoned the 28-year-old Dean to Swindon in 1868, and nine years later on Armstrong's death Dean was appointed as his successor. George Armstrong's rugged northern character made itself felt - \\"he didn't give a damn for any man and was taking orders from none. He only gave orders!\\" he is said to have remarked - and once more he was left to get on with his work undisturbed - for another twenty years, as it would turn out. One of George's responsibilities was to oversee the running of the royal train as far as the junction with the London and North Western Railway at Bushbury, when Victoria was travelling to or from Scotland; a duty that he undertook more than 120 times. In 1870 he travelled to France again, in order to give engineering advice in the course of the Franco-Prussian War. Once again he found himself participating in a way he disliked, being compelled to defend Paris's city walls with a rifle. This time he resisted the gendarmes in the course of what he evidently recounted as a comic tug-of-war. George finally retired in 1897, a venerable and much loved GWR character. He died after a fall at a Wolverhampton floral fete on 11 July 1901. He is buried at St. Mary's Church, Bushbury, Wolverhampton(close to the church hall). He was unmarried. Locomotives Apart from rebuilds and renewals of engines built elsewhere, according to Holcroft George Armstrong built relatively few tender engines, all of the 2-4-0 and 0-6-0 wheel arrangements and dating from his first years in charge at Wolverhampton. After that the Works concentrated almost exclusively on tank engines of the 0-6-0 and 0-4-2 types, saddle tanks at first, then side tanks (such as the 517 and 645 classes). They were often turned out at remarkable speed. Many of the 0-6-0 saddle tanks were rebuilt as pannier tanks in the time of Churchward, at the time they were fitted with Belpaire fireboxes. George was in charge at Stafford Road for 33 years, and \\"during the period he was in control 626 engines built were classified as new and 513 as rebuilds\\" [the difference between the two often being a matter of accountancy as much as engineering], \\"a total of 1,139 and an average of about 35 per annum.\\" None of them survive today. Locomotive construction continued at Wolverhampton for a few years after George's retirement, but ceased in 1909.

He was King of the Mountains in the 1990 Tour de France.  Racing career  Claveyrolat grew up in the shadow of the Alps in the Is√®re region near Grenoble. He showed early talent as an amateur cyclist, especially in the hills. He turned professional in 1983 for the St-√âtienne-P√©lussin team and came to notice that year when he came second on the sixth stage of the Dauphin√© Lib√©r√©.Velo Club, profile of Thierry Claveyrolat It became a race in which he succeeded regularly, winning five stages and finishing highly placed. St-√âtienne was a small team and Claveyrolat's pay was so low that he worked for a construction company at Alpe d'Huez to make up the difference.Procycling, UK, October 1999 His showing in the Dauphin√© Lib√©r√© brought him a move to Syst√®me U in 1984, after which he changed sponsors frequently. It was with RMO, sponsored by an employment agency, that he won his first race as a professional: a stage of the Dauphin√© Lib√©r√© in 1987. He went on to win the Tour du Limousin in 1989, and the Tour du Haut-Var and the Coupe de France in 1993. The peak of his career was the Tour de France in 1990, when he won the stage at St-Gervais in the shadow of Mont Blanc. He finished the race in the polka dot jersey as leader of the mountains classification. He won a stage at nearby Morzine the following year. Claveyrolat was a classic, lightly built climber. His slim build and short height brought him the nickname Clavette, a play on his name meaning \\"cotter pin\\"The cranks on bicycles used to be held in place by a pin driven through their head to stop their sliding round the axle. The pins were known as cotter pins. His weakness was time-trialling, when his lightness made it hard to ride at sustained speed. There is a small memorial to him on the Chemin de la Bastille in Grenoble.Google Maps Streetview  Retirement  Claveyrolat rode for Z (a children's clothing company) and GAN (an insurance company) before retiring in May 1994. He bought a bar, the Caf√© de la Gare, at Vizille, south of Grenoble, and turned it into a bar -brasserie called L'√âtape. It had a neon polkadot sign to represent the climber's jersey he had won in the Tour. The interior was a museum of his jerseys, cups, medals and other cycling artefacts.

A man and 14 year old son died on impact. Claveyrolat was arrested and had also been drinking. Claveyrolat committed suicide by shooting himself with a rifle at 3am on 7 September 1999. He was found dead in his cellar. He left a widow, Myriam, and two children.

It is the administrative center of the Tell Abyad District within the Raqqa Governorate. Located along the Balikh River, it constitutes a divided city with the bordering city of Ak√ßakale in Turkey. Tall Abyad was captured by the Free Syrian Army in September 2012 during the Syrian Civil War, later being captured by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in January 2014. On 16 June 2015, the town was captured by the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) in the course of their Tell Abyad offensive. On 13 October 2019, as part of the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria, the Turkish Armed Forces and the Syrian National Army captured Tel Abyad and many villages in the district from the Syrian Democratic Forces. History In antiquity, Tell Abyad and the surrounding region were ruled by the Assyrian Empire and settled by Arameans. Tell Abyad could have been the site of the neo-Assyrian‚Äìera Aramean inhabited settlement of Bali·∏´u, mentioned in 814 BC. Later, various empires ruled the area, such as the Romans, Byzantines, Sassanids, Umayyads, Abbasids and finally the Ottoman Empire. Tell Abyad remained Ottoman until the end of World War I, when it was incorporated in the French mandate of Syria during the partition of the Ottoman Empire. The modern town was founded by French mandate authorities to control the border with Turkey, with first inhabitants being Armenian refugees from Anatolia, survivors of the deportations conducted during the Armenian Genocide, with around 250 Armenian families living in the city prior to the Syrian civil war. After Armenians, the Baggara Arab tribe arrived as members of the French Levant army, and decided to stay and settle in the area. Demographics Tell Abyad is the administrative center of the Tell Abyad Subdistrict and the Tell Abyad District. According to multiple sources, the majority of the inhabitants of Tell Abyad and Tell Abyad District are Arabs, with a Kurdish, Turkmen and Armenian minority. The Germany-based internet portal KurdWatch reports that Tell Abyad is mainly populated by Arabs, and estimates that in the environs of Tell Abyad, 15% of the population is Turkmen, 10% Kurdish, and the rest being Arabs. Other sources claim that Kurds make up 25%-30%. In addition, there are many Turkmen families residing in the city center. The Kurdish minority is concentrated in the west of the town and two small pockets in the countryside immediately to the east and west of town, while a small pocket of Turkman minority exists to the south of the town. The Arab residents of the town itself belong mainly to the Baggara tribe. Several Arab tribes live in the countryside surrounding the town; Naim (to the east), Annaza (to the southeast), Jays (to the southeast, south and west) and Hannada (immediate south of the town). The Jays tribe is a powerful tribe in the town with strong ties to Turkey and a former political ally of Bashar al Assad. The Democratic Union Party (PYD) formed a council of elders in Tell Abyad which has the task to administer the region and which is said to be \\"a fair representation of the ethnic composition of the town\\" and the Arab majority population. It consisted of 15 people, of which were ten Arabs, three Kurds and respectively one Armenian and one Turkmen.  Transportation  The town was connected with Istanbul and Baghdad through the Baghdad Railway.  Syrian Civil War  After the Syrian Civil War started in 2011, diverse Islamist opposition groups controlled the town, some under the flag of the Free Syrian Army. On June 30, 2014, Tell Abyad was captured by the al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), who raised their flag at the border crossing with Turkey. After ISIL defeated the Kurdish forces, the YPG and Kurdish Front, ISIL fighters announced from the minarets of the local mosques that all Kurds had to leave Tell Abyad or else be killed. Thousands of civilians, including Turkmen and Arab families, fled on 21 July. ISIL fighters systematically looted and destroyed the property of Kurds and resettled displaced Arab Sunni families from the Qalamoun area (Rif Damascus), Deir ez-Zor, and Raqqa in abandoned Kurdish homes. According to Liz Sly of the Washington Post, ISIL also collected a tax from the christians, a so called Jizya of about 100$ every six months. While ISIL controlled the border towards Turkey in Tell Abyad, it was a major source for supplies coming in from Turkey. In the June 2015 Tell Abyad Campaign, the town was besieged and in June 2015 taken over by forces of the Euphrates Volcano, the YPG and their allies within the Free Syrian Army. = During the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria = After the capture of the Tell Abyad district, Kurdish YPG fighters have been accused by Syrian rebels of deliberately displacing thousands of Arabs and Turkmens from the areas they captured from ISIL forces in northern Syria ‚Äî a charge strongly denied by the Kurds. The accusation was not backed by any evidence of ethnic or sectarian killings. The head of Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the people who had fled into Turkey were escaping fighting and there was no systematic effort to force people out. A report published by KurdWatch also accused the PYD of displacements. According to KurdWatch, repressive measures have been taken out in first line against persons with ties to the Islamic State or other political opponents. However, many of the tens of thousands of Arab residents ‚Äî namely those tribes that allegedly took part in the expulsion of the local Kurdish population in 2013 ‚Äî who fled the advancing Kurdish force have not returned, for fear of retribution from the YPG. There were reports that Kurds were forcibly removing the local Arab population, but the accusations were rejected by the United Nations. According to the Washington Post, Kurds were kurdifying the city after capturing it from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which resulted in tensions. The journal states: Kurdish forces established the Tell Abyad canton on 21 October 2015. It was included into the de facto autonomous North East Syria declared by a council including representatives of local Arab, Kurdish, Turkmen and Armenian communities. The 178-member higher council that governed Tell Abyad, elected mixed-gender co-mayors, as mandated under Rojava rules. The elected co-mayors were ethnic Arab Mansour Seloum (later elected co- chairperson for the executive committee to organize a new constitution for Rojava, and replaced by ethnic Arab Hamdan al-Abad) and ethnic Kurd Layla Mohammed. The latter was 27 years old and the first female mayor of Tell Abyad ever. On 27 February 2016, Tell Abyad came under attack from ISIL militants. YPG militias and Asayish police forces repelled the attack and eliminated all of the ISIL militants, but more than 40 security forces and around 20 civilians were left dead. A YPG spokesman claimed that ISIL militants had crossed from Turkey to attack the town. Turkey quickly denied this claim. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, there was not any infiltration from the Turkish border but dormant IS sleeper cells and others entered the town on the eve of the offensive dressed in YPG uniforms. There have been multiple other instances of ISIL terror attacks in Tell Abyad, for example on 29 June and 8 July 2016 two bombings that each claimed ten civilian lives. On 15 September 2016, the flag of the United States was raised over several public institutional buildings in Tell Abyad. The United States Department of Defense confirmed that U.S. Special Operation Forces were flying U.S. flags in the town of Tell Abyad to deter Turkish harassment shelling or attacks against Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) there. Notwithstanding, the Turkish military shelled the area on 22 September. Tell Abyad was also a hub for Combined Joint Task Force ‚Äì Operation Inherent Resolve training of new SDF recruits in the fight against ISIL in Syria. On 27 November 2018, as a part of a deconfliction initiative with Turkish forces in the area, the US set up an observation post in Tal Abyad. During their control of the city, the Kurdish YPG forces were accused of several serious human rights violations. Many thousands of the city's Arab residents were forced to leave the city and its area. Surrounding villages such as Bir Ashiq were destroyed and their residents prohibited by YPG from coming back. Many thousands of the displaced Arab residents of Tel Abyad have been protesting at the Turkish border near the city to demand the expulsion of YPG forces. Many of them have been trained in Turkey to participate in the advance on the town. In addition to the accusations of ethnic cleansing during their rule of the area, Kurdish YPG have been discouraging Arabs from staying by imposing tougher conscription policies than it does in other areas. Consequently, YPG measures have been widely rejected by the population Arab majority, especially the prominent Jais tribe. Fabrice Balanche from the Washington Institute stated in 2018: In October 2017, it was reported that Tell Abyad was to be included into the Euphrates Region, consisting of the Kobane Canton and the Tell Abyad Canton. Tell Abyad stayed a part of the canton until the Turkish offensive into north- eastern Syria. The SDF announced the creation of the Military Council of Tell Abyad in June 2019. = 2019 Turkish/SNA capture of Tel Abyad = As part of the Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria, Turkey launched airstrikes and fired artillery at SDF position inside the town. Social media images posted displayed Syrians fleeing the town. Two civilians were killed and others were wounded as part of the offensive according to The New York Times. On 13 October 2019, as part of the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria, Turkish Armed Forces and the Syrian National Army captured Tell Abyad, and many villages in the district from the SDF. On October 28, a local council was formed. Following the capture of Tell Abyad, Turkey imposed direct rule over the town and the Governor of Sanlƒ±urfa has appointed a Turkish led administration to Tell Abyad. The Governorate also stated it would provide a Syrian police trained by the Turkish authorities to the area. The UN High Commissioner on Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, reported that in Tell Abyad the forces supported by Turkey would incur in widespread human rights violations and urged Turkey to initiate an investigation of the matter.

It is a ground dweller, which evades dry periods by burrowing and hibernating - emerging to breed during floods.  Description  The back of the frog is brown or grey with darker brown or green markings, underside is white with a granular appearance. The toes are slightly webbed and a dark line extends from the leg to snout. A lighter stripe runs down the back. The call is a repeated wailing or cry. It has a shorter cry and is larger than Cyclorana cultripes.  Ecology  R. vagitus is a terrestrial frog and lacks the arboreal appendages of the similar genus Litoria. Like many Australian frogs, it can burrow and enter a state of aestivation. By hibernating it can avoid the arid conditions of the Kimberley region and emerge to take advantage of the intermittent flooding of its open grassland habitat. The range of the species is in the far north of Western Australia, overlapping the Northern Territory, in a tropical monsoon climate. It has a description based on the two known locations, which occur in open grassland, in a range of intermittent water sources. It lives from sea level to an altitude of 900 m. Based on the identified groups, population is estimated at 10 000 to 50 000. The males commence breeding by crying at floodways - this is frequently heard - with females responding by releasing up to 1000 eggs during a wet season. The tadpoles develop rapidly before evaporation of the floodwaters.  Threatened status  No threats have been identified and the species is located within a protected area. The species is given a least concern LC status by the IUCN. The species is presumed to be secure due to high populations and wide dispersal in its range. No study of any trends of these has been undertaken.  Further reading  * Tyler, M.J., Smith, L.A. and Johnstone, R.E 2000. Frogs of Western Australia. 3rd edition. Western Australian Museum, Perth.

Some of the distinguishing features are listed, such as lineage, general form of stances, the balance of hard and soft techniques, and the number and names of kata forms. Background The four earliest karate styles developed in Japan are Shotokan, Wado-ryu, Shito-ryu, and Goju-ryu; most styles of Karate are derived from these four.Corcoran, John and Farkas, Emil. Martial Arts. Traditions, History, People. Gallery Books, 1983, p. 49. The first three of these styles find their origins in the Shorin-Ryu style from Shuri, Okinawa, while Goju-ryu finds its origins in Naha. Shuri karate is rather different from Naha karate, drawing on different predecessor influences. Shito-ryu can be regarded as a blend of Shuri and Naha traditions as its kata incorporate both Shuri and Naha kata.Clayton, Bruce D. Shotokan's Secret, The Hidden Truth Behind Karate's Fighting Origins. Black Belt Communications LLC, 2004, p. 97 & 153. When it comes to individual karate styles; Shotokan involves long, deep stances and powerful long range techniques. Shito-ryu, on the other hand, uses more upright stances and stresses speed rather than power in its long and middle range techniques. Wado-ryu too employs shorter, more natural stances and the style is characterised by the emphasis on body shifting to avoid attacks. Kyokushin, an extremely hard style, involves breaking more often than the other styles and full contact, knockdown sparring as a main part of its training.Kara-te Magazine. Special Collector's Edition - Kara-te, History, Masters, Traditions, Philosophy. Blitz Publications, p. 27, 45, 39 & 67. Goju- ryu places emphasis on Sanchin kata and its rooted Sanchin stance, and it features grappling and close-range techniques.

Traditionally produced Applejohn Blue Label Blend, Applejohn Granny Smith Applejack is a strong alcoholic drink produced from apples. Popular in the American colonial era, the drink's prevalence declined in the 19th and 20th centuries amid competition from other spirits.Michael Foley, Drinking with the Saints: The Sinner's Guide to a Holy Happy Hour (2015, ): Perhaps the most interesting option is applejack, the first distilled liquor native to North America and a great favorite among the colonists. [Now] usually a blend of apple brandy and neutral spirits that retains the flavor of the apples[.] Applejack is used in several cocktails, including the Jack Rose.  History  Apple brandy was first produced in colonial New Jersey in 1698 by William Laird, a Scottish immigrant who settled in Monmouth County.Karen Tina Harrison, Jersey Lightning, New Jersey Monthly, July 13, 2009. The drink was once known as Jersey Lightning. Laird's great-grandson, Robert Laird, who served in the Continental Army, incorporated Laird's Distillery in 1780, after previously operating a tavern. The oldest licensed applejack distillery in the United States, Laird & Company of Scobeyville, New Jersey, was until the 2000s the country's only remaining producer of applejack, and continues to dominate applejack production.Joseph D'Agnese, In Search Of ...; Not Your Toddler's Apple Cider, New York Times (June 11, 2000). Once popular in early America, applejack declined in popularity due to the rise of other spirits that were easier to manufacture on a commercial basis, including rum, bourbon, and whiskey in the 19th century and gin, vodka, and tequila in the 20th century. In 1920, with the beginning of the Prohibition era, Laird's ended the production of liquor and began producing apple juice. In 1931, John Evans Laird received permission to produce apple brandy for \\"medicinal purposes\\" and stockpiled its product until the repeal of Prohibition in 1933.Ralph Ginzburg, Harvest Is In at Centuries-Old Distillery, New York Times (October 26, 1986). Applejack has been associated with four presidents of the United States: George Washington requested instructions for producing applejack from Robert Laird for the family's recipe for applejack; Abraham Lincoln served it during a brief stint as a tavern keeper in Springfield, Illinois; Franklin D. Roosevelt included applejack in the Manhattans he regularly consumed; and Lyndon B. Johnson gave a case of applejack to Soviet leader Alexei Kosygin in the 1967 Glassboro Summit Conference. In the 2010s, a number of smaller craft distilleries began to produce applejack in places such as Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley,Kurt Bresswein, How it's made: Apples to applejack in the Lehigh Valley, lehighvalleylive.com (November 2016). New York's Hudson Valley,Kara Newman, Are People Taking Applejack Seriously Now? Johnny Appleseed goes craft, Bloomberg News (February 4, 2016). and Holland, Michigan.Garret Ellison, Applejack is back: Coppercraft Distillery goes to market with historic American spirit, MLive.com (September 30, 2014). Production The name applejack derives from the traditional method of producing the drink, jacking, the process of freezing fermented cider and then removing the ice, increasing the alcohol content. Cider produced after the fall harvest was left outside during the winter. Periodically the frozen chunks of ice which had formed were removed, thus concentrating the unfrozen alcohol in the remaining liquid. An alternative method involved placing a cask of hard cider in snow, allowing ice to form on the inside of the cask as the contents began to freeze, and then tapping the cask and pouring off the still-liquid portion of the contents. Starting with the fermented juice, with an alcohol content of less than ten percent, the concentrated result can contain 25‚Äì40% alcohol. Because freeze distillation is a low-infrastructure method of production compared to evaporative distillation, and does not require the burning of firewood to create heat, hard cider and applejack were historically easy to produce, though more expensive than grain alcohol.Lew Nichols, Annie Proulx, Cider: Making, Using & Enjoying Sweet & Hard Cider, 3rd Edition (2015, ) The disadvantage of freeze distillation, also called fractional crystallization, is that the substances remaining after the removal of the water include not only ethanol, but also harmful methanol, esters, aldehydes, and fusel alcohols.Matthew B. Rowley, Moonshine! (Lark Books, 2007), p. 141. Reducing methanol with the absorption of a molecular sieve is a practical method for production. When commercial production began, applejack was also starting to be produced through evaporative distillation.Scott C. Martin, The SAGE Encyclopedia of Alcohol (2015, ): The evaporative technique was used when commercial applejack production began. Modern commercially produced applejack is often no longer produced by jacking but rather by blending apple brandy and neutral grain spirits.Sanborn Conner Brown, Wines & Beers of Old New England: A How-to-do-it History (1978, ) Comparison to calvados Applejack is somewhat similar to Calvados, an apple brandy from Normandy, France, to which it is often compared.Eric Asimov, An Apple Orchard in a Glass, New York Times (December 8, 2004). However, Calvados is made from cider apples, while applejack is made from apples such as Winesap.

This practice of inspections led to the coining of the English idiom , meaning being sufficient. When a unit is created, it is \\"mustered in\\" and when it is disbanded, it is \\"mustered out\\". A muster roll is the list of members of a military unit, often including their rank and the dates they joined or left. A roll call is the reading aloud of the names on the muster roll and the responses, to determine who is present. Musters (in the sense of gatherings with roll calls) also take place in prisons.For example: United Kingdom In Tudor England, musters were periodic assessments of the availability of local militia to act as a defence force.Jeremy Gibson and Alan Dell, Tudor and Stuart Muster Rolls (Federation of Family History Societies, 1989) To some extent, the system was an outdated remnant of the feudal system where local lords had their own armies, which they provided for the King as required.

On the morning of 6 January 1993, a group of 7‚Äì8 armed JKLF militants attacked a platoon of Border Security Force soldiers at Baba Yousuf Lane near Sopore and killed at least one soldier. Response The Indian government claimed that the high casualties were the result of an intense gun battle between the BSF soldiers and terrorists in which an explosives cache belonging to the militants exploded and spread the fire to nearby buildings. However, the government later initiated a judicial inquiry into the matter and suspended several BSF officers due to the publicity the incident had generated. The day after the massacre, thousands of Kashmiris, defying a government-imposed curfew, protested against the actions of the BSF soldiers on the streets of Sopore. The then Prime Minister Narasimha Rao ordered State Governor Girish Saxena to visit Sopore and announced a compensation of for the relatives of the deceased. However, Muslim leaders, left-wing politicians and human rights organizations criticised Saxena for failing to stop human rights violations by the security forces in Kashmir and demanded a parliamentary delegation be sent to assess the destruction.

The aim is to train the most important wartime units at intervals of about 5 years. The average duration of the exercises is approximately 5 days and nights. Many never get called to refresher training, some get called frequently and some even apply for voluntary additional training. The obligation for refresher training ends at the age of 60 for Officers and NCOs and at 50 for the lower ranks.

In English, it is usually called \\"roasted soy flour\\". More precisely it is \\"roasted whole soy flour\\".Shurtleff, William; Aoyagi, Akiko. 1975. The Book of Tofu: Food for Mankind.

Lafayette, California: Soyinfo Center. 709 pp. (1,420 references; 76 photos and illustrations. Free online) Usage of the word kinako appeared in cookbooks from the late Muromachi period (1336‚Äì1573). Kinako means \\"yellow flour\\" in Japanese. Production Kinako is produced by finely grinding roasted soybeans into powder. The skin of the soybean is typically removed before pulverizing the beans, but some varieties of kinako retain the roasted skin. Yellow soybeans produce a yellow kinako, and green soybeans produce a light-green product. Kinako, being composed of soybeans, is a healthy topping and flavouring which contains B vitamins and protein. Compared to boiled soybeans, however, the protein in kinako is not easily digested. Usage Japanese dango sweets covered in kinako soybean flour Kinako is widely used in Japanese cooking, but is strongly associated with dango and wagashi. Dango, dumplings made from mochiko (rice flour), are commonly coated with kinako. Wagashi, traditional Japanese confections, also make extensive use of a mixture of kinako and sugar. Examples include ohagi and Abekawa-mochi. Kinako, when combined with milk or soy milk, can also be made into a drink. One example of its use in popular foods is warabimochi, which is a famous kinako- covered sweet.

This abnormal activity can originate from one or more cranial lobes, often travels from one lobe to another, and interferes with normal activity from the affected lobe.

This phenomenon has been confirmed through telemetry by electrocorticography in which electrode grids are positioned sub-durally and augmented by intra- cranial depth electrodes.

He won nine special prizes and seven gold stars for defeating yokozuna. He retired in 1992 and became the head coach of Izutsu stable in 1994, succeeding his father. He oversaw Kakury≈´'s promotion to the yokozuna rank in 2014 but also saw the size of his stable decline. He was a deputy director of the Japan Sumo Association and a judge of tournament bouts. He died of pancreatic cancer in 2019. He was the elder brother of fellow top division sumo wrestler Terao Tsunefumi. Career Sakahoko made his professional debut in January 1978, dropping out of high school to join Izutsu stable, which was run by his father, ex sekiwake Tsurugamine. His elder brother, , had joined sumo in March 1975, but Sakahoko quickly caught up with him and they made their j≈´ry≈ç debuts together in July 1981. Sakahoko made his debut in the top makuuchi division in November 1982. (His elder brother, meanwhile, never got higher than j≈´ry≈ç 2 and slid down the rankings). In January 1984 he earned his first kinboshi or gold star for a yokozuna upset when he defeated Takanosato. He celebrated the win making a guts pose on the dohy≈ç, which had not been seen previously from a Japanese wrestler (although Hawaiian Takamiyama had been known to do it). He reached what was to be his highest rank of sekiwake for the first time in July 1984. This was his first ever tournament in the titled san'yaku ranks (jumping over the komusubi rank) and somewhat unusually for a san'yaku debutant he was able to produce a winning score (kachi-koshi) of 8‚Äì7. He received the Technique prize for his efforts. In September 1984, the first tournament since new rules for touching down with both fists at the tachi-ai were enforced, he was told to redo his match in which he had seemingly beaten Hokutenyu, and glared at the chief judge, the former Kitanofuji. In March 1985 Sakahoko's younger brother Terao joined him in makuuchi. They were the first pair of brothers to be in the top division simultaneously since Tanikaze and Tatsugesake 200 years before. In September 1987 he defeated two yokozuna, Chiyonofuji and Futahaguro, and was awarded the Outstanding Performance prize. He was promoted back to sekiwake and proceeded to hold the rank for a then record nine successive tournaments from November 1987 until March 1989, but he was never under consideration for promotion to ≈çzeki as he could not achieve regular double figure scores, his best result being 9‚Äì6. In July 1989, troubled by a shoulder injury, he turned in a 2‚Äì13 record and was demoted to the maegashira ranks.

In May 2016 while on duty as a judge he suffered a broken thigh when Hakuh≈ç gave Yoshikaze an extra shove after the bout was over, causing the wrestler to fall on top of him. Fighting style Unlike his brother Terao, who liked pushing and thrusting techniques, Sakahoko took after his father in specialising in yotsu-sumo or grappling techniques. He was well known for favouring the grip on the mawashi with both arms inside the opponent's, called moro-zashi. His most common winning kimarite was overwhelmingly yori-kiri or force out, which accounted for over half his victories at sekitori level. Personal life He chose the occasion of taking over as Izutsu Oyakata in 1994 to publicly reveal for the first time that he was married with a seven-year-old daughter. His daughter is now a member of the Takarazuka Revue. Sakahoko died in Kobe of pancreatic cancer on 16 September 2019. A wake was held on 24 September with the funeral the following day, both at Izutsu stable. His former wrestlers were being looked after by Kagamiyama Oyakata while the Japan Sumo Association decided which stable they will be transferred to. As of 1 October 2019, all personnel belong to Michinoku stable. In March 2020, his elder brother Kakureizan died, leaving Terao as the only surviving Fukuzono brother.

Formed in France in late 1941, the division spent its entire combat history on the Eastern Front. History The 23rd Panzer Division was established on the 21st of September 1941 in France. It was built around the 101st Panzer Brigade and two infantry regiments and initially equipped with \\"booty tanks\\" which were soon after exchanged for German tanks.Mitcham, p. 168 In March 1942, the division went to the Eastern Front near Kharkov as a subdivision of the German Sixth Army. It was to remain within the Army Group South for the major part of its service.23\\\\. Panzer-Division, balsi.de (in German) The division took part in the German advance to the Caucasus, but was subsequently sent north to Stalingrad. It escaped encirclement when the 6th Army was trapped there, and took part in the subsequent failed relief attempt. At the end of its first year on the Eastern Front the 23rd Panzer Division had lost 90 percent of its tanks.Mitcham, p. 169 The 23rd Panzer Division was part of the German defence and retreat in the southern Ukraine, frequently being moved between crisis points.

DirectX plugins allow the replacement of traditional recording studio hardware and rack units used in professional studios with software-based counterparts that can be connected together in a modular way. This allows host manufacturers to focus on the conviviality and efficiency of their products while specialized manufacturers can focus on the digital signal processing aspect. For example, there are plugins for effects boxes, such as reverbs and delays, effects pedals, like guitar distortion, flange and chorus, and for mixing and mastering processors such as compressors, limiters, exciters, sub bass enhancers, stereo imagers and many more.  Overview  Similar to Virtual Studio Technology and later, Audio Units in Apple Mac OS X, DirectX plugins have an open standard architecture for connecting audio synthesizers and effect plugins to audio editors and hard-disk recording systems. DirectX plug-ins are based on Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM) which allows plugins to be recognised and used by other applications via common interfaces. Plugins connect to applications and other plugins with pins via which they can pass and processes buffered streams of audio (or video) data. Architecturally, DirectX plugins are DirectShow filters.  Types and compatibility  DirectX plugins are also of two types, DirectX effect plugins (DX) and DirectX Instrument plugins (DXi). Effect plugins are used to generate, process, receive, or otherwise manipulate streams of audio. Instrument plugins are MIDI controllable DirectX plugins, generally used to synthesize sound or playback sampled audio using virtual synthesizers, samplers or drum machines. DirectX effect plugins were developed by Microsoft as part of DirectShow. DirectX instruments were developed by Cakewalk in co- operation with Microsoft and are available on Windows. Several wrapper plugins are available so that DirectX plugins can be used in applications which only support VST and vice versa. Others such as chainer plugins are also available which allow chaining multiple plugins together.  Programmability  DirectX plugins can be developed in C++ using Microsoft's DirectX SDK, Sony's Audio Plug-In Development Kit or Cakewalk's DirectX Wizard. There is also a Delphi SDK available.Delphi SDK  DirectX plugin hosts  * ACID Pro (version 3.0 or later) * Adobe Audition (Formerly Cool Edit 2000 and Cool Edit Pro 1.0, 2.0) * Cakewalk Sonar (version 2.0 or later) * MAGIX Samplitude * REAPER * Sony VegasSony's Audio Plug-In Development Kit * Sound Forge * Steinberg Wavelab * Steinberg Nuendo * Steinberg Cubase * OpenMPT  Future  DirectX plugins are superseded by DMO-based signal processing filters and more recently, by Media Foundation Transforms.

He is probably best known for the 1956 short animated film The Conceited General. From about 1960 he worked in an ink-wash animation style that was influenced by the painter Qi Baishi. Not permitted to carry on his animation during the Cultural Revolution, Te Wei regained a position of artistic influence in the late 1970s and the 1980s with a series of animated films in painterly style.  Biography  The Borderlands by Te Wei, published in Modern Sketch, 1930s Te Wei was born as Sheng Song () to a poor family in Shanghai. As a teenager, he started drawing political cartoons, and would later make a living drawing anti‚ÄëJapanese propaganda. After Mao Zedong's seizing power in 1949, an executive in charge of the Changchun Film Studio would remember Te Wei's cartoons, and approached him to lead the studio's animation department, despite his total lack of experience in animation. The Japanese animator Tadahito Mochinaga served as his mentor, and the two became lifelong friends. Within a year, the studio was relocated to Shanghai, where they enjoyed a brief period of artistic freedom with governmental funding during the Hundred Flowers Campaign. Initially, much was learned by studying Soviet animation, but the studio soon started experimenting with techniques based on domestic traditions. The Conceited General (1956) shows influences from both Chinese culture, with character designs and music inspired by the Peking opera, and Soviet animators such as Ivan Ivanov-Vano, as well as western ones such as Walt Disney. During a visit to the studio, then Vice Premier Chen Yi suggested that they make an animated version of the paintings of Qi Baishi. A group of animators led by Te Wei thus set out to create Where is Mama. The film was the first to make use of ink-wash animation, and would go on to win several awards, both in China and internationally. It was followed by The Cowboy's Flute (1963) in the same technique. In 1964, as Mao was gearing up for the Cultural Revolution, the studio was shut down, and Te Wei was placed in solitary confinement for a year. To keep his spirits up, he would sketch on the glass pane of a table that stood in his small room, erasing the drawings when he heard a guard approaching. Te Wei spent the following years in exile in the countryside, and was not able to return to the studio until 1975. The constraints of the Cultural Revolution were starting to loosen, and Mao's death in 1976 was followed by a new period of artistic vigour. The 1980s would be an intense period for Te Wei, who found himself in charge of some 500 workers at the studio. Still benefitting from state funding, the studio produced some of its most acclaimed and experimental work. Having stepped down as studio president in 1984, Te Wei directed the feature film Monkey King Conquers the Demon (1984), based on Journey to the West, and the acclaimed Feeling from Mountain and Water (1988), that would turn out to be his last film. In 1989, the communist party honored Te Wei by naming him one of the four outstanding filmmakers in China's history.

Life At his father Henry's death 1078 he became count of Louvain. He was allied by family marriages to most of the nearby lords: he was brother-in-law of Baldwin II of Hainaut, and son-in-law of Robert I of Flanders. The bishop of Li√®ge, Henri I of Verdun, was peace-loving. Henry was able to concentrate on the internal affairs of his lands, without external threats. He supported religious foundations in the western parts, and legislated to reduce lawlessness. After the death on 20 September 1085 of Hermann II, count palatine of Lotharingia, he became landgrave of Brabant, which was an imperial fief between the Dender and the Zenne. In July 1095, he took part in a tournament in Tournai. Fighting in a joust against Gosuin de Forest, he was mortally wounded. Family About 1090 he married Gertrude of Flanders (1080‚Äì1117), daughter of Robert I of Flanders and Gertrude of Saxony. A genealogy of the time attributes to him four daughters (not named). Since he was succeeded by his brother Godfrey I of Leuven, it is inferred that he did not leave a son as heir. It has been suggested that the daughters included: * Adelaide, wife of duke Simon I of Lorraine * Gertrude, wife to Lambert, count of Montaigu and Clermont. Gertrude of Flanders, widowed, married in 1096 duke Theodoric II of Lorraine (died 1115) and was mother of Thierry of Alsace (\\"Theodoric\\").

The investigation found that an axle had broken on the goods train, and the excursion train collided with the debris on the track. Investigation The crash was examined by Captain Henry Tyler of the Railway Inspectorate, and he was able to pinpoint the disaster in a broken axle on one of the goods wagons of the first train. The engine driver stopped his train when he discovered that several rear wagons had suddenly derailed, one of which blocked the adjacent line. He then saw the second train approaching at speed on the next line, and tried to warn him, but to no avail. The passenger train collided with the wagon across the line, the fatalities occurring in several of the lead carriages. The broken axle was examined by Tyler, and he found that it had cracked from the edge into the centre in a progressive way. The age and history of the axle were unknown, despite Tyler's own attempts to encourage railway companies to keep records of axles and their mileage. Axle Fractures The sudden failure of vehicle axles bedevilled the railways from their very beginning, a notorious example being the terrible Versailles train crash of 1842, when almost 100 passengers were killed. They continued to fail for many years on all railways, causing yet more disastrous accidents. Another derailment had occurred the previous year of 1869, for example, in the Dalton Junction rail crash. Fatigue was the basic cause of the problem, but the hairline cracks characteristic of fatigue are very difficult to detect, and were frequently missed, until they became critical. Some of the first systematic studies of the problem were undertaken by William John Macquorn Rankine, and later by August W√∂hler, who showed how fatigue cracks are started (as surface defects) and grow with each loading.

Background When Koufax began recording their third album, this happened without a valid record deal. As a result, the band had to pre- finance the recording costs from their own pockets. They worked in six different studios. The band was also currently undergoing a line-up change. From the now disbanding but friendly band The Get Up Kids, brothers Rob and Ryan Pope joined the band to form the drums and bass section. No Koufax album features as many guest musicians as this one. For example, the album was recorded with three different drummers. Guitar and piano work was also added from outside. For the first time on a Koufax album a pedal steel guitar can be heard. Finally, the finished album was handed over to Doghouse (distribution in the USA) and to Motormusic (distribution in Europe). Track listing Reception The album received mainly positive reviews: \\"Hard Times are in Fashion ratcheted up the energy a bit, while also expanding their sonic palate with some pedal-steel. [...The record] deserves to be heard by more ears, so seek it out if you like your pop music smart, clever and infectious.\\" \\\\- Waxing Nostalgic \\"While Jared Rosenberg's piano is omnipresent, it isn't abused in Ben Folds Five fashion or used as an overly sappy device √† la Keane or Coldplay. Instead, it's merely another instrument, sometimes battling Suchan and Ben Force's guitars point for point, other times blending deftly into the background. The album is infused with subtle political and social commentary, relating mostly to the war in Iraq, the Bush presidency, and foreigners' apparent increasing disgust with The American Way. But Koufax don't pound a listener over the head with their politics.\\" \\\\- Allmusic \\"They, too, don't wanna be to be American idiots. It may not be fair to call Hard Times Are in Fashion a political album.

They covered a variety of topics including hobbies, art, history and wildlife. The aim of these books was to interest the observer and they have also been popular amongst children. Some of them have become collector's items. For the dedicated collector this could be a lifetime's work as there are over 800 variations, some of which are now rare. The values of the books can vary from 50 pence to hundreds of pounds. The books were produced with paper dust covers up until 1969. Each one had a unique pattern of squiggly lines at the top but these were not especially practical because they were easy to rip and stain. From 1970, the covers were protected with a glossy coating. These types are often referred to as \\"Glossies\\". From the late 1970s, Warne decided to laminate the covers to the actual books to make them sturdier and more resistant to wear. The first Observer's guide was published in 1937, and was on the subject of British birds. This is now rare, and a mint copy with a dust cover is worth hundreds of pounds. The same year, Warne published a second Observer's book on British wild flowers. A mint copy of this book is worth around ¬£220. When the popularity of these was recognized, several more titles were added 'uniform in the series', but during World War II production was limited due to paper and labour shortages. Even so, by 1941 Warne had published the first six Observer's books. In 1942 a special edition book was brought out on \\"airplanes\\" . This book had no number in the series, as it was brought out to help people spot enemy warplanes. It was reprinted in 1943 and 1945. The first few Observer's titles had focused on nature, but gradually subjects like geology, music and architecture were introduced. 'Spotter' titles like Aircraft, Automobiles and Railway Locomotives proved popular. During the 1950s and 60s collecting sets of these books was popular among children and adults alike. When Warne was acquired by Penguin books in 1983, Warne brought out new editions of the Observer's books. These were slightly bigger than the original books, and were in paperback, not hardback. The same year Penguin, with permission of Warne, started printing their own, more up-to-date Observer's books. These again were slightly larger than the originals, but were hardbacks. Like the later original Observer's books, the dust covers were laminated to the actual book. There were two types of the Penguin Observer's books: Bloomsbury Observer's, and Claremont Observer's, (of which there were only 12 different editions). After a hiatus of 17 years, Peregrine Books published the appropriately titled Observer's Book of Observer's Books in 1999, in a format that matched the original editions and was numbered 99 so as to follow on from the last 'official' title. As the title implies, it is a guide to the series with details of its history, authors, and print-runs. As a sign of the series' popularity, this potentially obscure book has been reprinted no fewer than six times. More recently the series has been rounded up to 100 with the publication of Wayside and Woodland in 2003.

Background and early career Cunneen was born at St. Margaret's Hospital in Darlinghurst, the daughter of John and Catherine Cunneen. Her father was a civil engineer who became chief of the NSW Water Resources Commission. Cunneen grew up in the south western suburbs of Sydney, was educated at Santa Sabina College, Strathfield. She joined the Attorney General's Department in 1977, working in the Ministerial office. She was an Industrial Officer at the Public Service Board of NSW from 1981 to 1986, when she transferred to what is now the New South Wales Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions where her immediate manager was Megan Latham. After commencing study part-time in 1977, she graduated with a Bachelor of Laws from the NSW Institute of Technology in 1982 and a Master of Laws from the University of Sydney in 1989. In 1982, she was admitted a legal practitioner of the New South Wales Supreme Court. In 2014 she was awarded the Law Alumni Award by the University of Technology. Crown Prosecutor Cunneen is a Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor in the NSW Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and has held a commission as a Crown Prosecutor since 1990. She came to prominence when she prosecuted a series of highly publicised pedophiles and several notable gang rape and murder trials. In October 2007 Cunneen was appointed as Senior Counsel and her peers at the Bar elected her as one of 21 members of the Bar Council of New South Wales. She is a Bar Councillor, having received the second highest number of votes in the 2014 Bar Council elections. Between 1995 and 2009 Cunneen was a lecturer in child abuse and neglect, focusing on the court system, at the Faculty of Social Work at the University of New South Wales. In April 2007 The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Cunneen had been removed as prosecutor in the trial of an alleged gang rapist after the court found there would be a perception of unfairness if she acted in the case. Cunneen had referred to the case, although without naming it and speaking only in reference to the deleterious effects on the victim arising from the sevenyear delay in concluding it, during the Sir Ninian Stephen Lecture in 2005 at Newcastle University. Cunneen's lecture was described by Justice David Levine as \\"the most articulate commentary on the criminal justice system, in my opinion\\". The decision to remove her was criticised by the New South Wales Bar Association, however it was not appealed by the Director of Public Prosecutions. John Marsden wrote to the Legal Services Commissioner, calling Cunneen \\"a disgrace to our profession\\". His complaint was dismissed. In 2010, Cunneen as a private citizen, gave character evidence for Brett Stewart, referring to his having campaigned in New Guinea against violence towards women, in Sydney's District Court in his trial after an allegation of sexual assault. Stewart was found not guilty by the jury in under an hour's deliberation. ICAC investigation Following a serious car accident involving the girlfriend of one of her sons, it was alleged by an anonymous complainant that Cunneen, her son (Stephen Wyllie), and his injured girlfriend (Sophia Tilley) attempted to influence the outcome of police inquiries into the accident by attempting to pervert the course of justice. Cunneen rejected the claims against her. Cunneen was accused of advising Sophia Tilley to fake chest pains to avoid a breath test after the car accident. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) announced on 29 October 2014 that it would begin investigations into her alleged actions. Independent witnesses at the scene vouched that Tilley was being treated in the ambulance before the police, and later Cunneen, arrived. Tilley, who was not the at fault driver, was blood-tested at hospital and recorded 0.00. Cunneen submitted that the failure of ICAC to clearly illustrate the reasons for their decision to investigate Cunneen's alleged conduct was to commission an investigation whereby acting beyond their powers.. Cunneen successfully appealed to the New South Wales Court of Appeal,. and ICAC was granted leave for the matter to be heard before the High Court of Australia. On 15 April 2015 the High Court found that ICAC had exceeded its authority based on its misinterpretation of \\"corrupt conduct\\" in the ICAC Act. The Court ruled that Cunneen's alleged conduct, had it occurred, might have affected an official's choice of action, but would not have affected the official's probity in making that choice. The High Court also held that the alleged conduct could not have amounted to corruption., The Court accepted that the alleged conduct of Cunneen, had it occurred, would have been in a private and not an official capacity, and also found that the alleged conduct could not have amounted to corruption. ICAC was ordered to pay costs. On 27 May 2015, ICAC referred the allegations against Cunneen, Wyllie and Tilley to the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions. The DPP referred the matter to the Attorney General, who referred it to the Solicitor General. The Solicitor General, after obtaining advice from senior counsel in another state in view of Cunneen's prominence in the NSW legal profession, determined that there was no evidence whatever warranting the prosecution of any of them for any offence. Following this decision, Cunneen criticised ICAC's powers as \\"extraordinarily draconian\\". =Notable cases= Notable cases successfully prosecuted by Cunneen include: *Robert 'Dolly' Dunn *Diane Fingletonthe Chief Magistrate of Queensland, convicted of the offence of intimidation of a witness; subsequently overturned on appeal by the High Court of Australia; *Colin Fisk and Phillip Bellconvicted for pedophilia; *Jeffrey Gilham; *Michael Guider; *Michael Kanaanfor the shooting of a police officer;. *The four Khan Brothers, commonly called The K brothers *William Mathesonthe murderer of Disney cartoonist Lyndsay van Blanken *Paul Petersthe man who put a fake collar bomb around the neck of Sydney teenager Madeleine Pulver *Graeme Reevesthe so-called Butcher of Bega *Bilal Skaf *Quoc Vinh Toconvicted of rape *Newcastle triple murderer Anthony Richard DentMurderer Anthony Dent told friend in text of addiction to killing park alcoholics In 2004 it was reported that Cunneen's advice to Nicholas Cowdery, the NSW Director of Public Prosecutions, concerning sexual abuse allegations against an Australian swimming coach, Scott Volkers, was leaked. It was reported that Cunneen's advice stated that \\"the inevitable conclusion from the brief as a whole is that Scott Volkers was a thoroughly disreputable man, given to inappropriate touching and comments towards young swimmers in his charge.\\" But it warned that the situation was \\"complicated by the fondness of many for him.\\" Her final assessment of the matter was that \\"prosecution of these old matters being so relatively minor would erode public confidence in the course of the criminal justice system.\\" In July 2014 Cunneen made a statement to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. Commissioner On 9 November 2012 Cunneen was appointed Commissioner of the NSW Special Commission of Inquiry into matters relating to the police investigation of certain child sexual abuse allegations in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Maitland-Newcastle. Commissioner Cunneen reported to the NSW Governor Marie Bashir on 30 May 2014. Commonwealth Integrity Commission On 18 December 2018 Cunneen was appointed to the panel of experts who will advise Government on the development of the legislation for the Commonwealth Integrity Commission. Personal life Cunneen lives in Sydney's North Shore. She has three sons, born in 1988, 1990 and 1992. She is married to Grandmaster Gregory Wyllie, 9th Dan, who runs a very successful taekwondo school, Wyllie Martial Arts. The fictional character Janet King, in the ABC TV drama series of the same name, is believed to be loosely based on Cunneen.

The lead ship in her class, she was named for Aristaeus (in Greek mythology, the son of Apollo and the huntress Cyrene), the only US Naval vessel to bear the name. Construction The ship was laid down as LST-329 on 12 November 1942, at the Philadelphia Navy Yard; reclassified ARB-1 on 25 January 1943; launched on 1 February 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Arthur Taylor; converted at Fairfield, Maryland, by the Maryland Drydock Company for service as a battle damage repair ship; and commissioned on 18 May 1943, with Lieutenant Ralph M. G. Swany, Jr., in command. Service history On 1 June, the ship got underway for Norfolk, Virginia. During the next six weeks, she conducted shakedown training out of Norfolk and in the Chesapeake Bay. On 23 July, she left the east coast and shaped a course for the Pacific. The vessel transited the Panama Canal and joined the Pacific Fleet on 1 August. She then continued on via Bora Bora, the Society Islands, and Tutuila, American Samoa to Noum√©a, New Caledonia. Aristaeus reached Noum√©a on 14 September, and operated in its immediate vicinity through the remainder of 1943, and the first six months of 1944. Early in July 1944, she anchored at Sydney, Australia. After upkeep at that port, the repair ship journeyed to New Guinea, in late September, and provided battle damage repairs to vessels in this area into April 1945. On 1 May, she anchored at Kerama Retto in the Ryukyu Islands. The vessel remained at Kerama Retto during the next two months. As a member of Service Squadron (ServRon) 10, she performed battle damage and voyage repairs to various ships of the fleet. On 2 July, the ship moved her base of operations to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, where she provided routine repair services. On 13 August, she was ordered to assist in repairing the torpedoed battleship . Many of Pennsylvanias compartments were flooded, and she had settled heavily by the stern. Aristaeus repair efforts, however, enabled the man-of-war to get underway for Pearl Harbor on 24 August, nine days after the Japanese capitulation ended hostilities. Post-war service Aristaeus remained at Buckner Bay until early December. She left Okinawa on 3 December, and shaped a course for the west coast of the United States. The ship reached San Francisco, California, on 27 December, and entered a period of upkeep and repairs. She remained at San Francisco until 22 May 1946, when she got underway for San Diego. Upon her arrival there, the vessel reported to the San Diego Group, 19th Fleet, for inactivation. Aristaeus was decommissioned on 15 January 1947, and was placed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1961. The vessel was sold to Brown Industries, Inc. of Oakland, California on 14 March 1962, and was subsequently scrapped.

History Œ±-Methylfentanyl was initially discovered by a team at Janssen Pharmaceutica in the 1960s.US Patent 3164600 In 1976, it began to appear mixed with \\"china white\\" heroin as an additive. It was first identified in the bodies of two drug overdose victims in Orange County, California, in December 1979, who appeared to have died from opiate overdose but tested negative for any known drugs of this type. Over the next year, there were 13 more deaths, and eventually the responsible agent was identified as Œ±-methylfentanyl. A bag of \\"China White\\" Œ±-methylfentanyl. Œ±-Methylfentanyl was placed on the Schedule I list in September 1981, only two years after its appearance on the street, but already other analogs were being developed. Following the appearance of Œ±-methylfentanyl on the market, over ten new analogs of fentanyl have been reported, starting with para-fluorofentanyl, followed by Œ±-methylacetylfentanyl, then by the highly potent 3-methylfentanyl, and subsequently by many others such as Œ≤-hydroxyfentanyl, ohmefentanyl, Œ≤-hydroxythiofentanyl and Œ≤-hydroxy-4-methylfentanyl. The development of such a wide structural family of novel narcotic drugs was a major factor responsible for the implementation of the Federal Analog Act which for the first time attempted to control entire families of drugs based on their structural similarity rather than scheduling new drug analogs individually as each appeared. In 1991, a group of Russian chemistry students discovered a simplified synthesis route which used phosgene instead of phenethylamine. Soon, abuse of the drug became widespread, causing a tenth of overdoses in the Moscow region. Œ±-Methylfentanyl became notorious for low safety, and production declined. Effects Œ±-Methylfentanyl has similar effects to fentanyl. It is less potent by weight due to reduced binding affinity to its target site, yet longer acting as the Œ±-methyl group interferes with binding to metabolic enzymes which break the drug down. The independent discovery of the effect of the Œ±-methyl group on fentanyl also marked the first time clandestine recreational-drug research had an effect on practical scientific research.Ohmefentanyl Since fentanyl itself is highly potent and notorious for causing fatal overdoses when abused, and also very short lasting with recreational users often administering doses every hour, Œ±-methylfentanyl could have several advantages over the parent compound as a recreational drug. Side effects of fentanyl analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression (namely with overdoses or improper drug-combinations, such as with benzodiazepines) which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs such as Œ±-methylfentanyl and 3-methylfentanyl are often used as the \\"cut\\" in small amounts in normal heroin stamps and bags, making them more potent and profitable than when sold as heroin alone due to the advantage of raising the retail price and potency per unit sold.

Originally, sections of Hunter Street were called William Street after King William IV and Peel Street after the British PM, Sir Robert Peel. Central Public School building on Hunter Street West was built in 1853. This school was built to accommodate 1,000 students, was the largest graded school in Upper Canada, and became the only public school in Hamilton, at the time of its opening in 1853. The building's original final proportioned classical design, by the firm Cumberland & Ridout, was extensively remodelled in 1890 by the Hamilton architect, James Balfour. His alterations, including a steeply pitched roof, certain round arched windows and a heightened central tower, created an edifice in conformity with the late Victorian tastes.

The group originally consisted of members from Wildstyle and \\"Floor Master Crew\\" History The New York City Breakers were a breaking crew from the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx originally known as the Floor Masters. Michael Holman, an up-and-coming filmmaker who promoted hip-hop parties at a night club called Negril, became tired of watching the same breaking crew dance and wanted to host a breaking battle. The Floor Master Crew accepted an invitation in 1982 offering to battle a rival crew at Negril. They combined footwork, style and power. Floor Master Crew went on in 1982 to battle more rivals crews on That's Incredible. Holman saw the crew's athleticism and soon after signed on to be their manager with the help of the legendary B-boy Lil Lep from the 7 Deadly Sins Crew, on the same block where the famous Tracy 168 Wildstyle crew lived a big influence on Uptown B-boys, and with the help of writer PHASE 2 renamed the crew the New York City Breakers. Holman then took some of the Breakers from Floor Master Crew Action, Kid Nice, Glide Master.Holman worked with Chino Lopez founder of The Floor Masters a visionary himself to find and recruit new members to build The New York City Breakers. Chino told Holman about a one in a million B-boy who would really make the crew a force to contend with. This mystery dancer turned out to be Tony Lopez aka Powerful Pexster who was everything Chino promised as a dancer and more, with Powerful Pexster's power moves extraordinaire some credit Pex with being one of the greatest Old School B-boys who ever rocked a floor. Chino's aka Action the master of neck moves, Noel Manguel's aka Kid Nice unique head glides, Mathew Caban aka Glide Master unbelievable fist glides, Lil Lep the wise one a head spin and swipe master the original five New York City Breakers were born. Soon after Lil Lep introduced his friend Bobby Potts aka Flip Rock who's flips and footwork instantly put him into the crew then after adding Tony Draughon aka Tony Mr.Wave Wesley, the New York City Breakers became one of the most famous and influential B-boy and hip-hop crews in the world. The first performance the original five New York City Breakers was on the nationally televised The Merv Griffin Show. Soon afterward, they began appearing on music videos like Gladys Knight Flash and the Furious Five, and live shows such as Soul Train, Ripley's Believe It or Not!, P.M. Magazine, CBS Evening News, Good Morning America, Amnesty International Gala, That's Incredible!. They also appeared in NBC's Salute to the Olympics. Sixteen Candles, Beat Street, are some of the feature films they appeared in. They also had a cameo in Body Rock. The New York City Breakers appeared on the first ever hip-hop TV show called Graffiti Rock they were featured in the book entitle \\"Breaking and The New York City Breakers\\" published in the fall of 1984 by Freundlich Books, and released an Album Break-Master featuring the New York City Breakers that went gold with Posters and array of how to break steps and how to judge a breaking competition battle. But are best known as the first ever hip-hop group or artists to perform in Washington D.C for a sitting president, Ronald Reagan, during the 1984, \\"Kennedy Center Honors.\\" The performance was broadcast nationally on CBS, and is considered a landmark for the acceptance of hip-hop culture in America mainstream While performing in tribute to legendary choreographer and Kennedy Center Honoree Katherine Dunham at the Kennedy Center Honors, the New York City Breakers befriended Frank Sinatra, also an Honoree that year who was so impressed by the New York City Breakers performance. After Beat Street world tour finished Glide Master crashed on a motorcycle that's when Chino Action Lopez found Lil Alex next generation of B-boys. Then Frank Sinatra wrote a letter to Chino invited the New York City Breakers to perform again at the 50th Presidential Inaugural Gala for Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush where Lil Alex performed his first and last show. Right afterward, the New York City Breakers officially broke up, to never perform together again. The New York City Breakers were one of the first hip-hop/B-boy crews that helped spread hip-hop culture around the globe. Touring and performing for Presidents, world leaders and royalty (including England's Duke of York Prince Andrew and the King and Queen of Norway), they will always be remembered as crucial pioneers of the B-boy and hip-hop culture.

After the period of 100 days cease-fire the hostilities broke out on 19 April 1995. The LTTE - Sea Tigers planted explosives in two gun boats known as SLNS 'Sooraya' and 'Ranasuru', and blew them up. Also, a new weapon \\"Stinger\\", a shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missile was used in this conflict by the LTTE. This was used to take down two Sri Lankan Air Force AVRO aircraft flying over the Jaffna peninsula. Eelam War III also marked the rising success of the LTTE, as they managed to capture key districts such as Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu, and took over the Elephant Pass base. By the end of Eelam War III, the LTTE had control of nearly 30% of the entire island.

Thus Eelam War III came to an end. Civilian killings =Kallarawa massacre= The Kallarawa massacre is an incident on May 25, 1995 during which LTTE cadres massacred 42 Sinhalese men, women and children in Kallarawa. All the remaining civilian survivors fled the village after this incident leading to its depopulation. However survivors from the Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim communities have returned to Kallarawa under the protection of the Sri Lankan Army. =Gonagala massacre= The Gongala Massacre was a massacre that occurred on September 18, 1999, in the small village of Gonagala, located in the Ampara District of Sri Lanka. According to reports, over 50 men, women and children were hacked to death in the middle of the night. The massacre is attributed to the LTTE, which is banned as a terrorist organization by a number of countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, India and the European Union. The Gonagala massacre is one of several such attacks believed to have been carried out by the LTTE. However these murders gained notoriety because, unlike previous attacks, most of the LTTE cadres who took part in it were women. According to survivors, there was a significant presence of female cadres among the 75 LTTE cadres who took part in the killings  Controversy over the Army's handling of its casualties and their families  In August 2001, S. P. Thamilselvan, the leader of the political wing of the Tamil Tigers, accused the Sri Lankan Army of intentionally abandoning the bodies of nearly a thousand soldiers on the battlefields since May, despite the Tamils‚Äô request that the Red Cross act as an intermediate. He told visiting relatives of missing servicemen that the military had only accepted 55 bodies to return to their families, while burying the rest with full military honors on the spot. Thamilselvan did not offer a reason for the army's refusal, but did note that several hundred decomposing bodies remained in a minefield due to the danger of extracting them. A Sri Lankan military spokesman, Brigadier Sanath Karunaratne, acknowledged that the army cannot always retrieve a body because it might cost more lives, but denied the Tamil accusations, saying they were propaganda aimed at demoralizing the parents of the missing soldiers. However, this was not the first time issues had arisen over reclamation of soldiers‚Äô remains and the Army's responsiveness to the requests of families of missing soldiers for information regarding their fate. In April 2003, a group of parents of some of the 619 soldiers reported missing from a battle fought 27 September 1998 obtained permission from the LTTE to travel to the battle site. The families‚Äô previous inquiries at the Defense Ministry, the Sri Lankan Army, and the International Committee of the Red Cross for information on their sons‚Äô fates had been fruitless. At the battlefield they learned that some 500 bodies had been piled together, doused with kerosene, and burnt on the spot by the Sri Lankan Army. Upon their return, a lawsuit was filed on the families‚Äô behalf requesting a mass funeral and DNA testing so Buddhist, Muslim and Christian families could collect their sons‚Äô remains and give them proper burials. The Ministry of Defence organized funeral in 2006, but declined to perform the requested DNA testing.

History  While there have been plans for a Jewish Museum dating back as far as 1928, the project did not gain significant momentum until the early 1980s when gallery owner Richard Grimm opened a private Jewish museum in a small space on Maximilianstra√üe. As the private collection gained popularity the need for a larger, public museum became apparent. However, Grimm's private museum closed after ten years for financial reasons and the Jewish community transferred the collection to a provisional exhibition space at Reichenbachstra√üe 27 where the Museum of the City of Munich presented exhibitions and events in collaboration with the City Archives, until the spring of 2006. It was then decided to build a municipal Jewish Museum as part of the new Jewish Center at Sankt-Jakobs-Platz.Jewish Museum Munich As an alternative to the mandatory national military service, young Austrians have the opportunity to serve as Austrian Holocaust Memorial Servants at the Jewish Museum Munich.

Travel time was about 14 hours over the route to Portland, Maine. The route was over the Pennsylvania Railroad from Washington through Philadelphia to New York City, then the New Haven Railroad to Groton, Connecticut, where it left the Northeast Corridor to reach the Boston and Maine Railroad at Worcester, Massachusetts, whereby it continued northeastward, bypassing Boston. The train continued over the Boston & Maine to Portland, where a coach and diner continued to Bangor, Maine, on the connecting Pine Tree Limited. In contrast to the other Mid-Atlantic to Maine trains, it was the only day and evening train.Jones, Robert Willoughby, Boston and Maine (1991). Trans-Anglo Books p.96 Equipment Service started in June 1940 with two sets of pooled passenger cars painted yellow with a silver window band and pinstripes. Each train had an arch-roof baggage car, a dining car, and as many as eight lightweight coaches. The New Haven and Boston & Maine provided American Flyer coaches built in the 1930s by the Pullman Company's former Osgood Bradley Car Company plant in Worcester. The New Haven provided a similar grill car, while the Pennsylvania Railroad provided P-70 coaches and a lounge car. Similar service ran in the summers of 1941 and 1942. Later years The East Wind did not run during the summers of 1943, 1944 and 1945. Service resumed in the summer of 1946 without the distinctive paint scheme of the earlier years. Instead of turning north at Groton, the train now passed through Providence, Rhode Island, where it made a stop.New Haven Timetable, June 2, 1946, Table 44 By its final years the route went north at New Haven, going to Hartford Union Station, then turning east through Willimantic, Putnam, Worcester and northward.New Haven Timetable, April 24, 1955, Table 18 Dining cars were sometimes leased from the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, or Boston and Maine or New Haven heavyweight diners were used. The New Haven diners were sometimes painted silver. The train ran for the last time in the summer of 1955. Legacy Guilford Rail System used the name East Wind in 1995 for a through piggyback service of semi-trailers on flatcars between Springfield, Massachusetts, and Bangor, Maine.

Named for Oceanus (believed to be the world-ocean in classical antiquity), she was the only US Naval vessel to bear the name. Construction The ship was laid down as LST‚Äì328 on 12 November 1942, at the Philadelphia Navy Yard; redesignated ARB-2 on 25 January 1943, she was then launched on 11 February 1943, and commissioned on 22 May 1943 with Lieutenant Commander W. B. Studley in command. Service history Following shakedown in Chesapeake Bay, Oceanus departed Norfolk, Virginia on 23 July 1943 for the Pacific, arriving at Noum√©a, New Caledonia 18 September. She remained there, converting LCIs to shoal-draft gunboats and making emergency repairs to damaged vessels. On 28 October, she shifted to Espiritu Santo, thence, departing on 1 July 1944, to Florida Island. On 9 September 1944, she departed the Solomon Islands in TG 31.4 and on 20 September, arrived at Kossol Roads, Palaus. There she repaired, often while underway, craft and vessels damaged in the assaults against those islands and against the Philippines. In February 1945, she steamed to Guam to join TG 51.5 for the Iwo Jima invasion, arriving on 20 February, and remaining until 17 March. The Okinawa campaign next took Oceanus to Kerama Retto, where work on ships damaged by kamikazes and bombs kept her on a round-the-clock schedule into mid-May. On 14 May, she shifted to the Hagushi anchorage for emergency repairs to the battleship . Completing the work and returning to Kerama Retto's \\"Scrap Iron Row\\" on 21 May, she remained until early June when she steamed to the Philippines. Arriving at Leyte 15 June, she remained in San Pedro Bay until after the end of the War. Post-war Post-war duties took her to Okinawa, then to China. At Shanghai from October into December, she serviced landing and patrol craft assigned to China Group. On 25 December, she headed back to the United States to prepare for inactivation. Decommissioned 15 January 1947, she was berthed at San Diego, as a unit of the Pacific Reserve Fleet until struck from the Naval Vessel Register 1 July 1961, and sold 3 May 1962 to Zidell Exploration of Portland, Oregon for scrapping.

From a musical reorientation the band changed their name to Art in 1967, and released the album Supernatural Fairy Tales. Career The band members at various times were: Mike Harrison (lead vocals) (ex Dino and the Danubes, The Dakotas, The Ramrods); Greg Ridley (bass guitar) (ex Dino and the Danubes, The Dakotas); Frank Kenyon (rhythm guitar) (1963‚Äì67) (born 12 October 1945, Carlisle) (ex The Teenages, The Ramrods); Jimmy Henshaw (lead guitar) (1963‚Äì67) (born James Henshaw, 20 October 1941, in Newarthill, near Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, Scotland died 1 May 2007, Carlisle) (ex The Ramrods); Keith Emerson (organ) (ex-Gary Farr & The T-Bones) (1966‚Äì1967); Luther Grosvenor (lead guitar) (1967); Walter Johnstone (drummer) (1963‚Äì67) (born 11 March 1943, Carlisle) (ex The Teenages, The Ramrods); and Mike Kellie (drummer) (1967). When Emerson left in early 1967 to form The Nice, Harrison, Ridley, Grosvenor and Kellie changed their name to 'Art', and released one album, Supernatural Fairy Tales, produced by Guy Stevens, covering Stephen Stills' \\"What's That Sound (For What It's Worth)\\" and Felix Cavaliere's \\"Come On Up\\". The band then disbanded, with all four members of the group's final line-up forming Spooky Tooth with American musician Gary Wright later that same year. They also participated in a psychedelic album entitled Featuring The Human Host And The Heavy Metal Kids by a collective known as Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, formed by Guy Stevens and an influential British graphic design and avant-garde musical partnership between Michael English and Nigel Waymouth. The musicians involved in that project were Mike Harrison on keys and vocals, Luther Grosvenor on guitars, Greg Ridley on bass and Mike Kellie on drums, as well as Stevens, English and Waymouth. It was the first time that the term heavy metal was ever used in music, even though that album had nothing to do with heavy metal music, being closer to psychedelic music. The album was issued in 1967 by Liberty Records and contained only five songs from two minutes to more than 15 minutes of psychedelic and almost meditative state kind of music.

(3 November 1785 - 12 July 1844), was a French aristocrat and prelate who was a founder of the Fathers of Mercy, established in an effort to re-evangelize the French people. He preached throughout North America, taking an active role in reviving the Catholic populations of the United States and Canada. He was influential in establishing an ultramontane stand in the Catholic Church in French-speaking Canada, an influence which would last for generations. Forbin-Janson also served as the Bishop of Nancy and Toul, and later was the founder of the Association of the Holy Childhood, which worked to support the Catholic Church in its work on the expanding frontiers of North America. Life =Early life= Born in Paris, he was the second son of Count Michel-Palam√®de de Forbin-Janson and of his wife, Corn√©lie-Henriette-Sophie-Louise-Hortense- Gabrielle, Princess of Gal√©an. He was a Knight of Malta from childhood. During the French Revolution, his family took refuge in Bavaria, which was his home until he returned to France in 1800, having been trained for a military career. Though he was to remain an ardent monarchist throughout his life, he accepted the appointment which Napoleon Bonaparte gave him as an Auditor of the Council of State in 1805. His family and the aristocracy looked forward to a most brilliant career as a statesman for him, but at the same time he joined the Congregation of the Holy Virgin (), a religious association of the laity organized in Paris in 1801, which had grown out of the Jesuit-affiliated Sodality of Our Lady after the Suppression of the Society of Jesus. In the spring of 1808 Forbin-Janson surprised all by entering the Seminary of Saint- Sulpice. Because of the hostilities instigated by Napoleon against Pope Pius VII he had given up his career in government and decided to become a priest. There he met a group of young seminarians at Saint-Sulpice who were caught up in the idea of missionary work, and the impetuous Forbin-Janson became imbued with this vision. He became close friends with Eug√®ne de Mazenod, who entertained similar dreams, and who was later to found the missionary order of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate. Forbin-Janson was ordained a priest in Chamb√©ry, Savoie, on 15 December 1811, by Ir√©n√©e-Yves Desolle, Bishop of Chamb√©ry. and was made Superior of the seminary of the diocese. Nevertheless, he still determined to become a missionary. Later, in 1814, while serving as the acting Vicar General of the diocese, he traveled to Rome where Pope Pius VII advised him to remain in France where missionary work was needed. He immediately heeded the advice, and, with his friend, the Abb√© Jean-Baptiste Rauzan, re-established the Missionaries of France, later called the Society of the Fathers of Mercy, based at Mont-Val√©rien, in the Parisian suburb of Suresnes. =Missionary life= The Fathers of Mercy established the practice of visiting the homes of a town in which they had established themselves in order to draw the people to services of preaching on the Catholic faith. This practice met with great success in all parts of France. The climax of one such mission was the raising of a Calvary on Mont Val√©rien. Forbin-Janson had a great attachment to the huge cross, which was visible from Paris, and became a favorite place of pilgrimage for the people of the city. He paid for both its construction and its later maintenance out of his own considerable wealth. In 1817 Forbin-Janson was sent to Syria on a mission, returned to France in 1819, and again took up the work of a missionary in his homeland until 1823 when he was appointed Bishop of Nancy and Toul and Primate of Lorraine, for which he was consecrated at the chapel of the Society on Mont-Val√©rien on 6 June 1824 by Gustave Maximilien Juste de Cro√ø-Solre, the Archbishop of Rouen. A co- consecrator was Jean-Louis Lefebvre de Cheverus, for many years the Bishop of Boston, then the Bishop of Montauban. Also present at the consecration was the American Bishop of Cincinnati, John Baptist Purcell. As a steadfast monarchist, Forbin-Janson became associated with the policies of King Charles X of France. That stand and his authoritarian manner of ruling caused him to be unpopular with both the people and clergy of his diocese. In the course of the Revolution of July 1830, when King Charles was overthrown, rioters attacked and ransacked both the bishop's palace and the local seminary. His beloved cross on Mont-Val√©rian was also destroyed during this upheaval. Seen as a problem by the new government of King Louis Philippe for his views and his refusal to sign the Declaration of the Clergy of France of 1682 which was rejected by the Holy See, he was not allowed to return to his diocese. He succeeded, however, in getting his own choice of a coadjutor bishop by threatening to return to Nancy. Once Forbin-Janson was freed of his duties as a bishop, he began to travel around the country, accepting invitations to preach from various bishops and religious houses. He became known as a generous benefactor of missionary activity. He aided Pauline Jaricot in the establishment of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, which had been founded to aid missionaries in the United States, as a result of which, his thoughts turned to North America. He was, in fact, receiving a steady stream of invitations from compatriots holding episcopal office there. He went to Rome, where Pope Gregory XVI supported his vision and gave him an official mandate for a missionary tour through the United States of America. America Forbin-Janson arrived in New York on 18 October 1839. Though he did not stay in that city long, while there, he realized that there was no place of worship specifically for French speakers. To answer this need, he commissioned the construction of the Church of St. Vincent de Paul there. He made periodic visits to the city to check on its progress. During the next two years there, he traveled around the country, giving missions to the people and retreats to the clergy. All the large cities of the country, from New York City to Dubuque; from New Orleans to Quebec City, were to become witnesses of his zeal. New Orleans was the first conspicuous field of his success, as he preached the traditional sermons for Lent in the cathedral there. As would become the pattern of his mission, the preaching ended with the founding of a temperance society as a collective social commitment. In a letter to a friend he later noted that their success \\"exceeded all expectations,\\" despite his apprehensions. While on his way there, from his own personal funds he contributed one-third of the money with which the Fathers of Mercy bought Spring Hill College (later a Jesuit institution) near Mobile, Alabama, thereby establishing their presence in the country. Forbin-Janson then attended the Fourth Provincial Council of Baltimore, held May 1840, where the Council Fathers granted him a right to vote. Forbin-Janson then traveled to Quebec, where he was more at home due to his mother tongue being spoken there. He gave his first sermon on Sunday, 6 September 1840, in the cathedral. There followed a two-week retreat with 5,000‚Äì6,000 participants regularly attending the daily sermons, each about an hour and a half long. His stirring eloquence brought about a religious revival which in a traditionally Catholic society which was facing apathy and competition from French-speaking Swiss Hugenots, who had begun to preach in the colony. As a victim of both the French Revolution and the July Revolution, which had had an influence on the Rebellions of 1837 in Lower Canada, the French bishop, just by his very presence, reinforced in people's minds an apprehension of the misfortunes such upheavals produced. Some of his biographers have judged that, as an intransigent reactionary, he would prepare the way for the ultramontane clericalism that Ignace Bourget, the Bishop of Montreal would use to full advantage in both the religious and the political spheres. Further, some events regarded as supernatural kept his memory alive for many years among the French-Canadian people. The high point of Forbin-Janson's apostolate in Lower Canada was the raising of an immense cross on Mont Saint-Hilaire that was a counterpart to the one on Mont-Val√©rien which had been destroyed. Standing nearly 100 feet (30 meters) high and 30 feet (9 meters) wide, it was lit through openings, and people could climb rungs to the top. The cross was inaugurated and blessed with an elaborate ceremony on 6 October 1841. It served as a landmark and place of pilgrimage until it was destroyed by a storm in 1846, after which it was replaced by a chapel, which stood another 30 years on the site. Forbin-Janson's last visit in the United States was to Philadelphia, in November 1841, where he assisted at the consecration of Peter Richard Kenrick as coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of St. Louis. =Final years= Forbin-Janson left New York for France in December 1841, and the next year traveled to Rome to give an account of his mission in America. Pope Gregory named him a Roman Count and Assistant at the Pontifical Throne \\"because of his wonderful zeal for the propagation and defense of the Catholic Faith in the United States of America\\". The pope, however, declined to intervene on his behalf with the French government, and, despite a request, the bishop refused to resign. In August 1842 Forbin-Janson went to London to intervene with Lord Stanley, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, on behalf of the Canadian rebels. On his return to France he wanted to start a project intended to interest Christian children in Europe in the fate of children in China. He presented the idea to the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, but there was no interest in expanding its mission in that direction. Consequently, in 1843 he founded the Society of the Holy Childhood, and spent that, and a part of the following year, in spreading this good work through France, Belgium and England. Forbin-Janson died unexpectedly at his family castle of Les Aygalades, now part of the City of Marseilles. He was buried in the Picpus Cemetery in Paris, in a section reserved for aristocracy who had been killed during the French Revolution.

It was released in Japan by Enix on September 25, 1998, and co- published by Eidos Interactive in Europe and North America in 2000. It was the first Dragon Quest game to be released in Europe. The game cartridge is compatible with both the black-and-white Game Boy and the Game Boy Color; a second printing of the game was made after the Game Boy Color itself was released. The game was remade for the PlayStation in a compilation Dragon Quest Monsters 1+2 Hoshi Furi no Y≈´sha to Bokuj≈ç no Nakamatachi. A mobile phone incarnation titled Dragon Quest Monsters i was released in Japan on January 28, 2002. The game features the characters Terry and Milly from Dragon Quest VI when they were children, before the events in Dragon Quest VI. Dragon Warrior Monsters is often compared to the Pok√©mon series due to their similar gameplay. Critics set the games apart by noting the in-depth breeding system seen in this game. In May 2012, a remake of the game for the Nintendo 3DS, titled Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry no Wonderland 3D, was released. Later in November 2018, the remake was released for smartphones  Gameplay  The game follows Terry as he attempts to save his sister. Instead of fighting in battle, Terry is able to recruit monsters into his party. When fighting random battles, Terry can set out meat, which may coax the monster into joining the party at the end of the battle. Terry can also breed two monsters, combining them into a new, stronger monster. Excess monsters can be placed on the Farm, a storage place for monsters. They can be picked up or dropped off and there is an option to put monsters at the farm to sleep, which allows them to maintain their wilderness level, but not grow in level. There can be 19 awake and 19 asleep monsters at any one time. A monster's wilderness level lowers as Terry trains them, which makes them more likely to participate in battle. By leaving monsters at the farm awake, they become more wild. Just like in most RPGs, monsters are able to gain experience points and level up after battles. Each monsters' requirements for experience points to level up varies, depending on their plus number or even what monster family they belong to. When they level up, they gain stats and sometimes skills. All monsters can carry a maximum of eight skills; if a monster can gain more than eight skills you have the option of replacing old skills with new ones. The player moves around to other worlds through warp gates which are located underneath the throne room. To access these gates, the player needs to defeat a certain class ranking. There are a certain number of areas in a world and at the last one, the player needs to defeat a boss. Some bosses in the game offer to join the player's party automatically, some have to be won over with meat, and some will not join at all. Other gates are hidden throughout Great Tree, such as one in the library that is only accessible after befriending over 100 different monsters. In this game the player fights in the arena and goes through ranks that consists of three different battles that must be won before the player can advance to the next ranking. Each rank provides harder challenges: the higher the rank, the harder the monsters. The battles you able to start at are from Rank G and go to Rank D and later in the game you are able to go from Rank C to Rank A and then Rank S. These battles open up gates for the character to explore and are necessary to progress through the story. Tiny Medals are scattered throughout different worlds randomly and are picked up by the player. In the game, there is a man who collects these medals, who is later revealed to be the king of Great Tree, and will give certain monster eggs for how many the player gives to him. Also, Foreign Masters may appear while in other worlds. These encounters with other trainers can result in battle. There are different types of trainers that will give or do something for the player if they are defeated. These trainers monsters may also join you if you give them meat. The game also comes compatible with the PlayStation's i-mode adaptor, allowing players to upload monsters from the game onto the mobile phone version of Dragon Quest Monsters. = Breeding = After beating Class F in the Arena, the player can breed monsters if they are at level 10 or above at the Shrine of Starry Night, which is taken care of by the current Master Monster Tamer. Breeding requires one male and one female monster. The result of the breeding will be an egg, containing a level 1 monster which has characteristics of both parents, including skills and stats. The egg can then be left in the monster farm or hatched, which costs a small fee. The monster born will have a plus number next to it, the number generally signifying the greatness of the monster's stats, the higher being the better. It costs more money to hatch a monster with a higher plus number than one with no plus number. Also, the number beside the plus multiplied by two is added to the limit for the maximum level for the monster. Once the Egg Evaluator is available for use, eggs can have the gender of the monster they're containing checked and changed. Both requires a small fee which is paid to the Egg Evaluator. The fee increases depending on the monster's plus number. A monster that was created through breeding has much higher stats and many more abilities than a monster that was found in the wild, thus it is much harder to complete the game without breeding many generations. Breeding is also the only way to acquire certain monsters. Also, the monsters that bred to make the egg leave you.  Story  In the days before Dragon Quest VI, when Terry and Milly were just children, a strange monster appeared one night and snatched Milly away. Soon after, another monster, similar to the kidnapper, appeared and told Terry his sister was kidnapped by the evil Warubou. He informs Terry that his name is Watabou and must accompany him to the Kingdom of GreatTree. After his arrival, Terry met the King and received Slib the slime, his first monster to train. If Terry wins the Monster Trainer's Starry Night Tournament, he will be granted a wish. So Terry sets out with his team to explore the many monster dungeons to win the tournament and rescue his sister.  Nintendo 3DS remake  The Nintendo 3DS remake was announced in September 2011 by publisher Square Enix, and was said to include new monsters, a new story, and additional monsters from Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker 2 Professional. The game was shown as a playable demo at Jump Magazines Jump Festa in December 2011. The game features include shifting from day to night, randomized dungeon layouts, combat with four opponents on each side, and a total of 609 monsters, including all the monsters from the original Game Boy Color release. The game also features an in-game Wi-Fi Store in the bazaar area. The Wi-Fi Store purchases can be made with the in-game currency, gold. The store's items changes daily, and the Wi-Fi item store is only open after doing that day's Wi-Fi Ranking Battle. It can be used to buy monster eggs, (white, silver, and rainbow eggs) skill books, consumable items, and some weapons. Players have the ability to import monsters they have raised from Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker 2 and Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker 2 Professional (Rank A and higher only) through a free app upon completion of the game. At that point, players can access \\"Ultimate Combination\\", where new abilities become available for the players monsters, and the ability to create \\"super monsters\\" is possible. X and XY monsters (+, and +* in the original Japanese version) in Joker 2/Professional could be obtained by synthesizing 2 of the same monsters, level 20 for X, and level 50 for XY monsters. However, the method to create them is different in Terry's Wonderland 3D. Both duplicate monsters of different gender have to have their monster's rank points +25 for + monsters, and +50 for +* monsters. In Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry's Wonderland 3D, there is a +, and +* for every monster, while in Joker 2/Professional not every monster had them. After synthesizing a few of these monsters, a new synth will happen immediately afterwards, making a demon book monster that knows said monsters skills. There are more than a few kinds of demon book monsters ranging from small size to large size monsters. Using the StreetPass feature of the Nintendo 3DS, players can fight other players and attempt to steal their monsters. Miis are also utilized in the game, allowing players to customize their character's clothing. Online play is supported, including \\"Grand Prix\\" mode for a maximum of eight players. In B3 of the Great Tree, one of the two gates there takes you to an arena where you can battle the top 3 users who've won that day's ranking battle. You can do auto commands, AI battle tactics, and use items. The users are AIs, and their data are recorded from said day's ranking battle. You get both bonus points (for Wi-Fi Ranking Battle) and gold. The other gate there takes you to a 100 battle survival course. After 50 battles, it auto saves. If you lose between 51-100, you get to start back at battle 50. These battles can only be done once every 24 hours.  Reception  In Japan, Dragon Warrior Monsters sold 2.35 million copies, of which 1.22 million were sold during 1998‚Äîmaking it the fourth-highest selling game of the year. The North American version sold 60,000 copies by April 2000. Dragon Warrior Monsters received mostly positive reviews, receiving an average score of 78.9% from GameRankings based on 12 reviews. The game was compared to Pok√©mon by critics because of its similar gameplay, many telling fans to play the game as a means of waiting for the release of Pok√©mon Gold and Silver. GameSpot.com praised the game's visuals, music, and gameplay, stating that the game \\"may not have the cutesy, over-merchandised appeal of Pok√©mon, but the rock-solid gameplay makes it a worthwhile endeavor.\\" IGN stated that Dragon Warrior Monsters features many of Pok√©mon's mechanics, \\"but better,\\" commenting on the game's large cast of monsters and battles. However, IGN also made a distinction between the two games, saying that Pok√©mon's ability to capture any wild Pok√©mon with a Pok√© Ball as opposed to taming monsters was a better idea. RPGFan.com reviewed the game, mentioning that the game's 215 monsters gave the game a large amount of depth, and that the \\"bulk and the most fun aspect of the game is catching monsters and breeding them to get more powerful monsters.\\" Gaming-Age.com similarly pointed out that the breeding aspect of Dragon Warrior Monsters set it apart from other monster-catching games, noting that its monsters \\"don't quite have the extra 'omph' that the creatures do\\", but that \\"none of the creatures are so super cutesy that they begin to get on your nerves.\\" PlayStation compilation Dragon Quest Monsters 1+2 received a 33 out of 40 by Famitsu magazine.„Éó„É¨„Ç§„Çπ„ÉÜ„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ - „Éâ„É©„Ç¥„É≥„ÇØ„Ç®„Çπ„Éà„É¢„É≥„Çπ„Çø„Éº„Ç∫1„Éª2 ÊòüÈôç„Çä„ÅÆÂãáËÄÖ„Å®ÁâßÂ†¥„ÅÆ‰ª≤Èñì„Åü„Å°.

It is the second Dragon Warrior Monsters game for the Game Boy Color and features two different versions of the same game, Cobi's Journey (released as Dragon Quest Monsters 2 - Maruta No Fushigi Na Kagi - Ruka no Tabidachi in Japan) and Tara's Adventure (released as Dragon Quest Monsters 2: Maruta No Fushigi Na Kagi - Iru no Bouken in Japan). Both games were remade in 2002 for the PlayStation in a compilation game called Dragon Quest Monsters 1+2 and released only in Japan. The Nintendo 3DS version combined both games into one and was released only in Japan in 2014 with the title Dragon Quest Monsters 2: Iru and Luca's Marvelous Mysterious Key. Gameplay Dragon Warrior Monsters 2 allows the player to form a team of monsters to train and use in combat. Depending on which version of the game players buy, Dragon Warrior Monsters 2: Cobi's Journey or Dragon Warrior Monsters 2: Tara's Adventure, they control either Cobi or Tara, but the titles are nearly identical in gameplay and story. Both games, however, possess unique collections of monsters and magic keys. Instead of the original games focus on randomized dungeons, this title focuses on static ones with tasks to complete, though randomized dungeons are still available for exploration. The player can have three monsters out at a time, and the rest remain at the siblings fathers ranch. To catch monsters, players must encounter them and entice them by offering them food and treats, and at the end of battle if it has been won over will join the player. If players give the monsters they have caught food and affection, it makes them more likely to follow specific commands during battle. Monsters also learn skills over time through battle. Monsters can also be bred by taking any level 10 male and female monster pair to Professor Monster at the Starry Shrine, after which their offspring appears and the parents disappear. After the game story ends, players are free to find more magic keys and unlock more worlds for monster finding and breeding, as well as searching out new items. There are over three hundred monsters from eleven families to collect, including some from the then recently released Dragon Quest VII. The game has Game Boy link cable support to facilitate two player battles against each other or together against the games AI, as well as allowing monster trading with players who had either version of the game. During player versus player combat, there is a possibility of stealing some of the other players monsters. To get all the keys available in the game, players must link up with another player playing the other version of the game. With the keys from the other title, all of the available worlds can be unlocked in the players own game. The PlayStation compilation featured improved graphics, new scenarios, and the ability to upload monsters players have caught to the i-Mode cellular version of the original Dragon Quest Monsters. =3DS Version= The Nintendo 3DS remake had new gameplay features such as a total of 800 monsters, allowed four monsters in a party, and featured several ‚ÄúG size‚Äù giant monsters. Players can also do a scout attack to see their probability of catching the monsters they encounter. The remake also has a new way to breed monsters to be powerful; ‚ÄúS.S.‚Äù level faster than before called ‚ÄúNew Life Fusion‚Äù. A system of creating your own monsters was also included, with players able to mix and match four different parts of a monsters body to create a custom one. Players can also make use of Nintendos StreetPass system of fighting over WiFi, either sending their party out to fight another player, or downloading another players party to fight against without them. There is also a special monster called Dracky StreetPass users can find, and players can also customize their character avatars with different clothing options. Plot Cobi and Tara are both in a family of monster breeders who have come to the island of Greatlog to make a living by opening a monster ranch. However, there is soon conflict with the island's prince Kameha and a character from the original Dragon Quest Monsters named Warubou who is his assistant. Because of this duo's bad behavior, the island begins to sink, and Cobi or Tara must explore five different worlds to find magic keys, and the plug, to save the island. In the Nintendo 3DS remake, the citizens are disturbed by a new threat after the original story ends, with the siblings having to find the ‚ÄúUltimate Key‚Äù to open the door to two new worlds called ‚ÄúNew World‚Äù and the ‚ÄúLegendary Demonlords‚Äù with gigantic and powerful enemies.  Development  The original two games were exclusively Game Boy Color games and were not backwards compatible to the original Game Boy. The games also used the largest cartridge available for the Game Boy Color game system, which was four megabytes. Enix developer John Lawrence stated that Enix wanted to give players options in Dragon Quest Monsters 2 where they could play the game as a solo RPG, but created two parts of the game to encourage players to have a social experience of playing together like an enhanced version of the original Dragon Quest Monsters or like Pokemon. The 3DS remake was demonstrated at Jump Fiesta 2014 with a playable demo and trailer. Reception The week it was released, the game was the number one selling game in Japan and sold 501,081 copies. According to Famitsu, Dragon Warrior Monsters 2 has sold 1,592,728 copies in Japan, and was the number three best selling game in Japan in 2001. Dragon Warrior Monsters 2 received generally positive reception, holding an average rating of 81% on Game Rankings for both versions. Like Dragon Warrior Monsters before it, this game was immediately compared to Pok√©mon, a series with similar monster-catching gameplay. However, IGN regarded it as being more than just a mere \\"Pok√©mon clone\\", though also comparing it to the game Monster Rancher. RPGFan praised the system of breeding monsters as ‚Äúincredibly fun‚Äù, and noted the high degree of replay value because of the post-story monster collecting activities players can do. PlayStation compilation Dragon Quest Monsters 1+2 received a 33 out of 40 by Famitsu magazine.„Éó„É¨„Ç§„Çπ„ÉÜ„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ - „Éâ„É©„Ç¥„É≥„ÇØ„Ç®„Çπ„Éà„É¢„É≥„Çπ„Çø„Éº„Ç∫1„Éª2 ÊòüÈôç„Çä„ÅÆÂãáËÄÖ„Å®ÁâßÂ†¥„ÅÆ‰ª≤Èñì„Åü„Å°.

He was in office from May 11, 1918 until the entire government was forced into exile by the advancing Bolsheviks in 1921. His official title was General Tchermoeff, Prime Minister of the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus. Early life Born in Grozny, Chechnya, in 1882, Tapa was the eldest son of the well-known General Ortsou Tchermoeff. He was educated at the Vladikavkaz secondary school and at the Nicolayevsky Cavalry College in St. Petersburg. He graduated in 1901 and joined an elite military unit, His Majesty Tsar Nicholas II's Own Life Guard Convoy. Tapa Tchermoeff married Princess Khavarsultan Khanim Ibrahimbeyova of Persia in 1906. Although still a young man he was obliged to leave the army in 1908 when his father died. During this time he threw himself into economic and industrial activities. His family owned important parcels of oil-bearing land in the Grozny area. Tapa automatically became one of the most active and energetic pioneers of the Grozny oil industry. World War I interrupted Tapa's economic activity. He joined the famous native Savage Division of the Imperial Russian Army with the rank of Captain. In the war he proved himself a brilliant military leader and a fearless soldier. After the October Revolution Tapa returned to his native land intent to stem the rise of Bolshevism in Chechnya.

Tapa believed the unifying of all Caucasian highlanders to be the only way of saving the Northern Caucasus from the Bolsheviks. On his initiative and thanks to his unrelenting energy a convention of Caucasian highlanders took place in March 1917. This meeting resolved to form an independent highland state. On 11 May 1918 the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus was officially established. Tapa was first the prime minister and then the minister for foreign affairs. Early in March 1919, Tapa headed a delegation to Paris in an attempt to take part in the Treaty of Versailles.

Construction The two deck steamer was laid down in July 1917 by the National Shipbuilding Company of Orange, Texas as Hull No. 245. Shortages of materials meant that she was wooden-hulled, with a steel keelson, stem and stern posts of oak, and timbers largely of yellow pine. This was due to shortages of metals. SS Argenta was launched in May 1919. Cargo ship Argentas career as a cargo ship was short. As early as November 1919, there were some signs of leakage, and the ship was out of service from late 1921. Condemned and declared unseaworthy in May 1922, she was then sold for use as a prison ship (a prison hulk) by the British Royal Navy.  Prison ship  During the 1920s, the vessel was used by the British government as a military base and prison ship for holding Irish Republicans as part of Britain's internment strategy following the events of \\"Bloody Sunday\\" in 1920. By February 1923, under the 1922 Special Powers Act the British were detaining 263 men on the Argenta, which was moored in Belfast Lough. This was supplemented with internment at other land based sites, such as Larne workhouse, Belfast Prison and Derry Gaol. Together, both the ship and the workhouse alone held 542 men without trial at the highest internment population level during June 1923. Conditions on the prison ship Argenta were \\"unbelievable\\" according to Denise Kleinrichert who wrote the hidden history of the 1920s' \\"floating gulag\\" in Republican Internment and the Prison Ship Argenta, 1922. Cloistered below decks in cages which held 50 internees, the prisoners were forced to use broken toilets, which overflowed frequently into their communal area. Deprived of tables, the already weakened men ate off the floor, frequently succumbing to disease and illness as a result. There were several hunger strikes, including a major strike involving upwards of 150 men in the winter of 1923. In 2011 a rare and unusual autograph book from the Argenta, with a large number of signatures of prisoners, almost all with Northern Ireland addresses, mostly late 1922, was auctioned by Mealys Rare Books Limited. Signatures include M√≠che√°l mac Eochaidh, W. Quillan, Packie Murphy, J.P.

It has rough, flaky to fibrous bark on its trunk, smooth bark above, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves that are much paler on the lower side, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and hemispherical fruit.flower buds Description Eucalyptus cloeziana is a tree that typically grows to a height of in forest but usually in woodland. It has thick, rough, fibrous to flaky, brownish to grey bark on the trunk and smooth grey to orange bark on the branches. Leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are egg-shaped, long and wide and a lighter shade of green on the lower side. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The leaves are dull green and a much lighter shade on the lower side. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils on a branching inflorescence, each branch with seven buds on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are spherical to oval, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering occurs in December and January and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical capsule long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus cloeziana was first formally described in 1878 by Ferdinand von Mueller from a specimen collected near Rockingham Bay by John Dallachy. The description was published in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. The specific epithet (cloeziana) honours Fran√ßois Stanislas Cloez who identified cineole as the major constituent of eucalyptus oil. Distribution and habitat Gympie messmate has a widespread but scattered distribution in Queensland, particularly from east of Tambo to Mundubbera and Gympie, and from west of Townsville to north-west of Cooktown with isolated occurrences in between. It grows in open forest and woodland on tablelands and slopes and is often the dominant species of tree.Brooker, I. & Kleinig, D., Eucalyptus, An illustrated guide to identification, Reed Books, Melbourne, 1996 References cloeziana Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Trees of Australia Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Plants described in 1878 Category:Taxa named by Ferdinand von Mueller ","title":"Eucalyptus cloeziana"},{"id":"10550855","text":"Khak aur Khoon (ÿÆÿß⁄© ÿßŸàÿ± ÿÆŸàŸÜ) is a historical novel by Nasƒ´m ·∏§ijƒÅzƒ´ that describes the sacrifices of Muslims of the Indian sub-continent during the time of partition in 1947. When Muslims of different regions were trying to get to Pakistan, many groups of Hindus would to attack them during their journeys to snatch their money and the jewellery of the women. The Hindus robbed everybody they found in the way. Khak aur Khoon not only describes how many sacrifices the Muslims made to get their new homeland, but it also describes the true face of Hindu fanaticism at the time. On June 3, 1947, Lord Mountbatton announced that district of Gurdaspur was going to be aligned with Pakistan. Muslims, after listening to this, guarded the homes and properties of their Non-Muslim neighbours from the riots, but Radcliff gifted this district to India to enable Kashmir to join India. Even the king of Kashmir, Hari Singh wanted it to be mixed with India. Plot The novel revolves around the life of the protagonist Saleem, who is the son of a Tahsildar and belongs to a very influential yet virtuous joint-family. The First part of the novel is all about the childhood of the protagonist. It's all smiles and laughters, and there are a lot of fascinating yet hilarious events which make the reader addicted to the story-line. Saleem, being the benchmark of excellence in both academics and sports is brought with a great set of values. After receiving primary education in his village. In order to continue his further studies, he goes to a college where he meets with young enthusiastic individuals of All India Muslim League who have been working for the cause of an Independent State. This cause becomes his aspiration and he goes to the last extent for it. Then, after the establishment of Pakistan, it's all about the atrocities faced by the Muslim migrants. During the days of migration, a ferocious armed combat between the Muslims of Saleem's village, and Sikh militants, Saleem's whole family is martyred despite fighting selflessly. Saleem survives and selflessly goes on with the cause and to help the migrants with this painful journey. Saleem marries Asmat, the girl Saleem has always been in love with and the sister of his high-school friend Amjad. The novel ends on a very emotional note with Majeed leading a battalion to the Kashmir front and Saleem being extremely grateful and content with his contribution in the establishment of Pakistan.

Origins He was born in 1262 at Allesley,Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, new edition, VI, p.346 near Coventry in Warwickshire, the eldest son of Henry de Hastings (c.1235‚Äìc.1268) who was summoned to Parliament by Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester as Lord Hastings in 1263. Although following the defeat of de Montfort this peerage creation was not recognized by King Henry III, John Hastings is sometimes referred to as the second Baron Hastings. His mother (whose father William III de Cantilupe (d.1254) had purchased the wardship and marriage of Henry de Hastings) was the great heiress Joanna de Cantilupe (d.1271), one of the two sisters and co-heiresses of Sir George de Cantilupe (1251-1273), 4th feudal baron of Eaton Bray in Bedfordshire and feudal Lord of Abergavenny. Career In 1273 he became the 13th Lord of Abergavenny on the death of his childless uncle Sir George de Cantilupe, and thereby acquired Abergavenny Castle and the vast lands of the honour of Abergavenny. He also inherited many Cantilupe estates including Aston Cantlow in Warwickshire, one of that family's seats. He fought from the 1290s in the Scottish, Irish and French wars of King Edward I and held the offices of Seneschal of Gascony and Lieutenant of Aquitaine simultaneously. In 1290 he had unsuccessfully contested the crown of the Kingdom of Scotland as grandson of Ada, third daughter of David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon, who was a grandson of King David I of Scotland. Also in 1290 he was summoned to the English Parliament as Lord Hastings,‚ÄúHe ‚Ä¶ is recorded to have been present in pleno parliamento domini Regis on the morrow of Trinity 18 Edw.

They were built at the Wolverhampton railway works of the Great Western Railway between 1897 and 1905. 1897 was the very year of George Armstrong's retirement, so it is uncertain if the design should be attributed to him or to his superior at Swindon, William Dean. In fact the 2021s were simple enlargements of the Armstrong-designed 850 class of 1874. The changes were fundamentally confined to a longer wheelbase to permit fitting of a larger firebox. History The class was built in eight batches: * 2021-2030 (Lot D3, 1897) * 2031-2040 (Lot F3, 1897-8) * 2041-2060 (Lot G3, 1898-9) * 2061-2080 (Lot H3, 1899-1900) * 2081-2100 (Lot J3, 1900-01) * 2101-2120 (Lot K3, 1902-3) * 2121-2140 (Lot L3, 1903-4) * 2141-2160 (Lot M3, 1904-5) Rebuilding with Belpaire fireboxes commenced in the early years of the Churchward era. Unsuccessful attempts to form a saddle tank around the firebox directly led to the switch to pannier tanks. The rebuilding of the whole class took place over many years. In their final form, with or without fully enclosed cabs, 110 of them survived into British Railways ownership, the last of them being retired in 1956. They were superseded by the short-lived GWR 1600 Class, nominally a Hawksworth design, but in reality a straightforward update of the then 75-year-old design, with new boiler, bigger cab and bunker.

Feliformia stands in contrast to the other suborder of Carnivora, Caniformia (also Canoidea, \\"dog-like\\" carnivorans). The separation of the Carnivora into the broad groups of feliforms and caniforms is widely accepted, as is the definition of Feliformia and Caniformia as suborders (sometimes superfamilies). The classification of feliforms as part of the Feliformia suborder or under separate groupings continues to evolve. Systematic classifications dealing with only extant taxa include all feliforms into the Feliformia suborder, though variations exist in the definition and grouping of families and genera.Taxonomic references - extant species (1): Supporting descriptive information and pictures: Diversity Web (online) ‚Äì FeliformiaTaxonomic references - extant species (2): Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) Indeed, molecular phylogenies suggest that all extant Feliformia are monophyletic.Eizirik, E., W.J.

The extant families as reflected in the taxa chart at right and the discussions in this article reflect the most contemporary and well-supported views (as at the time of writing this article). Systematic classifications dealing with both extant and extinct taxa vary more widely.Fossil record data (with taxonomic references) extant and extinct species: The Paleaobiology DatabaseSupporting taxonomic references extant and extinct species: Systema Naturae 2000 / Classification - Suborder Feliformia Some separate the feliforms (extant and extinct) as: Aeluroidea (superfamily) and Feliformia (suborder). Others include all feliforms (extant, extinct and \\"possible ancestors\\") into the Feliformia suborder. Some studies suggest this inclusion of \\"possible ancestors\\" into Feliformia (or even Carnivora) may be spurious. The extinct (‚Ä†) families as reflected in the taxa chart are the least problematic in terms of their relationship with extant feliforms (with the most problematic being Nimravidae). Characteristics Feliformia skull showing double-chambered bullae All extant feliforms share a common attribute: their auditory bullae (bony capsules enclosing the middle and inner ear). This is a key diagnostic in classifying species as feliform versus caniform. In feliforms, the auditory bullae are double-chambered, composed of two bones joined by a septum. Caniforms have single-chambered or partially divided auditory bullae, composed of a single bone. This feature, however, is problematic for the classification of the extinct Nimravidae as feliforms. Nimravid fossils show ossified bullae with no septum, or no trace at all of the entire bulla. It is assumed that they had a cartilaginous housing of the ear mechanism. The specific characteristics of extant feliform bullae suggest a common ancestor, though one has not been identified in the fossil records. There are other characteristics that differentiate feliforms from caniforms and probably existed in their stem taxa. But, due to speciation, these do not apply unambiguously to all extant species. Feliforms tend to have shorter rostrums (snouts) than caniforms, fewer teeth, and more specialized carnassials. Feliforms tend to be more carnivorous and are generally ambush hunters. Caniforms tend more toward omnivorous and opportunity-based feeding. However, omnivorous feliforms also exist, particularly in the family Viverridae. Many feliforms have retractile or semi-retractile claws and many are arboreal or semi-arboreal. Feliforms also tend to be more digitigrade (walking on toes). In contrast, most caniforms are terrestrial and have non- retractile claws. Extant families A 1739 advert by Charles Benjamin Incledon featuring feliforms: the Mesopotamian lion from the vicinity of Bassorah, Cape lion, tiger from the East Indies, panther from Buenos Aires, Hyaena hyaena from West Africa, and leopard from Turkey, besides a \\"Man tyger\\" from Africa. Fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) Spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) Meerkat (Suricata suricatta) Binturong (Arctictis binturong) There are seven extant families, twelve subfamilies, 56 genera and 114 species in the Feliformia suborder. They range natively across all continents except Australia and Antarctica. Most species are arboreal or semi- arboreal ambush hunters. Target prey varies based on the species size and available food sources (with the larger species feeding mainly on small mammals and the smallest species feeding on insects or invertebrates). An overview of each family is provided here. For detailed taxa and descriptions of the species in each family, follow the links to other articles and external references. Family Eupleridae (the \\"Malagasy carnivorans\\") includes fossa, falanouc, Malagasy civet and Malagasy mongooses, all of which are restricted to the island of Madagascar. The eight species in the family exhibit significant variations in form. These differences initially led to the species in this family sharing common names with, and being placed in the different families of, apparently more similar species on the mainland (e.g. civets and mongoose). However, phylogenetic analysis of DNA provides strong evidence that all Malagasy carnivorans evolved from a single common ancestor that was a herpestid (Yoder et al. 2003).Anne D. Yoder and John J. Flynn 2003: Origin of Malagasy CarnivoraYoder, A., M. Burns, S. Zehr, T. Delefosse, G. Veron, S. Goodman, J. Flynn. 2003: Single origin of Malagasy Carnivora from an African ancestor ‚Äì Letters to Nature Phylogenetic analysis supports this view and places all of the Malagasy carnivorans in the family Eupleridae.Philippe Gaubert, W. Chris Wozencraft, Pedro Cordeiro-Estrela and G√©raldine Veron. 2005 - Mosaics of Convergences and Noise in Morphological Phylogenies: What's in a Viverrid-Like Carnivoran? The differences in form make it difficult to concisely summarise the species in this family. The range in size is as diverse as the range in form, with smaller species at less than 500 g (1 lb) and the largest species at up to 12 kg (26 lb). Some have retractile or semi- retractile claws (the fossa and the Malagasy civet) and others do not (the falanouc and Malagasy mongooses). They all tend to have slender bodies and pointed rostra (except the fossa, which has a blunt snout). Diet varies with size and form of the species and, like their mainland counterparts, ranges from small mammals, insects and invertebrates through to crustaceans and molluscs. Family Felidae (cats) are the most widespread of the \\"cat-like\\" carnivorans. There are 41 extant species, and all but a few have retractile claws. This family is represented on all continents except Australia (where domestic cats have been introduced) and the Antarctic. The species vary in size from the tiny black-footed cat (Felis nigripes) at only 2 kg (4.5 lb) to the tiger (Panthera tigris) at 300 kg (660 lb). Diet ranges from large to small mammals, birds and insects (depending on species size). Family Hyaenidae (hyenas and aardwolf) has four extant species and two subspecies. All show features of convergent evolution with canids, including non-retractile claws, long muzzles, and adaptations to running for long distances. They are extant in the Middle East, India and Africa. Hyenas are large, powerful animals, up to 80 kg (176 lb) and represent one of the most prolific large carnivorans on the planet. The aardwolf is much smaller at 27 kg (60 lb) and is a specialised feeder, eating mainly harvester termites. Family Herpestidae (the mongooses, kusimanses, meerkat, etc.) has 32 species. Previously, these were placed in the family Viverridae. However, Wilson and Reeder (1993) established the herpestids as morphologically and genetically distinct from viverrids. They are extant in Africa, Middle East and Asia. All have non-retractile claws. They are smaller as a family, ranging from 1 kg (2.2 lb) to 5 kg (11 lb), and typically have long, slender bodies and short legs. Diet varies based on species size and available food sources, ranging from small mammals, birds to reptiles, insects and crabs. Some species are omnivorous, including fruits and tubers in their diet. Family Nandiniidae (African palm civet) has only one species (Nandinia binotata), extant across sub-Saharan Africa. They have retractile claws and are slender-bodied, arboreal omnivores (with fruit making up much of their diet). They are relatively small with the larger males weighing up to 5 kg (11 lb). Family Prionodontidae (the Asiatic linsangs) has two extant species in one genus. They live in Southern-East Asia. All are arboreal hypercarnivorans. They are the closest living relatives of the family Felidae.Gaubert, P., & Veron, G. (2003). \\"Exhaustive sample set among Viverridae reveals the sister-group of felids: the linsangs as a case of extreme morphological convergence within Feliformia\\". Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series B, 270 270 (1532): 2523‚Äì30. Family Viverridae has 30 living species including binturong, large Indian civet, genets and oyans. They all have long bodies, short legs with retractile claws, and usually long tails. In weight, the species range from . Some occur in Southern Europe, but most in Africa and Asia. Their diet ranges from fruit and plants to insects, crustaceans and molluscs, and small mammals. Evolution Feliform evolutionary timeline In the Middle Palaeocene (60 million years ago), Miacoidea appears. Miacoids were a group of paraphyletic taxa believed to be basal to Carnivora. They had Carnivora-like carnassials but lacked fully ossified auditory bullae. Miacids were small arboreal carnivorans and, based on their size (roughly that of mongooses), they probably fed on insects, small mammals and birds. The miacoids are divided into two groups: the miacids, with a full complement of molars, and the viverravines with a reduced number of molars and more specialized carnassials. These dental differences resemble the difference between Caniforms (with more teeth) and Feliforms (with fewer teeth) but this may not mean evolutionary lineages. It was thought that Viverravidae was basal to the Feliforms. However, some studies suggest this is not the case. In the Middle Eocene (about 42 mya), the miacids started to branch into two distinct groups of the order Carnivora: the Feliforms and Caniforms. The miacid precursors to the extant Feliforms remained forest- dwelling, arboreal or semi-arboreal ambush hunters, while the Caniform precursors were more mobile, opportunistic hunters. While it is clear that the first Feliforms appeared at this time, there is no clear common ancestor of the Feliform families in the fossil records. As forest dwellers, the early Feliforms were subject to more rapid decomposition in the absence of sedimentary materials, resulting in large gaps in the fossil records. For more discussion on feliform evolution and the divergence from the caniforms, together with additional external references on this subject, see the articles on Carnivora, Miacoidea and Carnivoramorpha.

With the addition of Wright, the band became known as Spooky Tooth, releasing four albums between 1968 and 1970, before breaking up for the first time, and three more albums during their reformation and final breakup in the 1972-1974 period. The band's sound was considered to be particularly unique in that it involved two keyboard players, Harrison and Wright, whose singing style often involved alternating vocals, similar to the Righteous Brothers or Hall and Oates. Spooky Tooth first broke up in 1970, reformed in 1972 and broke up for a second time in 1974. Harrison commenced a solo career in 1971, which was anticipated with The Last Puff, the band's 1970 breakup album, billed as \\"Spooky Tooth, featuring Mike Harrison\\". Harrison released two solo albums in 1971 and 1972, followed by a third in 1975, subsequent to the band's final breakup in 1974. Harrison then discovered that the royalties from his solo albums were being applied, without his knowledge or consent, to debts allegedly owed by Spooky Tooth to Island Records. Following the 1975 release of his album Rainbow Rider, Harrison decided to leave the music industry entirely, and remained largely inactive from 1975 until 1997.David Ling, Archive: Lost in Time and Space; Teamrock.com, 23 May 2014. Retrieved 2017-12-06. The reason for his extended departure from music was primarily financial. Beyond a weekly stipend from Island Records, band members received no further benefits, including royalties. Instead, debts were accumulated, considered to be owed to the record company. Among other occupations, Harrison worked as a barman and drove meat and milk delivery trucks. Harrison developed a renewed interest in music as of the 1990s, resulting in the recording of three songs with original members Mike Kellie, Luther Grosvenor and Greg Ridley in 1997. Recording continued in 1998, resulting in the release of Cross Purpose in 1999, the first Spooky Tooth album in twenty-five years, following the 1974 release of The Mirror, in which Harrison had not participated. He had left the band in 1973, following the release of Witness. Cross Purpose was also the first Spooky Tooth album to feature four of the five original members since Spooky Two, released in 1969. In 1999, Harrison was also offered a regular monthly engagement with the Hamburg Blues Band. This led to the release of Touch in 2001. The album featured lyrics by Pete Brown, longtime collaborator with Jack Bruce, with music by the Hamburg Blues Band and vocals by Harrison. Harrison's return to music during the 1997-1999 period was followed by a 2004 reunion and tour with original Spooky Tooth members Gary Wright and Mike Kellie, which resulted in the release of the concert DVD Nomad Poets in 2007. In 2006, Harrison's fourth solo album, Late Starter, was released. Harrison, Wright and Kellie continued to perform as Spooky Tooth during 2008, after which Kellie departed. Harrison and Wright continued as Spooky Tooth during 2009. Harrison continued to perform on occasion after that time but died on 25 March 2018 in Carlisle at age 72 of undisclosed causes.For example, Harrison performed in Bremen in 2012, as part of a \\"Star Club Meets Beat Club\\" event: Event particulars: \\"Star-Club Meets Beat-Club\\", 19 October 2012; Radio Bremen.

T. Bhattathiripad or simply V. T., was an Indian social reformer, dramatist and an Indian independence activist. He was best known for his contributions in the reformation of the casteism and conservatism that existed in the Namboothiri community.Bhattathiripad, V. T. Encyclopaedia of Indian literature vol. 1, p. 479 He wrote a number of books which include a play, Adukkalayail Ninnu Arangathekku and his memoirs, Kanneerum Kinavum and many critics consider them as notable works in Malayalam literature. Kerala Sahitya Akademi honoured him with distinguished fellowship in 1976.  Biography  V. T. Bhattathiripad, n√©e Raman Bhattathiripad, was born on 26 March 1896 to Thuppan Bhattathiripad and Sridevi Andarjanam in Kaippilly Mana at Mezhathur on the banks of Bharathappuzha in south Malabar, presently in Palakkad district of the south Indian state of Kerala. He belonged to the family of Mezhathol Agnihothri on his father's side and had the lineage of Adi Sankara on his mother's side. After early education in the traditional way under Narayanan Othikkan, he studied under Pathakkara Manaikkal Meledam and Muthukurissi Mana Kunjunni Namboothirippad and on completion of vedic studies, he started working as a priest at shornur Mundamuka Sastha temple, owned by Kudalloor Mana. It was here, a 10 year old young girl from the neighbourhood taught him Malayalam alphabets and mathematics. He would study English soon after by joining Edakkuni Namboodiri School during which time he also ran a magazine by name, Vidyarthi. Indian independence movement was gaining popularity and Bhattathiripad participated in the Allahabad session of the Indian National Congress due to which he was expelled from his community. This prompted him to fight against casteism and he started campaigning for Brahmin widow remarriage and for raising funds for the campaign, he organized a march from Thrissur to Chandragiri River in 1931 which came to be known as Yachana Yathra (Begging March). The first marriage of Bhattathiripad did not last long and later he married Sreedevi Antharjanam of Ittyaparambath Illam. He died on 12 February 1982, at the age of 85.  Legacy  The principal contribution of Bhattathiripad was in the emancipation of Namboothiri women, especially his encouragement of widow marriages which was a taboo during those times. Along with M. R. Bhattathiripad, popularly known as MRB, he campaigned for widow remarriage by putting it in practice in his own household; he gave his sister in law. a widow, in marriage to MRB which was the first widow remarriage among Namboothiris in Kerala. Another widow marriage also followed soon which was the marriage of M. P. Bhattathiripad, better known as Premji, who was MRB's younger brother, to Arya, a 27 year old Namboothiri widow and Bhattathiripad, along with E. M. S. Namboothiripad, as well as the couple were excommunicated (Brashtu) by the community leaders. Bhattathiripad utilised his writing skills as a tool for social reforms and his writings contrasted the social changes that followed the Indian independence movement against the dormant state of Namboothiri community. The staging of his play, Adukkalayilninnu Arangathekku (From the Kitchen to the Stage), which featured Premji as one of the actors, in 1929 at Edakkunni, a village in Thrissur, was an important event in the social reform calendar of Kerala; the play highlighted the discriminatory rituals and practices prevalent in the Namboothiri community, especially the plight of Namboothiti women. The drama also marked a deviation in Malayalam theatre from historical plays to social dramas. Bhattathiripad's oeuvre consists of a play, a short story anthology, eleven essay compilations and three memoirs, of which Kanneerum Kinavum, the first of his three memoirs, narrates his life from 1896 until 1916 and is a documentation of the Namboothiri rituals and feudalism. The book was later translated into English by Sindhu V. Nair under the title, My Tears, My Dreams and was published by Oxford University Press.  Honours  Kerala Sahitya Akademi honoured him with distinguished fellowship in 1976. The Sreekrishnapuram VT Bhattathiripad College in Sreekrishnapuram, Palakkad district, is named after him.

The station is owned by NOVA Entertainment along with her sister station, Nova 100, and currently plays easy listening songs from the late-1950s/early-1960s to the present with a 55+ year span. History The station first named Vega began with a music and talk format, however it switched to a music format in 2006. In 2010, its format became 'Classic Rock' playing primarily rock artists from the '70s and '80s and targeted listeners 35‚Äì54, which would make its then competitors Gold 104.3 and Triple M. After a somewhat shaky start the station seemed to be growing slowly but consistently and then at the time had around 400,000 listeners (AC Nielsen Official Survey 6 in 2009). At the end of 2009, Vega moved to a model with no announcers outside of the Dicko and Dave morning show, with the result being a very high focus on music quantity post 9am. Alice Cooper started as the nights host on the station on 12 March 2010. On 12 March 2010 the Vega brand was dropped and the station was relaunched with new a format as 'Classic Rock 91.5' to counteract the 'classic hits' station Gold 104.3 and the contemporary active rock station Triple M. DMG Radio Australia announced the change as Vega's brand as the station has struggled towards the bottom of the ratings ladder in both Melbourne and Sydney. In building these new stations DMG needed a \\"simple, focused music concept that would appeal to the 35-54 audience.\\" according to CEO Cathy O'Connor.

He was a bay Thoroughbred gelding that was foaled in 1963 in Australia. In his native country, he won many important jumping races, particularly two-milers, including the Hiskens Steeplechase in 1969 and 1970. So well did he jump, he was nicknamed \\"The Black Kangaroo\\". However, Crisp is probably best remembered for his epic contest with Red Rum in the 1973 Grand National in England.  Career in England  Crisp made his British debut in a handicap race at Wincanton and was allotted . He was ridden by Richard Pitman, who would go on to ride Crisp for the majority of his racing life, including at the Grand National. Crisp won his debut race easily, by 15 lengths. His first major test was the 1971 Champion Chase at the Cheltenham Festival (now the Queen Mother Champion Chase). Once again, it was an easy victory. The following year, Crisp's owner decided to run him in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. But the two-miler struggled in the three-and-a-quarter mile race, finishing fifth. Despite the setback, they aimed Crisp at the following year's Grand National, one of the world's most famous steeplechases, at Aintree near Liverpool.  1973 Grand National  Before the off, Crisp was 9/1 joint-favourite with Red Rum to win the National.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/in_depth/2001/grand_national/1225397.stm However, by the time the runners had reached The Chair, Crisp, who was carrying the top weight of 12 stone (a weight that is now forbidden in the National), had already built up a significant lead and appeared unstoppable. For much of the initial stages, his closest challenger was Bill Shoemark on Grey Sombrero, but that horse fell (fatally) at The Chair, gifting Crisp an even greater lead which had grown to 20 lengths by the end of the first circuit. Jockey Pitman later recalled that at the Becher's Brook fence on the second circuit, fallen jockey David Nicholson shouted at him, \\"Richard, you're 33 lengths clear, kick on and you'll win!\\" At the same time, he heard the Tannoy commentator Michael O'Hehir declare, \\"And Red Rum is coming out of the pack, Brian Fletcher is kicking him hard!\\" At the 30th and final fence, Crisp was still 15 lengths ahead of Red Rum, who was ridden by Fletcher and given 10 stone, 5 lb by the handicapper. However, Crisp was beginning to tire badly on the 494-yard run-in, carrying 23 lb more than his nearest rival. Red Rum made up considerable ground, and two strides from the finishing post he pipped Crisp by three-quarters of a length to win his first of three Grand National titles. Even in defeat, Crisp had bettered the Grand National completion time by a full 20 seconds, a record that had stood for the 40 previous years. Despite Red Rum's unprecedented record in Grand Nationals and securing his place in British sporting history, the 1973 race is as much remembered for Crisp's run-in defeat as it was for Red Rum's narrow victory. Veteran commentator Jim McGrath called the battle between Red Rum and Crisp among the highlights of all Grand Nationals and said that Crisp was the unluckiest horse in the race's history.Jim McGrath's call of the National  After the National  Crisp ran three times in the season after his second-place effort in the 1973 National. After a warm up race over hurdles at Wincanton he won a two and a half mile chase at Newbury beating two mile champion chaser Royal Relief. Then, at Doncaster, he had a match race, at level weights, against his old foe Red Rum. With a twenty three pound weight turnaround from Aintree, Crisp won by eight lengths, but injured himself in doing so, and was retired for the season. Pitman, his jockey, said in a 2003 interview that following his retirement from racing, Crisp then hunted for the next eight seasons. He died out hunting, and was buried at the entrance of his then-owner's estate. A cherry tree was planted over the grave, which flowers at Grand National time.

Carter was executed in May 2000 for his part in the crime - and in his final statement took sole responsibility for the crime: \\"To the Davis family, I am sorry for all of the pain that I caused your family. It was me and me alone. Anthony Graves had nothing to do with it. I lied on him in court. ... Anthony Graves don't even know anything about it\\". Anthony Graves is also known as Death Row Exoneree 138. After spending 12 years on Death Row, Graves' conviction was overturned on March 3, 2006 by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals when, in a unanimous opinion, a three judge panel held that the state's case had hinged on Carter's perjured testimony, and concluded that the Prosecutor, Charles Sebesta, had intentionally withheld evidence that could have helped Graves; most notably that Carter had recanted right before he testified at Grave's August 1992 trial. Graves was held for an additional four years in solitary confinement in the Burleson County jail awaiting retrial until October 27, 2010, when he was released after all charges were dismissed by Burleson County Special Prosecutor Kelly Siegler, who concluded, \\"He's an innocent man. There is nothing that connects Anthony Graves to this crime.\\"Rogers, Brian \\"Prisoner ordered free from Texas' death row\\", The Houston Chronicle, Oct. 27, 2010. Graves was awarded $1.4 million by the State of Texas in June 2011 for his wrongful conviction. Dallas County * Randall Dale Adams was sentenced to death for of the 1976 murder of a police officer.

His 30 years of imprisonment is the longest of any exonerated inmate in Texas. Jefferson County Joe Elizondo was convicted in 1984, by a jury, of the 1983 aggravated sexual assault of his 10 yr-old step-son Robert Bienvenue. He was sentenced to life in prison and fined $10,000. In the fall of 1983, Robert and his 8 yr-old brother, Richard, told the Port Athur police, that they had been sexually abused by their mother, Mary Ann, 27, and their step-father, Joe, 49. At the time, the boys' father, Richard Bienvenue, Sr. had legal custody and the boys spent weekends with their mother and step- father. On September 23, 1983, the Elizondos were charged with sexually assaulting the boys. After they were arrested, the couple's one-year-old daughter was removed from their custody and was later adopted by another family. In August 1984, Joe Elizondo went on trial in Jefferson County Criminal District Court, on a single count of assaulting Robert Bienvenue. Robert told the jury that both he and his brother were forced to watch sexually explicit videos and to engage in oral sex with Joe, have oral contact with Mary Ann's breast and to have anal sex with both Joe and Mary. At times, Robert testified, another man and two women joined them. The jury was also shown a sexually explicit picture of a kangaroo that Robert had drawn at school, as well as a sexually suggestive note written to him by a female classmate. Robert's teacher confiscated these items, prompting interrogation by Robert's father and the police. During that questioning Robert detailed the alleged abuse. Robert's step-mother‚Äîthe wife of Richard Bienvenue, Sr.‚Äîtestified that the boys had told her of the abuse. Mary Ann Elizondo was found guilty of sexually assaulting Robert during a separate trial from Joe's in 1984, and she was sentenced to 20 yrs in prison. She pleaded no contest to a second charge and was sentenced to 35 years in prison, to be served concurrently with the 20-year term. After Joe and Mary Ann were convicted, Robert and Richard had no further contact with them. It wasn't until 1988, on Robert's 17th birthday, that he found a letter written by his mother, Mary Ann, and learned for the first time that Joe and Mary Ann were in prison. He then began writing to authorities, letting them know that he had lied when he accused his mother and step-father of sexual abuse. Mary Ann was released on parole in 1991. She then divorced Elizondo, and married someone else. While on parole, she was ordered into group therapy and told she had to admit to sexually abusing her two sons. When she refused, she was jailed for 6 months, before being released again on parole. A Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus was filed, and in August 1995, a hearing was finally held, concerning the recantations of both boys. Robert Bienvenue testified that his father threatened to spank him and his brother every day for the rest of their lives if they refused to testify against Elizondo and their mother. He said their father wanted to retaliate against his ex-wife for marrying Elizondo. Richard Bienvenue also testified. Though he denied that their father forced them to lie, he said the abuse never occurred. In 1995, the trial court found the recantations credible, set aside Joe Elizondo's conviction and ordered a new trial. In December 1996, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals upheld the trial court ruling. \\"Robert's recantation not only voids his trial testimony which implicated (Joe Elizondo), but constitutes affirmative evidence of (Joe Elizondo's) innocence,\\" the appeals court ruled. \\"We are convinced by clear and convincing evidence that no rational jury would convict him in light of the new evidence.\\" On June 23, 1997, Jefferson County District Attorney Paul McWilliams dismissed the charges against Joe Elizondo and he was released from prison that day. Mary Ann then sought to vacate her conviction. In November 2005, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, following the decision made in Joe Elizondo's case, vacated her conviction and the charges were dismissed. Sadly, Joe Elizondo, whose health was poor in prison, died in 2003. In October 2008, Mary Ann (Barbosa), who had filed a state compensation claim, received her compensation of $370,833. It is unknown as to whether charges were ever filed against Richard Bienvenue, Sr., for causing his sons to falsely accuse sexual abuse against Joe and Mary Ann Elizondo. Montgomery County Clarence Brandley was sentenced to death for the 1980 rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl. He was exonerated in 1990.

Williamson County Michael Morton was convicted of the 1986 murder of his wife, sentenced to life and spent 25 years in prison. Morton was exonerated in 2011 after DNA evidence proved another man had committed the murder. Also, other evidence turned up after the DNA tests showed that the prosecutor, Ken Anderson had withheld other evidence from the defense that would have excluded Morton from the crime. Morton's lawyers accused Anderson of failing to provide defense lawyers with this exculpatory evidence indicating that another man might have killed Morton's wife, including information that his 3-year-old son witnessed the murder and said his dad was not home at the time. In 2013 former prosecutor Ken Anderson who was now a judge was ordered to be arrested by a \\"court of inquiry\\" for failing to deliver all evidence to the defense attorneys as required by law. Anderson was forced to resign as judge and give up his Texas law license. On November 8, 2013, Anderson pleaded no contest to the charges as part of a plea bargain. He was sentenced to 10 days in jail.  Virginia  Culpeper County Earl Washington, Jr. was sentenced to death for a 1982 rape and murder. He was pardoned in 2000.  Wisconsin  Sherman Booth was convicted in January 1855 of violating the Fugitive Slave Act. The Wisconsin Supreme Court declared the Federal law unconstitutional and ordered Booth freed. In 1859, the U.S. Supreme Court overruled the Wisconsin court's decision, Ableman v. Booth, ordering Booth arrested and confined. Milwaukee County Lawrencia Bembenek was convicted of the 1981 murder of her husband's ex-wife. She won the right to a new trial in 1992. She pleaded no contest and her sentence was commuted to time served. She was trying to get her original conviction overturned and be exonerated. On November 20, 2010 she died at a hospice facility in Portland, Oregon from liver and kidney failure. Friends, family and supporters have been trying to get her a posthumous pardon.

The pistol entered production at the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant in 1973. The PSM is a blowback-operated handgun with a double-action trigger and slide-mounted manual safety without a slide stop. The grip panels are made from thin aluminum and new model with hard plastic. The weapon is made from steel. The PSM was designed around the newly developed 5.45√ó18mm cartridge, which was developed for the weapon by Precision Mechanical Engineering Central Research Institute. The cartridge is capable of penetrating 55 layers of kevlar at realistic engagement distances.http://warfare.be/db/catid/277/linkid/1836/title/psm/ This cartridge has a bottlenecked case and a spitzer-pointed jacketed bullet, providing performance superior to the .22 LR and .25 ACP (6.35√ó16mmSR Browning) rounds. The pistol was primarily intended for army high command staff. However, owing to its insignificant dimensions, especially small thickness (21 mm across the safety catch), it soon became popular with security (KGB) and law enforcement (militsiya) personnel. The PSM was also appreciated by higher echelon Communist Party functionaries.

She was built in 1958 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock company in Newport News, Virginia, United States, for the Grace Line, as the ocean liner Santa Rosa. Between 1992 and 1995, she sailed for Regency Cruises as Regent Rainbow and between 1997 and 2008, she sailed for Thomson Cruises (now Marella Cruises) as The Emerald. Before retiring in 2009, she was the last passenger ship built at a U.S. shipyard that was still in active service. Design and construction In 1956, the Grace Line ordered two new ships to replace the aging 1932-built sisters, and . Gibbs & Cox had designed the older two ships and would now design their successors. These modern ocean liners were built by Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock, Newport News, Virginia, USA and were among the last passenger ocean liners built entirely in the U.S. There was full air conditioning for passengers, and the ship was equipped with Gyrofin stabilisers. The interior was fireproofed with aluminum. Accommodations were spacious with all cabins facing outside and having private baths. Passenger ships of the day also handled cargo, and Santa Rosas two aft cargo holds had side doors and automatic conveyors to quickly move pallets on and off the ship, thus giving her a rapid turn-around at port. Santa Rosa was launched on August 28, 1957 and delivered on June 12, 1958. Career =1958‚Äì1971: Santa Rosa= The Emerald as Santa Rosa for Grace Line, c. 1960 The new Santa Rosa and entered service on the New York to South America and the Caribbean for Grace Line. Santa Rosa sailed on her maiden voyage from New York on June 26, 1958. Collision with SS Valchem In the early morning hours of March 26, 1959, Santa Rosa was returning to New York in heavy fog. She was 22 miles east of Atlantic City, N.J., when she collided with the tanker SS Valchem. No one was injured on the liner but one crewman from the tanker was killed, three were missing and their bodies never found, and 16 were injured. Santa Rosa‚Äôs bow punched a cavity extending halfway into the tanker and caused flooding of the lower engine room with resultant loss of power. Two boilers were also demolished. The funnel of the Valchem and adjacent vents were scooped off the tanker and carried onto Santa Rosa‚Äôs bow. Santa Rosa sustained heavy damage but was repaired and returned to service. =1971‚Äì1992: inactivity and modernisation= In 1970, the Grace Line merged with Prudential Lines to become Prudential-Grace Line. Santa Rosa sailed for another year but in 1971, passenger operations ceased and both she and the Santa Paula were laid up at Hampton Roads in Virginia and put up for sale. In 1975, Santa Rosa was obtained by the U.S. Department of Commerce and in 1976, she was sold to Vintero Corp. of New York City and renamed Samos Sky. She was intended to operate South American service once again, but this venture failed and she remained idle. In 1989, she was sold to Coral Cruise Lines, part of the Lelakis Group, and towed to Greece that December. In March 1990, Samos Sky arrived in Chalkis, Greece and was renamed Pacific Sun and then, later that year, Diamond Island. At the cost of $70 million, she was converted into a cruise ship; her superstructure was expanded, whilst her hull remained largely unaltered and she retained her original steam turbine engines, which were renovated with parts from the former Santa Paula. The work was finished in 1991. =1992‚Äì2009: Regent Rainbow and The Emerald= The Emerald, modernised, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, 1999 The modernised ship entered service under Regency Cruises as the popular Regent Rainbow in 1992, until Regency Cruises suffered extensive losses and was declared bankrupt in 1995. Regent Rainbow was placed under arrest that November. In December 1996, Regent Rainbow was sold to Louis Cruise Lines and renamed The Emerald. In 1997, she was chartered to Thomson Cruises to operate cruises for the British market. During her time with Thomson she became the company's most popular ship,Thomson Cruises brochures, c. 2000s and remained in service with them until October 2008, when she was dropped in favor of a larger, more modern and economical vessel. Hereafter, she saw limited further service for Louis until 2009, when the company announced that she was being laid up and most likely would not sail again.Brokeback PLATINUM Retirement The Emerald laid up in Eleusis, Greece, 2010 Following the departure of The Emerald from their service, Louis looked for other owners who would operate her for further use, since she met SOLAS 2010 regulations, but she remained laid up at Eleusis, Greece. In 2011, she was inspected by scrappers and in July 2012, she departed Greece for the scrapyard at Alang, India. She was scrapped under the shortened name Emerald.

Winchester commanded ACT Police, the community policing component of the AFP responsible for the Australian Capital Territory. Background Winchester, the son of a baker, worked as a miner near before joining the Australian Capital Territory Police Force in 1962, aged 29 years. The ACT Police and Commonwealth Police were merged in 1979 to form the Australian Federal Police (AFP). Death On 10 January 1989, at about 9:15 pm, Winchester was shot twice in the head with a Ruger 10/22 .22-calibre semi-automatic rifle fitted with a silencer and killed as he parked his car in the driveway of his neighbour‚Äôs premises in Deakin, Canberra. Winchester is Australia's most senior police officer to have been murdered. At the time of Winchester's murder, it was alleged that Winchester was corrupt, at any earlier period when it was said that he had handled bribes relating to a Canberra illegal casino. However, an audit of Winchester's financial affairs after his murder revealed nothing untoward. There were also allegations of 'Ndrangheta or Mafia involvement in his murder. The story of Winchester's murder was dramatised in Police Crop: The Winchester Conspiracy. Murder suspects =David Eastman= Prior to Winchester's murder, David Harold Eastman, a 44-year-old former Treasury Department economist, had made threats against Winchester's life. In 1995 Eastman was tried and convicted of the murder of Winchester and was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. During the 85-day trial, Eastman repeatedly sacked his legal team and eventually chose to represent himself. Eastman also abused the judge during his trial, and during later legal proceedings and appeals. Subsequent to his conviction, Eastman continuously appealed against his conviction, attempting to win a retrial on the basis that he was mentally unfit during his original trial. On 27 May 2009, Eastman was transferred from the Goulburn Correctional Centre in New South Wales to the ACT's Alexander Maconochie Centre to see out his sentence. A new inquiry relating to his conviction was announced in August 2012. In 2014, the inquiry, headed by Justice Brian Ross Martin, found there had been \\"a substantial miscarriage of justice\\", Eastman \\"did not receive a fair trial\\", the forensic evidence on which the conviction was based was \\"deeply flawed\\" and recommended the conviction be quashed. However Martin said he was \\"fairly certain\\" Eastman was guilty but \\"a nagging doubt remains\\". In 2016 it was reported that the ACT Government sought a retrial of Eastman over the murder of Winchester; and that the legal precedings had cost the ACT Government approximately 30 million. Meanwhile, Eastman lodged a civil claim against the ACT Government seeking compensation for wrongful imprisonment; and on 14 October 2019 Eastman was awarded 7.02 million in compensation. On 22 November 2018, Eastman was found not guilty of Winchester's murder after a lengthy re-trial. = Other suspects = In media reports following the quashing of Eastman's wrongful conviction and the subsequent retrial, it was reported that Winchester's death may be linked to connections associated with the 'Ndrangheta. Legacy The Winchester Police Centre in Belconnen in 2009. Following his murder the Winchester Police Centre, located in Benjamin Way, Belconnen, was established in 1994 as the headquarters for ACT Police.

R. Paterson, and M. C. Tate. \\"Structure and emplacement history of a multiple-center, cone-sheet‚Äìbearing ring complex: The Zarza Intrusive Complex, Baja California, Mexico.\\" Geological Society of America Bulletin 111.4 (1999): 607‚Äì19). The most commonly accepted method of ring dike formation is directly related to collapse calderas.Gudmundsson, Agust. \\"Formation of collapse calderas.\\" Geology 16.9 (1988): 808‚Äì10.  Caldera collapse and ring dike formation  Collapse calderas form due to the emptying of a magma chamber. Effusive eruptions that take place on the flanks of the associated volcano and a fissure system that direct magma away from the chamber are both mechanisms that can empty a magma chamber. As pressure in the magma chamber changes, an increase in tensile stresses create tension fractures at the surface of the volcano. The geometry of the top of the magma chamber dictate the location and magnitude of the tension fractures. In addition, it was found that the higher the radius to depth ratio of the magma chamber, the higher the probability of forming a collapse caldera. Once a tension threshold is approached, the roof of the magma chamber collapses in on itself, and is known as calderon subsistence.Blatt, Harvey, Robert Tracy, and Brent Owens. Petrology: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Macmillan, 2006. Tension fractures extend deeper in the profile and shear fractures or dip-slip faults form in a circular pattern around the caldera and are known as ring faults. Ring faults can be either vertical or steeply dipping faults. When they are inward dipping, they are known as normal faults and when they are outward dipping they are known as reverse faults. Ring faults then allow magma to rise through the fractures, forming a ring dike. These dikes can form as a direct result of collapse caldera formation, or through many injections around the ring fault over time.Gudmundsson, Agust, Joan Marti, and Elisenda Turon. \\"Stress fields generating ring faults in volcanoes.\\" Geophysical Research Letters 24.13 (1997): 1559‚Äì62 The magma of a ring dike is typically composed of acidic or intermediate composition due to the less dense melt that exists at the top of the magma chamber.O'keefe, John A., Paul D. Lowman, and Winifred S. Cameron. \\"Lunar Ring Dikes from Orbiter I.\\" Science 155.3758 (1967): 77‚Äì79.  Another mechanism of ring dike formation  It has been hypothesized that ring dikes may form when inclined sheets are captured within a ring fault system, which cause them to act as feeder dikes. The deflection of the sheets may be caused by the difference in material properties between and within the fault zone.  Implications  Whether or not a caldera ring fault dips inward or outward from the center of subsidence is a highly contentious issue. Ring faults near the surface are subject to erosion and mass wasting, changing the morphology of the caldera walls and making it difficult to tell the dip of the fault at formation.  Well known examples  = Ossipee ring-dike complex = About 36 ring dikes have been found in the Ossipee Mountains in New Hampshire. Caldera subsidence appears to be the mechanism leading to the formation of some of the ring dikes, but not all of them. The composition ranges from monzonite to quartz syenite.Modell, David. \\"Ring-Dike Complex of the Belknap Mountains. New Hampshire.\\" Geological Society of American Bulletin 47.12 (1936): 1885‚Äì1932. = Loch B√† ring dike = The Loch B√† ring dike, found on the Isle of Mull in Scotland, serves as a classic example of a well formed ring dike.Young, Davis A., Mind Over Magma: The Story of Igneous Petrology, Princeton University Press, 2003, pp. 341‚Äì42, This intrusive body forms an oval and its diameter can be measured at roughly 5.8 km by 8.5 km. The width of the dike varies throughout the profile, with a maximum width of approximately 300 meters. The composition varies from rhyolite to felsite, with phenocrysts of alkali feldspar and mafic minerals.Lockwood, John P. and Richard W.

He was one of the earliest missionaries in the region. Anderson was instrumental in the foundation of the South African town Griquatown. Early life Anderson was born in London, the eldest son of silk merchant William Anderson who was originally from Aberdeen. His mother was Catherine Turner who came from Devon. Like his parents, William was active in the Nonconformist movement. He was greatly influenced by the preaching of John Wesley and by the call of William Carey for the church to take the gospel to those who had never heard. Anderson was at the founding of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in September 1795 and he signed up for missionary service wherever the Society felt he could be of use. Due to family needs, his departure was delayed, but at the age of 30 he sailed for the Cape on 10 April 1800. Missionary work in Griquatown Anderson was one of four new recruits in the second group sent to the Cape by the LMS. He arrived in Cape Town in September 1800 and some months later, in 1801, moved beyond the borders of the Cape Colony and settled amongst the Griqua people north of the Orange River. He and a Dutch colleague Nicholas Kramer encouraged the Griqua, who had hitherto lived mainly by hunting, to settle at a place they called Klaarwater (meaning Clear Water) and plant gardens and grow wheat and other crops. Klaarwater, later renamed Griquatown, became a centre for agriculture (as a result of irrigation) and education and a thriving church was established. Anderson briefly returned to Cape Town where he met and married Johanna Maria Schonken, the daughter of descendants of early Dutch and French Huguenot settlers. Anderson and his wife became an integral part of the life of Griquatown. Johanna Anderson worked with the women in teaching hygiene and dress-making. Anderson befriended local chiefs such as Adam Kok and Barend Barends and baptised them into the Christian faith. Another younger leader during Anderson's time in Griquatown was Andries Waterboer who later would head the independent British Colony Griqualand. Whilst serving amongst the Griqua the Andersons also worked with the Khoikhoi and had considerable contact with the Tswana people. In 1813, Anderson together with LMS colleagues John Campbell and James Read, Griquatown colleague Lambert Jansz and Griqua chiefs Cornelius and Adam Kok, presented the Christian gospel for the first time to the Tswana king, Chief Mothibi. Fellow LMS missionaries Mary and Robert Moffat were in close contact with the Andersons during his time in Griquatown. Issues with Cape authorities For some years Anderson found himself wedged between the Griqua and the demands of the Cape government. He tried to keep good relations with the authorities in the Cape upon whom the community depended for supplies of gunpowder (necessary for hunting and protection) and for permits (which Anderson was allowed to issue) for those Griquas wishing to travel to the Cape or engage in trade with farmers. However, successive governors were not always favourable to the work of the missionaries and Anderson had often been criticized by the authorities in the Cape. In 1814 Governor John Cradock demanded that Anderson make sure that \\"all deserters criminals, slaves, (Hottentot or Bastard)\\"{quote taken from LMS reports in the archives of London University School of Oriental and African Studies} who had escaped north of the Orange River to Griquatown should be returned to the Cape Colony. In addition, the Governor demanded that Anderson arrange for twenty local youths, between the ages of 17 and 20, to join the Cape Hottentots Regiment. Anderson was outraged and found it extremely hard to explain these demands to the Griqua as few had any loyalty to the Cape which lay hundreds of miles to the south. When Anderson wrote to the Cape authorities to argue his case he received an even stronger reply from the new governor Lord Charles Somerset on 4 July 1814. Somerset wrote \\"...it is true that you may urge that your Institution is without the Colonial border and therefore not properly subject to the Government of this territory, but it is to be remarked that you have on every occasion received protection from the Colony...\\"{LMS archives SOAS, London} Somerset went on to threaten that all communication with the Cape would be broken if Anderson did not cooperate. It became clear to Anderson that the future of his work with the Griqua was under threat. He saw that threat as coming from his own countrymen and he began to doubt their claims to be civilised and Christians. Towards the end of 1814, Anderson himself went to Cape Town and met with Governor Lord Somerset to intercede on behalf of the Griqua and the community in Griquatown. An uneasy truce was the result, but the authorities in the Cape were no longer as favourable towards Anderson and the LMS in general. Problems for the missionaries in Griquatown Trouble surfaced in Griquatown when a European outlaw from justice in the Cape, Conrade Buys, who a large following amongst the Khoikhoi (and several wives in addition to his Dutch wife) came to the area north of the Orange River. Buys was a gifted orator who was passionately opposed to the British and played on the dissatisfaction of the Griqua people. He asked the local people why they should worry about Anderson and their traditional chiefs when they could be free and when it was easier and more profitable to trade \\"illegally\\" with farmers in the remote border areas of the Cape Colony. He asked them why they should bother to get a letter or pass from Anderson. By 1816 a group of disaffected Griqua, known collectively as the Hartenaars, moved further east to the Harts River. A few years later many Hartenaars did return to Griquatown but the conflict between some of their leaders and also some of their own fellow Griqua took much longer to heal. Anderson was overburdened by his missionary responsibilities and coping with the political tensions over the Hartenaars. It was an issue Robert Moffat clearly pointed out; there had to be \\"a clear division between the work of the Church and the running of what amounted to the emerging Griqua state.\\" Unknown to Anderson, Moffat and John Campbell, James Read was complicating the local situation by spending time with certain Griqua leaders and undermining Anderson's reputation. Tensions increased following a major blow to the reputation and work of the LMS in southern Africa when in 1817 it was discovered that Read had committed adultery. By early in 1820, William and Johanna Anderson felt they needed to leave Griquatown to avoid being a stumbling block for the Church and community moving forward. It was a painful parting and many Griqua were sad to see their pastor and leader leave after almost 20 years amongst them. Subsequent events proved the problems of Griquatown could not be solved simply by the departure of the Andersons. In terms of organization and governance, there had to be a separation between Church and \\"state\\" even if the community at large and her leaders held onto their Christian faith and values. Life after Griquatown William and Johanna Anderson relocated to the southern Cape. They had a brief tenure on an LMS station in Zuurbraak and then took over the work in Pacaltsdorp, near George. There followed a further 30 years of extremely fruitful service amongst the Khoikhoi and mixed race people (later called Cape Coloureds) in a scenic part of South Africa. Pacaltsdorp became one of the most successful stations of the LMS. On 19 June 1825 the great stone church in Pacaltsdorp was officially opened. It is now a provincial heritage site. Johanna Anderson died in Pacaltsdorp in 1848 and William Anderson died four years later in 1852. Their children were active both in Pacaltsdorp and other centres with youngest son Bartholemew Ebenezer becoming a leading pastor in the Congregational Church in Oudtshoorn. A multi-racial church, it was one of the largest at the time in South Africa with some 2000 members.

It currently has around 1450 students, including about 200 in the sixth form. The School was formed under the name of Ullswater High School in 1980, when Tynefield (girls) and Ullswater (boys) secondary modern schools merged. The school still has two sets of all facilities (two halls, two gyms, two kitchens) and there is still the 'mixed yard' in the middle of the school. This was a playground where boys and girls were allowed to 'mix' at breaks. The two main blocks of the school consist of the former schools, now renamed Cumberland block and Westmorland block, named after the historic counties Cumberland and Westmorland that became Cumbria in 1974. Along with Eamont Block for students with learning disabilities, Eden Block, Resources and Rural Science blocks The character of the school comes from two main factors. The first is its enormous catchment area, the largest in England. The second is the existence of its neighbour and great rival, Queen Elizabeth Grammar School ('QEGS'). QEGS is a selective school. Mr David Robinson served as headmaster until April 2004, then the school was led by Mr Stewart Gimber as the head teacher. Ullswater had a ‚Äògood‚Äô inspection in 2006, but in 2009, it was given a ‚Äònotice to improve‚Äô by Ofsted. In September 2009, Mr Nigel Pattinson took over the role as head teacher. Ullswater is a Business and Enterprise College, and has many links with the local community through enterprise projects. The school also has a large adult or further education centre. In January 2011, construction of a new training centre began, and was completed in September 2011. The new \\"Applied Learning Centre\\" was opened on 29 November 2011, by The Duke of Gloucester. In May 2012, controversy arose as Nigel Pattinson, the headmaster, was given a pay rise at a time when the school was making staff redundant, and was short of money. The governors defended their actions saying that the rise was due to the school meeting the targets that they had set for Mr Pattinson. However, in the Cumberland & Westmorland Herald, one reader pointed out that if Mr Pattinson had met the targets then he had obviously done so with the assistance of other staff.

Eckhardt holds the known all-time professional baseball record for batting average, counting both major and minor league stats: .365. (Ty Cobb holds the major league record, .366, but Cobb's minor league average of .304 lowers his total professional- ball average to .364, second behind Eckhardt. Ike Boone holds the minor league record, .370, but his major league average of .321 also lowers his total professional-ball average to .364 (just behind Cobb if their averages are expanded to further digits). Eckhardt hit .192 in the major leagues, but in just 52 at bats, so his known minor league average of .366 was lowered just one point.) In spite of his outstanding ability to hit for average, Eckhardt ‚Äì a poor fielder who lacked much home run power ‚Äì was never able to establish himself in the major leagues. He spent a few years as a coach and assistant professor at West Texas State Teachers College (now West Texas A&M; University), so he was already 26 when he started seriously playing minor league ball, which is older than the average age of major league debuts. He was invited to spring training by the Detroit Tigers in 1929, 1930, and 1931, but he didn't make the team. He played in spring training for the Boston Braves 1932, and did go north with the Braves, but was sent back to the minors after eight at bats as a pinch hitter. The next year, 1933, he hit .414 for the San Francisco Missions, which is still the PCL (Pacific Coast League) record. In 1935, he again won the PCL batting title, edging out 20-year-old Joe DiMaggio, .399 to .398. This finally earned him a slot on a major league club, the 1936 Brooklyn Dodgers, with a chance to win a job as a regular. But Eckhardt was 36 years old by then, was still a poor fielder with little power, and in ten starts hit just .182 in 44 at bats. He was sent back to the minors, never to return. Eckhardt also played halfback and quarterback for the Texas Longhorns, and professionally as a halfback in 11 games for the New York Giants of the National Football League.

The largest part of his professional career was spent as a Professor at Boston University where he established the Department of Astronomy and developed a teaching and research observatory. The teaching Observatory at Boston University is named in his memory. Judson Coit was raised on a central New York farm and attended a rural district school. His education included sufficient mathematics to enter college, as well as one term of Latin. At age 17, he was working on a farm during the summer, attending Faley Seminary in Fulton, NY during fall and spring, and teaching school during the winter. In 1871, at age 22, he entered Syracuse University during its first full year of operation. His undergraduate studies included particular attention to Greek, which he intended to teach, and to mathematics, because he liked the subject and admired the men who taught it. He became a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, the Glee Club, and played varsity baseball.The 1911 Hub, Junior Annual of the Boston University College of Liberal Arts, published 1910, pg 6 After graduation with a BA degree, Judson Coit served as Professor of Mathematics at Dickenson Seminary in Williamsport, Pa., for four years (1875-1879) and obtained a Master's Degree from Syracuse University in 1878.

A sugar mill in Modinagar marked the beginning of the Modi Group conglomerate, which later diversified into varied fields. GM Modi established schools and colleges at his birthplace, Mahendragarh, in Patiala and in Modinagar. He also contributed in the field of higher education by giving grants to established institutions such as Banaras Hindu University, and different colleges in Meerut and other places. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India in 1968. He is the grandfather of Lalit Modi, the founder of the Indian Premier League (IPL). Early life Gujarmal Modi was born as Ram Prasad Modi on 9 August 1902, in Mahendragarh (now in Haryana state). He was the second child of his father, Multani Mal Modi, and the only child of his mother, Chandi Devi, who was Multani Mal's second wife. Chandi Devi died of sepsis only six days after the birth of Gujarmal. Multani Mal then married a third time, and it was his step-mother, Gujri Devi, who reared Gujarmal. All his life, Gujarmal was to share a relationship of great affection and attachment with his step-mother. He gave up his real name (Ram Prasad) in favour of the name \\"Gujarmal,\\" which he selected in honour of his step-mother. During his time studying in the tenth standard, Gujarmal neglected to pay his examination fees, which resulted in the loss of an academic year. This incident led to his father inducting Gujarmal into the family business at a young age while simultaneously being home-schooled.  Business career  In 1932, after a decade during which he grappled with personal issues and depression, Modi revived both his spirit and his business. After his second marriage that year, Modi became enthused and motivated for carrying on his business, because the sense of futility and depression left him when his wife became pregnant. Modi fulfilled his long-standing desire of expanding the family business to new sectors and territories. In 1932, with an amount of Rs. 400/-, he left for Delhi on the lookout for viable ventures. The village of Begumabad was finally selected as the site of his first independent venture‚Äî a sugar mill. After initial difficulties in managing the sugar mill, Gujarmal successfully managed to turn things around to make his debut venture into a profitable entity. One of Gujarmal‚Äôs major successes was the toilet soap factory, which began operations in 1941. Gujarmal with the help of a Bengali gentleman figured out a way to produce toilet soap without the use of tallow‚Äî the substance used to make the soap cake dry and hard. Instead, his toilet soap factory used vanaspati, from his vanaspati manufacturing unit, which proved to be a huge success.

Modi's personal life had its fair share of ups and downs. As was customary in those days, he was married aged twelve, in 1914, to a girl the same age as him. He and his wife therefore grew up together and were very attached to each other. Six years after their wedding, the couple became the parents of a child, but the newborn died within a few hours. Little did the family realize at that time that they were fated to relive this misery ten times over, for this heartbreaking event was to be tragically repeated that many times in as many years. During the years 1920-31, Modi's wife bore as many as ten children, but every single child died either in childbirth or in infancy. Medical care in semi-rural Begumabad was abysmal, and the Modi family was not yet seriously wealthy. Modi's wife also began keeping ill constantly, but it is not known whether this was a cause or a consequence of the loss of children. It became clear that further attempt at child-bearing would be both futile and dangerous to the health of the mother. Modi's wife despaired of motherhood, and joined family elders in counseling him to bring another wife home, saying that she would rejoice in his children, for they would be in some sense her own children. Gujar Mal finally acceded to the entreaties of his father and first wife. Multani Mal set about searching for another suitable match, and on 19 June 1932, Gujar Mal was married to Dayawati Modi, a lady of his own Marwadi community hailing from Etah district of Uttar Pradesh. Dayawati, the daughter of Chheda Lal, a tradesman of Etah, was seventeen years old; Gujar Mal was thirty. The two co-wives lived harmoniously together in the same household, because Gujar Mal began treating his first wife as a family elder. Dayawati was to become the mother of eleven healthy children, five sons and six daughters. Several daughters were born before the birth of K K Modi, their eldest son, in 1940. Their other sons are Vinay Kumar, Satish Kumar, Bhupendra Kumar aka Dr.M and Umesh Kumar. Personality Gujarmal was a staunch patriot and this was amply visible during his youth. In 1926, he was insulted on the basis of his nationality by an Englishman working in India by the name of Mr. Turner, after the young Modi outbid him during a public auction. An incensed Modi subjected the Englishman to a beating, which later resulted in a telling off by the Maharaja of Patiala; but earned him the respect of the public. In 1945, after the end of the Second World War, the British government wanted to confer a knighthood on Gujarmal for the exemplary service provided by his companies during the War. Gujarmal instead requested the British to confer on him an Indian title. The British duly complied and decided to honour him with the title of Raja Bahadur, which was the catalyst behind the renaming of Begumabad to Modinagar. In 1946, the interim government of India decided to stop conferring titles and the decision to honour Gujarmal was deferred. Modi Group Lalit Modi. The Modi Group split in 1989, and the business was divided between the five sons of Gujarmal Modi, including Krishan Kumar Modi, VK Modi, SK Modi, B. K. Modi and UK Modi and the three sons of his step brother Kedar Nath Modi. Krishan Kumar Modi, Gujarmal Modi's eldest son, owns Godfrey Phillips, the tobacco manufacturing company. His brother K. N. Modi, died in 2005, at the age of 84. His son M.K. Modi is the head of Modipon Fibre, of the K.N. Modi Group, while his other son Y.K. Modi was FICCI president for many years. Since the division, the Modi Group companies have underperformed and failed to match the successes achieved by the late Gujarmal Modi. His son Krishan Kumar Modi and former chairman of Modi Group passed away at the age of 79 on 2 November 2019. In April 2010, Krishan Kumar Modi, had revealed that his eldest son Lalit Modi will succeed him as the helm of Modi Group's flagship business Godfrey Phillips India (GPI). Awards and honours Modi had a telling impact on Indian commerce and industry and that is amply displayed by the awards and honours bestowed upon him. In 1968, he was decorated with the Padma Bhushan‚Äî the third-highest civilian award in India. The same year, he also became the President of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). Gujarmal held positions in various committees and business-governance bodies during his career. *1960: Member of the Central Customs and Excise Advisory Committee *1960: Vice-President of the Reserve Bank of Northern India *1964: Member of the National Productivity Council *1967: Member of the Export and Import Advisory Council & Indian Exports Organisation *1968: Chairman of the International Arbitration Council Philanthropic activities GM Modi established various institutions in the fields of education, science, medicine and women‚Äôs welfare to uplift the country‚Äôs downtrodden and encourage competence-development in the youth. The Gujarmal Modi Innovative Science and Technology Award was instituted in 1988 in honour of his numerous philanthropic contributions to the field.

Kawauchi often thinks about new ways to see her photographs, allowing her to continue to find new meaning and significance in her work. There is little known about her personal life and family, but through her photo book \\"Cui Cui\\" she portrays the memories of her family, which she has said to have been shooting for over a decade. The photos in said book captures all the ordinaries and emotions of life, ranging from the happiness of childbirth to the heartbreak of death. At age 19, she began making prints of her first black-and-white photographs, and it wasn't until five years later that she started printing color photographs. After experimenting with different cameras, she decided to stay with the Rolleiflex, which she still uses. In 2001, three of her photo books were published: Hanako (a Japanese girl's name), Utatane (\\"catnap\\"), and Hanabi (\\"fireworks\\").

Her photographs are mostly in 6√ó6 format. However, upon being invited to the Brighton Photo Biennial in 2010, Kawauchi first photographed digitally and began taking photos that were not square. Kawauchi also composes haiku poems. She lived for many years in Tokyo and in 2018 moved to the countryside on the outskirts of the city.  Style  Since she began her photographic career, Kawauchi's photographs contained a unique aesthetic and mood, capturing intimate, poetic, and beautiful moments of the world around her. They often have brilliant and radiant light that give them a dream-like quality. The sublimity of her photographs are further enhanced by her use of soft colors as well as her awareness for the beauty in even the most average moments. There is not one specific theme or concept that Kawauchi chooses to explore with her image creation; rather, she does it spontaneously, observing and reacting to everything that is around her before doing and sort of editing. She focuses on just shooting, photographing everything that attracts her eyes before looking back and thinking about why she was interesting in those subjects. Another subject that she explored in her book, Ametsuchi, was the practice of religious ceremonies and rituals that hinted at an earthly cycle involving the concepts of time and impermanence. In the book, she depicts Japan's Mount Aso, a sacred site for a Shinto ritual called yakihata, and its volcanic landscape. The ritual is a long-standing tradition dating back about 1,300 years in which farmland is burned yearly to maintain its sustainability for new crops as opposed to using chemicals, and the communities at Aso are among the few that continue this tradition. Ironically, witnessing essentially the rebirth of farmland take place, Kawauchi claims that she burned away her old self and was reborn herself. In her book Halo, she continues to explore that theme with different rituals at other locations. She traveled to Izumo, Japan to witness a ritual that involves the lighting of sacred flames to welcome the gods. She also went to the Hebei province of China to see new year celebrations, including a 500 year old tradition of throwing molten iron at the city walls to make their own fireworks.

Though Albert's authorship of this text has been debated by such scholars as Pierre Mandonnet and, more recently, Nicholas Weill-Parot, some scholars recognized it as a genuinely Albertine work (Mandonnet, 1910; Weill-Parot, 2002; Hendrix, 2010; Thorndike, 1923‚Äì28; Lemay, N.D.). Background Albert wrote the Speculum in response to the debate concerning medieval astrology. It came to a head with the Condemnations of 1277 at the University of Paris, with Bishop Stephen Tempier's list of 219 propositions that were forbidden to be believed, or indeed even to be discussed (Bianchi, 1999). Bishop Tempier and his allies were concerned that much of the Aristotelian knowledge being integrated into European universities represented a challenge to Christianity. For Tempier, astrology was one of the most problematic areas of knowledge, motivating a sizable number of the condemnations. In particular, he thought that any form of knowledge promising to allow one to predict the future would negate humankind's free will. Albert, however, built upon an idea originally expressed by Ptolemy in the 2nd century, and summed up by the 9th century Arabic scientist Albumasar, as: \\"The wise man will dominate the stars,\\" to construct an argument that astrology perfected, rather than negated free will (Zambelli, 1992; Lemay, 1962). Albert argued that celestial influence began with God before being transmitted through each of the nine upper spheres of creation, down to the tenth sphere of the sublunar realm, where we all live our lives. As this influence is passed from the stars to each one of the planets and then on to the Earth and its creatures, it picks up accretions that were not part of God's original intent (Hendrix, 2007). Therefore, terrestrial creatures did not receive divine influence in its pure form, but with various changes imparted by the heavenly bodies. These accretions meant that the force of celestial influence lacked God's purity and His ability to enforce change. Furthermore, the celestial bodies through their corporeal nature caused this flow of influence, which is perceived as visible light, to function as a bodily, rather than a spiritual, force (Hendrix, 2007). Because of this quasi-corporeal status, Albert maintained that the transmitted influence could affect the body, but not the soul. This influence would result in corporeal impulses‚Äîsuch as lust or gluttonous desire‚Äîthat influenced the soul only indirectly, through the body. Because of this, the person receiving the influence could choose to override it through an act of will. But since most people are perfectly content to be moved along by their physical impulses, astrology would be able to accurately predict future actions in almost every case. However, a knowledge of astrology helps one to resist the influences that celestial bodies impart, therefore assisting one in resisting these bodily impulses. Thus, in Albert's argument, astrology perfects, rather than negates, free will. Influence The Speculum became central to the debate about astrology in the medieval, Renaissance, and early-modern periods, with its status as a source not declining until the early seventeenth century (Hendrix, 2007). For more than a dozen generations those who wrote upon astrology almost invariably cited the Speculum or used its arguments, whether to defend celestial divination, such as the 13th century physician Peter d'Abano did, or to attack it as did the 15th century humanist Pico della Mirandola.

Life He was the only son of Duke Otto I, Duke of Merania and his wife Beatrice, daughter of the Hohenstaufen count Otto I of Burgundy. He succeeded his mother as Count Palatine of Burgundy on her death in 1231, and his father as Duke of Andechs and Merania on his death in 1234. In the same year, he married Elizabeth, daughter of Count Albert IV of Tyrol. The marriage remained childless. Still a minor, he remained under the tutelage of his Andechs relative Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg until 1236. When he came of age, he left the administration of the County of Burgundy (Franche-Comt√©) to King Theobald I of Navarre to engage in the struggle around his Bavarian possessions against the ducal House of Wittelsbach. He lost his position as a Vogt of Tegernsee Abbey as well as the ancestral seat in Andechs, but retained the possession of Innsbruck, which he elevated to a town in 1239 and put under the administration of his father-in-law Count Albert of Tyrol. In 1242 he gave Franche-Comt√© in pawn to Duke Hugh IV of Burgundy. In his later years, Otto concentrated on his family's estates in Franconia. In the fierce controversy between the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II and Pope Innocent IV, he sided with his feudal lord, the Bishop of Bamberg, which earned him an Imperial ban and a large-scale loss of his possessions. Like his Andechs ancestors, he benefitted the Cistercian abbey in Langheim, Franconia, where he was buried upon his death in 1248. He also had vested neighbouring Lichtenfels with city rights in 1231. Heirless, he was succeeded in Burgundy by his sister Adelaide and her husband Count Hugh of Chalon, while the now empty title of a Duke of Merania finally expired. With the death of Otto's uncle Patriarch Berthold of Aquileia in 1251, the House of Andechs became extinct.

The island is occupied by a number of buildings and architectural structures and is especially well known for its gardens. In the past it was known as Isola di San Vittore and later as Isola Maggiore. History The available historical sources indicate that in the middle of the ninth century the island had a church, a cemetery (whose existence is recalled by the current garden‚Äôs so- called scala dei morti, or ‚ÄúStaircase of the Dead‚Äù). It is known for certain that olives were cultivated here; the produce may have been employed for sacred purposes. In 1501 Lancillotto Borromeo, one of the five children of Giovanni III Borromeo and Cleofe Pio di Carpi, introduced the cultivation of citrus fruit to the island, the plants being brought from Liguria, along with a gardener (or hortolano) to tend them. Lancillotto began the construction of the family residence on the island, which in the 1580s was extended in the Renaissance style by Renato I Borromeo. Monuments The Palazzo Borromeo was built in the sixteenth century on the remains of the early church, cemetery and perhaps castle of San Vittore (named after the martyr Victor Maurus). The palace is surrounded by impressive gardens, the Giardini Botanici dell'Isola Madre, covering an area of eight hectares whose construction all‚ÄôInglese (in the English style) began in the late eighteenth century on the site of a citrus orchard. Particularly prized is the scala dei morti, or staircase of the dead, which in recent decades has been embellished with an important collection of Wisterias. The family chapel of 1858 is also noteworthy; by contrast to that of Isola Bella, it contains no tombs or funerary monuments.

Their parent tribe was the Rabi'a, and they thus traced their descent to the Adnanites. The Taghlib were among the most powerful and cohesive nomadic tribes of the pre-Islamic era and were known for their bitter wars with their kinsmen from the Banu Bakr, as well as their struggles with the Lakhmid kings of al-Hira in Iraq. The tribe embraced Monophysite Christianity and remained largely Christian long after the advent of Islam in the mid-7th century. After early opposition to the Muslims, the Taghlib eventually secured for themselves an important place in Umayyad politics. They allied with the Umayyads and engaged in numerous battles with the rebellious Qaysi tribes during the Qays‚ÄìYaman feuding in the late 7th century. During Abbasid rule, some individuals from the tribe embraced Islam and were given governorships in parts of the Caliphate. By the mid-9th century, much of the Taghlib converted to Islam, partly as a result of the persuasion of the Taghlibi governor of Diyar Rabi'a and founder of al-Rahba, Malik ibn Tawk. Several Taghlibi tribesmen were appointed governors of Diyar Rabi'a and Mosul by the Abbasids. In the early 10th century, a Taghlibi family, the Hamdanids, secured the governorships of these regions, and in the 930s, the Hamdanid leader Nasir al-Dawla formed an autonomous emirate out of Mosul and Jazira. Likewise, in 945, his brother, Sayf al-Dawla, created a northern Syrian emirate based in Aleppo. The Hamdanids ruled both of these emirates until their political demise in 1002. The Taghlib as a tribe, however, had disappeared from the historical record during the early Hamdanid period. Origins The Banu Taghlib were originally a Bedouin (nomadic Arab) tribe that inhabited the Najd.Lecker 2000, pp. 89‚Äì90. The tribe was named after its progenitor Taghlib ibn Wa'il, also known as Dithar ibn Wa'il.Lecker 2000, p. 89. The tribe belonged to the Rabi'a confederation and thus traced its descent to the Nizar branch of the Adnanites. Their full genealogy is as follows: Taghlib/DithƒÅr ibn WƒÅ æil ibn Qasit ibn Hinb ibn Af·π£ƒÅ ibn Du ømƒ´ ibn Jadƒ´la ibn Asad ibn Rabƒ´ øa ibn NizƒÅr ibn Ma øadd ibn AdnƒÅn. Their rival and brother tribe was the Banu Bakr ibn Wa'il. Sub-groups Information about the Taghlib's branches were in large part based on the records of the pre-Islamic Taghlibi genealogist al-Akhzar ibn Suhayma.Lecker 2000, p. 90. Taghlib ibn Wa'il had three sons, Ghanm, Imran and al-Aws.Lecker 2000, p. 91 However, in Arab genealogical literature, only the descendants of Ghanm ibn Taghlib are discussed extensively. From Ghanm came the al-Araqim, which referred to the descendants of six sons of Bakr ibn Hubayb ibn Amr ibn Ghanm, all of whom had eyes that resembled those of arƒÅqim (speckled snakes; sing. al-ArqƒÅm). The al-Araqim were the most important group of the Taghlib and nearly all of the genealogical history of the Taghlib centers around them. The six divisions of the al-Araqim were the Jusham (the largest), Malik (second largest), Amr, Tha'laba, al-Harith and Mu'awiya. Because of their size and strength, the Jusham and Malik were collectively referred to as al-RawkƒÅn, which translated as \\"the two horns\\" or \\"the two numerous and strong companies\\". The smaller Amr division of the al-Araqim was known as al-NakhƒÅbiqa. From the Jusham division came the Zuhayr branch, from which several large sub-tribes descended, including the Attab,Utba,Itban, Awf and Ka'b lines; all of these lines were founded by the eponymous sons of Sa'd ibn Zuhayr ibn Jusham. The Attab, Utba and Itban sub-tribes formed the al-Utab grouping, while the Awf and Ka'b sub-tribes formed the Banu al-Awhad. Another leading Zuhayri sub-tribe was the al-Harith, whose eponymous founder was a son of Murra ibn Zuhayr. The Malik division also bore numerous tribal groupings, including al-Lahazim (descendants of Awf ibn Malik), al-Abna' (descendants of Rabi'a, A'idh and Imru' al-Qays, all sons of Taym ibn Usama ibn Malik), al- Qu'ur (descendants of Malik's sons Malik and al-Harith) and Rish al-Hubara (descendants of Qu'ayn ibn Malik). The Hamdanid dynasty traced its descent to the Malik division via their ancestor Adi ibn Usama ibn Malik.Lecker 2000, p. 93. History =Pre-Islamic era= In the pre-Islamic era (pre-630s), the Taghlib were among the strongest and largest Bedouin tribes in Arabia. Their high degree of tribal solidarity was reflected in the large formations they organized into during battle. The tribe was involved in several major battles during this period. As early as the 4th century CE, the Taghlib were within the sphere of influence of the Persian Sasanian Empire and their Arab clients, the Lakhmid kings of al-Hira. It is mentioned during this time that the Sasanian king Shapur II sent Taghlibi captives to live in Darin and al-Khatt, both in the region of Bahrayn (eastern Arabia). In the late 5th century, the Taghlibi chieftain Kulayb ibn Rabi'a, from the al-Harith ibn Murra line of the Zuhayr branch, was murdered by his brother-in-law, Jassas ibn Murra al- Shaybani of the Banu Bakr.Levi Della Vida, p. 362. This precipitated a long conflict, known as the Basus War, between the Taghlib and Bakr. Kulayb's brother Muhalhil assumed leadership of the Taghlib, but quit his position after the Taghlib's decisive defeat at the battle of Yawm al-Tahaluq, after which the bulk of the Taghlib fled Najd for the Lower Euphrates region. There, they lived alongside the Namir ibn Qasit tribe, the Taghlib's paternal kinsmen. A section of the Taghlib had already lived in the Lower Euphrates prior to the tribe's mass exodus. Concurrent with the Basus War was the rise of the Kindite Kingdom in central and northern Arabia. Both the Taghlib and the Bakr became subjects of the Kingdom during the reign of al-Harith ibn Amr ibn Hujr (early 6th century). After al-Harith's death (post 530), his sons Shurahbil and Salama contested the throne. The Taghlib and Namir backed Salama against the Bakr who backed Shurahbil. Al-Saffah, a Taghlibi warrior from the Malik division, was commander of Salama's cavalry, while another Taghlibi, Usum ibn al-Nu'man, slew Shurahbil in battle. The Basus War ended in the mid-6th century when the Taghlib and Bakr signed a peace treaty at the Dhu al- Majaz market near Mecca. The Taghlib migrated further north along the Euphrates to Upper Mesopotamia (known to the Arabs as the \\"Jazira\\") after their chieftain Amr ibn Kulthum of the Jusham division assassinated the Lakhmid king Amr ibn al-Hind in 568. As late as the 8th century, Taghlibi tribesmen glorified Amr ibn Kulthum as among the most preeminent Arabs of the pre-Islamic era, and noted his poetic skills, his struggle against the kings of al-Hira and his feats in the conflict with the Bakr. In 605, the Taghlib and Bakr fought on opposing sides in the Battle of Dhi Qar, with the Taghlib backing the Sasanians against the Bakr. =Early Muslim period= Jazira and its provinces, during the Islamic era. The Jazira was the abode of the Banu Taghlib from the late 6th century, and during the Abbasid era, several Taghlibi tribesmen governed its provinces and cities. The Taghlibi Hamdanid dynasty ruled much of Jazira between the mid-10th century and the start of the 11th century. The Taghlib's political influence receded considerably during the advent of Islam in the mid-7th century. Due to their distance from Mecca and Medina, the two cities that played the central role in Islam's development, the Taghlib were not involved in Islamic affairs in the prophet Muhammad's time. During the Ridda Wars (632‚Äì633) between the Muslims and the apostate Arab tribes, the Taghlib fought alongside the latter. Sections of the Taghlib, particularly the Utba line of the Zuhayr branch, fought the Muslim armies in Iraq and Upper Mesopotamia during the Islamic conquest of Persia. A daughter of the Utba chieftain Rabi'a ibn Bujayr named Umm Habib was taken captive and sent to Medina, where she was purchased by Ali ibn Abi Talib; she gave birth to Ali's twins, Umar al-Kabir and Ruqayya. At some point during the Muslim conquests, the Taghlib switched allegiance to the Muslims whilst retaining their Christian faith. Among the most prominent defectors was Utba ibn al-Waghl, a Kufa-based activist from the Sa'd line of the Jusham division. Much of the Taghlibi troops of the Muslim army settled in Kufa. Their eventual defection to the Muslims and Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab's embrace of their support gained the Taghlib a special exemption from the poll tax collected from the Caliphate's Christian subjects.Lecker 2000, pp. 91‚Äì92. During the First Muslim Civil War (656‚Äì661), members of the Taghlib fought on the side of Ali ibn Abi Talib at the Battle of the Camel (656) and the Battle of Siffin (657). However, at Siffin, a significant Taghlibi force also fought alongside Mu'awiya . =Umayyad period= The Taghlib's shared Christian faith and proximity to the Muslims' enemy, the Byzantine Empire, was the likely reason members of the tribe were not assigned important positions in the state during the Umayyad era. Nonetheless, they backed the Umayyads during the Second Muslim Civil War (680‚Äì692). Initially, they nominally supported the rebellious Qaysi tribes in the Qays‚ÄìYaman conflict, an episode of the civil war. However, after the Qaysi Banu Sulaym tribe encroached on their villages in the Khabur Valley and attacked the tribe with sanction from the anti-Umayyad leader Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, the Taghlib turned against the Qays. The conflict with Qays likely precipitated the Taghlib's reconciliation with the Banu Bakr. The Taghlibi chieftain Hammam ibn al-Mutarrif secured the peace and alliance of the two tribes by compensating the Bakr for their losses at the Battle of Dhi Qar. A leader of the Taghlib, Abd Yasu', served as the Taghlib and Bakr's joint envoy to Caliph Abd al-Malik (). The Taghlib's champion during their conflict with the Qays was the well-known Taghlibi poet al-Akhtal, whose main poetic rival was the Qaysi Jarir, with whom he engaged in \\"verbal warfare\\" in the Umayyad court. Under Abd al-Malik, al-Akhtal was the official poet of the Umayyad court and vigorously championed the Umayyads' against their opponents. The Taghlibi‚ÄìQaysi conflict culminated with a decisive Taghlibi victory at Yawm al-Hashshak in the Jazira near the Tigris River, in which the Sulaymi chief Umayr ibn al-Hubab was slain; the Taghlib sent the latter's head to Abd al-Malik, who was pleased with the death of the rebel leader. The last Umayyad caliph Marwan II () appointed the Taghlibi tribesman and descendant of al- Saffah, Hisham ibn Amr ibn Bistam, as governor of Mosul and the Jazira. =Abbasid period= The Abbasid caliph al-Mansur () reassigned Hisham ibn Amr to Sind. Caliph al-Mahdi () replaced Hisham with his brother Bistam, before reassigning the latter to Adharbayjan. Both Hisham and Bistam were Muslims. Another Taghlibi Muslim, Abd al-Razzaq ibn Abd al-Hamid led an Abbasid expedition against the Byzantines in the summer of 793. In the early 9th century, the Adi ibn Usama line of the Malik division, known as the  øAdƒ´ Taghlib or al- øAdawƒ´yya gained political prominence in the Jazira. One of their members, al-Hasan ibn Umar ibn al-Khattab was appointed governor of Mosul by Caliph al-Amin in 813. Some years later, another Taghlibi linked to al-Hasan by marriage, Tawk ibn Malik of the Attab line of the Jusham division, became governor of Diyar Rabi'a under Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813‚Äì833). Tawk's son Malik ibn Tawk served as governor of Jund Dimashq (district of Damascus) and Jund al-Urdunn (district of Jordan) under caliphs al-Wathiq () and al- Mutawakkil (). He later founded the Euphrates fortress town of al-Rahba (modern Mayadin).Lecker 2000, pp. 92‚Äì93. =Hamdanid dynasty= In the 880s, a member of the Adi Taghlib, Hamdan ibn Hamdun, joined the Kharijite Rebellion against Caliph al-Mu'tadid.Canard 1971, p. 126. At the time, Hamdan held a number of forts in the Jazira, including Mardin and Ardumusht, but in 895, the Abbasids captured the former and afterward, Hamdan's son Husayn surrendered Ardumusht and joined al-Mu'tadid's forces. Hamdan surrendered to the Abbasids outside of Mosul and was imprisoned, but Husayn's good offices with al- Mu'tadid gained Hamdan a pardon. Husayn led or participated in Abbasid expeditions against the Dulafids, the Qarmatians and Tulunids during the reign of Caliph al-Muktafi (), but fell from grace for taking part in the plot to install Abdallah ibn al-Mu'tazz as caliph in 908. Husayn's brothers Abu'l Hayja Abdallah (governor of Mosul in 905‚Äì913 and 914‚Äì916), Ibrahim (governor of Diyar Rabi'a in 919), Dawud (governor of Diyar Rabi'a in 920) and Sa'id remained loyal to the Abbasids and Husayn eventually gained a pardon and was appointed governor of Diyar Rabi'a in 910. He later revolted, was captured and executed in 916. Abu al-Hayja', meanwhile, was again made governor of Mosul in 920, serving until his death in 929. Upon Abu al-Hayja's death, his son Nasir al-Dawla, who ruled as his father's deputy ruler in Mosul, struggled to secure the governorship of that city.Canard 1971, p. 127. His rule was opposed by his uncles Sa'id and Nasr, the Banu Habib (a rival Taghlibi clan) and Caliph al- Muqtadir (). By 935, Nasir al-Dawla had prevailed against them and was appointed by Caliph al-Radi () as governor of Mosul and all three provinces of the Jazira, i.e. Diyar Rabi'a, Diyar Mudar and Diyar Bakr. In 942, he became the effective ruler of the Abbasid Caliphate until being outmaneuvered by his rebellious Turkish officer, Tuzun, the following year. Nasir al-Dawla was deposed as governor of Mosul and the Jazira by his sons in 967. The province remained in Hamdanid hands until 1002. Meanwhile, Nasir al-Dawla's brother, Sayf al-Dawla founded the Hamdanid emirate of Aleppo and northern Syria in 945.Canard 1971, p. 129. His descendants would continue to rule the emirate until being deposed by the ghulam (slave soldier), Lu'lu' al-Kabir in 1002.Canard 1971, p. 130. The Hamdanids did not depend on their Taghlibi tribesmen for matters of the state, relying instead on non-Arab ghilman and bureaucrats for military and fiscal affairs. After the early years of the Hamdanid dynasty, the Taghlib, like many Arab tribes established in the region before and after the 7th-century Muslim conquests, \\"disappeared into obscurity\\".Kennedy 2004, p. 283. Religion Small numbers of Taghlibi tribesmen converted to Islam during the Umayyad era (661‚Äì750) and early Abbasid era (8th century), including the small Taghlibi community of Kufa, some tribesmen in Qinnasrin and noted individuals, such as the Umayyad court poets Ka'b ibn Ju'ayl and 'Umayr ibn Shiyaym.Lecker 2000, p. 92. The vast majority remained Christian during this period. Later in the Abbasid era, in the 9th century, significant numbers of Taghlibi tribesmen embraced Islam and attained higher office in the state. Apparently, the mass conversion of the Taghlib to Islam occurred in the second half of the 9th century during the reign of al-Mu'tasim (r. 833‚Äì842).Lecker 2000, p. 93. At around the same time, Malik ibn Tawk persuaded Sahl ibn Bishr, a great-grandson of al-Akhtal, to convert to Islam along with all of al-Akhtal's descendants.

It was given to Edmund Rogers of the National Press Agency in London. The key statement was that his father now supported home rule for Ireland. The statement was accurate but it is unknown whether the father knew and approved of releasing it to the press. The bombshell announcement resulted in the fall of Lord Salisbury's Conservative government. Irish Nationalists, led by Charles Parnell's Irish Parliamentary Party, held the balance of power in Parliament. Gladstone's conversion to Home Rule convinced them to switch away from the Conservatives and support the Liberals using the 86 seats in Parliament they controlled. Roy Jenkins, Gladstone (1997) pp 523‚Äì532.M. R. D. Foot. \\"The Hawarden Kite\\" Journal of Liberal Democrat History 20 (Autumn 1998) pp. 26‚Äì32. online The expression refers to Hawarden Castle, which was Gladstone's home. Background Although there is some historical debate surrounding the issue, the consensus is that the Hawarden Kite incident was a political disaster for William Gladstone. Gladstone had converted to Home Rule sometime during his second prime ministry of 1880‚Äì1885; however, he knew that passing it through Parliament, particularly the House of Lords, would be very troublesome. Therefore, Gladstone had sought cross-party agreement on the issue of home rule, thinking that the Conservatives should pass to make it easier to get it through the House of Lords. Catholic Emancipation in 1829, Corn Laws repeal in 1846, and the Reform Act 1867 had been all cross-party acts passed by Conservative governments. Gladstone also felt that the Electoral Act of 1884, which increased the franchise, would give him increased and perhaps permanent majorities in subsequent elections. Formerly a Conservative MP, he was now head of the Liberal Party, and considered that support from the Irish Home Rule MPs would further strengthen his position in the House of Commons. The Irish Party was then a third force in parliament. Meanwhile, in London on 1 August 1885 the Conservative minister Lord Carnarvon, Viceroy of Ireland, had met Charles Stewart Parnell, the Irish Home Rule leader, for a confidential discussion to see how far each could meet the other's policy. Parnell assumed that Carnarvon was representing the Cabinet and would agree to his proposals that Carnarvon described as \\"surprisingly moderate\\". Conservative leader Lord Salisbury wanted the meeting kept secret, now that he knew Parnell's position, and hoped also that Parnell would mention the discussion to Gladstone. This might move Gladstone to up the ante and formally declare his support for Home Rule, offering slightly more than Parnell had indicated to Carnarvon; Salisbury believed that such a declaration would split the Liberals.Roberts A. \\"Salisbury\\" (Phoenix, London 1999) pp.349-351. The kite On 17 December 1885 Gladstone's son, Herbert, had a letter published in The Times. It included: \\"Nothing could induce me to countenance separation, but if five-sixths of the Irish people wish to have a Parliament in Dublin, for the management of their own local affairs, I say, in the name of justice, and wisdom, let them have it.\\" This promised a large amount of local control within Ireland, but Ireland would remain linked to Britain, with Queen Victoria as head of state, and it remain in the British Empire. Being a modest measure, Gladstone hoped that Salisbury might feel honour-bound to allow his MPs to vote for and against the policy, thereby splitting the Conservatives. Reactions Once news of Gladstone's conversion came to light following the Hawarden Kite, Liberals and Irish Nationalist MPs voted together to end Lord Salisbury's caretaker administration. This led Salisbury to believe Gladstone was playing games with him and he remained opposed to Irish home rule. Salisbury had commented on 9 November: \\"The integrity of the Empire is more precious to us than any possession we can have. We are bound by motives, not only of expediency, not only of legal principle, but by motives of honour, to protect the minority.\\"Roberts, p.363 That minority in Ireland formed the Irish Unionist Alliance and the loyalist Orange Order increased its numbers markedly. Gladstone won the 1885 United Kingdom general election, but when he proposed the Government of Ireland Bill later in 1886, 93 Liberal MPs voted against, causing the 1886 United Kingdom general election. The Liberals opposed to Home Rule contested as the Liberal Unionist Party, and Lord Salisbury became prime minister with their support.

He was the first editor of the Eastern Daily Press and the founder of the National Press Agency. Background and education The son of John and Sarah Rogers, and given the middle name Dawson which was his mother's family name, he was brought up a strict Methodist and received a classical education at Gresham's School, Holt, then was apprenticed to a pharmacist. Career In 1845, he went as a surgeon's dispenser to Wolverhampton, where he joined the Staffordshire Mercury as a journalist. In 1848 he was appointed as editor of the struggling Norwich newspaper the Norfolk News, and put it on its feet. The proprietors at the time were two future Liberal members of parliament, Jacob Henry Tillett and J. J. Colman. On 10 October 1870, Rogers became the first editor of the Eastern Counties Daily Press, working for the same proprietors, remaining until 1872. In 1871, the paper was renamed the Eastern Daily Press. In 1873, Rogers moved to London and at the request of leading members of the Liberal Party established the National Press Agency in Shoe Lane, remaining as manager until he retired in 1894. The National Press Agency had an enormous scoop as part of the Hawarden Kite affair in December 1885, when William Ewart Gladstone's son Herbert Gladstone gave Rogers what he said were his father's opinions on Irish home rule. In London Rogers also published and edited The Tenant Farmer (1894‚Äì1898) and The Free Speaker (1873‚Äì1874). Spiritualist About 1843 Rogers was introduced by Sir Isaac Pitman to the work of Swedenborg. He went on to study mesmerism and mesmeric healing. He began to attend s√©ances in 1869 with various mediums, especially Mrs Thomas Everitt and William Eglinton, and became a spiritualist. In 1873 he helped to form the British National Association of Spiritualists, and in 1881 founded the spiritualist journal Light, which he edited from 1894 until his death in 1910. In 1881‚Äì1882 he founded the Society for Psychical Research, with Sir William Barrett. Its early members included William Stainton Moses, F. W. H. Myers, Henry Sidgwick, and Edmund Gurney, and Rogers was a member of its Council from 1882 to 1885. In 1884, he was a founding member of the London Spiritualist Alliance, afterwards the College of Psychic Studies, and was its president from 1892 until 1910.

Poison\\", is a former world featherweight boxing champion between 1975 and 1976. He is the first Ghanaian professional boxer to win a world title.  Amateur career  DK Poison started his amateur career in Accra. He is one of many boxers spawned by Bukom, a suburb in the heart of the city populated by the Ga people. Many top Ghanaian boxers such as Roy Ankrah, Azuma Nelson and Ike Quartey are products of Bukom.  Professional career  David Kotey turned professional under trainer Attuquaye Clottey. His first professional bout was on 5 February 1966 in Accra when he outpointed his opponent over six rounds. He became the national featherweight champion that year. Although he fought once in neighbouring Togo in 1967, all his subsequent fights through to 1971 were all in Ghana. In 1972 however, he fought as much as seven times in Australia, winning five and losing two. He won the African featherweight title on 2 February 1974 when he knocked out Tahar Ben Hassen in the first round of a scheduled 15 round fight in Tunis, Tunisia. Later on 7 December 1974, he also won the Commonwealth featherweight title with a technical knock out over Evan Armstrong, a British boxer in round 10 of a scheduled 15 rounds bout. This victory gave him an opportunity to go for the World Boxing Council version of the world title. On 20 September 1975, in The Forum, Inglewood, California, United States, he beat Rub√©n Olivares by split points decision after 15 rounds to become the first Ghanaian world boxing champion. He relinquished the African and Commonwealth titles following this victory. The Ghana government gave him an estate house at Teshie-Nungua, an Accra suburb in honour of this achievements in boxing. He however lost the title in his third defence on 6 November 1976 by unanimous points decision to Danny \\"Little Red\\" Lopez in a fierce fight in Accra, Ghana.He is married with three daughters. He also defeated Fuku Yama in Japan. DK Poison was never the same again after this defeat. He failed in 1978 to regain either the world or commonwealth featherweight titles. His last professional bout was in 1989 when he lost an African lightweight title fight.

He has gone through marital and financial difficulties and reportedly has some grievances about how his purse was disbursed during his boxing years. Loan to Ghana According to reports and Kotey's own story, in 1976, he loaned an amount of 45,000 dollars to the Government of Ghana, then led by Ignatius Kutu Acheampong. The money was intended for the purchase of canned mackerel to mitigate the harsh economic and food conditions the country was facing. The loan had been facilitated by his management, which was led by Col John Slater. According to Kotey, the money was part of his reward for defending his title against Japan's Fuku Yama in 1976. The loan has not been paid back to date because shortly after the canned mackerels arrived in the country, the Acheampong's regime was overthrown by General Akuffo in a military palace coup in October 1975. In September 2019,the president of Ghana, Nana Akufo Addo noted that he would look into the issue. This was at a meeting with a delegation of former world boxing champions from Ghana. The president of Ghana,Nana Akuffo Addo, on 6 October 2020 has directed an amount of $45,000 that was owed by Ghana to him on \\"compassionate grounds\\". Song After Kotey won the World featherweight title in Accra in September 1975, one of Ghana's leading highlife artists at the time, Senior Eddie Donkor released a song in Twi in his honour entitled \\"D.

The house was built during the early 19th century, following the precepts of Georgian architecture, and its estate eventually included all of the hamlet or tithing of Ashton Gifford. The house sits in the Wylye valley, part of the Cranborne Chase Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Ashton Gifford House, Ashton Gifford, seen from the Codford Ridge to the south of the property Early history Ashton Gifford is recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book, listed as land belonging to Humphrey de l'Isle. The land was held by Robert, previously (under King Edward) having been held by Cynewig. Ashton Gifford was a relatively prosperous estate, valued at six pounds (from four pounds in 1066). The estate consisted of of meadow, and pasture \\"6 furlongs long and as much broad\\". The site of the Anglo Saxon settlement can be seen in the field to the south of the current Ashton Gifford House, where different patches of colour in the earth indicate the sites of Anglo Saxon houses. There is reference to the manor being known as Ashton Dunstanville in the late 14th century.\\"Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society Journal\\" 1872, page 334 The 1773 version of Andrews' and Dury's map of Wiltshire refers to Ashton Gifford as \\"Isherton\\". The map shows around eleven houses forming the tything or hamlet of Ashton Gifford.\\"Codford: Wool and War in Wiltshire\\", John Chandler, Phillimore 2007\\"  Enclosure  An Act of Enclosure was passed for the \\"Tything of Ashton Gifford, in the Parish of Codford Saint Peter\\" on 27 May 1814.\\"An act for inclosing Lands in the Tything of Ashton Gifford, in the Parish of Codford Saint Peter, in the county of Wilts. This allowed for the enclosure of lands in the hamlet, naming William Hubbard Esq., William Hinton Esq., and Sarah Bingham, Spinster as the owners under the Lord of the Manor of Codford St Peter (Harry Biggs Esq.). Three \\"gentlemen\\" were appointed Commissioners for the enclosure: John Hayward of Rowde, John Rogers of Burcombe and Ambrose Patient of Corton. The Commissioners were instructed to meet at \\"a certain House called the George Inn in Codford Saint Peter aforesaid\\".

The central part, of three storeys, has thick walls which were constructed as external walls and which now lie in between the central portion and the east and west wings of the property. It is surmised that this part of the property was constructed some time around 1806 by Benjamin Rebbeck, a local landowner who had purchased the property (including around of land) from the estate of the Earl of Shrewsbury.The title of lord of the manor of Ashton Gifford was held by the earls of Shrewsbury until this sale in 1806, at which point the lordship dissipatesAn R.

The address is given as \\"Ashton Gifford\\" Rebbeck lost the house to the mortgage holder in 1815 as a result of his spiralling debts, for which he was imprisoned in 1818, and the mortgage holder, William Hubbard, who is mentioned in the enclosure of Ashton Gifford, took possession of the house and added the two ashlar wings. William Hubbard appears to have been resident by May 1817 (at the latest).Auction Catalogue of D&E; Lake Limited, citing William Hubbard of Ashton House as provenance for a lot, as of 17 May 1817 Hubbard also increased the size of the estate, to around . The walled garden, which appears to have been constructed around this time, and which is still a part of the property, lies to the west of the current house.

The owners added a service wing to the western side of the house, running from the original Georgian structure towards the walled garden. This wing contained the kitchens for the house (two in number), two dairies, pantries and store rooms, and servants' accommodation.Auction brochure, Ashton Gifford House, Constable and Maude (of London), for a public auction held on 20 November 1929 This wing was damaged by fire in the 1950s, and demolished in the early 1970s.

The main entrance is a distyle in antis Tuscan portico to the centre with inserted double half-glazed doors and flanking tripartite sashes, an inner main door with 6 fielded panels, fanlights and flanking margin-pane round-arched sashes with interlaced glazing bars. The ground floor of centre block has rusticated stonework. The first floor has three 9-pane sashes, and the second floor has a plat band and three 6-pane sashes. The two-storey side-bays have 8-pane margin sashes and a plat band. At the roof level there is a moulded cornice to the plain stone parapet with 20th-century pineapple decorations. At the rear of the property there are two central bays which break forward with 12-pane sashes to ground floor, 9-pane to first and 6-pane sashes to second floor, side-bays have 8-pane margin sashes to ground and first floors. The interior features of the property that are highlighted by English Heritage include the central entrance hall with an oval open-well staircase (which has a continuous handrail and cast-iron balusters). Also noted are the presence of period doors, of six- panelled design, in panelled reveals and moulded architraves, and the existence of period window shutters. On the ground floor, the drawing room has a scrolled plaster ceiling margin and a fireplace, which are singled out for special mention.

The doorway was subsequently repositioned in the central bay, restoring the symmetrical appearance of the front of the house. The Georgian portion of the house had, at this time, additional chimney stacks - two on the eastern and two on the western outer walls, servicing the upper floors of the property. These four stacks were removed later, and only the four central chimney stacks remain.

This finally closed in 1989, and ownership was transferred to a charitable trust.  Reversion to private dwelling  In 1992 Ashton Gifford House was sold, and planning permission was granted to convert it back to a private residence. The Codford by-pass (the A36 road) was built through the northernmost part of the property in the mid-1980s, shortening the drive. (George Sassoon was to unsuccessfully fight a similar encroachment of his father's estate at Heytesbury). This required some of the agricultural land and woodland to be sold to the Department of Transport. The east drive for Ashton Gifford House now emerges onto Sherrington Lane, while the west drive continues its original link with Ashton Gifford Lane (prior to the breakup of the estate, Ashton Gifford Lane made up the complete length of the west drive, terminating at the Thatched or Station Lodge on Station Road).

The station focuses on news and information, and is the primary National Public Radio network affiliate for the Louisville radio market. WFPL is now owned by Louisville Public Media and was originally owned by the Louisville Free Public Library. When the station came on the air in 1950, it was the first library-owned radio station in the country. WFPL's transmitter is off Moser Knob Road in New Albany, Indiana, amid the towers for other Louisville-area FM and TV stations.Radio-Locator.com/WFPL-FM The 21,000 watt signal covers parts of Kentucky and Indiana. History On February 20, 1950, WFPL first signed on the air. It began operating as a public radio station under the ownership of the Louisville Free Public Library, giving the station the distinction of being the first library-owned radio station in the country. Founded years before the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 and National Public Radio's creation in 1970, the station was made possible by the donation of equipment by the Bingham family, who owned The Courier-Journal and WHAS 840 AM radio at the time. In 1993, the library joined with the University of Louisville to form the Public Radio Partnership (now Louisville Public Media) to operate WFPL and the city's other public radio stations, WFPK and WUOL-FM. Since then, WFPL has steered away from music to focus on broadcasting news and informational programming. Like its sister stations, WFPL broadcasts an HD radio signal. Awards In 1951 WFPL won a George Foster Peabody award for public service.
