The text was fabricated in the Russian Empire, and was first published in 1903. While there is continued popularity of The Protocols in nations from South America to Asia, since the defeat of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan in World War II, governments or political leaders in most parts of the world have generally avoided claims that The Protocols represent factual evidence of a real Jewish conspiracy. The exception to this is the Middle East, where a large number of Arab and Muslim regimes and leaders have endorsed them as authentic. Past endorsements of The Protocols from Presidents Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar Sadat of Egypt, Iraqi President Arif, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, and Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi of Libya, among other political and intellectual leaders of the Arab world, are echoed by 21st century endorsements from the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Sheikh Ekrima Sa'id Sabri, and Hamas, to the education ministry of Saudi Arabia. at Anti-Defamation League Middle East As popular opposition to Israel spread across the Middle East in the years following its creation in 1948, many Arab governments funded new printings of the Protocols and taught them in their schools as historical fact. They have been accepted as such by many Islamist organizations, such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad. A 2005 report by the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center found that Arabic editions issued in the Middle East were being sold as far away as London. There are at least nine different Arabic translations of the Protocols and more editions than in any other language including German. The Protocols also figure prominently in the antisemitic propaganda distributed internationally by the Arab countries and have spread to other Muslim countries, such as Pakistan, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

February 28, 2005 In Syria, government-controlled television channels occasionally broadcast mini-series concerning the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, along with several other anti-semitic themes.2003's Ash-Shatat, though produced in Syria by a private Syrian film company with Syrian government co-operation, was not shown in Syria. Egypt The Protocols were featured in a 1960 article published by Salah Dasuqi, military governor of Cairo, in al-Majallaaa, the official cultural journal. In 1965, the Egyptian government released an English-language pamphlet titled Israel, the Enemy of Africa and distributed it throughout the English-speaking countries of Africa. The pamphlet used the Protocols and The International Jew as its sources and concluded that all the Jews were cheats, thieves, and murderers. Iran The first Iranian edition of the Protocols was issued during the summer of 1978 before the Iranian Revolution after which the Protocols were widely publicized by the Iranian government. A publication called Imam, published by the Iranian embassy in London, quoted extensively from the Protocols in its issues of 1984 and 1985. In 1985 a new edition of the Protocols was printed and widely distributed by the Islamic Propagation Organization, International Relations Department, in Tehran. The Astan Quds Razavi Foundation in Mashhad, Iran, one of the wealthiest institutions in Iran, financed publication of the Protocols in 1994. Parts of the Protocols were published by the daily Jomhouri-e Eslami in 1994, under the heading The Smell of Blood, Zionist Schemes. Sobh, a far right monthly newspaper, published excerpts from the Protocols under the heading The text of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion for establishing the Jewish global rule in its December 1998 ‚Äì January 1999 issue, illustrated with a caricature of the Jewish snake swallowing the globe. Iranian writer and researcher Ali Baqeri, who researched the Protocols, finds their plan for world domination to be merely part of an even more grandiose scheme, saying in Sobh in 1999: > \\"The ultimate goal of the Jews ... after conquering the globe ... is to > extract from the hands of the Lord many stars and galaxies\\".

The period itself has been dubbed by some commentators as the Brown Bottom or Brown's Bottom.Goldfinger Brown's ¬£2 billion blunder in the bullion market, The Times, 15 April 2007The outlook for gold, The Daily Telegraph, 19 December 2008The Gold Bull Market Remembers How Gordon Brown Sold Half of Britains Reserves at the Lowest Price, The Market Oracle, Clive Maund, 1 April 2007 The Significance of the IMF-RBI Gold Sales, Tim Iacono, GoldSeek.com, 5 November 2009 In 2008, Gold Should Glitter, James Turk, SFO Magazine, February 2007.China & IMF Gold Sales; The Real Story, Warren Bevan, gold-eagle.com, 23 June 2009 The period takes its name from Gordon Brown, the then UK Chancellor of the Exchequer (who later became Prime Minister), who decided to sell approximately half of the UK's gold reserves in a series of auctions. At the time, the UK's gold reserves were worth about US$6.5 billion, accounting for about half of the UK's US$13 billion foreign currency net reserves. It is estimated that the decision cost British taxpayers almost ¬£7 billion. Events The UK government's intention to sell gold and reinvest the proceeds in foreign currency deposits, including euros, was announced on 7 May 1999, when the price of gold stood at US$282.40 per ounce (cf. the price in 1980: $850/oz Chart of gold 1968‚Äì99) The official stated reason for this sale was to diversify the assets of the UK's reserves away from gold, which was deemed to be too volatile. The gold sales funded a like-for-like purchase of financial instruments in different currencies. Studies performed by HM Treasury had shown that the overall volatility of the UK's reserves could be reduced by 20% from the sale. The advance notice of the substantial sales drove the price of gold down by 10% by the time of the first auction on 6 July 1999. With many gold traders shorting, gold reached a low point of US$252.80 on 20 July. The UK eventually sold about 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002, at an average price of about US$275 per ounce, raising approximately US$3.5 billion.Gold: Does Gordon Brown's regret selling half of Britains' gold reserves 10 years ago?, The Daily Telegraph, 8 May 2009 To deal with this and other prospective sales of gold reserves, a consortium of central banks - including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England - were pushed to sign the Washington Agreement on Gold in September 1999, limiting gold sales to 400 tonnes per year for 5 years. This triggered a sharp rise in the price of gold, from around US$260 per ounce to around $330 per ounce in two weeks, before the price fell away again into 2000 and early 2001. The Central Bank Gold Agreement was renewed in 2004 and 2009. Cost Gold prices remained relatively low until 2001, when the price began consistently rising in a protracted bull market. By 2020, the price of gold had reached US$2050, and the loss to the UK taxpayer (contrasted to selling the gold later) was estimated at more than ¬£18 billion, as the Euros bought with the proceeds had also risen in value. Analysis Brown's actions have attracted considerable criticism, particularly concerning his timing, his decision to announce the move in advance, and the use of an auction. The decision to sell gold at the low point in the price cycle has been likened by Quentin Lettshttps://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2008/11/browns-badly-ti.html to the mistakes in 1992 that led to Black Wednesday, when the UK was forced to withdraw from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, which HM Treasury has estimated cost the UK taxpayer around ¬£3.3 billion. It has also been argued that the sale of the gold reserves was a positive decision in that gold had been historically under performing and was paying no dividends to the Exchequer and the sale enabled the UK Government to pay off a substantial part of the national debt and keep repayment interest rates down on the remainder.https://www.ft.com/content/5788dbac-7680-11e0-b05b-00144feabdc0 , the UK retained a gold reserve of 310.3 metric tonnes.\\"Gold Demand Trends Q4 2013\\", \\"Top 40 reported official gold holdings\\" is on page 18 of the pdf file.

When performing an MST experiment, a microscopic temperature gradient is induced by an infrared laser, and TRIC as well as thermophoresis are detected. TRIC depends on the fluorophore's microenvironment, which is typically changed in binding events. Thermophoresis, the movement of the molecule in the temperature gradient, depends on three parameters that typically change upon interaction. Thus, the overall MST signal is plotted against the ligand concentration to obtain a dose-response curve, from which the binding affinity can be deduced. Microscale thermophoresis (MST) is a technology for the biophysical analysis of interactions between biomolecules. Microscale thermophoresis is based on the detection of a temperature-induced change in fluorescence of a target as a function of the concentration of a non-fluorescent ligand. The observed change in fluorescence is based on two distinct effects. On the one hand it is based on a temperature related intensity change (TRIC) of the fluorescent probe, which can be affected by binding events. On the other hand, it is based on thermophoresis, the directed movement of particles in a microscopic temperature gradient. Any change of the chemical microenvironment of the fluorescent probe, as well as changes in the hydration shell of biomolecules result in a relative change of the fluorescence detected when a temperature gradient is applied and can be used to determine binding affinities. MST allows measurement of interactions directly in solution without the need of immobilization to a surface (immobilization-free technology).  Applications   Affinity  * between any kind of biomolecules including proteins, DNA, RNA, peptides, small molecules, fragments and ions * for interactions with high molecular weight complexes, large molecule assemblies, even with liposomes, vesicles, nanodiscs, nanoparticles and viruses * in any buffer, including serum and cell lysate * in competition experiments (for example with substrate and inhibitors) Stoichiometry  Thermodynamic parameters  MST has been used to estimate the enthalpic and entropic contributions to biomolecular interactions.  Additional information  * Sample property (homogeneity, aggregation, stability) * Multiple binding sites, cooperativity  Technology  MST is based on the quantifiable detection of a fluorescence change in a sample when a temperature change is applied. The fluorescence of a target molecule can be extrinsic or intrinsic (aromatic amino acids) and is altered in temperature gradients due to two distinct effects. On the one hand temperature related intensity change (TRIC), which describes the intrinsic property of fluorophores to change their fluorescence intensity as a function of temperature. The extent of the change in fluorescence intensity is affected by the chemical environment of the fluorescent probe, which can be altered in binding events due to conformational changes or proximity of ligands. On the other hand, MST is also based on the directed movement of molecules along temperature gradients, an effect termed thermophoresis. A spatial temperature difference ŒîT leads to a change in molecule concentration in the region of elevated temperature, quantified by the Soret coefficient ST:chot/ccold = exp(-ST ŒîT). Both, TRIC and thermophoresis contribute to the recorded signal in MST measurements in the following way: ‚àÇ/‚àÇT(cF)=c‚àÇF/‚àÇT+F‚àÇc/‚àÇT. The first term in this equation c‚àÇF/‚àÇT describes TRIC as a change in fluorescence intensity (F) as a function of temperature (T), whereas the second term F‚àÇc/‚àÇT describes thermophoresis as the change in particle concentration (c) as a function of temperature. Thermophoresis depends on the interface between molecule and solvent. Under constant buffer conditions, thermophoresis probes the size, charge and solvation entropy of the molecules. The thermophoresis of a fluorescently labeled molecule A typically differs significantly from the thermophoresis of a molecule-target complex AT due to size, charge and solvation entropy differences. This difference in the molecule's thermophoresis is used to quantify the binding in titration experiments under constant buffer conditions. The thermophoretic movement of the fluorescently labelled molecule is measured by monitoring the fluorescence distribution F inside a capillary. The microscopic temperature gradient is generated by an IR-Laser, which is focused into the capillary and is strongly absorbed by water. The temperature of the aqueous solution in the laser spot is raised by ŒîT=1-10 K. Before the IR-Laser is switched on a homogeneous fluorescence distribution Fcold is observed inside the capillary. When the IR-Laser is switched on, two effects, occur on the same time-scale, contributing to the new fluorescence distribution Fhot. The thermal relaxation induces a binding- dependent drop in the fluorescence of the dye due to its local environmental- dependent response to the temperature jump (TRIC). At the same time molecules typically move from the locally heated region to the outer cold regions. The local concentration of molecules decreases in the heated region until it reaches a steady-state distribution. While the mass diffusion D dictates the kinetics of depletion, ST determines the steady-state concentration ratio chot/ccold=exp(-ST ŒîT) ‚âà 1-ST ŒîT under a temperature increase ŒîT. The normalized fluorescence Fnorm=Fhot/Fcold measures mainly this concentration ratio, in addition to TRIC ‚àÇF/‚àÇT. In the linear approximation we find: Fnorm=1+(‚àÇF/‚àÇT-ST)ŒîT. Due to the linearity of the fluorescence intensity and the thermophoretic depletion, the normalized fluorescence from the unbound molecule Fnorm(A) and the bound complex Fnorm(AT) superpose linearly. By denoting x the fraction of molecules bound to targets, the changing fluorescence signal during the titration of target T is given by: Fnorm=(1-x) Fnorm(A)+x Fnorm(AT). Quantitative binding parameters are obtained by using a serial dilution of the binding substrate. By plotting Fnorm against the logarithm of the different concentrations of the dilution series, a sigmoidal binding curve is obtained. This binding curve can directly be fitted with the nonlinear solution of the law of mass action, with the dissociation constant KD as result.

These interactions allow cells to communicate with each other in response to changes in their microenvironment. This ability to send and receive signals is essential for the survival of the cell. Interactions between cells can be stable such as those made through cell junctions. These junctions are involved in the communication and organization of cells within a particular tissue. Others are transient or temporary such as those between cells of the immune system or the interactions involved in tissue inflammation. These types of intercellular interactions are distinguished from other types such as those between cells and the extracellular matrix. The loss of communication between cells can result in uncontrollable cell growth and cancer. Stable interactions basolateral membrane is depicted as \\"sheets\\"; the space between these sheets being the extracellular environment and the location of adhesion protein interaction. Stable cell-cell interactions are required for cell adhesion within a tissue and controlling the shape and function of cells. These stable interactions involve cell junctions which are multiprotein complexes that provide contact between neighboring cells. Cell junctions allow for the preservation and proper functioning of epithelial cell sheets. These junctions are also important in the organization of tissues where cells of one type can only adhere to cells of the same tissue rather than to a different tissue. Tight junctions Tight junctions are multi- protein complexes that hold cells of a same tissue together and prevent movement of water and water-soluble molecules between cells. In epithelial cells, they function also to separate the extracellular fluid surrounding their apical and basolateral membranes. These junctions exist as a continuous band located just below the apical surface between the membranes of neighboring epithelial cells. The tight junctions on adjacent cells line up so as to produce a seal between different tissues and body cavities. For example, the apical surface of gastrointestinal epithelial cells serve as a selective permeable barrier that separates the external environment from the body. The permeability of these junctions is dependent on a variety of factors including protein makeup of that junction, tissue type and signaling from the cells. Tight junctions are made up of many different proteins. The four main transmembrane proteins are occludin, claudin, junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) and tricellulins. The extracellular domains of these proteins form the tight junction barrier by making homophilic (between proteins of the same kind) and heterophilic interactions (between different types of proteins) with the protein domains on adjacent cells. Their cytoplasmic domains interact with the cell cytoskeleton to anchor them. Anchoring junctions Of the three types of anchoring junctions, only two are involved in cell-cell interactions: adherens junctions and desmosomes. Both are found in many types of cells. Adjacent epithelial cells are connected by adherens junctions on their lateral membranes. They are located just below tight junctions. Their function is to give shape and tension to cells and tissues and they are also the site of cell-cell signaling. Adherens junctions are made of cell adhesion molecules from the cadherin family. There are over 100 types of cadherins, corresponding to the many different types of cells and tissues with varying anchoring needs. The most common are E-, N- and P-cadherins. In the adherens junctions of epithelial cells, E-cadherin is the most abundant. Desmosomes also provide strength and durability to cells and tissues and are located just below adherens junctions. They are sites of adhesion and do not encircle the cell. They are made of two specialized cadherins, desmoglein and desmocollin. These proteins have extracellular domains that interact with each other on adjacent cells. On the cytoplasmic side, plakins form plaques which anchor the desmosomes to intermediate filaments composed of keratin proteins. Desmosomes also play a role in cell-cell signaling. Gap junctions Gap junctions are the main site of cell-cell signaling or communication that allow small molecules to diffuse between adjacent cells. In vertebrates, gap junctions are composed of transmembrane proteins called connexins. They form hexagonal pores or channels through which ions, sugars, and other small molecules can pass. Each pore is made of 12 connexin molecules; 6 form a hemichannel on one cell membrane and interact with a hemichannel on an adjacent cell membrane. The permeability of these junctions is regulated by many factors including pH and Ca2+ concentration. Receptor proteins in direct-contact signaling Receptor proteins on the cell surface have the ability to bind specific signaling molecules secreted by other cells. Cell signaling allows cells to communicate with adjacent cells, nearby cells (paracrine) and even distant cells (endocrine). This binding induces a conformational change in the receptor which, in turn, elicits a response in the corresponding cell. These responses include changes in gene expression and alterations in cytoskeleton structure. The extracellular face of the plasma membrane has a variety of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids which project outward and act as signals. Direct contact between cells allows the receptors on one cell to bind the small molecules attached to the plasma membrane of different cell. In eukaryotes, many of the cells during early development communicate through direct contact. Synaptic signaling, an integral part of nervous system activity, occurs between neurons and target cells. These target cells can also be neurons or other cell types (i.e. muscle or gland cells). Protocadherins, a member of the cadherin family, mediate the adhesion of neurons to their target cells at synapses otherwise known as synaptic junctions. In order to for communication to occur between a neuron and its target cell, a wave of depolarization travels the length of the neuron and causes neurotransmitters to be released into the synaptic junction. These neurotransmitters bind and activate receptors on the post-synaptic neuron thereby transmitting the signal to the target cell. Thus, a post-synaptic membrane belongs to the membrane receiving the signal, while a pre-synaptic membrane is the source of the neurotransmitter. In a neuromuscular junction, a synapse is formed between a motor neuron and muscle fibers. In vertebrates, acetylcholine released from the motor neuron acts as a neurotransmitter which depolarizes the muscle fiber and causes muscle contraction. A neuron‚Äôs ability to receive and integrate simultaneous signals from the environment and other neurons allows for complex animal behavior. Plant cell-cell interactions Plant cells are surrounded by cell walls which are barriers for cell-cell communication. This barrier is overcome by specialized junctions called plasmodesmata. They are similar to gap junctions, connecting the cytosol of adjacent cells. Small molecules (<1000 Da), such as ions, amino acids, and sugars, can diffuse freely through plasmodesmata. These small molecules include signaling molecule and transcription factors. The size of the channel is also regulated to allow molecules up to 10,000 Da in size. The permeability of these channels is dependent on many factors, including Ca2+ concentration. An increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration will reversibly limit passage through the plasmodesmata. Unlike gap junctions, the cell membranes of adjacent cells merge to form a continuous channel called an annulus. Additionally, within the channel, there is an extension of the endoplasmic reticulum, called a desmotubule, which spans between the cells. The cell-cell interactions facilitated by plasmodesmata play an important role in development of plant cells and tissues and defense against viral infection. Transient interactions Immune system Leukocytes or white blood cells destroy abnormal cells and also provide protection against bacteria and other foreign matter. These interactions are transitory in nature but are crucial as an immediate immune response. To fight infection, leukocytes must move from the blood into the affected tissues. This movement into tissues is called extravasation. It requires successive forming and breaking of cell-cell interactions between the leukocytes and the endothelial cells that line blood vessels. These cell-cell interactions are mediated mainly by a group of Cell Adhesion Molecules (CAMs) called selectins. T helper cells, central to the immune system, interact with other leukocytes by releasing signals known as cytokines which activate and stimulate the proliferation of B cells and killer T cells. T helper cells also directly interact with macrophages, cells that engulf foreign matter and display antigens on its surface. T-helper cells that possess the appropriate receptors can bind to these antigens and proliferate resulting in T-helper cells that have the ability to identify the same antigens. Coagulation Coagulation or blood clotting relies on, in addition to the production of fibrin, interactions between platelets. When the endothelium or the lining of a blood vessel is damaged, connective tissue including collagen fibers is locally exposed. Initially, platelets stick to the exposed connective tissue through specific cell-surface receptors. This is followed by platelet activation and aggregation in which platelets become firmly attached and release chemicals that recruit neighboring platelets to the site of vascular injury. A meshwork of fibrin then forms around this aggregation of platelets to increase the strength of the clot. Cell interactions between bacteria Bacterial populations interact in a similar manner to cells in tissue. They communicate through physical interactions and signaling molecules such as homoserine lactones and peptides as a means to control metabolism and regulate growth . A common example and one of the most studied forms of bacterial cell interactions is biofilm. Biofilm is a cell aggregate that can be attached to biological or abiotic surfaces. Bacteria form biofilms to adapt to various environments such as changes in substrate availability. For example, the formation of biofilm increases a bacterial cell's resistance to antibiotics compared to cells which are not part of the aggregate. Pathological implications Cancer Cancer can result from the loss of cell-cell interaction. In normal cells, growth is controlled by contact inhibition in which contact with neighboring cells causes a stunt in cell growth. Contact inhibition is thought to be mediated by cadherins, proteins that play an important role in cell adhesion. This inhibition prevents cells from piling up on top of one another and forming mounds. However, in cancerous cells where expression of E-cadherin is lost, contact inhibition is lost and results in uncontrolled growth or proliferation, tumor formation, and metastasis. Bacterial pathogens In order for pathogenic bacteria to invade a cell, communication with the host cell is required. The first step for invading bacteria is usually adhesion to host cells. Strong anchoring, a characteristic that determines virulence, prevents the bacteria from being washed away before infection occurs. Bacterial cells can bind to many host cell surface structures such as glycolipids and glycoproteins which serve as attachment receptors. Once attached, the bacteria begin to interact with the host to disrupt its normal functioning and disrupt or rearrange its cytoskeleton. Proteins on the bacteria surface can interact with protein receptors on the host thereby affecting signal transduction within the cell. Alterations to signaling are favorable to bacteria because these alterations provide conditions under which the pathogen can invade. Many pathogens have Type III secretion systems which can directly inject protein toxins into the host cells. These toxins ultimately lead to rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and entry of the bacteria. Disease Cell‚Äìcell interactions are highly specific and are tightly regulated. Genetic defects and dysregulation of these interactions can cause many different diseases. Dysregulation that leads to leukocyte migration into healthy tissues can cause conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and some types of arthritis. The autoimmune disease pemphigus vulgaris results from autoantibodies to desmoglein and other normal body proteins. The autoantibodies disrupt the adhesion between epithelial cells. This causes blisters of the skin and mucous membranes. Mutations in the connexin genes cause 8 human diseases including heart malformations and neurosensory deafness.

His 1963 album Progressive Bluegrass may have been the first use of that title, later applied to a subgenre of bluegrass music by him and others. Eur, International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002, (Routledge; 4th edition, 2002, ), p.480. Biography Beginnings Roger Sprung began playing music at the age of seven when an interest in the piano was sparked by his nanny who taught him to play a tune. Later, around age ten, Roger took formal piano lessons for about a year, but by then he had already taught himself to play by ear. He was introduced to folk music as a teenager in 1947 when his older brother took him to hear musicians perform in New York's Washington Square. After taking up the guitar Roger soon took up the banjo, teaching himself to play by ear with the aid of 78 rpm records by Earl Scruggs. He was also influenced by Pete Seeger and Paul Cadwell, as well as Tom Paley, from whom he took a few banjo lessons. In 1950, Sprung made the first of many trips to bluegrass country, accompanying mandolinist Harry West to Asheville, North Carolina. There he had his first exposure to such traditional country musicians as Bascom Lamar Lunsford and Samantha Bumgarner.Steven D. Price, Old As the Hills, (New York: The Viking Press, 1975, ), pp. 83‚Äì84. These trips became a regular part of Sprung's musical life, and he passed along the styles and techniques he absorbed during them to his fellow musicians in the north. As bluegrass historian and performer Ralph Lee Smith wrote, \\"Banjo player Roger Sprung almost single-handedly introduced Southern bluegrass music to New York through his playing in Washington Square.\\"Ralph Lee Smith, Folk Songs of Greenwich Village in the 1950s and 1960s, (Pacific, Missouri: Mel Bay Publications, 2008, ), p. 9. In 1953 Sprung joined Erik Darling and Bob Carey to form the Folksay Trio. The group recorded four tracks on an anthology album that also included performances by Lead Belly and Woody Guthrie. One of the trio's songs, \\"Tom Dooley,\\" would later be popularized by the Kingston Trio and become one of the best-selling folk song recordings of all time.It has been suggested that the Folksay Trio's recording of \\"Tom Dooley\\" was in fact the inspiration for the Kingston Trio's later recording. The notes accompanying the CD collection, \\"The Kingston Trio: The Guard Years\\" make this claim, and the New York Times's obituary for Erik Darling states that the Folksay Trio version \\"strongly influenced the Kingston Trio when that group recorded the song.\\" (William Grimes, \\"Erik Darling Dies at 74; Musician in the Weavers\\", The New York Times, August 7, 2008, accessed October 26, 2009.) Alternate theories about the Kingston Trio's possible sources for the song have been put forth as well. For a thorough discussion of the subject, see Peter J. Curry, \\"Tom Dooley\\": The Ballad That Started The Folk Boom. Carey and Darling later joined Alan Arkin, who would go on to achieve fame as an actor, to form the highly successful folk group The Tarriers. Sprung was also a familiar face in the mid-1950s Washington Square gatherings of folk musicians in Greenwich Village. When the first edition of The Village Voice featured a page one story about the music scene, Sprung was one of the players interviewed by John Wilcock for the article, and was featured in the lead sentence: \\"Roger Sprung, 25, runs a TV repair shop in Lake Mohegan, New York, but every week end during the summer he comes to the Village to play and sing folk music in Washington Square...\\" \\"Music Makers Quit the Square, But Only for the Wintertime\\"The Village Voice p. 1, October 26, 1955. In 1957, Sprung formed another group, The Shanty Boys, with Lionel Kilberg and Mike Cohen.Ronald D. Cohen, Rainbow Quest: The Folk Music Revival and American Society, 1940‚Äì1970 (Culture, Politics, and Cold War), (University of Massachusetts Press, 2002, ) p. 140. Career Over the past six decades, Sprung has performed with such legendary folk musicians as Jean Ritchie and Doc Watson as well as with more recent country music artists Willie Nelson, Wynonna Judd, and Tanya Tucker.Price, pp. 84.Jeff Anzevino, \\"Roger Sprung\\", Hudson Valley Bluegrass Association, Inc., Newsletter, Number 20, Summer '99, accessed October 27, 2009. He has recorded with Guy Lombardo and the Royal CanadiansPrice, pp. 84‚Äì86. and toured with popular jazz singer Kay Starr.Price, pp. 85‚Äì86. His television appearances include the Jimmy Dean, Garry Moore, and Dean Martin Shows, and he has performed at both the Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall. For the past quarter century he has performed with guitarist Hal Wylie and various other musicians as \\"Roger Sprung, Hal Wylie and the Progressive Bluegrassers.\\" Sprung appears frequently at folk festivals and musical conventions, including the Philadelphia Folk Festival, at which he performed for 30 consecutive years,Nancy K. Crevier, \\"Roger Sprung: Newtown's Own 'Pioneer of Bluegrass',\\" The Newtown Bee, June 18, 2009, accessed October 24, 2009. and the Union Grove Fiddler's Convention in North Carolina, where in 1970 he was winner of the banjo competition.Steve Terrill, String Bands in the North Carolina Piedmont, (McFarland & Company, 2004, ), p 127. In the 1970s, he was a frequent visitor to the annual New England Fiddle Contest in Hartford, and a photo of fiddlers jamming with him was a frequently reprinted item in the contest's press kit, and on the home page of the revived contest in 1999. In addition to his performing and recording career, Sprung sells and repairs banjos and has been teaching banjo and other instruments since 1950. Notable among his former students were Erik Darling and John Stewart, who became replacement members of The Weavers and the Kingston Trio, respectively.Sprung's influence on other musicians extends beyond his teaching. He has been cited, for instance, as an influence on Bela Fleck, a banjo player whose eclectic repertoire resembles that of Sprung. See for example the \\"Roger Spring\\" entry at North American Urban Folk Music 1940‚Äì1960 ‚Äì Celebration 2008, Eugene Chadbourne, [ Roger Sprung Biography], and Frank Beacham's Journal, \\"Folkies Gather in New York's Washington Square Park for Reunion\\". Repertoire Sprung's recordings and concert appearances embrace a variety of musical genres. In addition to traditional bluegrass and ragtime music, his repertoire includes arrangements of Elizabethan and classical pieces, Broadway show tunes, jazz and big band standards, and holiday songs. Composers whose works he has arranged for banjo include Mozart, Weill, Sousa, Ernesto Lecuona, and Stephen Foster. Among the selections he has recorded are ones as musically diverse as \\"Hava Nagila\\", \\"Hello, Dolly,\\" \\"Turkey in the Straw,\\" \\"Jingle Bells,\\" \\"Puff, the Magic Dragon,\\" \\"The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise,\\" and \\"Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter.\\" Sprung's instrument is a 1927 Gibson which he reconstructed himself using parts from two other Gibson banjos.

Lafferty poses as Quincy Addams (from Boston) to get in. He has his men tie up Gomez and Morticia and his doubles take their places, confusing Pancho, who's still got the hots for Morticia. Lurch scares off the thugs and terrifies the assistant crook Louie the Lard (who was dressed as Little Bo Peep). Fester, trying to be nice, puts Lafferty on the rack. Lafferty tries to escape through the secret passage and steps on Kitty Kat's tail. When the police arrive upon responding to a noise complaint, Lafferty and his gang surrender. The Addams Family are then free to celebrate Halloween happily, ending the night by singing together in welcome for Cousin Shy.

Juan de Mesa y Velasco (1583‚Äì1627) was a Spanish Baroque sculptor. He was the creator of several of the effigies that are used in the procession during the Holy Week in Seville. De Mesa was born in C√≥rdoba and baptised on 26 June 1583. He entered the workshop of Juan Mart√≠nez Monta√±√©s in Seville in 1606. He died in the city in 1627. His early death, coupled with the large gaps in his biography, has led to speculation that he suffered from a chronic disease such as tuberculosis. Like his master, Monta√±√©s, de Mesa's works were realistic rather than imaginative in form, his sculptures closely replicate the human form. This was in line with the Catholic Church's aesthetic program for the visual arts following the Council of Trent, which sought to make the arts accessible to the poorly educated by using realistic forms. Processional effigies make up the bulk of de Mesa's extant work and are still objects of devotion. These works include Cristo del Amor, Cristo de la Buena Muerte and Jesus del Gran Poder.

Developed from the Vincent Rapide by Australian engineer Phil Irving in 1935, the Meteor was powered by Vincent Motorcycles first in-house engine and was one of four 499cc single models. As well as the 'standard' Meteor, Vincent produced a sports version, the Vincent Comet, as well as a TT racing model which shared many of the same cycle parts. Development Vincent-HRD began in 1928 when Phil Vincent acquired the name, as well as all the jigs, tools and patterns of the HRD Company. Vincent started with engines from other makers such as JAP and Rudge but problems with supplies led to the development of his own 500cc single in 1934. Vincent is quoted as saying at the time \\"...we never wanted to see another Jap engine as long as we lived and decided we should design and manufacture our own.\\" Designed by Australian engineer Phil Irving, the new engine was developed over three months and the prototype Series 'A' Meteor was refined and developed into a production model, the Series 'B' Meteor, which was produced at the same time as the Series 'C' Comet, with the main differences being the new Girdraulic front fork fitted to the Comet while the Meteor had traditional Brampton girder forks and a slightly smaller carburettor. An advanced feature of the new Meteor engine was an invention to reduce valve failure, which they decided was caused by lateral vibration. A special design of upper and lower valve guides, without a centre section, meant that the valves had no fulcrum and into the central section they fitted a forked rocker pressed onto a shouldered valve stem. This effectively eliminated the 'rocking' action of the conventional top-end rocker and Vincent top ends set a new performance standard. When production of Series 'B' models was phased out in 1950 the Meteor was dropped from the range, making it one of the rarer post-war Vincent-HRDs. Falling sales of expensive motorcycles led to closure of the Vincent works in 1956. Vanishing 'HRD' The letters HRD were discontinued in 1950 after Phil Vincent visited his American agents and was informed that HRD was too easily confused with the Harley Davidson HD badge. Vincent had gone to a lot of trouble to secure the rights to the HRD logo but had the letters HRD ground off all the castings, which were then polished - but it is still possible to see the letters on some models. Surviving examples Vincent Meteors in good condition are highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts. In March 2008 a 1939 Vincent Meteor 500cc sold by auction for ¬£28,000 ($46,000).

In a \\"vicious street battle\\", the freikorps was defeated and Schill was killed in action.Jacques (2006), p.973 Prelude Stralsund, a port at the Baltic Sea in Swedish Pomerania, was surrendered to France after the siege of 1807 during the War of the Fourth Coalition. During this war, Prussian captain Ferdinand von Schill distinguished himself by cutting off French supply lines using guerrilla tactics in 1806. In 1807, he raised a freikorps and successfully fought the French forces in what he intended to become a patriotic insurrection. When his corps was disbanded after the Peace of Tilsit on 9 July 1807, Schill was promoted to the rank of a major, decorated with the Pour le M√©rite, and became a hero of German resistance and patriotic movements.Clark (2006), p.347 In January and February 1809, the German resistance in French-held Westphalia invited Schill to lead an uprising. He agreed in April and drafted a proclamation which however was intercepted by the French, and left Berlin on 27 April when he was threatened with arrest.Clark (2006), p.348 With a freikorps of 100 hussars, Schill headed southwest towards Westphalia to stir up an anti-French rebellion, but news of the French victory in the Battle of Ratisbon made him change his plans. Schill turned northwards to secure a port,Parkinson (2001), p.86 hoping for relief by the British navy.Meckenstock (2004), p.435 Battle Killing of Ferdinand von Schill on the streets of Stralsund. Schill entered Stralsund on 25 May with 2,000 men. The freikorps was pursued by a French-led force of 6,000 Danes, Holsteiners, Dutch and French, who confronted Schill on 31 May inside of the town.Parkinson (2001), p.87 The Dutch auxiliaries, about 4,000 troops, were commanded by Pierre Guillaume Gratien, another 1,500 Danish troops were under general Johann von Ewald's command.Pelet (2009 reprint), p.32 Garnier's Dutch forces included the 6th and 9th infantry, 2nd Horse Regiment, two squadrons of hussars and two horse artillery batteries.von Pivka (1980), p.17 They entered the town after storming the Tribseer Tor gate,Pelet (2009 reprint), p.33 and engaged Schill's freikorps in street fights. Schill was killed, and the survivors of his freikorps dispersed or captured. Aftermath Execution of Schill's officers (center left) Eleven of Schill's officers were taken to Brunswick, and later executed in WeselHasubek (1987), p.1118 following an order of Napoleon Bonaparte. More than five hundred of Schill's men went into captivity. Schill's head was sent to The Netherlands for display in Leyden's public library, and only in 1837 the head was buried in Brunswick.Clark (2006), p.349 Schill was not alone with his plans to stir up an insurrection of the Prussian people against the French occupation. Other prominent plotters were Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick and Kasper von D√∂rnberg. All of them saw the Austrian resistance and the resulting War of the Fifth Coalition as a chance to expel Napoleon Bonaparte from Northern Germany as well. France however proved to be the stronger party, and Schill's defeat in the streets of Stralsund put a definite end to all plans for a popular uprising.Wienecke-Janz (2008), p.142 See also *Pomerania during the Early Modern Age *History of Pomerania (1806‚Äì1933) Sources References Bibliography  * Category:History of Pomerania Category:Battles of the War of the Fifth Coalition Category:Conflicts in 1809 Category:Battles involving France Category:Battles involving the Netherlands Category:Battles involving Denmark Category:Battles involving Prussia Category:1809 in Europe Category:May 1809 events Category:Swedish Pomerania Category:Battles in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ","title":"Battle of Stralsund (1809)"},{"id":"24950564","text":"Anton Anton Anton Anton (born December 22, 1949) is a Romanian engineer and politician.

It has been taking place in Barcelona every year since 2009. It takes place jointly with the oXcars, a free culture festival.  What is the FCForum  The FCForum is a major international meeting of the most relevant organisations and individuals working on the international scene, who are engaged in reflecting on the social and economic challenges of the dissemination of culture and knowledge in the digital age. FCForum 2009 The main objectives of the Free Culture Forum 2009 (from October 30 to November 1) were, on the one hand, building networks to optimise the efforts of the different groups and setting common demands against the proposals from industry and governments in their eagerness to control culture and information; and on the other hand reinforcing the self-organisation of tools and infrastructures to support free culture.Free Culture Forum Barcelona, Oct 29-Nov 1, by Cory Doctorow. The first edition of the Forum was organised by eXgae (now Xnet), Simona Levi, Mayo Fuster Morell, Networked politics and the Free Knowledge Institute. The FCForum 2009 produced the Charter for Innovation, Creativity and Access to Knowledge. The Charter has been disseminated and implemented worldwide, including the 26th Chaos Communication Congress in BerlinCharter for Innovation, Creativity and Access to Knowledge workshop in the 26C3 and the Free Culture X Conference.Notes for the FCX Workshop: Charter for Innovation, Creativity and A2K Official observers from the European Community's Commission for Culture and Education (Valerie Panis), the European Community's Commission for Consumer Protection (Katrine Thomsen) and Government of Brazil (through its Jos√© Murillo from its Department of Digital Culture ) were present.

It was organised by Xnet, Simona Levi, Mayo Fuster Morell and Yproductions, with the advise of Felix Stalder. It resulted in a Declaration and How to Manual on sustainability of creativity in the digital era. The FCForum declaration was signed by 80 organisations and individuals, including Richard Stallman.  Topics  Participants in the FCForum split into working groups focusing on the following topics: # Economic Sustainability and Governance of Open Online Collaboration # New models of sustainability for the creative sector # Tools for policy reformers # Open public sector information  Sustainable models for creativity in the digital age  In February 2011, two documents drafted by FCForum participants were released: Sustainable Models for Creativity and the How-To Manual for Sustainable creativity, addressed at political reformers, citizens and free culture activists. Both documents are based on an understanding that current royalties management and cultural distribution systems have become obsolete in the digital age, and the conviction that free software and peer production and distribution is not incompatible with market strategies and commercial distribution. The How-To Manual sets out a series of alternative commercial and non-profit models. It insists that the Internet must remain free and open in order to allow online collaboration models to develop, and it must be recognised as a tool that promotes contact between creators and the public. The manual offers an overview of new models that are already operating in a variety of fields, such as freemium, crowdfunding and micropayment systems in which users make small financial contributions to projects that are looking for seed funding through platforms such as Kickstarter and lanzanos.com or to existing initiatives that are given money depending on the number of users who vote for them (such as Flattr, created by Peter Sunde and Linus Olsson). It also claims that the creators of commercial cooperative platforms should share their profits with the creators of the content they publish.  FCForum 2011  The third annual FCForum was held in Barcelona on October 28, 29 and 30, under the title ‚ÄòNetworks for a R-evolution‚Äô. Day one revolved around sustainable models for creativity in the digital age. It included a round table on the current situation of film and the Internet in Spain, with √Ålex de la Iglesia, Juan Carlos Tous, Amparo Peir√≥, Eudald Dom√©nech and the lawyer Josep Jover. This was followed by a session in which Yproducciones, Kayros Transmedia, Daniel Granados, Kolector, Flattr, Goteo and Verkami explored some new sustainable alternatives for the creative sec tor.http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2011/10/28/actualidad/1319752808_850215.html Day two focused on challenges and tools for the defence of the Internet and of sharing in the framework of the digital revolution. Participants included the lawyer David Bravo, La Quadrature du Net, John Perry Barlow and Richard Stallman.  FCForum 2012  The fourth FCForum was held at Ars Santa M√≤nica on October 26 and 27. Day one explored the theme of sustainable models for the creative sector, with practical examples from the fields of journalism, education (Freeangle) and publishing (Bookcamping). The report on crowdfunding \\"Crowdfunding Experiences in Spain and Catalonia: Key Characteristics, Challenges and Obstacles. Inspiration and Recommendations for a Stronger Tool for Collective, Public and Private Cross-Financing‚Äù was presented by its authors. One of the main sections looked at how cyber crime is being used as an excuse to criminalize and control the Internet, with an introduction by the lawyer Carlos S√°nchez Almeida and presentations of projects such as Tor Project and Telecomix. Day two focused on democracy in the digital age, with debates on transparency in public institutions (Cuentas Claras, Discursia, Sueldos P√∫blicos, Graba to Pleno, Qu√© hacen los diputados, Open Knowledge Foundation, Access Info, Tu Derecho a Saber and Civio), journalism and freedom of information, and networked democracy. The 2012 FCForum also worked on a system for the collaborative reform of Intellectual Property legislation in Spain and the European Union, using documents linked to the FCForum and the proposal prepared by Quadrature du Net as a point of departure. The 2012 FCForum team also participated in the book Cultura libre digital - Nociones b√°sicas para defender lo que es de todxs, which was published by Editorial Icaria in 2012.  FCForum 2013  The FCForum 2013 took place on October 25 and revolved around four core themes: Creativity, Culture and Knowledge: New models of access and production; Data Science: The potential and limits of Big Data; Networked Democracy; and Electronic Money and Distributed Currency: Strengths and weaknesses.  FCForum 2014  The sixth edition of the FCForum was itinerant; it took place in different spaces and dates.

Niemier is credited with introducing the sit-on-top (SOT) kayak design. ‚ÄúI sort of introduced those,‚Äù Niemier said of the sit-on- top design. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt really invent it.‚Äù In January 1988, Tim founded kayak manufacturing and sales company, Ocean Kayak, to produce these unique kayaks using polyethylene. Ocean Kayak was producing upwards of 200 kayaks per day when its assets were purchased in 1997 by Johnson Worldwide Associates, now Johnson Outdoors, Inc.http://bbjtoday.com/blog/where-are-they-now/1797 Since selling Ocean Kayak, Niemier has been providing custom design services and creating new lines of stand up paddleboards and other watercraft for manufacturers and individuals.http://www.onwaterdesigns.com/  Beginnings  Niemier grew up in Malibu, California and loved being out on the water in spite of his fear of it. His expertise with watercraft started early, spending much of his spare time as a youth paddling along the coast and out to dive sites. He learned about their design dynamics and began testing designs of his own. In 1971, Niemier designed and produced his first kayak using fiberglass molding. While taking it to the beach to test he was asked how much it cost. Not expecting anyone to buy it, Niemier offered to sell it at three times his production cost. The price was accepted and, fresh out of high school, Niemier had sold his first kayak.http://www.sit-on- topkayaking.com/Articles/Designers/Niemier.html In the years following, Niemier set up shop in Malibu selling personally-designed kayaks to customers on a small stretch of beach near home. From this success, he realized the potential for much bigger sales volumes in larger markets.  Ocean Kayak  After years of successful design and sales, Niemier launched Ocean Kayak in Ferndale, Washington in 1988. Adopting rotational molding as the preferred production process, enabled producing kayaks in far greater quantities than possible with fiberglass molds. This supported the success they were having in the marketplace. In 1997, Johnson Worldwide Associates, Inc. (now Johnson Outdoors, Inc.), purchased the assets of Ocean Kayak. The terms of the purchase were not made public.  Currently  Niemier now lives in Bellingham, Washington where he continues creating new kayak and stand up paddleboard designs, provide business consulting services and speaking.

The NBJBHL is a member of Hockey New Brunswick and competes for the Don Johnson Cup at the interprovincial level. History In 2003, the original New Brunswick Junior B Hockey League folded. The league was formed in the 1980s from the five regional Jr. B leagues of New Brunswick when the New Brunswick Junior Hockey League folded in 1983. The void, in 2003, was filled by the New Brunswick Junior C Hockey League. In 2007-08, the league attempted to service both Jr. B and Jr. C needs in the province. A year later, the league elected to only send Jr. C champions to interprovincial play, sending that year's Junior C Champions, the Hampton Hurricanes to Atlantics. In the summer of 2009, five of the top teams of the NBJCHL broke away formed their own Jr. B league, the NBJBHL. These teams were the Moncton Vito's, Grand Lake Wild Moose, Port City Ice Dawgs, Tri-County River Cats, and Black's Harbour Silver Kings. As New Brunswick no longer has a formal Junior C league, bottom tier teams of the NBJBHL collectively make-up the Junior C division, with the winner competing at the Maritime-Hockey North Junior C Championship. In the Spring of 2012, the Moncton Vito's dropped the fifth game of the NBJBHL final to Tri-County to give them their third provincial title. Just like in 2010, the River Cats unceremoniously dropped the right to play for the Don Johnson Cup, the Atlantic Junior B Championship. The Vito's went in their place and with a 1-3-0 record in the round robin, advanced to the playoff rounds. In the semi-final, the Vito's defeated the 4-0-0 host St. John's Jr. Caps 5-4 in overtime. In the final, the Vito's defeated the 4-1-0 East Hants Penguins of the Nova Scotia Junior Hockey League 2-1 in overtime to become the first New Brunswick team to win the Atlantica Junior B Champion in a decade and the first Atlantic Championship for the new NBJBHL. For the 2013-14 season, the league lost the Miramichi River Maniacs but gained the Kent Coyotes and Fundy Cobras.

(May 1991). Hustler. Career Jim Leon was born in Washington, D.C. in 1959. He worked as a mechanic prior to becoming a professional wrestler and later lived in Charlotte, North Carolina and Baltimore, Maryland. He initially wrestled and trained only twice a week, while still a full-time mechanic, and quit three times due to his financial situation before deciding to fully commit to a career in wrestling. Throughout the 1980s, he wrestled up and down the Eastern United States and eventually became a regular in International Championship Wrestling and the National Wrestling Federation. In 1984, under the ring name Jim Nunna, he became the first heavyweight champion for the American Wrestling Federation in Georgia; while champion he began competing under his real name. Leon also started a wrestling school in a disused boxing gym located at the corner of North Avenue and Harford road. It was a Baltimore City run gym, wherein he and Dave Coleman, a pro wrestler who had been trained by Killer Kowalski trained a number of future independent stars including Steve \\"The Brawler\\" Lawler, \\"Playboy\\" Bobby Starr, and Axl Rotten. He later formed a team with one of his students, Joey Maggs, and twice won the tag team belts in Buck Robley's Deep South Championship Wrestling (later known as Southern Championship Wrestling). He and Maggs, as The Heavy Metal Connection, became a popular tag team in the Mid-Atlantic region as well as for promotions in Mississippi and Louisiana. In 1987, Leon was featured in an article for The Charlotte Observer in which he discussed his career and his experiences on the independent circuit. He also felt hopeful that he and Maggs might be hired by the National Wrestling Alliance. During the summer of 1988, while wrestling for Frank Cain's Star Cavalcade Wrestling, he and his student Axl Rotten briefly held the SCW Tag Team Championship after defeating The Smurfs (Corey Stevens & Dynamite Kid) for the titles in Montgomery, Alabama. They later dropped the belts to Rick Anderson & Snake Watson. In September, he defeated Moondog in Bainbridge, Georgia to win the promotion's heavyweight championship; the title had been held up the previous month when their last match ended in a double-disqualification. He has been credited not only for having trained some of the top Mid-Atlantic independent wrestlers of the 1980s and 90s, but for being one of the standout stars during the final years of the territory-era. Dr. Thom Parks, a former referee and well-known \\"dirt sheet\\" writer, said in a 2003 interview that Leon \\"was a party animal, but he was also a very talented grappler. I really think he would have went far had he lived longer. Jimmy was funny and he could have a four star match versus a broom. He really had a lot of talent. It's just too bad that more people didn't get to see it. Of course, when you party as much as he did and do some of the unwise things he did, you can't expect a long lifespan. Even though we didn't see eye to eye on everything, Jimmy was probably my best friend in the wrestling business.\\" Death On November 30, 1988, Leon was shot to death in Baltimore, Maryland.

It is located at a height of above sea level in fields known as Auf dem Acker, or simply Acker, in the middle of the Harz National Park and has its own observation tower. Its name comes from the legendary Hansk√ºhnenburg Crag (Hansk√ºhnenburg Klippe) 300 metres to the northwest, which was visited on 14 August 1784 by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Opposite the tower are the Hansk√ºhnenburg Rocks (Hansk√ºhnenburg Felsen) that are relatively small by comparison with the Klippe. A bronze plaque was mounted on these rocks in 1999 to commemorate Goethe's visit. In front of the Hansk√ºhnenburg Rocks, a monument was erected in 1924 to Albert Leo Schlageter. It has since fallen over and is rather weathered.  History  At the end of the 19th century, the Osterode branch of the Harz Club built the first wooden observation tower and a managed refuge hut on the thickly wooded Acker crest; the hut being opened in 1889. The tower proved unable to cope with the weather conditions and, by 1912, had become so damaged that it had to be torn down. One year later, the Hanover branch began the construction of a stone tower on the same spot; it was completed in 1914. The First World War brought tourism to a standstill and the hut which was being managed as an inn, was closed, not least because it was a long way from any other settlements. In 1922, the guest house opened again until the Second World War broke out. In 1947, the hut, which had meanwhile become quite dilapidated, re-opened, but had to be closed again in 1957 when the hut and tower were placed out of bounds by the police due to their condition. In 1958 it had been refurbished sufficiently to enable the ban to be lifted again. but the fundamental overhaul that was really required was not carried out. In 1971 the damage to the Hansk√ºhnenburg was once again so serious, that the structure was closed again. After emergency repairs the tower and hut re-opened in 1972. The Harz Club did not have the necessary means to restore the structure and transferred ownership in 1974 to the district of Osterode, which took on the conversion and upgrade of the Hansk√ºhnenburg. In 1975 this was completed at a cost of 500,000 DM and the operation of the hut started up again. In 1976, a long cross-country skiing trail, the Ackerloipe, was completed and, as a result, the Hansk√ºhnenburg became a popular stop for langlauf skiers. Since the 1960s, the forest on the Acker crest has steadily retreated. At one time, the hut was hidden in thick forest; today, it is visible from a long way off. The tower offers a good all- round view over the mountains of the Upper Harz. It is also the only spot from where the two former centres of the Upper Harz mining industry, Clausthal and Sankt Andreasberg, can be seen at the same time.  Walking trails  The Hansk√ºhnenburg may be reached from all directions on numerous walking trails. There are longer walks from Osterode via the town forest (Stadtwald) and crest path (Kammweg) or along the S√∂se Reservoir. From Herzberg a path climbs from Lonau through the valleys of the Gro√üer Lonau (metalled road) and the Sieber. The height difference is markedly less on the route from Riefensbeek- Kamschlacken to the hut. The easiest way to get to the hut, however, is from Stieglitzecke on the Harz High Road. Here there is a large car park and a bus stop. From the Stieglitzecke there are two routes to the Hansk√ºhnenburg. The path on the eastern side is a wide walking track with only one steep section shortly before the hut. Considerably better views, especially in the morning, are offered by the path on the west side of the Acker. This path is however very hard going and rather boggy because the rain gutters have not been replaced for some time. The tower is only accessible when the restaurant is open. The Hahnsk√ºhnenburg is checkpoint no. 144 in the Harzer Wandernadel system, a popular network of walking trails.

Geography  left The ridge begins south of the Bruchberg near Stieglitzecke (on the B 242) and runs from there for about towards the southwest. For the first its crest is continuously higher than 800 metres. Its southwestern foothills transition to the Harz Foreland at Osterode am Harz. Together with the Bruchberg, the Acker forms the Acker-Bruchberg Massif. Northwest of the ridge lies the valley of the River S√∂se and the S√∂se Reservoir, as well as the villages of Riefensbeek and Kamschlacken. South of the ridge lie the villages of Lonau and Sieber. The Hansk√ºhnenburg lies roughly in the middle of the ridge at a height of 811 metres.  National Park and environment  Large sections of the ridge lie within the Harz National Park and may therefore only be entered on designated trails. Between the Hansk√ºhnenburg and Stieglitzecke parts of the area around the crest consist of raised bog. The ridgeway running through the moor was closed in the mid-1990s, shortly after the establishment of national park in order to protect the environment.

From here two trails lead up the Acker; they are described in more detail in the article on the Hansk√ºhnenburg. From the Hansk√ºhnenburg the ridgeway, known as the Wet Way (Nasser Weg) runs in a southwesterly direction along the crest towards Osterode. Because the ridge here is only lightly vegetated with bilberry and low pines, there are many viewing points with good views over the Harz and into the Harz Foreland. On or by the Acker are several refuge huts that have checkpoints as part of the Harzer Wandernadel hiking network: *Morgenbrodtsh√ºtte am Gro√üen Wehr - no. 146. *Waidmannsruhe hut - no. 148. *Hansk√ºhnenburg - no. 144. *K√∂te am Schindelkopf hut - no. 143 A stage of the Harzer Baudensteig trail runs from Lerbach over the Acker to Sieber.  Geology  The ridge is largely composed of Acker-Bruchberg Quartzite.  Origin of the Name  In various sources it is maintained that the name Acker is derived from the Middle High German word Agger which means \\"crest\\" or \\"embankment\\". However, there is no definite source for this theory. On the other hand, Agger is a Latin word and means \\"earth embankment\\", see Agger (ancient Rome).

A corporate real estate portfolio typically includes a corporate headquarters and a number of branch offices, and perhaps also various manufacturing and retail sites. Concept Corporate real estate may also describe the functional practice, department, or profession that is concerned with the planning, acquisition, design, construction/fit-up, management, and administration of real property on behalf of a company. Generally, corporate real estate professionals approach the real estate market from the owner-occupant perspective, both leased or the buy-side, primarily demand perspective, similar to corporate purchasing or procurement. As such, they seek to contain costs, and may benefit from economic environments that are described by most as \\"weak\\". Although closely related to facilities management and property management, Corporate real estate as a concept is usually broader in corporate functional scope but more narrow within the real estate sector. For instance, corporate real estate professionals (or departments) typically dedicate greater emphasis and time on multi-site long-range planning (often called \\"portfolio planning\\" or \\"strategic planning\\").

He was also a conspiracy theorist who founded The Conspiracy Museum in Dallas. Early life Cutler was born in Charles River, Massachusetts to Roger W. and Leslie Bradley Cutler. His father was a noted rower who had been captain of the Harvard Crew in 1911 and competed in the 1914 Henley Royal Regatta as a member of the Union Boat Club. Athletic career Cutler attended the Noble & Greenough School, where he rowed No. 2 in eights. He went on to Harvard College and the Harvard Graduate School of Design. During his freshman year, Cutler was the No. 2. He stroked the JV boat during his junior year. In 1935, Cutler was promoted to varsity pace setter after team captain Sam Drury was demoted to No. 2 following the Syracuse-Cornell-Tech-Harvard regatta. Cutler graduated from Harvard University in 1935. In 1936, Cutler was a member of a Riverside Boat Club crew, which consisted of himself, his brother Roger, William Haskins, J. Paul Austin, and Edward Bennett, that sought to make the U.S. Olympic team. On July 4, 1936, The Riverside Boat Club qualified for the Olympics by defeating the Washington Huskies. In the Olympic men's coxed four, the Riverside Boat Club was eliminated in the semi-finals. Personal life On April 15, 1939, Cutler married Marion Lawrence in Groton, Massachusetts. The ceremony was officiated by Endicott Peabody and William Appleton Lawrence. Marion Cutler was granted a divorce on September 25, 1944 on grounds of cruel and abusive treatment. She was granted custody of their two children. On November 24, 1945 he married Claire Demmer in San Francisco. The couple had two children and resided in Beverly Farms, Massachusetts, Grafton, Massachusetts, and Whitinsville, Massachusetts. Later life In 1953, Cutler was accused of using his mother's influence as a state senator to pressure the Massachusetts Airport Management Board into giving his architecture firm a contract for a control tower at Logan Airport. Chairman George A. McLaughlin presented as evidence a drawing of a pie with a segment marked \\"$25,000 survey\\" removed from it with the caption \\"Commissioner, you know, we like our pie a la mode\\". Massachusetts Attorney General George Fingold cleared Cutler of any wrongdoing, stating that Cutler's sketch was an attempt at humor. Cutler researched extensively the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. He was known for constructing one of the most detailed maps of Dealey Plaza. On April 4, 1995, Cutler opened The Conspiracy Museum to promote his theories, which included the belief that Kennedy was shot and poisoned by three men, one of whom used a gas-powered umbrella pistol to fire a dart with a paralyzing agent at Kennedy to immobilize his muscles and make him a \\"sitting duck\\" for an assassination. He also believed that Lee Harvey Oswald was actually a C.I.A. spy named Alek Hidell. Gerald Posner, author of Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK, told the New York Times that \\"even among conspiracy theorists [Cutler is] not in the mainstream.\\" Professionally, Cutler worked as an architect. During World War II, he served as a lieutenant in the United States Navy. Cutler remained athletically active after the Olympics and was still rowing in Boston in the mid-1990s. He was a member of the Riverside Boat Club from 1921 until his death in 2010. Cutler died on September 1, 2010, aged 96, in Whitinsville, Massachusetts.

McLuhan's archetype \\"is a quoted extension, medium, technology or environment.\\" \\"Environment\\" would also include the kinds of \\"awareness\\" and cognitive shifts brought upon people by it, not totally unlike the psychological context Carl Jung described. McLuhan also posits that there is a factor of interplay between the clich√© and the archetype, or a \\"doubleness\\": > Another theme of the Wake [Finnegans Wake] that helps in the understanding > of the paradoxical shift from clich√© to archetype is 'past time are > pastimes.' The dominant technologies of one age become the games and > pastimes of a later age. In the 20th century, the number of 'past times' > that are simultaneously available is so vast as to create cultural anarchy. > When all the cultures of the world are simultaneously present, the work of > the artist in the elucidation of form takes on new scope and new urgency. > Most men are pushed into the artist's role. The artist cannot dispense with > the principle of 'doubleness' or 'interplay' because this type of hendiadys > dialogue is essential to the very structure of consciousness, awareness, and > autonomy.From Clich√© to Archetype, p. 99. McLuhan relates the clich√©-to-archetype process to the Theater of the Absurd: > Pascal, in the seventeenth century, tells us that the heart has many reasons > of which the head knows nothing. The Theater of the Absurd is essentially a > communicating to the head of some of the silent languages of the heart which > in two or three hundred years it has tried to forget all about. In the > seventeenth century world the languages of the heart were pushed down into > the unconscious by the dominant print clich√©.From Clich√© to Archetype, p. 5. The \\"languages of the heart,\\" or what McLuhan would otherwise define as oral culture, were thus made archetype by means of the printing press, and turned into clich√©. The satellite medium, McLuhan states, encloses the Earth in a man-made environment, which \\"ends 'Nature' and turns the globe into a repertory theater to be programmed.\\"From Clich√© to Archetype, p. 9. All previous environments (book, newspaper, radio, etc.) and their artifacts are retrieved under these conditions (\\"past times are pastimes\\"). McLuhan thereby meshes this into the term global theater. It serves as an update to his older concept of the global village, which, in its own definitions, can be said to be subsumed into the overall condition described by that of the global theater.

It is situated atop a mound off a minor road leading from the A6105, Greenlaw to Duns road in the old county of Berwickshire, now privately owned by the Letts family who live in the adjacent Polwarth Manse and is available for weddings. It lies south-west of Duns and east of Greenlaw at .  History  The origins of the kirk are somewhat vague though a plaque in the church buildings claims there was a church dedicated at Polwarth, Scottish Borders by 900AD. Unfortunately there are no records to substantiate that claim. The first records of the church comes in 1242AD when David de Bernham, bishop of St. Andrews, consecrated the church and dedicated to St. Kentigern. (St. Mungo) In 1296, Adam Lamb was the Parson at the 'church of Paulesworth' when he swore fealty to King Edward I of England at Berwick upon Tweed. Three years later Edward presented William de Sandynstone to the living at Polwarth. The church of Polwarth was said to be in a ruinous state by 1378 but John de St. Clair of Herdmanstoun in East Lothian, a son-in-law of Sir Patrick Hume of Marchmont, came to the rescue and provided the means of re-building the church.

Its traditional support basis has been amongst the landowning classes, as well as merchants and artisans and it tended to favour a unitary structure rather than federalism.Phil Gunson, Andrew Thompson & Greg Chamberlain, The Dictionary of Contemporary Politics of South America, London: Routledge, 1990, p. 79 Development The PC was formed by Gabriel Garc√≠a Moreno to be the party of state during one of his spells as President of Ecuador.Hugo Neira, 'Ecuador' in Jean-Pierre Bernard et al., Guide to the Political Parties of South America, Harmondsworth, 1973, pp. 330-367, p. 334 The party would then divide the Presidency with the Liberals until the 1895 coup that brought the reformer Eloy Alfaro to power, whilst the 1925 coup that ousted Gonzalo C√≥rdova (himself a Liberal) further entrenched reformist hegemony and damaged the PC.Neira, p. 335 The PC was able to regroup however, winning the election in 1931 for Neptal√≠ Bonifaz Asc√°subi, albeit with the result annulled. Whilst a member of their party was not elected the Conservatives endorsed the victorious Jos√© Mar√≠a Velasco Ibarra in 1933 and supported him again as part of the alliance to oust Carlos Alberto Arroyo del R√≠o after the Ecuadorian‚ÄìPeruvian War and subsequent treaties.Neira, pp. 339-40 They formed part of the very broad-based Democratic Alliance - which included the PC, elements of the Liberals, the Ecuadorian Socialist Party, the Velasquistas and even the Communist Party of Ecuador - that emerged after the war and which forced Arroyo del R√≠o out of office. In 1956 they were part of the coalition backing victorious candidate Camilo Ponce Enr√≠quez who assumed the Presidency, although the validity of the result was disputed by opposition groups and his cabinet was dominated by Liberals as a compromise. The PC candidate Otto Arosemena was also appointed President in 1966 by the Constituent Assembly. Tendencies Like many traditional political parties in South America the PC was a broad coalition featuring a number of interest groups. Foremost amongst these was the army which usually worked in close tandem with the PC. The Roman Catholic Church was the other great influence on the PC and the party sought to represent Catholicism in its most traditional form, to the extent that more radical elements broke away to form the Social Christian Party under Ponce Enr√≠quez. The two groups did subsequently co- operate however.Neira, p. 336 A more radical Christian tendency also existed in the form of the Frente Anti-Comunista de Defensa Nacional (FADN), an anti- communist militia group active during the late 1940s.Neira, p. 337 Distinct from the Christian tendency, although active around the same time as the FADN was the Alianza Revolucionaria Nacionalista Ecuatoriana, a tendency inspired by fascism that sought to directly confront leftists. Later years By the 1960s the PC, along with their Liberal rivals, had faded somewhat from their leading position in Ecuadorian politics. In the 1968 election they backed the unsuccessful candidacy of Ponce Enr√≠quez although he ran as a Social Christian candidate.Gunson et al., The Dictionary of Contemporary Politics of South America, p. 80 In the elections of 1978-9 they again backed the Social Christian candidate for the Presidency - who this time was Sixto Dur√°n Ball√©n - although the nine seats the party captured in Congress temporarily made them the third largest party in the body. By the 1980s both the Conservatives and Liberals were junior partners in the Frente de Reconstruci√≥n Nacional coalition of Le√≥n Febres Cordero, which was dominated by the Social Christian Party.Party Politics in the 1980s The party continues to be an active force amongst its traditional stronghold of the landowners but has suffered due to the departure of Popular Democracy and the introduction of universal suffrage which significantly reduced landowner influence.Kathryn B. Sanderson, ECUADOR: The Party System from 1963 to 2000 They held only two Congressional seats in 1984, which was reduced to one two years later. They retained independent membership of the Congress up to and including the 1996 election, since when they have been subsumed in coalitions.Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume II, p379 In the 2009 elections, a remnant of the Conservative Party, known as the Social Conservative Movement of Carchi, won a seat in the National Assembly of Ecuador from Carchi Province.

In 1984, when Alex was 12 years old, he emigrated from La Vega Province to Passaic, New Jersey, with his mother, stepfather, and two siblings. Two of his siblings have recently moved with him as well. Blanco's family struggled financially and received foodstamps for a time during Alex's childhood. He was paid by the Passaic School Board for taking the SAT's. Blanco graduated Kean University and New York College of Podiatric Medicine. Blanco was first elected in November 2008 in a special election to complete the unexpired term of former Mayor Samuel Rivera, who resigned after pleading guilty to attempted extortion. Blanco received around twenty eight percent of the 13,769 votes. In April 2009, he announced he was running for a full-term, and was endorsed by Senator Bob Menendez. Blanco won a full four-year term in the May election, defeating city supervisor Vincent Capuana. Blanco was sworn in July 1, 2009, when he began serving his four-year term. Blanco was described as the \\"classic American success story\\" by Gary Schaer, whom Blanco replaced as acting mayor in the 2008 special election. Bribery case and resignation In November 2016, Blanco pled guilty to a single federal count of bribery, agreeing to resign immediately. Blanco admitted in court to accepting $110,000 in bribes from two unnamed housing developers in exchange for directing more than $200,000 in HUD funds to a failed low-income housing development. He faced up to 10 years in federal prison upon sentencing, scheduled for February 2017. He was succeeded by Passaic County Freeholder Hector Lora, in an appointment made by the City Council. Blanco is the second consecutive elected mayor of Passaic, and the third in two decades (following Joseph Lipari and Sammy Rivera), to be convicted of or plead guilty to official misconduct charges.

Name Dormston's toponym has evolved from Deormodesealdtune in the 10th century via Dormestun in the 11th Century and Dormyston in the 15th century before reaching its present form.Page & Willis-Bund, 1924, pages 65-68 History Dormston existed in the 10th century, when King Edgar confirmed a grant of property including five manses at Dormston to Pershore Abbey of St.Mary. This was then given, with part of the manor of Pershore, to Westminster Abbey by Edward the Confessor, and Dormston was included in 1086 among the lands of St. Peter of Westminster. William Fitz Corbucion, whose principal seat was at Studley in Warwickshire, is said by Dugdale to have been succeeded by a Robert, who had been followed before 1166 by Peter Corbucion of Studley, who was then holding a knight's fee in Worcestershire (evidently Dormston) of the Abbot of Westminster. By 1320 the fee of Dormston had by that date become annexed to the manor of nearby Inkberrow until 1633.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/worcs/vol4/pp65-68#h3-0003 The manor subsequently changed hands several times. In 1388 the feudal superiority was in the hands of John Russell of Strensham and his descendant Sir John Russell of Strensham still held it in 1582. For a time, he was married to Elizabeth Sheldon, first cousin to William Savage of Elmley Castle (d.1616). (The Sheldons had also acquired the monastery lands at Studley). It appears to have been his son, another John Russell, who received a licence (presumably for the Savages) to crenellate the mansion-house at Dormston. This superiority appears to have followed the descent of Strensham until 1659, and it is possible that it still remained in the possession of the Russells and was sold after the death of the last male representative of the family, Sir Francis Russell, in 1705. What is clear is that Dormston was no longer a residential seat of the Russells, if it ever had been. By 1603 Dormston Manor was held by feu by Thomas Savage (d.1603) of Norbury Manor at Inkberrow, who settled it upon John Savage of Dormston for whom he was guardianButler, A.T., M.C., F.S.A., Windsor Herald, editor, The Visitation of Worcestershire 1634, London, 1938, p.88.(d. Jan 1616 and buried in St.Peter's Church, Inkberrow). The principal parts of the manorial demense were Courts Close and Bag End farm.The manorial records for Dormston & Nobury are today amongst the collections of the records of the Earls of Abergavenny. Russell himself was already related to the Savages as his mother, Margaret Lygon, was a first cousin to Francis Savage of Elmley Castle (d.1558), from whom the Inkberrow Savages descend. Dormston remained with this family until Robert Savage (1672-1749), who was married to Dorothy (d.1715), daughter of John Stanford of Salford Hall in Abbots Salford (d.1712). In 1701 he was one of local commissioners appointed in Worcestershire for collecting aid to meet the expenses of Her Majesty's navy guards and garrisons, and was again a local commissioner for the collection of a land tax in both 1710 and 1713. In 1730 Robert Savage was being sued in connection with the proposed sale of lands he held in Dormston, Kington & Inkberrow, and by indenture dated 1733 he sold the Bag End farm at Dormston which property eventually came by conveyance to Jane Suffield, aunt to the celebrated author J. R. R. Tolkien. In 1733 he was still described as Robert Savage 'The Elder', gentleman, of Dormston, implying he was still resident there. The following year his daughter Penelope was married in Worcester Cathedral, appropriate for gentry, to Giles Turberville, one of H.M. Excise Officers. Robert has signed the Marriage Licence and the Bondsman for this Marriage Bond, William Bristo, also came from Dormston. Robert Savage appears to be the last of this family seated at Dormston and he died at Alcester. He is interred at Inkberrow where there is a Savage chapel in St. Peter's Church. The 1634 Visitation gives the Arms of this family. Church Peter Corbucion granted a Chapel at Dormston in the reign of Henry II to the monastery he had founded at Studley in Warwickshire. The present Church of England parish church of Saint Nicholas has a 14th-century nave and chancel.

Chaumont was probably born in the city and spent most of his early years here. Lambert Chaumont (c. 1630 ‚Äì April 1712) was a Flemish Baroque composer and organist. Chaumont was from the Li√®ge area, possibly born in that city. The earliest mention of his name dates from January 1649, when he is listed as a lay brother at the Carmelite monastery at Li√®ge. He was still there in October 1651, and then a monastery accounts entry dated 8 May 1659 lists Chaumont among the nine brothers who completed their novitiates at the monastery at Reims. Nothing is known about the next 15 years of Chamount's life. On 10 February 1674 he was made rector of the parish of St. Martin's Church at Huy. The post was insignificant, and the church and the parish were very small, but eventually Chaumont's career progressed further. On 7 September 1688 he became priest of the parish of the nearby St. Germain's Church, and pater of the Carmelites at Huy. He occupied these positions until his death in 1712.Quitin, Grove. Chaumont's extant oeuvre comprises a collection of organ music, Pi√®ces d'orgue (Huy, 1695), and a work of piety published in 1709. At least one more collection of music is lost. Although he evidently spent most of his life in Li√®ge and Huy, Chamount's style in his organ pieces is entirely French. His collection is usually regarded as one of the best of the French organ school of the 17th century, particularly for its fine fugues, trios, and other contrapuntal genres, which are given prominence in the collection. Pi√®ces d'orgue comprises 111 pieces arranged in eight suites of 12 to 15 pieces each. The suites are united by mode, and follow the eight church tones. Somewhat unusually, each ends with one or two dances, mostly allemandes, although there are also two chaconnes (suites 2 and 6) and a gigue (suite 1) as well. Chaumont's writing, characterized by strong contrapuntal technique and a well-developed melodic imagination, has drawn many favorable comments from modern researchers and musicians. In a preface to a modern edition of Chaumont's works, scholar Roger Bragard claimed that the pieces impress the listener \\"not only by their richness and their melodic purity, but also by the undeniable strength of the technique\\".Apel 1972, 735. The renowned Belgian musicologist Jos√© Quitin wrote that the music is \\"distinguished by its seriousness, its convincing sense of form, the fascinating blend of sonorities and the serene elegance of the counterpoint.\\" Willi Apel, although slightly less enthusiastic, nevertheless agreed that Chaumont was a major composer with good taste and technique, and singled out Chaumont's r√©cits, which articulate their themes in phrases of varied length. In all of his r√©cits Chaumont develops the melody from a single motif, which recurs at the beginning of each phrase, but is continued differently every time. In addition to music, Pi√®ces d'orgue also includes a set of tuning instructions and two short essays, on accompaniment and plainchant. Notes References *Apel, Willi. 1972.

It selectively targets tumor cells expressing the CD30 antigen, a defining marker of Hodgkin lymphoma and ALCL (a type of T cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma). The drug is being jointly marketed by Millennium: The Takeda Oncology Company outside the US, and Seattle Genetics in the US. Approvals and indications In August 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval to the biologics license application (BLA) submitted by Seattle Genetics for the use of brentuximab vedotin in the treatment of relapsed HL and ALCL. In October 2012, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gave it conditional marketing authorization for relapsed or refractory HL and ALCL.EMA/European Medicines Agency: EPAR summary for the public for Adcetris/brentuximab vedotin In November 2017, the FDA approved brentuximab vedotin as a treatment for patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) who have received prior systemic therapy. This approval is for patients with primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) and CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides (MF). In March 2018, the FDA approved brentuximab vedotin to treat adults with previously untreated stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) in combination with chemotherapy. In November 2018, the FDA expanded the approved use of brentuximab vedotin in combination with chemotherapy for adults with certain types of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). This is the first FDA approval for treatment of newly diagnosed PTCL.  Approval In Australia  The Australian PBAC (Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee) considered a March 2014 application by the manufacturer for inclusion of Brentuximab Vedotin under a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Section 100 (Efficient Funding of Chemotherapy) arrangement. While this application was accepted, the committee noted that on the basis of inadequate cost-benefit, the medicine would not be made available more generally for the first-line treatment of relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL).PBAC Meetings March 2014 - Brentuximab Vedotin, 50 mg injection, 1 x 50 mg vial Adcetris¬Æ - March 2014 , March, 2014  Design  Brentuximab vedotinADC Review / Journal of Antibody-drug Conjugates: Brentuximab Vedotin, February 18, 2014 consists of the chimeric monoclonal antibody brentuximab (cAC10, which targets the cell-membrane protein CD30) linked with maleimide attachment groups, cathepsin cleavable linkers (valine-citrulline), and para- aminobenzylcarbamate spacers to three to five units of the antimitotic agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE, reflected by the 'vedotin' in the drug's name).ADC Review / Journal of Antibody-drug Conjugates: Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), May 23, 2013 The peptide-based linker bonds the antibody to the cytotoxic compound in a stable manner so the drug is not easily released from the antibody under physiologic conditions to help prevent toxicity to healthy cells and ensure dosage efficiency. The peptide antibody-drug bond facilitates rapid and efficient drug cleavage inside target tumor cell. The antibody cAC10 part of the drug binds to CD30 which often occurs on diseased cells but rarely on normal tissues. The antibody portion of the drug attaches to CD30 on the surface of malignant cells, delivering MMAE which is responsible for the anti- tumour activity. Once bound, brentuximab vedotin is internalised by endocytosis and thus selectively taken up by targeted cells. The vesicle containing the drug is fused with lysosomes and lysosomal cysteine proteases, particularly cathepsin B, start to break down valine-citrulline linker and MMAE is no longer bound to the antibody and is released directly into the tumor environment. Skeletal formula of brentuximab vedotin. Three to five units of MMAE are attached to the monoclonal antibody (MAB) brentuximab via the spacer para-aminobenzylcarbamate (marked green), a cathepsin-cleavable linker (Cit=citrulline, Val=valine, marked blue), and an attachment group consisting of caproic acid and maleimide (marked brown).  Clinical trials  In a 2010, clinical trial, 34% of patients with refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma achieved complete remission and another 40% had partial remission.Seattle Genetics and Millennium Report Positive Data from Pivotal Trial of Brentuximab Vedotin (SGN-35) in Relapsed or Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma at 2010 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) (Corporate Press Release) Tumor reductions were achieved in 94% of patients. In ALCL, 87% of patients had tumors shrink at least 50% and 97% of patients had some tumor shrinkage. Reports in 2013, showed interim results from a Phase II, open-label, single- arm study designed to evaluate the antitumor activity of brentuximab vedotin in relapsed or refractory CD30-positive NHL, including B-cell neoplasms. These results demonstrated that single-agent brentuximab vedotin induced a 42% objective response rate and manageable safety profile among advanced diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients. A phase III trial funded by Millennium Pharmaceuticals compared ABVD (a combination of the chemotherapy drugs doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) versus A+AVD (a combination of brentuximab vedotin plus AVD, or doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) for treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma and found substituting brentuximab vedotin for bleomycin has both improved efficacy and lowered toxicity. A previously completed phase I study demonstrated that a greater number of patients experienced pulmonary toxicity with brentuximab vedotin-ABVD than with ABVD alone. Pulmonary fibrosis is a classical adverse effect of bleomycin; however, the incidence of pulmonary fibrosis in the brentuximab vedotin-ABVD arm was higher than the expected historical rate with ABVD alone. Overall, 24 out of 25 patients treated with brentuximab vedotin and AVD achieved complete remission. Brentuximab vedotin is also being investigated as a substitute for vincristine (another mitotic inhibitor which prevents tubulin polymerization) in patients with being treated with CHOP (a combination of cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone or prednisolone) for a non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A phase III clinical trial is currently comparing the two combination therapies (CHOP and CHP-brentuximab vedotin) with estimated completion in December 2017. The ECHELON-1 phase 3 trial compared brentuximab vedotin with bleomycin both in combination with adriamycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (AVD) chemotherapy as a firstline treatment for advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma.  Serious adverse events  Brentuximab vedotin was studied as monotherapy in 160 patients in two phase II trials. Across both trials, the most common adverse reactions (‚â•20%), regardless of causality, were chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (a progressive, enduring and often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs), neutropenia (an immune system impairment), fatigue, nausea, anemia, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, fever, rash, thrombocytopenia, cough and vomiting.  Black box warning  On January 13, 2012, the FDA announced that because brentuximab vedotin had been linked with two cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, they were requiring the addition of a black box warning to the drug label regarding this potential risk.  Interactions  Patients who are receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors concomitantly with brentuximab vedotin should be closely monitored for serious adverse events.

It combines the speed of grinding or honing with the precision of lapping. It has also been known under the terms high speed lapping and high precision grinding.  Origin of term  thumbA schematic of a flat honing machine: 1\\\\. Carrier plate 2\\\\. Workpiece 3\\\\. Outer ring 4\\\\. Driven inner ring 5\\\\. Grinding wheel The term is derived from honing cylinders and holes. A flat workpiece surface is processed, hence the word flat; the word honing is used because the cutting speed is low compared to grinding. A fixed abrasive is used to provide accuracy and optical appearance of the surface finish. Sometimes it is also called fine grinding or surface grinding using planetary kinematics.  History  The technology is relatively young, having appeared in the 1980s. In the industry, production lapping is being replaced by flat honing in an ever-expanding array of applications. The flat honing process allows for an equivalent quality result, but at a significant reduction in manufacturing costs per workpiece. Savings result from reduced process times and the ease of workpiece cleaning. However, more and more parts are processed directly from their blank operation (sintered, injected, punched, sawed, or similar) with highly precise tolerances and accuracy (flatness and roughness).  Method  The removal of the material is done by using geometrically undefined cutting edges (grain bound) that are held together in large working wheels with a thin layer of abrasive. The workpieces are held in toothed carriers (plastic, steel) that are driven by two horizontal pin rings. The full workpiece surface is in constant contact with an abrasive wheel. There are two different processes: Single and double sided machining. The working wheel and the carriers are driven by different relative movements between the workpiece and the abrasive wheel. The rotation of the inner pin ring against the working wheel generates the stock removal. The operation itself will be flushed continually (mostly with oil) to ensure the clean working wheel does not become contaminated with grinding sludge.  Abrasive  Most working wheels contain abrasive grains of synthetic diamond or cubic boron nitride (CBN). The grain shape, grain coating and the grain size are other important components for an optimal working process.  Bond  The bond has the task of holding the individual grains together until they become dull. Type and quantity of the binder used affects both the hardness and the abrasive properties of the working wheels. The outbreak of the abrasive grain is called self-sharpening.  Layout of flat honing wheels  Flat honing requires an exclusive wheel suitable for the type of material being processed. Flat honing wheels are available with full faced layers of abrasive although grooves of different geometry can be introduced to enhance a better removal of material. These abrasives are fixed onto a steel plate. For vitrified bonded flat honing wheels, round or hexagonal pellets are used and are fixed to the steel plate with a special adhesive. The spaces between the pellets or segments are used to reduce the contact between the workpiece and the abrasive wheel. They also cool and lubricate the process. All types of flat honing wheels can vary in grain concentration and grain size along the area of the wheel which results in an even wear over the complete wheel.  Cooling and flushing  The main task of the coolant is to aid in the dissipation of heat from removed stock. It also reduces the friction between the abrasive and the workpiece. Therefore, proper wetting, adhesion, pressure, temperature resistance, and corrosion protection are all factors when selecting a coolant. Oil (mineral or diester based) is used as the preferred cooling and flushing media. Water emulsions may also be used.  Applications  Due to the tension-free reception of loose parts in the carriers, virtually any solid material can be processed. The application range is very wide, from a soft to a very hard material (thermoplastic plastic to sapphire or ceramic). Examples are vane pump parts made of polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), ceramic insert made of SiNi, watch windows, sapphire LED wafers, bearing rings, vane pumps, gear steel, cutting knives and carbide. The surface is similar to the typical honing crosshatch, this leads to good tribological properties and fine roughness. The low subsurface damage will have a positive impact on subsequent polishing processes (CMP, etching).  References  Further reading *Modern manufacturing processes By James A.

Benson, Eugene; Conolly, L.W. (eds). London: Routledge, 2005. Like his later 1962 book The Gutenberg Galaxy, The Mechanical Bride is unique and composed of a number of short essays that can be read in any order ‚Äì what he styled the \\"mosaic approach\\" to writing a book. Each essay begins with a newspaper or magazine article or an advertisement, followed by McLuhan's analysis thereof. The analyses bear on aesthetic considerations as well as on the implications behind the imagery and text. McLuhan chose the ads and articles included in his book not only to draw attention to their symbolism and their implications for the corporate entities that created and disseminated them, but also to mull over what such advertising implies about the wider society at which it is aimed.  Summary  McLuhan is concerned by the size and the intentions of the North American culture industry. \\"Ours is the first age in which many thousands of the best-trained individual minds have made it a full-time business to get inside the collective public mind,\\" McLuhan writes in his preface to the book. He believes everyone is kept in a \\"helpless state engendered by prolonged mental rutting is the effect of many ads and much entertainment alike.\\"\\"Preface to the original edition\\" by Marshall McLuhan. The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man. Herbert Marshall McLuhan. 1951. Ginko Press, 2002. pp. v McLuhan hopes Bride can reverse this process. By using artifacts of popular culture as a means to enlighten the public, McLuhan hopes the public can consciously observe the effects of popular culture on them. McLuhan compares his method to the sailor in Edgar Allan Poe's short-story \\"A Descent into the Maelstrom.\\" The sailor, McLuhan writes, saves himself by studying the whirlpool and by co-operating with it. Likewise, the book is not interested in attacking the strong currents of advertising, radio, and the press. The book argues anger and outrage are not the proper responses to the culture industry. \\"The time for anger...is in the early stages of a new process,\\" McLuhan says, \\"the present stage is extremely advanced.\\" Amusement is the proper strategy. This is why McLuhan uses punning questions that border on silly or absurd after each visual example. On the technique of amusement McLuhan quotes Poe's sailor, when he's locked into the whirlpool's walls looking at floating objects: :\\"I must have been delirious, for I even sought amusement in speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents towards the foam below.\\" [italics original] This amusement, McLuhan argues, born \\"of his rational detachment as a spectator of his own situation,\\" saved the sailor's life. By adopting the position of Poe's sailor, readers of Bride can escape from the whirlpool of popular culture.  Origins  Marshall McLuhan's interest in the critical study of popular culture was influenced by the 1933 book Culture and Environment by F. R. Leavis (with Denys Thompson) and Wyndham Lewis' 1932 book Doom of Youth, which uses similar exhibits. During the 1940s, McLuhan regularly held lectures with slides of advertisements analysing them. He first referred to the present era as the Age of the Mechanical Bride in 1945, during a series of lectures in Windsor, Ontario. McLuhan had planned publishing these lectures and slides since before 1945.Walter Ong says \\"As long as I knew McLuhan he had been talking about publishing The Mechanical Bride\\" (). During the thirties and forties, many \\"expos√©\\" books critiquing the advertising industry were published but McLuhan's book was different. While critical, the tone of the essays was admiring at times, impressed with the skills of advertisers. Despite the influence, McLuhan was far more playful in The Mechanical Bride than Leavis was in Culture and Environment. In June 1948, McLuhan received an advance of $250 for the publication of The Folklore of Industrial Man from Vanguard Press.Marchand says $250 dollars was not \\"outrageously low for a highbrow book.\\" (). The tentative title would later become the subtitle. The title The Mechanical Bride comes from a piece by the French avant-garde artist, Marcel Duchamp, titled The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even.Theall, Donald F., The Virtual Marshall McLuhan, McGill- Queen's Press - MQUP, 2001. Cf. p.5]. The book underwent several title changes over four manuscripts before McLuhan settled on Bride. The first manuscript was titled Guide to Chaos. The following three manuscripts were titled Typhon in America, after the Ancient Greek mythological monster. The eventual title of the book reflects McLuhan's concern about the merging of sex and technology in advertising.\\"Introduction to the Fiftieth Anniversary Edition of The Mechanical Bride\\" by Philip B. Meggs, http://gingkopress.com/02-mcl/z_philip- b-meggs-mech-bride.html McLuhan was frustrated by the editorial efforts of Vanguard Press. He resisted requests to cut entries, to expand on subjects, give examples, underline a point, or generally make the book easier for readers to understand. He would verbally abuse Vanguard Press staff, accusing editors of wearing him down with editorial requests.Marchand says Evelyn Shrifte, the woman who did most of the book editing, would be a major target (). He began to suffer from severe headaches during this period, possibly products of the stress, anger, and frustration of his dealings with Vanguard. The Mechanical Bride was published in the fall of 1951. The book was well- reviewed but it was not a financial success, only selling a few hundred copies. Biographer Philip Marchand reports that after the publication, McLuhan complained of a vague \\"homosexual influence in the publishing world, that was horrified by the masculine vigor of his prose and trying to castrate his text.\\" McLuhan bought one thousand copies and sold them individually to bookshops and students. By the 1970s, hardcover first editions of The Mechanical Bride became sought after items in the rare book business.

The film is a British-German co-production, written by Alan Bleasdale, directed by Uwe Janson, and with Andrew Buchan, Brian Cox, Ken Duken, Morven Christie, Lindsay Duncan, Thomas Kretschmann and Franka Potente in the leading roles. It was shot in Cape Town, South Africa.  Plot  Laconia In September 1942, 650 nautical miles from the west coast of Africa, the German U-boat sinks the British troopship Laconia, which is en route from Cape Town to the United Kingdom. On realising that there are Italian POWs and civilians amongst the shipwrecked, who face certain death without rescue, U-boat Commander Werner Hartenstein (Duken) makes a decision that goes against the orders of German High Command. The U-boat surfaces and Hartenstein instructs his men to save as many survivors as they can. U-156 crams 200 people on board the surfaced submarine, takes another 200 in tow in four lifeboats, and tries to give relief to the remaining shipwrecked who surround the U-boat in lifeboats and small rafts. Hartenstein attempts to dive with all survivors on board and, although this puts the submarine into a crash dive, control is regained and it resurfaces. He has a Red Cross flag displayed and a message sent to the Allies to organise rescue of the survivors. The Italian prisoners are taken off U-156 by another U-boat and an Italian submarine. The British requested the Americans to look for Laconia survivors, but did not inform them of the submarine's rescue effort; when a B-24 Liberator finds the submarine, it is ordered to attack. Soon after the bomber attack, U-156 resumes her hunting duties, leaving behind the lifeboats with the British survivors to be picked up by a Vichy naval surface ship sent by Admiral D√∂nitz. While admiring Hartenstein's actions, D√∂nitz also reluctantly composes the Laconia Order to other U-boat commanders not to rescue survivors in future. The French ship arrives; one lifeboat leaves the others to make for the coast of west Africa, which it eventually reaches. One British merchant officer is injured in the American attack and remains with U-156 until it reaches port, where he is taken prisoner. D√∂nitz awards Hartenstein the Ritterkreuz and proposes to repost him to a desk job at naval command. Preferring to remain with his men, Hartenstein refuses the post and a final on screen message reports U-156s later sinking with no survivors.

Press reviews \\"These famous Partitas - that are such classical pieces - belong to the most important and difficult masterpieces any violinist can play. And when, as a violinist, as myself, one finds oneself remembering them or re-reading the scores, and when one imagines a faithful, ideal version of those pieces, one wouldn't necessarily have thought the virtuoso Marie Cantagrill - who, before her formidable Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto, had honored Wieniawski, Sarasate, Paganini and other Ravel in her previous albums - would be the one to offer us such a version. Well but...indeed yes, she does! Marie Cantagrill, with her flawless technique, gives to those sublime pages - that are so often performed as dehumanized stylistic exercises by other violinists - true life, and radiating energy.[...] In Bach - even if she perfectly masters, and respects ...\\"note to note\\" his scores, with such a precise left hand making you think of the work of a grand clockmaker, - however, never leaving out some very moderate and justified rubatos, - she adorns those pieces - thanks to her subtle bowing, from time to time voluptuous, and caressing, or also rather sharply precise and twirling - with poetic and expressive accents that can only cause emotion and arouse deep resonance in any music lover's soul. An emotion reaching its climax in the sumptuous and appealing Ciaccona. All that with an outstanding and truly artistic sense of good taste regarding this music. This CD, that has been remarkably recorded at the Saint-Serge Church in Angers by \\"Art et Musique\\", is a total success.\\" [French Musical Confederation - J.M - 2010] \\"Outstanding Marie Cantagrill ! \\"After a first \\"Romantic and virtuoso Album\\", and the very beautiful \\"R√©cital Slave\\", Marie Cantagrill brilliantly pursues her solo career.

La Maison de la radio (2013), takes us into the heart of the French Radio headquarters in Paris, finding out who inhabits the place and discovering the mysteries of its long corridors. Over the last fifteen years there have been more than 120 retrospectives or 'homages' to Philibert organised internationally including the British Film Institute (London) and the Museum of Modern Art (New York). He was one of the directors invited to nominate his favourite films in the British Film Institute's 2012 poll. He explains, in French, his motivations, his influences (including Agn√©s Varda) and the history of his career as a documentary film maker, especially the 'impermeable' frontiers between documentary and drama in an interview recorded in April 2012.

Tweedie‚Äôs compositions have appeared on Fox‚Äôs So You Think You Can Dance,So You Think You Can Dance The Bernie Mac Show, and others. Early life Tweedie's father was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and grew up in Glasgow, Scotland before moving to Richmond in 1960. His mother is from Richmond, California. He has one older sister. Living in the small, working-middle class town of Crockett, California, Tweedie grew up with Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt of the rock band Green Day, as well as Scott Holderby of pioneering heavy funk metal band Mordred. His first instrument was trumpet, which he played first chair in the school band, and it took his teacher a few years to realize he was learning the music by ear rather than reading it. This teacher noted Tweedie's aptitude and demonstrated interest in music, and made the band room available to him when he was otherwise being sent to the library for an inability to sit still. At age ten Tweedie began playing drums, picking up guitar and keys as a teenager. Tweedie served as Drum Captain for two years at Pinole Valley High School, and received a second-hand drum kit from a high school music teacher; he still plays the kick drum from this sparkly blue 1960s Ludwig kit. By the time he graduated he was playing in bands around the Bay Area. He cut his first record in 1989 at The Record Plant in Sausalito, California, drumming for Chris Loiter and the Hangouts. Professional development In 1994, Tweedie heard Joel Smith (bass and drums, Edwin Hawkins) play drums at the Kazake Lounge in the Fillmore District of San Francisco, and approached him after the gig, offering to do anything in exchange for his tutelage. For the next two years, Tweedie ferried Smith to jazz, pop and gospel gigs all over the Bay Area, serving as his roadie, absorbing everything he could. He walked away from the experience with more than music theory, but a spiritual and metaphysical commitment to time as informed by Joel Smith. To this day, Tweedie is known for his distinctive and committed drumming style. Tweedie's first forays into recording were as a teenager, on a borrowed Tascam four- track. He recorded his own and his friends' music, and received a positive response. When his band had the opportunity to record with Jim Gaines (Stevie Ray Vaughan, Huey Lewis and the News, Journey), Tweedie noted the vast contributions Gaines made with a few simple comments. This informed his ambition to produce records, to \\"make things sound how I heard in my head\\". Tweedie says: \\"I was at every single mixing session I was ever involved with, just to be there, to learn.\\" Opportunities followed, and friends Desmond Shea and Scott Stoltier offered the use of their studio, Division Hi-Fi, for Dave to produce his first full-length record for The Stolen Bibles. Another friend, Mike Busbee, became Eric Valentine's first engineer, and shared information that led to Tweedie buying his initial gear and setting up his own recording studio. Musical career As an in-demand drummer, Tweedie became a fixture of the San Francisco music scene, playing with the likes of Angelo Moore and Norwood Fisher of Fishbone, David Immergl√ºck of Counting Crows, Karl Perazzo of Santana, Les Claypool of Primus, Eric Martin of Mr. Big, Michael Manring and Alex Skolnick. In 1997, Tweedie, alongside Stephen Bradley (vocals), joined The Good Life, a band that would open for Smash Mouth in Conocti, CA and No Doubt at The Ventura Theater in 1999. When The Good Life disbanded later that year, Tweedie and Bradley continued to write songs together, pursuing a partnership that has given rise to hundreds of songs and dozens of television placements. In 2002 Tweedie and Bradley formed Chocolate O‚ÄôBrian Productions, producing records for local bands such as BLVD and tracks for international artists such as Boolfight. Their achievements include remixes for Flipsyde's \\"Someday\\" (2004) and No Doubt‚Äôs ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs My Life‚Äù (2004). Their production reel, 2004‚Äôs eponymous Chocolate O‚ÄôBrian, is available on iTunes and has been featured on various network television programs. They also performed as a live band. Dave Tweedie produced Motive for Movement, the sophomore effort from Hellcat band Static Thought. Music for film and television Since the mid-1990s, Tweedie's songwriting and multi-instrumental proficiency have been in demand: he has been called on to write fresh music for TV shows. As drummer and co-founder of the BAMMIE-Award winning group,Los Angelitos win Bay Area Music Award Los Angelitos,SF Weekly write-up: \\"Angel Heart\\" he wrote queues for CBS show Nash Bridges.Nash Bridges, Los Angelitos in Billboard Solo, he wrote a new score for Roger Corman's Velocity, a re- edited version of The Wild Ride, starring Jack Nicholson, with new footage.Velocity Worldcat. In 2006 a request came from music supervisors in Hollywood to write some music for The Bernie Mac Show, which led to work on MTV's short-lived Celebrity Rap Superstar, and finally to writing original music for Fox‚Äôs So You Think You Can Dance, where he has found professional success, as well as a dedicated fan base in the show's many online forums. Current projects Tweedie currently writes with two projects: Jet Stream,Jet Stream publisher with Stephen Bradley and Bijou Choder, a pop / dance / rap group that has found commercial success in DirecTV ads, and various TV placements such as MTV‚Äôs Paris Hilton‚Äôs New BFF. He also works with Oakland-based singer/songwriter Oona Garthwaite in their soul-rock/pop band OONA, producing, co-writing, and music directing, and playing drums live. OONA was named one of MTV2‚Äôs Bay Area Breakout Bands in August, 2009.

A right-handed batsman, Annetts scored centuries in both Tests and One Day Internationals. Career Annetts first appeared for New South Wales in the 1983/84 season, and after a couple of low scores, she made her first half- century against Australian Capital Territory in her third match before being run out on 51. Her following match brought another half century, improving slightly to 56 before being caught. In January 1985 she was selected for the Women's Cricket Association of Australia President's XI to play the touring England side, and was subsequently named in the Australia team to face New Zealand the following month. She scored 26* on her One Day International debut as Australia chased down a low New Zealand total to win by nine wickets. Her maiden ODI half-century came the following season when she made 57 runs opening the batting with Belinda Haggett against New Zealand in Wellington. Part of the 1987 Australia Women tour of the British Isles, Annetts scored her second half-century during the Third ODI against Ireland, before making a century against Surrey Women, including a 184-second-wicket partnership with Lindsay Reeler, a portent of things to come. She scored 36* and 50 in the two ODIs followed by 34 on her Test debut, a match dominated by Haggett's 126. On her second Test appearance, Annetts came in to partner Lindsay Reeler with the score on 2/37 after Denise Emerson and Belinda Haggett had fallen early. The pair put on a record wicket partnership for any wicket in Women's Test cricket history of 309 runs, with Annetts making her top score of 193, while Reeler finished on 110*. She also holds the record of highest average in Women's Test Cricket. In January 1994, she claimed her omission from the Australian team was because she was not a lesbian. The Australian Anti-Discrimination Board could not investigate the complaint as the discrimination law only protected homosexuals.

Founded in 1976 with the original emphasis on the study of the United States-Mexico borderlands region, the association has grown steadily. It now encompasses an interdisciplinary membership of scholars at more than three hundred academic, governmental institutions, and NGOs representing the Americas, Asia, Africa and Europe.UA News - University of Arizona (July 2, 2009) Rebecca Ruiz-McGill \\"UA Professor Named President-Elect of the Association for Borderlands Studies\\" - accessed: 14 January 2010 The ABS publishes an academic journal Journal of Borderlands Studies and an association newsletter La Frontera, as well as sponsoring an annual meeting. Work Contemporary issues dealt with by the ABS include regional economic integration, the emergence of new post- Communist nation states, the proliferation of ethnic conflicts, security versus openness of borders, and the need to institutionalize management of trans-boundary problems ranging from immigration to shared environmental problems to public health and economic development concerns. Given the diverse nature of borders, borderlands and boundaries, the ABS draws on a range of disciplines and perspectives. Contributing fields include geography, political science, history, anthropology, demography, sociology, psychology, linguistics, security and technology studies, public administration and public policy. The association maintains relations with institutions and associations with similar interests in the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia, as well as acting as an important resource for continued research. In conjunction with the Centre for International Borders Research (Queens University, Belfast, UK) the ABS has compiled a comprehensive bibliography of more than 1,000 published works related to state borders, border regions, borderlands, cross-border co- operation and trans-national governance.http://www.qub.ac.uk/research- centres/CentreforInternationalBordersResearch/ABS-CIBRBibliography/ More region-specific associations interested in international border areas include: the Nijmegen Center for Border Research, based at Radboud University in the Netherlands; the International Boundaries Research Unit (IBRU) from Durham University, UK; the African Borderlands Research Network; the Latin American Network Information Center; and the Border Information and Outreach Service. The ABS seeks to maintain a listing of these and other border-related resources on its website. Journal of Borderlands Studies The primary publication of the ABS, the Journal of Borderlands Studies, presents research on border issues and has been published three times yearly since its inception in 1986. It is recognized as a key academic forum and leader in the study of borderlands phenomena.Journal of Borderlands Studies, vol. 24, no. 1 (2009) p. 1 The journal's editors are Emmanuel Brunet Jailly, Martin van der Velde and Henk van Houtum. It is peer-reviewed and encourages the submission of articles from disciplines across the humanities and social sciences as well as business and law. Beginning with JBS Volume 26 for 2011, the Association for Borderlands Studies announced that the journal was to be published in the United Kingdom by Routledge Journals, Taylor & Francis Group, Informa UK Limited. Just prior to that the ABS had entered into a contract with EBSCO to distribute the journal through its service, but all members of the ABS would continue to receive subscriptions to the journal as part of their annual membership. The journal is indexed in the Hispanic American Periodicals Index and searchable by members of the ABS (behind password protected web page). The ABS also publishes an association newsletter La Frontera that reports on ABS meetings, professional news, and other information of interest. The newsletter is published semi-annually and all ABS members receive a subscription. Annual meeting The ABS sponsors an annual meeting, which provides a forum for a wide range of topics on border regions around the world. The association's annual meeting is held in April of every year, within the yearly Conference of the Western Social Science Association. The ABS also co-sponsors other meetings on border topics. During the annual meeting, the ABS nominates selected publications dealing with borders to receive its annual Book Award.

Because of its toxicity, it cannot be used as a drug itself; instead, it is linked to a monoclonal antibody (MAB) which directs it to the cancer cells. In International Nonproprietary Names for MMAE-MAB-conjugates, the name vedotin refers to MMAE plus its linking structure to the antibody.Statement on a nonproprietary name adopted by the USAN Council: Vedotin It is a potent antimitotic drug derived from peptides occurring in marine shell-less mollusc Dolabella auricularia called dolastatins which show potent activity in preclinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, against a range of lymphomas, leukemia and solid tumors. These drugs show potency of up to 200 times that of vinblastine, another antimitotic drug used for Hodgkin lymphoma as well as other types of cancer. MMAE is actually desmethyl-auristatin E; that is, the N-terminal amino group has only one methyl substituent instead of two as in auristatin E itself. Mechanism of action Monomethyl auristatin E is an antimitotic agent which inhibits cell division by blocking the polymerisation of tubulin. The linker to the monoclonal antibody is stable in extracellular fluid, but is cleaved by cathepsin once the conjugate has entered a tumour cell, thus activating the antimitotic mechanism.Seattle Genetics: Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) :Structure of a MMAE-MAB-conjugate. The linker, consisting of the amino acids valine (Val) and citrulline (Cit), is cleaved by cathepsin inside tumour cells. The spacer (para-aminobenzylcarbamate) is marked green, the cathepsin- cleavable linker is blue, and the attachment group (consisting of maleimide and caproic acid) is brown.

Early life Jones was born in England and moved with her mother to Melbourne, Australia when she was three months old. Her father, a West Indian, stayed back in England and she did not meet him until the age of 16. However, he had a big influence on her early life, particularly in attracting her to cricket. She was introduced to cricket by her high school geography teacher (the father of Australian test player Peter Handscomb). Playing career A right-handed batswoman and occasional right- arm medium pace bowler, she played 5 Test matches for Australia between 1998 and 2003, scoring 251 runs, highlighted by a 131 on debut against England in August 1998. Jones was the 134th woman to play Test cricket for Australia. She has also played 61 One Day Internationals for Australia, scoring 1028 runs with an average in the low-twenties. Jones played limited overs cricket in England for the now defunct Lancashire and Cheshire Women cricket team between 1994 and 1997 and the Surrey County women's cricket team between 2003 and 2004. She played 122 games for the Victorian Spirit in the Australian Women's National Cricket League, and then five Women's Twenty20 cricket games for the Tasmanian Roar. Commentary career Cricket Australia put Jones' name forward in 2007 to commentate on the women's Twenty20 international, covered by Australia's Channel 9. Since then, Jones has commentated on women's internationals covered by Channel 9, as well as providing commentary for men's and women's games on ABC Radio. In 2015, Jones was announced as one of four female commentators to commentate on the 2015 Indian Premier League. Later in 2015, Jones joined the Channel 10 coverage of inaugural season of the Women's Big Bash League, and also provided boundary commentary during the 2015-16 Big Bash League, along with boundary commentary for Pakistan Super League 2017. She also lent her voice to the Ashes Cricket 17 game. In May 2018, she signed with Fox Sports. Personal life Outside of cricket, Jones works for a sports management company. Jones has worked as an Ambassador with Australian charity, Red Dust, which promotes health initiatives in remote Aboriginal communities. And also on Australia Day 2019, Jones was appointed an OAM.

The configuration consists of a one-piece axle (solid front axle), to the ends of which the steerable front wheels are mounted. The axle receives its vertical and transverse support from a transverse leaf spring (leaf springs were often used for support in more than one direction), and its longitudinal support from fore-aft links sometimes called \\"radius rods\\" which are attached (via pivots) to the ends of the axle at their forward end and to the sides of the chassis (again via pivots) at their aft end. The ends of the transverse leaf spring can either tie to the top of the rods, or to the top of the solid axle. The transverse leaf spring is attached at its center to the center of the chassis's front cross member. Advantages and disadvantages In addition to simplicity lightness and compact shape, at least in some directions, since only the small end of the spring was attached to the axle near the wheel, it gave low unsprung weight. In addition to its contribution to ride and handling, this reduced wheel bearing loads and therefore allowed smaller cheaper bearings. The control of wheel motion was inferior to that of other suspension designs, even those of the first half of the 20th century. This was not helped by the use of the leaf spring to provide lateral location for the axle by connecting it to both ends of the spring by almost horizontal shackles, which resulted in somewhat peculiar lateral movement, with quite significant bump-steer. Vertical shackles, as on a more typical fore and aft leaf spring, would have failed to provide lateral control. Some variants used a plain pivot at one end of the axle and a near-vertical shackle at the other. The wheel hub assemblies (sometimes known as steering knuckles) carry steering arms, the ends of which are linked by a tie or track rod. This is adjustable to set the toe angle correctly, and this will remain correct despite suspension movement. The problem then was that the drag link, conveying steering motion from the steering box to one steering arm, is approximately the same length as the spring. Because the spring changes its radius of curvature as it is deflected, the movement of one end would approximate that of a pivoted lever of lesser length than half of the spring, so whether the pivoted end was at the same side of the vehicle as the steering box, or otherwise, the drag link was always moving through a different arc to that of the axle ends and hub, causing bump steer, and noticeable difference in steering characteristics between turns to the left or to the right. The modern Corvette leaf spring design does not use the spring for location.

It dates approximately to the 8th century, but survives only in manuscripts of a much later date. It describes the fictional history of the D√©isi, a group that had gained political power in parts of Ireland during the Early Middle Ages. Part of the text's purpose is to provide the kings of the D√©isi ‚Äì historically the descendants of unlanded vassals to other tribes ‚Äì with a mythical noble origin as the heirs to a dynasty expelled from Tara. The story survives in two different Old Irish versions, which contain essentially the same narrative supplemented by singular additions, including tangential episodes, lists of names, and poetry. After violently recovering his niece from the depredations of the king's son of Tara, √ìengus Ga√≠b√∫aibthech and his followers are dispossessed by the king and sent to wander Ireland. They tarry in Leinster for a period, but are eventually expelled from that kingdom as well. When military prowess fails them, they are able to forge a home for themselves through cunning and magic in Munster against the Osraige. As with much early Irish literature, the digressive onomastic and genealogical material is of great value. In particular, one passage describes a D√©isi branch settling in Britain and founding the Kingdom of Dyfed, a matter of some interest in the context of early Irish migrations to Britain. Versions and manuscripts The story survives in an earlier and a later version, which Kuno Meyer dubbed \\"A\\" and \\"B\\".Meyer, pp. 102‚Äì103. The A version dates to the 8th century, but exists only in manuscripts of a significantly later date.Meyer, p. 102. It survives complete in Laud MS 610 and Rawlinson MS 502, and in fragmentary form in the Book of U√≠ Maine and the Liber Flavus Fergusiorum.Hull 1954, p. 266. Of the complete copies, Meyer notes that the Rawlinson text contains fewer errors, but that Laud preserves more archaic spelling. The B version survives in some form in three manuscripts. The oldest of these is a fragment contained in the Book of the Dun Cow; this copy is complemented by the later two, found in H. 3. 17 and H. 2. 5, allowing for reconstruction of the text.Meyer, p. 103. The H. 2. 5 copy further contains several poems absent from the other manuscripts. The title is recorded variously in the manuscripts. Rawlinson contains Tairired na n'D√©ssi, or The Journeying of the D√©isi.Meyer, p. 102 and notes. Laud records it as De causis torche n'D√©ssi/acuis toirge na n'D√©ssi. The word torche/toirge is obscure, but Meyer associates it with \\"expedition\\". The B manuscripts all contain some reference to the injury visited upon Cormac mac Airt, one of the characters: the Book of the Dun Cow has Tucait innarba na n'D√©si im Mumain & aided Cormaic, H. 3. 17 has C√≥echad Cormaic i Temraig, and H. 2. 5 has Tucaid ch√°etcha Cormaic do Aengus Gaibuaibtheach & aigeag Ceallaig & fotha indarbtha na nDeissi do Muig Breag. Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville's Catalogue further lists two possibly related titles: Longes Eithne Uathaige and Tochomlad na nD√©si a Temraig.d'Arbois de Jubainville, p. 171, 263. However, it is unknown to which version, if either, these refer. Background The term D√©isi initially designated various subject peoples owing tribute to landowning tribes. It derives from the Old Irish d√©is, meaning \\"client(s)\\" or \\"vassalry\\"; this distinguishes it from other Irish ethnonyms that derive from ancestors' personal names.Thornton, p. 121. The Expulsion of the D√©isi concerns one such group, the D√©isi Muman of Munster, who lived primarily in the present-day counties of Waterford and Tipperary and were subject to the E√≥ganachta dynasty. Over time, the D√©isi Muman grew in power, and were prominent enough to found their own local kingdom at a fairly early date. The various groups designated D√©isi were not originally closely related, but by the mid-8th century, following the rise of the D√©isi Muman, they came to be seen as a genealogically linked whole, descended from the same noble ancestors. The Explulsion of the D√©isi gives a mythical origin narrative for the then powerful D√©isi Muman and associated groups.Thornton, pp. 121‚Äì123. The Expulsion of the D√©isi was long considered a more or less historically accurate account of a mass displacement of the D√©isi and their subsequent settlement on the southwestern coast of Ireland and elsewhere. This was later disputed by scholars such as John MacNeill, Patrick C. Power, T. F. O'Rahilly, and S√©amus Pender, who regard it as late fiction.Hull 1959, p. 14. Narrative Both versions describe the adventures of the D√©isi forefathers in the time of Cormac mac Airt, King of Tara. They follow the same narrative track, but both contain sections that break from the main narrative and tell individual, largely unrelated stories about the D√©isi and their contemporaries. A contains episodes not in B, and vice versa. A version In the A version, the D√©isi are led by the four sons of Artchorp: Brecc, √ìengus Ga√≠b√∫aibthech (√ìengus of the Dread Spear), Eochaid Allmuir (Eochaid the Foreigner), and Forad. Forad's daughter Forach is raped and kidnapped by Conn (elsewhere Cellach), the \\"wanton son\\" of Cormac maic Airt. √ìengus, who leads a band of fifty men, goes to Tara to rescue her. When Conn refuses to release the girl, √ìengus runs him through with his \\"dread spear\\", which blinds Cormac in one eye in the process. Because the law forbids a high king to have a physical blemish, Cormac must retire to a r√°th outside Tara, and defer the kingship to his son Cairbre Lifechair. Undeterred, Cormac raises his forces against the D√©isi and expels them from Tara. √ìengus, together with his brother Brecc's sons Russ and Eogan, engages the king in seven battles. After forty days √ìengus succeeds Brecc as king of the D√©isi, but steps down due to \\"murmurs\\" about his consolidation of the power of both champion and king. Cormac will not give the D√©isi a fair fight, and pushes them into Leinster, where the local ruler Fiachu Bacceda drives the U√≠ Bairrche from their land and gives it to the D√©isi. They remain there for three decades.Meyer, pp. 104‚Äì109 (sect. 1‚Äì6). Eventually the U√≠ Bairrche warrior Eochu Guinech ejects the D√©isi and they are compelled to move further south into Ard Ladrann, thereafter known as the \\"Land of the Wandering Host\\". Section 8 tells the story of Ethne the Dread, daughter of then King of Leinster Crimthann mac √ânnai (d. 483) and an eventual fosterling of the D√©isi. At her birth a druid prophesies that under Ethne her mother's kindred will seize what will be their homeland; hearing this her parents feed her the flesh of young boys to accelerate her growth. Meanwhile, Cormac continues to harass √ìengus and the D√©isi, stirring up discord among their warriors and leaders. He sends a peace offer to Russ and Eogan, the sons of Brecc, offering them absolution and land if they return to his service. √ìengus promises them yet more land and preeminence over his children for them to remain.Meyer, pp. 108‚Äì115 (sect. 7‚Äì12). When Crimthann mac √ânnai dies, his sons turn on the D√©isi, driving them out of Leinster altogether. They settle briefly in Osraige, but the king burns down their houses, leaving them homeless and forced to wander west into Munster. They receive some relief when √ìengus mac Nad Fro√≠ch (d. 489), King of Munster, proposes to marry Ethne the Dread, who has been traveling with the D√©isi. He offers to grant her any three demands as the dowry. Ethne requests land for her mother's kindred, fulfilling her prophecy; she also requests that Osraige be cleared of its inhabitants and given to the D√©isi, and that her people be as free as the \\"three Eoganacht of Munster\\". √ìengus grants her wishes, but the D√©isi are unable to oust the residents of Osraige. With the help of Lugaid Laigde Cosc, the seer-judge of the Corcu Lo√≠gde and Cashel, they devise a trick: learning of a prophecy that whichever side draws first blood the next day will be routed, the D√©isi druids transform one of their men into a red cow. The men of Osraige kill the cow, thereby sealing their fate; they are pushed across the Lingaun River, which thereafter serves as the border between the D√©isi and Osraige. The D√©isi divide up their land, and most of the remainder of the text lists names of individual D√©isi and septs descended from them.Meyer, pp. 114‚Äì131 (sect. 13‚Äì23). B version The B version contains the same basic narrative, with significant additions and subtractions. It was edited (Irish only) by Meyer in Anecdd. I,Kuno Meyer, ed., Tucait indarba na nD√©ssi (Expulsion of the D√©ssi), in Anecdota from Irish Manuscripts, vol. i. (1907), pp.15-24 with TCD MS 1316 (olim H. 2.15a), pp. 67a-68b (H text) as base, with footnoted readings from MS 1336 (olim H. 3.17), col. 720b-723a (h text). It likewise begins with the kidnapping of Forach by Cormac's son (here Cellach), but in this version √ìengus is initially too busy avenging family insults with his famous spear to save her. It is only after he is rebuked for his dithering by a woman ‚Äì whom he kills ‚Äì that he rescues Forach, killing Cellach and blinding Cormac in the process. The story continues with the D√©isi's expulsion from Tara, their sojourn in Leinster, and their patriation in Munster following the marriage arrangement between Ethne the Dread and √ìengus mac Nad Fro√≠ch. Here, however, aid in exploiting the prophecy that ultimately allows them to displace the men of Osraige comes not from a seer-judge, but from the \\"haughty daughter\\" of the Osraige druid who delivers the prognostication.This Is The Cause Of The Expulsion Of The D√©ssi To Munster And The Violent Death Of Cormac, sect. 1‚Äì15. Of the material not in the A version, by far the most substantial is in a lengthy tangential episode dealing with the birth and childhood of √ìengus' foster son Corc Duibne, progenitor of the Corcu Duibne, whose name is merely mentioned in A. Corc and his brother are born of incest to Coirpre M√∫se and Duihind, children of the king of Munster Conaire C√≥em, and their nativity brings famine to the land. The people want them immolated, but Corc is saved by a druid and his wife who take him to an offshore island so that his curse is removed from Ireland. The druid's wife, Bo√≠, performs purification rituals that ultimately transfer Corc's curse to an otherworldy white cow, allowing him to return to his family. Eventually he serves as hostage in Cormac mac Airt's court, where he is fostered by √ìengus; he accompanies his foster father when he is expelled from Tara. He tries to convince the wandering D√©isi to settle on the island of his rearing, and stays there when the D√©isi opt to move on to Cashel.This Is The Cause Of The Expulsion Of The D√©ssi To Munster And The Violent Death Of Cormac, sect. 1‚Äì12. The variant text MS 1336 (olim H. 3.17) occurs with the different title, C√≥ecad Cormaic i Temraig (Blinding of Cormac at Tara); and this text is also postscripted by a tract which alleges that the Crimall, the spear in the age of Cormac, was also the same weapon as the L√∫in of Celtchar and the spear of Lugh.Arbois de Jubainville, Essai d'un catalogue, p.90 Dyfed Section 11 of A describes Eochaid son of Artchorp traveling oversea with his descendants and settling in Demed (Demetia, later known as Dyfed in Wales). From Eochaid and his descendants springs the line of kings of Dyfed, whose descent is given down to \\"Tualodor mac R√≠gin\\" (Tudor map Regin).Meyer, pp. 112‚Äì113. This genealogy has much correspondence with pedigrees in Welsh sources, namely the Harleian genealogies and the later genealogies from Jesus College MS 20. The Harleian records show the same names from Tudor back to the figure Triphun (Triffyn Farfog), given in Expulsion as Eochaid's great- grandson. However, Harleian gives an entirely different pedigree for Triphun himself, tracing his descent back to the Roman Emperor Constantine I.Harleian genealogy 2. This could be an attempt by later genealogists to give a more illustrious pedigree to Dyfed's kingly line, or possibly to obscure its Irish origins. However, it could be that Harleian preserves the older and more accurate version, and that the Expulsion version is a later textual corruption. Regardless, there is indeed evidence of early Irish presence in Dyfed and elsewhere in Britain. Ogham inscriptions in an early form of Irish have been found in Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire.Charles-Williams, p. 163 and notes. Additionally, later literary sources from both sides of the Irish Sea discuss the presence of southern Irish peoples in Britain. The 9th-century Historia Brittonum, for instance, refers to the U√≠ Liath√°in being active in Dyfed until they were pushed out by Cunedda and his sons (fl. mid-5th century).Historia Brittonum, ch. 14.

It was founded in 1886 in Seesen and, today, has about 16,000 members in some 90 branches.  History  The Harz Club was founded on 8 August 1886 in Seesen. The railway director, Albert Schneider, was its first chairman. One of the co-founders was Carl Reu√ü. Its first task was to open up the Harz to walkers and tourists. Later, numerous local history groups were started and it took on the maintenance of Harz traditions. Nature conservation was added to its articles as an important aim in 1907. Before the outbreak of the Second World War membership stood at almost 20,000 in 120 branches. Following the division of the Harz, the development of the Harz Nature Park became the priority within the western zone. In East Germany the Harz Club was banned as an organisation, similar functions were entrusted to the subordinate levels of the Cultural Association of the GDR. After German reunification over 40 branches were founded in the Harz region of the new federal states of Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. In 1994 the club's name was changed into the Local History, Walking and Nature Conservation Association (Heimat-, Wander- und Naturschutzbund). Its main chairman is Michael Ermrich, chief executive of the district of Harz. The Harz Club maintains an office in Clausthal- Zellerfeld and is a member of the Federation of German Mountain and Walking Clubs (Verband Deutscher Gebirgs- und Wandervereine).  Tasks  The Harz Club sets itself the following tasks: * Nature conservation and preservation of the countryside * Promotion of walking; guided walks * Publication of walking maps and walking information * Maintenance of outdoor walking facilities (benches, huts, etc.) * Signing of walking trails * Local history: customs, traditional costume, dialects, folk music, yodelling * Youth work * Publication of the local history and members magazine Der Harz * Promotion of local history research and archiving * Preservation of cultural objects (loca history booths, cultural monuments in the countryside) * Training courses and workshops * Advertising of Harz local history and public relations  Walking hostels  The Harz Club maintains four walking hostels in the Harz with overnight accommodation for families and groups in: * Wildemann * Bad Lauterberg ‚Äì L√∂nsweg 12 * Torfhaus ‚Äì Goetheweg * Sonnenberg  See also  * Harzer Hexenstieg * Harzer Wandernadel ‚Äî hiking network.

TiME is a relatively low-cost, outer-planet mission designed to measure the organic constituents on Titan and would have performed the first nautical exploration of an extraterrestrial sea, analyze its nature and, possibly, observe its shoreline. As a Discovery-class mission it was designed to be cost-capped at US$425 million, not counting launch vehicle funding. It was proposed to NASA in 2009 by Proxemy Research as a scout-like pioneering mission, originally as part of NASA's Discovery Program. The TiME mission design reached the finalist stage during that Discovery mission selection, but was not selected, and despite attempts in the U.S. Senate failed to get earmark funding in 2013.  Discovery-class finalist  TiME was one of three Discovery Mission finalists that received US$3 million in May 2011 to develop a detailed concept study. The other two missions were InSight and Comet Hopper. After a review in mid-2012, NASA announced in August 2012 the selection of the InSight mission to Mars. Specifically, with launch specified prior to the end of 2025, TiME's arrival would have been in the mid-2030s, during northern winter. This means the seas, near Titan's north pole, are in darkness and direct-to-Earth communication is impossible.1Dragonfly: A Rotorcraft Lander Concept for Scientific Exploration at Titan (PDF).

Missions to land in Titan's lakes or seas were also considered by the Solar System Decadal Survey. Additionally, the flagship Titan Saturn System Mission, which was proposed in 2009 for launch in the 2020s, included a short-lived battery-powered lake lander. Opportunities for launch are transient; the next opportunity is in 2023‚Äì2024, the last chance in this generation.Titan Mare Explorer: TiME for Titan. (PDF) Lunar and Planetary Institute (2012).  History  The discovery on 22 July 2006 of lakes and seas in Titan's northern hemisphere confirmed the hypothesis that liquid hydrocarbons exist on it. In addition, previous observations of southern polar storms and new observations of storms in the equatorial region provide evidence of active methane-generating processes, possibly cryovolcanic features from the interior of Titan. Most of Titan goes centuries without seeing any rain, but precipitation is expected to be much more frequent at the poles. It is thought that Titan's methane cycle is analogous to Earth's hydrologic cycle, with meteorological working fluid existing as rain, clouds, rivers and lakes. TiME would directly discern the methane cycle of Titan and help understand its similarities and differences to the hydrologic cycle on Earth. If NASA had selected TiME, Ellen Stofan‚Äîa member of the Cassini radar team and the current Chief Scientist of NASA‚Äîwould lead the mission as principal investigator, whereas the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) would manage the mission. Lockheed Martin would build the TiME capsule, with scientific instruments provided by APL, Goddard Space Flight Center and Malin Space Science Systems.  Target  Comparison of Ligeia's size (left) with Lake Superior on Earth (right) TiME's launch would have been with an Atlas V 411 rocket during 2016 and arriving to Titan in 2023. The target lake is Ligeia Mare (78¬∞N, 250¬∞W). It is one of the largest lakes of Titan identified to date, with a surface area of about ~100,000 km2. The backup target is Kraken Mare.  Science objectives  The Titan Mare Explorer would undergo a 7-year simple interplanetary cruise with no flyby science. Some science measurements would be made during entry and descent, but data transmissions would begin only after splashdown. The science objectives of the mission are: #Determine the chemistry of a Titan sea. Instruments: Mass Spectrometer (MS), Meteorology and Physical Properties Package (MP3). #Determine the depth of a Titan sea. Instrument: Meteorology and Physical Properties Package (Sonar) (MP3). #Constrain marine processes on Titan. Instrument: Meteorology and Physical Properties Package (MP3), Descent and surface cameras. #Determine how the local meteorology over the sea varies on diurnal timescales. Instrument: Meteorology and Physical Properties Package (MP3), cameras. #Characterize the atmosphere above the sea. Instrument: Meteorology and Physical Properties Package (MP3), cameras. Malin Space Science Systems, which builds and operates camera systems for spacecraft, signed an early development contract with NASA to conduct preliminary design studies. There would be two cameras. One would take pictures during the descent to the surface of Ligeia Mare, and the other would take pictures after landing. A Meteorology and Physical Properties Package (MP3) would be built by the Applied Physics Laboratory. This instrument package would measure wind speed and direction, methane humidity, pressure and temperature above the 'waterline', and turbidity, sea temperature, speed of sound and dielectric properties below the surface. A sonar would measure the sea depth. Acoustic propagation simulations were performed and sonar transducers were tested at liquid-nitrogen temperatures to characterize their performance at Titan conditions.  Power source  Titan in front of Dione and Saturn Titan's thick atmosphere and the weak sunlight at Titan's distance from the Sun rules out the use of solar panels.Huygens Probe Sheds New Light on Titan. Charles Choi, Space.com. 21 January 2005. Quote: \\"Little sunlit penetrates the dense hydrocarbon atmosphere.\\" Had it been selected by NASA, the TiME lander would have been the test flight of the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG), which is a prototype meant to provide availability of long-lived power supplies for landed networks and other planetary missions. For this mission, it would be used in two environments: deep space and non-terrestrial atmosphere. The ASRG is a radioisotope power system using Stirling power conversion technology and is expected to generate 140‚Äì160 W of electrical power; that is four times more efficient than RTGs currently in use. Its mass is 28 kg and will have a nominal lifetime of 14 years. Though it continues ASRG research,Sterling Research Laboratory / Thermal Energy Conversion NASA has since cancelled the Lockheed contract that would have readied an ASRG for a 2016 launch, and has decided to rely on existing MMRTG radioisotope power systems for long-range probes. ;Specifications: *‚â•14 year lifetime *Nominal power: 140 W *Mass ~ 28 kg *System efficiency: ~ 30% *Two GPHS modules *Uses 0.8 kg plutonium-238 The capsule would not need propulsion: the wind and possible tidal currents are expected to push this buoyant craft around the sea for months.  Communications  The vehicle would have communicated directly with Earth and, in principle, it could be possible to maintain intermittent contact for several years after arrival: Earth finally goes below the horizon as seen from Ligeia in 2026. It will not have a line of sight to Earth to beam back more data until 2035.  Surface conditions  Models suggested that waves on Ligeia Mare do not normally exceed during the intended season of the TiME mission and occasionally might reach just over in the course of a few months. Simulations were performed to evaluate the capsule's response to the waves and possible beaching on the shore. The capsule is expected to drift on the surface of the sea at 0.1 m/s, pushed by currents and wind with typical speeds of 0.5 m/s, and not exceeding 1.3 m/s (4.2 feet/second). The probe would not be equipped with propulsion, and while its motion cannot be controlled, knowledge of its successive locations could be used to optimize scientific return, such as lake depth, temperature variations and shore imaging. Some proposed location techniques are measurement of Doppler shift, Sun height measurement, and Very Long Baseline Interferometry.  Potential habitability  The chance to discover a form of life with a different biochemistry than Earth has led some researchers to consider Titan the most important world on which to search for extraterrestrial life. A few scientists hypothesize that if the hydrocarbon chemistry on Titan crossed the threshold from inanimate matter to some form of life, it would be difficult to detect. Moreover, because Titan is so cold, the amount of energy available for building complex biochemical structures is limited, and any water-based life would freeze without a heat source. However, some scientists have suggested that hypothetical life forms may be able to exist in a methane-based solvent. Ellen Stofan, TiME's Principal Investigator, thinks that life as we know it is not viable in Titan's seas, but stated that \\"there will be chemistry in the seas that may give us insight into how organic systems progress toward life.\\"  Similar mission concepts  *Although no lander mission is currently funded to explore the lakes of Titan, the scientific interest is growing. A researcher at NASA has proposed that if TiME was to be launched, a logical follow-on mission would be a lake submersible called Titan Submarine. *A battery-powered lake lander was considered as an element of the Titan Saturn System Mission (TSSM) Flagship study, using a Saturn orbiter as a relay. A number of lake- lander variants were briefly considered in the 2010 NASA Planetary Science Decadal Survey. *A lake capsule was suggested in Europe in the 2012 EPSC meeting; it is called Titan Lake In-situ Sampling Propelled Explorer (TALISE). The major difference would be a propulsion system, possibly using Archimedes screws to function in muddy as well as liquid environments. This effort was only a brief concept study, however.

It is the region of open sea beyond the edge of the continental shelf and includes 65% of the ocean‚Äôs completely open water. The oceanic zone has a wide array of undersea terrain, including crevices that are often deeper than Mount Everest, as well as deep-sea volcanoes and ocean basins. While it is often difficult for life to sustain itself in this type of environment, many species have adapted and do thrive in the oceanic zone. There are four ocean zones: the Sunlight zone, the Twilight zone, the Midnight zone, and the Abyssal zone. Sub zones The Mesopelagic (disphotic) zone, which is where only small amounts of light penetrate, lies below the Epipelagic zone. This zone is often referred to as the \\"Twilight Zone\\" due to its scarce amount of light. Temperatures in the Mesopelagic zone range from . The pressure is higher here, it can be up to and increases with depth.\\"NatureWorks.\\" New Hampshire Public Television - Engage. Connect. Celebrate. Web. 27 Oct. 2009 54% of the ocean lies in the Bathypelagic (aphotic) zone into which no light penetrates. This is also called the midnight zone and the deep ocean. Due to the complete lack of sunlight, photosynthesis cannot occur and the only light source is bioluminescence. Water pressure is very intense and the temperatures are near freezing (range ). Marine life Oceanographers have divided the ocean into zones based on how far light reaches. All of the light zones can be found in the oceanic zone. The epipelagic zone is the one closest to the surface and is the best lit. It extends to 100 meters and contains both phytoplankton and zooplankton that can support larger organisms like marine mammals and some types of fish. Past 100 meters, not enough light penetrates the water to support life, and no plant life exists. There are creatures, however, which thrive around hydrothermal vents, or geysers located on the ocean floor that expel superheated water that is rich in minerals.The University of Delaware Marine Graduate School. \\"Hydrothermal Vents.\\" Voyage to the Deep. The University of Delaware, 2000. Web. 27 Oct. 2009. These organisms feed off of chemosynthetic bacteria, which use the superheated water and chemicals from the hydrothermal vents to create energy in place of photosynthesis. The existence of these bacteria allow creatures like squids, hatchet fish, octopuses, tube worms, giant clams, spider crabs and other organisms to survive.Knight, J.D. (1997) Sea and Sky 25 Oct. 2009. Due to the total darkness in the zones past the epipelagic zone, many organisms that survive in the deep oceans do not have eyes, and other organisms make their own light with bioluminescence. Often the light is blue-green in color, because many marine organisms are sensitive to blue light. Two chemicals, luciferin, and luciferase that react with one another to create a soft glow. The process by which bioluminescence is created is very similar to what happens when a glow stick is broken. Deep-sea organisms use bioluminescence for everything from luring prey to navigation. Animals such as fish, whales, and sharks are found in the oceanic zone.

His highly contested reign saw the temporary end of the independent Yemeni state. Contest for San'a Al-Muhsin bin Ahmad was a Sayyid from Shaharah, a stronghold north of the capital San'a, and he was therefore also known as ash-Shahari. He was a 15th-generation descendant of the imam al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar bin Yahya (d. 1298).http://www.almajalis.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=25&t;=2632 (in Arabic); http://www.izbacf.org/page_display.php?book_id=37&page;_num=66 (in Arabic). The line of descent is al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar - Ibrahim - Muhammad - Izz ad-Din - Abdallah - Ahmad - Izz ad-Din - Nahshal - al-Baqir - Abd ar-Rahim - Salah - al-Husayn - al-Hasan - Muhammad - Ahmad - al-Mutawakkil al-Muhsin. Al- Muhsin lived in a time of great political turbulence in Yemen. Ottoman troops intervened in highland Yemen in 1849 but then withdrew, leaving the remains of the Zaidi state to its own devices up to 1872. Several contenders for the Zaidi imamate arose in the wake of this event: al-Mansur Ahmad (1849‚Äì1853), al-Hadi Ghalib (1851‚Äì1852), al-Mansur Muhammad (1853‚Äì1890), and al-Mansur al- Husayn III (1859‚Äì1863).As listed in Ayman Fu'ad Sayyid, Masadir tarikh al- Yaman fial 'asr al-islami. Al Qahira 1974, p. 415. The various imams were locally based and only held power for brief terms in San'a itself. Al-Muhsin claimed the imamate in 1855, and again in 1857, under the name al-Mutawakkil al-Muhsin. It was only in 1860, however, that the tribes close to San'a heeded his claim; the tribesmen feared the growing power of the Isma'ili Makramah polity, which was heretic from the Zaidi point of view.Yehuda Nini, The Jews of the Yemen 1800-1914. Harwood 1991, p. 49. In the same year 1860, the inhabitants of San'a, tired of the infighting, issued a proclamation that they would look after their own affairs. A shaykh called Muhsin Mu'id (d. 1881) was made governor of the city. He established contacts with Imam al-Mutawakkil al- Muhsin, who established his residence in the fort of Dhu Marmar and struck coins. In 1867 the imam fell out with Governor Muhsin Mu'id and entered San'a by force, but was unable to remain there.The sequence of events is somewhat unclear; according to Yehuda Nini, 1991, p. 54, al-Mutawakkil al-Muhsin probably besieged San'a in 1865, after Muhsin Mu'id had invited the pretender- imam al-Husayn bin Ahmad. In the end, the power of the latter was eliminated by al-Mutawakkil. In the next year, an agreement was made whereby al- Mutawakkil al-Muhsin was mentioned in the Friday prayer, leaving administration largely in the hands of the governor. In 1868, the imam also tried to curb the authority of the Makramah (Isma'ili) sect, which had used the times of trouble to take over the al-Haymah district.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, San'a'; an Arabian Islamic City. London 1983, p. 91. Although being supported by the Arhab tribe, he was unsuccessful in this enterprise. As a consequence, his prestige dwindled, and San'a once again became the scene of plunderings by tribesmen.Yehuda Nini, 1991, p. 143. Ottoman takeover Lowland Yemen had been under Ottoman rule since 1849. After the Suez Canal was opened in 1869, the Porte feared increased British influence in the southern part of Arabia. With this in mind, the Ottoman authorities resolved to bring entire Yemen under their thumb, in 1872. In the meantime, al-Mutawakkil al- Muhsin had estranged a good part of the population of San'a. Governor Muhsin Mu'id therefore acknowledged a rival of al-Mutawakkil al-Muhsin, called al- Hadi Ghalib, as the right imam. The governor and al-Hadi Ghalib welcomed the Turkish troops who marched into San'a in April 1872. With this intervention the Zaidi state was effectively brought to an end, since a new administration was introduced. Al-Mutawakkil al-Muhsin withdrew to Haddah south of San'a where he rallied support to fight the Turkish occupiers. He was able to rouse the Hashid and Arhab tribes for his cause.Vincent Steven Wilhite, Guerilla war, counterinsurgency, and state formation in Ottoman Yemen. PhD Thesis, Ohio State University 2003, p. 213. His tribal followers were defeated in a series of battles in the same year, however. Al-Mutawakkil al-Muhsin refused to give up resistance and continued to create trouble for the Ottoman governance until his death in 1878.Caesar E. Farah, The Sultan's Yemen; Nineteenth-Century Challenges to Ottoman Rule. London 2002, pp. 85-104. The imam's alliance with the tribal groups remained firm henceforth. He was however unable to seriously threaten the position of the occupiers. After 1888 his sons agreed to receive a pension from the Turkish governor in exchange for loyalty. The torch of resistance was taken over by a pretender-imam of another family, al-Hadi Sharaf ad-Din.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, p. 92.

They are usually available in two different shapes (shot and grit) that address different industrial applications. Steel shot refers to spherical grains made of molten steel through an atomization (\\"granulation\\") process, available in different sizes and hardnesses. Steel grit characterizes grains with a predominantly angular shape. These grains are obtained by crushing steel shot, therefore they exhibit sharp edges and broken sections. Harder than steel shot, it is also available in different sizes and hardnesses. Properties Most steel abrasives are made of a high-carbon steel composition, the best compromise between mechanical properties, efficiency and durability. The most important properties for steel abrasives are hardness, grain size and shape, toughness and cleanliness (lack of oxides, contaminants, etc.). Recyclability and environmental impact The recyclability of steel shot and grit ranges between 2000 and 3000 cycles. Due to its high recyclability level, steel shot and grit tend to generate less waste when compared to other expendable abrasives. Hardness Steel shot or grit is usually available at different hardness levels, ranging between 40 and 65 on the Rockwell scale (400 to 850 on the Vickers hardness scale). Industrial applications Cleaning Steel shot and grit are used in cleaning applications for removal of loose material on metal surfaces. This type of cleaning is common in automotive industry (motor blocks, cylinder heads, etc.). Surface preparation Surface preparation is a series of operations including cleaning and physical modification of a surface. Steel shot and grit are used in surface preparation process for cleaning metal surfaces which are covered with mill scale, dirt, rust, or paint coatings and for physically modifying the metal surface such as creating roughness for better application of paint and coating. The steel shots are generally employed in shot blasting machines, first made by US-based company Wheelabrator in 1932. In China, shot blasting machines were built around the 1950s, Qinggong Machinery is one of the earliest manufacturers in that industry. Stone cutting Steel grit is used in cutting hard stones, such as granite. The grit is used in large multi-blade frames which cut the blocks of granite into thin slices.  Shot peening  Shot peening is the repeated striking of a metal surface by hard shot particles. These multiple impacts produce a deformation on the metal surface but also improve the durability of the metal part. The media used in this application is spherical rather than angular. The reason is that spherical shots are more resistant to the fracture which happens due to the striking impact. Industrial uses Steel shot and grit address numerous sectors since cleaning, surface preparation or shot peening applications are used by many industries as a part of their construction, renovation or repair processes. The main industrial sectors employing steel abrasives are: *Automotive industry *Construction *Metallurgy *Petrochemical industry Production The annual steel abrasive production in the world is estimated to be above 1 million tonnes, the world‚Äôs largest producer being Winoa Group (previously known as Wheelabrator Allevard) by production and capacity.

Plot summary The novel begins in the year 1900 with the McClure family, which consists of Emma, the mother, her father Granpap, and Emma's children: Basil, Kirk, Bonnie, and John. They make their living in the Appalachian Mountains as farmers and bootleggers. The family is forced to live through a harsh winter with little food. It is apparent they must work hard for what they need. They are also poor, as they must take credit at the general store to buy food. As the family continues to barely subsist, the ‚Äúoutside‚Äù seems to be creeping closer to the isolated families of the Appalachian region. One day a peddler from the outside comes to visits the McClures. He tells the family about a new mill in town where they are hiring many people. Granpap quickly dismisses him because he does not like the outsider. The family struggles to make a living and challenging personal relationships often get in the way. Kirk is revealed to be a drunk and very poor at managing money. Kirk becomes involved with Minnie, and she is revealed to be pregnant, although it is unclear who the father is. Granpap is arrested for bootlegging and is sentenced to two years in jail. Basil decides to leave the family to gain an education. Kirk is killed, and it appears that Sam McEachern is the one who shot him. Basil returns later asking for money for books at his school, and with the death of Kirk and Granpap in jail, money is very tight. Granpap decided that his family would move to Leesville to work in the mill to make more money. When the families arrive at Leesville, they believe that working in the mill will provide them with more opportunities. Frank, Ora, and Emma begin their jobs at the mill. In the fall, John and Bonnie start school. However, not long after that, Emma becomes ill and Bonnie and John are forced to begin working and leave school. John begins a friendship with John Stevens, a veteran mill worker and union supporter. As Bonnie and John grow up, Bonnie marries Jim Calhoun. Emma's condition continues to worsen, and she dies. Later, Jim has and accident that precludes him from working, and he abandons his family. Granpap becomes ill and soon dies. Working at the mill is hard on families. One day one of Bonnie's kids gets pneumonia while she is at work and dies. Mary Allen, an African American worker, is sympathetic and sends her daughter to care for Bonnie's children. John and Bonnie continue to work in the mill but they are unhappy with their situation. Workers wages are cut and the number of positions reduced. As John has learned many things about unions he decides to unionize the workers and starts a strike. The workers picket outside the factory and are often jailed and beaten. Bonnie is also involved in the unionization of workers. Because of her relationship with Mary Allen, Bonnie helps to make the union integrated so African Americans do not scab. John and the other union leaders decide to hold a rally. During the rally Bonnie is shot and killed. In the aftermath, John Stevens tells John ‚Äúthis is just the beginning.‚Äù Characters * Granpap: Civil War veteran and bootlegger. Goes to jail for two years for bootlegging. He is too old to be able to work in the mills. * Emma: Does not like Granpap selling moonshine, but wants her family to have money. Decides to move the family out of the mountains to work at the mills. * Kirk: Emma's son, is killed by Sam McEachern. Takes the side of Granpap for selling moonshine to make money. * Basil: Leaves the family to go school and does not have to work in the mills. Wants to distance himself from his mountainous family. * Sam: Part of the McEachern family, who are bootleggers. Ends up shooting Kirk and killing him. * Bonnie: Becomes the female breadwinner for her family. Experiences many torments experiencing while working in the mills and feels the weight of supporting the family. * John: Like Bonnie, he also becomes a major contributor for the family. Young and strong, John becomes the man of the family. Analysis Inspired by her own experience in Gastonia, North Carolina during the textile strike, Lumpkin's writing style in the radical literary tradition is explored in several political themes encompassing the exhausting pursuit of unionization. The McClure family represents the struggle between the familial and the communal as they move to the mill town to make a better life for themselves. In doing so, they shift from an agrarian lifestyle to urban where everyone in the family must pull their weight to barely make a living. The exploitation of mill workers challenges the formerly matriarchal, agrarian family structure of the McClures as they endure a starved winter, an arrest, and murder ‚Äì all the while, mothers and children are employed in long hours of harsh working conditions. Lumpkin's central theme conveyed through the quest for unionized life is the plight of working-class women during the Great Depression. Emma and Bonnie take on roles of motherhood and workers who struggled severely in dividing their duties. There is no joy in having children at this time, and reproductive obligations leave the mothers with no choice but to solely provide, as their productive capacities place them in a limited socioeconomic role. Lumpkin's progressive voice is explored most through Bonnie, who represents solidarity against mill management, while inspiring others through nobility and perseverance. When Bonnie joins the strike, she exposes the importance of the woman's role and takes a radical step towards her goal of unifying the working class, regardless of ethnic background or race, as demonstrated by her organization of African American workers. Bonnie's efforts cemented her legacy after her tragic death. Her attempts to blend class separation and expose the working woman emulates Lumpkin's political themes, portrayed throughout the defeating journey of the McClure's search for security.

It is found in shallow, nutrient-poor, usually acid standing or running water, bogs, fens and occasionally ditches. Description Bog pondweed is a perennial, growing from creeping rhizomes. The stems are up to 0.7 m long, terete and unbranched. The submerged leaves are long (60‚Äì160 mm) and fairly narrow (2.5‚Äì24 mm), delicate and translucent with long (14‚Äì80 mm)petioles, tending to decay rather early in the season, typically once the floating leaves appear. The floating leaves are opaque, 40-105 x 15‚Äì70 mm, usually brownish or dark green in colour with a pink tint when young, with inconspicuous secondary veins. There are no turions. The inflorescences are up to 42 mm long and produce numerous small greenish flowers. The fruits are 1.9-2.6 mm x 1.4-1.9 mm, larger than P. coloratus but smaller than P. natans. Bog pondweed occurs both as terrestrial plants in seeps and wet moss, and as aquatic forms, and is very variable. Terrestrial forms in particular can be very difficult to identify. It is most likely to be confused with P. natans which it resembles in general habit, but can usually be distinguished by the presence of submerged leaves (these are reduced to strap-like phyllodes in P.natans) and the absence of a discoloured mark at the base of the floating leaves. The submerged leaves of P. alpinus can be similar, but these are sessile. Although a common plant, bog pondweed does not seem to hybridise readily with other pondweeds, though hybrids with P. natans (P. √ó gessnacensis G.Fisch.), P. gramineus, P. alpinus (P. √ó spathulatus Schrad. ex W.D.J.Koch & Ziz), P. berchtoldii (P. √ó rivularis Gillot)and P. pusillus have been recorded. Distribution Potamogeton polygonifolius is mainly restricted to western Europe (Britain, Ireland, France, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark). It is more localised in the rest of its range including Northern Iberia, Germany, mainland Italy, Sicily, southern Scandinavia, the Baltic states, the Balkans and eastern Europe.Naturhistorika riksmuseet (Sweden) B√§cknate Potamogeton polygonifolius Pourr., northern hemisphere range map There are outlying populations in North Africa (Morocco, Algeria), Orkney, Shetland, the Faroes and Newfoundland, and fossils have been found in Russia. The taxonomic status of populations in the Himalayas requires confirmation. A record from China was based on a misidentification of P. distinctus. Bog pondweed, Potamogeton polygonifolius, in a lake outflow in North Wales. Ecology and conservation In Britain and Ireland, this is one of the commonest pondweeds, occurring in almost any wet or semi-wet oligotrophic and / or acidic habitat so long as flow is not too rapid. It may be found in lakes, slow-flowing rivers, ponds, ditches, seeps and among bog mosses (Sphagnum). As its name suggests, it is common in areas of blanket bog but may also occur in secondary habitats such as unshaded drainage ditches in bogs and forest plantations. In British rivers it typically grows with other soft-water species such as Ranunculus flammula, Carex nigra, C. rostrata, Scapania undulata and Equisetum fluviatile. In lakes it tends to occur in base-poor, oligotrophic waters with species such as Littorella uniflora, Sphagnum spp., Lobelia dortmanna and Isoetes lacustris especially with a peaty substrate. Potamogeton polygonifolius is tolerant of acid conditions and therefore has not been affected by the widespread acidification of upland habitats in Britain. However, in very acidified pools in Holland (pH < 5), catchment liming increased the abundance of this and other threatened species. Although it shows a strong preference for soft waters, bog pondweed may also occur in calcareous but low-nutrient habitats. In lowland areas it is more scattered and has declined in southern and eastern England due to nutrient enrichment. In Central Europe, Potamogeton polygonifolius is threatened, and is considered endangered in Germany, Poland, Switzerland, the Czech Republic. and Luxemburg. However, remaining populations in this area are still strong and reproduce freely. Bog pondweed is also a Red List species in Holland. left Cultivation Bog pondweed is not in general cultivation, although it is easy to grow. Its preference for shallow water makes it very suitable for a garden pond, but it would probably be difficult to establish in high nutrient, hard water areas.

It transforms a function (which can be given via closed formulas or neural networks, fuzzy logic, etc.) into TP function form if such a transformation is possible. If an exact transformation is not possible, then the method determines a TP function that is an approximation of the given function. Hence, the TP model transformation can provide a trade-off between approximation accuracy and complexity. A free MATLAB implementation of the TP model transformation can be downloaded at or an old version of the toolbox is aviable at MATLAB Central . A key underpinning of the transformation is the higher-order singular value decomposition. Besides being a transformation of functions, the TP model transformation is also a new concept in qLPV based control which plays a central role in the providing a valuable means of bridging between identification and polytopic systems theories. The TP model transformation is uniquely effective in manipulating the convex hull of polytopic forms, and, as a result has revealed and proved the fact that convex hull manipulation is a necessary and crucial step in achieving optimal solutions and decreasing conservativenessA.Szollosi, and Baranyi, P.

Thus, although it is a transformation in a mathematical sense, it has established a conceptually new direction in control theory and has laid the ground for further new approaches towards optimality. Further details on the control theoretical aspects of the TP model transformation can be found here: TP model transformation in control theory. The TP model transformation motivated the definition of the \\"HOSVD canonical form of TP functions\\", on which further information can be found here. It has been proved that the TP model transformation is capable of numerically reconstructing this HOSVD based canonical form. Thus, the TP model transformation can be viewed as a numerical method to compute the HOSVD of functions, which provides exact results if the given function has a TP function structure and approximative results otherwise. The TP model transformation has recently been extended in order to derive various types of convex TP functions and to manipulate them. This feature has led to new optimization approaches in qLPV system analysis and design, as described here: TP model transformation in control theory. Definitions ;Finite element TP function: A given function f({\\\\mathbf{x}}), where \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in R^N, is a TP function if it has the structure: :: f(\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\sum_{i_1=1}^{I_1} \\\\sum_{i_2=1}^{I_2} \\\\ldots \\\\sum_{i_N=1}^{I_N} \\\\prod_{n=1}^N w_{n,i_n}(x_n) s_{i_1,i_2,\\\\ldots,i_N}, that is, using compact tensor notation (using the tensor product operation \\\\otimes of ): :: f(\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\mathcal{S}\\\\mathop{\\\\otimes}_{n=1}^N\\\\mathbf{w}_n(x_n), where core tensor \\\\mathcal{S}\\\\in \\\\mathcal{R}^{I_1\\\\times I_2\\\\times \\\\ldots \\\\times I_N} is constructed from s_{i_1 i_2 \\\\ldots i_N}, and row vector \\\\mathbf{w}_n(x_n), (n=1 \\\\ldots N) contains continuous univariate weighting functions w_{n,i_n}(x_n),(i_n=1 \\\\ldots I_n). The function w_{n,i_n}(x_n) is the i_n-th weighting function defined on the n-th dimension, and x_n is the n-the element of vector \\\\mathbf{x}. Finite element means that I_n is bounded for all n . For qLPV modelling and control applications a higher structure of TP functions are referred to as TP model. ;Finite element TP model (TP model in short): This is a higher structure of TP function: :: \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\mathcal{S}\\\\boxtimes_{n=1}^N\\\\mathbf{w}_n(x_n). Here \\\\mathcal{Y}=\\\\mathcal{F}({\\\\mathbf{x}}) is a tensor as \\\\mathcal{Y}\\\\in \\\\mathcal{R}^{L_1\\\\times L_2\\\\times \\\\ldots L_O}, thus the size of the core tensor is \\\\mathcal{S}\\\\in \\\\mathcal{R}^{I_1\\\\times I_2\\\\times \\\\ldots \\\\times I_N \\\\times L_1\\\\times L_2\\\\times ... \\\\times L_O}. The product operator \\\\boxtimes has the same role as \\\\otimes , but expresses the fact that the tensor product is applied on the L_1\\\\times L_2\\\\times ... \\\\times L_O sized tensor elements of the core tensor \\\\mathcal{S}. Vector \\\\mathbf{x} is an element of the closed hypercube \\\\Omega=[a_1,b_1]\\\\times[a_2,b_2]\\\\times ... \\\\times[a_N,b_N]\\\\subset R^N. ;Finite element convex TP function or model: A TP function or model is convex if the wighting functions hold: :: \\\\forall n : \\\\sum_{i_n=1}^{I_n} w_{n,i_n}(x_n) = 1 and w_{n,i_n}(x_n) \\\\in [0,1] . This means that f(\\\\mathbf{x}) is inside the convex hull defined by the core tensor for all \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\Omega . ;TP model transformation: Assume a given TP model \\\\mathcal{Y} = \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\mathbf{x}) , where \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in \\\\Omega \\\\subset R^N, whose TP structure maybe unknown (e.g. it is given by neural networks). The TP model transformation determines its TP structure as :: \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\mathbf{x})=\\\\mathcal{S}\\\\boxtimes_{n=1}^N\\\\mathbf{w}_n(x_n) , namely it generates the core tensor \\\\mathcal{S} and the weighting functions \\\\mathbf{w}_n(x_n) for all n=1 \\\\ldots N . Its free MATLAB implementation is downloadable at or at MATLAB Central . If the given \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\mathbf{x}) does not have TP structure (i.e. it is not in the class of TP models), then the TP model transformation determines its approximation: :: \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\approx \\\\mathcal{S}\\\\boxtimes_{n=1}^N\\\\mathbf{w}_n(x_n), where trade-off is offered by the TP model transformation between complexity (number of components in the core tensor or the number of weighting functions) and the approximation accuracy. The TP model can be generated according to various constrains. Typical TP models generated by the TP model transformation are: * HOSVD canonical form of TP functions or TP model (qLPV models), * Various kinds of TP type polytopic form or convex TP model forms (this advantage is used in qLPV system analysis and design). Properties of the TP model transformation * It is a non-heuristic and tractable numerical method firstly proposed in control theory. * It transforms the given function into finite element TP structure. If this structure does not exist, then the transformation gives an approximation under a constraint on the number of elements. * It can be executed uniformly (irrespective of whether the model is given in the form of analytical equations resulting from physical considerations, or as an outcome of soft computing based identification techniques (such as neural networks or fuzzy logic based methods, or as a result of a black-box identification), without analytical interaction, within a reasonable amount of time. Thus, the transformation replaces the analytical and in many cases complex and not obvious conversions to numerical, tractable, straightforward operations. * It generates the HOSVD-based canonical form of TP functions, which is a unique representation. It was proven by Szeidl that the TP model transformation numerically reconstructs the HOSVD of functions. This form extracts the unique structure of a given TP function in the same sense as the HOSVD does for tensors and matrices, in a way such that: :* the number of weighting functions are minimized per dimensions (hence the size of the core tensor); :* the weighting functions are one variable functions of the parameter vector in an orthonormed system for each parameter (singular functions); :* the sub tensors of the core tensor are also in orthogonal positions; :* the core tensor and the weighting functions are ordered according to the higher-order singular values of the parameter vector; :* it has a unique form (except for some special cases such as there are equal singular values); :* introduces and defines the rank of the TP function by the dimensions of the parameter vector; * The above point can be extended to TP models (qLPV models to determine the HOSVD based canonical form of qLPV model to order the main component of the qLPV model). Since the core tensor is N+O dimensional, but the weighting functions are determined only for dimensions n=1 \\\\ldots N , namely the core tensor is constructed from O dimensional elements, therefore the resulting TP form is not unique. *The core step of the TP model transformation was extended to generate different types of convex TP functions or TP models (TP type polytopic qLPV models), in order to focus on the systematic (numerical and automatic) modification of the convex hull instead of developing new LMI equations for feasible controller design (this is the widely adopted approach). It is worth noting that both the TP model transformation and the LMI-based control design methods are numerically executable one after the other, and this makes the resolution of a wide class of problems possible in a straightforward and tractable, numerical way. * The TP model transformation is capable of performing trade-off between complexity and accuracy of TP functions via discarding the higher-order singular values, in the same manner as the tensor HOSVD is used for complexity reduction.

As a conservative Republican, she is best known as the Republican director of the Open Government Institute, a bi- partisan, non-profit election transparency organization. She frequently appears on national cable television shows, and has been featured in a Newsweek cover story and a Washington Post column as a leading voice transforming the partisan nature of America's drug policy debate. Specifically, she has articulated her support of the decriminalization of marijuana. High Times magazine featured Peck as a 2009 \\"freedom fighter of the month\\". In 2008, Peck served as executive director of the \\"Yes on 46\\" campaign, which unsuccessfully sought passage of Colorado ballot initiative Amendment 46, a campaign determined to end race and gender affirmative action programs in state government and public contracting. Today, she serves as an appointee to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission's Colorado Advisory Committee, through which she chairs the sub-committee on educational due process. As the youngest of four children raised by a single father and as part of a broader multi-ethnicity family, Peck vocally rejected what she refers to as \\"the soft bigotry of low expectations\\" for demographic groups presumed as inferior and in need of government aid simply because of biology. Similarly, in 2004 she opposed restrictions imposed on an education class at the University of Colorado seeking enrollment of minorities and first-generation college students, which resulted in the University rescinding the restrictions. The Amendment 46 contest was the most narrow election outcome in that year's Colorado general election, garnering 49 percent of the vote. In 2004, and at the minimum permissible age of 25, Peck ran for the District 19 seat in the Colorado State Senate but was defeated by incumbent Sue Windels. Peck's defeats here have been followed by many legislative and litigation victories related to property rights, medical marijuana, free speech, and parental rights. She is known as a free thinking libertarian who has frequently taken on the GOP over its more conservative positions relating to gay rights and sentencing reform. She is the mother to two young daughters and lives in Denver's Hilltop neighborhood. Peck was formerly married to Denver lawyer Rob Corry. After the fallout following an incident where Corry was accused of and eventually convicted of third degree sexual assault on a family friend, the two divorced.http://www.westword.com/news/rob-corry-marijuana-advocate- arrested-after-allegedly-breaking-rv-window-5851674 She represents clients across the nation, most frequently in Washington, D.C. A former U.S. Senate press secretary, she has also worked as a print and broadcast journalist, a broadcast producer, and as a sideline freelancer for ESPN's Monday Night Football. Peck has a bachelor's degree in journalism from University of Colorado-Boulder (2001), a master's degree in government from Johns Hopkins University (2003), and a J.D. degree from the University of Denver. In addition, she has held several prestigious fellowships, including the Pulliam Fellowship, the Washington Center For Politics and Journalism Fellowship, and the Phillips Foundation's Robert Novak Journalism Fellowship. She has studied at multiple international educational institutions, including Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., Prague's Charles University and the University of the Dutch Antilles in Cura√ßao.

The nickname \\"Blue Rocks\\" came from 73-year-old Robert Miller in a name-the-team contest. Miller lived in the Henry Clay section of the city, famed for its blue granite found along the Brandywine River. The current Wilmington Blue Rocks were named in 1992 for this original franchise. In 1940, Bob Carpenter founded the original Wilmington Blue Rocks in partnership with Connie Mack as a Class B Interstate League affiliate of Mack's Philadelphia A's. In 1943, the Carpenter family bought the Philadelphia Phillies, and before the 1944 season they bought out Mack's interest and made the Blue Rocks an affiliate of the Phillies. The Phillies purchased the club outright in March 1945. The Blue Rocks played multiple mid-season exhibition games in Wilmington against major league clubs. The Blue Rocks went 2‚Äì2 against the Phillies, winning, 5‚Äì1, on August 23, 1943, and 9‚Äì3 on June 5, 1944, and losing, 7‚Äì4, on July 8, 1947, and 5‚Äì3 on July 11, 1951.http://retrosheet.org/Research/LeConteW/InSeasonExhibitionGames.htm The Blue Rocks played in Wilmington Park at 30th Street and Governor Printz Boulevard. Some 7,000 fans attended the Blue Rocks' first game at the ballpark in 1940 and the club established a Class B attendance record in 1940 with 145,643 attending ballgames at Wilmington Park. The club topped that mark with 172,531 fans in 1944. The single game attendance record for the Blue Rocks was set in 1947 when 7,062 fans saw Curt Simmons' Wilmington debut. By 1950 attendance for the season had dropped to 38,678. Although 1951 saw a slight improvement to 43,135, attendance declined again in 1952, which proved to be the last season both for the Interstate League and this incarnation of the Blue Rocks.

It lies south of the village of Sieber in the unincorporated area of Harz in the district of G√∂ttingen in the state of Lower Saxony.  Name  The Aschentalshalbe was named after the Aschental (\\"Aschen valley\\"), a southern branch of the Tiefenbeekstal (\\"Tiefenbeek valley\\"), through which the Tiefenbeek flows.  Geography   Location  The Aschentalshalbe lies in the Upper Harz within the Harz Nature Park about 2 km southeast of Sieber, a village northeast of Herzberg am Harz. It rises between the Gropenbornskopf to the north, the Koboltstaler K√∂pfe to the northeast with their outlier, the G√∂deckenkopf, to the east, the Schadenbeeksk√∂pfe to the southeast, the √úbelsberg to the south, the Gro√üer Knollen to the south-southwest, the Pagelsburg to the southwest, the Adlersberg to the west and the Breitentalskopf to the northwest.  Watershed  The watershed between the Sieber to the north and west and the Oder to the east and south runs over the Aschentalshalbe. Whilst the Tiefenbeek that rises north of the mountain flows northwest into the Sieber, the Grade Lutter that rises on its southern uplands is the right headstream of the Lutter that flows southwards into the Oder.  Summits and survey points  The Aschentalshalbe has several summits: * The western summit (Westkuppe), also called Hohes Feld is 667 m metres high. There is a view of the Sieber from the top. * The two main summits, which are roughly in the centre of the ridge, are the highest points at about 685 m above sea level * The east-northeast summit is about 640 m metres high. Just to the southeast is a trig point on the map (627.0 m). From there and the refuge hut, a little to the east, the view drops away to the south.  Walking  Harz Club trail no. 15 G runs over the Aschentalshalbe from which several footpaths lead to the neighbouring summits. There is a refuge hut with the Schadenbeeksk√∂pfe checkpoint of the Harzer Wandernadel hiking network near the eastern summit of the Aschentalshalbe. The hut is around 1.25 km east- northeast of the mountain and about 1 km north of the northwestern summit of the nearby Schadenbeeksk√∂pfe.

Introduction A model of a gas of particles moving in one dimension and satisfying Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics was introduced in 1963 Elliott H. Lieb and Werner Liniger, Exact Analysis of an Interacting Bose Gas. I. The General Solution and the Ground State, Physical Review 130: 1605‚Äì1616, 1963Elliott H. Lieb, Exact Analysis of an Interacting Bose Gas. II. The Excitation Spectrum, Physical Review 130:1616‚Äì1624,1963 in order to study whether the available approximate theories of such gases, specifically Bogoliubov's theory, would conform to the actual properties of the model gas. The model is based on a well defined Schr√∂dinger Hamiltonian for particles interacting with each other via a two-body potential, and all the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian can, in principle, be calculated exactly. Sometimes it is called one dimensional Bose gas with delta interaction. It also can be considered as quantum non-linear Schr√∂dinger equation. The ground state as well as the low-lying excited states were computed and found to be in agreement with Bogoliubov's theory when the potential is small, except for the fact that there are actually two types of elementary excitations instead of one, as predicted by Bogoliubov's and other theories. The model seemed to be only of academic interest until, with the sophisticated experimental techniques developed in the first decade of the 21st century, it became possible to produce this kind of gas using real atoms as particles. Definition and solution of the model There are N particles with coordinates x on the line [0,L], with periodic boundary conditions. Thus, an allowed wave function \\\\psi(x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_j, \\\\dots,x_N) is symmetric, i.e., \\\\psi(\\\\dots, x_i,\\\\dots, x_j, \\\\dots) = \\\\psi(\\\\dots, x_j,\\\\dots, x_i, \\\\dots) for all i eq j and \\\\psi satisfies \\\\psi( \\\\dots, x_j=0, \\\\dots ) =\\\\psi(\\\\dots, x_j=L,\\\\dots ) for all j. The Hamiltonian, in appropriate units, is : H = -\\\\sum olimits_{j=1}^N \\\\partial^2/\\\\partial x_j^2 +2c \\\\sum olimits_{1\\\\leq i< j\\\\leq N} \\\\delta(x_i-x_j)\\\\ , where \\\\delta is the Dirac delta function, i.e., the interaction is a contact interaction. The constant c\\\\geq 0 denotes its strength. The delta function gives rise to a boundary condition when two coordinates, say x_1 and x_2 are equal; this condition is that as x_2 \\\\searrow x_1, the derivative satisfies (\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_2} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_1} ) \\\\psi (x_1, x_2)_{x_2=x_1+}= c \\\\psi (x_1=x_2). The hard core limit c=\\\\infty is known as the Tonks‚ÄìGirardeau gas. Schr√∂dinger's time independent equation, H\\\\psi = E\\\\psi is solved by explicit construction of \\\\psi. Since \\\\psi is symmetric it is completely determined by its values in the simplex \\\\mathcal{R} , defined by the condition that 0\\\\leq x_1\\\\leq x_2 \\\\leq \\\\dots, \\\\leq x_N \\\\leq L. In this region one looks for a \\\\psi of the form considered by H.A. Bethe in 1931 in the context of magnetic spin systems‚Äîthe Bethe ansatz. That is, for certain real numbers k_1< k_2 < \\\\cdots , to be determined, : \\\\psi(x_1, \\\\dots, x_N) = \\\\sum_P a(P)\\\\exp \\\\left( i \\\\sum_{j=1}^N k_{P j} x_j\\\\right) where the sum is over all N ! permutations, P, of the integers 1,2, \\\\dots, N, and P maps 1,2,\\\\dots,N to P1,P2,\\\\dots,PN. The coefficients a(P), as well as the k's are determined by the condition H\\\\psi =E\\\\psi, and this leads to : E= \\\\sum olimits_{j=1}^N\\\\, k_j^2 : a(P) = \\\\prod olimits_{1\\\\leq i Dorlas (1993) proved that all eigenfunctions of H are of this form. These equations determine \\\\psi in terms of the k's, which, in turn, are determined by the periodic boundary conditions. These lead to N equations: : L\\\\, k_j= 2\\\\pi I_j\\\\ -2 \\\\sum olimits_{i=1}^N \\\\arctan \\\\left(\\\\frac{k_j-k_i}{c} \\\\right) \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\text{for } j=1, \\\\, \\\\dots,\\\\, N \\\\ , where I_1 < I_2<\\\\cdots < I_N are integers when N is odd and, when N is even, they take values \\\\pm \\\\frac12, \\\\pm \\\\frac32, \\\\dots . For the ground state the I's satisfy : I_{j+1} -I_j = 1, \\\\quad {\\\\rm for} \\\\ 1\\\\leq j The first kind of elementary excitation consists in choosing I_1,\\\\dots, I_{N-1} as before, but increasing I_N by an amount n>0 (or decreasing I_1 by n). The momentum of this state is p= 2\\\\pi n /L (or -2\\\\pi n /L). For the second kind, choose some 0< n \\\\leq N/2 and increase I_i\\\\to I_i+1 for all i\\\\geq n. The momentum of this state is p= \\\\pi - 2\\\\pi n/L. Similarly, there is a state with p= -\\\\pi +2\\\\pi n/L. The momentum of this type of excitation is limited to p \\\\leq \\\\pi. These excitations can be combined and repeated many times. Thus, they are bosonic-like. If we denote the ground state (= lowest) energy by E_0 and the energies of the states mentioned above by E_{1,2}(p) then \\\\epsilon_{1}(p) = E_{1}(p)-E_0 and \\\\epsilon_{2}(p) = E_{2}(p)-E_0 are the excitation energies of the two modes. Thermodynamic limit Fig. 1: The ground state energy, from. See text. To discuss a gas we take a limit N and L to infinity with the density \\\\rho =N/L fixed. The ground state energy per particle e = \\\\frac{E_0}{N\\\\rho^2}, and the \\\\epsilon_{1,2}(p) all have limits as N\\\\to \\\\infty. While there are two parameters, \\\\rho and c, simple length scaling x\\\\to \\\\rho x shows that there is really only one, namely \\\\gamma =c/\\\\rho. To evaluate E_0 we assume that the N k's lie between numbers K and -K, to be determined, and with a density L\\\\, f(k). This f is found to satisfy the equation (in the interval -K \\\\leq k \\\\leq K) : 2c\\\\int olimits_{-K}^K \\\\frac{f(p)}{c^2 +(p-k)^2} dp = 2\\\\pi f(k) -1 \\\\quad {\\\\rm and} \\\\quad \\\\int olimits_{-K}^K f(p) dp = \\\\rho \\\\ , which has a unique positive solution. An excitation distorts this density f and similar integral equations determine these distortions. The ground state energy per particle is given by : e = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho^3}\\\\int olimits_{-K}^K k^2 f(k) dk .

This one-dimensional gas can be made using real, three-dimensional atoms as particles. One can prove, mathematically, from the Schr√∂dinger equation for three-dimensional particles in a long cylindrical container, that the low energy states are described by the one- dimensional Lieb‚ÄìLiniger model. This was done for the ground state and for excited states. The cylinder does not have to be as narrow as the atomic diameter; it can be much wider if the excitation energy in the direction perpendicular to the axis is large compared to the energy per particle e.

The district was part of the Department of the Pacific, the commander of the department also being District commander. The district was created as a separate command on July 1, 1864, after Irvin McDowell took command of the Department of the Pacific, relieving General Wright, who then remained as District of California commander. The District comprised the state of California and the areas of the Rogue River and Umpqua River in Southern Oregon. Its headquarters were in San Francisco, co-located with those of the Department of the Pacific.

Early in the year, Marshal √âdouard Adolphe Casimir Joseph Mortier blockaded the city for two months before he was called elsewhere. In his absence, the Swedes drove back the inferior blockading force. After Mortier returned and pushed Essen's troops back in turn, the two sides quickly concluded an armistice. The truce was later repudiated by King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden, whereupon Marshal Guillaume Marie Anne Brune led 40,000 French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Dutch soldiers against the fortress. Fearfully outnumbered, the Swedes abandoned the Baltic Sea port of Stralsund to the Franco-Allies in this action during the War of the Fourth Coalition, part of the Napoleonic Wars. As a consequence, Sweden also lost the nearby island of R√ºgen. Prelude Sweden was established in Stralsund since the Battle of Stralsund (1628),Langer (2003), p.402 and in the rest of the Duchy of Pomerania since the Treaty of Stettin (1630).Sturdy (2002), p.59 By the Peace of Westphalia (1648) and the Treaty of Stettin (1653), the duchy was partitioned into a Swedish part, including Stralsund, and a Brandenburg-Prussian part.Shennan (1995), p.19 After minor losses in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679),Heitz (1995), p.241 Swedish Pomerania was reduced to the area north of the Peene river with Greifswald, Stralsund and R√ºgen in the Treaty of Stockholm in 1720.Heitz (1995), p.244 When Napoleon Bonaparte started to expand eastwards in the Napoleonic Wars, the Swedish Empire initially maintained a neutral stance. In 1805, Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden entered the War of the Third Coalition on the anti-French side, primarily to strip Napoleon's ally Denmark of Norway. His Norwegian ambitions were thwarted by several military and diplomatic setbacks.Barton (2008), p.118 The blockade Stralsund, a port in Swedish Pomerania, was defended by the Swedish governor Hans von Essen.Jacques (2006), p.973 On 28 January, French forces commanded by Marshal Mortier crossed the Peene River in an attempt to impose a blockade on Stralsund. To the east, General of Division Charles Louis Dieudonn√© Grandjean's division crossed the Peene at Anklam, driving back the Swedish outposts. To the west, General of Division Pierre Louis Dupas' division crossed the stream unopposed near Demmin. On the 29th, Mortier's two divisions appeared before the port and on 30 January began the blockade.Petre, p.264 For the next two months, the two sides fought a number of skirmishes as the French strengthened their lines of investment. Without control of the island of R√ºgen, the French were unable to interrupt Stralsund's sea communications and were harassed by Swedish gunboats. During the blockade, one French cavalry and three infantry regiments were taken from Mortier to fight against the Russians in Poland and replaced by troops from the Kingdom of Holland. On 29 March, Mortier received orders to leave Grandjean's division to maintain the blockade and march to assist in the Siege of Kolberg in Brandenburg-Prussian Pomerania. After Mortier left, Essen drove Grandjean's outnumbered troops from their lines. Grandjean fell back to Anklam where he was attacked again on 3 April and forced to retreat southeast to the fortress of Stettin on the Oder, arriving there on the 7th. Mortier retraced his steps and by 13 April had assembled 12,000 to 13,000 men at Stettin, about the same number as Essen. In very wet weather, Mortier began pressing Essen back to Anklam.Petre, p.265 On 16 April, Mortier defeated the Swedes in the Battle of Belling.Manso (1835), p.293 The next day, Essen retreated to the north bank of the Peene. Beginning on 18 April, the French and Swedish forces arranged the truce of Schlatkow.von Daniels (1863), p.214 Anxious to employ Mortier's men against the Russians and Prussians, Napoleon had authorized the marshal to make a truce with the Swedes. For their part, the Swedes were upset that England had given them very little support. By the 29th, the terms were worked out. The Swedes were to stay on the north side of the Peene. They handed over the islands of Usedom and Wolin at the mouth of the Oder and promised not to help the Prussians at the sieges of Kolberg (Kolobrzeg) or Danzig.Petre, pp.265-266 The siege Guillaume Brune King Gustav IV Adolf landed in Stralsund on 12 May, and denounced the truce on 3 July. By this time, the Treaties of Tilsit had just deprived Sweden of all her allies but Great Britain. Autocrat Gustav IV Adolf however viewed Napoleon as the \\"monster of the apocalypse\\" and was unwilling to compromise on his anti- French policies.Porter (1988), p.174 On 24 July, French Marshal Guillaume Brune attacked the Swedish positions on the Peene river and reoccupied the investing lines around Stralsund. Reinforced by troops from the failed Siege of Kolberg, Brune massed a total of 40,000 men. His French troops included General of Division Jean Boudet's 7-battalion French infantry division of 7,773 infantry and 200 artillerymen and General of Division Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor's 8-battalion French infantry division of 8,712 infantry and 205 gunners. The Dutch contingent had General of Division Jean-Baptiste Dumonceau's 11-battalion infantry division of 9,924 foot soldiers and 570 gunners, General of Division Henri Gatien Bertrand's 6-battalion infantry division of 3,932 infantry and 159 artillerymen, and General of Division Carteret's 5-squadron cavalry brigade of 1,112 troopers.Smith, p.253 Hans Henric von Essen Brune's Spanish allies included General Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana's 14 infantry battalions and 12 cavalry squadrons. This corps totalled 9,763 infantry, 2,340 cavalry, 324 gunners, and 104 sappers. General of Division Domenico Pino led a Kingdom of Italy division consisting of eight battalions, eight squadrons, two foot artillery batteries, and one horse artillery battery. The Grand Duchy of Baden contributed six battalions, one squadron, and one foot artillery battery. The small German states were represented by the Grand Duchy of W√ºrzburg, two battalions, Duchy of Berg, two battalions, and Duchy of Nassau, three battalions. The 15,000 Swedish defenders included three Finnish battalions, Pommeranian Landwehr garrison troops, one battalion of the King's Leib Infantry Regiment and one battalion of the Engelbrechten Infantry Regiment. There were 500 cannons in the fortress. Subordinate to Essen were Lieutenant General Armfelt, General-Major Vegesack, and General-Major Peyron. Gustav IV Adolf left the town on 20 August. Deciding that resistance was useless, the Swedes spiked the cannon and burned the gun carriages. They evacuated the port and transported the power and shot to R√ºgen. During the second siege, the Franco-Allies lost 38 officers and 960 soldiers killed, wounded, missing, or died of illness. Swedish losses are unknown. Stralsund and R√ºgen were surrendered to France in the course of an armistice. Stralsund was handed over to the French on 24 August and R√ºgen on 7 September 1807. On 25 August, General of Brigade Fran√ßois Nicolas Fririon and naval Captain Peytes de Montcabri√© attacked the fortified island of D√§nholm near R√ºgen. The 1,200-man and two-gun force comprised one battalion of the 30th Line Infantry Regiment, artillery, sappers, pontonniers, miners, and sailors of the Imperial Guard. The successful operation cost the French 15 killed and 26 wounded.Smith, pp 253-254 The 600Bj√∂rlin (1882), p.221 to 800Smith, pp 253-254 Swedish defenders lost between 26von Vegesack (1840), p.91 and 125Smith, pp 253-254 men in dead and wounded, while between 300 and 517 were captured. Eight fortress guns and six field pieces also fell into French hands.Smith, pp 253-254 Aftermath After Sweden was driven out of northern Germany in 1807, she became subject to attacks from Denmark-Norway and the Russian Empire in 1808. Military mismanagement and lack of support led to Gustav IV Adolf being arrested on 13 March 1809 in the course of an insurrection. He was deposed in May and he and his family were expelled in December after Sweden lost a third of its realm in the Treaty of Fredrikshamn. French occupation of Stralsund was temporarily interrupted when a Prussian freikorps under Ferdinand von Schill seized the city in May 1809, but after a few days it was recaptured in the Battle of Stralsund. When the Napoleonic Wars were concluded by the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Stralsund along with all of Swedish Pomerania became part of the Prussian Pomerania Province.

Fresco, attributed to Moretti, from the apse of S. Calimero, Milan. Cristoforo Moretti (documented in Lombardy and Piedmont 1451 ‚Äì 1475) was a Lombard painter of the quattrocento who worked in a late International Gothic style very similar to that of Michelino da Besozzo‚Äôs last period. Few of the unsigned works later attributed to him are attributed with perfect certainty. Biography Born in Soncino in the Province of Cremona,Pittori Lombardi del quattrocento, by Francesco Malaguzzi Valeri, page 83. he is first recorded in 1451, working for the Borromeos in Milan. Between then and 1475 he is found variously in Milan, in Genoa, in Turin, in Casale, where he decorated the chapel of the Paleologi castle, and in Vercelli. (It seems that he was expelled from Milan in 1462, accused of having defamed the wife of Bianca Maria Visconti‚Äôs doctor.) He is documented as part of team of artists, including Vincenzo Foppa and Giovanni Battista Montorfano forming an estimate for the paintings of Stefano dei Fedeli in a chapel of the Castle of Milan.Francesco Malaguzzi Valeri, page 84. His best-known work, and the only one surviving to bear his signature, is probably the polyptych painted for the chapel of Sant‚ÄôAquilino next to the Milanese church of S. Lorenzo Maggiore. The work was subsequently broken up and dispersed, but most of its constituent parts were identified by Roberto Longhi in 1928. Three panels, depicting the Virgin and Child enthroned flanked by Saints Lawrence and Genesius of Rome (the latter playing a rebec), are today in the Museo Poldi Pezzoli in Milan. The whereabouts of the panel portraying Saint Peter the Martyr are unknown; however a fragment of that with Saint Lucy is in the Longhi Foundation in Florence and part of the predella, again showing Genesius, is conserved in Bologna.

Most commonly known for their song \\"Pittsburgh Makes Me Drunk\\". Their influences include Pat McCurdy, The Kingston Trio, Great Big Sea, Cake, The Pogues, Johnny Cash, Flogging Molly, Ween, They Might Be Giants, The Town Pants, Barenaked Ladies and Willie Nelson. History Patrick Halloran and Marc Wisnosky started the band in college. They wanted to play some Irish songs at a party on St. Patrick's Day, so they learned a few of the classic Irish pub tunes and wrote a couple of original Pittsburgh-themed Irish songs. They started off by playing at an open mic event. They began to play about fifteen to twenty Irish songs and then would eventually switch to songs by 'N Sync, Hanson, Snoop Dogg, NWA. Ceann formed as an Irish rock band in Pittsburgh in 2005 with the release of their first album of all-original material Almost Irish. Before that, Ceann was an acoustic trio consisting of Halloran, Wisnosky, and James G. Telfer IV, that played Irish pub music across the northeast. Ceann continued to mix fun Irish music with their popular originals. While some of Ceann's songs revolve around the culture of being Irish Americans, many of Ceann's most popular songs have distinctively more contemporary themes. Their songs appeal far beyond the normal reach of Irish music and have given them access to unprecedented markets for an Irish band. As one of the only Irish bands to find success on commercial radio, Ceann's fan base has grown as quickly outside of Irish music circles as quickly as it's grown within them. Their cross market appeal allowed them to be featured at Irish festivals and at non-Irish music festivals to equal success. On February 1, 2011 lead singer Patrick Halloran was killed in a car accident in Vermont. The remaining members of Ceann, along with past members, played together at Halloran's memorial service. In the summer of 2013, various Ceann members got together in Pittsburgh, PA, New York, NY, and Virginia Beach, VA to play shows in support of the tribute album The Legend of Handsome Pat, a compilation of songs written by Halloran and recorded by various artists. Produced by Halloran's brother, Brian Halloran, the album features contributions by Brian Halloran, Ceann, Paul Tabachneck, The Hang Lows, Icewagon Flu, Scythian, The Havers, Peanut Butter & Julie, The Fighting Jamesons, Cruel Seamus, and Patrick Halloran. Name Ceann is pronounced \\"Key-ANN\\". It means head. The original name was Ceann na Caca, which is Gaelic for \\"Head of Poop.\\" It wasn't supposed to be funny or clever. Ceann was only going to play one show to parody The Pogues' original name, Pogue Mahone, which means \\"kiss my ass\\". They realized that some people became hesitant to book them because of the name, so they shortened it to Ceann.Phillyist Interviews...

Description and history The Gerrish Warehouse was located on the southern shore of Kittery Point, off Pepperrell Road (Maine State Route 103) just beyond the cemetery of the First Congregational Church. The building was a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gable roof, clapboard siding, and a stone foundation, and measured about . It had large doors at its northern and southern facades, the south (water-facing) ones of simple boards, those facing north paneled. It had sash windows, with interior shutters that slid into place. Its floors consisted of plain floorboards, with access to the upper level gained by ladder stairs. The warehouse was built c. 1710, and was one part of the large shipping empire of the Pepperrell family, whose most famous member was Sir William Pepperrell, who led colonial military forces in the successful 1745 Siege of Louisbourg and was knighted for this success. Pepperrell's descendants, Loyalists during the American Revolutionary War, had their properties seized by the state and sold off. In 1797 the warehouse came into the hands of Robert Follett, whose daughter married William Thompson Gerrish. The Gerrishes converted the building into a ship chandlery, finally selling it to the Maine Maritime Museum in 1976. Although the museum developed plans to move the building to a more secure location (its foundation was being undermined by tidal erosion), these plans were not realized, and the building was subsequently demolished; its contents remain at the museum's location in Bath.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Robert McKimson. The short was released on June 9, 1962, and stars Bugs Bunny and the Tasmanian Devil. Plot The cartoon opens in a seaside town where a crate is being unloaded from a cargo ship, belonging to the Snodgrass Scientific Expedition. The crew is shown trying to carefully hoist the crate from the ship to the dock, but the net holding the crate breaks, causing it to fall and break open, releasing the Tasmanian Devil. Taz immediately scuttles the ship and, while buzzing through the water, bites a shark, causing it to jump out of the water and moan in pain. Taz then comes on shore and smells food being cooked. He sees Bugs Bunny under the pier trying to cook a meal in a kettle. Taz promptly throws Bugs into the pot, but hearing singing in the pot, opens it up. Bugs, disguised as an old man, orders Taz to close the door, but when Taz tries to look again, Bugs, disguised as a lady, slaps him and pokes him in the eyes. Angered, Taz rips the shower curtains, placed by Bugs, but once he is in the pot, he hears Bugs begging him to stop drowning him. Bugs (who was outside the pot, gargling seltzer water to imitate drowning) jackhammers the pot shut and transports the pot to a cannon, where he puts the pot inside the cannon and fires it like a cannonball into the ocean. Bugs is next seen using a rotisserie to roast carrots over an open fire when Taz catches up with him after he somehow broke out of the pot and swam out of the sea. Taz quickly ties Bugs to the rotisserie and begins to cook him over the fire. Bugs (out of picture) instructs Taz to turn him faster and as Taz complies, it is revealed that he is really turning a crank of a truck engine. Taz is run over by the truck and Bugs escapes once again. Later, as Bugs is looking at the cook book, wondering what else to cook, Taz grabs him and makes a rabbit sandwich. Before Taz can take a bite, Bugs convinces him that his only food source is a moose. Wanting to catch a moose, Taz lets go of Bugs and they go to a train tunnel, which Bugs is passing off as a moose cave. Bugs explains that once he hears a moose, he'll blow a whistle to tell Taz to go in and clobber the moose. The first time, Bugs blows his own whistle and hears a train whistle. The moment Taz rushes into the tunnel, he gets clobbered by a Northbound train. Bugs suggests that Taz face south when attacking a northbound moose, but once they hear another train approaching, Taz gets clobbered by a Southbound train. Thinking that he didn't do proper research on moose attack techniques, Bugs goes into the tunnel to look up more research. Just as Taz is starting to snap out of his daze, Bugs comes riding out of the tunnel on a real moose, that runs Taz over. Taz corners Bugs again but Bugs tricks Taz by assuming a disguise as a waiter in a restaurant and takes an order from Taz when Bugs plays a violin, Taz, starting to cry from the sad song, takes the violin and eats it. Bugs returns with a skewer with three lit dynamite sticks, which Taz promptly eats, in a display of what Bugs calls \\"atrocious table manners\\". The dynamite blows up in Taz's stomach, and Taz chases Bugs. Bugs shuts him behind a door, but Taz breaks it down. After receiving a tip that Bugs is under the door, Taz goes down it, but Bugs shuts the door, attaches a hook, and calls to some off screen men. The hook then lifts up the door, revealing Taz is trapped in a cage. Later, Taz is seen in a cage in the city zoo when Bugs attempts to take his food order again. Remembering what happened previously, Taz lowers a sign in his cage that reads \\"PLEASE DO NOT FEED THE ANIMALS.\\" Bugs then playfully wonders what made Taz lose his appetite so soon.

Knox went to Ticonderoga in November 1775 and moved 60 tonsWare (2000), p. 18 of cannon and other armaments over the course of three winter months by boat, horse, ox- drawn sledges, and manpower along poor-quality roads, across two semi-frozen rivers, and through the forests and swamps of the lightly inhabited Berkshires to the Boston area,Ware (2000), pp. 19‚Äì24N. Brooks (1900), p. 38 covering approximately 300 miles. Historian Victor Brooks has called Knox's exploit \\"one of the most stupendous feats of logistics\\" of the entire American Revolutionary War.V. Brooks (1999), p. 210 The route which he followed is now known as the Henry Knox Trail, and the states of New York and Massachusetts have erected markers along the way. Background The American Revolutionary War erupted with the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775. Benedict Arnold was a militia leader from Connecticut who had arrived with his unit in support of the Siege of Boston; he proposed to the Massachusetts Committee of Safety that Fort Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain in the Province of New York be captured from its small British garrison. One reason that he gave to justify the move was the presence of heavy weaponry at Ticonderoga. On May 3, the committee gave Arnold a Massachusetts colonel's commission and authorized the operation.Martin (1997), pp. 63‚Äì65 The idea to capture Ticonderoga had also been raised to Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys in the disputed New Hampshire Grants territory in Vermont.Martin (1997), p. 67 Allen and Arnold joined forces, and a force of 83 men captured the fort without a fight on May 10. The next day, a detachment captured the nearby Fort Crown Point, again without combat.Martin (1997), pp. 70‚Äì73 Arnold began to inventory the two forts for usable military equipment,Martin (1997), p. 76 but he was hampered by a lack of resources and conflict over command of the forts, first with Allen and then with a Connecticut militia company sent to hold the fort in June. He eventually abandoned the idea of transporting the armaments to Boston and resigned his commission.Martin (1997), pp. 80‚Äì95 Expedition planning In July 1775, George Washington assumed command of the forces outside Boston,N. Brooks (1900), p. 32 and one of the significant problems which he identified in the nascent Continental Army was a lack of heavy weaponry, which made offensive operations virtually impossible. It is not known who proposed the operation to retrieve the Ticonderoga cannons, but historians tend to credit either Henry Knox or Benedict Arnold with giving Washington the idea; regardless, Washington chose Knox for the job.See N. Brooks, p. 38, and Martin, p. 106. Henry Knox later in life Knox was a 25-year-old bookseller with an interest in military matters who served in the Massachusetts militia, and he had become good friends with Washington on his arrival at Boston. When Washington gave him the assignment, he wrote that \\"no trouble or expense must be spared to obtain them.\\"Ware (200), p. 19 On November 16, Washington issued orders to Knox to retrieve the cannons and authorized ¬£1000 for the purpose, and he wrote to General Philip Schuyler asking him to assist Knox in the endeavor.N. Brooks (1900), pp. 38‚Äì39 Washington's call for the weapons was echoed by the Second Continental Congress, and they issued Knox a colonel's commission in November‚Äîalthough it did not reach him until he returned from the expedition.N. Brooks (1900), p. 34 Knox departed Washington's camp on November 17 and traveled to New York City for supplies, reaching Ticonderoga on December 5. He shared a cabin with a young British prisoner named John Andr√© at Fort George at the southern end of Lake George. Andr√© had been taken prisoner during the Siege of Fort St. Jean and was on his way south to a prison camp. The two were of a similar age and temperament, and found much common ground to talk about.Callahan (1958), p. 39 The next time they met, however, Knox presided over the court martial which convicted and sentenced Andr√© to death for his role in Benedict Arnold's treason.Callahan (1958), p. 40 Sources The apparent route of the expedition, overlaid on a 1779 map Knox's letters and diaries provide the primary sources for much of the daily activity in this journey. His description is detailed for some of the events and dates, but there are also significant gaps, and significant portions of the journey are poorly documented, especially much of the Massachusetts section. Some of these gaps occur because Knox did not write about them, and others because pages are missing from the diary.See the diary contents at Knox (1876), pp. 322‚Äì26 Other sources confirm some of Knox's details or report additional details, but parts of the route are not known with certainty, and modern descriptions of those parts are based on what is known about Massachusetts roads at the time, including the placement of markers for the Henry Knox Trail.See the inventory record for marker 21 on the trail. Regardless, the route was more or less in the corridor of today's Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90). Albany Upon arrival at Ticonderoga, Knox immediately set about identifying the equipment to take and organizing its transport.N. Brooks (1900), p. 40 He selected 59 pieces of equipment, including cannons ranging in size from 4- to 24-pounders, mortars, and howitzers. He estimated the total weight to be transported at 119,000 pounds (about 60 tons or 54 metric tons). The largest pieces were the 24-pounders which were long and estimated to weigh over . The equipment was first carried overland from Ticonderoga to the northern end of Lake George, where most of the train was loaded onto a scow-like ship called a gundalow. On December 6, the gundalow set sail for the southern end of the lake, with Knox sailing ahead in a small boat. Ice was already beginning to cover the lake, but the gundalow reached Sabbath Day Point, after grounding once on a submerged rock. They sailed on again the next day, with Knox going ahead. He reached Fort George in good time, but the gundalow did not appear when expected. A boat went to check on its progress and reported that the gundalow had foundered and sunk not far from Sabbath Day Point. This appeared to be a serious setback at first, but Knox's brother William, captain of the gundalow, reported that she had foundered but her gunnels were above the water line, and that she could be bailed out. This was done, the ship was refloated, and the gundalow arrived at the southern end of the lake two days later.Ware (2000), p. 20 General Philip Schuyler On December 17, 1775, Knox wrote to Washington that he had built \\"42 exceeding strong sleds, and have provided 80 yoke of oxen to drag them as far as Springfield\\",Ware (2000), pp. 21‚Äì22 and that he hoped \\"in 16 or 17 days to be able to present your Excellency a noble train of artillery\\". He then set out for Albany ahead of the train, crossed the frozen Hudson River at Glens Falls, and proceeded on through Saratoga to reach Lansingburg, New York on Christmas Day. Two feet (0.6 m) of snow fell that day, slowing his progress, as the snow-covered route needed to be broken open. He finally reached Albany the next day, again slowed by significant snow on the ground. There he met with General Philip Schuyler, and the two of them worked over the next few days to locate and send north equipment and personnel to assist in moving the train south from Lake George. The snowfall was sufficient to enable sleds to move the train overland, but the river ice was still too thin to move it over the Hudson. Knox and his men tried to accelerate the process of thickening the river ice by pouring additional water on top of existing ice. The first of the cannon arrived at Albany by January 4, but some cannons crashed through the ice into the river on the way to Albany, and again on crossing the Hudson heading east toward Massachusetts. In every instance, however, the cannon was recovered. On January 9, the last of cannons had crossed the Hudson, and Knox rode ahead to oversee the next stage of the journey.Knox (1867), pp. 323‚Äì324. Callahan (1958), pp. 46‚Äì50 Crossing the Berkshires 19th-century drawing depicting the arrival of the weapons Details are sketchy concerning the remaining journey, as Knox's journal ends on January 12. He reached the vicinity of Claverack, New York on January 9, 1776 and proceeded through the Berkshires, reaching Blandford, Massachusetts two days later.Knox (1867), p. 325 There the lead crew refused to continue owing to a lack of snow and the upcoming steep descent to the Connecticut River valley, but Knox hired additional oxen and persuaded the crew to go on. As the train moved east, news of it spread and people came out to watch it pass. In Westfield, Massachusetts, Knox loaded one of the big guns with powder and fired it to the applause of the assembled crowd.Ware (2000), p. 24 At Springfield, Knox had to hire new work crews, as his New York-based crews wanted to return home.Callahan (1958), p. 54 John Adams reported seeing the artillery train pass through Framingham, Massachusetts on January 25, and Knox arrived in Cambridge two days later and personally reported to Washington that they had arrived. According to Knox's accounting, he spent ¬£521 on an operation that he had hoped would take two weeks but actually took ten weeks.Drake (1873), p. 23 Arrival Washington wanted to end the siege, and he formulated a plan to draw at least some of the British out of Boston once the equipment began to arrive, at which point he would launch an attack on the city across the Charles River. He placed cannons from Ticonderoga at Lechmere's Point and Cobble Hill in Cambridge, and on Lamb's Dam in Roxbury.V. Brooks (1999), p. 224 These batteries opened fire on Boston on the night of March 2, 1776, while preparations were made to fortify the Dorchester Heights from which cannons could threaten both the city and the British fleet in the harbor. Continental Army troops occupied this high ground on the night of March 4.French (1911), p. 406V. Brooks (1999), p. 225 evacuation of British troops from Bostonalt=A black and white engraving, with horsemen on the left and workmen on the right. Behind them are the waters of a harbor with sailing ships at anchor. British General William Howe first planned to contest this move by assaulting the position, but a snowstorm prevented its execution. After further consideration, he decided instead to withdraw from the city. On March 17, British troops and Loyalist colonists boarded ships and sailed for Halifax, Nova Scotia.V. Brooks (1999), pp. 228‚Äì230 Henry Knox went on to become the chief artillery officer of the Continental Army, and later served as the first United States Secretary of War.Drake (1873), pp. 21, 127 Legacy The states of New York and Massachusetts both placed historical markers along the route that Knox was believed to have taken at the time of its sesquicentennial (150th anniversary). In 1972, markers were moved in New York when new information surfaced about the train's movements between Albany and the state boundary. Most of the markers in Massachusetts are along a route that the train was assumed to take, given the sparsity of documentation and what was known about roads in Massachusetts at the time.Knox Trail official New York site Fort Knox, an Army post in Kentucky famous as the site of the United States Bullion Depository was named after Henry Knox.

Each colored section represents one of the GPU's frame buffer and each color change represents a frame buffer swap. Assuming a 60 Hz refresh rate, a benchmark tool may report this as 144 frames per second. However, the user will perceive less due to some frames existing for a tiny fraction of a display's refresh cycle. Micro stuttering is a term used in computing to describe a quality defect that manifests as irregular delays between frames rendered by the GPU(s), causing the instantaneous frame rate of the longest delay to be significantly lower than the frame rate reported by benchmarking applications, such as 3DMark, as they usually calculate the average frame rate over a longer time interval. In lower frame ratesUnder which frame rate the effects of micro stuttering becomes apparent varies depending on numerous variables and how sensitive the human test- subject is. The worst-case scenario would be that the frames from all GPUs finish rendering at the same time, in such a case the frame rate perceived by the viewer would be half of the reported average frame rate in the case of a dual-card configuration, and just a fourth in a quad-GPU configuration. when this effect may be apparent the moving video appears to stutter, resulting in a degraded gameplay experience in the case of a video game, even though the frame rate seems high enoughThe generally accepted average frame rate for a smooth experience varies from game to game and user to user but is generally 30-60 frame/second and higher to provide a smooth experience. Single-GPU configurations do not suffer from this defect in most cases and can in some cases output a subjectively smoother video compared to a multi-GPU setup using the same video card model. Micro stuttering is inherent to multi-GPU configurations using alternate frame rendering (AFR), such as nVidia SLi and AMD CrossFireX but can also exist in certain cases in single-gpu systems. The effects of micro stuttering varies depending on the application and driver optimizations. Beyond dual-GPU setups, CrossFireX/SLI setups do not seem to be as affected by micro-stuttering; the frame rate variability in a three-way CrossFireX/SLI setup approaches the smoothness achieved by a single GPU. As of May 2012, with the latest release of hardware and drivers from nVidia and AMD, AMD's Radeon HD 7000 series is severely more affected by micro stuttering than nVidia's GeForce 600 Series. In tests performed in Battlefield 3, a configuration with two GeForce GTX 680 in SLi-mode showed a 7% variation in frame delays, compared to 5% for a single GTX 680. A configuration with two Radeon HD 7970 in CrossFireX-mode, on the other hand, showed an 85% variation in frame delays, compared to 7% for a single card, indicating large amounts of micro stuttering. These results are reflected in the perceptual experience when looking at the video in output. The software program RadeonPro can be used to significantly reduce or eliminate the effects of micro-stuttering when using AMD graphics cards in CrossFire.

Purdy, Don: AeroCrafter - Homebuilt Aircraft Sourcebook, page 166. BAI Communications. The original Freebird I design was further refined and developed and was produced until late 2014 by Free Bird Innovations of Detroit Lakes, Minnesota as the LiteSport Ultra. Development The Freebird I was developed from the two- seater Freebird II that had been introduced at Sun 'n Fun 1996. The single seater was introduced in 1998 and retains the configuration and many features of the two seater, but with a revised, narrower fuselage. The aircraft was intended to meet the requirements of the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category, including that category's maximum empty weight. The Freebird I is constructed from bolted aluminum tubing, covered with doped aircraft fabric. The aircraft features conventional three-axis controls, including a trim system. The tricycle landing gear is steered by differential braking and a castering nosewheel. The company estimated that an average builder would take 120 hours to build the aircraft from the assembly kit. The standard engine recommended is the two-stroke Rotax 447 and with this engine the standard empty weight is . The Freebird I's wings can be folded in five minutes by one person and the aircraft can then be trailered or stored. Options available included full cabin doors, flaperons, brakes, wheel pants and a custom-fitted trailer. The original Freebird I has been replaced in the company line by the improved LiteSport Ultra. A new variant, the Freebird 103, using the same wing with a redesigned fuselage, was under development in 2009.

He was appointed by Pedro de la Gasca, the \\"Peacemaker,\\" to found the city to commemorate the peace in the Peruvian colonies after the defeat of the Pizarro brothers. Early life Alonso de Mendoza was born between 1471 and 1476 in Garrovillas de Alcon√©tar (C√°ceres, Spain). He left the peninsula attracted by the news about the wealth of the New World, and by the Adventures of Pizarro and Almagro, who had conquered the Inca empire. New World Alonso de Mendoza fought as a soldier in Germany and Italy before moving to the New World. It is believed that he settled in Cuba when Diego Vel√°zquez de Cu√©llar was the governor, as the name of one Alonso de Mendoza appears in a document signed in Guanuco and dated 1520. Then he appears in Mexico serving under Hern√°n Cort√©s, and in San Sebasti√°n del Puerto, from where he was later banished, accused of being an agitator. Peru Later Alonso de Mendoza moved to Peru, where his natural intelligence, people skills, and personal charm opened the doors of the headquarters of Pizarro, then at war with his partner Diego de Almagro. He fought in the battle of Las Salinas, against Almagro himself, and in the battle of Chupas, where \\"Diego, the Younger\\" died in action. After these actions, he was appointed governor of Chuquisaca. During the turbulent years of Gonzalo Pizarro's rebellion against king Charles V of Spain, he seems to have acted on both sides. By the end of the rebellion he was serving under Francisco de Carvajal, the \\"Demon of the Andes\\", who made him Captain and gave him different missions in a long campaign against the royalist Diego de Centeno. Mendoza's life took another dramatic turn when he decided to serve under the orders of Pedro de la Gasca, the envoy of the King, who entrusted him with a group of chivalry in the battle of Sacsahuaman. Pedro de la Gasca, whose mission had ended in Peru with the resolution of the conflict, had decided to leave Peru, but he wanted to leave a legacy. On April 7, 1548, de la Gasca notified the Captain he was appointed to found a new city to commemorate the victory of the royal forces and the peace. By the time, too, he had taken possession of productive gold mines in the region of Tipuani. Foundation of La Paz Three priests (Francisco Morales, Francisco Laroca and Francisco Alc√≥cer) suggested Mendoza the location of the new city. Many members of the staff of the Viceroyalty of Peru, many commissioners and soldiers, priests and traders were familiar with a valley known as Chukiyawu, next to the Illimani mountain, and knew that there was a small Indian village. They had admired the beauty of the depression, a gigantic, rugged and irregular basin, with a river on the bottom. The river was called by the natives Chukiyapu or Choqueyapu (Golden River). Mendoza prepared the documents for the foundation to take place on October 20, 1548, but the authorities could not arrive in time, so the captain proceeded to a provisional act of foundation in the site of the Indian village of Laja or Laxa, in the Andean plains. Three days later, the official ceremony was held in the actual location. Morales, Laroca and Alc√≥cer provided the general design for the city. Nuestra Se√±ora de La Paz became part of the route that connected Lima to Potos√≠, the city built around the richest silver mine in the world. It was also part of the route to the goldfields of Tipuani, and the subtropical zone of Yungas. The site was well chosen, not only because it offered many advantages but also because it offered a good place for \\"Pascana\\" (rest and comfort) for travelers. Death In 1549 Alonso de Mendoza was commissioned to fight an Indian uprising in Potos√≠. It is unclear if he returned to Chuquisaca before his death in Tipuani. Popular culture ‚Äì A commemorative statue in honor of Alonso de Mendoza can be seen in La Paz, in the site where he founded the city, known then by the natives as Churupampa (Field of Shells). Part of downtown La Paz, its current name is Plaza Alonso de Mendoza. ‚Äì In La Garrovilla (Badajoz), the main plaza is called Alonso de Mendoza. ‚Äì The town of Garrovillas (C√°ceres) has named a street \\"Capit√°n Mendoza\\" after him. ‚Äì In 2003, a Metro station (Line 12) in Madrid, Spain, was named after Captain Alonso de Mendoza.

Initially raised in 1921 as the 2nd Cavalry Brigade in New South Wales, it was a part-time formation of the Militia. It consisted of three light horse regiments spread across several depots across the Hunter Valley and northern part of the state. During World War II, the brigade was mobilised for defensive duties in December 1941, and assumed positions along the northern coast to defend against a possible invasion. In early 1942, the brigade was converted into a motorised formation, and was redesignated as the 2nd Motor Brigade. In April 1943, when the threat of invasion had passed, it was disbanded and its manpower reallocated. History The brigade was established as a formation of the part-time Militia in 1921, with the designation of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade. Based in regional New South Wales, it was headquartered in West Maitland and consisted of three light horse regiments ‚Äì the 12th, 15th and 16th. These units were based in depots in the Hunter Valley and the northern part of the state including Armidale, Casino and West Maitland, with troops being drawn from the areas that had previously been assigned to the disbanded 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades. By 1938, the brigade had been reduced to two regiments: the 12th/24th and 15th. It formed part of the 1st Cavalry Division, which was headquartered in Sydney. During World War II, the brigade was mobilised for full-time service in December 1941 after Japan's entry into the war. At this time, the brigade's headquarters was located at Armidale, and in the event of an invasion was tasked with defending positions along the northern coast, and preventing an enemy force from advancing inland towards the Central Tablelands. The brigade's units were dispersed as follows: the 12th Light Horse Regiment at Armidale, the 15th Motor Regiment at Coffs Harbour, and the 24th Light Horse Regiment and 1st Machine Gun Regiment at Rutherford. This lasted until January 1942 when the brigade was re-oriented towards a flank defence role in support of the garrison covering Newcastle. This resulted in the headquarters moving to Gloucester while the 24th Light Horse moved firstly to Bulahdelah and then Stroud, with the 1st Machine Gun Regiment taking over positions around Dungog. It did not see any active service at this time and was converted into the 2nd Motor Brigade in March 1942, as part of an effort to motorise or mechanise Australia's mounted forces in the early war years. The new brigade was assigned to the 1st Australian Motor Division, and was placed under the command of Brigadier W.E.H. Pascoe. At this time, each of the brigade's light horse regiments was converted into a motor regiment; such units were authorised to operate 14 scout cars and 44 Universal carriers. Following the arrival of the 1st Motor Division's headquarters in Rutherford, the 2nd Motor Brigade headquarters moved to Dungog, co-located with the 1st Motor Regiment, while the 24th Motor Regiment remained at Stroud. The 16th Motor Regiment at Newcastle temporarily came under brigade's command until it was sent to Gympie, Queensland, to reinforce the 1st Motor Brigade in April 1942. In May 1942, the armoured forces were restructured, and the 2nd Motor Brigade lost the 1st Motor Regiment, which became the 1st Army Tank Battalion and was reassigned to the 3rd Army Tank Brigade. Meanwhile, the 24th Motor Regiment was disbanded. Brigade headquarters moved to Taree, where it was re- formed. With the disbandment of the 4th Motor Brigade, two of its motor regiments ‚Äì the 6th and 7th ‚Äì joined the 2nd Motor Brigade moving to Kempsey and Taree respectively. Meanwhile, the 12th Motor Regiment re-joined the brigade, although it remained at Coffs Harbour until July when the 1st Motor Division's headquarters moved there, freeing up the 12th to move further south, around Kempsey, so that it could concentrate closer to brigade headquarters. This resulted in the 6th Motor Regiment moving to Taree at this time. In late 1942, the Australian government sought to raise two Militia armoured divisions ‚Äì the 2nd and 3rd. These formations were to be established on the light scale, to complement the 1st Armoured Division, which had been raised as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force. The brigade was assigned to the 2nd Armoured Division, and a significant restructure took place. The 6th Motor Regiment was converted into an armoured car regiment and became a divisional asset, while the 12th Motor Regiment also became an armoured car regiment and was transferred to the 3rd Armoured Division, and the 7th Motor Regiment was disbanded. To replace these losses, the 2nd Motor Brigade received the 15th, 17th and 20th Motor Regiments. These units moved to Wallgrove in November 1942 as part of their concentration prior to joining the 2nd Armoured Division. In February 1943, the brigade moved to Gherang, Victoria, but around this time the 20th Motor Regiment was sent to Queensland to reinforce the 2nd Armoured Brigade and the 15th Motor Regiment was sent to Western Australia to join the 1st Armoured Brigade. This left just the 17th Motor Regiment and the brigade's headquarters in Victoria. The brigade did not see any active service and was disbanded at Gherang, Victoria, in April 1943, as part of a draw down of Australia's armoured forces that was undertaken once the threat of an invasion had passed. At this time, the Australian government decided to reallocate some of the manpower that had been tied up in the armoured divisions to other formations that would be used for jungle warfare, or to civilian industry. One of the brigade's former units, the 20th Motor Regiment, was subsequently deployed to Merauke, in Dutch New Guinea, as part of Merauke Force to undertake defensive duties. In February 1945, the 20th Motor Regiment was converted into a pioneer battalion and was renamed the 20th Pioneer Battalion. Of the four companies subsequently raised, No. 3 Pioneer Company served in New Guinea before the end of the war.

It is the sequel to The Summoning.http://www.kelleyarmstrong.com/the-awakening-2/ Plot The Awakening takes place directly after the events in The Summoning. Chloe has been recaptured by The Edison Group, a team of supernatural scientists responsible for manipulating her DNA, therefore enhancing her necromantic abilities. While there, she discovers that she, and other supernaturals are experimental subjects who were genetically modified at birth. Chloe and Victoria Enright (Tori, a witch) lead the Edison Group to a factory where they were supposed to meet Derek and Simon. Chloe and Tori escape with help from Liz after struggling with Tori's mother, Diane (also a witch), but not before Diane hits Chloe's aunt Lauren with a seemingly fatal spell. The two girls run and hide. Chloe reads a letter her Aunt Lauren gave her which explains that she only ever wanted to help young supernaturals but it wasn't until her own niece was in danger that she realized how dangerous the Edison Group was. The letter also reveals that Chloes mom had a brother, who died (possibly through suicide) due to a mishap with his powers. The next day, they meet up with Derek and Simon at the factory. The four of them decide to find Simon and Derek's father (Kit Bae) friend Andrew Carson, who will surely be able to give them a place to stay. He lives in New York, so they decide to take a bus and work from there. On the bus to New York City, Chloe is woken by Derek who tells her that he feels another change coming on. She offers to go with him and asks Tori to tell Simon that if they don't make it back to the bus, they will meet up in New York City. They get off the bus and find some woods near a service station, where Derek prepares for his change. Just like before, it doesn't work. He is exhausted afterwards, so Chloe tells him to get some sleep and they will get on another bus in the morning. After he falls asleep Chloe witnesses the murder of a young girl in the same patch of woods. After realising she cannot interact with it, and that it repeats over and over, she realises that it is a memory from the real murder than occurred there before. She does not sleep that night, for fear of the girl's body still being there in the woods. Finding that they don't have enough money to take the bus from where they are currently, Chloe and Derek are forced to walk and hitchhike to the next city so they will be able to buy a ticket. That night, they encounter two other wolves, Liam and Ramon, who are man-eaters, wanted by the New York Pack. They want Derek to take the blame for their crimes. However, they know that if they simply capture Derek and give him over, the Alpha might believe his cries of \\"I didn't do it\\", so try to force him into going along willingly by promising not to harm Chloe. Derek incapacitates Ramon, freeing Chloe, and they bolt. Liam catches up with them an Chloe stabs him in the thigh, and they manage to get away. The next morning, finally being close enough to New York to afford the bus fare, Chloe and Derek catch a bus and arrive at Andrew's house, where they find Tori and Simon. But Andrew himself is missing. Suspecting that Andrew has been captured, given that there is still coffee in the pot from that morning, they decide to stay only for the night. Before dawn, the Edison Group attacks them. While hiding, Chloe hears a voice that sounds like her Aunt Lauren's, guiding her to safety. She realizes with some panic that she wouldn't hear Lauren unless she was dead and wonders if The Edison Group has killed her Aunt - not realising that it is, in fact, the ghost of her mother. Chloe and Simon are approached by a man that Simon recognizes as Andrew Carson, the man they've been looking for. Andrew helps them to safety and Derek arrives with Tori. They all escape in a van and Andrew tells them that he's taking them to a safe house for supernaturals where they can rest up and eventually help take down The Edison Group. Characters Chloe Saunders is a necromancer and the narrator of The Darkest Power series and is the trilogy's main protagonist, an aspiring filmmaker wannabe who describes herself as being quite plain and unremarkable. Though she admits to at first having a crush on Simon Bae, she also shows signs of being attracted to his brother, Derek Souza with whom she ultimately becomes close to and strikes up a deep friendship. Derek Souza the Lyle House's resident werewolf, Derek is observed by Chloe as being sullen, quiet, and abrupt. Due to his sheer physical size and brute strength, Chloe finds him scary and imposing. He is the first to tell her about her supernatural abilities and she soon discovers that he is a werewolf, approaching his first change. Rachelle Rogers is an Exustio half-demon who is at Lyle House after exhibiting a fascination with fire and being diagnosed as a pyromaniac. She quickly befriends Chloe though she later betrays her, under the misguided belief that she is doing the right thing, and allies herself with the Edison Group. Simon Bae is a charismatic sorcerer who befriends Chloe. She admits to having a crush on him and he appears to share her feelings. Victoria \\"Tori\\" Enright is a minor antagonist in The Summoning though in The Awakening, she becomes an ally to Chloe as they try to escape The Edison Group. Tends to be sarcastic, and is very independent, Also it is found out in The Awakening that Victoria (Tori) is a female spellcaster also known as a witch. Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" Delaney is a friend of Chloe Saunders who was murdered by The Edison Group in The Summoning. After uncontrollable outbursts of power, Liz was removed from Lyle House and executed. Dr. Lauren Fellows is Chloe's maternal aunt who has served as a mother figure to Chloe. She is a part of the Edison Group though she has no supernatural powers. In a letter to Chloe, Lauren explains that her sister (Chloe's mother) took part in the experiment in order to lessen the chance of having a necromancer child. Her mother feared that any child she had would suffer the same fate as her brother, Ben, who was driven crazy by his powers and committed suicide (though it's possible he was driven to his death by ghosts). Dr. Marcel Davidoff is a head doctor and leading member of Project Genesis. He appears to be quite friendly and caring though he shows a particular affection for Rae. Chloe discovers that the password on his computer is Rae's birth mother's name, Jacinda, and there are hints that he may have been romantically involved with her. Diane Enright is a member of the Edison Group and is on the board of Lyle House. She is also Tori Enright's mother and a witch.

Initially raised in 1921 as the 3rd Cavalry Brigade in Victoria, it was a formation of the part-time Militia. It consisted of three light horse regiments, which were spread across several depots in regional Victoria. During World War II, the brigade was mobilised for defensive duties in December 1941 to defend against a possible invasion. In early 1942, it was converted into a motorised formation, and was redesignated as the 3rd Motor Brigade. The brigade moved to Western Australia in late 1942 and remained there until August 1944 when it was disbanded without having seen combat. History Headquartered in Melbourne, the brigade was formed in 1921 as the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, with depots across Victoria. A formation of the part-time Militia, it consisted of three light horse regiments: the 8th, 13th, and 20th. These regiments were based in Benalla, Warragul and Seymour, occupying part of the area previously assigned to the disbanded 5th and 6th Light Horse Brigades. By 1938, the brigade had been expanded to include the 4/19th, 8th, 13th, 20th and 17th (MG) Light Horse Regiments, and formed part of the 2nd Australian Cavalry Division. During the early part of World War II, the brigade was mobilised in December 1941 following Japan's entry into the war. Concentrating around Winchelsea, the brigade's constituent units were deployed to defend possible approaches to Geelong to respond in the event of an invasion. To achieve this, the 23rd/21st Infantry Battalion was deployed to Ocean Grove, the 8th Reconnaissance Battalion, was based at Mount Duneed, and the 26th Light Horse (Machine Gun) Regiment occupied the Belmont Recreation Reserve. From these positions, the brigade was tasked with linking in with two other forces ‚Äì Corangamite Force and Torquay Force ‚Äì which were to form a screen to the brigade's south and west. At the end of December 1941, brigade headquarters moved to the Geelong Racecourse. The brigade was relieved of its forward role in early 1942 when the 4th Infantry Division arrived. The 3rd Cavalry Brigade subsequently lost the 23rd/21st Infantry Battalion, and was moved into reserve positions around Lysterfield, assuming command of the 4th Light Horse, 26th Light Horse (Machine Gun) Regiment and the 1st Armoured Car Regiment. This was the first part of a reorganisation that saw the brigade being converted into the 3rd Australian Motor Brigade in March 1942, which was undertaken as part of an effort to motorise or mechanise Australia's mounted forces in the early war years. Following its motorisation, the brigade consisted of the 4th, 26th and 101st Motor Regiments. By June, the brigade had redeployed to Rowville, but this was followed by another move to Seymour in September 1942. At this time, the brigade was assigned to the 2nd Australian Motor Division in September 1942; however, in October it was re-assigned to 1st Armoured Division, which was being deployed to Western Australia as part of III Corps. The brigade's move was completed by November, with the 3rd Motor Brigade assuming positions around Mullewa. While waiting for the rest of the 1st Armoured Division to arrive, the brigade was placed into a corps reserve role, during which time they were tasked with providing manoeuvre support to several infantry brigades that were deployed between Geraldton and Strawberry, and also providing a reconnaissance capability to the north of the Northampton‚ÄìYalgoo. In March 1943, the brigade moved to Mingenew to take part in divisional training. A further move then took place in July to Dandaragan. The 1st Armoured Division was disbanded in September 1943, as part of efforts to reallocate manpower to operational units, and from then the 3rd Motor Brigade was attached to the 2nd Infantry Division. After training to prepare for combined operations, the brigade came under direct command of III Corps from April 1944, when the 2nd Infantry Division was broken up and ceased to exist. Finally, the 3rd Motor Brigade was disbanded at Chidlow, in August 1944. As a motorised formation, the brigade was initially commanded by Brigadier Kenneth McKenzie, until March 1943 when Brigadier Frank Wells took over. In June 1943, Brigadier John Clarebrough assumed command, remaining in the position until the brigade was disbanded.

The weapon was developed by Rheinmetall-Borsig under the leadership of Dipl.-Ing. Rudolf Nebel, who had pioneered German use of wing-mounted offensive rocketry in World War I with the Luftstreitkr√§fte. History The tight formations flown by USAAF heavy bombers allowed their defensive heavy machine guns to provide mutual cover to one another, and such a combat box was an extremely dangerous environment for a fighter aircraft to fly through, with dozens of heavy machine guns aimed at attacking Luftwaffe fighters from almost every conceivable direction. This led to numerous efforts to develop weapons that could attack the bombers outside the nominal effective range of their defensive guns. This weapon enabled the German pilots to attack their bomber targets from a safer distance of over a kilometer, where the risk of being hit was much reduced. While a single fighter's payload of two or four such rockets was extremely unlikely to score a hit, a mass launch by an entire fighter squadron (a Staffel of 12-16 aircraft) as it arrived to intercept the bombers would likely score two or three hits, about 15% accuracy. The rocket's huge blast radius also compensated for inaccuracy, and even a non-lethal hit on a bomber by a showering of shrapnel would have psychological effects and perhaps cause it to take evasive man≈ìuvres that would drive it from the protection of its fellows. JG 1 and JG 11 were the first front line units to utilise the weapon during the spring of 1943. During the autumn of 1943 the Bf 110 G-2 Zerst√∂rer of ZG 26 and ZG 76 were also equipped with it. These weapons were also sometimes used against ground targets from late 1943 onwards, such as in the Italian campaign 1943‚Äì44, the 1944 Normandy campaign and during the Ardennes Offensive. Design and capabilities 245x245px Modified from the 21 cm Nebelwerfer 42 infantry barrage rocket projectile and reconfigured for air- launch, the spin-stabilised rocket was propelled by diglycol solid fuel, and the warhead weighed . The Wfr. Gr. 21's projectile had a velocity of per second (1,150 km/h, 716 mph) and a maximum range of . The rocket and tube weighed some in total. A time fuse detonated the warhead at a pre-set distance of to from launch point, resulting in a lethal blast area approximately wide. Usage Single seat fighters carried a single tubular launcher under each wing, while the Zerst√∂rer heavy twin engine fighters carried two under each wing. Operationally the weapon had several disadvantages; the launcher tubes produced significant air resistance, as well as reduced speed, maneuverability and general performance. Unlike the firmly attached underwing conformal gun pods carried by many Luftwaffe anti-bomber single-engined fighters, the BR 21's tube launchers were jettisonable, and once the rocket had been fired the fighter could revert to a 'clean' profile. Shortcomings The relatively low velocity of the rocket created a considerable problem in attempting to counter the resultant ballistic drop of such a slow-moving projectile, which required that the launcher tubes be mounted at a roughly 15¬∞ angle upwards from the line of flight, causing considerable drag on the airframe of the carrier aircraft. The low launch velocity and the high angle at which the rocket was launched meant that both accurate aiming and correct judgment of the target's distance were difficult. As a result, most of the rockets fired exploded either in front of or behind the bomber target. However, they did often achieve the effect of opening up the bomber formations enough for fighters to attack with conventional weapons. Aircraft armed with the Wfr.

For nearly two centuries, Grape Island was a small, but thriving community of fishermen, farmers, and clam diggers, until the land was purchased by the US Government and turned into a wildlife refuge in the middle of the 20th Century. Its last resident was Lewis Kilborn who lived his entire life on the island until his death in 1984.  Geography  Though often considered a part of Plum Island, Grape Island is separated from the larger barrier island by a creek. It can be seen from Ipswich's \\"Great Neck\\" which provides an excellent view across Plum Island Sound. It can still be accessed by boat, or perhaps less easily by land at low tide from the marshes of Plum Island State Park.  History  Local histories record that fishermen and farmers settled on Grape Island throughout the 18th Century, and like Plum Island, Grape Island had a somewhat sizeable population by the 1870s. By the late 1800s there was a hotel, operated by the MacKinney Family, a school where Grape Island's children attended class from April to November, and a number of small cottages and houses owned by seasonal and year-round residents. Some of the more prominent families on the island were the Smalls, Baileys, MacKinney's and Kilborns. Summer on the island saw additional seasonal residents and the island and its surroundings were popular with duck hunters, fishermen, lobstermen, and clammers. The island witnessed considerable decline beginning in the 1920s as more and more families left for the towns of Ipswich, Rowley, Newbury, and Newburyport and elsewhere. By the 1930s, only the Kilborn Family and one other family remained and soon thereafter the Department of the Interior took possession of the island and it became part of the Parker River National Wildlife Refuge. John Kilborn and his son Lewis Kilborn refused to leave however and paid the Government monthly rent of $10.00 a month to stay on the island. John Kilborn died in 1946, and for the next 38 years the only residents on Grape Island were Lewis Kilborn and the area's wildlife. Well known in the area, and sometimes referred to as the \\"Hermit of Grape Island\\" (a reference he hated), Lewis Kilborn continued to live on the island much like earlier generations had, collecting rain for his water supply, heating his house with a wood stove, fishing, and heading into town in his boat for groceries. He listened to the world's events through a transistor radio and would read any and all books and newspapers that friends and relatives would bring him. He died in March 1984.  Grape Island Today  Little remains of the houses, cottages, school and the hotel on Grape Island. What wasn't torn down, or removed by the Government was long ago reclaimed by nature. Numerous magazine and newspaper articles about Grape Island have appeared in Yankee Magazine, and the local papers, some of them written by former Representative John F. Dolan of Ipswich (Lewis Kilborn's nephew) who lived there as a boy in the 1920s.

A formation of the part-time Militia, the brigade was formed in 1921 as the 4th Cavalry Brigade. At this time, it consisted of three light horse regiments based in southern and western New South Wales. During World War II, the brigade was mobilised for defensive duties in December 1941, and assumed positions along the southern New South Wales coast to defend against a possible invasion. It was converted into the 4th Motor Brigade in March 1942 when it was motorised. As a motor brigade, the 4th undertook defensive duties on the south coast of New South Wales before it was converted into an armoured formation, designated the 3rd Army Tank Brigade in May 1942. History The 4th Cavalry Brigade was raised as a formation of the part-time Militia in 1921. Its headquarters was established in Paddington, New South Wales, with the brigade's area of responsibility stretching across southern and western New South Wales. At the time, it consisted of the 1st, 6th, 7th, and 21st Light Horse Regiments. By 1927, the brigade consisted of the 1st, 6th and 7th Light Horse, as the 21st had been re-assigned as divisional cavalry. These regiments were based in Parramatta, Orange and Goulburn, with troops being drawn from areas previously assigned to the disbanded 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades. By 1938, the 21st had returned to the brigade, and the 1st Light Horse had been converted to a machine gun regiment. During World War II, the brigade was assigned to the 1st Australian Cavalry Division. Following Japan's entry into the war in December 1941, the brigade was mobilised for full time service. It was concentrated at Cowra, New South Wales, initially but moved to Bowral, New South Wales, in February 1942. There, the brigade was assigned a defensive role to cover the southern New South Wales coast and in the event of an invasion was to prevent an enemy force from advancing towards the Central Tablelands. At this time, the brigade's constituent units were the 6th Motor Regiment based at Nowra, the 7th Light Horse Regiment at Dapto, the 14th Machine Gun Regiment at Berrima, and the 3rd Armoured Regiment at Goulburn and Moruya. The brigade did not see any active service and was converted into the 4th Australian Motor Brigade in March 1942, as part of ongoing efforts to motorise or mechanise Australia's mounted forces in the early war years. As a result of this, the brigade's three light horse regiments ‚Äì the 6th, 7th and 14th ‚Äì were converted into motor regiments; each regiment was authorised to operate 14 scout cars and 44 Universal carriers. It also possessed a single armoured regiment: the 3rd. They continued their previously assigned defensive role on the south coast of New South Wales. The brigade was assigned to the 1st Australian Motor Division on formation and did not see any active service. In May 1942, the brigade was converted again, this time becoming the 3rd Army Tank Brigade. When it was converted to an armoured role, one the brigade's motor regiments ‚Äì the 14th ‚Äì was disbanded while the 6th and 7th transferred to the 2nd Motor Brigade. The 3rd Armoured Regiment was converted into the 3rd Army Tank Battalion, and joined two other such battalions, which were formed to provide close support to infantry in combat. The 3rd Army Tank Brigade moved to Largs, and the brigade's positions on the southern New South Wales coast were re- assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division.

The game contains a main game mode, called Dream Mode, which allows the player to manage a car dealership, create their own cars, and participate in races with their creations.  Gameplay  In dream mode, the player finds blueprints of concept cars and has to choose a logo and name for their company. While it loosely relies on a linear story, it is viewed from a first-person perspective during cut-scenes. When the player processes through a specific amount of single races and championships, the company building will improve. For an example, after completing the first championship, and a few single races, the building will transform from an old-fashioned 1950s style garage to a small organization headquarters. Whenever the company building grows, an additional character appears; from the start the player's buddy Rick assists them with most things, after the next building improvement Carla appears as a receptionist, an additional feature when unlocking Carla is more mechanics all of whom in turn assists their buddy Rick, after the second building improvement Rebecca appears. Her task is to manage the production. After the third, and last improvement Benjamin appears. He highly resembles a \\"cliche'\\" scientist and physicist. His role is to lead the designing area. Unlike many plot driven racing games, Racing Evoluzione uses \\"r&d; funds\\" as currency; when the funds reach a specific amount, a new car will be ready to be developed. There are four different car types. The first line of cars are roadsters. Each roadster has three different versions: the first version is a regular street version; the second version is an evolution version with a few improvements; the third and final version is a racing version of which it has only one colour scheme, unlike the other versions that have several different colours. The second car type is sports cars. Their improving manner is identical to the roadsters. With three versions, and improvement after improvement, and not to mention that the racing version only has got one paint job. The third line of cars are super cars; unlike the first two types, super cars only come with an evolution version and a racing version. The last line of cars are dream cars, they only come in racing versions. There are many different race tracks, sorted in four different types; city tracks, mountain tracks, racetracks, and speedways. Each track type has three locations; North America, Europe, and Asia. After every race, one of the characters will comment the player based on their performance, except for Benjamin, who only has dialogue whenever a new car is ready for production.  Reception  The game received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic, receiving a score of 76/100, based on 26 critic reviews.

It became famous during the Cold War for two mass escapes in 1961 and 1963 involving a total of 65 inhabitants ‚Äì a quarter of the village's population ‚Äì across the heavily fortified inner German border. The village is first recorded in a deed of about 1250 of Count Ulrich von Regenstein for the monastery of Kloster Beuren. The entire village became a monastic settlement in 1431, after which the villagers were required to pay tithes to support the monastery. Its monastic ties were abolished in 1809. After the end of the Second World War the village found itself just inside the Soviet occupation zone, which became the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in 1949. The village is situated in a salient of the German Thuringia, surrounded on three sides by the border with Lower Saxony. In 1952 the inner German border was fortified by the East German government, with access to the West being cut off and B√∂seckendorf being added to the high- security Schutzstreifen (\\"protective strip\\") adjoining the border. Thousands of inhabitants of the East German border region were expelled en masse in 1952 in an action, codenamed Operation Vermin (Aktion Ungeziefer), intended to rid the border villages of so-called \\"unreliable elements\\". In 1961, rumours of a new wave of mass expulsions began circulating in B√∂seckendorf. Many inhabitants, particularly farmers who had resisted the forced collectivization policies of the GDR regime, feared that they were on Stasi blacklists of those slated for expulsion. On the night of 2 October 1961, 53 people from twelve families ‚Äì 16 men, 14 women and 23 children ‚Äì fled from B√∂seckendorf across the border without being detected by the East German border guards. Their escape was celebrated in the West. Although the border was mined to prevent further escapes, a second mass escape occurred at B√∂seckendorf on 22 February 1963. Twelve people from two village families crossed the border successfully, led by a GDR border guard who was engaged to one of the escapees. He was able to guide the villagers across the border at a point that he knew was free of landmines. In March 1963 the West German authorities announced that they would build a new village for the escapees, to be named Neub√∂seckendorf (New B√∂seckendorf), located about from the original village. On 24 September 2009, the German television channel Sat.1 broadcast B√∂seckendorf - Die Nacht, in der ein Dorf verschwand (\\"B√∂seckendorf - The night on which a village vanished\\"), a dramatised version of the 1961 mass escape.

However, he ended his campaign in March 2014, citing unfavorable polling and the surge of fellow candidate Tom Wolf. His campaign supported the immediate legalization of medical marijuana by allowing doctors to prescribe marijuana for treatment of appropriate conditions and illnesses as is done in 20 other states. He supported removing criminal penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana as soon as possible, and proposed to later legalize, regulate, and tax recreational marijuana in Pennsylvania.

The company debuted December 2006 with an original performance of The Nutcracker. LAB has staged the Balanchine repertory, classical ballets and new works. A key component of Los Angeles Ballet's mission is to \\"tour\\" Los Angeles. While rehearsals take place at the Los Angeles Ballet Center, LAB regularly performs across the County at five rotated venues including Royce Hall UCLA, Alex Theatre in Glendale, Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center, Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts and the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.  Artistic Directors  Thordal Christensen was a former principal dancer for and artistic director of the Royal Danish Ballet, with Neary appointed as the ‚Äòfirst ballet mistress‚Äô in charge of their productions. Colleen Neary was a principal dancer with Pacific Northwest Ballet and a Soloist with New York City Ballet under George Balanchine, and is currently a repetiteur for The George Balanchine Trust. Both Christensen and Neary are also former principal dancers for Pacific Northwest Ballet.  History  In 1974, a company titled Los Angeles Ballet was founded under the direction of John Clifford, a former principal dancer with New York City Ballet. Eleven years later, in 1985, financial woes forced Clifford's company to close. After two decades, a new Los Angeles Ballet was established by Co- Artistic Directors Thordal Christensen and Colleen Neary, as a new and completely separate entity. Choreographed by Christensen and Neary, Los Angeles Ballet debuted in December 2006 with its original production of The Nutcracker, featuring costumes from a Royal Danish Ballet production commissioned by Mr. Christensen during his tenure as that company's artistic director, complemented by a Southern California-themed set designed by Catherine Kanner. LAB's repertoire focuses on works and styles intimately known to, and mastered by, the artistic directors: Balanchine masterpieces as staged by Colleen Neary, and the revered Bournonville ballets as imparted by Thordal Christensen. As a r√©p√©titeur for The George Balanchine Trust, Ms. Neary is one of the rarified few charged with carrying on the Balanchine legacy and genius. Balanchine's mentorship of Colleen as a young dancer and as a r√©p√©titeur results in LAB's stellar interpretation of his masterworks. In 2009 LAB presented Bournonville's La Sylphide, its first full-length classical story ballet after The Nutcracker. In addition to performing the beloved classical ballet standards such as Giselle,Swan Lake, Don Quixote, Romeo and Juliet, and The Sleeping Beauty, Los Angeles Ballet has commissioned 15 new works, one developed out of LAB's Choreographic Workshop. The purpose of the workshop is to identify and nurture Southern Californian choreographic talent. In 2017 Los Angeles Ballet Orchestra, under the direction of internationally renowned conductor Andrea Quinn debuted with The Nutcracker at Dolby Theatre.  Los Angeles Ballet Center  Situated at LA's Westside, the LA Ballet Center encompasses the Los Angeles Ballet and the Los Angeles Ballet School. The center spans 12,000 square feet incorporating three studios. The company commenced with 21 dancers, later the company has ranged from 21-37 dancers each year. The LAB has regularly toured the LA County . LAB holds auditions in Seattle, L.A. and New York City. If selected, company members are offered 25-week contracts. At the end of nine seasons it presented 28 productions encompassing 50 works, including 15 commissioned world premieres.  LAB Outreach Programs  Starting from the foundation of the LAB in 2006, the school has developed multiple charity and arts programs. The ‚ÄúPower of Performance‚Äù program provides free tickets to disadvantaged children, seniors, veterans, and their families. The LAB also sponsors ‚ÄòA Chance to Dance Community Day‚Äô event launched in October 2012. Being an all ages event, the public is encouraged to participate in free ballet, hip-hop, Yoga, Pilates and various other dance/fitness classes. The program intakes roughly 200 participants every year. The school runs a Choreographic Workshop, to identify Southern California choreographic talent.

The episode originally broadcast in the United States on the Kids WB! block for The CW on May 3, 2008. The episode details Dr. Otto Octavius as an accidental laboratory incident caused by the Green Goblin where the radiation merges special mechanical tentacles to his skin and seemingly damaged his brain (although it was later suggested that what was interpreted as brain damage was in fact his mind rewiring itself to accommodate four extra limbs), and turns him from a timid and weak scientist into the villain Dr. Octopus. \\"Reaction\\" was directed by Jennifer Coyle and was the first episode of the series to be written by Randy Jandt. While writing the teleplay, Jandt was challenged with staying true to the original material of Spider-Man, particularly towards that of Dr. Octopus. \\"Reaction\\" received generally positive reviews, with television critics singling out Dr. Octopus' portrayal. Octopus's character design was applauded by both the designers and Coyle; the latter noted that his design allowed her to direct them freely in different manners, and that the arms in particular were particularly well-done. Peter MacNicol voiced the character and used a voice inspired by that of late actor Laird Cregar. It is available on both the third volume DVD set for the series, as well as the complete season box set. Plot summary Dr. Otto Octavius tries to complain to his boss Norman Osborn about the dangers of several recent experiments they have been performing to create super villains in his laboratory, but is quickly berated by Osborn for his \\"whining.\\" Octavius backs down and goes to work inside an experimentation chamber while Osborn departs. Unbeknown to him, the villain Green Goblin sneaks into the lab, activating the chamber's generators while locking Octavius inside. While unsuccessfully trying to escape from the chamber, the radiation emitted fuses the mechanical tentacles he is wearing into his skin. Osborn and others arrive on the scene to turn off the generator, while Spider- Man jumps in to help get Octavius out of the wreckage. When the doctor wakes up, he attacks Osborn with his tentacles and pins him to a wall. When Spider- Man tries to intervene, Octavius brushes him aside as well with one of his tentacles, declaring himself \\"Dr. Octopus.\\" He steals a power battery to recharge his tentacles and storms out of the building, using his tentacles as extra limbs. The next day, Peter, Gwen, Harry and some of Harry's new popular friends go to Coney Island, where Harry impresses everyone with his newfound strength. Liz Allan begins to attach herself to Peter and the two have a fun time. However, Peter spots Dr. Octopus and abandons the group to pursue him as Spider-Man. Spider-Man follows Dr. Octopus to TriCorp, where he attempts to steal a power pack from a vault. Spider-Man swoops in and gets to the power source before him. He then runs out, with Dr. Octopus pursuing him, hoping to cause the doctor to run out of energy. They reach Coney Island through their ensuing brawl and Octopus, aware of Spider-Man's desire to save innocent lives, kidnaps Liz. With only an hour of energy left, he climbs to the top of a roller coaster, forcing Spider-Man to choose between the power pack and Liz. Spider-Man throws the pack in the air before rescuing Liz; he gets close to Dr. Octopus as the latter scrambles for the power pack and is able to take it away from him, successfully defeating the doctor. When Peter returns to the group, he discovers that Liz is breaking up with her boyfriend Flash Thompson after he gets jealous that she spent the day so close to Peter. Sally blames Peter for it and runs to comfort Liz. Gwen approaches Peter, and the two agree they need to have a talk with Harry about his belligerent attitude towards them and constant strange behavior. Production Peter MacNicol based his performance as Dr. Octopus on Laird Cregar (pictured). \\"Reaction\\" was written by Randy Jandt and directed by Jennifer Coyle. It originally aired on the Kids WB! block for The CW on May 3, 2008, at 10:00a.m. Eastern/Pacific Time, with a parental guidance rating of TV-Y7-FV. The episode's title, \\"Reaction,\\" expands the series theme \\"The Education of Peter Parker\\" chosen by developer Greg Weisman. Episodes in the third season one arc all shared a naming scheme based on chemistry. The episode was the first of the series to be penned by Jandt, who said that the opportunity to work on the series was \\"both thrilling and a bit daunting, primarily because of the elevated expectations of such a high- profile, established franchise.\\" To meet these expectations, he followed a simplistic strategy‚Äî\\"be mindful of the history, listen to the direction and guidance of Greg Weisman, and then write an episode with a good, entertaining story that is packed with as much action and humor as 22 minutes will allow.\\" Writing for Dr. Octopus in particular was difficult for the first-time writer as he had \\"such a range of character.\\" \\"Reaction\\" marked the first appearance of Dr. Otto Octavius as Dr. Octopus. Coyle noted her enthusiasm for the character, particularly towards his design; she has given noteworthy praise towards his arms, as they \\"are amazing, and the timing has been really good for this show, so much so that I think you feel the impact of those arms.\\" Coyle also believes that people can connect with the character on different levels. Similarly, Sean Galloway‚Äîa character designer on the series‚Äîsaid that he is \\"probably one of [his] favorites\\" to have designed. Peter MacNicol was cast to play Dr. Octopus. MacNicol had starred in primetime television series, including Chicago Hope, Numb3rs, and Boston Legal, while also being a veteran to the voice acting profession on animated series such as The Wild Thornberrys and Buzz Lightyear of Star Command. MacNicol chose to base Dr. Octopus' voice on that of Laird Cregar, a 1940s actor who, throughout his short-lived career, was challenged with obesity, until he lost too much weight and died at age 30. MacNicol, though, notes that he is \\"no mimic and it was Cregar's quality rather than his voice which gave me my model.\\" \\"Reaction\\" became available on the DVD The Spectacular Spider-Man, Volume 3, on March 17, 2009, alongside the episodes \\"Catalysts\\" and \\"The Uncertainty Principle.\\" The volume featured episodes that detailed Green Goblin as a prominent or supporting character. \\"Reaction\\" also became available on the full season DVD box set entitled The Spectacular Spider-Man: The Complete First Season DVD, which featured every other episode of season one for the series. Reception \\"Reaction\\" received a generally positive response from critics. Eric Goldman of IGN, giving the episode an 8.2. rating (\\"Impressive\\"), wrote favorably, noting that the depiction Dr. Octopus \\"was very clever ‚Äì on one hand, he was a pitiful, cowering pushover. But when Norman was berating him we got a brief look at the anger within, as he imagined attacking Norman with his robotic tentacles.\\" Goldman applauded both Dr. Octopus' line, \\"I've been good\\" and when Spider-Man crashes into several stuffed animals, only to be pulled out by Dr. Octopus in a manner similar to a carnival game; he concluded that, \\"This show continues to leave several prime time live-action shows to shame when it comes to building serialized stories and has been one of the most pleasant surprises of the TV season.\\" Luke Bonanno of Ultimate Disney listed \\"Reaction\\" as one of his top five favorite episodes of the first season, while commenting that \\"the uniform excellence of the lot [makes] this a challenging task.\\" Writing for DVD Talk, reviewer Justin Felix opined that the episode was \\"particularly action-packed.\\" Rob M. Worley of Mania described Dr. Octopus' introduction as \\"explosive,\\" while praising MacNicol for balancing such a heavy workload between both the episode and other series.

History The company began in 1974 in Berkeley, CA with two ships. In 1980 the original owner, Ward Proescher, sold the business to Terry MacRae and P. Michael Watson. Proescher later went on to start a competing charter yacht company in the Bay Area, Commodore Cruises. By acquiring existing charter yacht companies, Hornblower was able to expand into San Diego in 1984, followed by Newport Beach in 1987. Shortly thereafter the company acquired the Marina del Rey-based Marina Cruise Lines. By 1989 the company operated in Berkeley, San Francisco, San Diego, Newport Beach and Marina del Rey. The corporate headquarters were (and continue to be) located on the historic ferry Santa Rosa, which is moored at Pier 3 in San Francisco. In 1992 Terry MacRae became the sole owner of Hornblower Yachts, Inc, which was rebranded as Hornblower Cruises & Events to more accurately reflect the products and services offered. In 1996 Hornblower Marine Services (HMS) was created to fill a need as a consultant to the booming riverboat casino and ferry service operations industry. By 2003, HMS grew to 80 employees, with offices in San Francisco, New London, Boston and Jacksonville. Three year later, HMS had become the leading worldwide provider of high-speed ferry services. In 2019 Hornblower Cruises & Events acquired Entertainment Cruises and all the operations encompassing it. The purchase of Entertainment Cruises doubled the amount of ships and locations that Hornblower operates. In October of the same year, Hornblower acquired British tour boat operator City Cruises who have bases in London York and Poole https://www.citycruises.com/about- city-cruises/ https://britishmarine.co.uk/News/2019/November/Hornblower-UK- Holdings-Ltd-acquires-City-Cruises Today, Hornblower operates out of 19 different ports: San Francisco, Berkeley, Sacramento, Marina Del Rey, Long Beach, Newport Beach, San Diego, DC, Alexandria, Boston, Chicago, Norfolk, Philadelphia, Toronto, Baltimore, Port of New York and New Jersey, London, Poole and York.

California Birth Index, 1905‚Äì1995. Center for Health Statistics, California Department of Health Services, Sacramento, California. is a retired police officer, ending his career as the Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). A veteran of the department with over four decades as an officer, he is known for commanding and rehabilitating the Rampart Division after the Rampart scandal; and for technology enhancements during his time as Chief of Detectives. He agreed to be interim Superintendent of Police in Chicago in late 2019 while the city searches nationwide for a replacement for retiring Eddie Johnson. Beck took helm of the Chicago Police Department on December 2, 2019 after Johnson was fired. On April 15, 2020, Beck stepped down and was replaced by former Dallas Police Department Chief David Brown, who had been nominated by Lightfoot to serve as permanent Superintendent. Early life and education Beck is a native of Long Beach, California. He attended Mayfair High School in Lakewood, California, and then the California State University, Long Beach where he received a B.A. in occupational studies-vocational arts. His father, George, was also an LAPD policeman, retiring at the rank of deputy chief in 1980. Career Beck was appointed to the Los Angeles Police Department in March 1977 after serving two years with the Los Angeles Police Reserve Corps. As a patrol officer, his assignments included both the Rampart and Hollywood divisions. After promotion to sergeant in June 1984, Beck worked in the department's controversial C.R.A.S.H. program under then-chief, Daryl Gates, in the 1980s and early 1990s. Beck worked in the department's Internal Affairs division as a sergeant and a lieutenant. He was promoted to lieutenant in April 1993, to captain in July 1999 (following that promotion he was initially assigned to Southeast Division, followed by terms as the Commanding Officer of Juvenile Division, Central Area and finally Rampart Area), and then commander in April 2005. In August 2006, he achieved the rank of deputy chief, the same rank that his father, a retired Los Angeles police officer, had attained. Upon that promotion, he assumed command of Operations-South Bureau. Beck went on to become chief of detectives, and implemented a number changes to the Detective Bureau, particularly in the use of technology (for which the Detective Bureau has overall responsibility for the entire LAPD). Beck was appointed chief of police in November 2009. According to the Los Angeles Times, Beck was paid a salary of $297,000 in 2011. Beck and California Attorney General Kamala Harris celebrate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 During the 2013 manhunt of Christopher Dorner, eight Los Angeles police officers fired 103 rounds at two innocent women who were delivering newspapers; one woman, a 71-year-old, was shot twice in the back, and the other woman was injured by broken glass. Even though a commission found that the eight officers violated department policy, none were suspended or fired; Beck chose to allow the shooting officers to return to duty after undergoing additional training. In a settlement, the two women shot by police received $4.2 million from the City of Los Angeles; Beck described the shooting \\"a tragic misinterpretation\\" by police working under \\"incredible tension.\\"Michael Winter, 2 women hurt during L.A. manhunt to receive $4.2M, USA Today (April 23, 2013). On April 17, 2015, California Attorney General Kamala Harris announced a statewide program of anti-bias training for law enforcement officers. Beck said removing built-in bias among officers \\"is not something you get inoculated against once in your life and that‚Äôs it. This takes constant retraining, constant discussion.\\" Beck and Harris had established a close working relationship. LAPD spokesman Josh Rubenstein stated that \\"Beck assigned a security detail for US Senator Kamala Harris shortly before she was sworn into office in 2017, based on a threat assessment he believed to be credible.\\" On January 19, 2018, Beck announced his retirement later that year. On June 4 of that year, Mayor Garcetti announced that Michel Moore would succeed him on June 27. On November 8, 2019 Chicago's mayor, Lori Lightfoot, appointed retired LAPD chief Charlie Beck as the city's interim superintendent, to commence upon the retirement of incumbent Eddie Johnson. Lightfoot praised Beck and said he \\"stood firmly on the side of immigrant rights in the face of opposition related to Los Angeles' status as a Sanctuary City, and its choices related to non-cooperation with federal immigration officials.\\" Chicago will conduct a nationwide search for the permanent Superintendent. Beck declined a permanent position, and agreed to hold the Office for a few months. On April 2, 2020, Beck was replaced by former Dallas Police Department Chief David Brown as Superintendent.

It is a special form of countertransference stimulated by exposure to the client's traumatic material. Its hallmark is disrupted spirituality, or a disruption in the trauma workers' perceived meaning and hope. The term was coined specifically with reference to the experience of psychotherapists working with trauma survivor clients. Others, including Saakvitne, Gamble, Pearlman, and Lev (2000) have expanded its application to a wide range of persons who assist trauma survivors, including clergy, front-line social workers, justice system professionals, health care providers, humanitarian workers, journalists, and first responders. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of vicarious trauma align with the symptoms of primary, actual trauma. When helping professionals attempt to connect with their clients/victims emotionally, the symptoms of vicarious trauma can create emotional disturbance such as feelings of sadness, grief, irritability and mood swings. The signs and symptoms of vicarious trauma parallel those of direct trauma, although they tend to be less intense. Workers who have personal trauma histories may be more vulnerable to VT, although the research findings on this point are mixed.For a review of this literature, see Common signs and symptoms include, but are not limited to, social withdrawal; mood swings; aggression; greater sensitivity to violence; somatic symptoms; sleep difficulties; intrusive imagery; cynicism; sexual difficulties; difficulty managing boundaries with clients; and core beliefs and resulting difficulty in relationships reflecting problems with security, trust, esteem, intimacy, and control. Contributing factors Vicarious trauma, conceptually based in constructivist self-development theory, arises from an interaction between individuals and their situations. This means that the individual helper's personal history (including prior traumatic experiences), coping strategies, and support network, among other things, all interact with his or her situation (including work setting, the nature of the work s/he does, the specific clientele served, etc.), to give rise to individual expressions of vicarious trauma. This in turn implies the individual nature of responses or adaptations to VT as well as individual ways of coping with and transforming it. Anything that interferes with the helper's ability to fulfill his/her responsibility to assist traumatized clients can contribute to vicarious trauma. Many human service workers report that administrative and bureaucratic factors that impediment to their effectiveness influence work satisfaction. Negative aspects of the organization as a whole, such as reorganization, downsizing in the name of change management and a lack of resources in the name of lean management, contribute to burned-out workers. Vicarious trauma has also been attributed to the stigmatization of mental health care among service providers. Stigma leads to an inability to engage in self care and eventually the service provider may reach burnout, and become more likely to experience VT. The research has also begun to show that vicarious trauma is more prominent in those with a prior history of trauma and adversity. Research indicates that a mental health provider's defense style might pose as a risk factor for vicarious traumatization. Mental health providers with self-sacrificing defense styles have been found to experience increased vicarious traumatization. Related concepts While the term \\"vicarious trauma\\" has been used interchangeably with \\"compassion fatigue\\", \\"secondary traumatic stress disorder,\\" \\"burnout,\\" \\"countertransference,\\" and \\"work-related stress,\\" there are important differences. These include the following: * Unlike compassion fatigue, VT is a theory-based construct. This means that observable symptoms can serve as the starting for a process of discovering contributing factors and related signs, symptoms, and adaptations. VT also specifies psychological domains that can be affected, rather than specific symptoms that may arise. This specificity may more accurately guide preventive measures and interventions, and allow for the accurate development of interventions for multiple domains (such as changes in the balance between psychotherapy and other work-related tasks and changes in self-care practices). * Countertransference is the psychotherapist's response to a particular client. VT refers to responses across clients, across time. * Unlike burnout, countertransference, and work-related stress, VT is specific to trauma workers. This means that the helper will experience trauma-specific difficulties, such as intrusive imagery, that are not part of burnout or countertransference. The burnout and vicarious traumatization constructs overlap, specifically regarding emotional exhaustion. A worker may experience both VT and burnout, and each has its own remedies. VT and countertransference may also co-occur, intensifying each other. * Unlike vicarious trauma, countertransference can be a very useful tool for psychotherapists, providing them with important information about their clients. * Work-related stress is a generic term without a theoretical basis, specific signs and symptoms or contributing factors, or remedies. Burnout and vicarious trauma can co-exist. Countertransference responses may potentiate vicarious trauma. * Vicarious post-traumatic growth, unlike VTF, is not a theory-based construct but rather is based on self-reported signs. * Body-centred countertransference Mechanism The posited mechanism for vicarious traumatization is empathy. Different forms of empathy may result in different effects on helpers. Batson and colleagues have conducted research that might inform trauma helpers about ways to manage empathic connection constructively. If helpers identify with their trauma survivor clients and immerse themselves in thinking about what it would be like if these events happened to them, they are likely to experience personal distress, feeling upset, worried, distressed. On the other hand, if helpers instead imagine what the client experienced, they may be more likely to feel compassion and moved to help. Measurement Over the years, people have measured VT in a wide variety of ways. Vicarious trauma is a multifaceted construct requiring a multifaceted assessment. More specifically, the aspects of VT that would need to be measured for a complete assessment include self capacities, ego resources, frame of reference (identity, world view, and spirituality), psychological needs, and trauma symptoms. Measuring of some of these elements of VT exist, including the following: * Psychological needs, using the Trauma and Attachment Belief Scale * Self capacities, using the Inner Experience Questionnaire and/or the Inventory of Altered Self-Capacities * Trauma symptoms, using the PTSD Checklist, Impact of Events Scale, Impact of Events Scale-Revised, children's revised Impact of Events Scale (Arabic Version), Trauma Symptom Inventory,Briere 1996. Detailed Assessment of Posttraumatic Stress, and/or the World Assumptions Scale Addressing Vicarious traumatization is not the responsibility of clients or systems, although institutions that provide trauma-related services bear a responsibility to create policies and work settings that facilitate staff (and therefore client) well-being. Each trauma worker is responsible for self-care, working reflectively, and engaging in regular, frequent, trauma-informed professional confidential consultation. There are many ways of addressing vicarious traumatization. All involve awareness, balance, and connection. One set of approaches can be grouped together as coping strategies. These include, for example, self-care, rest, escape, and play. A second set of approaches can be grouped as transforming strategies. Transforming strategies aim to help workers create community and find meaning through the work. Within each category, strategies may be applied in one's personal life and professional life. Organizations that provide trauma services can also play a role in mitigating vicarious trauma. Research shows that many simple things increase happiness and this aids to lessen the impact of vicarious traumatization. People who are more socially connected tend to be happier. People who consciously practice gratitude are also shown happier. Creative endeavours that are completely detached with work also increase happiness. Self-care practices like yoga, qigong, and sitting meditation are found to be helpful for those who practice. HBR in a case study regarding to traumatization stated that it is essential to create an organizational culture in which it is cool to be a social worker or a counselor, where these professionals are empowered to influence the workplace issues, the strategy of human services in both corporate and care services.

Kean ( ‚Äì 1993) was an American physician, author, researcher and Professor of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine, Benjamin H. Kean Papers Weill Cornell Medical College widely known for his treatment of the Shah of Iran. Kean was born in Valparaiso, Indiana, and grew up in West Orange, New Jersey and Manhattan. He graduated from the University of California at Berkeley, and earned a medical degree at Columbia University. Kean was an expert on tropical and rare diseases. He helped discover the cause of traveler's diarrhea and was also the personal doctor to the Shah of Iran who was in power during the 1970s. Kean was also a medical educator and author. Kean died at the age of eighty-one from colon cancer. Career summary After graduating from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, he completed his medical internship & residency at Gorgas Hospital in the Panama Canal Zone. After completion of his residency, he remained on staff at Gorgas Hospital. After the start of World War II, Kean was commissioned into the US Army Medical Corps, but remained at Gorgas Hospital, training US military physicians in tropical diseases. After the war, he was the chief health officer for the German state of Hesse during the American occupation. He reached the rank of lieutenant colonel before demobilization in 1946. After demobilization Kean began a career in academic medicine at Cornell. Famous patients and colleagues Over the years Kean worked with many famous people and leaders. He was a doctor for celebrities such as Oscar Hammerstein, Edna Ferber, Gertrude Lawrence, Martina Navratilova and Salvador Dal√≠. Kean was the personal doctor for the Shah of Iran. Arthur H. Wald, Manhattan cosmetic oral and maxillofacial surgeon, was Kean‚Äôs classmate and confidant. Other notable Columbia classmates and lifelong friends include ophthalmologist, Virginia Lubkin and psychiatrist, Walter R. Bonime. During World War II, Kean found that pilots that were shot down in the ocean were being attacked by sharks. He then discussed the dangers with President Roosevelt and as a result, shark repellent was given to pilots to prevent this danger. Controversies Kean was known for being an expert doctor on rare diseases, but also got embroiled in controversy. Over the years of working with many people he befriended Tim Garrity who was a major gambler and had ties to organized crime. Kean also became a heavy gambler, and after his bookies operation was raided in 1959, he appeared in many newspapers and had to go to court which led to the end of his gambling. He also was caught in controversy after he was alleged to have played a central role in convincing the United States to allow the deposed Shah of Iran to be admitted into the US for medical treatment. President Carter's decision to allow the Shah entry to the U.S. led to the attack on the embassy in Tehran, Iran, in which 50 hostages were taken by militant Muslims and nationalists. However, Kean denied any such role, to the point of suing the journal Science for libel. In a settlement, Science stated that he had acted both professionally and ethically. Accomplishments Although Kean was mainly known for helping cure traveler's disease, he had other accomplishments as well. In an autopsy of the writer Sherwood Anderson, Kean was able to find that the cause of death was from a colon puncture, caused by a toothpick-armed olive swallowed in a round of martinis. He also wrote 175 scientific articles and wrote six books as well. He started the tropical medicine program at Cornell Medical School, where he also became head of the parasitological laboratory. Ben Kean Medal The Ben Kean Medal is an honor awarded by the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene to a clinician or educator who impacts the people around them with the same traditions that Ben Kean first proposed. It was created in honor of Ben Kean after his death. The first recipient of the medal is his wife Colette Kean in 1994, and the first society member to receive it was Franklin A. Neva in 1995. Personal life Kean was married three times. One of his ex-wives was the dance patron and philanthropist Rebekah Harkness.

A number of writing systems have been used to transcribe the Somali language. Of these, the Somali Latin alphabet is the most widely used. It has been the official writing script in Somalia since the Supreme Revolutionary Council formally introduced it in October 1972, and was disseminated through a nationwide rural literacy campaign.Economist Intelligence Unit (Great Britain), Middle East annual review, (1975), p.229 Prior to the twentieth century, the Arabic script was used for writing Somali. An extensive literary and administrative corpus exists in Arabic script. It was the main script historically used by the various Somali sultans to keep records. Writing systems developed locally in the twentieth century include the Osmanya, Borama and Kaddare scripts. Latin script Recycling sign in Minneapolis which includes instructions written with the Somali Latin alphabet. The Somali Latin script, or Somali Latin alphabet, was developed by a number of leading scholars of Somali, including Musa Haji Ismail Galal, B. W. Andrzejewski and Shire Jama Ahmed specifically for transcribing the Somali language.. It uses all letters of the English Latin alphabet except p, v and z, and has 21 consonants and 5 vowels. There are no diacritics or other special characters, except the use of the apostrophe for the glottal stop, which does not occur word-initially. Additionally, there are three consonant digraphs: DH, KH and SH. Tone is not marked, and front and back vowels are not distinguished. Capital letters are used at the beginning of a sentence and for proper names. A number of attempts had been made from the 1920s onwards to standardize the language using a number of different alphabets. Shortly following independence and the 1960 union, the Somali Language Committee was created, headed by Somali scholar Musa Haji Ismail Galal, the first Somali professionally trained in modern phonetics. The committee recommended the use of a modified Latin script in 1962. The civilian administration at the time was unwilling to make a decision due to the controversial nature of the debate; the Latin script was seen to have been brought to the territory by colonial powers, proponents of other scripts used the phrase \\"Latin waa laa diin\\" (Latin is irreligion). Galal continued to lead Somali researchers throughout the 1960s in investigating alternative native systems of inscription suitable for use as official orthography. In 1966, a UNESCO commission of linguists led by linguist B. W. Andrzejewski added weight to the choice of the 1962 commission and picked the Latin script. The issue was still divisive and the Somali government remained hesitant. The issue was finally resolved by the military upon seizing power in 1969. An informal practice of using Latin by the army and police forces culminated in the official adoption of Latin script as the official orthography of the Somali state. Arabic script Before the arrival of the Italians and British, Somalis and religious fraternities either wrote in Arabic or used an ad hoc transliteration of Somali into Arabic script referred to as Wadaad's writing. It contains 32 letters, 10 of which are vowels. The remaining 22 are consonants. According to Bogumil Andrezewski, this usage was limited to Somali clerics and their associates, as sheikhs preferred to write in the liturgical Arabic language. Various such historical manuscripts in Somali nonetheless exist, which mainly consist of Islamic poems (qasidas), recitations and chants. Among these texts are the Somali poems by Sheikh Uways and Sheikh Ismaaciil Faarah. The rest of the existing historical literature in Somali principally consists of translations of documents from Arabic. Osmanya script The Osmanya alphabet, the most popular indigenous Somali script The Osmanya alphabet, also known as Far Soomaali (\\"Somali writing\\"), is a writing script created to transcribe the Somali language. It was invented between 1920 and 1922 by Osman Yusuf Kenadid of the Majeerteen Darod clan, the nephew of Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid of the Sultanate of Hobyo (Obbia). A phonetically sophisticated alphabet, Kenadid devised the script at the start of the national campaign to settle on a standard orthography for Somali. Borama script The Borama alphabet (Gadabuursi script) was devised around 1933 by Abdurahman Sheikh Nuur of the Gadabuursi clan. Though not as widely known as Osmanya, it produced a notable body of literature mainly consisting of qasidas.I.M. Lewis (1958), The Gadabuursi Somali Script, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 21, pp. 134‚Äì156. A quite accurate phonetic writing system, the Borama script was principally used by Nuur and his circle of associates in his native city of Borama. Kaddare script The Kaddare alphabet was invented in 1952 by Hussein Sheikh Ahmed Kaddare of the Abgaal Hawiye clan. A phonetically robust writing system, the technical commissions that appraised the script concurred that it was a very accurate orthography for transcribing Somali. Several of Kaddare's letters are similar to those in the Osmanya alphabet, while others bear a resemblance to Brahmi.Simon Ager, Kaddare transcription Notes External links *Osmanya, Borama, Wadaad's writing and the Somali language *The report of the Somali Language Committee Category:Somali language Category:Somali orthography Category:1972 establishments in Somalia ","title":"Somali alphabets"},{"id":"24953964","text":"Berna G.

It was a minor hit, peaking at number nine on the Billboard Magazine Country chart. the lyrics are spoken, rather than sung. Content The song tells of a hitchhiker (the singer, in first person) trying to return home from the West Coast. On the third day of his trip, while at a crossroads in a driving rain, the hitchhiker is picked up by \\"Big Joe\\" driving his tractor-trailer named \\"Phantom 309.\\" After driving through the night, Big Joe drops the hitchhiker off at a truck stop, gives him a dime for a cup of coffee, then disappears out of sight. Once inside, the hitchhiker tells of Big Joe's generosity and the waiter tells him he had been the beneficiary of a \\"ghost driver\\" (a variant of the vanishing hitchhiker/truck driver urban legend). Ten years earlier, at the same intersection where he was picked up, Big Joe had swerved to avoid hitting a school bus full of children because he could not stop due to his truck's momentum. But in doing so, he had lost control of his truck and crashed; he had died in the wreck. The waiter tells the hiker that he was not the first; the ghost of Big Joe had been known to pick up other hitchhikers over the years. Tom Waits version The song was covered with slightly reworked lyrics by Tom Waits in July 1975 at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles and released in October on his third album, the pseudo-live double-LP Nighthawks at the Diner, under the title ‚ÄúBig Joe and Phantom 309‚Äù. (To establish mood for the studio audience, Waits refers to the studio as \\"Raphael's Silver Cloud Lounge\\" on the album's first track). This version was covered by Archers of Loaf on 1995's Step Right Up: The Songs of Tom Waits. Other covers Other artists who have recorded \\"Phantom 309\\" include Dave Dudley, Del Reeves, Ferlin Husky, and Boxcar Willie. Johnny Cash's song \\"Like The 309\\", posthumously released in 2006's American V: A Hundred Highways, pays tribute to the original. Stan Ridgway's 1986 UK top 5 hit \\"Camouflage\\", about a ghostly marine, was inspired in part by this song. In 1981, the Dutch song 'Stille Willie' ('Silent William') by the B.B. Band (Bill Bradley Band) tells the same story. 'Stille Willie' on Youtube Cultural allusions In the movie Pee-wee's Big Adventure, protagonist Pee- wee Herman, hitchhiking at night, is given a ride by trucker Large Marge, who proceeds to tell him of a horrible accident that occurred on the night in question years before, scaring him so that he requests to be let off sooner than he planned. Arriving at a truck stop, she advises him to tell the wait staff that Large Marge sent him, and drives away cackling. When he walks in the restaurant and mentions her name, the staff and regulars confirm that Marge perished in that very accident. In the movie \\"Trailer Park Boys: Don't Legalize It\\", \\"Phantom 309\\" is the background music to the intro scene at Ray's funeral. The song also reoccurs (continuing where it left off in the intro) later in the film when Bubbles contemplates leaving Ricky and Julian to live in the school bus his parents left him in their will.

Biography Beck was born in Heidelberg. His merchant father died when Beck was young, and his mother married Wilhelm de Wette, a theologian, biblical scholar, and professor in the University of Heidelberg. In 1810, the family moved to Berlin, where de Wette had been appointed professor of theology at the new Prussian university. In Berlin, while a student at the Werdersches Gymnasium, Beck began to frequent the Hasenheide Turnplatz where he became proficient in the arts of a Turner.This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Beck studied the classics at the University of Berlin, then theology at the University of Heidelberg where he was ordained, and finally at the University of T√ºbingen where he was awarded a Ph.D.. While a student, he became active in the Burschenschaft movement, and on his graduation found his republican sentiments prevented him from pursuing a career in Germany. Thus he became employed for some time as tutor at the University of Basle in Switzerland, where his step father was a professor. After the murder of August von Kotzebue, de Wette had written a letter to the assassin's mother in which he attempted to console her saying her son did the act out of a mistaken sense of duty. On learning of the letter, the Prussian authorities accused him of excusing the assassination, dismissed him from his professorship at Berlin and banished him from Prussia. De Witte lived in retirement a few years, and then in 1822 had become professor of theology at the Basle university. By 1824, Beck felt his republican sentiments endangered his liberty even in Switzerland, and he took refuge in the Paris where he met Charles Follen, another German in a similar situation. The two then left from Le Havre for the United States on 5 November, arriving in New York City on 19 December 1824. Soon afterward Beck became connected, as teacher, with the Round Hill School at Northampton, Massachusetts. There he was appointed teacher of Latin. He also established at Round Hill an outdoor gymnasium: the first gymnasium in the United States, which hosted the first school gymnastics program in that country.Albert Bernhardt Faust, The German Element in the United States (2 vols.), Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1909, vol. II, chap. V, p. 215. He taught physical education classes with a curriculum modeled after Jahn's system, and translated Jahn's 1816 work Deutsche Turnkunst into English as Treatise on Gymnasticks, taken chiefly from the German of F. L. Jahn. In 1830, he and two other teachers established a school at Philipstown, New York, on the Hudson River, opposite West Point. In 1832 Beck was appointed professor of Latin language and literature at Harvard. He became a member of the American Oriental Society in 1843 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1845. On his retirement from Harvard in 1850, he devoted himself to literary pursuits and classical studies. In 1863, he published The Manuscripts of the Satyricon of Petronius Arbiter, described and collated. For two years he represented Cambridge in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He was specially interested in the soldiers' fund, the Sanitary Commission, and the agencies for the care and education of the freedmen. In 1827 he married Louisa A. Henshaw (d. 1830), and in 1831 he married her sister, Teresa H. Phillips (d. 1863). He died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, aged 67.

STANAG 5066 provides peer protocols that operate above an HF modem and below the application level. STANAG 5066 includes the mandatory SIS (Subnet Interface Sublayer, sometimes called Subnet Interface Service) protocol that enables an application to connect to an HF modem through a STANAG 5066 server over TCP/IP. This enables a clean separation between application and modem. The standard also defines two more layers, CAS which is intended to establish connections to other HF nodes and control the status of these connections, and DTS, which controls all the data manipulation for transmission (slicing, directioning, timing...) and the reconstruction in reception. There are two basic modes of transmission defined by this standard. ARQ and NON-ARQ. # ARQ uses package confirmation (through ACK response packages), and sliding window technique, which size is 128 elements. The \\"sending-services\\" can also have delivery confirmation of every package they send. It is necessarily a point-to-point protocol. It can be compared to TCP. # NON-ARQ is a transmission mode in which the receiver node does not confirm the well-reception of the received packages. Receivers try to compose corrupted parts from future receptions, if it is impossible, the STANAG 5066 defines that the package has to be dispatched, and mark it with the known errored parts. This transmission mode allows to use point-to-point, point-to-group and broadcast. It can be compared to UDP in the IP philosophy. STANAG 5066 defines a SIS-to-SIS package size of 2048 bytes maximum, when using point-to-point transmitting mode (ARQ or NON-ARQ), and 4096 bytes when using broadcast (NON-ARQ only).

Arguments The plaintiff's main argument, in this case the Collector, claimed that the Federal Government of the United States is supreme in the area of taxation given to them in the U.S. Constitution. Specifically, they cite this right in the Constitution, \\"Under the general rules of taxation, every man and everything throughout the country (exports excepted) are subject to taxation in the discretion of Congress...\\" They argued that since the Judge works for his own salary from the state, but as a citizen of the United States, Judge Day should pay his taxes to support the Federal government. They believed that just because he worked for the state, he should not be exempted from his duties as an American citizen. Judge J.M. Day, the county probate judge of Massachusetts, argued that the Federal government is stretching their limits by taxing an officer of the State. He claimed that these powers are not expressly given to them in the Constitution, and that the Collector is ultimately violating State power. Supreme Court decision Decided on April 3, 1871, in an 8 to 1 decision, the Supreme Court decided in favor of the Defendant, Judge Day. Justice Samuel Nelson delivered the opinion of the court and cites several court cases from the past, including McCulloch v. Maryland, Dobbins v. The Commission of Erie County, and Weston v. Charleston. Justice Nelson uses these examples to highlights the examples of federalism v. states powers. In his opinion, Nelson makes very clear that the national and state governments are part of one another but remain as \\"separate and distinct sovereignties, acting separately and independently of each other, within their respective spheres\\". He makes his opinion stronger by stating that since it is already in the Constitution that that state may not tax the national government, then it should be the same way that the Federal government may not hinder upon state taxes. Justice Nelson refers to this action as the doctrine of \\"reciprocal immunity.\\" After reading his entire opinion, it is obvious that he and majority of the court based their opinions on anti-federalist point of views, which favor State rights and oppose a centralized controlling government. In the dissenting opinion delivered by Justice Bradley, he claims that he sees no distinct difference between the national government and the state government taxing the officials of the state. He claims that since every citizen living in a state is in fact a part of the United States, the national government has the ability to tax the officials of the states. Justice Bradley does not agree with the defendant's idea that being an official of a particular state makes him exempt from the federal law. He believes that if the court gives the states this right of taxing their own officials, then what would stop them from furthering their powers? He sees the gray line that this decision could bring about. A thorough read of his dissent makes it clear that Justice Bradley bases his opinion from a federalist point of view.

A. Poletti, \\"The performance of a new assisted reverberation system,\\" Acta Acustica, 2 December 1994, pp 511-524] Such systems are increasingly being used to provide variable acoustics for multipurpose venues.[B. Blesser and L-R Salter, ‚ÄúSpaces speak, are you listening? Experiencing aural architecture,‚Äù The MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2007][ M. Barron, Auditorium acoustics and architectural design, E and F.N. Spon, 1993] VRAS uses multiple microphones distributed around the room, fed via a multichannel digital reverberator to multiple loudspeakers to provide controllable enhancement of the reverberation time of the room. It is an example of a non-in-line or regenerative sound system which uses the inherent feedback of sound from the loudspeakers to the microphones to enhance the reverberation time for all sound source positions within the room. VRAS uses a unitary reverberator which maintains a constant power gain with frequency so that its inclusion does not affect the stability of the system (at each frequency the reverberator is a unitary matrix).[ M. A. Poletti, ‚ÄùThe stability of single and multichannel sound systems,‚Äù Acustica- Acta Acustica, vol. 86, pp 123-178, 2000] In addition, VRAS uses a number of microphones close to the stage area to detect early energy from the performers, which is used to generate early reflections. Such systems are termed in-line or non-regenerative. In-line systems aim to minimise the effects of regeneration by detecting stage sound at a high level, and may then be used to generate early reflections or late reverberation. VRAS is thus a hybrid system that uses both regenerative and non-regenerative approaches. VRAS was developed by Mark Poletti at Industrial Research Limited, New Zealand and commercialized by LCS Audio. VRAS is now a part of the Meyer Sound Laboratories Constellation System.

He had two children Bolajoko and Kayode Akintola. He was a musician and band leader who played in the Highlife style, introducing talking drums into the musical style. He moved to Lagos from Ibadan in the late 1950s, and was most popular during the 1960s. In contrast to Victor Olaiya, whose music was based on Ghanaian melodies and progressions, Roy Chicago based his music on Nigerian indigenous themes and folklores. He was one of the highlife musicians who changed his name to a purely Western form, perhaps to make it sound more cool. Career Roy Chicago started playing in the 1950s at Central Hotel on Adamasingba Street in Ibadan before moving to Lagos. In his early years, Roy Chicago was helped by Bobby Benson who guided him in playing the saxophone and leading a band. After Nigeria gained independence in 1960, Roy Chicago became increasingly successful with hits such as \\"Iyawo Pankeke\\", \\"Are owo niesa Yoyo gbe\\" and \\"Keregbe emu\\". In the 1960s, Victor Olaiya's International All Stars and Roy Chicago's Abalabi Rhythm Dandies were two of the leading highlife bands in Nigeria, both led by graduates of the Bobby Benson Orchestra. Roy Chicago became well known at the Abalabi Hotel in Mushin, introducing the talking drum into highlife. With the Nigerian Civil War of 1967‚Äì1970, highlife became less popular at the expense of Yoruba-derived J√πj√∫ music, since the Igbo people from the breakaway regions of eastern Nigeria had run many of the top highlife bands. The result was an increase in popularity of the easy-going and less rigid juju form of music at the expense of highlife. At a low point in Chicago's career in the 1970s, Bobby Benson helped again by providing musical equipment and giving him a place to stay in Surulere. Music Roy Chicago combined the trumpet and saxophone with vocals. Playing with Bobby Benson in the 1950s, he performed ball room dance and highlife, fox trot, tango, waltz, quick step, jive and Latin American music. His sidemen included tenor sax player Etim Udo and trumpeter Marco Bazz. Roy Chicago's highlife style had its accent anchored on rhythm. He explained Nigerian folksongs with vocals by Tunde Osofisan, one of the finest singers on the highlife scene. Although his style could not be called a jazz derivative, there are blue notes in his saxophone parts and \\"cool\\" jazz intonations and phrases, which are closer to traditional Yoruba music than to highlife. Legacy Former members of his band included trumpeter/vocalist Cardinal Rex Jim Lawson, who was of mixed Igbo and Kalabari background. Lawson apprenticed with Bobby Benson, Victor Olaiya, and Roy Chicago before striking out on his own with a unique blend of Igbo lyrics sung over Kalabari rhythms. Jimi Solanke, the playwright, poet and folk singer, was another singer with his band. The band's recording of his composition \\"Onile- Gogoro\\" became one of the most memorable highlife hits of the 1960s. Alaba Pedro, a guitarist from Roy Chicago's band, went on to play with Orlando Julius Aremu Olusanya Ekemode, O.J. to his friends.

Dorsey was the first African- American to serve as sheriff of DeKalb County, and was married to Atlanta city councilwoman Sherry Dorsey (1954‚Äì2006). When he was defeated in a 2000 runoff by challenger Derwin Brown, he arranged the murder of Brown. Derwin Brown murder case On July 10, 2002, Dorsey was convicted of ordering Brown's assassination in order to obstruct Brown's expected probe into corruption occurring in the DeKalb County sheriff's office during Dorsey's term. Superior Court Judge Cynthia Becker sentenced Dorsey to life on the murder conviction, an additional 23 years on racketeering and violation of oath of office convictions, and concurrent sentences ranging from 10 to 15 years on his several convictions of theft by taking of the oath of office of an elected official. Dorsey is currently held in Georgia State Prison and shares a cell with Sam Swaegro. In 2007, it was reported that Dorsey allegedly confessed to his part in ordering the hit on Brown, out of bitterness for his defeat in the local county sheriff's election. However, he claimed that he had attempted to abort the assassination plot before Brown's murder, but was unsuccessful. Atlanta Child Murders Task Force Before his tenure as sheriff, Dorsey served on the task force that looked into reopening the case of convicted murderer Wayne Williams. Dorsey appeared as one of many, including some of the victims' relatives, who voiced public doubt of Williams's guilt of the murders. Dorsey is quoted as stating: \\"Most people who are aware of the child murders believe as I do that Wayne Williams did not commit these crimes\\". Williams was identified as the key suspect in the Atlanta Child Murders that occurred between 1979 and 1981. In January 1982, he was found guilty of the murder of two adult men. Dorsey, as an Atlanta homicide detective, supervised the first search of Williams' home in 1981.Killers Guilt still is disputed: 17 years later debate continues, Seattle Times, 6/21/1999 References Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:African-American police officers Category:American police officers Category:Georgia (U.S. state) sheriffs Category:American police officers convicted of murder Category:American prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:People convicted of murder by Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Georgia (U.S. state) Category:People from Atlanta Category:American assassins Category:African-American sheriffs ","title":"Sidney Dorsey"},{"id":"24954711","text":"Captain Herbert James Hamilton (30 April 1895 ‚Äì 13 June 1918) was a World War I flying ace credited with seven aerial victories.

Gameplay The game comes with a set of earphones, allowing the player to hear communications from HQ and other units in the battle zone directly to the ears. Game options are point-and-click on a graphic representation of a piece of tank hardware and that is the command to activate. A map overlay allows you the player navigate toward a sector. On the communication screen, the player sets the frequency to listen and respond to commands, weather reports, and other items. Reception M4 was reviewed in 1993 in Dragon #193 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. Markus Dahlberg reviewed M4 for Swedish magazine Datormagazin in 1994. Dahlberg felt that the game did recreate the feel of sitting inside a tank to some extent, and that the headphones actually give an authentic feel and the sound was very good. He felt that the graphics were obsolete, and noted that the radio communication was the only thing in the game that was really good.

The ants patrol the plant, removing leaf-eaters, while their excreta is absorbed by the plant for nutrition.Skull, S., Plants of the Melaleuca Woodlands, 1995, James Cook University The flowers are white and tubular, to 10 mm, and the fruit is white/translucent containing a single seed.

Hypochrysops is a genus of \\"blues\\", butterflies in the family Lycaenidae, which is notorious for its myrmecophily. Accordingly, it is likely that the larvae that hatch from the eggs feed either on food begged from the ants, or on ant larvae, or possibly both.

In 1970, he married his second wife, Rene Wagoner. He had two sons, W. Richard West Jr. and James Lee West. Teaching career In 1941, West began his first teaching assignment at the Phoenix Indian School but then joined the US Navy to fight in Europe in World War II from 1942 to 1946. Upon his honorable discharge, West returned to teaching at the Phoenix Indian School, then chaired the art department at Bacone College from 1947 to 1970. From 1970 to 1977, West taught art at Haskell Indian Junior College. From his teaching, he influenced innumerable Native artists. His students included such successful artists as Joan Hill, Enoch Kelly Haney, Johnny Tiger Jr., Sharron Ahtone Harjo, Marlene Riding In-Mameah, and Virginia Stroud. From 1979 to 1980, West served as professor emeritus at Bacone College. Artwork Dick West was a master of flat-style painting, that drew upon the pictorial and narrative aspects of Plains hide painting. Flat style painting frequently portrays tribal dances and histories. His works portrayed Cheyenne culture, as informed by his highly traditional upbringing. A complete departure from that style was West's Indian Christ series, which were lush, allegorical oil paintings of New Testament stories with Native American figures, set in the Southern Plains. Through this series, West wanted to portray the universality of Jesus. Although flat-style is what he is best known for, West also painted abstract and highly stylized works in oil, watercolor, tempera, and gouache. He illustrated four books and also sculpted in wood and metal. Awards and honors The Section of Painting and Sculpture commissioned West to paint a mural for the U.S. Post Office of Okemah, Oklahoma in 1941. He won two grand awards from the Philbrook Museum. In 1964, he won the Waite Phillips Outstanding Indian Artist Award from the Philbrook Museum of Art. In 1962, the Eastern Baptist College awarded him an honorary doctorates in humane letters, as did the Baker University, in 1976. From 1979-80, West was a commissioner on the Indian Arts and Crafts Board.

Quote [T]he Indian artist must be allowed freedom to absorb influences outside of his own art forms and see the promise of a new lane of expression that should keep the Indian's art the art form termed 'native Indian painting,' and I give my student every opportunity to execute it... I have always felt that the term abstraction has been a part of the Indian's artistic thinking longer than most European contemporary influences and perhaps in a [truer] form...\\" ‚ÄîDick West, 1955Wyckoff, 287 Notes References *Lester, Patrick D.

Evans' paintings are characterized by a highly realistic representation of landscape, architecture, and the human figure.  Early life  Evans was born in 1954 in Bremerton, Washington, to Virginia Joan (n√©e Bartholomew) and Alan Edward Evans. As a child, Evans was encouraged by his parents to express himself through drawing and painting. In high school, he joined the staff of the school newspaper, drawing cartoons and caricatures, writing and illustrating articles and taking photographs. Inspired by a teacher, Evans began to focus his academic career on art, traveling to Europe upon graduation and viewing classical art in museums in Belgium, France, Spain, Italy, Germany and England. While his family members supported his artistic endeavors as a youngster, when Evans applied to college he was encouraged to seek an education preparing him for a \\"real job\\". He began classes at UCLA as an art history major, but continued to paint in his free time. Upon showing his work to his art history professors, Evans was encouraged by them to change his major area of study, graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1977 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting, sculpture and graphic arts. He continued his studies and received a Master of Fine Arts from the same university in 1980.  Film career  Shortly after college, Evans watched the film The Empire Strikes Back. Impressed by the film's portrayal of the Cloud City, he submitted samples of his work to George Lucas' company, Industrial Light & Magic, and was offered a position as a matte painter. Evans subsequently became the head of the matte painting department at ILM, where he continued to work until 1989, contributing to such films as Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, The Dark Crystal and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. While at ILM, Evans was nominated for an Academy Award for his work on Willow, and was awarded an Emmy for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for his work on The Ewok Adventure. After leaving ILM, Evans joined Matte World Digital, where he worked as a digital matte painter and art director, contributing to films including Titanic,Diaz, Jesus. \\"How the original Star Wars trilogy fooled everyone with matte paintings,\\" Sploid, January 19, 2015.

Despite the name, the dish only barely resembles Japanese sukiyaki, having more in common with shabu shabu and Chinese hot pot. Thai sukiyaki evolved from Chinese hot pot served in restaurants catering to members of Thailand's sizeable ethnic Chinese clientele, in which an aluminum pot was heated on a charcoal fire at the table and the raw ingredients presented on one big plate. In 1957, a restaurant called Coca opened its first branch in Soi Tantawan, Bangkok, offering a modified version of the Chinese hot pot under the Japanese name of Sukiyaki. Although it only vaguely resembled Japanese sukiyaki, it was a catchy name for it because of a Japanese pop song called \\"Sukiyaki\\" which was a big worldwide hit at the time. This modified Thai version proved to be a massive hit, and it wasn't long before other chains started opening \\"suki\\" restaurants across Bangkok and other cities, each with its own special dipping sauce as the selling point. In Thai sukiyaki, diners have more options of ingredients to choose from, each portion being considerably smaller in order to enable diners to order many more varieties. The spicy dipping sauce (nam chim suki) caters to Thai tastes, too, with much chili sauce, chili, lime and coriander leaves added. The raw ingredients are presented on small plates and are cooked at the table in a gas- or electrically heated stainless steel pot containing broth. Usually, an egg is added to the broth at the start of the meal. Today the MK Restaurant chain, which opened its first restaurant in 1962 on Siam Square in Bangkok, is the most popular in Thailand with around 200 restaurants across the country and 23 in Japan. Coca is making a rapid spread abroad, too, already serving Thai suki in 24 outlets across Asia and Australia and further outlets planned in the US and Europe.

It is a major source of natural gas in the northern part of the basin. The Antrim Shale was defined by A. C. Lane in 1901, and named for type-section exposures in Antrim County, Michigan. The formation was previously known as the St. Cleric Shale in Michigan, and the Genesee Shale in Indiana.Indiana Geological Survey, Antrim Shale, accessed 4 November 2009. Stratigraphy Stratigraphic relationships of the Antrim Shale, from Ryder (1996) US Geological Survey. The Antrim is a brown to black, pyritic, highly laminated and organic-rich shale, from 60 to 220 feet thick. Total organic content varies from 1% to 20%. In some places the unit includes a gray calcareous shale or limestone, and in places a fine-grained sandstone at the base. The formation is called the Kettle Point Formation in Ontario, and is the stratigraphic equivalent of the New Albany Shale in the Illinois Basin. It is overlain by the Bedford Shale, and underlain in some areas by the Jordan River Formation, and elsewhere by the Thunder Bay Limestone. Natural gas The Antrim Shale, is a major source of shale gas, and produces natural gas along a swath across the northern part of the state.Michigan DEQ map: Antrim, PDF file, downloaded 12 February 2009. Most natural gas production is in Antrim, Crawford, Montmorency, Oscoda and Otsego counties.Michigan State University, Oil and Gas, accessed 3 November 2009. Although the Antrim Shale has produced gas since the 1940s, the play was not active until the late 1980s. During the 1990s, the Antrim became the most actively drilled shale gas play in the US, with thousands of wells drilled. To date, the shale has produced more than 2.5 TCF from more than 9 thousand wells. Antrim Shale wells produced almost in 2006. The shale appears to be most economic at depths of 600-2,200 feet. Original gas content ranges from 40 to 100 standard cubic feet per ton. Wells are developed on units of from to .US Department of Energy, Modern Shale gas Development in the United States, April 2009, p.17. Horizontal drilling is not widely used. Antrim Shale wells often have to pump much initial water before gas production becomes significant, a behavior also seen in many coalbed methane wells. Unlike most other shale gas plays, the natural gas from the Antrim appears to be biogenic gas generated by the action of bacteria on the organic-rich rock.Sally Pobojewski, \\"Antrim shale could hold bacterial answer to natural gas supply,\\" The University Record (University of Michigan), 17 September 1996, accessed 3 November 2009. Also unlike most other shale plays, the Antrim Shale is thermally immature in the gas-productive trend.Jeff Salacup, Anaerobic biodegradation of organic matter in the Devonian Antrim Shale, PDF file, retrieved 4 November 2009.

Early scholars Early references to e-Science and librarianship involve information studies scholars researching cyberinfrastructure and emerging networked information and knowledge communities. Notably Christine Borgman, Professor and Presidential Chair in Information Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) was a key player in bringing e-Science, and the idea of networked knowledge communities, to the attention of the library profession. In 2004, as a Visiting Fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute, she conducted research and lectured publicly on e-Science, Digital Libraries, and Knowledge Communities.Christine L.

The ARL's report encouraged its member libraries to position themselves to engage with researchers involved in e-Science (eScience) by cultivating new research support strategies and developing their digital scholarship infrastructure. E-Science has multiple attributes; Tony and Jessie Hey framed e-Science for the library community by characterizing it as a research methodology: \\"e-Science is not a new scientific discipline in its own right: e-Science is shorthand for the set of tools and technologies required to support collaborative, networked science\\". In addition to academic libraries' interests in providing support for their researchers engaging in e-Science, the health sciences library community also emerged as a major proponent for creating librarian positions for supporting the information needs of large- scale, networked, research collaborations on their campuses. Neil Rambo, current director of NYU's Health Sciences Library and former director of University of Washington Health Sciences Library, was the first to use the term in the Journal of the Medical Library Association, in his 2009 editorial e-Science and the Biomedical Library. Rambo's definition of e-Science highlighted the potential e-Science held for creating data as a research product: \\"E-science is a new research methodology, fueled by networked capabilities and the practical possibility of gathering and storing vast amounts of data.\\"Rambo, N. E-science and biomedical libraries. J Med Libr Assoc. 2009 July; 97(3): 159‚Äì161.

A Subject Librarian's Guide to Collaborating on E-Science Projects Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship, n57 Spr 2009. * Library and information science expertise * Subject expertise * Partnerships and outreach (both internal and external) * Participating in sponsored research * Balancing workload An example of librarians reconfiguring traditional librarian skills to meet the needs of researchers engaging in e-Science is Witt & Carlson's adaptation of the traditional reference interview into a \\"data interview\\" in order to provide effective data management and e-Science services. This interview consists of ten practical queries necessary for understanding the provenance and expectations for the preservation of datasets typical of e-Science that also help illustrate some of the educational tools and skills needed by a librarian new to e-Science. \\"What is the story of the data? What form and format are the data in? What is the expected lifespan of the dataset? How could the data be used, reused, and repurposed? How large is the dataset, and what is its rate of growth?

Lichtenstein was the first man shot on the inner German border after the establishment of the Berlin Wall in August 1961. The circumstances were revisited in a criminal trial in 1997. The two defendants were acquitted of manslaughter. Personal life Kurt Lichtenstein was the son of Jewish merchant and shoemaker Georg Lichtenstein and Henriette Lichtenstein (n√©e Haase). He grew up in Berlin in the Prenzlauer Berg district, where he attended primary and higher secondary school. He left high school to work as an errand boy at a clothing store, later training as a tool maker. Unemployed in 1932-1933, Lichtenstein emigrated for political reasons. His parents divorced in 1924, and were deported with his sister to Auschwitz concentration camp in 1941, where they are presumed to have died. In 1946, Lichtenstein married Gertrud Klapputh, an affiliate of the German Communist Party. They had two daughters, born in 1946 and 1948 and a son, born in 1947, with an daughter from Stanislaw Trabalski.S√§chsisches Staatsarchiv Leipzig; Kaderakte der SED lfdn: 725, Bericht der SED √ºber Stanislaw Trabalski, Seite 2 Lichtenstein spent the most part of his later life as a journalist for political newspapers. Political life At the age of 17, Liechtenstein joined the Communist Youth League (KJVD) in 1928, and by 1931 was a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). In 1933, he emigrated to the Soviet Union due to racial and political persecution. After political training, Lichtenstein worked for the KJVD in the then politically autonomous Saarland. At this time he personally knew Erich Honecker. After the Saarland was annexed by Germany in 1935, he went to Paris where he was active in the communist movement, using the pseudonyms \\"Herbert\\", \\"Lauterbur\\", \\"Gaston Bergeaud\\" and \\"Jules Bardier\\". Spanish Civil War and World War II At the end of 1936 Lichtenstein went to Spain as an International Brigade volunteer, serving the Republic in the Spanish Civil War. Until 1937 he served in the Thalmann Battalion as a Political Commissar. At times he was involved as a journalist in the work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Spain. In this capacity he acted as the editor of the German edition of the International Brigade newspaper, Volontaire de la Libert√©. He also worked for a Republican radio station. During the Battle of Ebro in 1938, as a member of a machine gun unit, he was wounded. In the final phase of the war he was demoted for cowardice before the enemy for his involvement in a withdrawal. After the Spanish Civil War, Lichtenstein fled to France. Due to the Second World War, the French state interned Lichtenstein in southern France in 1939 as an enemy alien. Fearing that the Vichy government would hand control of the camps to the Gestapo, Lichtenstein fled. On Communist Party instructions he joined the French Resistance in Toulouse. Also on Communist Party orders, Lichtenstein became a foreign worker in France, working using a false identity in a defense industry in Thuringia. In 1945 he was handed over to French forces and interned as a suspected nazi. The French Communist Party intervened to free him, and he returned to Germany. Post-War After the Second World War Lichtenstein worked in the Ruhr for the Communist Party. He was a journalist for several communist-oriented newspapers. He also edited the Neuen Volkszeitung (New People's Daily). Between 1947 and 1950 he was a Communist Party member of the state parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia. During inner- party purges in 1950, he was associated with the disgrace and fall of Kurt M√ºller. In 1953 Lichtenstein was expelled for anti-party activities and dismissed as chief editor of the Neuen Volkszeitung. For several years he worked odd jobs. He joined the German Socialist Party (SPD). In 1958 he received a journalistic appointment to the SPD-oriented Westf√§lische Rundschau which appeared in Dortmund. Death In October 1961 Lichtenstein was reporting on the inner German border. He wanted to travel the entire inner German border to report on the situation two months after the construction of the Berlin Wall. Lichtenstein began his trip in L√ºbeck in an ostentatious red car, and by 12 October 1961 was in Wolfsburg in Lower Saxony. Around noon he reported to a border post in Brome-Zicherie. He followed county road 85, along the border, towards the Parsau Kaiser angle. At 6.5 kilometers, he talked with members of a LPG Brigade on German Democratic Republic (East German) territory. He crossed the shallow border ditch and the 10 meter wide border control strip. Two border guards hailed him. As Lichtenstein was running in the direction of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), the border guards shot him with submachine guns. Lichtenstein's body was in the border ditch, with one fifth of his body located on the Western side of the border. East German border guards transported him to a hospital, where he died. His body was cremated, and the ashes returned to his widow by post. In October 1961 a funeral service took place in Dortmund. The German Federal Republic's minister for All German Affairs, Ernst Lemmer, and the SPD member Herbert Wehner, were amongst the mourners. Aftermath The Lichtenstein border incident occurred during a period of high Cold War tension. The death was used politically by Western and Eastern powers. In the West, press and government reacted with outrage and disgust, and Lichtenstein was converted into a martyr. For the East this appeared to be a provoking border incident. The Socialist Unity Party (SED) central newspaper Neues Deutschland (New Germany) carried the headline, \\"Provocateur violates the state border of the GDR.\\" Despite eyewitness accounts of the incident from both East and West Germans, rumors abounded that Lichtenstein had been killed for other reasons. Alternate theories of Lichtenstein's death have focused on his earlier political work with and his departure from the German Communist Party. In late 1961, a memorial was erected to Lichtenstein near the place of his death. The memorial consisted of a cross and an explanatory sign that read \\"Ein Deutscher, von Deutschen erschossen Kurt Lichtenstein ‚Ä† 12.10.1961\\" (A German, shot dead by Germans, Kurt Lichtenstein 12.10.1961) The memorial became a place of political demonstration. Other signs were erected on the site, with messages that framed the shooting as a deliberate murder. In 1962, the memorial was the site of a large demonstration. The incident was revisited in the 1990s, and the border guard who had shot Lichtenstein stood trial for homicide. In 1997, the shooter was acquitted on the grounds that he was following orders and had no intent to kill.

Description This runic inscription consists of runic text carved on a serpent that circles a center where the serpent's head and tail are intertwined. A small Christian cross is in the upper part of the design. The runestone is 1.01 meters in height and made of gneiss. The inscription for stylistic reasons has been attributed to the runemaster √ñpir, who was active in the Uppland area in the late 11th or early 12th century. It has its runic inscription around an intricate animal design and is carved in runestone style Pr5, also known as the Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. The runic text states that a man named either Holmgeirr or Hjalmgeirr raised the stone as a memorial to his two sons, √çgulfastr and Svarth«´f√∞i.

This steamboat is chiefly remembered for its destruction by a boiler explosion in which by good fortune no one was seriously hurt. A folklore tale later arose about this disaster. Construction and owners  Elk was built in 1857 at Canemah, Oregon by Capt. Christopher (or Christian) E. Sweitzer 1829-1860). , Fran√ßois X. Matthieu, George A. Pease (1830-1919), and John Marshall Jacob Kamm also held a share of the vessel. Advertisement for the new steamer Elk, placed October 16, 1858 Construction Elk was built for the Phoenix Company at Canemah, Oregon. Elk was launched on Tuesday, September 8, 1857. The steamer was expected to be complete in two or three weeks after launch. Elk was built for the Butteville, Champoeg, and Yamhill River trade. The hull was built by two men, Lambert and McCourt. The cabin was built by Christopher E. Sweitzer, who was also a part owner. Sweizter was an experienced steamboat man on the upper Willamette River who was expected to become the captain and pilot of the Elk. Dimensions and engineering Elk was long, with a beam (width) of . Elk was expected to be 60 tons burthen. Elk was expected to be able to carry 50 or 60 tons of cargo. Elk was driven by twin steam engines, horizontally mounted. Each engine had a cylinder bore of and a piston stroke of . The sternwheel was in diameter. The machinery was built by John Marshall or one Moore who were also part owners. Either Moore or Marshall was expected to become the engineer of the steamer when it was launched. Marshall did serve as engineer on Elk. Operations Advertisement for steamers of the Upper Willamette Transportation Line, placed January 21, 1860. Elk made its trial trip from Canemah to Champoeg, Oregon on Thursday, October 8, 1857, covering the distance in 131 minutes. This was only five minutes less than the best time for the Enterprise, a sternwheeler built in 1855. Elk was received enthusiastically at Butteville, Oregon and Champoeg, with the local populace cheering and firing off cannons as the steamer reached each landing. Leonard White, an early steamboat man who had a devotion to phonetic spelling, was apparently on board, as he wrote, under the pen name \\"Fonos\\" or \\"Fono\\", a description for The Oregon Argus, which began: As of October 24, 1857 Elk was making trips from Canemah to Champoeg, Oregon. Elk would be under the command of Captain Sweitzer. The owners planned to put Elk in the trade on the Yamhill River once the water rose. As of November 1, 1859, businessman Theodore Wygant (1831-1905) was the Elk 's agent in Portland, Oregon. Wygant was also agent at the same time for the steamers Onward, Surprise, and Relief. Wygant formed these steamers into the Upper Willamette Transportation Line, and starting November 19, 1859, advertised, stage of water permitting, steamers of the line would depart for Corvallis twice a week, and, for Eugene City, once a week. This arrangement was advertised until June 30, 1860. In 1860, Elk was competing against two powerful companies on the Willamette River, the Oregon Steam Navigation Company and the People's Transportation Company. Boiler explosion George Jerome, captain of the Elk at the time of the explosion. On Saturday afternoon, November 17, 1860, Elk was destroyed by a boiler explosion. Reports that this occurred in 1857 or in 1861 are erroneous. The explosion occurred near Davidson's Landing, about one mile (1.6 km) below the mouth of the Yamhill River. Officers on board Elk at the time were George Jerome (1823‚Äì1886), captain, William Smith, engineer, Sebastian \\"Bas\\" Miller, pilot, and John Murray, steward. The entire upper works of the vessel disintegrated. Although there were some injuries, no one was killed. Elk had been proceeding downriver, and had rounded in to Davidson‚Äôs to land a package, and was about to pull back into the stream, when the boiler exploded. Captain George Jerome, who had been on the wharf, from which he \\"blown some fifty feet into the air, enjoying a good view of the surrounding country through the tree-tops, and of the falling smokestack beneath him.\\" Jerome landed, with only minor injuries, but \\"found things considerably smashed up on his return.\\" The steward, John Murray, was blown out into the river, but was rescued by a small boat. The most serious injury was to the fireman, whose left arm was badly hurt. There were only four passengers on board, all of whom were gathered around the stove in the after section of the cabin at the time of the explosion. Although they were blown off the boat with the cabin structure, they escaped unharmed. No one was seriously hurt, but those who were injured were treated at the Davidson‚Äôs home, by Mrs. Davidson. The cargo, consisting principally of apples, was mostly lost. Total loss to the steamer‚Äôs owners was about $8,000. Folklore Folklore records a story as a result of the explosion, Captain Jerome had been blown so high into the air, that he could look down the ship's chimney, also flying through the air, and see pilot Bas Miller lying dazed on the river bank where the explosion had left him. Jerome was said to have landed in a cottonwood tree. It was said that for twenty years afterwards pilots and crew on steamboats on the river pointed out this particular tree to passengers, but Captain Jerome never did so, in the interest of maintaining his dignity.

A high-tensile chain, also referred to as a transport chain, is a link chain with a high tensile strength used for drawing or securing loads. This type of chain usually consist of broad (thick/heavy) metal, oblong torus-shaped links for high strength. All the links of the chain are usually identical, and on the ends are usually two hooks of the appropriate size and strength to slide easily over one chain link but small enough not let the links slip by. When the ability to grasp the load is required, a slip hook is used. The chain used for tire chains on tractors and some automobiles for better traction is very similar; usually consisting of the same type of link, especially so for snow chains; however, instead of being a single chain, it is more of a network of interconnected chains with no hooked ends; the size and design of the network depending on the tire it was intended for. When chains are used to restrain loads on a vehicle a load binder is used to tighten the chain. Standards development organizations such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers provide Standards for the additional information on these chains.

Early life Lees-Spalding, always known as Tim, was born in Ealing, London, on 16 June 1920, and educated at Blundell's School in Tiverton and the Royal Naval Engineering College. Naval career Lees- Spalding had joined the Royal Navy in 1938 and in 1941, while still under training, was awarded a King's Commendation for Brave Conduct for digging out with his bare hands a woman trapped beneath a pile of rubble after a German night air raid on Plymouth. A year later, he was awarded a Royal Lifesaving Institution Medal for rescuing a drowning man from the sea off Teignmouth. In 1943 Lees-Spalding went to sea in the anti-aircraft cruiser , which saw action in the Mediterranean, and he was present at Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily in July. Following the Italian Armistice in September 1943, the 12th Cruiser Squadron, of which Sirius was part, landed troops of the British 1st Airborne Division at Taranto. The ship suffered bomb damage off the Greek island of Leros in October and Lees-Spalding was still serving when Sirius took part in the Normandy Landings in June 1944 before returning to the Mediterranean for the invasion of southern France in August. In January 1945, Sirius helped to host the Anglo-American talks prior to the Yalta Conference, providing accommodation for the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and the US Secretary of State Edward Stettinius. Lees-Spalding later served in submarines, before being promoted to commander in 1952; this was followed by service in (a sister-ship to Sirius) and the new destroyer .

Academic career  Gary Saul Morson was born in New York City and attended the Bronx High School of Science. After the high school, Gary Morson was accepted to Yale University. Initially, Morson was interested in physics. However, he ended up graduating with a degree in Russian. ‚ÄúWhat I liked about physics is that it asked the ultimate questions. I loved how when you look at the world, all this amazing complexity had these very simple rules behind it. Now I believe the opposite ‚Äî the argument of my favorite writer, Tolstoy, is that the world doesn‚Äôt fit any system, because human psychology is so infinitely complex,‚Äù Morson says. Morson spent a year at Oxford on a Henry Fellowship. At Oxford, he became friends with Bill Clinton. ‚ÄúA great deal of my pitiful income from those years went to Clinton‚Äôs campaign for attorney general of Arkansas,‚Äù Morson says.

It has been accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) since 2008, and is a member of the American Alliance of Museums (AAM). History The Greensboro Science Center (GSC) was established in 1957 as the Greensboro Junior Museum. By its 40th anniversary in 1997, it was attracting some 200,000 visitors each year, and attendance has continued to grow to 434,718 as of 2017. The current executive director, Glenn Dobrogosz,Retrieved 12-31-10 News-record.com was hired in 2004 The facility received accreditation by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums in 2008. As part of a $20 million makeover, the GSC opened Time Warner Cable's Extreme Weather Gallery in May 2011, and the HealthQuest exhibit in June 2011. On May 2, 2015, the Greensboro Science Center opened its tree top adventure park, Skywild. Attractions Rhinoceros iguana at the Greensboro Science Center The Animal Discovery Zoological Park is home to animals including red pandas, tigers, white-nosed coati, meerkats, black howler monkeys, and Nile crocodiles, and is designed to showcase the \\"Science of Survival.\\" Attractions within the zoo include the Friendly Farm, Kavanagh Discovery House and Davis Kelly Fountain of Youth and Discovery. The Museum includes Prehistoric Passages: Realm of Dragons, SciPlay Bay, Time Warner Cable's Extreme Weather Gallery, and touch labs that include live snakes, lizards, and invertebrates. The OmniSphere Theater is a full dome theater where visitors experience everything from the stars to coral reefs in 2D and 3D. The Wiseman Aquarium is an aquarium that features animals including stingrays, African penguins, otters, fishing cats, sharks, mata matas, and moon jellies.

The ride is an additional charge, but is built for all ages and abilities. Winter Wonderlights is Greensboro newest holiday attraction, that features a walkable holiday themed light display. Opening in the winter 2020. Plans for the future In 2009, Greensboro voters considered a $20 million bond referendum for the Natural Science Center. $10 million was used for the SciQuarium, a aquarium with more than 75 species of animals and a stingray touch tank. $10 million is planned for renovations and expansions of existing parts of the GSC. The master plan for this renovation was developed with the help of Cambridge Seven Associates and Moser-Mayer Phoenix & Associates, and phase 1 (the SciQuarium) opened in the summer of 2013. Phase 2 will include updates to the current museum, and phase 3 will include new animals such as Pygmy hippos, Cassowary and Red Pandas in an exhibit called \\"Endangered Species Village.\\" Notes External links * Category:Zoos in North Carolina Category:Science museums in North Carolina Category:Museums in Greensboro, North Carolina Category:Natural history museums in North Carolina Category:Aquaria in North Carolina Category:Zoos established in 1957 Category:Paleontology in North Carolina ","title":"Greensboro Science Center"},{"id":"24955532","text":"\\"Thursdays with Abie\\" is the ninth episode of The Simpsons' twenty-first season. In the episode, Grampa meets a human interest journalist who writes and publishes Grampa's life stories making Homer jealous and while giving his story of Mr. Burns to the newspaper finds out the journalist plots to kill Grandpa. Meanwhile, Bart is forced to care for a stuffed lamb as part of a class project and gives the lamb to Lisa. The episode was written by Mitchell H. Glazer & Don Payne and directed by Michael Polcino. Mitch Albom guest stars in the episode. During its original broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on January 3, 2010, \\"Thursdays with Abie\\" was watched by about 8.65 million people and received a . The episode also received positive reviews from critics. Plot During a trip to a water park with the family, Abe meets a journalist named Marshall Goldman. Abe is thrilled that Marshall is interested in hearing his rambling anecdotes, and tells of the time he sat on and Animal trained a real shark during World War II, after the warship he served on was sunk by a torpedo (which they themselves fired earlier) in the Pacific Ocean. Marshall publishes Abe's story in the Springfield Shopper. When Homer reads Marshall's article, he is shocked that other people find Abe's stories interesting. In his next anecdote, Abe tells of giving a not-yet- famous Clark Gable a shoe shine at the Springfield railway station and lending him a copy of Gone with the Wind, but still remembers his anger at not being paid. A rapt Marshall writes up this story as well and Abe's fame grows. Homer decides to visit his father, but Abe tells him off, suggesting that Homer only wants to spend time with him now that he is famous. Later, Marge suggests that, in actuality, Homer is angry with himself for not having spent more time with his dad. Insulted at the not-so-false suggestion, Homer listens to Mr. Burns' anecdotes, writes his own column and takes it to the Springfield Shopper (where it is quickly shredded). While at the newspaper office, Homer sneaks into Marshall's office and discovers a manuscript that Marshall intends to submit for a Pulitzer Prize. The manuscript states that Abe is dead and Homer realizes that Marshall intends to kill Abe. He rushes to the railway station, but Abe and Marshall have already departed on a vintage train known as the Tinseltown Starliner (Clark Gable went to the same train after Abe does his shoe polishing). After knocking out Abe, Marshall attempts to suffocate him with a pillow. With the help of Lenny and Carl, Homer breaks through a window just as Marshall pulls out a gun. The two struggle, and then Abe pulls the emergency brake and Marshall is knocked out by a vast load of hat boxes. Homer and his father reconcile, with Abe telling Homer that he is ready for his first ramble. Meanwhile, Bart has possession of Larry the Lamb, a stuffed sheep toy that each child in Mrs. Krabappel's room takes a turn caring for over a weekend, much to the dismay of Nelson, who says that Larry was \\"all that kept me sane\\" in song. Bart resents the stuffed toy, so Lisa offers to take care of him. However, she accidentally loses Larry down a storm drain. Bart goes in to retrieve him, and is chased by sewer rats and sewer cats before finding Larry atop a pipe. Bart uses Larry to slide to safety but the toy rips and Bart unceremoniously crashes through a grate to a beach, where Agnes Skinner (who all this time has heard the children calling out for \\"Larry\\") tells Bart to \\"Give him my number. I'll teach him things. Things he can use.\\" Production The episode was written by Mitchell H. Glazer & Don Payne and directed by Michael Polcino. Mitch Albom who wrote Tuesdays with Morrie makes a guest appearance. Cultural references \\"Thursdays with Abie\\" serves as a parody of Tuesdays with Morrie in which Mitch Albom learns about life values from his former teacher Morrie Schwartz. Simpsons voice actor Hank Azaria, who voices Marshall, also played Albom in the film based on Tuesdays with Morrie. The opening Flyby gag is a parody of the Wicked Witch of the West from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The Slimu octopus is a parody of Shamu, the killer whale. The song that plays during the train station scenes is the American jazz standard \\"Chattanooga Choo Choo\\". Also Nelson sings a different version of \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Thursdays with Abie\\" was viewed by an estimated 8.65 million households and received a rating of 4.0 rating/10 share in the 18/49 rating being the most viewed and highest rated episode on Fox's Animation Domination. The show ranked seventh in the 18/49 rating and was third on Fox for the week after The OT and The Allstate Sugar Bowl and made it 20th in the weekly ratings (it was still Fox's top rated scripted show). The episode got a positive review from IGN's Robert Canning giving it an 8.4/10 and saying that \\"Overall, the episode was a success, using one of the best Simpsons running jokes to tell an engaging and even sentimental tale\\". Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave episode a C+ saying that \\"Most of the core relationships on The Simpsons have hung on to their ability to move us. Most Homer and Lisa episodes are still touching on some level, while most Bart and Lisa episodes play off the two's easy camaraderie. One of the exceptions to this rule is the relationship between Homer and his dad. The two had some great episodes in the show's early going, as the series examined the way that Abe's inability to be a good single parent reverberated down through the years (in a much, much funnier way than that sounds).\\" Jason Hughes of TV Squad stated in his review \\"I didn't find the episode particularly funny, but I appreciated that The Simpsons did bring a bit of that emotion back to the character's relations\\". Dan Castellaneta was nominated for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for playing Abraham Simpson and Homer Simpson in this episode, but lost to Anne Hathaway who won for her role in another The Simpsons episode Once Upon a Time in Springfield.

Prior to the wide adoption of Unicode, a number of special-purpose EBCDIC and non-EBCDIC code pages were used to represent the symbols required for writing APL. Character sets Due to its origins on IBM Selectric-based teleprinters, APL symbols have traditionally been represented on the wire using a unique, non-standard character set. In the 1960s and 1970s, few terminal devices existed which could reproduce them, the most popular ones being the IBM 2741 and IBM 1050 fitted with a specific APL print head. Over time, with the universal use of high-quality graphic display, printing devices and Unicode support, the APL character font problem has largely been eliminated. EBCDIC code pages Code page 293 (\\"APL (USA)\\") includes APL symbols, in addition to preserving the basic Latin letters and Western Arabic numerals at their usual EBCDIC locations. Code page 310 (\\"Graphic Escape APL/TN\\") includes a larger gamut of symbols, but does not itself include the basic Latin letters or the basic digits. It is used alongside Code page 037, with the Code page 310 codes being prefixed by the Graphic Escape (EBCDIC 0x08) control character. Code page 351 (\\"GDDM Default (USA)\\") contains most of these additional symbols in addition to the letters and digits, by replacing several control characters with symbols. Other pre-Unicode code pages Code page 907 is an 8-bit extended ASCII code page intended for use with APL. ISO-IR-68 is a 7-bit heavily modified ASCII intended for use with APL in an environment allowing overstriking of characters. Unicode Most APL symbols are present in Unicode, in the Miscellaneous Technical range, although some APL products may not yet feature Unicode, and some APL symbols may be unused or unavailable in a given vendor's implementation. Missing from Unicode are the traditional underscored alphabetic characters; their usage has been eliminated or deprecated in most APL implementations. As of 2010, Unicode allows APL to be stored in text files, published in print and on the web, and shared through email and instant messaging. Entering APL characters still requires the use of either a specific input method editor or keyboard mapping, or of a specific touch interface. APL keyboard mappings are available for free for the most common operating systems, or can be obtained by adding the Unicode APL symbols to existing keyboard map. Keyboard layout Note the mnemonics associating an APL character with a letter: (question mark) on , (power) on , (rho) on , (base value) on , (eNcode) on , (modulus) on and so on. This makes it easier for an English-language speaker to type APL on a non- APL keyboard, providing one has visual feedback on one's screen. Also, decals have been produced for attachment to standard keyboards, either on the front of the keys or on the top of them. Image:APL- keybd2.svg600pxthumbcenterAPL keyboard layout. A more up-to-date keyboard diagram, applicable for APL2 and other modern implementations, is available at WikensOnline Union APL large keyboard layout for Windows , actual photo + diagram here and NARS2000 APL keyboard layout here. Later IBM terminals, notably the IBM 3270 display stations, had an alternate keyboard arrangement which is the basis for some of the modern APL keyboard layouts in use today. Further APL characters were available by overstriking one character with another. For example, the log symbol (‚çü) was formed by overstriking with . This extended the graphic abilities of the earlier teleprinters, but made it more complex to correct errors and edit program lines. New overstrikes were introduced by vendors as they produced versions of APL tailored to specific hardware, system features, file systems, and so on. Further, printing terminals and early APL cathode-ray terminals were able to display arbitrary overstrikes, but as personal computers rapidly replaced terminals as a data- entry device, APL character support became provided as an APL Character Generator ROM or a soft character set rendered by the display device. With the advent of the modern PC, APL characters were defined in specific fonts, eliminating the distinction between overstruck characters and standard characters. Finally, the symbols were ratified in Unicode and given specific code points, with unambiguous interpretations, independently of the graphic font.

Feimster, Associate Professor of African American Studies at Yale University, wrote: Equality is a deeply researched, beautifully written, and brilliantly argued history of the epic struggle to define the meaning of equality in post-Civil War America. This magnificent portrait of the farmers' Grange, the Women's Christian Temperance Union, and the Knights of Labor is filled with fresh insights into the social movements that took root during Reconstruction and blossomed in the Gilded Age. Confronting some of the most difficult questions in American history, Postel adds new dimensions to our understanding of the racial, gender, and class inequalities that continue to shape our social and political landscape.\\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781429946926 Awards * 2008 Bancroft Prize * 2008 Frederick Jackson Turner Award Works * * *\\"What We Talk about When We Talk about Populism,\\" Raritan: A Quarterly Review, Fall 2017, vol. 37, no. 2 *Trump and Sanders Are Both Populists, What Does Populism Mean?\\" The American Historian (August 2016) References External links *SFSU Department of History Faculty Category:21st-century American historians Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:San Francisco State University faculty Category:Living people Category:1954 births ","title":"Charles Postel"},{"id":"24955689","text":"Ortgiesia is a subgenus of the genus Aechmea.

Fossil is a science fiction book by American writer Hal Clement, first printed in November, 1993. Copyright was reserved to him under his real name, Harry C. Stubbs and the company he associated himself with, Tomorrow, Inc.. Plot summary On a medium-sized, low-gravity planet with a very slow rotational period, the side that is farthest from the sun is always a very hard mixture of frozen carbon dioxide, rock hard ammonia, and solid water ice, and the side that is closest, a sea of turbulent liquids and icebergs. The planet rotates so slowly that the part that is half ice and half ocean is constantly beset with troubling weather conditions, ranging from blizzards to unanticipated ice melts and earthquakes. It takes centuries if not thousands of years for the wobbling of the planet on the ecliptic to melt certain parts of the planet. Even still, it is possible for the planet to have become locked in orbit, so the farthest side never melts. The tidal locking of the planet may have occurred hundreds of millions of years ago, and seasons appear to be limited to the slight wobbling of the planet on the ecliptic. Far from being an uninteresting planet, the ecliptic along which the planet travels is also tilted. Most of the colonies are located along the \\"coast\\" - the place in a murky half-shadow of constant night and constant day. Scientific researchers from all kinds of alien species from all over the known universe have come to this planet to engage in an arduous archaeological expedition to unearth mysterious fossils from deep within the multi-kilometer thick icy crust. They have dug so deep that it is generally considered dangerous to dig any deeper. On some of the worlds around the galaxy, mysterious relics are found from an earlier civilization that no longer exists. Since the planet has almost no rock at its core, and enjoyed a rotational period for the first couple billion years of its existence, there is probably nothing to find here, short of fossils of earlier species once flourishing on the planet, but now extinct.  Universe  In Isaac's universe, there are several highly intelligent species of aliens, all of whom are capable of learning from each other, and appropriating devices and inventions for their own purpose. Not counting humans as intelligent beings, there are also intelligent snakes as big as pythons, winged arthropodic human- sized insect beings, whale-like beings confined to a liquid environment, and saurian reptilian creatures. There is also an indistinct massive being without any arms or legs or mouths, but obtains its nutrition by dissolving its food through its hide, and although it does not move fast, it thinks very long and deeply. Plot twist When two human researchers obtain permission to come on board the planet's surface, and personally oversee the Safety Committee, the other species are sure this is a mistake. Matters get even worse when the humans are observed skiing and leaping off the ski jumps they have built there. The humans assure the other species that there is nothing hazardous because there is so little gravity on this planet. Most of the species think having the humans on board, and engaged in these kinds of sports, is a recipe for disaster. The human researchers don't seem to realize they aren't being taken seriously, and are only there because of the political pressure applied on their governments at home. At least some of the aliens think it would be just fine if the humans were rubbed out, or at least relocated to a safer (or less important) part of the planet. One of the winged species appears to have evolved on the planet because fossils of these creatures have been found kilometers under the surface, wedged into the rocks of ice down there, and from the condition of the fossils, the wings were rudimentary. If this particular winged species actually did evolve on this planet, it would be a huge public relations victory elsewhere in the known universe, as it would appear to validate their claim that they were the first intelligent species in the galaxy, and therefore heir to intellectual property remaining in many lost ruins across the galaxy. It is the goal of the human researchers to find out if some of the fossils have been fabricated and planted there, and whether any interlopers have arrived to interrupt their mission's progress. To help determine whether the fossils are fraudulent, samples are sent off for DNA analysis. However, the results are very troubling, as some of the fossils are apparently authentic.

Magnified version of the same image. Stochastic screening or FM screening is a halftone process based on pseudo- random distribution of halftone dots, using frequency modulation (FM) to change the density of dots according to the gray level desired. Traditional amplitude modulation halftone screening is based on a geometric and fixed spacing of dots, which vary in size depending on the tone color represented (for example, from 10 to 200 micrometres). The stochastic screening or FM screening instead uses a fixed size of dots (for example, about 25 micrometres) and a distribution density that varies depending on the color‚Äôs tone. The technique of stochastic screening, which has existed since the seventies, has had a revival in recent times thanks to increased use of computer-to-plate (CTP) techniques. In previous techniques, computer to film, during the exposure there could be a drastic variation in the quality of the plate. It was a very delicate and difficult procedure that was not much used. Today, with CTP during the creation of the plate you just need to check a few parameters on the density and tonal correction curve. When you make a plate with stochastic screening you must use a tone correction curve, this curve allows one to align the tone reproduction of an FM screen to that of an industry standard. Given the same final presswork tone value, an FM screen utilizes more halftone dots than an AM/XM screen. The result is that more light is filtered by the ink and less light simply reflects off the surface of the substrate. The result is that FM screens exhibit a greater color gamut than conventional AM/XM halftone screen frequencies. The creation of a plate with stochastic screening is done the same way as is done with an AM/XM screen. A tone reproduction compensation curve is typically applied to align the stochastic screening to conventional AM/FM tone reproductions targets (e.g. ISO 12647-2). Advantages * The screening of four colors is no longer made with four different angles as with the traditional screen therefore it eliminates screening moir√©. * FM screening does not create rosette patterns. * Halftone dot sizes can be as fine as 10 micrometres, which gives the product a quality comparable to that of photographic prints. * The effects of misregistration are not completely eliminated, but the effect is certainly less apparent than in the traditional screening, this feature is very favorable for printing on rotary machines where the misregistration is very common due to effects such as web growth. * The use of FM screening allowed Archant, a UK regional publisher, to switch to fonts with \\"tiny holes\\"; such an \\"eco-font\\" permitted a reduction in ink without turning fine text grainy. Disadvantages The small dots used in FM screening require special care and cleanliness, especially when plates are made from films.

He is best known as an early employee and key technical contributor at the original Napster, the file-sharing service created by Shawn Fanning in 1999, and at SNOCAP, the digital rights and content management startup Fanning founded after Napster. He was also chief operating officer of imeem, which acquired SNOCAP in 2008. Early life Ali Aydar was born to a Turkish family in Richmond, Virginia and grew up in Napoleon, Michigan. In high school, he ran a Bulletin board system by the name of \\"Awesome Fred's BBS\\". After high school, he attended Carnegie Mellon University, where he majored in mathematics and computer science. While there, Aydar was a contributor to the Free Internet Chess Server, an open-source project that enabled people to play online chess for free. This experience led to Aydar co-founding online chess startup chess.net with John Fanning, the uncle of Napster creator Shawn Fanning, in 1996. Career While working at chess.net, Aydar first met Fanning's then 15-year-old nephew, Shawn. In All the Rave, Joseph Menn notes that Shawn interned for chess.net in the summer of 1997, sleeping on a couch in the living room. That summer, Aydar and the other chess.net employees became close with the younger Fanning, who was just learning computer programming. Aydar bought Fanning his first book on programming in C++, the language he would use two years later to build the Napster file-sharing software.Napster wounds the giant : Music : The Rocky Mountain News Napster After leaving chess.net, Aydar moved to Chicago, where he worked as a banker. In late 1998, Shawn Fanning contacted Aydar via instant messenger to tell him about a software application he was writing that would enable people to share music. Fanning was then a freshman at Northeastern University. In August 1999, Aydar moved to California's Silicon Valley to work for a startup. Within weeks, he was recruited to join Napster. He joined in September 1999, becoming its first non-founding employee.Banking on Snocap / After alienating music industry, Napster founder tries to help it - SFGate Initially, Aydar was an individual contributor to Napster's engineering team.

It was founded in 1949 in West Germany. The purpose of the Customs Service is to administer federal taxes, execute demands for payment on behalf of the federal government and federal statutory corporations, monitor the cross border movements of goods with regard to compliance with bans and restrictions, and prevent illicit work.Der Zoll: Von der Grenze zu (fast) grenzenlosen M√∂glichkeiten , aufgerufen am 28. Juni 2009  Mission  The Customs Service, as part of the Finanzverwaltung (fiscal administration), ensures the flow of revenue from federal trade tariffs and taxes (excise taxes‚ÄîBranntwein taxes, electricity taxes, tobacco taxes, energy taxes, etc., including the beer tax, the revenues from which go to the German states), as well as revenues of the European Union (75% of all tariff income goes to the EU, 25% are retained to cover expenses and go to the federal government). The Customs Service is responsible for monitoring the importing, transit and exporting of goods and monitors compliance with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Its core duties include the prevention of the illegal import or export of weapons, drugs and other dangerous substances, as well as other forbidden items. Enforcement agency Patrol ship (Zollkreuzer) Helgoland (a SWATH-Vessel) Vehicle of the Bundeszollverwaltung in Germany The Customs Service's enforcement duties include monitoring the movement of goods into, through and out of the EU with respect to customs law, border police work, general police work in road traffic, protection of the German continental shelf in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea (more precisely, monitoring of underwater mining and exploration rights), as well as the fight against illicit work and money laundering. The Maritime Customs Service together with other agencies makes up the German Federal Coast Guard. The enforcement elements of the Customs Service in many areas cooperate strongly with the police forces of the German states and the federal police. They are law enforcement agencies and are also used to combat terrorism.  Execution agency  The Federal Customs Service executes demands for payment by the federal government and federal legal persons under public law, for example, the Bundesagentur f√ºr Arbeit (the government employment agency). The civil servants in question have the right, just like bailiffs, to impound items and real estate, and to dispose of these.  Auctioneer  Auctions regularly take place at offices of the Customs Service that are responsible for a certain category of objects. Items are auctioned off that have been impounded or that have been designated for disposal by agencies. Apart from the Customs Service, other agencies and administrations also use this service for auctioning off items. Some objects are excepted from these auctions, namely impounded goods such as: * Animals and plants: if these are classed as endangered, or threatened by extinction, they fall under the protection of CITES. Dead animals and plants may be left to public institutions for educational and exhibition purposes on demand (e.g. schools, museums, universities); living ones are transferred to zoological or botanical institutions. * Cigarettes and other tobacco products, as these can only be put on the market if they comply with the provisions of the Tobacco Taxation Law. * Narcotics (drugs) * Weapons: if these are of the sort that may be legally sold to those in possession of a permit (and are not classed as military weapons), they will be disposed of directly through the procurement office of the Customs Service in Offenbach am Main.

Fuentes was the president of the city council in Camden, New Jersey's seventh-largest city, serving from 2000 to 2010, stepping down to take the Assembly seat. He resigned from his Assembly seat in June 2015 in order to become a deputy clerk for Camden County. Early life and education Fuentes was raised in Camden, where he graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School. He then attended St. John Vianney College Seminary in Miami, Florida, earning a B.A. degree in philosophy. He then successfully pursued certification by the state of New Jersey as a social worker. Camden City Council Fuentes represented Camden's Fourth Ward, which includes Downtown Camden, the Camden Waterfront, and the North Camden, Cramer Hill, and Cooper Grant neighborhoods. He resides in the Cramer Hill neighborhood. As a city councilman, Fuentes was a major proponent of youth and senior citizens' programs, efforts toward social justice, and anti-crime efforts. During his tenure on the council, Fuentes helped to create or spearheaded the creation of a Citizen Public Safety Council, Ethics and Municipal Human Relations Commissions, a Taxicab Commission, a Public Safety Council, and an Asian American Advisory Board. Notably, Fuentes has led a crusade against graffiti in the city of Camden, which included the establishment of an anti-graffiti task force, the implementation of an anti-graffiti curriculum in local schools, and a related hotline. Favoring efficiency and accountability in government, Fuentes published a Ten Point Plan for city government reform. Fuentes enjoys close ties with the Save Our Waterfront in North Camden organization and the Cramer Hill Neighborhood Advisory Board. Other activities Beyond the city council, Fuentes serves on the Strategic Planning Committee for the United States Hispanic Leadership Institute. He is a member of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. He also serves on the boards of directors for the Camden County Chapter of the American Red Cross, the Greater Camden Partnership, and the Cooper's Ferry Development Board. In 1997, he was recognized by the Camden County Office of Hispanic Affairs & Community Development as an Outstanding Community Leader. Since then he has received addition public service awards from the American Red Cross, the Peace Troopers of Camden City, and the faith-based initiative Christian Quarterly, Inc., among others. New Jersey General Assembly In 2009, both incumbent Democratic Assembly members, Nilsa Cruz-Perez and Joseph J. Roberts announced their retirements from the Assembly. In the general election, Fuentes and running mate Donald Norcross soundly defeated the Republican nominees, Brian Kluchnick and Stepfanie Velez-Gentry. Norcross would be appointed to a vacant Senate seat about a week after being sworn into the Assembly; Gilbert \\"Whip\\" Wilson would become Fuentes's 5th District Assembly partner for the remainder of his time there. After being re-elected in 2011 and 2013, Fuentes again won the Democratic nomination for an Assembly seat in 2015 before being tapped to become a deputy clerk for Camden County Clerk Joseph Ripa. Though under state law he would not have to resign to take the position, he submitted his resignation effective June 30. The Camden and Gloucester County Democratic Committees will name his replacement on the 2015 general election ballot and nominate a person to fill the remainder of Fuentes's Assembly term.

The player faces barriers to success, including doors (some locked), electronic doors, L.E.D. doors, barriers that will not allow cargo to cross them, and armored obstacles that can be destroyed only with continuous fire. The player can find devices to assist in this endeavor, from electric railways to portable batteries that give power to the railway. The player can also find safe zones and teleporters, as well as force mirrors that can be diagonal and four-way in nature. Reception The game was reviewed in 1993 in Dragon #196 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.

He was previously a member of the New Jersey General Assembly, and was appointed to the State Senate in 2019 following the death of his father, incumbent Senator Anthony Bucco. New Jersey Assembly After Assemblyman Rick Merkt announced that he would run for the Republican nomination for Governor of New Jersey rather than seek re- election in 2009, Bucco announced that he would run for Merkt's seat, which was previously held by his father, Anthony R. Bucco, from 1995 to 1999. Morris County Freeholder Douglas Cabana, the brother of Bucco's wife Amy, also announced his candidacy. Cabana's campaign emphasized his many years in elective office as a Boonton Township Councilman, Boonton Township Mayor, and Freeholder, contrasting this with Bucco's lack of experience in elective office. Bucco countered by accusing Cabana of running a negative campaign, pointing to a Cabana mailer containing \\"unpleasant photos\\" of Bucco and \\"some misinformation.\\" Bucco defeated Cabana by less than 800 votes in the Republican primary. He and running mate Michael Patrick Carroll, a veteran assemblyman, won the general election easily in the heavily Republican 25th district. The two would be reelected in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017. After his father's death on September 16, 2019, Bucco announced his candidacy for the State Senate vacancy while maintaining his campaign for reelection to the Assembly. Bucco won the appointment to the Senate in a special convention of 25th district Republican committeemembers held on October 15, 2019 and subsequently won the Assembly seat for which he was running in the November general election.

During the first, Washington traveled to Ley's home from Valley Forge, where the Continental Army was encamped, for a brief respite from his military command duties. On two subsequent visits, he specifically visited the property to inspect work on four locks that were under construction there as part of Pennsylvania's Union Canal system.\\"History,\\" Tulpehocken Manor. Despite the close connection with America's first President and Michael Ley's own service as an officer in the Continental Army, though, the Ley family underwent serious financial hardships following the Revolutionary War. Having spent significant sums of money to support Washington's troops during the war and then having also lost heavily when their coal industry speculations failed post-war, they were forced to repeatedly mortgage their property until finally losing it in a sheriff's sale in 1834 to Conrad Loos. Loos then subsequently transferred the home and land to his daughter, Elizabeth, and her husband, Cyrus Shark. Their daughter, Eliza, then became the owner during the 1880s after her husband, Samuel Urich, purchased the property. During their tenure of ownership, they remodeled and enlarged the residence into a 27-room Victorian manor house with a mansard roof, a process which took place between 1883 and 1885. Subsequently purchasing two houses and land to the east from the Spangler family, they also then bought a small frame house on the western side of the property in 1886.

Coming of age during the Weimar Republic, he had his first successes as a playwright in Munich and moved to Berlin in 1924, where he wrote The Threepenny Opera with Kurt Weill and began a lifelong collaboration with the composer Hanns Eisler. Immersed in Marxist thought during this period, he wrote didactic Lehrst√ºcke and became a leading theoretician of epic theatre (which he later preferred to call \\"dialectical theatre\\") and the so-called V-effect. During the Nazi period, Bertolt Brecht lived in exile, first in Scandinavia, and during World War II in the United States, where he was surveilled by the FBIJohn Willet, commentary to Bertolt Brecht Letters 1913-1956 (NY 1990) pp. 312-13 and subpoenaed by the House Un- American Activities Committee. Returning to East Berlin after the war, he established the theatre company Berliner Ensemble with his wife and long-time collaborator, actress Helene Weigel.The introduction of this article draws on the following sources: Banham (1998, 129); B√ºrger (1984, 87‚Äì92); Jameson (1998, 43‚Äì58); Kolocotroni, Goldman and Taxidou (1998, 465‚Äì466); Williams (1993, 277‚Äì290); Wright (1989, 68‚Äì89; 113‚Äì137).  Life and career   Bavaria (1898‚Äì1924)  Eugen Berthold Friedrich Brecht (as a child known as Eugen) was born on 10 February 1898 in Augsburg, Germany, the son of Berthold Friedrich Brecht (1869‚Äì1939) and his wife Sophie, n√©e Brezing (1871‚Äì1920). Brecht's mother was a devout Protestant and his father a Roman Catholic (who had been persuaded to have a Protestant wedding). The modest house where he was born is today preserved as a Brecht Museum. His father worked for a paper mill, becoming its managing director in 1914.Thomson (1994). Due to his mother's influence, Brecht knew the Bible, a familiarity that would have a lifelong effect on his writing. From her, too, came the \\"dangerous image of the self-denying woman\\" that recurs in his drama.Thomson (1994, 22‚Äì23). See also Smith (1991). Brecht's home life was comfortably middle class, despite what his occasional attempt to claim peasant origins implied.See Brecht's poem \\"Of Poor B.B.\\" (first version, 1922), in Brecht (2000b, 107‚Äì108). At school in Augsburg he met Caspar Neher, with whom he formed a lifelong creative partnership. Neher designed many of the sets for Brecht's dramas and helped to forge the distinctive visual iconography of their epic theatre. When Brecht was 16, the First World War broke out. Initially enthusiastic, Brecht soon changed his mind on seeing his classmates \\"swallowed by the army\\". Brecht was nearly expelled from school in 1915 for writing an essay in response to the line \\"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori\\" from the Roman poet Horace, calling it Zweckpropaganda (\\"cheap propaganda for a specific purpose\\") and arguing that only an empty-headed person could be persuaded to die for their country. His expulsion was only prevented by the intervention of Romuald Sauer, a priest who also served as a substitute teacher at Brecht's school. On his father's recommendation, Brecht sought to avoid being conscripted into the army by exploiting a loophole which allowed for medical students to be deferred. He subsequently registered for a medical course at Munich University, where he enrolled in 1917.Thomson (1994, 24) and Sacks (xvii). There he studied drama with Arthur Kutscher, who inspired in the young Brecht an admiration for the iconoclastic dramatist and cabaret star Frank Wedekind.Thomson (1994, 24). In his Messingkauf Dialogues, Brecht cites Wedekind, along with B√ºchner and Valentin, as his \\"chief influences\\" in his early years: \\"he,\\" Brecht writes of himself in the third person, \\"also saw the writer Wedekind performing his own works in a style which he had developed in cabaret. Wedekind had worked as a ballad singer; he accompanied himself on the lute.\\" (1965, 69). Kutscher was \\"bitterly critical\\" of Brecht's own early dramatic writings (Willet and Manheim 1970, vii). From July 1916, Brecht's newspaper articles began appearing under the new name \\"Bert Brecht\\" (his first theatre criticism for the Augsburger Volkswille appeared in October 1919).Thomson (1994, 24) and Willett (1967, 17). Brecht was drafted into military service in the autumn of 1918, only to be posted back to Augsburg as a medical orderly in a military VD clinic; the war ended a month later. In July 1919, Brecht and Paula Banholzer (who had begun a relationship in 1917) had a son, Frank. In 1920 Brecht's mother died.Willett and Manheim (1970, vii). Some time in either 1920 or 1921, Brecht took a small part in the political cabaret of the Munich comedian Karl Valentin.Sacks (1994, xx) and McDowell (1977). Brecht's diaries for the next few years record numerous visits to see Valentin perform.McDowell (2000). Brecht compared Valentin to Charlie Chaplin, for his \\"virtually complete rejection of mimicry and cheap psychology\\".Willett and Manheim 1970, x. Writing in his Messingkauf Dialogues years later, Brecht identified Valentin, along with Wedekind and B√ºchner, as his \\"chief influences\\" at that time: Brecht's first full-length play, Baal (written 1918), arose in response to an argument in one of Kutscher's drama seminars, initiating a trend that persisted throughout his career of creative activity that was generated by a desire to counter another work (both others' and his own, as his many adaptations and re-writes attest). \\"Anyone can be creative,\\" he quipped, \\"it's rewriting other people that's a challenge.\\"Quoted in Thomson (1994, 25). Brecht completed his second major play, Drums in the Night, in February 1919. Between November 1921 and April 1922 Brecht made acquaintance with many influential people in the Berlin cultural scene. Amongst them was the playwright Arnolt Bronnen with whom he established a joint venture, the Arnolt Bronnen / Bertolt Brecht Company. Brecht changed the spelling of his first name to Bertolt to rhyme with Arnolt. In 1922 while still living in Munich, Brecht came to the attention of an influential Berlin critic, Herbert Ihering: \\"At 24 the writer Bert Brecht has changed Germany's literary complexion overnight\\"‚Äîhe enthused in his review of Brecht's first play to be produced, Drums in the Night‚Äî\\"[he] has given our time a new tone, a new melody, a new vision. [...] It is a language you can feel on your tongue, in your gums, your ear, your spinal column.\\"Herbert Ihering's review for Drums in the Night in the Berliner B√∂rsen-Courier on 5 October 1922. Quoted in Willett and Manheim (1970, viii‚Äìix). In November it was announced that Brecht had been awarded the prestigious Kleist Prize (intended for unestablished writers and probably Germany's most significant literary award, until it was abolished in 1932) for his first three plays (Baal, Drums in the Night, and In the Jungle, although at that point only Drums had been produced).See Thomson and Sacks (1994, 50) and Willett and Manheim (1970, viii‚Äìix). The citation for the award insisted that: \\"[Brecht's] language is vivid without being deliberately poetic, symbolical without being over literary. Brecht is a dramatist because his language is felt physically and in the round.\\"Herbert Ihering, quoted in Willett and Manheim (1970, ix). That year he married the Viennese opera singer Marianne Zoff. Their daughter, Hanne Hiob, born in March 1923, was a successful German actress. In 1923, Brecht wrote a scenario for what was to become a short slapstick film, Mysteries of a Barbershop, directed by Erich Engel and starring Karl Valentin.McDowell (1977). Despite a lack of success at the time, its experimental inventiveness and the subsequent success of many of its contributors have meant that it is now considered one of the most important films in German film history.Culbert (1995). In May of that year, Brecht's In the Jungle premiered in Munich, also directed by Engel. Opening night proved to be a \\"scandal\\"‚Äîa phenomenon that would characterize many of his later productions during the Weimar Republic‚Äîin which Nazis blew whistles and threw stink bombs at the actors on the stage. In 1924 Brecht worked with the novelist and playwright Lion Feuchtwanger (whom he had met in 1919) on an adaptation of Christopher Marlowe's Edward II that proved to be a milestone in Brecht's early theatrical and dramaturgical development.Thomson (1994, 26‚Äì27), Meech (1994, 54‚Äì55). Brecht's Edward II constituted his first attempt at collaborative writing and was the first of many classic texts he was to adapt. As his first solo directorial d√©but, he later credited it as the germ of his conception of \\"epic theatre\\".Meech (1994, 54‚Äì55) and Benjamin (1983, 115). See the article on Edward II for details of Brecht's germinal 'epic' ideas and techniques in this production. That September, a job as assistant dramaturg at Max Reinhardt's Deutsches Theater‚Äîat the time one of the leading three or four theatres in the world‚Äîbrought him to Berlin.Brecht was recommended for the job by Erich Engel; Carl Zuckmayer was to join Brecht in the position. See Sacks (1994, xviii), Willett (1967, 145), and Willett and Manheim (1970, vii).  Weimar Republic Berlin (1925‚Äì1933)  In 1923 Brecht's marriage to Zoff began to break down (though they did not divorce until 1927).Ewen (1967, 159) and V√∂lker (1976, 65). Brecht had become involved with both Elisabeth Hauptmann and Helene Weigel.Thomson (1994, 28). Brecht and Weigel's son, Stefan, was born in October 1924.Hayman (104) and V√∂lker (1976, 108). In his role as dramaturg, Brecht had much to stimulate him but little work of his own.According to Willett, Brecht was disgruntled with the Deutsches Theater at not being given a Shakespeare production to direct. At the end of the 1924‚Äì1925 season, both his and Carl Zuckmayer's (his fellow dramaturg) contracts were not renewed. (Willett 1967, 145). Zuckmayer relates how: \\"Brecht seldom turned up there; with his flapping leather jacket he looked like a cross between a lorry driver and a Jesuit seminarist. Roughly speaking, what he wanted was to take over complete control; the season's programme must be regulated entirely according to his theories, and the stage be rechristened 'epic smoke theatre', it being his view that people might actually be disposed to think if they were allowed to smoke at the same time. As this was refused him he confined himself to coming and drawing his pay.\\" (Quoted by Willett 1967, 145). Reinhardt staged Shaw's Saint Joan, Goldoni's Servant of Two Masters (with the improvisational approach of the commedia dell'arte in which the actors chatted with the prompter about their roles), and Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author in his group of Berlin theatres.Willett (1967, 145). A new version of Brecht's third play, now entitled Jungle: Decline of a Family, opened at the Deutsches Theater in October 1924, but was not a success.Willett and Manheim (1979, viii). At this time Brecht revised his important \\"transitional poem\\", \\"Of Poor BB\\".Willett and Manheim point to the significance of this poem as a marker of the shift in Brecht's work towards \\"a much more urban, industrialized flavour\\" (1979, viii). In 1925, his publishers provided him with Elisabeth Hauptmann as an assistant for the completion of his collection of poems, Devotions for the Home (Hauspostille, eventually published in January 1927). She continued to work with him after the publisher's commission ran out.Willett and Manheim (1979, viii, x). In 1925 in Mannheim the artistic exhibition Neue Sachlichkeit (\\"New Objectivity\\") had given its name to the new post-Expressionist movement in the German arts. With little to do at the Deutsches Theater, Brecht began to develop his Man Equals Man project, which was to become the first product of \\"the 'Brecht collective'‚Äîthat shifting group of friends and collaborators on whom he henceforward depended.\\"Willett and Manheim (1979, viii); Joel Schechter writes: \\"The subjugation of an individual to that of a collective was endorsed by the affirmations of comedy, and by the decision of the coauthors of Man is Man (Emil Burri, Slatan Dudow, Caspar Neher, Bernhard Reich, Elisabeth Hauptmann) to call themselves 'The Brecht Collective'.\\" (1994, 74). This collaborative approach to artistic production, together with aspects of Brecht's writing and style of theatrical production, mark Brecht's work from this period as part of the Neue Sachlichkeit movement.Willett (1978). The collective's work \\"mirrored the artistic climate of the middle 1920s,\\" Willett and Manheim argue: > with their attitude of Neue Sachlichkeit (or New Matter-of-Factness), their > stressing of the collectivity and downplaying of the individual, and their > new cult of Anglo-Saxon imagery and sport. Together the \\"collective\\" would > go to fights, not only absorbing their terminology and ethos (which > permeates Man Equals Man) but also drawing those conclusions for the theatre > as a whole which Brecht set down in his theoretical essay \\"Emphasis on > Sport\\" and tried to realise by means of the harsh lighting, the boxing-ring > stage and other anti-illusionistic devices that henceforward appeared in his > own productions.Willett and Manheim (1979, viii‚Äìix). In 1925, Brecht also saw two films that had a significant influence on him: Chaplin's The Gold Rush and Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin.Willett and Manheim (1979, xxxiii). Brecht had compared Valentin to Chaplin, and the two of them provided models for Galy Gay in Man Equals Man.Schechter (1994, 68). Brecht later wrote that Chaplin \\"would in many ways come closer to the epic than to the dramatic theatre's requirements.\\" They met several times during Brecht's time in the United States, and discussed Chaplin's Monsieur Verdoux project, which it is possible Brecht influenced.Schechter (1994, 72). In 1926 a series of short stories was published under Brecht's name, though Hauptmann was closely associated with writing them.Sacks (1994, xviii). Following the production of Man Equals Man in Darmstadt that year, Brecht began studying Marxism and socialism in earnest, under the supervision of Hauptmann.Thomson (1994, 28‚Äì29). \\"When I read Marx's Capital\\", a note by Brecht reveals, \\"I understood my plays.\\" Marx was, it continues, \\"the only spectator for my plays I'd ever come across.\\" Inspired by the developments in USSR Brecht wrote a number of agitprop plays, praising the bolshevik collectivism (replaceability of each member of the collective in Man Equals Man) and red terror (The Decision). In 1927 Brecht became part of the \\"dramaturgical collective\\" of Erwin Piscator's first company, which was designed to tackle the problem of finding new plays for its \\"epic, political, confrontational, documentary theatre\\".Willett (1998, 103) and (1978, 72). In his book The Political Theatre, Piscator wrote: \\"Perhaps my whole style of directing is a direct result of the total lack of suitable plays. It would certainly not have taken so dominant form if adequate plays had been on hand when I started\\" (1929, 185). Brecht collaborated with Piscator during the period of the latter's landmark productions, Hoppla, We're Alive! by Toller, Rasputin, The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik, and Konjunktur by Lania.Willett (1978, 74). Brecht's most significant contribution was to the adaptation of the unfinished episodic comic novel Schweik, which he later described as a \\"montage from the novel\\".See Brecht's Journal entry for 24 June 1943. Brecht claimed to have written the adaptation (in his Journal entry), but Piscator contested that; the manuscript bears the names \\"Brecht, [Felix] Gasbarra, Piscator, G. Grosz\\" in Brecht's handwriting (Willett 1978, 110). See also Willett (1978, 90‚Äì95). Brecht wrote a sequel to the novel in 1943, Schweik in the Second World War. The Piscator productions influenced Brecht's ideas about staging and design, and alerted him to the radical potentials offered to the \\"epic\\" playwright by the development of stage technology (particularly projections).Willett (1998, 104). In relation to his innovations in the use of theatre technology, Piscator wrote: \\"technical innovations were never an end in themselves for me. Any means I have used or am currently in the process of using were designed to elevate the events on the stage onto a historical plane and not just to enlarge the technical range of the stage machinery. My technical devices had been developed to cover up the deficiencies of the dramatists' products\\" (\\"Basic Principles of a Sociological Drama\\" [1929]; in Kolocotroni, Goldman and Taxidou [1998, 243]). What Brecht took from Piscator \\"is fairly plain, and he acknowledged it\\" Willett suggests: > The emphasis on Reason and didacticism, the sense that the new subject > matter demanded a new dramatic form, the use of songs to interrupt and > comment: all these are found in his notes and essays of the 1920s, and he > bolstered them by citing such Piscatorial examples as the step-by-step > narrative technique of Schweik and the oil interests handled in Konjunktur > ('Petroleum resists the five-act form').Willett (1978, 109‚Äì110).

See also > Willett (1998, 104‚Äì105). Brecht was struggling at the time with the question of how to dramatize the complex economic relationships of modern capitalism in his unfinished project Joe P. Fleischhacker (which Piscator's theatre announced in its programme for the 1927‚Äì28 season). It wasn't until his Saint Joan of the Stockyards (written between 1929‚Äì1931) that Brecht solved it.Willett (1998, 104‚Äì105). In 1928 he discussed with Piscator plans to stage Shakespeare's Julius Caesar and Brecht's own Drums in the Night, but the productions did not materialize.Willett (1978, 76). 1927 also saw the first collaboration between Brecht and the young composer Kurt Weill.The two first met in March 1927, after Weill had written a critical introduction to the broadcast on Berlin Radio of an adaptation of Brecht's Man Equals Man. When they met, Brecht was 29 years old and Weill was 27. Brecht had experience of writing songs and had performed his own with tunes he had composed; at the time he was also married to an opera singer (Zoff). Weill had collaborated with Georg Kaiser, one of the few Expressionist playwrights that Brecht admired; he was married to the actress Lotte Lenya. Willett and Manheim (1979, xv). Together they began to develop Brecht's Mahagonny project, along thematic lines of the biblical Cities of the Plain but rendered in terms of the Neue Sachlichkeit's Amerikanismus, which had informed Brecht's previous work.Willet and Manheim (1979, xv‚Äìxviii). In Munich in 1924 Brecht had begun referring to some of the stranger aspects of life in post-putsch Bavaria under the codename \\"Mahagonny\\". The Amerikanismus imagery appears in his first three \\"Mahagonny Songs\\", with their Wild West references. With that, however, the project stalled for two and a half years. With Hauptmann, who wrote the two English- language \\"Mahagonny Songs\\", Brecht had begun work on an opera to be called Sodom and Gomorrah or The Man from Manhattan and a radio play called The Flood or 'The Collapse of Miami, the Paradise City', both of which came to underlie the new scheme with Weill. See Willett and Manheim (1979, xv‚Äìxvi). The influence of Amerikanismus is most clearly discernible in Brecht's In the Jungle of Cities. They produced The Little Mahagonny for a music festival in July, as what Weill called a \\"stylistic exercise\\" in preparation for the large-scale piece. From that point on Caspar Neher became an integral part of the collaborative effort, with words, music and visuals conceived in relation to one another from the start.In this respect, the creative process for Mahagonny was quite different from The Threepenny Opera, with the former being durchkomponiert or set to music right through, whereas on the latter Weill was brought at a late stage to set the songs. See Willett and Manheim (1979, xv). The model for their mutual articulation lay in Brecht's newly formulated principle of the \\"separation of the elements\\", which he first outlined in \\"The Modern Theatre Is the Epic Theatre\\" (1930). The principle, a variety of montage, proposed by-passing the \\"great struggle for supremacy between words, music and production\\" as Brecht put it, by showing each as self-contained, independent works of art that adopt attitudes towards one another.Willett and Manheim (1979, xvii) and . Stamp from the former East Germany depicting Brecht and a scene from his Life of Galileo In 1930 Brecht married Weigel; their daughter Barbara Brecht was born soon after the wedding. She also became an actress and would later share the copyrights of Brecht's work with her siblings. Brecht formed a writing collective which became prolific and very influential. Elisabeth Hauptmann, Margarete Steffin, Emil Burri, Ruth Berlau and others worked with Brecht and produced the multiple teaching plays, which attempted to create a new dramaturgy for participants rather than passive audiences. These addressed themselves to the massive worker arts organisation that existed in Germany and Austria in the 1920s. So did Brecht's first great play, Saint Joan of the Stockyards, which attempts to portray the drama in financial transactions. This collective adapted John Gay's The Beggar's Opera, with Brecht's lyrics set to music by Kurt Weill. Retitled The Threepenny Opera (Die Dreigroschenoper) it was the biggest hit in Berlin of the 1920s and a renewing influence on the musical worldwide. One of its most famous lines underscored the hypocrisy of conventional morality imposed by the Church, working in conjunction with the established order, in the face of working- class hunger and deprivation: {Erst kommt das Fressen Dann kommt die Moral. First the grub (lit. \\"eating like animals, gorging\\") Then the morality. } The success of The Threepenny Opera was followed by the quickly thrown together Happy End. It was a personal and a commercial failure. At the time the book was purported to be by the mysterious Dorothy Lane (now known to be Elisabeth Hauptmann, Brecht's secretary and close collaborator). Brecht only claimed authorship of the song texts. Brecht would later use elements of Happy End as the germ for his Saint Joan of the Stockyards, a play that would never see the stage in Brecht's lifetime. Happy End's score by Weill produced many Brecht/Weill hits like \\"Der Bilbao-Song\\" and \\"Surabaya-Jonny\\". The masterpiece of the Brecht/Weill collaborations, Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny (Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny), caused an uproar when it premiered in 1930 in Leipzig, with Nazis in the audience protesting. The Mahagonny opera would premier later in Berlin in 1931 as a triumphant sensation. Brecht spent the last years of the Weimar-era (1930‚Äì1933) in Berlin working with his \\"collective\\" on the Lehrst√ºcke. These were a group of plays driven by morals, music and Brecht's budding epic theatre. The Lehrst√ºcke often aimed at educating workers on Socialist issues. The Measures Taken (Die Massnahme) was scored by Hanns Eisler. In addition, Brecht worked on a script for a semi- documentary feature film about the human impact of mass unemployment, Kuhle Wampe (1932), which was directed by Slatan Dudow. This striking film is notable for its subversive humour, outstanding cinematography by G√ºnther Krampf, and Hanns Eisler's dynamic musical contribution. It still provides a vivid insight into Berlin during the last years of the Weimar Republic.  Nazi Germany and World War II (1933‚Äì1945)  Fearing persecution, Brecht left Nazi Germany in February 1933, just after Hitler took power. After brief spells in Prague, Zurich and Paris he and Weigel accepted an invitation from journalist and author Karin Micha√´lis to move to Denmark. The family first stayed with Karin Micha√´lis at her house on the small island of Thur√∏ close to the island of Funen. They later bought their own house in Svendborg on Funen. This house located at Skovsbo Strand 8 in Svendborg became the residence of the Brecht family for the next six years, where they often received guests including Walter Benjamin, Hanns Eisler and Ruth Berlau. During this period Brecht also travelled frequently to Copenhagen, Paris, Moscow, New York and London for various projects and collaborations. When war seemed imminent in April 1939, he moved to Stockholm, Sweden, where he remained for a year.german.wisc.edu After Hitler invaded Norway and Denmark, Brecht left Sweden for Helsinki, Finland, where he lived and waited for his visa for the United States until 3 May 1941. During this time he wrote the play Mr Puntila and his Man Matti (Herr Puntila und sein Knecht Matti) with Hella Wuolijoki, with whom he lived in . During the war years, Brecht became a prominent writer of the Exilliteratur.Exilliteratur. He expressed his opposition to the National Socialist and Fascist movements in his most famous plays: Life of Galileo, Mother Courage and Her Children, The Good Person of Szechwan, The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, The Caucasian Chalk Circle, Fear and Misery of the Third Reich, and many others. Brecht co-wrote the screenplay for the Fritz Lang-directed film Hangmen Also Die! which was loosely based on the 1942 assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, the Nazi Deputy Reich Protector of the German-occupied Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Heinrich Himmler's right- hand man in the SS, and a chief architect of the Holocaust, who was known as \\"The Hangman of Prague.\\" Hanns Eisler was nominated for an Academy Award for his musical score. The collaboration of three prominent refugees from Nazi Germany ‚Äì Lang, Brecht and Eisler ‚Äì is an example of the influence this generation of German exiles had on American culture. Hangmen Also Die! was Brecht's only script for a Hollywood film. The money he earned from writing the film enabled him to write The Visions of Simone Machard, Schweik in the Second World War and an adaptation of Webster's The Duchess of Malfi. In 1942 Brecht's reluctance to help Carola Neher, who died in a gulag prison in the USSR after being arrested during the 1936 purges, caused much controversy among Russian emigrants in the West.: \\"Stalins deutsche Opfer und die Volksfront\\", in the underground magazine Unser Wort, Nr. 4/5, October 1938, pp. 7 ff.; , Der Stalinismus und die Renegaten. Die Literatur der Exkommunisten, Stuttgart 1991, p. 163  Cold War and final years in East Germany (1945‚Äì1956)  Brecht and Weigel on the roof of the Berliner Ensemble during the International Workers' Day demonstrations in 1954 In the years of the Cold War and \\"Red Scare\\", Brecht was blacklisted by movie studio bosses and interrogated by the House Un-American Activities Committee.Brecht HUAC hearing Along with about 41 other Hollywood writers, directors, actors and producers, he was subpoenaed to appear before the HUAC in September 1947. Although he was one of 19 witnesses who declared that they would refuse to appear, Brecht eventually decided to testify. He later explained that he had followed the advice of attorneys and had not wanted to delay a planned trip to Europe. On 30 October 1947 Brecht testified that he had never been a member of the Communist Party. He made wry jokes throughout the proceedings, punctuating his inability to speak English well with continuous references to the translators present, who transformed his German statements into English ones unintelligible to himself. HUAC vice-chairman Karl Mundt thanked Brecht for his co-operation. The remaining witnesses, the so-called Hollywood Ten, refused to testify and were cited for contempt. Brecht's decision to appear before the committee led to criticism, including accusations of betrayal. The day after his testimony, on 31 October, Brecht returned to Europe. He lived in Zurich in Switzerland for a year. In February 1948 in Chur, Brecht staged an adaptation of Sophocles' Antigone, based on a translation by H√∂lderlin. It was published under the title Antigonemodell 1948, accompanied by an essay on the importance of creating a \\"non-Aristotelian\\" form of theatre. In 1949 he moved to East Berlin and established his theatre company there, the Berliner Ensemble. He retained his Austrian nationality (granted in 1950) and overseas bank accounts from which he received valuable hard currency remittances. The copyrights on his writings were held by a Swiss company. At the time he drove a pre-war DKW car‚Äîa rare luxury in the austere divided capital. Though he was never a member of the Communist Party, Brecht had been schooled in Marxism by the dissident communist Karl Korsch. Korsch's version of the Marxist dialectic influenced Brecht greatly, both his aesthetic theory and theatrical practice. Brecht received the Stalin Peace Prize in 1954. Brecht wrote very few plays in his final years in East Berlin, none of them as famous as his previous works. He dedicated himself to directing plays and developing the talents of the next generation of young directors and dramaturgs, such as Manfred Wekwerth, Benno Besson and Carl Weber. At this time he wrote some of his most famous poems, including the \\"Buckow Elegies\\". At first Brecht apparently supported the measures taken by the East German government against the uprising of 1953 in East Germany, which included the use of Soviet military force. In a letter from the day of the uprising to SED First Secretary Walter Ulbricht, Brecht wrote that: \\"History will pay its respects to the revolutionary impatience of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. The great discussion [exchange] with the masses about the speed of socialist construction will lead to a viewing and safeguarding of the socialist achievements. At this moment I must assure you of my allegiance to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.\\"Letter published in the Neues Deutschland, 21 June 1953. Graves of Helene Weigel and Bertolt Brecht in the Dorotheenstadt cemetery Brecht's subsequent commentary on those events, however, offered a very different assessment‚Äîin one of the poems in the Elegies, \\"Die L√∂sung\\" (The Solution), a disillusioned Brecht writes a few months later: > After the uprising of the 17th of June The Secretary of the Writers Union > Had leaflets distributed in the Stalinallee Stating that the people Had > forfeited the confidence of the government And could win it back only By > redoubled efforts. Would it not be easier In that case for the government To > dissolve the people And elect another?Brecht (2000b, 440). The poem was > first printed in the West-German newspaper Die Welt in 1959 and subsequently > in the Buckow Elegies in the West 1964. It was first published in the GDR in > 1969 after Helene Weigel had insisted on its inclusion in a collected > edition of Brecht's works. Brecht's involvement in agitprop and lack of clear condemnation of purges resulted in criticism from many contemporaries who became disillusioned in communism earlier. Fritz Raddatz who knew Brecht for a long time described his attitude as \\"broken\\", \\"escaping the problem of Stalinism\\", ignoring his friends being murdered in the USSR, keeping silence during show trials such as Sl√°nsk√Ω trial.  Death  Brecht died on 14 August 1956 of a heart attack at the age of 58. He is buried in the Dorotheenstadt Cemetery on Chausseestra√üe in the Mitte neighbourhood of Berlin, overlooked by the residence he shared with Helene Weigel. According to Stephen Parker, who reviewed Brecht's writings and unpublished medical records, Brecht contracted rheumatic fever as a child, which led to an enlarged heart, followed by lifelong chronic heart failure and Sydenham's chorea. A report of a radiograph taken of Brecht in 1951 describes a badly diseased heart, enlarged to the left with a protruding aortic knob and with seriously impaired pumping. Brecht's colleagues described him as being very nervous, and sometimes shaking his head or moving his hands erratically. This can be reasonably attributed to Sydenham's chorea, which is also associated with emotional lability, personality changes, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and hyperactivity, which matched Brecht's behavior. \\"What is remarkable,\\" wrote Parker, \\"is his capacity to turn abject physical weakness into peerless artistic strength, arrhythmia into the rhythms of poetry, chorea into the choreography of drama.\\"  Theory and practice of theatre  Statue of Brecht outside the Berliner Ensemble's theatre in Berlin Brecht developed the combined theory and practice of his \\"Epic theatre\\" by synthesizing and extending the experiments of Erwin Piscator and Vsevolod Meyerhold to explore the theatre as a forum for political ideas and the creation of a critical aesthetics of dialectical materialism. Epic Theatre proposed that a play should not cause the spectator to identify emotionally with the characters or action before him or her, but should instead provoke rational self-reflection and a critical view of the action on the stage. Brecht thought that the experience of a climactic catharsis of emotion left an audience complacent. Instead, he wanted his audiences to adopt a critical perspective in order to recognise social injustice and exploitation and to be moved to go forth from the theatre and effect change in the world outside. For this purpose, Brecht employed the use of techniques that remind the spectator that the play is a representation of reality and not reality itself. By highlighting the constructed nature of the theatrical event, Brecht hoped to communicate that the audience's reality was equally constructed and, as such, was changeable. Brecht's modernist concern with drama-as-a-medium led to his refinement of the \\"epic form\\" of the drama. This dramatic form is related to similar modernist innovations in other arts, including the strategy of divergent chapters in James Joyce's novel Ulysses, Sergei Eisenstein's evolution of a constructivist \\"montage\\" in the cinema, and Picasso's introduction of cubist \\"collage\\" in the visual arts.On these relationships, see \\"autonomization\\" in Jameson (1998, 43‚Äì58) and \\"non-organic work of art\\" in B√ºrger (1984, 87‚Äì92). Willett observes: \\"With Brecht the same montage technique spread to the drama, where the old Procrustean plot yielded to a more \\"epic\\" form of narrative better able to cope with wide-ranging modern socio-economic themes. That, at least, was how Brecht theoretically justified his choice of form, and from about 1929 on he began to interpret its penchant for \\"contradictions\\", much as had Sergei Eisenstein, in terms of the dialectic. It is fairly clear that in Brecht's case the practice came before the theory, for his actual composition of a play, with its switching around of scenes and characters, even the physical cutting up and sticking together of the typescript, shows that montage was the structural technique most natural to him. Like Jaroslav Ha≈°ek and Joyce he had not learnt this scissors-and- paste method from the Soviet cinema but picked it out of the air\\" (1978, 110). One of Brecht's most important principles was what he called the Verfremdungseffekt (translated as \\"defamiliarization effect\\", \\"distancing effect\\", or \\"estrangement effect\\", and often mistranslated as \\"alienation effect\\").Brooker (1994, 193). Brooker writes that \\"the term 'alienation' is an inadequate and even misleading translation of Brecht's Verfremdung. The terms 'de-familiarisation' or 'estrangement', when understood as more than purely formal devices, give a more accurate sense of Brecht's intentions. A better term still would be 'de-alienation'\\". This involved, Brecht wrote, \\"stripping the event of its self-evident, familiar, obvious quality and creating a sense of astonishment and curiosity about them\\".Brecht, quoted by Brooker (1994, 191). To this end, Brecht employed techniques such as the actor's direct address to the audience, harsh and bright stage lighting, the use of songs to interrupt the action, explanatory placards, the transposition of text to the third person or past tense in rehearsals, and speaking the stage directions out loud. In contrast to many other avant-garde approaches, however, Brecht had no desire to destroy art as an institution; rather, he hoped to \\"re- function\\" the theatre to a new social use. In this regard he was a vital participant in the aesthetic debates of his era‚Äîparticularly over the \\"high art/popular culture\\" dichotomy‚Äîvying with the likes of Theodor W. Adorno, Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs, Ernst Bloch, and developing a close friendship with Walter Benjamin. Brechtian theatre articulated popular themes and forms with avant- garde formal experimentation to create a modernist realism that stood in sharp contrast both to its psychological and socialist varieties. \\"Brecht's work is the most important and original in European drama since Ibsen and Strindberg,\\" Raymond Williams argues, while Peter B√ºrger dubs him \\"the most important materialist writer of our time.\\"The quotation from Raymond Williams is on page 277 of his book (1993) and that from Peter B√ºrger on page 88 of his (1984). Brecht was also influenced by Chinese theatre, and used its aesthetic as an argument for Verfremdungseffekt. Brecht believed, \\"Traditional Chinese acting also knows the alienation [sic] effect, and applies it most subtly.\\"Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic\\" Translated and Edited by John Willett, page 91... The [Chinese] performer portrays incidents of utmost passion, but without his delivery becoming heated.\\"\\"Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic\\" Translated and Edited by John Willett, page 92 Brecht attended a Chinese opera performance and was introduced to the famous Chinese opera performer Mei Lanfang in 1935. However, Brecht was sure to distinguish between Epic and Chinese theatre. He recognized that the Chinese style was not a \\"transportable piece of technique,\\"\\"Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic\\" Translated and Edited by John Willett, page 95 and that Epic theatre sought to historicize and address social and political issues.\\"Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic\\" Translated and Edited by John Willett, page 96 Brecht used his poetry to criticize European culture, including Nazis, and the German bourgeoisie. Brecht's poetry is marked by the effects of the First and Second World Wars. Throughout his theatric production, poems are incorporated into this plays with music. In 1951, Brecht issued a recantation of his apparent suppression of poetry in his plays with a note titled On Poetry and Virtuosity. He writes: > We shall not need to speak of a play's poetry ... something that seemed > relatively unimportant in the immediate past. It seemed not only > unimportant, but misleading, and the reason was not that the poetic element > had been sufficiently developed and observed, but that reality had been > tampered with in its name ... we had to speak of a truth as distinct from > poetry ... we have given up examining works of art from their poetic or > artistic aspect, and got satisfaction from theatrical works that have no > sort of poetic appeal ... Such works and performances may have some effect, > but it can hardly be a profound one, not even politically. For it is a > peculiarity of the theatrical medium that it communicates awarenesses and > impulses in the form of pleasure: the depth of the pleasure and the impulse > will correspond to the depth of the pleasure. Brecht's most influential poetry is featured in his Manual of Piety (Devotions), establishing him as a noted poet.  Legacy  Brecht's widow, the actress Helene Weigel, continued to manage the Berliner Ensemble until her death in 1971; it was primarily devoted to performing Brecht's plays. Besides being an influential dramatist and poet, some scholars have stressed the significance of Brecht's original contributions in political and social philosophy. Brecht's collaborations with Kurt Weill have had some influence in rock music. The \\"Alabama Song\\" for example, originally published as a poem in Brecht's Hauspostille (1927) and set to music by Weill in Mahagonny, has been recorded by The Doors, on their self-titled debut album, as well as by David Bowie and various other bands and performers since the 1960s. Brecht's son, Stefan Brecht, became a poet and theatre critic interested in New York's avant-garde theatre. Brecht's plays were a focus of the Schauspiel Frankfurt when Harry Buckwitz was general manager, including the world premiere of Die Gesichte der Simone Machard in 1957.  Brecht in fiction, drama and film  * In the 1930 novel Success, Brecht's mentor Lion Feuchtwanger immortalized Brecht as the character Kaspar Pr√∂ckl. * In the G√ºnter Grass play The Plebeians Rehearse the Uprising (1966), Brecht appears as \\"The Boss\\", rehearsing his version of Shakespeare's Coriolanus against the background of worker unrest in East Berlin in 1953. * Cuban songwriter Silvio Rodr√≠guez started his song Sue√±o con serpientes from the album D√≠as y flores (1975) with a phrase of Brecht. * Brecht appears as a character in Christopher Hampton's play Tales from Hollywood, first produced in 1982, dealing with German expatriates in Hollywood at the time of the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings on supposed Communist infiltration of the motion picture industry and the beginning of the Hollywood blacklist. * In Peter Weiss's monumental novel of 1981 Die √Ñsthetik des Widerstands (The Aesthetics of Resistance) Brecht is a teacher for the narrator who aspires to become a writer. * In the 1999 film Cradle Will Rock Brecht appears as an inspiration to Marc Blitzstein. * The 2000 German film Abschied ‚Äì Brechts letzter Sommer (The Farewell), directed by Jan Sch√ºtte, depicts Brecht (Josef Bierbichler) shortly before his death, attended to by Helene Weigel (Monica Bleibtreu) and two former lovers. * In the 2006 film The Lives of Others, a Stasi agent played by Ulrich M√ºhe is partially inspired to save a playwright he has been spying on by reading a book of Brecht poetry that he had stolen from the artist's apartment.

Eric Dickens (Dalkey Archive Press, 2009) * In Robert Cohen's historical novel Exil der frechen Frauen (2009) Brecht is a major character. * The 2013 film Witness 11 draws upon historical events exploring the justice-thirsty courtroom through the eyes of Brecht as he is called to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee. * In the 2013 Italian film Viva la libert√† the Brecht poem To a Waverer forms the text for an important and moving speech. * In the 2014 novel Leaving Berlin by Joseph Kanon, Brecht appears as a cynical returnee to Soviet Berlin, lauded by the authorities as a symbol of communist German culture and willing to ignore moral issues to pursue his art.  Collaborators and associates  Collective and collaborative working methods were inherent to Brecht's approach, as Fredric Jameson (among others) stresses. Jameson describes the creator of the work not as Brecht the individual, but rather as 'Brecht': a collective subject that \\"certainly seemed to have a distinctive style (the one we now call 'Brechtian') but was no longer personal in the bourgeois or individualistic sense.\\" During the course of his career, Brecht sustained many long-lasting creative relationships with other writers, composers, scenographers, directors, dramaturgs and actors; the list includes: Elisabeth Hauptmann, Margarete Steffin, Ruth Berlau, Slatan Dudow, Kurt Weill, Hanns Eisler, Paul Dessau, Caspar Neher, Teo Otto, Karl von Appen, Ernst Busch, Lotte Lenya, Peter Lorre, Therese Giehse, Angelika Hurwicz, Carola Neher and Helene Weigel herself. This is \\"theatre as collective experiment [...] as something radically different from theatre as expression or as experience.\\"Jameson (1998, 10‚Äì11). See also the discussions of Brecht's collaborative relationships in the essays collected in Thomson and Sacks (1994). John Fuegi's take on Brecht's collaborations, detailed in Brecht & Co. (New York: Grove, 1994; also known as The Life and Lies of Bertolt Brecht) and summarized in his contribution to Thomson and Sacks (1994, 104‚Äì116), offers a particularly negative perspective; Jameson comments \\"his book will remain a fundamental document for future students of the ideological confusions of Western intellectuals during the immediate post-Cold War years\\" (1998, 31); Olga Taxidou offers a critical account of Fuegi's project from a feminist perspective in \\"Crude Thinking: John Fuegi and Recent Brecht Criticism\\" in New Theatre Quarterly XI.44 (Nov. 1995), pp. 381‚Äì384.

The second object cannot be seen, but based on its calculated mass of , it is too massive to be a neutron star and must therefore be a stellar-mass black hole. At a distance of about roughly away, this would make A0620-00 one of the nearest known black holes to the Solar System, closer than GRO J1655-40. The two objects orbit each other every 7.75 hours. A0620-00 has undergone two X-ray outbreaks. The first one was in 1917. The second time, in 1975, the burst was detected by the Ariel 5 satellite.

The black hole in A0620-00 pulls matter from the K-type star into an accretion disk. The accretion disk emits significant amounts of visible light and X-rays. Because the K-type star has been pulled into an ellipsoidal shape, the amount of surface area visible, and thus the apparent brightness, changes from the Earth's perspective.

The broadcast will travel the 3,457-light-year distance at the speed of light and will arrive in the year 5475; this will be the first-ever human interaction with a currently known black hole. 1A 0620-00 was chosen for this broadcast as it was the closest known black hole to Earth at the time.

Early life and career Jim Flower was educated at Blundell's School in Tiverton before joining the Royal Navy in 1941. He served during the war in the cruiser and the battleship and from 1948 in the cruiser . Liverpool was followed by a five-year stint on the staff of the Engineer-in-Chief of the Fleet. This led to a first ‚Äúcharge job‚Äù in 1955 as the engineer officer of the frigate , the first ship of the Type 12 anti-submarine frigates (Whitby-class frigates). Flower was promoted to commander in 1957 and joined the recently formed nuclear propulsion development team under the Rear-Admiral Nuclear Propulsion, where he worked on the development of , Britain's first nuclear submarine. From 1961 Flower spent two years at sea as the engineer officer of a frigate squadron, followed by tours at Cammell Laird's shipbuilders and at the Admiralty. After promotion to captain, he was the Western Fleet's senior engineering staff officer and, from 1970, commanded the nuclear reactor testing and training establishment at Dounreay before spending four years based at the Ministry of Defence in Bath as Deputy Director (Design) for marine engineering with the Director-General (Ships). Perhaps more than any other single person, he was responsible for the success of the ‚Äúmarinised‚Äù gas turbine programme, initially based on the Type 14 (Blackwood class) frigate which was rebuilt as a gas turbine-driven ship and used as a test-bed to overcome the host of design difficulties that confront aero engines when translated to a hostile shipborne environment. This programme placed the Royal Navy well ahead of other nations and has been compared in importance to the introduction of the steam turbine. Within a few years, all major Royal Navy new construction, including aircraft carriers, were gas turbine-driven. Flower was promoted to rear-admiral in 1975 and appointed Flag Officer and Port Admiral at Portsmouth. He returned to Bath for his final two postings as Director of Engineering (Ships) and Director of Post Design. There he was very much to the fore in promoting the interests of Rolls-Royce in Japan, where British experience with overall ‚Äúmarinised‚Äù installations, particularly the fuel-efficient Olympus-Tyne combination, produced an edge over the competition. This led to Japan's Maritime Self- Defense Force becoming a better customer than the Royal Navy. Flower was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath on his retirement in 1980.

Peterson spent several years on the County Committee, only recently leaving that position. Peterson is also a former president of the Hunterdon County Young Republicans. Peterson was elected a Hunterdon County freeholder in 2005, running on a platform of fiscal conservatism, farmland preservation, and open government.  New Jersey Assembly  Before being selected as Assemblyman in December 2009, Peterson ran in a special convention to replace Assemblywoman Marcia A. Karrow who had been appointed to the State Senate. In the first ballot taken of Republican committee persons of the 23rd district, Warren County Freeholder John DiMaio received 129 votes (short of a majority), Peterson 104, and fellow Hunterdon County Freeholder Matt Holt 56. In the second ballot, DiMaio defeated Peterson 153-141. In 2009, Republican Assemblyman Michael J. Doherty declined to seek re-election to his Assembly seat and instead challenged State Senator Marcia A. Karrow in the Republican primary for the special election in the 23rd district. Incumbent DiMaio, Peterson, and Doherty‚Äôs chief of staff, Edward Smith, ran for the Republican nomination to the Assembly seats. DiMaio received the most votes in the June 2009 Republican primary election, 11,888 votes (34.2% of the total vote) while Peterson narrowly defeated Smith by 52 votes: 11,439‚Äì11,387 (33.0% to 32.8%). DiMaio and Peterson won easily in the heavily Republican 23rd district in November's general election. As Doherty was sworn in as State Senator on November 23, 2009, a convention of Republican county committee members gathered to name a successor for the vacancy. Peterson was selected by the county committee members on December 6, 2009 and sworn into office the following day.

Native American legend The story of a monster in Flathead Lake originates in a Kutenai traditional legend. According to the story, long ago, the first native tribe in the area lived on an island in the middle of the lake. One winter while crossing the frozen lake to move camp, two girls saw antlers approximately two feet in length protruding through the frozen ice. Thinking the antlers belonged to some animal, the girls decided to chop them off and take them. They used sharp-edged rocks to cut through the ice when the antlers suddenly started shaking, the ice around them split open, and the head of a monster appeared through the ice shaking its giant antlers. The girls used their special powers to transform into a ball and a buckskin target to escape the monster, but half of the tribe drowned in the lake, which is said to be the reason why there are so few Kutenai people. The narrative holds that the Kutenai never strayed far from the lakeshore after that, and white settlers later reported occasionally seeing the monster.Ella Elizabeth Clark. Indian Legends from the Northern Rockies. University of Oklahoma Press; 1988. . p. 149‚Äì. Local stories According to retired newspaper editor Paul Fugleberg, local tales of the Flathead Lake Monster go back more than 100 years. It was supposedly first reported in 1889 by Captain James C. Kerr of the lake steamboat the U.S. Grant who claimed he and his 100 passengers saw an unusually large whale-like object in the water. According to the story, one of the passengers on the steamer shot at the creature and sent it diving for safety. Fugleberg notes that local residents have named the purported lake monster \\"Flessie\\", inspired by Loch Ness \\"Nessie\\". Contemporary reports of sightings of \\"Flessie\\" by local residents and visitors average between one and two each year, however, in 1993 alone, there were about thirteen reports. The monster is usually described as a large eel-shaped creature, round with a wavy body like a snake, twenty to forty feet long, having brownish to blue-black skin and grayish-black eyes. It has often been described as looking like a whale or a giant sturgeon. According to Fugleberg, ‚ÄúWhen I was editor of the Flathead Courier at Polson, author Dorothy M. Johnson, then secretary of the Montana Press Association, advised me not to treat sighting reports lightly in newspaper and magazine articles. She said, ‚ÄòI don't think the monster should be done with tongue in cheek. You have eyewitness accounts by people who were scared and didn't think it was funny.‚Äù One local story that received much publicity described how a 3-year-old boy apparently fell into the lake, and when asked how he had extracted himself, told his mother ‚ÄúThe Flathead monster lifted me up\\".Edward Lawrence. Montana Myths and Legends: The True Stories behind History‚Äôs Mysteries. Rowman & Littlefield; 5 June 2016. . Fugleberg wrote that claimed sightings of the monster have been blamed on \\"hyperactive imaginations, playful pranks, natural phenomena such as wave action, shadows, lighting effects, logs and a number of animals, including bears, horses, deer, elk, dogs, a dead monkey, a loose circus seal and even an escaped buffalo\\". In the 1950s, a significant cash reward was offered by Big Fish Unlimited to anyone who could catch what was termed the \\"superfish\\" of Flathead Lake. A man named C. Leslie Griffith was reported to have caught a 7-foot, 6-inch, 181-pound, 1-ounce white sturgeon, now displayed at the Polson-Flathead Historical Museum.

Foxx reformed the city's public safety pay plan and developed a demand-driven approach to workforce development that has become a national model. Foxx also announced the creation of more than 4,000 new jobs. He hosted a series of town hall meetings with unemployed workers, pushed for changes to the city's small business loan program, and pressed White House officials for economic recovery spending measures.

It provides a \\"world-wide, royalty-free, non- exclusive licence to use, modify, and distribute the datasets in all current and future media and formats for any lawful purpose\\" with proper credit.Open Government Licence - Toronto Four principles are \\"transparency, participation, accountability, and accessibility.\\" History Toronto Open Data website was launched at the Toronto Innovation Showcase forum on November 2, 2009. To meet the demand and expectations, and to increase the accessibility, the new Open Data Portal was launched in May 2018. During the migration process, the former portal was still recommended until all datasets were ready on the new portal. On February 25, 2019, Open Data Toronto announced the movement had been completed. Key features of the new Open Data Portal include enhanced accessibility, dataset previews, developer APIs for all open datasets, visualizations, and more. Datasets As of March 2016, data provided in the City of Toronto's open data catalogue, includes over 200 data sets such as Festivals and Events, Licensed Child Care Centers, Priority Investment Neighbourhoods, Wellbeing Neighbourhood index and transportation data. The former Open Data Portal stopped being updated on January 15, 2018, with 292 datasets. As of March 2019, 295 datasets are available on the new Open Data Portal, and the portal is being updated continuously. Comparable Initiatives Many cities have launched open data initiatives. Issues As of 2010, Toronto Open Data required a click-through license for any reuse, which made it unsuitable for producing physical products (such as haptic maps for the blind). Toronto adopted the Pan Canada Open Government licence in August 2013. The new licence clarified much confusion on behalf of users as to attribution and rights to use data. Other challenges in Toronto Open Data including a lack of staff's support, and stakeholders' opposition.  Open Data Master Program  Toronto's City Council approved Toronto's Open Data Master Plan in January 2018. The plan provides a direction for Toronto's Open Data activities until 2022 and helps the city to take a lead on Open Data. \\"Co-develop with the public; release datasets that help solve civic issues; explore opportunities to improve City efficiency, and embrace inclusivity\\" were consistent throughout the plan design. The International Open Data Charter (ODC) guides the Open Data Master Program in four aspects: Foundation (data's accessibility, and quality); Integration (government, resource, team and public); Connection (market, talent, and other communities); and Activation (data use and open data awareness).

Famous for its colourful history and the hosting of the Tournament of Roses Parade since 1890, and the annual Rose Bowl football game since 1902. Pasadena was founded in 1874 and incorporated in 1886. Indigenous culture and colonization At the time of European contact, the inhabitants of Pasadena and surrounding areas were members of the Native American Indians Hahamog-na tribe, a branch of the Tongva Nation. They spoke the Tongva language (part of the Uto-Aztecan languages group) that lived in the Los Angeles Basin for thousands of years. Tongva dwellings lined the Arroyo Seco (Los Angeles County) in present-day Pasadena and south to where it joins the Los Angeles River and along other natural waterways in the city. They lived in thatched, dome-shape lodges. For food, they lived on a diet of acorn meal, seeds and herbs, venison, and other small animals. They traded for ocean fish with the coastal Tongva. They made cooking vessels from steatite soapstone from Catalina Island. The oldest transportation route still in existence in Pasadena is the old Tongva foot trail, also known as the Gabrielino Trail, that goes along the west side of the Rose Bowl and up the Arroyo Seco past the Jet Propulsion Laboratory into the San Gabriel Mountains. That trail has been in continuous use for thousands of years. An arm of the trail is also still in use up what is now called Salvia Canyon. When the Spanish occupied the Los Angeles Basin they built the San Gabriel Mission and renamed the local Tongva people \\"Gabrielino Indians,\\" after the name of the mission. Today, several bands of Tongva people live in the Los Angeles area.Gabrieleno/Tongva of San Gabriel Early development Pasadena is a part of the original Mexican land grant originally given over from Spain to Mexico, named Rancho del Rincon de San Pascual, so named because it was deeded on Easter Sunday to Eulalia Perez de Guill√©n Marin√© of Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel. The Rancho comprised the lands of today's communities of Pasadena, Altadena and South Pasadena. Prior to the annexation of California in 1848, the last of the Mexican owners was Manuel Garfias who retained title to the property after statehood in 1850. Garfias sold sections of the property to the first Anglo settlers to come into the area: Benjamin Eaton, the father of Fred Eaton, and Dr. S. Griffin. Much of the property was purchased by Benjamin Wilson who established his Lake Vineyard property in the vicinity. Wilson, known as Don Benito to the local Indians, was also owner of the Rancho Jurupa (Riverside, California) and mayor of Los Angeles. He is the grandfather of WWII General George S. Patton, Jr. and had Mount Wilson named for him. Pasadena, 1876. In 1873, Wilson was visited by one Dr. Daniel M. Berry of Indiana who was looking for a place in the country that could offer better climate to his patients, most of whom suffered from tuberculosis . Berry was an asthmatic and claimed that he had his best three nights sleep at Rancho San Pascual. To keep the find a secret, Berry code-named the area \\"Muscat\\" after the grape that Wilson grew. To raise funds to bring the company of people to San Pascual, Berry formed the Southern California Orange and Citrus Growers Association for which he sold stock. The newcomers were able to purchase a large portion of the property along the Arroyo Seco and on January 31, 1874, they incorporated the Indiana Colony. As a gesture of good will, Wilson added of then useless highland property, part of which would become Altadena. At the time, the Indiana Colony was a narrow strip of land between the Arroyo Seco and Fair Oaks Avenue. On the other side of the street was Wilson's Lake Vineyard development. After more than a decade of parallel development on both sides, the two settlements merged into the City of Pasadena. Origin of name Colorado Blvd., 1890. Prior to the 1890s, the mail was delivered to the Indiana Colony via Los Angeles. In an attempt to obtain their own post office, the Colony needed to change its name to something the Postmaster General considered appropriate. To this end the town fathers put three names up to a vote. The first was \\"Indianola,\\" the second was \\"Granada,\\" in keeping with the area's Spanish heritage. The third name was proposed by Dr. Thomas Elliott, who had contacted a missionary friend in Michigan who had worked with the Minnesota Chippewa Native Americans, although the Chippewa language had no ties to Southern California. He submitted four names for translation: \\"Crown of the Valley,\\" \\"Key of the Valley,\\" \\"Valley of the Valley,\\" and \\"Hill of the Valley.\\" All of the translations ended in \\"pa-sa-de-na,\\" meaning \\"of the valley.\\"George R. Stewart, Names on the Land (1945). Due to its euphonious nature, Pasadena was chosen, put to a vote, and accepted, though maps from the Wheeler Survey of 1878 show the names \\"Indiana Colony\\" and \\"Pasadena\\" in the same location. In March 1886, Pasadena became the second incorporated municipality, after the city of Los Angeles, in Los Angeles County. In 1892, John H. Burnett of Galveston, Texas, visited Pasadena. After returning home, Burnett plotted a town along two bayous, with its similar lush vegetation, naming it Pasadena, after the California city. Pasadena is one of two large cities in the area that shares its name with another large American city. (See Glendale, California and Glendale, Arizona) Pasadena as a resort town (1886‚Äì1941) The popularity of the region drew people from across the country, and Pasadena eventually became a stop on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, which led to an explosion in growth. From the real estate boom of the 1880s until the Great Depression, as great tourist hotels were developed in the city, Pasadena became a winter resort for wealthy Easterners, spurring the development of new neighborhoods and business districts, and increased road and transit connections with Los Angeles, culminating with the opening of the Arroyo Seco Parkway, California's first freeway. By 1940, Pasadena had become the eighth largest city in California and was considered by many to be a twin city to Los Angeles. The first of the great hotels to be established in Pasadena was the Raymond (1886) atop Bacon Hill, renamed Raymond Hill after construction. The original Mansard Victorian 200 room facility burned down on Easter morning of 1895 and was not rebuilt until 1903. It was razed during the Great Depression to make way for residential development. The Maryland Hotel existed from the early 1900s and was demolished in 1934. (Note: On April 27, 1935, Mary Stubbs Warner sailed from New York City to San Francisco and listed her home as The Maryland Hotel in Pasadena, California. This demolition date should be verified.) The world-famous Mount Lowe Railway and associated mountain hotels shut down four years later due to fire damage. Three hotel structures have survived, the Green Hotel (a co-op since 1926), the Vista Del Arroyo (now used as a Federal courthouse), and a residential tower of the Maryland at 80 North Euclid Avenue (a co-op since 1953).Thomas D. Carpenter, Pasadena: Resort Hotels and Paradise, March Sheldon Publishing (Azusa, California), 1984, pp. 147‚Äì169. Hotel Green Hotel Green, 1900. The Hotel Green started construction on South Raymond Avenue at Kansas Street in 1887 by Edward C. Webster who was unable to finish it. Colonel George Gill Green, a wealthy patent medicine distributor from New Jersey, finished the six story edifice in 1888. In 1898 he finished construction on a second building on the west side of Raymond and connected the two buildings with a bridge and a tunnel. The patrons arrived by train at the adjacent station. In 1902, the hotel was extended to the P.G. Wooster building at the corner of Fair Oaks Avenue and Green Street. In 1924, the hotel became a private residence. The original 1888 structure was later razed to its first story and sold. It is currently occupied by STATS Floral Supply. In 1970, the two wings of the remaining hotel were partitioned creating two separate buildings. The 1898 section remained the private residence now called the Castle Green. The 1902 portion was taken over by the government's HUD program for senior residents and disabled persons, and is called the Green Hotel. In 1929, Kansas Street was widened and renamed Green Street. Vista del Arroyo The Vista Del Arroyo Hotel on Grand Avenue, commandeered by the Navy as a hospital, McCormack General Hospital, during World War II. It now houses the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is located in the fully restored former Vista del Arroyo Hotel. The hotel was then owned by the Royce Family who also owned the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, and the Huntington Hotel.militarymuseum.org, McCormack General Hospital Grand Avenue Grand Avenue is a historic, estate lined street. Grand Avenue was, at different times, home to Jared Torrance, the founder of the City of Torrance, J.B. Van Nuys, the founder of the City of Van Nuys, the Cox family, of communications and newspaper fame, the Spalding family, sporting goods titans, and Howard Huntington, heir to Henry Huntington. Transportation Trains Pasadena was served by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway at the Santa Fe Depot in downtown when the Second District was opened in 1887. In 1925, the historical and traditionally-styled station in Pasadena was opened. Originally, the Second District was an invaluable line; it served manufacturing and agricultural businesses throughout the entire San Gabriel Valley. Unfortunately, the longer trains had great difficulty climbing the precipitous 2.2% grade at Arroyo Seco, between Pasadena and Los Angeles. Additional locomotives were often necessary, causing a more costly and less efficient operation. The still-used Third District opened in 1888, just a year after the Second District, and rapidly took over most of longer freight trains more efficaciously. The Second District and the Pasadena Depot became well known by the many transcontinental passenger trains that it served. Historically, up to 26 passenger trains went through Pasadena every day. In order to avoid the media in Los Angeles, many celebrities chose to use Pasadena as their main train station, bringing to it an ambience and legacy of the glamour of old Hollywood. Craftsman era (1890s‚Äì1930s) The American Craftsman era in art and design is exceptionally well represented in Pasadena. In architecture Greene and Greene, the Green Brothers firm, developed the style with many residences still existing. Two examples of their Ultimate bungalow versions are the masterpiece Gamble House (public tours),The Gamble House by Greene & Greene in Pasadena, California: official website and the Robert R. Blacker House (private). Both are designated California Historical Landmarks and on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Busch Gardens Adolphus Busch was the co-founder of Anheuser-Busch, brewer of Budweiser beer. The wealthy easterner took full advantage of the area's mild climate and established the first of a series of Busch Gardens here. The first Busch Gardens opened in 1905 and closed to the public in 1937. During its time, it was one of the major tourist attractions in the Los Angeles area and offered many unique gardens and fairyland landscapes and structures. It was used as a location for several Hollywood motion pictures. After 1937 and the Second World War, much of the land was developed for homes. When Busch died at his Pasadena estate, his wife generously offered the home to the City of Pasadena, an offer the city inexplicably refused. Close inspection of the location can still reveal many of the original river rock walls and structures of the gardens.BuschGardens World War II and aftermath (1941‚Äì1969) Downtown Pasadena in 1945. The Second World War proved to be a boom to Pasadena as Southern California became a major staging area for the Pacific War. High tech manufacturing and scientific companies made the city their home, a trend which continued in the decades following the war, notably with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Tetra Tech and Ameron International. In the 1950s, Pasadena saw a steady influx of people from the Southern United States, especially African-Americans from Texas and Louisiana. Pasadena also began hosting a large immigrant community, particularly from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Armenia. Pasadena since 1970 The American Academy of Dramatic Arts founded in 1884 in New York, opened its Pasadena campus in 1974. However, in 2001 the conservatory moved from Pasadena to Hollywood. Training actors for the stage in a two-year program, the conservatory was the first school in the United States to offer professional education in the field of acting. Point Loma Nazarene University was located in Pasadena for many years before moving to San Diego County, and held both the names of Pasadena University and Pasadena College. In 1969, the Pasadena Unified School District was desegregated, though the issue would continue to be fought in court for a decade. A year later, the 210 Freeway was built along a newly chosen route. The freeway's construction was controversial, as it caused the demolition of over a thousand homes, many historic, and many claimed that the route was designed to cut off the city's less wealthy neighborhoods. The situation did not improve. Downtown Pasadena became dangerous in some parts and deserted in others, and incidences of murder and arson skyrocketed. Old Pasadena faced destruction as plans for new high-rise developments were drawn up, though they were mostly stopped by increasingly active preservation advocates. Pasadena suffered demographically as many residents decamped for the nearby suburbs or the Inland Empire, causing an overall decrease in population. Despite these setbacks, many local artists and hipsters moved in to take advantage of low property values. Their legacy can be seen today in the Doo Dah Parade which began in 1976. The 1970s also saw the meteoric rise of gang violence in Pasadena, a trend which culminated with the 1993 Halloween Massacre, wherein three teenagers were murdered by members of the Bloods and three more were wounded. This led the Pasadena Police Department to crack down far more heavily on gang activity, which receded in the mid-1990s. In the early 2000s, several civic beautification campaigns began in earnest and many traditionally impoverished neighborhoods began gentrifying. The 2003 opening of the Los Angeles County Metro's Gold Line reopened Pasadena for rail rapid transit for the first time since 1951, and high-density condominiums began to pop up in the major business districts, leading to a major population increase. However, Pasadena's development has stalled due to the late 2000s Recession, although much needed Seismic retrofitting was completed on the City Hall building in summer 2007. It was closed in July 2004 because of safety concerns and construction began in March 2005.

McGregor is an American author, journalist and businessman who has lived in China for more than 25 years. He is one of the most recognized analysts and writers on business in China. McGregor is chairman of APCO Worldwide, Greater China and a member of the firm‚Äôs international advisory council. A professional speaker who specializes in China's business, politics and society, he regularly appears in the media to discuss China-related topics. He is the author of the books No Ancient Wisdom, No Followers: The Challenges of Chinese Authoritarian Capitalism (Prospecta Press, 2012) and One Billion Customers: Lessons from the Front Lines of Doing Business in China (Simon & Schuster, 2005).\\"The Art of the Chinese Deal\\", Business Week, 11-21-2005 He also covered China's indigenous innovation policies in the report \\"China's Drive for Indigenous Innovation: A Web of Industrial Policies\\" in 2010. He is the former CEO of Dow Jones & Company in China and Wall Street Journal bureau chief in China and Taiwan. Early life James McGregor was born September 18, 1953 in Duluth, Minnesota. He is one of nine children. After he graduated from high school in 1971, McGregor enlisted as a foot- soldier in the US Army. He was promptly sent to Vietnam where he was wounded by a North Vietnamese IED while on combat patrol and was awarded a Bronze Star and The Purple Heart. According to reports of the incident, the booby-trap was actually triggered by a bomb-detecting dog who apparently was more agile than McGregor and survived the detonation unharmed. His experience in Vietnam sparked his interest in Asia and led to him becoming a journalist. Career After returning from Vietnam, McGregor graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in journalism, and began his career as a police reporter in Los Angeles for Copley Newspapers. In 1985, while he was covering Capitol Hill for Knight Ridder Newspapers, he took a 6-week backpacking trip through China to explore whether to focus his journalism career on China. Following his trip, he began taking Mandarin lessons. He then convinced his wife Catherine Grady McGregor that Taiwan was very similar to Hawaii and they sold most of their possessions and moved to Taipei with two suitcases each in 1987. Their relationship survived McGregor's Taiwan \\"Hawaiian analogy\\" by virtue of his proven record of maintaining a cool head under fire and his steadfast repetition that all he really was trying to say is they were both places that were indeed islands surrounded by ocean. From 1987 to 1990 McGregor served as The Wall Street Journal's bureau chief in Taiwan, and from 1990 to 1994 as the paper‚Äôs bureau chief in Mainland China. From 1994 to 2000, McGregor was chief executive of Dow Jones & Company in China, and he also became a vice-president in the Dow Jones International Group. After leaving Dow Jones, McGregor was China managing partner for GIV Venture Partners, a $140 million venture capital fund specializing in the Chinese Internet and technology outsourcing. In 1996, McGregor was elected as chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. He also served for a decade as a governor of that organization. In 2005, McGregor published the book One Billion Customers: Lessons from the Front Lines of Doing Business in China. The book has been published in seven languages. McGregor is a member of the Atlantic Council; Council on Foreign Relations; National Committee on US-China Relations; Global Council of the Asia Society; and serves on a variety of China-related advisory boards, including the US-China Education Trust.

The hotel was originally built by the Canadian Northern Railway and was operated as a CN Hotel until 1955. The hotel was sold and now operates as an independent. Home - Prince Arthur Waterfront Hotel & Suites - Thunder Bay  History  In 1908, while travelling to Winnipeg, John James Carrick, Sir William Mackenzie and Sir Donald Mann were playing poker in a private car. In the wee morning hours, Carrick told the other two men that Port Arthur needed a good hotel and the Canadian Northern Railway should build one and even had a perfect location for it (the existing one). In a plebiscite taken at the end of April 1909, the citizens of Port Arthur endorsed the transfer of city land to the C.N.R. on which to build a grand new hotel. In 1910, construction began with Toronto firm Imperial Construction acting as general contractors. They delegated the work to local tradesmen and sourced materials locally: the cut stone supplied by Stanworth-Martin Company of Port Arthur and brick from the furnaces of the Twin City Sand Company. The six-storey hotel was made almost entirely of concrete and marble including walls, ceilings and floors, with very little wood, to ensure it was fireproof. Commissioned artwork was hung throughout the hotel, as well as commissioned murals were painted in the rotunda depicting the building of the C.N.R. into the city. In total, it cost $850,000 to build the hotel, a value of $14.5 million in 2018! The choice Prince Arthur for the name of the hotel was fortuitous for, when on January 14, 1911, it was announced that Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, would become Canada's next Governor General. The newly- minted Governor General visited Port Arthur in August 1912. With permission, his family crest, a British lion above a ducal coronet, was incorporated with the C.N.R. monogram and used on the hotel's chairs and dishes. On March 14, 1911, the brand-new Prince Arthur Hotel had its grand opening dinner event where over 100 selected guests sat down to a superb 18-course meal of classical French cuisine. The menu itself was extravagant, even by today's standards. Appetizers were caviar canap√© √† la Russe, blue points on shell, essence of tomatoes en tasse, stuffed celery, radishes and olives, and sherry. Main courses were tournedos of beef tenderloin with b√©arnaise sauce, medallions of halibut with sauce Valois, pommes dauphine, pomme pailles, haricots, flageolets, claret, supreme of chicken with fresh mushrooms, punch Benedictine, new potatoes in cream, champagne, salad Prince Arthur, cheese souffl√©, demi-tasse, and cognac. The Prince Arthur offered first-class accommodation, charging $1.50 to $2.00 a day for a regular room and $2.00 to $3.00 if you wanted a bath. The floors in the bathing rooms were made from the same marble as the rotunda. Each bedroom was twenty feet long and faced outside. The first three floors were furnished in mahogany, and the upper floors in weathered oak. Many guests arrived by rail and steamship and entered the hotel through the hotel‚Äôs famed formal gardens, which were designed by landscape artist H.F. Boyce of North Battleford, Saskatchewan. The gardens gave way to a parking lot in 1958.  Other Interesting Facts  Remnants of two tunnels are in the hotel‚Äôs basement. One tunnel lead to the lake shore while the other tunnel used to connect to a neighbouring hotel, the Marriaggi Hotel, which is now the silver government building across the street. In 1921, the poppy was first adopted as the symbol of remembrance at a meeting at the hotel and in 1991, a commemorative plaque was hung in the hotel‚Äôs lobby.  Famous People Who Have Been to the Hotel  In 1914, Mrs. MacLean, a student of the famous Russian ballet dancer Louis Chalif, ran a ballroom dance studio out of the hotel. Sir Robert Borden, Prime Minister of Canada at the time, and Lady Borden stayed at the hotel on December 31, 1914 where they were received in the drawing room. Australian contralto Eva Mylott, a prot√©g√© of the famous Dame Nellie Melba, stayed at the hotel in the mid to late 1910s. She was the paternal grandmother of actor Mel Gibson and a relative of the Australian concert pianist Tamara Anna Cislowska. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the Lakehead on May 23, 1939. A dance was held in their honour at the Prince Arthur before they continued heading west by train. The hotel also provided the dinner rolls and pastries that the royal party ate while on-board the royal car. Travelling musicians performing in town often stayed at the Prince Arthur: Duke Ellington, Harry James, Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, and Johnny Cash to name a few.

The author begins his story by declaring that on one balmy September morning in 1954 a 25-year-old Venetian man steps out of a mansion just off the Grand Canal and into the street: :He was young, perhaps no more than twenty-five, with a darkly handsome patrician face, and was, like most Venetians of his class, exquisitely tailored. He paused for a moment, in front of the great doors of the palazzo and looked up. His wife was at one of the upper windows. He smiled at her and blew her a kiss. She waved back at him. Page 13. Before the day is through, he will have died unceremoniously, and his body thrown into one of the canals. The story picks up again on page 23, apparently decades later in another part of the world when a young and wealthy computer programmer walking down East 50th Street in New York, notices in the window of an antique shop an item that catches his eye. :'The window was cluttered with a variety of articles for sale - guitars, typewriters, tape recorders, clocks, golf clubs, and a hodgepodge of jewelry, rings, necklaces, bracelets, and earrings. The medallion itself was large in size, about two inches in diameter, and hung on a gold chain. Mixed with the rest of the jewelry in the window, it was rather inconspicuous. Yet, somehow, it had drawn his attention. Page 27. and he just has to have it, even if it is overpriced, and not a legitimate hedge against inflation. Even if it is gold, it is possibly overpriced. But the medallion carries a curious coat of arms upon its face, and must have been minted privately by some noble family in Italy. And thus begins a long journey that takes him back to another man's life - and death - in Venice.

It is located in the heart of the city extending from The Octagon, the central plaza, to Moray Place through a whole city block. It is the seat of the Dunedin City Council, providing its formal meeting chamber, as well as a large auditorium and a conference centre. The oldest part of the building has been called the only substantial Victorian town hall still in existence in New Zealand.McGill and Sheehan, 1997, p.220. Name The name is ambiguous. The structure was built in two major stages with a fifty-year gap between. The first stage, built in the 19th century, is a block of offices. This was popularly called the ‚ÄúDunedin Town Hall‚Äù even though it had no auditorium. The second stage, built in the early 20th century, had not one but two auditoriums; this whole new addition was then officially designated the ‚ÄúDunedin Town Hall‚Äù, and the pre-existing office block became the ‚ÄúMunicipal Chambers‚Äù. The term ‚ÄúDunedin Town Hall‚Äù now came to be used in its official sense but also specifically for the main auditorium by itself and frequently too for the whole extended building. In the 1980s the official name for the second stage additions was changed to ‚ÄúThe Dunedin Centre‚Äù but few people know exactly what that refers to.Ledgerwood, 2008, pp.66-67. This article is about the whole building. Construction history First phase Dunedin City was incorporated in 1865, the first so constituted in New Zealand. Following the population growth and wealth generated by the Otago gold rush, the city council decided it should build new and larger premises. The settlement's first wooden town offices were demolished in 1859, and no formal structure existed after that, partly because of indecision as to where it should be.McGill and Sheehan, 1997, p.220. A decision was finally made in favour of the site of the city's first hospital. (This is commemorated by a plaque in Municipal Lane.)Herd and Griffiths, 1980, p. 81.

There are surviving working drawings signed by him in the possession of the city council, one of which is reproduced on the back cover of Trotter, 1994. Also, the Otago Daily Times supplement of 6 February 1879 reported that the ‚Äúcorporation building‚Äù was then progressing towards completion and that ‚ÄúMr R. A. Lawson is the architect for the whole block‚Äù. A contract was let to Mercer & Low for ¬£15,230 ‚Äì a considerable increase on the original budget. The foundation stone was laid on 23 May 1878 and the building was opened for business on 25 May 1880. By the time a clock had been installed the whole price was ¬£20,000.Ledgerwood, 2008, p.60. The structure was conceived as the first part of a larger complex which would eventually include an auditorium to seat 2,000 people. What was built in this first stage was a set of offices on the Octagon, with a council chamber and an observation tower, the latter intended as a lookout for the Fire Brigade.Ledgerwood, 2008, pp.59, 61. The first phase of construction included the Octagon facade. This first building has three main storeys, the ground or basement constructed of Port Chalmers breccia with the floors above built of Oamaru limestone. There was a central entrance at the first floor level ‚Äì the piano nobile in architectural terms - reached by a double flight of steps from the street. Above it there is a high tower of five more levels incorporating a clock, bells and a mansard roof. The four corners of the building also have mansard roofs. The tower is 47 metres (165 feet) to the base of the flagpole and is very prominent in central Dunedin. The building‚Äôs principal elevation still dominates the Octagon. The inspiration of the design, or at least its main elevation, is Michelangelo‚Äôs for the Palazzo Senatorio on the Piazza del Campidoglio in Rome, the seat of the Roman civic government. With its corner mansard roofs and proportionately much higher tower, Lawson‚Äôs building also echoes the old civic halls of the Netherlands, and Flanders, the latter modern Belgium - for example, the Oudenaarde Town Hall. In this the design parallels George Gilbert Scott‚Äôs for St Pancras Station in London which similarly mingles Italian and north European elements in an eclectic mix. The Sydney Town Hall, started in 1868, is a comparable mixture and its main elevation is broadly similar. So is that of the Philadelphia City Hall, started in 1871, although that is far larger, more exuberant and apparently French, and was ultimately completed to a very different plan. While probably aware of these other near contemporaries it is clear Lawson arrived at his own composition whose combination of grandeur and restraint seems characteristic. The side elevations were dressed to be seen, like the Octagon frontage, sharing its tiers of pedimented and then arched windows, Corinthian pilasters, cornice and balustrade. The rear elevation was left clearly unfinished with bricked-in apertures intended to give access to the auditorium when it was built.Ledgerwood, 2008, pp.61-62. A clock was ordered from Gillett & Bland of London, with its own peal of chimes, and was started on 2 December 1880.Trotter, 1994, pp.16-22. There was a fifty-year pause before a rearward extension was completed to a plan different from that which Lawson had envisaged. Second phase The second phase of construction included the main auditorium, at the building's Moray Place end. In 1913 the city council held a competition for the design of the Town Hall, which was won by Harry Mandeno (1879‚Äì1973) in 1914. The winning design projected two auditoria each in its own compartment: one smaller, running transversely across the site immediately behind the Municipal Chambers; the other, larger, extending from there to Moray Place, oriented on the same north/south axis as the whole site from the Octagon. The smaller auditorium, then called the Concert Hall, was to seat 600 people. The larger was to seat 3,000.Town Hall, Dunedin. Conditions of Competition. Dunedin City Council, Dunedin, 1913, p.3.\\"Dunedin Town Hall Competition\\" in Progress April 1914, p.991. Although Mandeno's name was on the winning design, it is likely it was the work of Roy Fraser (1895‚Äì1972), then too young to enter the competition independently. The First World War delayed progress, and in the early 1920s ratepayers voted against raising a loan to pay for the building. The city council's profits from its trading departments during the 1925-1926 New Zealand and South Seas International Exhibition enabled it to undertake the project and pay for it with cash. The plans were now modified explicitly by Mandeno's new partner Roy Fraser.Jackie Gillies + Associates, 2008, pp.13-14. Among other changes, the floor of the Concert Hall was lowered below that of the main auditorium and also below the first floor of the Municipal Chambers, thus placing a barrier between them. This impeded Lawson's intended entry from the Octagon to the spaces behind the Municipal Chambers, and generally made movement through the whole extended complex difficult.Ledgerwood, 2008, p.66. The foundation stone was laid on 3 March 1928 and the building was opened on 15 February 1930. The main auditorium was then, and remains, the largest in New Zealand. A graduation ceremony in the main auditorium The building was constructed of steel-reinforced concrete with Oamaru limestone cladding and was intended to harmonise with the Municipal Chambers which it physically adjoins.Town Hall, Dunedin. Conditions of Competition. Dunedin City Council, Dunedin, 1913, p.2. The initial design employed a revived Baroque style. The later re-working simplified this, making it more austere and more purely classical.Jackie Gillies + Associates, 2008, p.11. The main auditorium has a pillared and pedimented facade to Moray Place accommodating its principal entrance. Corner stairwells on the Moray Place front and comparable \\"towers\\" at the southward end give the main auditorium's building compartment a basilica-like form. The Concert Hall's entrance facade is more detailed, and more closely matches Lawson's Municipal Chambers whose west elevation it joins, making a successful transition to the plainer side of the main auditorium. The narrow Harrop Street flanks that western boundary of the whole complex while the eastern one, originally designed to be chiefly unseen, is bounded by the pedestrian walkway of Municipal Lane. The main auditorium has two galleries above the ground floor, the first arranged as a long-sided U, and an organ, installed at the back of the stage. Its ground floor foyer has an impressive barrel-vaulted, coffered ceiling. The Concert Hall, long called the Concert Chamber, had a proscenium and a single gallery. Neither auditorium had a fly tower or an orchestra pit because they were designed primarily for musical performances. The project cost ¬£86,000, exclusive of the organ. Later building history St. Paul's Anglican Cathedral and Dunedin Town Hall. In 1939, the interior of Lawson‚Äôs building was remodelled. Lifts were installed and the exterior steps were removed and replaced with a balcony.Ledgerwood, 2008, p.62. Some time before 1955, two storeys were added to the southeast corner of the 1930 extension.Jackie Gillies + Associates, Dunedin Town Hall, Conservation Report, June 2008, p.15 In 1963, the top of the Municipal Chambers' tower was removed and replaced with a truncated aluminium cap, known as \\"the meat safe\\"McFarlane, 1970 ostensibly for reasons of safety, but in fact as a prelude to demolishing the whole of Lawson‚Äôs structure.Trotter, 1994, pp.28-35, 39. This was controversial but plans to demolish the building continued to be entertained into the 1980s. Nevertheless, the then city architect Bill Hesson (1929‚Äì2007) conceived a plan to redevelop the whole complex.Trotter, 1994, pp.49-63. The Concert Chamber was substantially modified and its seating capacity reduced to become the Glenroy Auditorium by a design of Hesson's when it was made part of a conference centre, the \\"Dunedin Centre\\", in 1985-88. The main auditorium was refurbished, but not substantially changed, and a new entrance was added at the foot of the Moray Place facade in 1988-1990.Jackie Gillies + Associates, Dunedin Town Hall, Conservation Report, June 2008, pp.15, 17-18. This entrance was designed by Tim Heath. In a notable reversal of earlier intentions, in part brought about through public protest,McGill and Sheehan, 1997, p.221. Lawson‚Äôs building was now restored. Its tower and steps were replaced and its interiors thoroughly redecorated and retrofitted with modern servicing. This was done under the supervision of Hesson's successor as City Architect, Robert Tongue and was generally and critically well received. (It won the New Zealand Institute of Architects‚Äô National Award in 1991.)Ledgerwood, 2008, 64&65. The building was re-opened on 16 November 1989. The Metro Cinema was incorporated into the basement of the main auditorium in the mid 1990s.Jackie Gillies + Associates, Dunedin Town Hall, Conservation Report, June 2008, p.18. Present plans for redevelopment In the early 2000s a plan to enlarge the space available for conferences was developed. This envisaged building onto the western elevation across Harrop Street. After much public debate, this plan was abandoned in favour of making the additional provision by opening the compartment housing the Glenroy Auditorium internally into the adjacent Municipal Chambers. While further reducing the capacity of the Glenroy Auditorium this would also allow linear access through the whole extended complex from the Octagon to Moray Place at the level Lawson intended, the first floor of his Municipal Chambers. It thus mitigates the awkwardness introduced by placing the smaller compartment transversely across the site and the lower floor level of the smaller auditorium. It is also proposed to remove Mr Heath's entrance on Moray Place and to replace it with a new glass-clad structure, set slightly apart from the building. The architect is Jeff Thompson. It is anticipated construction will start in 2010 and will cost NZ$45.4 million.Loughrey, David and Morris, Chris. Town hall plan wins approval, Otago Daily Times, 7 July 2009.

Comparisons and contrasts The Dunedin Town Hall represents a type of municipal building characteristic of the mid 19th and early 20th centuries. Such structures provided civic offices, a council chamber and a large auditorium in one building and often had a clocktower. Most had an organ in the large auditorium and often a smaller auditorium for chamber music. The Dunedin building had all of these features and although its smaller auditorium is much reduced, they all survive. Sydney Town Hall has many similarities to its Dunedin equivalent. Parallel buildings in Sydney and Philadelphia have been mentioned. Those structures‚Äô principal elevations resemble Lawson‚Äôs Octagon facade, but other characteristics are different. Philadelphia City Hall extends to enclose a courtyard, while Sydney‚Äôs interior plan does not have the transverse compartment of Dunedin‚Äôs old Concert Chamber. The long gap between the Dunedin building‚Äôs two construction phases also produced a discernible disunity of styles. While Lawson‚Äôs Municipal Chambers might be described as Neo-Renaissance, Fraser‚Äôs additions are better characterised as understated Neo-Baroque. In New Zealand the Wellington Town Hall and Auckland Town Hall are comparable. The Wellington building, designed by Joshua Charlesworth and built between 1901 and 1904 in a Neo-Renaissance style, has lost its clocktower and portico. The Auckland Town Hall, opened in 1911 and designed by the Melbourne firm JJ & EJ Clarke in a Renaissance Revival manner, is better preserved. Both are rather smaller than their Dunedin counterpart. In Australia, apart from Sydney, the Adelaide Town Hall, built between 1863 and 1866 and designed by Edmund Wright and Edward Woods in a Neo-Renaissance style, is another parallel. Melbourne Town Hall is one too. Built on a corner site between 1870 and 1887 to a Second Empire design of Joseph Reed‚Äôs, it was extended in 1900, but a fire in 1925 destroyed much of it, including the main auditorium. The Perth Town Hall in Western Australia is another representative of the type, designed by Richard Roach Jewell and built between 1860 and 1870 in a revived Gothic style. To a lesser extent so too is the Hobart Town Hall, which has no tower. It was designed by Henry Hunter in an Italian classical manner and built between 1864 and 1866. In Britain the Leeds Town Hall and Manchester Town Hall are notable comparable examples, while the Sheffield Town Hall is perhaps rather less so. Leeds was designed by Cuthbert Brodrick in a Second Empire style and built between 1853 and 1858. Manchester was built between 1868 and 1877 to Alfred Waterhouse‚Äôs Gothic Revival design. Sheffield is later, built between 1890 and 1897 in Jacobethan style, and was designed by E. W. Mountford. Among these numerous parallels, the Dunedin Town Hall is distinguished by its completeness of the features which characterise the type and their survival; its relatively large scale, especially considering the size of the city it serves; the unusually long gap between its construction phases; and the aesthetic distinction of some of its features, notably Lawson's Octagon elevation. It also forms an excellent townscape with its neighbour across Harrop Street, St. Paul's Cathedral. \\"Norma\\" The Concert Hall's symphonic organ, affectionately dubbed \\"Norma\\", was built in 1919 by William Hill and Son of London, and contains 3,500 pipes.Knight and Wales, 1988, p.165. Originally considerably smaller, though still an impressive 23 tons in weight, the instrument toured England and was set up in halls and theatres as part of a travelling vaudeville show. The organ was enlarged and installed at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924, before being moved to Tunbridge Wells Opera House.Dunedin City Council, \\"Norma, the Town Hall Organ\\" . Retrieved 2009-12-03. From there, it was donated to Dunedin by Mr and Mrs A. S. Paterson at a cost to them of ¬£16,000.Norman Ledgerwood, 2008, pp.65, 67. The organ has been extensively restored, and though care has been taken to ensure that the organ's sound has not been greatly altered, this restoration has included the upgrading of the console with the latest playing accessories.Dunedin City Council, Dunedin Town Hall Organ - Restoration.

The project was commenced and was largely the masterplan of Christian IV in the early 17th century but was continued and completed by his successors. The new fortifications relied on the existing, medieval fortifications of the city but the fortified area was extended and a defensive ring around the city completed particularly with new edifices facing the sea. The ring fortification consisted of four bastioned ramparts and an annexed citadel as well as various outworks. Though largely developed to a final form in the 17th century, the fortifications remained in use until the second half of the 19th century, when they finally, a long time overdue, were decommissioned. Today only the Christianshavn Rampart and the citadel Kastellet remain intact, while the rest of the fortifications were dismantled in the years after its demise. The grounds were to a large extent laid out as parks, forming a green band around the city centre still known as the Fortification Ring, as well as for construction of a number of public buildings, including the new Copenhagen City Hall as well as a number of museums. History Christian IV's modernization project Christian IV's modernization of the fortifications of Copenhagen commenced in 1606 and would take 20 years to complete. The course of the medieval fortifications was kept but Slotsholmen was now incorporated into the complex. A large bastion in masonry was constructed on its southwestern tip and connected to Vestervold by a vaulted dam known as L√∏ngangen. In the same time, √òstervold was taken around parts of Bremerholm to meet the sea. A total of 12 bastions were constructed and just outside the entire fortification a moat was dug. Due to topographical variations in the terrain, it was constructed as a series of basins, separated by dams, to solve the problem of variations in the terrain. The uppermost basin was fed by water from Peblinges√∏en. The Western and Northern City Gates were also renovated and given tall spires and a new Eastern City Gate was built. From 1618-23 Christianshavn was laid out and incorporated as a privileged market town. Strategically situated in the middle of a shallow- watered, marshy area north of Amager, the town was fortified with low earthworks facing Amager. The rampart was constructed with four and a half bastions and a gate, known as Amager Gate. To guard the northern entrance to the port, a blockhouse was constructed on the shallow-watered Refshale√∏ in 1624. On the Zealand side of the harbour, north of the city, an advanced post, named Sankt Ann√¶ Skanse (English: St. Anne's Redoubt) was constructed, on the site later to become Kastellet. This work was begun in 1627. Expansion of the fortified city As part of his aspirations to strengthen Copenhagen as a regional centre, Christian IV decided to expand the area of the fortified city northwards. As early as 1606, when his modernization of the fortifications began, he had purchased 200 hectares of land outside the Eastern City Gate. His intention was to redevelop this area into a new district referred to as Ny K√∏benhavn (English: New Copenhagen) or Sankt Ann√¶ By (Saint Ann's Town). The plan was to change the course of √òstervold, which at that time made a bend and ran along what is today Gothersgade and Kongens Nytorv. The new √òstervold would be a direct extension of N√∏rrevold, connecting it to Sankt Ann√¶ Skanse, thereby increasing the area of the fortified city with approximately 40%. However, the 1630s was a time of economic crisis and both Sankt Ann√¶ Skanse and the new course of √òstervold was delayed with no major work going on during that decade. After both Jutland and Scania had been occupied by enemy forces in the first half of the 1640s and the Kingdom's very existence had been threatened, work on the fortifications was resumed. The new √òstervold was constructed and a new project for the fortress at Sankt Ann√¶ Skanse, with the layout of a bastioned pentagram, was completed in 1661. Decommissioning of the fortifications Remains of the fortifications are being removed c. 1900 The British bombing of Copenhagen during the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807 made it clear that the city's fortifications were outdated but during the years of economic constraints that followed, no action was taken. In 1840 Christian VIII appointed a national defense commission which two years later recommended that the existing fortifications be decommissioned. At the outbreak of the First Schleswig War in 1848, nothing had happened and considerable work was carried out to strengthen the ramparts around the city gates in the event of a German attack. In 1852, the Line of Demarcation was partially disabandoned but work to maintain and improve the ramparts were carried out as late as 1856-57. In 1868 a law finally provided for the official abolishment of the demarcation statutes and the disabandonment of the fortifications proper. In 1856-58 the city gates were dismantled. These provisions did not apply to fortifications at Christianshavn and Kastellet. Christianshavn's ramparts were extended as late as 1868-1870 with a rampart along the east coast of the newly reclaimed Refshale√∏, which only a few years later was rented out to the shipyard Burmeister & Wain. The fortifications at Christianshavn remained in use into the 20th century. Some areas were opened up in the late 1910s, and the last areas were not made public until 1961. Fortifications Ramparts The ramparts generally consisted of large earthworks with a ditch in front of it. As part of the improvements, numerous bastions were constructed along their course. In 1781, after extensive work on the fortifications in the preceding years, the bastions were given official names according to group: The bastions in Copenhagen were named for officers of note from the siege or other events of the early absolute era, the bastions at Christianshavn were named for powerful animals and at Kastellet. Since 1669, the bastions at Kastellet had been named for members of the Royal family and the King's lands. =N√∏rrevold= N√∏rrevold ran from Jarmers Tower to a site just east of N√∏rreport, at the junction of today's Gothersgade and √òster Voldgade. =Vestervold= In connection with a modernisation of Vestervold in the 1660s, the ramparts were extended towards the south from Vesterport all the way to the coastline and into the water on reclaimed seabed. The extension included three new bastions, two of which were located on reclaimed land. =√òstervold= Originally √òstervold ran from a location just east of N√∏rreport along today's Gothersgade to √òsterport's original location at the end of √òstergade. As result of Christian IV's efforts to modernize the fortifications, the southern end of √òstervold was continued around parts of Bremerholm. After the expansion of the fortified city in the 1650s, √òstervold continued N√∏rrevold in a straight north-eastern direction, connecting the fortifications to the north side of Kastellet. =Christianshavns Vold= The first Christianshavns Vold, constructed around 1620, had 4 and a half bastions. In the 1670s, when Vestervold was extended to reach the sea, Christiansvold was moved and extended to match the new course of Vestervold. The new Christianshavns Vold had 5 very large bastions. Around the entire complex was a moat with a protecting counterscarp. From 1682-92 Christianshavns Vold was extended once more, this time northwards, to guard the entrance to the harbour and protect the new base for the Royal Fleet at Nyholm. The extension included 7 new bastions, named for current members of the Royal family. The last extension of Christianshavns Vold was constructed as late as 1878-82, when a rampart was constructed along the eastern margin of the newly reclaimed Refshale√∏. City gates The gates that once guarded the entrances to the City of Copenhagen through the City Ramparts were stone buildings that had a single archway through the middle for traffic, protected by gates and portcullises. There were four gates affording access to the city. =√òsterport= √òsterport was originally located at the end of √òstergade, where Kongens Nytorv lies today. When the fortified city was expanded in the late 17th century to make room for the new Royal square and the district Saint Anne's Town, √òsterport was dismantled and a new gate built at a site close to present day √òsterport station. While the original East Gate faced east, the new gate was very close the northernmost point of the city. It is uncertain when the new √òsterport was built but it may have been as early as 1647. It was also referred to as the Elsinore Gate. Its original design is unknown but in 1708 it was rebuilt by Frederick VIII to a fairly modest design. The gate was dismantled in 1857. =N√∏rreport= N√∏rreport was located at a site where N√∏rreport station lies today. N√∏rregade, which led to the original gate, is named for it. Due to its location, it was the gate used by travellers from Norway and Sweden, arriving via Elsinore, as well as Northern Zealand. Since the Royals often resided at Frederiksborg Palace during the summer, arriving and departing through N√∏rreport, the street immediately inside the new gate was named Frederiksborggade. In 1671, during the reign of Christian V, an older gate was replaced by a new one, built to the design of Lambert van Haven. It was the tallest and finest of the city's gates with ornamentation in sandstone. It was dismantled in 1857. =Vesterport= The first Vesterport was erected in 1588 and later rebuilt in stone by Frederik III in 1668. The new gate was almost 4 metres wide and 4¬Ω metres tall and as an architectural curiosity, with canon barrels used as columns to support the main cornice. The gate was renovated in 1722 by Fredecrik IV. Vesterport was the most fortified of the city's gates. It was the gate most used for transportation of goods from Zealand. Opening to the main road which led to Kors√∏r, it was also through this gate that travellers from Jutland and Funen would normally arrive. =Amagerport= Amagerport was rebuilt in 1724 and dismantled in 1857. Image:√òsterport.jpeg√òsterport Image:Parti af N√∏rreport set inde fra byen.jpgN√∏rreport from inside the gates, painting by Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, Museum of National History Image:Vesterport.jpegVesterport Image:Amagerport.jpegAmagerport Citadel As part of Cristian IV's endeavour to improve the fortification, he planned and commenced the construction of a citadel known as Kastellet, constructed in connection with the ramparts in the form of a pentagram. Construction began in 1626 with the building of an entrenchment in the northern part of the defense wall of the city. The original plans included construction of a castle at the site for the King to seek haven in the event of siege, but this part of the plan was dropped on account of economic constraints. Construction continued with his successor King Christian III. After the Swedish siege on Copenhagen (1658‚Äì1660) the Dutch engineer Henrik R√ºse was called in to help rebuild and extend the construction. The fortification was named Citadellet Frederikshavn (\\"The Frederikshavn Citadel\\"), but it is better known as Kastellet (\\"the citadel\\"). Outside the ramparts =Demarcation line= Immediately outside the ramparts, there was a no-build zone, known as the Line of Demarcation (Danish: Demarkeringslinjen). The demarcation line was introduced in 1661 after the Assault on Copenhagen. =The Lakes= The row of lakes today known as S√∏erne used to be located just outside the fortifications, running along N√∏rrevold as well as parts of √òstervold and Vestervold. They originate in a need for dammed water for watermills, leading to the creation of the first lake, but after a siege of Copenhagen in 1523, it was decided to extend the entrenchments for strategic purposes, incorporating them into the defence of the city as an extra barrier. The levee at Peblinge S√∏ was expanded and another dam was constructed, which resulted in the creation of Sortedams S√∏. In the beginning of the 17th century, Sankt J√∏rgens S√∏ was created, as a result of further damming. As a results of these efforts, it was now possible to flood the banks and lakes in case of an attack on the city. Other uses Gunpowder magazines Many gunpowder magazines were located in the fortifications After his appointment as Naval Building Master at Holmen, Hans van Steenwinckel the Youngest was responsible for the construction of two gunpowder magazines at the Christianshavn Rampart. Construction of the first magazine, located at Vilhelms Bastion, was commenced in 1688, while the second one, built to a similar design at Carls Bastion, began two years later. The gunpowder magazine at the Eastern Rampart exploded on two occasions. The first time was on 16 December 1658, during the Swedish siege of Copenhagen in the Second Northern War. On 31 March 1779 it exploded again. Seven people were killed and 47 were injured. It was subsequently rebuilt and not decommissioned until 1872. The explosion of the gunpowder magazine next to the Eastern City Gate in 1779 Windmills Many of the bastions were used for the construction of wind mills. Due to their height they offered particularly good wind conditions. In the same time, a fortified city needed secure supplies, including supplies of flour and rolled groats, in the event of siege. In 1800, a total of 16 windmills were found on the ramparts of Copenhagen. In 1669-70 windmills were constructed on both of the bastions flanking Amager City Gate in Christianshavns Rampart, then known as the Mill Bastion (now the Elephant's Bastion) and the Bastion at the Church (now the Lion's Bastion). Breslaus M√∏lle on the Mill Bastion was demolished in 1842. Little Mill on the Lion's Bastion was originally a post mill but it was destroyed in a storm and replaced by a smock mill in 1783. It remained in use til the late 19th century, from 1832 supplemented by a steam mill which remained in use until 1909. Also in 1669, the miller Hans Hansen obtained permission to build a mill on Gyldenl√∏ves Bastion, just south of the Western City Gate. Whether it later burned or was never built is uunknown, but in 1697 J√ºrgen Gosbruch, another miller, received permission to build a windmill on the same site. It was known as Luciem√∏lle or Lusse M√∏llen. Some time during the 1790s, another windmill, known as Store Kongens M√∏lle (English: Large King's Mill), was built on Shacks Bastion on the other side of the Western City Gate. in 1692 a windmill was also built at Gothersgade, on the old Eastern Rampart. Dronningens M√∏lle (English:Queen's Mill) was located on Rosenkrantz' Bastion in the Eastern Rampart. It was completely destroyed when the gunpowder magazine at the Eastern Rampart exploded on 31 March 1779. It was rebuilt but torn down in 1895. When the British besieged Copenhagen in 1807, it was feared that they would destroy the mills on the fortifications. Therefore two extra mills were constructed on less exposed locations, one at S√∏lvgade and one on Nyholm. The fortifications today Fortification Ring The grounds which used to be occupied by the fortifications are still known as the Fortification Ring (Danish: F√¶stningsringen). From the ramparts were first decommissioned and purchased by the City of Copenhagen, their grounds have been dominated by parks and other recreational uses. It is still municipal policy that the Fortication Ring is maintained and developed as a green band within the urban area of the city. Parks located within the Fortification Ring include √òstre Anl√¶g, University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden and √òrstedsparken. The preserved parts of the fortifications at Christianshavn and Kastellet are also green and serve as parks. This also applies for Freetown Christiania which is partially located on the northern part of the Christianshavn Ramparts. The area also houses a number of museums, including the National Gallery, The Hirschsprung Collection and Lille M√∏lle.

It is one of several graph polynomials studied in algebraic graph theory. Definition Several different types of matching polynomials have been defined. Let G be a graph with n vertices and let mk be the number of k-edge matchings. One matching polynomial of G is :m_G(x) := \\\\sum_{k\\\\geq0} m_k x^k. Another definition gives the matching polynomial as :M_G(x) := \\\\sum_{k\\\\geq0} (-1)^k m_k x^{n-2k}. A third definition is the polynomial :\\\\mu_G(x,y) := \\\\sum_{k\\\\geq0} m_k x^k y^{n-2k}. Each type has its uses, and all are equivalent by simple transformations. For instance, :M_G(x) = x^n m_G(-x^{-2}) and :\\\\mu_G(x,y) = y^n m_G(x/y^2). Connections to other polynomials The first type of matching polynomial is a direct generalization of the rook polynomial. The second type of matching polynomial has remarkable connections with orthogonal polynomials. For instance, if G = Km,n, the complete bipartite graph, then the second type of matching polynomial is related to the generalized Laguerre polynomial LnŒ±(x) by the identity: : M_{K_{m,n}}(x) = n! L_n^{(m-n)}(x^2). \\\\, If G is the complete graph Kn, then MG(x) is an Hermite polynomial: : M_{K_n}(x) = H_n(x), \\\\, where Hn(x) is the \\"probabilist's Hermite polynomial\\" (1) in the definition of Hermite polynomials. These facts were observed by . If G is a forest, then its matching polynomial is equal to the characteristic polynomial of its adjacency matrix. If G is a path or a cycle, then MG(x) is a Chebyshev polynomial. In this case ŒºG(1,x) is a Fibonacci polynomial or Lucas polynomial respectively. Complementation The matching polynomial of a graph G with n vertices is related to that of its complement by a pair of (equivalent) formulas. One of them is a simple combinatorial identity due to . The other is an integral identity due to . There is a similar relation for a subgraph G of Km,n and its complement in Km,n. This relation, due to Riordan (1958), was known in the context of non-attacking rook placements and rook polynomials. Applications in chemical informatics The Hosoya index of a graph G, its number of matchings, is used in chemoinformatics as a structural descriptor of a molecular graph. It may be evaluated as mG(1) . The third type of matching polynomial was introduced by as a version of the \\"acyclic polynomial\\" used in chemistry. Computational complexity On arbitrary graphs, or even planar graphs, computing the matching polynomial is #P-complete . However, it can be computed more efficiently when additional structure about the graph is known. In particular, computing the matching polynomial on n-vertex graphs of treewidth k is fixed-parameter tractable: there exists an algorithm whose running time, for any fixed constant k, is a polynomial in n with an exponent that does not depend on k . The matching polynomial of a graph with n vertices and clique-width k may be computed in time nO(k) .  References  *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *.

Rodrigo's capital was Santillana some of his dealings with the monastery have come down to us. Rodrigo Mu√±oz (floruit 1084‚Äì1116), son of Count Munio Gonz√°lez and Mayor Mu√±oz, was a Castilian magnate in the kingdoms of Le√≥n and Castile. His tenancies were mostly in Cantabria, in the northern Castilian lands bordering the Basque country. Rodrigo is first mentioned in June 1085, when he and his sister Jimena made a pious donation to Santa Mar√≠a del Puerto.Barton, 296. It is thought that this sister is the Jimena Mu√±oz who was mistress to Alfonso VI. Other siblings were Urraca Mu√±oz, wife of count G√≥mez Gonz√°lez, and Enderquina Mu√±oz, wife of count Fernando D√≠az. Cf. Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n, 11‚Äì40; Salazar y Acha, 299‚Äì336. In July 1090 he and his brother Gutierre judged a lawsuit between the church and a certain Mart√≠n C√≠dez.Barton, 296. He and his brother's property had already been mentioned in a private charter of 1084 involving property iusta limites de filios de comite Monio Gonzalbiz (beside the boundary of the sons of count Munio Gonz√°lez). He married a woman named Teresa sometime before March 1103, when they completed an exchange of properties (their land at Ore√±a for an estate in the Toranzo valley) with the monastery of Santillana del Mar. As early as 1104 he was ruling Asturias de Santillana, the eastern part of Asturias, bordering northwestern Castile.Reilly, 282‚Äì83. The first document citing him as such in Barton, 296, is dated February 1109. Rodrigo's daughter, called Mayor or Guntroda, married Pedro Fr√≥ilaz de Traba, a powerful Galician magnate, sometime before May 1105.Barton, 296. She was living as late as 26 March 1125, when she, comitis Ruderici et comitisse Tharasiae filia, made a donation to the monastery at Sahag√∫n. By September 1105 Rodrigo had been appointed a count (Latin comes or consul) by Alfonso VI. This was the highest rank in Castile during the twelfth century. By February 1109 Rodrigo was also ruling Li√©bana in the far west of Castile. After the death of Alfonso VI, Alfonso's daughter Urraca became queen. The day after the king's burial, 22 July 1109, Urraca confirmed all the privileges of the Diocese of Le√≥n. Rodrigo was then present.Reilly, 56, who here and elsewhere refers to him as \\"of Astorga\\" for reasons unknown. In June 1110 Rodrigo signed the first document of Queen Urraca after her marriage to Alfonso the Battler in which she did not refer to him, simply calling herself \\"Queen of Spain\\" (Ispanie regina): a sign of Rodrigo's political allegiance.Reilly, 67‚Äì68. In January 1111 Rodrigo was again present at Urraca's court shortly after her husband had departed from it.Reilly, 71. On 11 August 1111, in a donation of Urraca to Santillana del Mar, he was cited as \\"Count Don Rodrigo of Asturias\\".Comes Dopnus Rodericus Asturiensis. By February 1112 he was governor of the Trasmiera, the Castilian lands north of the Miera river. He may have been displaced in Asturias by Rodrigo Gonz√°lez de Lara, although this may have been brief: there is a royal charter of January 1113 that records Rodrigo Mu√±oz as count in Asturias.Reilly, 89 and 283. A charter of 28 February 1112 reads: Potestate in Mera et in Asturias Rodrigo Gonsalvez ... in Trasmiera Comite Rodrigo Munnioz ([having] the power in Mena and in Asturias Rodrigo Gonz√°lez ... in Trasmiera count Rodrigo Mu√±oz). In May 1112 a certain count Rodrigo confirmed two royal charters as ruling in castella, \\"in Castile\\", that is, Old Castile.Pallar√©s and Portela, 168. This may have been either Rodrigo Mu√±oz or Rodrigo Gonz√°lez. Another charter, from late 1110, calls Rodrigo Mu√±oz \\"Count of Castile\\", but its accuracy is questionable.Reilly, 74 n100. The last record of Rodrigo ruling in Asturias dates from February 1116. Santa Mar√≠a del Puerto, the only monastery known to have been patronised by Rodrigo. Still looking much as it did then. The last record of Rodrigo alive dates to July 1116. One charter referring to comite Rodericus Munioz totius Asturiensis (count Rodrigo Mu√±oz of all Asturias) is misdated to 1082.

They contended that Knickerbocker had made antisemitic remarks and denied the Ward Medal for proficiency in French to a Jewish student, Morton Gurewitch, because he was Jewish. In April 1947, CCNY administrators issued a report finding that a clerical error had led to the denial the Ward Medal to Gurewitch. Gurewitch was later issued a duplicate medal.  Investigations  On December 16, 1946, New York City's Board of Higher Education unanimously adopted the report of a special committee that found the accusations against Knickerbocker \\"totally unsubstantiated.\\" In response, the New York City Council's special committee on discrimination conducted its own investigation and determined that Knickerbocker had made antisemitic jokes and treated Jewish students contemptuously. In June 1948, it recommended that CCNY remove Knickerbocker and restore Bach-y-Rita and Pollinger to the list of recommendations for promotion, from which both professors had been removed in retaliation for their charges against Knickerbocker. The City Council voted to accept the committee's report. Administrators at CCNY delayed Knickerbocker's dismissal. A faculty committee produced a report that exonerated Knickerbocker and the faculty adopted it by a 46‚Äì9 vote. The American Jewish Congress conducted an investigation and concluded that Knickerbocker demonstrated a \\"philosophy and program of anti- semitism.\\" In September 1948, twenty students walked out of Knickerbocker's class. Rabbi Arthur Zuckerman, director of the campus chapter of Hillel, attempted to negotiate with the school to allow students to transfer into other classes.  Dormitory segregation  In 1948, a faculty committee found that the professor in charge of the Army Hall dormitory, William E. Davis, had segregated the dormitory during World War II. Davis was removed from his post as director of the dormitory, but retained his position as a tenured professor in the economics department.  Student strike  In October 1948, 2,000 students held a fiery meeting and a \\"sit-down\\" to demand the removal of Knickerbocker from the faculty. CCNY administrators suspended classes. In April 1949, the student council voted to hold a general student strike to demand the trial and removal of both Knickerbocker and Davis. On April 11, students battled police in \\"near riot proportions,\\" some shouting \\"Jim Crow must go.\\" Sixteen students were arrested. Some 65 percent of students stayed away from classes. The student council of the business school voted to condemn the strike.  Aftermath  Bach-y-Rita and Pollinger asked State Education Commissioner, Francis T. Spaulding, to order the Board of Higher Education to file formal charges against Knickerbocker. In February 1950, the Board of Higher Education, which had originally dismissed the complaint against Knickerbocker, declared that there was no reason to reopen its investigation. It also declined to address the restoration of Bach-y-Rita and Pollinger to the list of recommendations for promotion. Spaulding supported the Board. Several days later, Knickerbocker announced that he would not stand as a candidate for re-election as chairman of the Department of Romance Languages, though he would continue as a professor. A July 1950 report by the Associate Alumni of City College stated that \\"[i]t cannot be said with any degree of certainty that Prof. William E. Knickerbocker was antisemitic. By the same token, it likewise cannot be said with any degree of certainty that he was not.\\" Regarding Davis, who had been found guilty of maintaining segregated dormitories in Army Hall, the alumni wrote that his actions were \\"ill- considered rather than motivated by racial bias,\\" although it approved of his removal as director of the dormitory by the president of the college. Knickerbocker retired in 1955 and died on December 21, 1960, at the age of 75 at St. Luke's Hospital in New York. CCNY alumni continued to commemorate the 1949 strike, which for many students marked the beginning of their political involvement in progressive causes and in civil rights.

K. Weir is a Canadian politician from Saskatchewan. From 2015 until 2019, he was Member of Parliament for the riding of Regina‚ÄîLewvan. Weir initially sat as a member of the federal New Democratic Party (NDP) and was appointed the party's critic for Public Services and Procurement Canada. Before entering federal politics, Weir ran in the 2013 Saskatchewan New Democratic Party leadership election and was an economist with the Canadian section of the United Steelworkers union. Weir was expelled from the NDP caucus on May 3, 2018 after a third party investigation into three claims of sexual harassment. Following his expulsion, he changed his affiliation to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), the precursor to the NDP, and became the first CCF MP since 1961. Early life and career Weir was born in 1982 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Weir holds three university degrees: a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Regina, a Master of Arts from the University of Calgary, and a Master of Public Administration from Queen's University.https://ourspace.uregina.ca/bitstream/handle/10294/1128/Degrees_v18no2_Fall2006.pdf In May 2012 while Weir was an economist working with the United Steelworkers and presenting in front of the Parliamentary Finance committee, he was questioned by Conservative MP Randy Hoback ‚Äì who asked \\"Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the NDP party[sic]\\".http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/05/31/have-you-ever-been-a-member-of- the-ndp-party/ CBC and Maclean's made comparisons to McCarthyism based on this line of questioning from Hoback. Political career  In 2004, Weir ran in the federal riding of Wascana against Liberal finance minister Ralph Goodale as the New Democratic Party's candidate, but was defeated. 2013 Saskatchewan New Democratic Party leadership election In June 2012 a group of Canadian economists sent a public letter calling on Erin Weir to enter the 2013 Saskatchewan New Democratic Party leadership election.http://www.progressive-economics.ca/2012/06/19/our-own-erin-weir- would-make-a-great-sask-ndp-leader/ Also a group of notable New Democrats including former NDP MP Dick Proctor and former NDP premier Howard Pawley of Manitoba created a \\"Committee to Draft Erin Weir\\". On September 7, 2012 Weir, then aged 30, announced he was entering the race. He addressed the issue of his not having a seat by saying \\"I would see it advantageous as having a leader that is not tied down to Regina all the time and free to tour the province.\\" He also made the comparison to Jack Layton and the federal NDP of the time.http://www.newstalk650.com/story/erin-weir-running-sask-ndp- leadership/73935 Earlier that week, he had addressed his age saying the age of the candidate should not be the focus of voters and that \\"Public policy is more important,\\".http://metronews.ca/news/regina/357410/sask-ndp-look-for-new- leader/ He was one of four declared candidates including MLA Cam Broten, doctor Ryan Meili, and MLA Trent Wotherspoon. His campaign was described by the media as organizedhttps://leaderpost.com/news/GORMLEY+Assessing+leaders+would+leaders/7203980/story.html and one of the main political commentators in the province said the race was \\"highly competitive\\"https://leaderpost.com/news/must+leadership+right/7190667/story.html and \\"The fact they could all win is probably incentive for all four to run.\\"http://www.globalsaskatoon.com/saskatchewan+ndp+talks+of+rebuilding+as+it+launches+search+for+new+leader/6442708309/story.html On February 20, 2013, Weir withdrew from the leadership race and endorsed fellow candidate Ryan Meili.  Federal politics  On April 11, 2014, Weir announced that he was seeking the NDP nomination in the new federal riding of Regina‚ÄîLewvan.http://www.punditsguide.ca/tag/open-seats/ He was nominated on June 22, 2014, defeating former 2011 Palliser federal NDP candidate Noah Evanchuk. He was elected on October 19, 2015, prevailing over Conservative candidate Trent Fraser by 132 votes according to the results validated by the Returning Officer. Fraser initially requested a recount, but the request was later withdrawn. Weir was appointed the party's critic for Public Services and Procurement Canada in November 2015. He was also appointed as the Vice-Chair of the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates in December 2015. After the federal government announced a pan-Canadian price on carbon, Weir called for border adjustments to that pricing, pointing out that different carbon prices between countries can result in \\"carbon leakage\\". Weir's proposal was eventually adopted by Peter Julian, during his campaign for federal NDP Leader. Weir was one of the first MPs to raise the issue of problems with the new federal payroll system called Phoenix. Civilian employees at the RCMP's \\"Depot\\" Division living in his riding brought them to his attention.https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/local-mps-at-heart-of- phoenix-controversy  Harassment Allegations  In February 2018, Weir was suspended from his caucus duties by party leader Jagmeet Singh pending an independent investigation made into sexual harassment allegations made against him. Weir was expelled from the NDP caucus on May 3, 2018 following his public comments to the media regarding the outcome of the sexual harassment investigation, and for revealing confidential information about a complainant. The investigation found that one claim of harassment and three claims of sexual harassment were sustained by the evidence. As an independent member, Weir asked Speaker Geoff Regan to have his affiliation switched to the Co- operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), the predecessor of the modern NDP. As the House of Commons does not require that a party be registered with Elections Canada for the purposes of MPs declaring affiliation, the affiliation change was accepted and Weir became the first CCF MP since 1961. In May 2018, a group of 67 former NDP MPs and MLAs from Saskatchewan sent Singh a letter in support of Weir and calling for his reinstatement as an NDP MP. On September 6, 2018, it was publicly revealed that NDP Leader Singh had rejected Weir's request to rejoin the NDP during a meeting in June, despite Weir stating that he had worked with a personal trainer to understand the issues of the complaint. Singh also said that Weir will not be permitted to run as an NDP candidate in the 2019 federal election. Although Weir had announced that he intended to seek the party's nomination in Regina‚ÄîLewvan, he retracted that statement, citing NDP Leader Singh's continued refusal for Weir to run for the party's nomination without appeal.https://www.erinweir.com/election2019 On May 21, 2019, Weir announced he would not run for reelection.

The entire treasury including its sculptural decoration is built of Parian marble. The date of construction is disputed, and scholarly opinions range from 510 to 480 BCE. It is located directly below the Temple of Apollo along the Sacred Way for all visitors to view the Athenian treasury on the way up to the sanctuary. Pausanias mentions the building in his account of the sanctuary, claiming that it was dedicated from the spoils of the Battle of Marathon, fought in 490 BCE against the Persians. The Battle of Marathon can be seen in some of the images of the metopes which compare their victory to mythology. By using the founder of Athens, Theseus, to show the victories of Athens, the treasury established Athens as one of the most powerful, polis, city-states of Greece. According to archeological records, the Athenian treasury metopes display the earliest known presence of Theseus in a large-scale sculpture. Prior to this treasury, Theseus had been depicted on vase paintings, but never before on architecture. Although Herakles was also depicted in the metopes, the added heroic character showed the Athenian's increasing devotion to Theseus. The pairing of the two heroes was a metaphor alluding to the Battle of Marathon. The metopes show Athenian identity and how they viewed their enemies both foreign or domestic. Several other city-states built treasuries in the panhellenic site of Delphi. Among other firsts, the Athenian treasury was also the first Panhellenic sanctuary that was dedicated by Athenians. The building was excavated by the French School at Athens, led by Pierre de La Coste-Messeli√®re, and reconstructed from 1903‚Äì1906. The structure is still visible in situ, although the metopes are reproductions; the originals are kept in the museum of Delphi. Metopes Metope from the southern side of the Treasury of Athenians at Delphi. Theseus and Antiope. Theseus battling with the Queen of Amazons, around 500 BC. Archaeological Museum of Delphi. The thirty metopes of the treasury are 67 cm tall and 62‚Äì64 cm wide, nine along the long sides (north and south) and six along the short (east and west), depicted the labors of Herakles and Theseus. This is the earliest surviving juxtaposition of the two. Many of these metopes were found in the surrounding area and it is disputed on the order to which they would have appeared. Theseus was the mythical king of Athens and its founder. Thesean metopes include: * Theseus and Athena * Theseus and Sinis * Theseus and the Crommyonian sow * Theseus and Sciron * Theseus and Cercyon * Theseus and Procrustes * Theseus and the Bull of Marathon * Theseus and the Minotaur * Theseus and the Captive Amazon Heroklean metopes include: * Heracles and the Nemean Lion * Heracles and the Ceryneian Hind * Heracles and the Centaur * Heracles and Cycnus * Heracles and Orthrus * Cows of Geryon (three metopes) * Geryon Inscription Inscription The platform upon which the treasury stands has a prominent inscription on its south face; it is dated internally to post-490 BCE.

The Athenians dedicated this to Apollo as first-fruits from the Persians at the Battle of Marathon.  Construction  The Athenian Treasury in Delphi was built according to a typical distyle in antis design, with two antae framing two columns. The ancient writer and traveler Pausanias was ‚Äúemphatic that the Athenian Treasury was built [meaning financed] from the spoils from the landing of the Persian general Datis at Marathon‚Äù. This means that a date later than 490 BCE, after the Battle of Marathon and accounting for time of construction would be acceptable to Pausanias. Despite being a primary source, Pausanias on occasion may have been misguided or misinformed, and classical scholars still maintain the great date debate. John Boardman notes that ‚Äúon a purely archaeological, architectural and stylistic grounds the Treasury has appeared to many scholars to date around 500 BCE, and some would put it earlier.‚Äù Recent findings compiled by University of Chicago professor Richard T. Neer, referencing excavations from 1989 (summarized by Pierre Amandry in 1998), advocates for the later date: > ‚ÄúA ledge of 0.30 meters in width projects from the Treasury‚Äôs stereobate > along its south side only, and that this ledge helps to support the Marathon > base. In other words, the plan of the Treasury takes the base into account > from the earliest phase of construction. The two structures are thus > integral, and both must date after the battle of Marathon in 490 BCE. With > this archaeological datum, the chronology of the Athenian treasury must be > considered settled. Pausanias was correct.‚Äù It is debated to have an earlier construction date due to the late archaic style used for the architecture. The Doric style was modeled after the use of wood to create structures. The paintings inside the treasury were dated back to the 480's BCE making specialists believe construction started before the military win.  Votive Offerings  The treasury was made to contain votive offerings such as spoils of war and Kouros. This is where the famous twin kouros statues, Kleobis and Bition, were found. They were originally made at the Temple of Athena in Argos, but were given to the Athenian Treasury as a mark of respect. Due to Athens being a super power at the time, many city- states paid them for protection. The treasury was not only an offering to the gods, but a statement of their power showing off armors, statuettes, and other pottery. The treasury was also a statement about the wealth of their new government. After transitioning from a tyrant ruled city-state into a democracy, the Athenians sought to internationally display their increased military success, wealth and prosperity. Votive offerings were often given after a great win, a prayer, or a funeral piece. These offerings were given by all Greeks to the gods in a sign of worship. Having separate treasuries allowed Athens to show more of their prominent victories and achievements, establishing their identity as a people and also to show the rest of Greece that they were elites in the hierarchy.  The Battle of Marathon  The Battle of Marathon occurred in 490 BCE between the Persians and the Athenians. It was a decisive blow against Persia during the first Greco-Persian War. After the battle, the spoils of war were used to either create or upgrade the treasury and store many of the other spoils as gifts to the gods. The metope of Theseus and the Bull of Marathon shows how the Athenians tried to tie the win to their divine right to be the head polis and rule over the others. This also tied their mythology more closely to their reality.  Mythology and the Metopes  The main characters of the metopes are from common Athenian mythology showing these heroes undergo their many trials. The metopes show Theseus, the mythological founder and king of Athens. His mother, though human, was possessed by Poseidon at the time of conception. The labors of Theseus began in order to claim the thrown as he travels through the six entrances to the underworld. Each labor is depicted in the form of a metope, his strength metaphorically showing Athenian prowess on the international stage that was Greece at the time. Herakles at the time was the second most mentioned and decorated hero to appear in Athens. Athens wanted to be seen as related not just to their own personal hero Theseus but connect him to Herakles as a relation to the gods. Each metope contains a single deed done by each hero as they tried to reach their goal. This put the polis-hero on equal level to Herakles even including a later version of Theseus that occurred after 460 BCE when Theseus used his club against Periphetes making him look very similar to Herakles. The metopes also draw parallels between the two heroes with the bull to which Herakles captured as his seventh labor from Crete which later Theseus captures and sacrifices to Apollo/Athena.  Role at a Panhellenic Sanctuary  This treasury held and displayed the votive offerings dedicated to the god Apollo at Delphi. The amount of dedications given would determine the power, range, and existence of the god. The treasury would house and protect the most durable offerings and also precious offerings that could withstand time. The Athenian Treasury is one of the more elaborate treasuries to show the prosperity of Athens. The dedications belonged to Apollo and were not allowed to leave the sanctuary. The offerings stay within the temenos but were buried in votive pits once they were found to no longer be practical to display. The offerings would get more elaborate with the status of the Athenians, especially after winning a war in which they thought Apollo had showed them favor. A panhellenic sanctuary was open for all of the city-states. The Athenians took this chance to display their civic pride and prosperity to not only the other city-states but to the gods and show them that they deserved their favor.  The Site of Delphi  192x192pxIt is important to note the historical and geographical importance of the area in which the Athenian treasury is located. The Athenians, Siphnians, and the Sikyonians each had their own treasury lining the pathway to the Temple of Apollo, at the site of Delphi. The geographical location of the Temple of Apollo was significant in Greek mythology as it was the destination where two eagles, placed at opposite ends of the earth by Zeus, met. This temple was considered an oracle, where Apollo could communicate to humans through the Pythia. The Greeks, their leaders and other foreign leaders journeyed to the temple of Apollo seeking advice from the Pythia, despite misinterpretations often leading to twists in fate. Much like the Olympics today, the site of Delphi hosted the Pythian games as a dedication to Apollo, in the site's Greek theater. As well as athletic competitions, the Pythian games also held poetry, dance and music contests, drawing in spectators and crowds. The presence of the oracle and the Pythian games, allowed the Athenians to showcase their treasury on an international scale.

The underlying model represents a modified version of the relative environmental suitability (RES) model developed by Kristin Kaschner to generate global predictions of marine mammal occurrences. According to the AquaMaps website on August 2013, the project held standardized distribution maps for over 17,300 species of fishes, marine mammals and invertebrates. The project is also expanding to incorporate freshwater species, with more than 600 biodiversity maps for freshwater fishes of the Americas available as at November 2009. AquaMaps predictions have been validated successfully for a number of species using independent data sets and the model was shown to perform equally well or better than other standard species distribution models, when faced with the currently existing suboptimal input data sets. In addition to displaying individual maps per species, AquaMaps provides tools to generate species richness maps by higher taxon, plus a spatial search for all species overlapping a specified grid square. There is also the facility to create custom maps for any species via the web by modifying the input parameters and re-running the map generating algorithm in real time, and a variety of other tools including the investigation of effects of climate change on species distributions (see relevant section of the AquaMaps search page).

Redis supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, HyperLogLogs, bitmaps, streams, and spatial indexes. The project is mainly developed by Salvatore Sanfilippo and is sponsored by Redis Labs. It is open-source software released under a BSD 3-clause license. History The name Redis means REmote DIctionary Server. The Redis project began when Salvatore Sanfilippo, nicknamed antirez, the original developer of Redis, was trying to improve the scalability of his Italian startup, developing a real-time web log analyzer. After encountering significant problems in scaling some types of workloads using traditional database systems, Sanfilippo began to prototype a first proof of concept version of Redis in Tcl. Later Sanfilippo translated that prototype to the C language and implemented the first data type, the list. After a few weeks of using the project internally with success, Sanfilippo decided to open source it, announcing the project on Hacker News. The project began to get traction, more so among the Ruby community, with GitHub and Instagram being among the first companies adopting it. Sanfilippo was hired by VMware in March, 2010. In May, 2013, Redis was sponsored by Pivotal Software (a VMware spin-off). In June 2015, development became sponsored by Redis Labs. In October 2018 Redis 5.0 was released, introducing Redis Stream - a new data structure that allows storage of multiple fields and string values with an automatic, time-based sequence at a single key.https://redislabs.com/blog/redis-5-0-is-here/ Differences with other database systems Redis popularized the idea of a system that can be considered at the same time a store and a cache, using a design where data is always modified and read from the main computer memory, but also stored on disk in a format that is unsuitable for random access of data, but only to reconstruct the data back in memory once the system restarts. At the same time, Redis provides a data model that is very unusual compared to a relational database management system (RDBMS). User commands do not describe a query to be executed by the database engine but rather specific operations that are performed on given abstract data types. Hence, data must be stored in a way which is suitable later for fast retrieval, without help from the database system in form of secondary indexes, aggregations or other common features of traditional RDBMS. The Redis implementation makes heavy use of the fork system call, to duplicate the process holding the data, so that the parent process continues to serve clients, while the child process creates a copy of the data on disk. Popularity According to monthly DB-Engines rankings, Redis is often the most popular key-value database. Redis has also been ranked the #4 NoSQL database in user satisfaction and market presence based on user reviews, the most popular NoSQL database in containers, and the #4 Data store of 2019 by ranking website stackshare.io. It was voted most loved database in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 . Supported languages Since version 2.6, Redis features server-side scripting in the language Lua. Many programming languages have Redis language bindings on the client side, including: ActionScript, C, C++, C#, Chicken, Clojure, Common Lisp, Crystal, D, Dart, Elixir, Erlang, Go, Haskell, Haxe, Io, Java, JavaScript (Node.js), Julia, Lua, Objective-C, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Pure Data, Python, R, Racket, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Smalltalk, Swift, and Tcl. Several client software programs exist in these languages. Data types Redis maps keys to types of values. An important difference between Redis and other structured storage systems is that Redis supports not only strings, but also abstract data types: * Lists of strings * Sets of strings (collections of non- repeating unsorted elements) * Sorted sets of strings (collections of non- repeating elements ordered by a floating-point number called score) * Hash tables where keys and values are strings * HyperLogLogs used for approximated set cardinality size estimation, available since Redis 2.8.9 in April 2014.https://redislabs.com/blog/redis-5-0-is-here/ * Stream of entries with consumer groups, allows you to store multiple fields and string values with an automatic, time-based sequence at a single key, available since Redis 5.0 in October 2018https://redislabs.com/blog/redis-5-0-is-here/ * Geospatial data through the implementation of the geohash technique, available since Redis 3.2. The type of a value determines what operations (called commands) are available for the value. Redis supports high-level, atomic, server-side operations like intersection, union, and difference between sets and sorting of lists, sets and sorted sets. More data types are supported based on Redis Modules API. The Redis module RedisJSON implements ECMA-404 (the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Standard) as a native data type. Persistence Redis typically holds the whole dataset in memory. Versions up to 2.4 could be configured to use what they refer to as virtual memory in which some of the dataset is stored on disk, but this feature is deprecated. Persistence in Redis can be achieved through two different methods. First by snapshotting, where the dataset is asynchronously transferred from memory to disk at regular intervals as a binary dump, using the Redis RDB Dump File Format. Alternatively by journaling, where a record of each operation that modifies the dataset is added to an append-only file (AOF) in a background process. Redis can rewrite the append-only file in the background to avoid an indefinite growth of the journal. Journaling was introduced in version 1.1 and is generally considered the safer approach. By default, Redis writes data to a file system at least every 2 seconds, with more or less robust options available if needed. In the case of a complete system failure on default settings, only a few seconds of data would be lost. Replication Redis supports master-replica replication. Data from any Redis server can replicate to any number of replicas. A replica may be a master to another replica. This allows Redis to implement a single-rooted replication tree. Redis replicas can be configured to accept writes, permitting intentional and unintentional inconsistency between instances. The publish/subscribe feature is fully implemented, so a client of a replica may subscribe to a channel and receive a full feed of messages published to the master, anywhere up the replication tree. Replication is useful for read (but not write) scalability or data redundancy. Performance When the durability of data is not needed, the in- memory nature of Redis allows it to perform well compared to database systems that write every change to disk before considering a transaction committed. Redis operates as a single process and is single-threaded or double-threaded when it rewrites the AOF (append-only file). Thus, a single Redis instance cannot use parallel execution of tasks such as stored procedures. Clustering Redis introduced clustering in April 2015 with the release of version 3.0. The cluster specification implements a subset of Redis commands: all single-key commands are available, multi-key operations (commands related to unions and intersections) are restricted to keys belonging to the same node, and commands related to database selection operations are unavailable. A Redis cluster can scale up to 1,000 nodes, achieve \\"acceptable\\" write safety and to continue operations when some nodes fail. Use cases Due to the nature of the database design, typical use cases are session caching, full page cache, message queue applications, leaderboards and counting among others. Large companies such as Twitter are using Redis, Amazon Web Services is offering Redis in its portfolio, Microsoft is offering the Redis Cache in Azure, and Alibaba is offering ApsaraDB for Redis in Alibaba Cloud.

History Some believe the White River Monster may have affected the Civil War. The river was used for transportation, and the monster was supposedly responsible for overturning a boat. Sightings of the monster began in 1915. On July 1 of that year, an owner of a plantation near the river saw the monster. He reported it having gray skin and \\"as wide as a car and three cars long.\\" As the news spread construction of a rope net began, but ended due to lack of money and materials. In the first week of 1937, recreational fishermen noticed that they were finding it hard to land many fish, and the creature was spotted again, and reported to Bramlett Bateman, a nearby plantation owner, who later confirmed the sighting, describing it as having \\"the skin of an elephant, four or five feet wide by twelve feet long, with the face of a catfish, . . . lolling on the surface of the water.\\" Feeling the creature was a threat to his crops, he intended to blow up the eddy where the creature was spotted with TNT, but area authorities denied necessary permission. A minor media sensation resulted in visitors from across the nation, some bringing cameras, explosives, and a machine gun, and when no more sightings were made, when a plan to capture it with a giant net failed, and when a deep sea diver failed to find the creature, Bateman was thought to have created a hoax, despite over 100 confirmed sightings recorded during the short period of excitement.100 Strangest Mysteries, Matt Lamy, MetroBooks, NY NY, 2003, p 18-19. The White River Monster was sighted again in the summer of 1971. That year, eyewitnesses who encountered the creature described it as \\"the size of a boxcar\\" with a bone protruding from its forehead. \\"It looked as if the thing was peeling all over, but it was a smooth type of skin or flesh,\\" said one, and it made strange noises that sounded like a combination of a \\"cow's moo and a horse's neigh.\\" Other accounts of the White River Monster described three-toed tracks, in length, on Towhead Island leading down to the river through a path of bent trees and crushed bushes. In 1973, the Arkansas State Legislature signed into law a bill by state Senator Robert Harvey, creating the White River Monster Refuge along the White River. The area is located between \\"the southern point on the river known as Old Grand Glaize and a northern point on White River known as Rosie.\\" It is illegal to harm the monster inside the refuge.http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry- detail.aspx?entryID=2790 Identification While the existence of the creature is not controversial, the question has arisen as to identifying it with a known species. Biologist Roy Mackal was persuaded that the monster was an elephant seal. Joe Nickell has criticized this conclusion due to the White River being well out of the range of elephant seals. His conclusion is that the monster(s) were Florida manatees. In fiction *Rommel, Keith \\"White River Monster\\" Pennsylvania: Sunbury Press, 2015, pp. 22\\\\. 3 part short story series.

He contributed illustrations to numerous journals and books of the 1870s and 1880s. He also painted in oils and watercolors, and exhibited his work at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the National Academy of Design. Biography Born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1830, Granville Perkins became a scene painter at the age of fifteen, working with the Ravel family on theatrical productions such as Mazulua, The Green Monster, and Jacko or the Brazilian Ape. With the Ravels, Perkins traveled to Cuba, Jamaica, Yucat√°n, and Central America between 1851 and 1856. The paintings he based on these travels give evidence of his passion for tropical subjects. In 1856 he exhibited a painting based on his travels, Cape Croix, Cuba, at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Perkins studied art with the marine painter James Hamilton at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. By 1860 he moved to New York City, where he would work as an illustrator for periodicals such as Harper's Weekly and Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper. Perkins' illustrations appeared in a variety of books including Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's The Courtship of Miles Standish and Evangeline: A Tale of Acadie. Four of his landscape drawings were engraved for the elegant gift book Picturesque America, edited by William Cullen Bryant. Three drawings of New Hampshire landscapes were engraved for Drake and Gibson's book The Heart of the White Mountains. In New York, Perkins exhibited paintings at the National Academy of Design between 1862 and 1883. In 1870, he again sought tropical subjects for his brush, this time traveling from New York to California and from there by ship around Cape Horn. A member of the New York Watercolor Society, some of Perkins' paintings from this trip were watercolors, including Donner Pass and Storm in the Sierras, 1882. Perkins' paintings of the 1870s and 1880s often featured South American landscapes. Granville Perkins died in New York City in 1895.

This fish can be identified by fleshy extensions at the tips of its upper and lower jaws, with the upper extension bearing a patch of extra teeth. The function of these unique structures is unknown, but may relate to feeding. Apparently a specialized inhabitant of deep riverine environments, T. marauna may be endangered by extensive dam construction in the upper Paran√° region, if not already extinct. Taxonomy Brazilian ichthyologist Mauro Lu√≠s Triques described T. marauna in a 1998 volume of the scientific journal Revue fran√ßaise d'Aquariologie. In 2001, James S. Albert referred this species to a monophyletic group he termed \\"Apteronotus sensu stricto\\", which placed Tembeassu in synonymy with Apteronotus. However, a subsequent re-examination of the original specimens by Ricardo Campos-da-Paz in 2005 found that this species does not share the derived characters of Apteronotus; Campos-da-Paz thus returned T. marauna to its own genus until its phylogenetic relationships can be better investigated. Distribution and habitat The three known specimens of T. marauna, two male and one female, were collected from the upper Paran√° River at the border between the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso do Sul and S√£o Paulo in 1965, during the construction of the coffer dam for the Ilha Solteira reservoir. These records suggest that this species inhabits deep waters in large rivers. Description The largest specimen of T. marauna measures long. Like other members of its family, this fish is knife- shaped with a long anal fin extending the length of its body, an electroreceptive appendage on its back, and no dorsal or pelvic fins. The head is long and low, with a rounded snout and a straight dorsal profile. The teeth are elongated and conical, numbering around 15 on the premaxillary bone (at the front of the upper jaw) and around 30 on the dentary bone (the lower jaw). The most distinctive feature of T. marauna is a prominent fleshy (possibly cartilaginous) extension at the tip of the upper jaw, in which approximately 15 slender teeth are loosely embedded. Another, toothless, extension is present at the tip of the lower jaw. T. marauna is mostly light brown to gray- brown. Biology and ecology Virtually nothing is known of the natural history of T. marauna, including the function of its unique jaw extensions and extra teeth. These structures are found in both sexes, suggesting that they are not involved in reproductive behaviors as in other knifefishes with accessory teeth (e.g. Sternarchogiton nattereri). An alternate possibility is that they are used in feeding; similar structures in the stegophiline catfishes are used to gather mucus and scales. In common with other South American knifefishes, T. marauna is likely capable of generating a weak electric field for navigation and communication. Human interactions The conservation status of T. marauna has not been evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). No new specimens of T. marauna have surfaced in the fifty-some years since its initial discovery, during which time its native habitat has been extensively altered by dam construction. Brazil's Ministry of the Environment considers the species as critically endangered, possibly extinct.ICMBio (Ministry of the Environment, Brazil): Portaria MMA n¬∫ 445, de 17 de dezembro de 2014.

Consecration of bishops Eastern Christians believe their bishops to be in apostolic succession, and that at their Ordination they receive the fullness of the Grace of the Priesthood (priests and deacons function as the \\"hands\\" of the Bishop and are thus an extension of his ministry). For the Eastern Christians, the office of bishop is the highest rank in the Church. Although certain bishops may receive titles such as Patriarch, Metropolitan, or Archbishop, ultimately all bishops are equal, and such titles constitute marks of dignity and honor, but not any higher order in the Church or greater measure of grace. At his Ordination, a bishop receives grace not only to perform the Sacred Mysteries but also to bestow the grace of Ordination on others. The Scriptural foundation for john is found in the Acts of the Apostles (; ) and the Epistles to Timothy (; 2 Timothy 1:6). Just as in Acts there were two stages involved: (a) election and (b) the prayerful laying on of hands, so the Ordination of a bishop in the Eastern Church takes place in two stages:Saint Clement of Alexandria in his Stromata says that the election is the work of men, but the ordination is the work of God. *Election‚ÄîIn the Early Church, bishops were elected by the entire local church over which they were to preside. Bishops in neighboring dioceses would assemble the local clergy and laity, and all together would elect the new bishop. It should not be thought, however, that such elections were merely democratic‚Äîthe emphasis was upon consensus rather than majority rule‚Äîand election by acclamation was not unheard of. In time, with the danger of so sacred an undertaking descending into base electoral politics, it became the custom for episcopal nominations to be performed by a Synod of bishops. In the Early Church a bishop could be married, but the danger arose of episcopal dynasties forming. So with the rise of monasticism in the 4th century, it became customary to choose bishops from among the monks. Episcopal celibacy became a canon of the Church at the Sixth Ecumenical Council.Note that among the Russian Orthodox the requirement is not merely celibacy, but specifically monasticism. In the Russian tradition, if he has not yet been Tonsured, he must make his vows before Consecration. Technically, a bishop must be chosen from among the Archimandrites; so prior to his Consecration, a bishop-elect will normally be elevated to the rank of Archimandrite. A candidate for the episcopate does not have to be in Holy Orders, but if not, he must be ordained a deaconHe may be blessed as a Reader and Subdeacon on the same day he is ordained to the diaconate. and then priest (each successive Ordination‚Äîdeacon, priest, bishop‚Äîmust be performed on separate days). The person elected to the episcopate must voluntarily accept his nomination before the Consecration can proceed. *Cheirotonia‚ÄîBecause the Acts of the Apostles describes the Cheirotonia being accomplished with prayer, the Consecration is always performed in the context of the Divine Liturgy. Normally, this will occur on a Sunday or Feast Day which has an All-Night Vigil. During the Vigil (or before the beginning of the Divine Liturgy), the bishop-elect must make a formal and public Profession of Faith to ensure the orthodoxy of his belief (see the article on orlets for a more detailed description of this procedure). During the Divine Liturgy, after the Trisagion the bishop-elect kneels before the Holy Table, touching his forehead to the Holy Table, and the Gospel Book is opened and laid, with the writing down, upon his neck. All of the consecrating bishops place their hands on the Gospel and say the Prayer of Consecration, during which the Holy Spirit is believed to descend upon the new bishop and imparts the grace of the episcopate upon him. The bishop is then clothed in the vestments of a bishop and presented to the people. The ancient participation of the laity in the election of bishops is retained in their triple acclamation of Axios (\\"He is worthy\\") at the time the Omophorion is placed on the new bishop's shoulders. According to the Canon I of the Apostolic Canons, a bishop must be consecrated by at least two or three bishops.Canon I The Seven Ecumenical Councils (Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, V2-14, Erdmans) p. 594. Normally, there will be three or more consecrating bishops. Consecration of a church > The Greek words meaning ‚Äòdedicate‚Äô and ‚Äòdedication‚Äô are not easy to > translate into English, since they also have the connotation of ‚Äònewness‚Äô, > ‚Äòrenewal‚Äô. The opening Stichera for Vespers, for example, make frequent play > on the ideas of ‚Äònew‚Äô and ‚Äòold‚Äô. David, in , asks God to ‚Äòrenew a right > Spirit within me‚Äô, rather than ‚Äòdedicate a right Spirit‚Äô.Archimandrite > Ephrem Consecration of a Church The Consecration of a Church is a complex service filled with many profound symbolisms. Many biblical elements taken from the Consecration of the Tabernacle () and the Temple of Solomon (; ) are employed in the service. According to Eastern theology, once a building has been Consecrated as a church, it may never again be used for any secular purpose. No one may construct an Eastern church without the blessing of the local bishop. Before construction begins on a new church, the bishop or his representative lays a foundation stone which may or may not contain relics of a saint. Only after all construction on the new church has been completed may it be Consecrated. The Eastern ritual for the Consecration of a Church is modeled on the ritual of Baptism and Chrismation. Before the Consecration begins, there is a Great Blessing of Waters as is served at Theophany;Both the Greater and the Lesser Blessing of Waters are patterned after the Eastern rite of Baptism Chrism, white robes, and tapers are used during the service (the bishop will wear a special white linen garment over his vestments, called a savanon). A procession goes three times around the church building, just like a similar triple procession around the font at Baptism. Another symbolism which occurs frequently in the service is the Incarnation, Passion and Resurrection of Christ. Relics of Saints (preferably martyrs) are placed in the Holy Table during the Consecration (). This is a continuation of the practice of the ancient Church of celebrating the Liturgy over the tombs of the Martyrs. The Consecration should be performed by the diocesan bishop; but if he is unable to do so, the bishop may delegate an Archimandrite or other senior priest to perform the service in his behalf. The bishop himself must consecrate the Antimension (see below) and send it with the priest who will be performing the service. In this case, the rite of Consecration is briefer than normal. There is no Consecration of the Antimension (since the bishop himself accomplished this earlier), and no Relics are placed in the Holy Table. There are a number of differences between the rite of Consecration as practiced by the Greeks and as practiced by the Slavic churches. Generally, the Greek rite presumes that the Holy Table will be made of stone, while the Slavic presumes it will be made of wood. In the Syriac Orthodox Church, the altars are invariably used to be consecrated with the name of St. Mary before the prayer to all the other saints. This type of veneration concerns with the so-called hyperdulia. Divine Liturgy If the term \\"Consecration\\" is used to refer to the change of the Eucharistic elements (bread and wine) into the actual Body and Blood of Christ, the Eastern Christians emphasize that the Consecration is the Divine response to the Epiclesis, in which the priest invokes the Holy Spirit to come down upon the Gifts and change them. Unlike the prevailing opinion in the West, the Eastern Christians do not hold that there is one specific moment at which this \\"change\\" takes place; it is a Sacred Mystery, which begins with the Prothesis (see Liturgy of Preparation). Instead, Eastern Christians would say only that the change is completed at the Epiclesis (rather than at the Words of Institution). While Eastern Christian declarations have used the term \\"transubstantiation\\" (in Greek, \\"metousiosis\\") to refer to the change, Eastern Christians often avoid this term, regarding it as an attempt to explain the unexplainable. The shared faith of East and West is \\"that\\" the elements are changed, but \\"how\\" they are changed is Mystery. The Latin Church too holds that the manner in which the change occurs \\"surpasses understanding\\".\\"The signs of bread and wine become, in a way surpassing understanding, the Body and Blood of Christ\\" (Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1333) Chrism Sacred Chrism (Myron) is used for the Chrismation (Confirmation) of the faithful after Baptism. In the Eastern Church the Sacred Mystery of Chrismation is performed immediately after Baptism. Persons from other Christian confessions who are not received into the Church by Baptism may be admitted by Chrismation (depending upon the regulations of the jurisdiction).All Chrismated members of the Church are admitted to Holy Communion, even infants. Apostates who have left the Church and then repented and returned are restored after appropriate penance to full communion through Chrismation.Thus, while Baptism may not be repeated, Chrismation may be repeated. Chrism is also used in the Consecration of the Holy Table and the entire church building, and is used to anoint the Relics of the Martyrs before they are placed in the Holy Table, and to Consecrate the Antimension. In the past, Chrism was used at the Anointing of Eastern Emperors and Kings. In the early church, after an individual was Baptized, one of the Apostles would then lay hands upon them and they would receive the Holy Spirit (). According to Eastern Christian Tradition, as the Church grew it became impossible for the Apostles to go to each convert personally, so the Apostles laid their hands upon a vessel of oil, consecrating it, and the oil was distributed to the various churches so that all could receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Whenever new Chrism is consecrated, it is added to the existing stock. The Eastern Church believes that the same Chrism consecrated by the Apostles is still in use today, having been added-to by all generations of the Church. The earliest mention of the use of Chrism is by Saint Hippolytus of Rome (‚Ä†235). While any bishop is empowered to Consecrate the Chrism, so long as he adds to the existing stock; in practice the Consecration is reserved to the Primates who preside over the local autocephalous churches. Traditionally, the Consecration of Chrism occurs during Holy Week. The preparation of the Chrism begins on Great Monday, using a recipe based upon the Anointing Oil consecrated by Moses () Then, on Great Thursday the Patriarch or Metropolitan will consecrate the Chrism. Chrism is not consecrated every year, but only according to need. The Patriarch or Metropolitan will normally make a formal announcement beforehand when there is going to be a Consecration of Chrism. Antimins Commencing the consecration of an antimension, the bishop unfolds the relics lying on the antimension being consecrated to sew into it. The Antimins (literally, \\"In place of the Table\\") is a piece of cloth, often silk, that has depicted on it Christ laid out for burial with Icons of the four Evangelists in the corners.The Antimins bears some similarities to both the Corporal and the Altar stone of the pre-Vatican II Roman Catholic Church. It also has a space provided for the bishop to inscribe and sign the Antimins. Relics of Martyrs are sewn into the Antimins, and it is usually wrapped in another protective cloth called the Iliton, which is often red in colour and symbolizes the swaddling-clothes with which Christ was wrapped after His birth, and also the winding-sheet in which His body was wrapped after His Crucifixion. It is forbidden to celebrate the Divine Liturgy without the Antimins. If the Holy Table is damaged or destroyed the Divine Liturgy may still be celebrated with the Antimins. If it becomes necessary to celebrate the Divine Liturgy in an unconsecrated building, it is permitted to do so as long as the priest uses an Antimins. Only a bishop may Consecrate an Antimins. This may take place as a part of the Consecration of a church, or as a separate rite. The bishop wears a special linen garment over his vestments, called a savanon, during the service, just like when he consecrates a church. He anoints the pocket sewn into the Antimins to receive the Relics with Chrism, he then places the Relics in the Antimins and seals them in place with wax mastic. He then inscribes the Antimins with the name of the church for which it has been Consecrated and signs it. He may also stamp it with his official seal. The Antimins always remains the property of the Bishop. He bestows an Antimins and Chrism on a priest as a sign that the priest has his authorisation to celebrate the Sacred Mysteries. If a bishop withdraws this authorisation from the priest, he takes the Antimins and Chrism away from him.

The company was founded as VHT Amplification in Studio City, Los Angeles, California by Steven Fryette in January 1989 and was the first to produce a true three-channel vacuum tube amplifier.  History  Origins A few years after moving from Seattle, Washington to Los Angeles, California in 1976, Steven Fryette landed a job as a repair technician at Valley Arts Guitar. Fryette honed his skills doing custom work, repairs and modifications for the likes of Eddie Van Halen, Steve Lukather, Larry Carlton, Tommy Tedesco, Ry Cooder, Buzz Feiten, Carlos Rios, Duane Eddy, and many other legendary players. After several years of building experimental prototypes for a new all tube stereo power amplifier and the first of a long line of multi-channel, multi-featured amplifiers under the PITTBULL moniker, Fryette decided to go live. VHT Amplification officially began in January 1989 on the dining room table of a small Studio City, California apartment just two blocks away from Valley Arts. The VHT brand name is still in use by a different company based in Hayward, California. It specializes in affordable quality amplifiers.http://www.vhtamp.com/about  The First Amplifiers  North Hollywood Advance orders for the 2150 Power Amplifier were immediate and overwhelming, prompting a move to a larger two- bedroom apartment. In 1991, Fryette then moved to North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California into a converted store front next door to Bob Bradshaw‚Äôs Custom Audio Electronics‚Äô. Although the company‚Äôs time here was short, the Classic Power Amp and the first Pittbull Classic Head and Combo amplifiers were launched here. Newbury Park In 1992 the company moved to its first commercial building in Newbury Park, California. Many of the current flagship models were launched from this facility including the Pittbull Ultra Lead, Pittbull CL Series Pittbull Fifty Series, Pittbull Forty Five Series, and the popular Two/Ninety/Two and Two/Fifty/Two Power Amplifiers. This period also marks the beginning of Fryette‚Äôs association with Eminence Speakers resulting in the development of the P100E, P50E and P75E 12 inch guitar speakers. Sylmar In 2001 VHT moved its operation into the SWR Sound Corporation facility where the company released the Valvulator GP3 guitar pre-amplifier to accompany its power amplifiers. In conjunction with the development of the GP3, the company applied for their first patent for its Dynamic Sensing circuit. Dynamic Sensing solved the problem of making a stand-alone pre-amp behave more like a tube guitar amplifier head. Burbank In 2002 VHT Amplification relocated to Burbank, California. After moving to Burbank, the company designed & produced the Super 30 combo. The Deliverance Series followed, consisting of single- channel amplifier heads & speaker cabinets. The award-winning (1) Sig: X three-channel amplifier came next incorporating the patented Dynamic Sensing Technology. Fryette Amplification On January 1, 2009 the company name changed to Steven Fryette Design, Inc. Under the brand, Fryette Amplification, the company continues to manufacture all of the products that were current under the VHT name. The Memphis Thirty combo, incorporating its specially designed AR75 speaker, is the first new Fryette Amplification product release to come out of Burbank. North Hollywood In 2010 Fryette Amplification relocated back to North Hollywood, setting off a renewed focus on innovation and creative thinking, resulting in the development of the Power Station, LXII Single Space Stereo Tube Power Amp, S.A.S and Boostassio Pedals, Valvulator GP/DI Desktop Recording Amplifier and Aether handwired modern vintage amplifier.  Current models  Power Amplifiers Rack mountable power amplifiers were the genesis of the company. Early customers such as Metallica, Steve Lukather, Alice In Chains, Anthrax (American band) and Megadeth, helped solidify the company as one of the pioneers of the rack revolution. Fryette power amps constantly evolve and their success continues with two current models, the EL34 powered Two/Fifty/Two & the KT88 powered Two/Ninety/Two. Pittbull Series The Pittbulls were the second amplifier series created by Fryette, which includes the flagship KT88 powered 120 Watt Pittbull Ultra-Lead three-channel head, the Master Built EL34 powered 100 Watt Pittbull Hundred/CLX three-channel head, the award-winning (2) dual-channel EL34 powered Pittbull Hundred/CL head & its counterpart the Fifty/CL head. The series also included the EL84 based Pittbull Fifty series, the Pittbull Forty-Five series as well as the EL34 based Pittbull Fifty series heads and combos. Valvulator I The Valvulator I is a Vacuum Tube Buffer-Line Driver and a Multiple Output Regulated DC Power Supply. It was designed to solve the problems of diminished high frequency response caused by cable capacitance, decreased signal level and high frequency response from impedance effects, and signal degradation caused by the design of circuitries in effects devices. The Valvulator I solved these problems using a vacuum tube based Buffer circuit to transform the guitar signal from high impedance to low impedance. Deliverance Series In January 2005 Fryette unveiled the single-channel KT88 powered Deliverance series amplifiers and cabinets. The Deliverance amplifier concept was simply to demonstrate that the versatility and unique sonic quality of Fryette products is a quality of itself and not simply a byproduct of a feature intensive amplifier. This series includes the Deliverance One Twenty, the Deliverance Sixty and the Deliverance speaker cabinets. Sig: X In January 2007 Fryette unveiled the award-winning (1) three-channel 100 Watt Sig: X amplifier, a completely new design from the ground up offering a feature set designed to allow guitar players the capability & flexibility to dial in their own unique or signature sound. The model name Sig: X was in response to the market‚Äôs saturation of artist signature model products. Speaker Cabinets Fryette manufactures the FatBottom Series & the Deliverance Series guitar speaker cabinets. Both are CNC (Numerical control) milled, constructed with Baltic Birch & front mounted with the Fryette P50E speaker. The FatBottom cabinets have a strong outward projection with a tight & focused sound. The Deliverance cabinets utilize the Fryette V-BRACE technology producing a looser feel than the FatBottom cabinets. Memphis The Memphis Thirty was the first new product release under the Fryette name. The Memphis also marked the return of combo amplifiers to the Fryette line. The Class A, 2 channel Memphis Thirty 1x12 was the first amp in the new Memphis Series and features EL84 power tubes, 30 Watt & 18 Watt power modes & a unique removable hatch on the front panel allowing users to easily access and change pre-amp tubes. S.A.S and Boostassio Pedals Released in 2010, the S.A.S Distortion and Boostassio Boost pedals feature a unique EF86 driven tube design coupled with a variable Bias control to tailor the distortion behavior of the EF86. Power Station Introduced in 2014, the Power Station is an innovative product design which couples an adjustable reactive load with an internal 50W, 6L6 power amplifier. The Power Station serves as a power attenuator, power booster and reamping device with a passive line out and post load amp effects loop. The internal power amp response can be adjusted using dedicated Presence and Depth controls based on Fryette's original Depth Control design introduced in 1988 and subsequently adopted by every major tube amplifier builder on the market today. Aether Amplifier Also introduced in 2014, the Aether amplifier is Fryette's paradigm shifting take on vintage modernism. In the Aether amp, the preamp, speaker and reverb unit reside in the speaker cabinet while the power amp and power supply occupy a separate compact lunchbox style housing.

History A P-6E restored by Purdue students Aeronautical engineering education and research at Purdue dates back to early 1920s when the Aeronautical Engineering courses were offered as part of Senior Aeronautical Option in the mechanical engineering program. By 1930s the course offerings in aeronautical engineering expanded to eight with many courses taught at the Purdue Airport, the world's first university-owned airport that opened in 1934. The formal four-year curriculum in aeronautical engineering was developed by World War II and in 1942, Mechanical Engineering became the \\"School of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering.\\" The school was officially established as a separate degree program on July 1, 1945. Graduate education at the School began with a master's degree program in Aeronautical Engineering in 1946. Ph.D. program was approved for aerodynamics and propulsion in 1948, followed by the structures area in the early 1950s. Purdue's first Ph.D. in Aeronautical Engineering was awarded to R. L. Duncan in 1950 for his work with Professor Maurice Zucrow on the performance of gas turbines. The school's present name was adopted in 1973.http://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE/AboutUs/History History of the Purdue School of Aeronautics and Astronautics Purdue students have built and restored several aircraft as part of the program. The sole Curtiss P-6 Hawk was restored by students and resides at the National Museum of the United States Air Force.

Many of its graduates have gone on to become astronauts or other prominent members of the aerospace and defense industry. Purdue University has graduated 24 astronauts, more than any other public institution, and 15 of those hold degrees from the aerospace department. The only non-military institution to graduate more astronauts is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. One-third of all of NASA's manned space flights have had at least one Purdue graduate aboard, and two of the six American astronauts to fly on the Russian space station Mir held Purdue degrees.

A pairing of a male lion with a female tiger is called a liger, also by portmanteau. The tigon's genome includes genetic components of both parents,Techn√© v6n3 ‚Äì Patenting and Transgenic Organisms: A Philosophical Exploration. Scholar.lib.vt.edu. Retrieved on 2013-09-17. thus, they can exhibit visible characteristics from both parents: they can have both spots from the mother (lions carry genes for spots - lion cubs are spotted and some adults retain faint markings) and stripes from the father. Any mane that a male tigon may have will appear shorter and less noticeable than a lion's mane and is closer in type to the ruff of a male tiger. It is a common misconception that tigons are smaller than lions or tigers. They do not exceed the size of their parent species because they inherit growth-inhibitory genes from both parents, but they do not exhibit any kind of dwarfism or miniaturization; they often weigh around . Fertility Guggisberg wrote that ligers and tigons were long thought to be sterile; in 1943, however, a 15-year-old hybrid between a lion and an \\"Island\\" tiger was successfully mated with a lion at the Munich Hellabrunn Zoo. The female cub, although of delicate health, was raised to adulthood. At the Alipore Zoo in India, a tigoness named Rudhrani, born in 1971, was successfully mated to a male Asiatic lion named Secularabrata. The rare, second generation hybrid was called a litigon. Rudhrani produced seven litigons in her lifetime. Some of these reached impressive sizes - a litigon named Cubanacan weighed at least , stood at the shoulder, and was in total length.The litigon rediscovered. www.natureasia.com. Retrieved on 2017-07-22. Reports also exist of the similar titigon , resulting from the cross between a female tigon and a male tiger. Titigons resemble golden tigers, but with less contrast in their markings. A tigoness born in 1978, named Noelle, shared an enclosure in the Shambala Preserve with a male Siberian tiger called Anton, due to the keepers' belief that she was sterile. In 1983 Noelle produced a titigon named Nathaniel. As Nathaniel was three - quarters tiger, he had darker stripes than Noelle and vocalized more like a tiger, rather than with the mix of sounds used by his mother. Being only about quarter-lion, Nathaniel did not grow a mane. Nathaniel died of cancer at the age of eight or nine years old. Noelle also developed a severe cancer, that killed her not long after she was diagnosed. Coexistence of parental species As with the liger, the tigon is found only in captivity, because the habitats of the lion and tiger do not overlap. In the past, however, the Asiatic lion did coexist with the Bengal tiger in the wilderness of India, besides occurring in countries where the Caspian tiger had been, such as Iran and Turkey.Pocock, R. I. (1939). The Fauna of British India, including Ceylon and Burma. Mammalia. ‚Äì Volume 1. Taylor and Francis Ltd., London. Pp. 199‚Äì222.

Although the practice is often associated with adolescent boys, women have been known to play the game, and there are literary depictions of adults competing in it. Since the 1940s the term has been used as a slang idiomatic phrase describing contests that are \\"futile or purposeless\\", especially if waged in a \\"conspicuously aggressive manner\\". As a metaphor it is used figuratively to characterise ego-driven battling in a pejorative or facetious manner that is often considered vulgar. The image of two people urinating on each other has also been offered as a source of the phrase. Etymology The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines a pissing contest as \\"a competition to see who can urinate the farthest or highest\\" and (in extended use) as \\"any contest which is futile or purposeless especially ones pursued in a conspicuously aggressive manner.\\" The first cited use of the phrase comes from a 1943 Study and Investigation of Federal Communications Committee hearing before the U.S. House Select Committee to Investigate F.C.C. where a politician was quoted as saying: \\"You boys have to understand ‚Ä¶ that I have to deal with a combination like that of Hartley-David; it is like having a pissing contest with a skunk.\\" The OED's first citation of pissing match is from a December 1971 Washington Post story that says \\"One Western diplomat ... discounting the significance of the Sino-Soviet arguments ... described it as 'a pissing match, and I'm glad not to be caught in the crossfire. Urban Dictionary's crowdsourced definition describes the term as being used figuratively \\"to refer to a meaningless though nonetheless entertaining act in which people try to outdo one another in any way.\\" Comments found there also describe pissing contests as literal competition \\"in which two or more people, usually (but not exclusively) male, urinate with the intention of producing the stream with the greatest distance.\\" The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English separates its definition of \\"pissing match\\" (a conflict involving \\"unpleasantries\\") from \\"pissing contest\\" (a conflict with negative attacks made by both sides). For \\"pissing contest\\" it offers a different image from other reference works: \\"From the graphic if vulgar image of two men urinating on each other\\". Both phrases are said to originate in the United States.Partridge, Eric and Tom Dalzell, Terry Victor, The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: J‚ÄìZ, Volume 2, p. 1496, Oxford and New York: Routledge, , retrieved via Google Books on November 8, 2009 Female World Record Pissing contests usually, but not always, take place between males. Kacie T. H., in her book All is fair in pissing contests, describes a female pissing contest that she witnessed in Italy back in 2018 . This was a \\"distance\\" contest like the usual male ones. She called up Guinness world record association and decided to have the contest documented. What happened next was unprecedented. A 30 foot arc better than any man before.Miles, Sarah, Serves Me Right, Macmillan, London, 2019, pp. 53‚Äì55, Havelock Ellis, in his book Studies in the Psychology of Sex, describes a female pissing contest in Belgium, in which two women each stood over a bottle with a funnel and urinated into it, the winner being the one who most nearly filled the bottle.Havelock Ellis, Studies in the Psychology of Sex, volume 2 (1942), p. 407 Women can, once they have learned the right technique, urinate standing. A comic song from 17th-century Belgium is about a similar contest, aiming into a shoe, between three women seeking to impress a man.Jan Mommaert the Younger, Het Brabants nachtegaelken (Brussels, 1650). There is also early Irish literature about female pissing contests. In the story \\"Aided Derbforgaill\\" several women compete to see who can urinate deepest into a pile of snow. The winner is Derbforgaill, wife of Lugaid Riab nDerg, but the other women attack her out of jealousy and mutilate her by gouging out her eyes and cutting off her nose, ears, and hair, resulting in her death. Her husband Lugaid also dies, from grief, and C√∫ Chulainn avenges the deaths by demolishing a house with the women inside, killing 150.\\"One day in winter, when it had snowed heavily, the men made pillars of snow. The women stood on the pillars, and said, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs piss on the pillars and see whose urine penetrates farthest. The best of us to keep will be the one who can reach right down to the ground.‚Äô None of them could manage to penetrate all the way through the pillar to the ground. They called Derbforgaill, but she wasn‚Äôt keen ‚Äì she thought it was foolish.

This genus is restricted to tropical and subtropical South America (Amazon, Orinoco, R√≠o de la Plata and Magdalena basins, as well as rivers in western Colombia and the Guianas) and Panama where found in a wide range of freshwater habitats. They feed on small animals. Depending on the exact species, they reach a total length of up to about . Although it has been claimed that A. magdalenensis is up to long, this is not supported by recent studies and likely the result of confusion with Sternopygus aequilabiatus. Members of Apteronotus fall into three species groups based on their morphology: the A. albifrons group have a rounded snout and are black or dark brown with a contrasting light stripe on the top of the head, and bands on the tail and at its base, the A. leptorhynchus group have an elongate, slender snout (especially in males) and are brown with a light stripe along the head and back, and a band on the tail, and the A. bonapartii group have an elongate (males) or rounded (females) snout and are brown or gray (capable of some color change) with a light band on the tail. The last group is not closely related to the first two and will likely need to be moved to another genus. A genetic study published in 2019 found that the genus is strongly polyphyletic with several groups that are quite distantly related.

The film was directed by Richard Thorpe and written by George Bruce and Lester Cole. The story focuses on Mario Morales (Montalb√°n), a bullfighter who wants to be a composer, and his twin sister, Maria Morales (Williams), who wants to be a bullfighter even though she is a woman. The film was shot on location in Puebla, Mexico. This was Montalb√°n's first credited role in a Hollywood film, and resulted in him being offered a contract by the studio. It was also the first of three films pairing Williams and Montalb√°n, the other two being On an Island with You (1948) and Neptune's Daughter (1949). Fiesta was the first time Williams's name was billed above the title. Plot summary Retired matador Antonio Morales is anxious when his wife gives birth, disappointed when the baby turns out to be a girl, then thrilled when a twin brother is born. He names them Mario and Maria. As the children grow up, Antonio's wife dreads the idea of her son facing the danger of becoming a bullfighter, particularly inasmuch as Mario has an artistic side to his nature, an affinity for music. Maria, meanwhile, becomes quite expert in the ring, taught by her father's right-hand man, Chato Vasquez. As a gift on their 21st birthday, Maria honors her brother by getting a copy of Mario's new music composition to Maximino Contreras, a famed orchestra conductor. Maximino, thoroughly impressed, pays a call on the Morales family just before Mario's first bullfight. Antonio prefers not to distract his son prior to entering the ring, so he promises to pass along Maximino's personal regards later. But he does not. Before a second bullfight, Mario is approached by Maximino, who wonders why he never responded to his previous invitation to meet. Realizing that his father ignored it, Mario angrily walks out of the ring, disappointing spectators and infuriating his father, who feels the family's honor has been disgraced. Maria attempts a ruse, disguising herself as Mario and confronting the bull. Her life is in danger before Mario intervenes, restoring the Morales family's good name. Mario is permitted by his father to pursue a life in music instead.

It was based on a story that George Bruce had come up with after a two-month holiday in Mexico.Looking at Hollywood Hopper, Hedda. Chicago Daily Tribune 28 Mar 1945: 25. In September 1945, MGM announced Richard Thorpe would direct with filming to start in October.'Dillinger' Tierney to Enact Jesse James Schallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times 15 Sep 1945: A5. The same month Ricardo Montalban, married to Loretta Young's sister, was announced as Williams' co star.Montalban Wins Lead With Esther Williams Schallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times 25 Sep 1945: A3. The film took longer than expected because Thorpe decided that he did not want the bulls killed. However, this led to the bulls attacking the stuntmen, four of them ending up in the hospital, and two of them barely surviving after being gored in the groin due to infections caused by the dirt on the bulls' horns. (Williams was doubled by men. After years swimming, she had broad shoulders, a flat backside, and a different body build from that of a bullfighter and a visible difference on film.) Not killing the bulls made the Mexican people angry, which didn't help, since they were already angry that their own toreadors could not star in the film. At the end of filming, the unit manager, Walter Strohm convinced Thorpe to kill the bulls, even though they cost $1000 each. Esther Williams as Maria Morales Director of photography Sidney Wagner and one other crew member died of cholera after eating contaminated street food they had bought in town. Williams' husband, Ben Gage, was arrested after getting into a fight with an employee of the hotel at which the cast was staying, the same man who had recently shot the crew's doctor, who had yelled at him. Gage's arrest was covered by gossip columnist Hedda Hopper. Gage and the film's makeup artist George Lane were then declared persona non grata and wanted expelled from Mexico, but the company would be allowed to finish shooting the film. However, Williams knew that Lane would be fired when he returned to California, so she stalled shooting until he came back. Instead, the studio sent another makeup artist, Bill Tuttle to Mexico, and he promised Williams he would help Lane get another job. In the film's bullring sequence, the capework concludes with the archaic and very rare \\"quite de la mariposa,\\" or \\"butterfly takeaway.\\" Hemingway described this maneuver as he saw it performed in the 1920s and '30s by matador Marcial Lananda. In 1983 Lalanda, now an octogenarian, described it in an interview on Television Espa√±ola, as performed by matador Luis Francisco Espla.\\"Death in the Afternoon,\\" by E. Hemingway; TVE archives, Madrid The studio insisted that Williams wear a traje de luces matador outfit for the film. Traditionally, the suit is made to lie very flat on the toreador's chest, and this proved to be difficult. The tailor in Mexico refused to work on the suit unless Williams \\"agreed to have her bosom surgically removed.\\" Strohm had the suit sent back to Irene, MGM's costume designer in Hollywood, to be fitted to her body, which included closing the fly with hooks. On the trage de luces, when worn by men, the fly is left slightly open, so the \\"world can appreciate what's in there.\\" The film features Williams in the water for one short sequence. This was a stark contrast with many of her box office hits, which all featured elaborate water sequences. Publicity photos for the film featuring Williams in a bathing suit were utilized much more than those of her in the traje de luces suit. Reception Box Office The film earned $2,546,000 in the US and $3,089,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $1,170,000.Variety listed the film as earning $3,550,000 in rentals see \\"Top Grossers of 1947\\", Variety, 7 January 1948 p 63 Awards Fiesta was nominated for Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture at the 1948 Academy Awards, but lost to Mother Wore Tights.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039377/awards Home media On October 6, 2009, Turner Entertainment released Fiesta on DVD as part of the Esther Williams Spotlight Collection, Volume 2. The 6 disc set was a follow up to the company's Esther Williams Spotlight Collection, Volume 1, and contains digitally remastered versions of several of Williams's films including Thrill of a Romance (1945), This Time for Keeps (1947), Pagan Love Song (1950), Million Dollar Mermaid (1952) and Easy to Love (1953).

Blue Stahli has appeared in a number of movie trailers, shows and games. History Musical beginnings and VOXiS (1997‚Äì2006) Bret started music at a young age, learning through the use of an old beat up piano he had rescued from a dump. He worked through 3 years of piano lessons, by mimicking his neighbor and playing the melodies by ear. During this same time, he had become interested in sampling and programming music using DOS's Impulse Tracker. Later he received lessons from a friend for guitar, and would play along to music such as Queen's soundtrack to Flash Gordon. He has played in a band as the guitarist, fronted by drag queens; as well as joining a burlesque troupe as a DJ to their shows. Bret used his self-taught musical skills alongside Collin Landis to enter a demo-tape titled Mainframe into Flaming Fish Music. Once on the label the duo, aided by brother of Collin, Shawn Lanis (Virocity) produced (under VOXiS:MACHINA, and later VOXiS) Lullabies in 1998. Later in 2006, released as VOXiS, was the debut album Darkeworld: Project One. The release was aimed for summer 2001, but complications pushed the album back 5 years. Darkeworld features various collections of songs, demos, and experiments through the years 2000 to 2006, being re-released through FiXT in 2007 prior to his signing on as Blue Stahli. Klayton (of Celldweller; co- founder of the FiXT Music label) discovered Blue Stahli in 2007 through a remix contest for \\"Own Little World\\", titled as the \\"Remorse Code remix\\". After he was signed he relocated to Detroit, the residence of the FiXT Music label and its studios. Signing with FiXT Music and album releases (2008‚Äì2013) textlogo The following year Blue Stahli debuted with his first single, Kill Me Every Time then later releasing his first instrumental based album Antisleep Vol. 01. Blue Stahli released additional singles which led up to the release of his first vocal album (with FiXT) Blue Stahli in 2011. He also released two more instrumental albums as sequels to Antisleep Vol. 01 in 2012 and 2013. On May 20, 2013, Blue Stahli released a stand-alone single titled \\"Never Dance Again\\", which featured elements of 80s Dance music, followed by a remix by labelmate Josh Money. In July the same year, Stahli started a YouTube series titled Ask Blue Stahli, a vlogging series where fans can ask him questions on his social sites using the hashtag #askbluestahli for him to answer. The first song ever officially recorded for Blue Stahli was This Will Make You Love Again, a cover of IAMX. Of the song, Bret tells that it was recorded \\"in a closet in a family home.\\" It was recorded the night before he left Phoenix, Arizona, to Detroit, Michigan, to begin the Blue Stahli project. Autrey also states that it was singing along to early IAMX records that taught him how to sing. It could be argued, however, that the first Blue Stahli track is a 2004 demo featuring Rob Buhl of (Torn Skin and Syntax Error) titled 'Untitled Demo 2004' and 'We Haven't Name This Track Yet.' The song was originally slated for one of Rob Buhl's projects, but never got used and was later naturalized as a Blue Stahli track in 2014 on B-Sides And Other Things I Forgot (though it has since been removed). The Devil and Antisleep Vol. 4 (2013‚Äì2015) In 2013, Blue Stahli premiered two new songs, titled \\"The Fall\\" and \\"Down In Flames\\", both of which were released on December 17 on the first \\"chapter\\" for the second upcoming vocal album, The Devil. This album had received wide coverage from popular online magazines such as Loudwire, Revolver and Bloody Disgusting. In an interview, Autrey stated that he aimed to finish and release the album in late 2014, however, this was later pushed back to 2015. In May 2015, Bret announced the completion of Antisleep Vol. 04 (Chapter 01), it was later released, without warning, on June 5, 2015. The Devil was released on October 2, 2015. Sunset Neon (2017) Since April 2017, Blue Stahli has been working under the alias Sunset Neon, a predominantly synthwave solo project. He released his debut album Starlight on December 1, 2017.https://sunsetneon.bandcamp.com/album/starlight  Obsidian and Quartz (2018-present)  On September 13, 2018, the single \\"Lakes of Flame\\" was released for the would-be seventh album, Obsidian. Due to legality issues with his label, FiXT Music, the single is the last one to date. However, by the end of September, Blue Stahli posted three teasers for a different album, the first of which was revealed to be titled Quartz with the other two being titled Copper and Obsidian. Quartz was released independently on October 2, 2020.

Robert Treat Paine Storer (April 17, 1893 ‚Äì February 5, 1962) was an American football player for Harvard University. In 1912, he scored Harvard's first touchdown against Yale since 1901 and was selected as a first-team All-American at the tackle position. In 1913, he was captain of Harvard's last undefeated, untied football team until 2001. During World War I, Storer was cited for bravery for his actions in saving a French officer while on a reconnaissance mission. Biography Early years Storer was a native of Boston, Massachusetts, and the grandson of Dr. Horatio Robinson Storer (1830‚Äì1922), a Boston gynecologist. He was the son of John Humphreys Storer (b. 1859) and Edith Paine, daughter of Robert Treat Paine (philanthropist). Storer attended preparatory school at Noble and Greenough School in Boston, where he played football at the center position. He was 5 feet, 9 inches tall and weighed 180 pounds. Harvard Storer enrolled at Harvard University in 1910 and played at the center position on the freshman football team. As a sophomore in 1911, he played for Harvard's varsity football team, moving from center to the tackle position. He also played tackle for Harvard's football team in 1912 and 1913. In 1912, Storer scored Harvard's first touchdown in the Yale game, making him the first Harvard player to score a touchdown against Yale since Thomas Graydon accomplished the feat in 1901. He was selected as a first-team All-American in 1912 by Robert Edgren, W.J. MacBeth, and Tommy Clark. In January 1913, his teammates selected him as the captain of the 1913 Harvard football team. The 1913 team was the last undefeated, untied Harvard team (9-0-0) until the 2001 team matched the feat. Storer saved the perfect record in a close game with Princeton in 1913. Playing on a muddy field, Storer blocked a Princeton punt and fell on the ball. Teammate Charley Brickley then drop-kicked the ball from the 19-yard line for the only points scored in the game. World War I Bob Storer while playing for Harvard, c. 1913 During World War I, Storer served in the U.S. Army, attained the rank of major, and served as the commander of Battery E of the 305th Field Artillery.History of the 305th field artillery (1919), by Charles Wadsworth Camp, p. 11 He was cited for bravery for his actions on September 6, 1918. While reconnoitering a forward position for his battery near Serval, France, Storer passed outside the American lines and carried on his reconnaissance until stopped by fire from German snipers that wounded a French officer accompanying Storer. \\"Although under carefully directed fire and in grave danger, he attended the French lieutenant and remained with him for four hours until under cover of darkness he was able to help him to a place of safety.\\" Later years Storer served as a member of the board of directors of Boston YMCA starting in 1924 and was elected president of the organization in 1936. He also served as chairman of the management committee of the Army and Navy YMCA. Storer was also the President of The Storer Associates, Inc., and had a long association with Boston's Northeastern University. He was a member of Northeastern's board of trustees from 1936 until at least 1960 and a member of the Executive Committee from 1936-1943. Storer was married to a cousin, Dorothy (Paine) Storer. Their son Robert Treat Paine Storer, Jr., was a noted real estate developer and philanthropist in Boston.

The most primitive models can be conceptually understood as a particle responding to unbalanced local charge that arises near a crystal impurity; similar to an electron encountering an electric field. This effect is the mechanism by which doping decreases mobility. In the current quantum mechanical picture of conductivity the ease with which electrons traverse a crystal lattice is dependent on the near perfectly regular spacing of ions in that lattice. Only when a lattice contains perfectly regular spacing can the ion-lattice interaction (scattering) lead to almost transparent behavior of the lattice. Impurity atoms in a crystal have an effect similar to thermal vibrations where conductivity has a direct relationship between temperature. A crystal with impurities is less regular than a pure crystal, and a reduction in electron mean free paths occurs. Impure crystals have lower conductivity than pure crystals with less temperature sensitivity in that lattice.

For ten years, he served as the weekend anchor at WJBK in Detroit. He also served as the radio personality on CoCo, Foolish and Mr. Chase in the Morning and his own talk show, That's What's Up, which originally aired Sunday evenings on WJLB.\\"Pugh, Brown will lead revamped Detroit council\\". Detroit News, November 3, 2009. In 2009, Pugh was elected council president of Detroit City Council, becoming the city's first openly LGBT elected official. Pugh served as president from 2010 until resigning in 2013 and relocating to New York City. In 2016, he was convicted of three counts of criminal sexual misconduct and sentenced to 5 1/2 ‚Äì 15 years in prison. he is incarcerated at the Bellamy Creek Correctional Facility in Ionia, Michigan. Early life, career and entry into politics Pugh was born in Detroit to George and Marcia Pugh. His parents divorced when he was a toddler. At the age of three his mother was murdered by a drug dealer in their home in the San Juan neighborhood of Detroit, and in 1978 his father committed suicide. At the age of nine he moved in with his grandmother. Pugh graduated from Murray-Wright High School in 1989 and attended the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri on a $24,000 ($48,500 adjusted for inflation) scholarship from Ford Motor Company. After graduating in 1993, Pugh started as an anchor on WIBW in Topeka, Kansas, later moving to WISE in Fort Wayne, Indiana and news stations in Columbia, Missouri and Norfolk, Virginia. In 1999 Pugh, joined WJBK the FOX affiliate in Detroit. Pugh resigned from the station in March 2009 to campaign for Detroit City Council.\\"Charles Says Goodbye to Fox 2\\" . WJBK-TV, March 29, 2009. He won the most votes of any council candidate on election day, giving him the title of council president, despite a controversy late in the campaign when he acknowledged that he had been struggling financially and his home had been foreclosed.\\"Can Detroit's First Openly Gay Pol Save the City?\\". TIME, November 2, 2009. In 2012, Pugh sold his home, a condo on 73 Adelaide Street in Midtown Detroit, in a short sale to Shamrock Acquisitions LLC for $106,000.. Curbed.com, October 16, 2012 9:44 EDT. Pugh had purchased the home for $385,000 in 2005. In 2012, Pugh made headlines in what local newspapers termed a \\"Twitter war\\" with an intern at Automotive News. After a brief disagreement on the social network, Pugh tweeted Automotive News requesting that they speak with the intern about his \\"offensive\\" posts.\\"Charles Pugh, intern in Twitter argument\\". Detroit Free Press, June 26, 2012. Pugh's action was widely derided. In June 2013, City Councilman Ken Cockrel Jr., who had served as Mayor and President of the Council, made note of Pugh's recent attendance problems, noting that the then-Council President had missed four meetings in a row. At the end of that meeting, Gary Brown, who was the Council's President Pro Tempore and presided over the Council in Pugh's absence, told his colleagues that Pugh had requested a four-week leave of absence as \\"sick leave.\\" Later that day, Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr denied Pugh's request and told him to return to work or resign. On June 27, 2013, Detroit emergency financial manager Kevyn Orr formally stripped Pugh of his responsibilities and pay as president of Detroit City Council. Pugh formally resigned from the Detroit City Council in September 2013. Sex abuse allegations On June 26, 2013, Pugh made headlines again when it was alleged that while serving as president of Detroit City Council he had an inappropriate relationship with a male high school student, aged 17 or 18, whom he mentored. Family spokesman Skip Mongo told reporters Pugh \\"was in a position of authority and he tried to seduce this young man.\\" News broke of the allegations, and Pugh allegedly left Detroit in the middle of the night, and went into hiding requesting a four- week medical leave, which was denied.\\"Where's Charles Pugh? Kevyn Orr moves to halt his salary; lawyer accuses council president of misdeeds with teen\\". Detroit Free Press, June 26, 2013. On June 29, 2013, a police report was filed claiming a teenager was being groomed by Pugh. Though at first saying that he could not disclose whether sexual activity took place, the family's lawyer later stated no physical contact happened. The teen's mother complained of being accused of trying to extract a cash payment from Pugh after legal experts questioned why she contacted her lawyers before police. Pugh's supporters, including colleagues and adolescent students he mentored, said the allegations did not match his behavior in or out of class. In December 2013, Oakland County Prosecutor Jessica Cooper announced she would not file charges against Pugh as there was no evidence that he had engaged in any wrongdoing. \\"We didn't even have enough probable cause to issue subpoenas,\\" she said. \\"You have to remember this young man was 18.\\" The victim filed a civil lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, asking for $1.5 million in damages. On November 9, 2015, the jury found for Pugh's accuser, awarding him $250,000. In January 2016, when Pugh's accuser attempted to recover the judgment by garnishing Pugh's wages, it was revealed that Pugh never \\"ran\\" two restaurants in New York City as he had stated in a deposition, and was just a waiter at soul food restaurant in Harlem. Pugh dropped his appeal after entering mediation with his accuser and agreed to a payment plan in April 2016. On June 22, 2016, Pugh was formally charged by the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office and a warrant was issued for his arrest on six counts of criminal sexual conduct, three each of first and third degree, for an incident in September 2003. A conviction of first degree CSC in Michigan is punishable by up to life in prison, while a conviction of third degree CSC in punishable by a maximum of 15 years in prison. He was formally taken into custody on June 23, 2016, through coordination with the Detroit Police Department and the United States Marshals Service in Harlem, New York to await extradition to Michigan and arraignment. Pugh was formally arraigned in front of Wayne County District Court Magistrate Millicent Sherman, who entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. Sherman ordered Pugh held on $500,000 bond and remanded him to the Wayne County Jail. On August 5, 2016, Wayne County District Court Judge Deborah Langston bound Pugh over for trial on five of the six felony counts, while dismissing one count of third degree CSC. She reduced Pugh's bond to $150,000 cash. On October 26, 2016, Pugh pleaded guilty in Wayne County Circuit Court before Judge Thomas Cameron. Pugh's plea agreement called for him to agree to plead guilty to two counts of third degree CSC, while prosecutors dropped three counts on first degree CSC. His deal calls for him to serve between 5 1/2 to 15 years in prison and register as a sex offender for life. In the hearing, Pugh admitted to having sex with the victim at least twice in 2003 and 2004, when the victim was between 13 and 15. Cameron formally sentenced Pugh to 5 1/2 to 15 years in prison on November 9, 2016.

Biography Johnson was born December 18, 1905, in Spring Creek, Pennsylvania, and had a younger brother, George. Johnson's youthful interest in cartooning had the support of his family after he won an Erie Dispatch Herald cartoon contest. He recalled in 1989, \\"I think I was 11 years old. And then I won a newspaper cartoon drawing contest, and I think the prize was two or three tickets to Peck's Bad Boy, and that got my dad to thinking, and he gave me a $28 correspondence course. I went through that and worked on the high school yearbook all the time. I did lots of drawings there. At 13, I sold my first cartoon for money to a railroad magazine. It paid me $10 a month for years and years.\\" After graduating from high school in 1923, he attended the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts for three months. When Moon Mullins creator Frank Willard taught briefly there, Willard invited the talented youngster to visit his workplace, The Chicago Tribune. Johnson recalled, \\"I stood around there for hours watching him work. He finally turned around and said, 'Ferd, if you're going to hang around here all this time, I'm going to put you to work.' So I got a job as assistant at 15 bucks a week. I wrote home, and I said, 'Don't send me any more money. I've got it made.\\"McLellan, p. 2 Dropping out of school, he became Willard assistant two months after Willard launched Moon Mullins in 1923. Johnson worked at the Tribune as a color artist and sports illustrator. While Johnson was still in his teens, the paper offered him the opportunity to create his own comic strip. Johnson's effort, Texas Slim, about a ranch hand working for the antihero Dirty Dalton, debuted as a Sunday page from the Tribune Syndicate on August 30, 1925. It ran three years, until February 12, 1928. Starting October 4, 1931, Johnson revived Texas Slim as a topper strip paired with his short-lived domestic-comedy strip Lovey Dovey. The topper lasted until September 11, 1932; Lovey Dovey held on until September 25, 1933. On April 7, 1940, the characters returned once again as a Sunday strip titled Texas Slim & Dirty Dalton, which ran through 1958. This strip had its own topper, Buzzy, which ran from 1943 to 1953. Willard and Johnson traveled to Florida, Maine and Los Angeles, doing Moon Mullins while living in hotels, apartments and farmhouses. At its peak of popularity during the 1940s and 1950s, the strip ran in 350 newspapers. According to Johnson, he had been doing the strip solo for at least a decade before Willard's death on January 11, 1958. \\"They put my name on it then\\", Johnson said in 1989. \\"I had been doing it about 10 years before that because Willard had heart attacks and strokes and all that stuff. The minute my name went on that thing and his name went off, 25 papers dropped the strip. That shows you that, although I had been doing it 10 years, the name means a lot.\\" After Willard's death, the Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate hired Johnson as Willard's logical successor, and he began signing the strip. Johnson recalled that, 'Texas [Slim & Dirty Dalton] ran until 1958 when I took over Moon completely. Up to then I was working on both Moon and Texas and some advertising work, and taking some time off to eat and sleep.\\"National Cartoonists Society He stayed with the strip until it concluded in June 1991. In 1978, his son, Tom Johnson, signed on as his assistant (drawing the Sunday page and assisting on the dailies). Ferd Johnson worked on Moon Mullins for 68 years, a stint that comics historian Don Markstein calls \\"probably the longest in the history of American comics.\\"Texas Slim at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on October 13, 2015. Johnson continued to draw and paint after he moved into a retirement home in Irvine, California in 1995, and he died 15 months later.

It was desanctified in 2013 and sold by the congregation on November 24, 2014. The current location is at 1206 New York State Route 52, Walden, New York, United States. Ground was broken on a new House of Worship in September 2019 and is scheduled for completion in the spring of 2020. The historic church is a brick building constructed in the late 19th century, for a congregation dating to 1817. Primarily in the late Victorian Gothic architectural style, its complex massing and decoration include elements of other contemporary modes such as Romanesque Revival. Its ornate interior, originally built in the Akron Plan, reflects changing thinking regarding church interior design from the era of its construction. It has survived mostly intact to the present. The current building incorporates part of an earlier church on the same site built in 1840 for another church. In the early 20th century a parsonage was built next door, and other facilities were built later in the century to the south. Due to increasing maintenance costs, the congregation voted to move to the new site and build another church there. In 2008 the historic church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building The church's lot is located at the southeast corner of West Main and Pine streets, on the western edge of downtown, on the opposite corner of the same large block from St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, also listed on the National Register. The ground slopes gently west towards the Wallkill River. The church's main bell tower rises well above tree level, making the church a prominent aspect of the village skyline when viewed from the west. There are three buildings on the property: the church (the only contributing resource to the listing), its parsonage to the east and a rental property to the west, all facing on West Main. A parking lot with its entrance on Pine Street is behind the buildings, along with a fenced-in playground. In front is a small lawn, sloping gently to the sidewalk, with a large mature tree and shrubbery on the side. Exterior The dark red painted brick exterior of the church is complemented by black asphalt roofing and rough-hewn bluestone courses. It has three sections: a fellowship hall on the east, central bell tower and worship section on the west. They create a north (front) facade that starts with the three-bay gabled roof. Tall Gothic arched windows, the center one larger than those on the flanks, with bluestone sills and keystones, are centered in the first story, with a pair of smaller double-hung sash windows in the apex, set off by a brickwork course. At the northeast corner is a tower. Six stone steps and a railing lead to its ground-floor entrance, with paired batten doors in a Gothic opening with a similar treatment as the fellowship hall windows. Above it is a stained glass transom and small lozenge-shaped window above. Decorative corbeling marks the roofline and the transition to a pyramidal roof with finial. The ground floot of the three-stage bell tower has a Gothic door similar to, but larger, than the northeast tower. On either side are corner buttresses. They rise to the bluestone course that sets off the second stage, and also serves as the sill for a group of three small sash windows. The third stage harbors the bell, with large arched louvered openings rising from another belt course, split by a third at the impost. Above the corbeled roofline, the octagonal spire rises, topped by a cross and set off with four small pyramids at the corners, to 100 feet (30 m) high. At the worship space, a three-sided steeply pitched gabled section projects from the pyramid-roofed main block. The wall spaces on the bay have large windows similar to those on the fellowship hall. Those on the side sections are subdivided into two smaller arched windows below the impost, and two small windows are located in the gable apex. At the extreme west is a third entry, a projecting gabled vestibule with similar doors leading to a white wooden wheelchair ramp. The east profile has five tall square-headed windows with bluestone trim. On the southeast is a gabled block used for the outreach office, aligned with the roof crest parallel to the wall. The west elevation has three gables, with the middle one larger. It has three arched windows similar to the other ones; the flanking gables have small lozenges in their apexes. In the center apex are two smaller trabeated windows. On this section is an engaged endwall chimney, consisting of two that rise separately and then join at the apex. It is parged in a tan-colored substance. At the southwest is a small two-by-two-bay flat- roofed brick classroom addition with segmental arch window openings now filled with modern aluinum sash windows. On the rear facade are the two rear bays of the classroom addition, a bricked-in window on another gabled projection and seven segmented-arch windows (one also bricked in) in the choir alcove. There is also a shed-roofed projection between the south wall and west addition, and two more second story trabeated windows. Interior The tower entrance leads into a vestibule that leads directly into the worship area. Oak slip pews, with scroll armrests and hymnal racks on the rear, are arranged in semicircular fashion around a dais and organ opposite. Doors on the south lead to two classrooms. The plaster on sawn lath walls have beaded wainscoting, stained lighter than the chair rail at its top. They rise to vaulted ceilings finished in deep-stained thin-width board with molded wood ribs and paterae at vault intersections. Flat surfaces between the roof and ceiling are marked by a plaster cornice. Circular fluted columns with similarly shaped capitals support the roof timber. On the east, a similar vestibule, connected to the main one by a hallway and stairs, leads into the fellowship room. It is similarly decorated, but more modestly, with acoustic tiles covering its ceiling. The windows have flat molding indicating that they survive from the 1840s predecessor to the current building. Four are memorial stained glass; two are figural while the other two are architectural. The remaining rooms are furnished more modestly, in modern styles. The basement areas have flagstone floors and painted cinderblock walls. Aesthetics The church's original layout followed Lewis Miller's Akron Plan, in which the Sunday school and worship areas were adjacent, with sliding partitions allowing for controlled access between the two. It could also be used to expand the worship space for overflow crowds. This arrangement had apparently been abandoned by the early 1920s in favor of fixed walls and room sizes. Another feature of the church that reflects the era of its construction is the auditorium-style worship space, in which the pews are arranged in a semicircle aruund the dais. It was a popular way to maximize available worship space, allowing for clearer sightlines from all seats. The only aspect of the plan the Walden Methodist Church lacks is the inclined floor. The building's exterior is eclectic, another late 19th century touch, reflecting the move away from the early Gothic Revival's insistence on historically correct detail. Victorian Gothic, seen in the high lancet windows accentuated by the steep roofs and towers. The stone belt courses amid the red brick facade and understated polychromy are also more distinctly High Victorian Gothic, showing the influence of John Ruskin's aesthetic theories and the Venetian Gothic. On the other hand, the corbelling at the towers suggests a Romanesque Revival nod, and the upper gable of the fellowship hall suggests Richardsonian Romanesque. Inside, the rich decoration was meant to enhance the character of the worship service. The stained glass floods the hall with mellow-toned natural light, augmented by electric light fixtures hung from the ceiling. The most important aspect of the interior is the intricate vaulted ceiling. All reflected an era when Protestant church interiors were moving away from the asceticism that had characterized them earlier in the century, with the intent of providing an atmosphere more conducive to the proper spirit of worship. History 1817‚Äì93 The first Methodist meetings in Walden, then known as Walden's Mills, were held around 1817. At first congregants used the services of an itinerant preacher, and met in the ballroom of a local tavern. Later they used a schoolhouse on what is today Ulster Avenue (NY 208). By 1850 the congregation decided that it needed a church of its own, and a committee was formed to bring that about. It bought for $1,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) the former Scotch Covenanter Society church built at the present site in 1840. It was expanded in 1870 to keep pace with the church's steady growth during the late 19th century. As the century continued and the village grew and prospered, so did the church. In the late 1880s members began discussing building a new one, as there were over 350 of them with almost as many in Sunday school each week. Under a new pastor, The Rev. J.M. Cornish, those plans began to take more definite form. A subscription drive brought the church $11,000 ($ in contemporary dollars). It is not known who the architect was. The general contractor, Edwin McWilliams of Middletown broke ground in spring 1893. A cornerstone-laying ceremony in August of that year featured the district's presiding elder and a 40-year member of the congregation, from the days when Walden United Methodist had just moved into the building being replaced. The old church was moved to the east and enclosed in brick to serve as the new church's Sunday school. 1893‚Äìpresent The first significant change to the building came in 1906 when four stained glass windows were added to the east facade of the fellowship hall. In 1911 the parsonage was built on the church's west. It is two-and-a-half-story gabled Queen Anne Style home that has since been resided in vinyl and thus is not considered contributing to the National Register listing. At some point prior to the 1920s the partitions and fluid space of the Akron Plan interior were abandoned in favor of fixed walls. This would be compensated for by the 1933 addition of the classroom wing onto the southwest corner. In 1952 came another addition, a small office block on the southeast. Later on in the 20th century, in the early 1960s, an engineering and construction campaign led to the excavation of a new basement and additional facilities below ground level. In the 1990s and 2000s, the wheelchair ramps were added. Maintenance costs for the building were still considerable enough that in 2007, members of the congregation voted narrowly to explore moving to a new site and constructing a new church. They noted that the building needed $2 million of repairs, and that a third of the church's budget went to annual operating and maintenance costs, meaning that only six cents of every donated dollar could be used for church activities. Some dissenting members felt that their fellow congregants were acting too hastily, that the building could be saved. They also noted that only 95 of 344 eligible members voted, and felt those who were absent should have been allowed to vote as well. The church today Walden United Methodist has a very active religious program and presence in the community.

This may be the result of a popular association during this period between his ideas and those of Max Stirner.\\"Nietzsche's possible reading, knowledge, and plagiarism of Max Stirner's The Ego and Its Own (1845) has been a contentious question and frequently discussed for more than a century now.\\" Thomas H. Brobjer, \\"Philologica: A Possible Solution to the Stirner-Nietzsche Question\\", in The Journal of Nietzsche Studies - Issue 25, Spring 2003, pp. 109‚Äì114Bernd A.

Spencer Sunshine writes that \\"[t]here were many things that drew anarchists to Nietzsche: his hatred of the state; his disgust for the mindless social behavior of 'herds'; his anti- Christianity; his distrust of the effect of both the market and the State on cultural production; his desire for an 'overman'‚Äîthat is, for a new human who was to be neither master nor slave; his praise of the ecstatic and creative self, with the artist as his prototype, who could say, 'Yes' to the self- creation of a new world on the basis of nothing; and his forwarding of the 'transvaluation of values' as source of change, as opposed to a Marxist conception of class struggle and the dialectic of a linear history\\". For Sunshine, \\"[t]he list is not limited to culturally-oriented anarchists such as Emma Goldman, who gave dozens of lectures about Nietzsche and baptized him as an honorary anarchist. Pro-Nietzschean anarchists also include prominent Spanish CNT‚ÄìFAI members in the 1930s such as Salvador Segu√≠ and anarcha- feminist Federica Montseny; anarcho-syndicalist militants like Rudolf Rocker; and even the younger Murray Bookchin, who cited Nietzsche's conception of the 'transvaluation of values' in support of the Spanish anarchist project.\\" Also, in European individualist anarchist circles, his influence is clear in thinker/activists such as Emile Armand and Renzo Novatore among others. Also more recently in post-left anarchy Nietzsche is present in the thought of Albert Camus, Hakim Bey, Michel Onfray, and Wolfi Landstreicher.  Max Stirner and Nietzsche  Max Stirner was a Hegelian philosopher whose \\"name appears with familiar regularity in historically-orientated surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of individualist anarchism\\". In 1844, his The Ego and Its Own (Der Einzige and sein Eigentum which may literally be translated as The Unique Individual and His PropertyMoggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press. p. 177) was published, which is considered to be \\"a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism\\". Caricature of Max Stirner taken from a sketch by Friedrich Engels during one of the Die Freien meetings.The ideas of 19th-century German philosophers Max Stirner and Friedrich Nietzsche have often been compared, and many authors have discussed apparent similarities in their writings, sometimes raising the question of influence. In Germany, during the early years of Nietzsche's emergence as a well-known figure, the only thinker discussed in connection with his ideas more often than Stirner was Schopenhauer.While discussion of possible influence has never ceased entirely, the period of most intense discussion occurred between c. 1892 and 1906 in the German-speaking world. During this time, the most comprehensive account of Nietzsche's reception in the German language, the 4 volume work of Richard Frank Krummel: Nietzsche und der deutsche Geist, indicates 83 entries discussing Stirner and Nietzsche. The only thinker more frequently discussed in connection with Nietzsche during this time is Schopenhauer, with about twice the number of entries. Discussion steadily declines thereafter, but is still significant. Nietzsche and Stirner show 58 entries between 1901 and 1918. From 1919 to 1945 there are 28 entries regarding Nietzsche and Stirner. It is certain that Nietzsche read about Stirner's book The Ego and Its Own (Der Einzige und sein Eigentum, 1845), which was mentioned in Lange's History of Materialism (1866) and Eduard von Hartmann's Philosophy of the Unconscious (1869), both of which young Nietzsche knew very well.Nietzsche discovered Lange's book immediately after its appearance and praised it as \\"the most important philosophical work in decades\\" (letter to Hermann Mushacke, mid November 1866); as to Hartmann, who was also developing the ideas of Schopenhauer, Nietzsche singled out his book in his second Untimely Meditation for a caustic criticism, and concentrated on precisely the chapter dealing with Stirner, though he did not once mention Stirner's name; Hartmann wrote: \\"\\"Nietzsche does not mention at any place the name of Stirner or his writings. That he must have known my emphatic hint to Stirner's standpoint and its importance in the 'Philosophy of the Unconscious' arises from his polemic criticism of exactly that chapter which it contains. That he did not see himself prompted by this hint to get acquainted more closely with this thinker so congenial with himself is of little plausibility.\\" Eduard von Hartmann, Ethische Studien, Leipzig: Haacke 1898, pp. 34‚Äì69 However, there is no irrefutable indication that he actually read it, as no mention of Stirner is known to exist anywhere in Nietzsche's publications, papers or correspondence.Albert Levy, Stirner and Nietzsche, Paris, 1904, p. 9 And yet as soon as Nietzsche's work began to reach a wider audience the question of whether or not he owed a debt of influence to Stirner was raised. As early as 1891 (while Nietzsche was still alive, though incapacitated by mental illness) Eduard von Hartmann went so far as to suggest that he had plagiarized Stirner.Eduard von Hartmann, Nietzsches \\"neue Moral\\", in Preussische Jahrb√ºcher, 67. Jg., Heft 5, Mai 1891, S. 501‚Äì521; augmented version with more express reproach of plagiarism in: Ethische Studien, Leipzig, Haacke 1898, pp. 34‚Äì69 By the turn of the century the belief that Nietzsche had been influenced by Stirner was so widespread that it became something of a commonplace, at least in Germany, prompting one observer to note in 1907 \\"Stirner's influence in modern Germany has assumed astonishing proportions, and moves in general parallel with that of Nietzsche. The two thinkers are regarded as exponents of essentially the same philosophy.\\"This author believes that one should be careful in comparing the two men. However, he notes: \\"It is this intensive nuance of individualism that appeared to point from Nietzsche to Max Stirner, the author of the remarkable work Der Einzige und sein Eigentum. Stirner's influence in modern Germany has assumed astonishing proportions, and moves in general parallel with that of Nietzsche. The two thinkers are regarded as exponents of essentially the same philosophy.\\" Oscar Ewald, \\"German Philosophy in 1907\\", in The Philosophical Review, Vol. 17, No. 4, Jul., 1908, pp. 400‚Äì426 Nevertheless, from the very beginning of what was characterized as \\"great debate\\"[in the last years of the 19th century] \\"The question of whether Nietzsche had read Stirner was the subject of great debate\\" R.A. Nicholls, \\"Beginnings of the Nietzsche Vogue in Germany\\", in Modern Philology, Vol. 56, No. 1, Aug., 1958, pp. 29‚Äì30 regarding Stirner's possible influence on Nietzsche‚Äîpositive or negative‚Äîserious problems with the idea were noted.Levy pointed out in 1904 that the similarities in the writing of the two men appeared superficial. Albert Levy, Stirner and Nietzsche, Paris, 1904 By the middle of the 20th century, if Stirner was mentioned at all in works on Nietzsche, the idea of influence was often dismissed outright or abandoned as unanswerable.R.A. Nicholls, \\"Beginnings of the Nietzsche Vogue in Germany\\", in Modern Philology, Vol. 56, No. 1, Aug., 1958, pp. 24‚Äì37 But the idea that Nietzsche was influenced in some way by Stirner continues to attract a significant minority, perhaps because it seems necessary to explain in some reasonable fashion the often-noted (though arguably superficial) similarities in their writings.\\"Stirner, like Nietzsche, who was clearly influenced by him, has been interpreted in many different ways\\", Saul Newman, From Bakunin to Lacan: Anti-authoritarianism and the Dislocation of Power, Lexington Books, 2001, p. 56; \\"We do not even know for sure that Nietzsche had read Stirner. Yet, the similarities are too striking to be explained away.\\" R. A. Samek, The Meta Phenomenon, p70, New York, 1981; Tom Goyens, (referring to Stirner's book The Ego and His Own) \\"The book influenced Friedrich Nietzsche, and even Marx and Engels devoted some attention to it.\\" T. Goyens, Beer and Revolution: The German Anarchist Movement in New York City, p197, Illinois, 2007 In any case, the most significant problems with the theory of possible Stirner influence on Nietzsche are not limited to the difficulty in establishing whether the one man knew of or read the other. They also consist in establishing precisely how and why Stirner in particular might have been a meaningful influence on a man as widely read as Nietzsche.\\"We have every reason to suppose that Nietzsche had a profound knowledge of the Hegelian movement, from Hegel to Stirner himself. The philosophical learning of an author is not assessed by the number of quotations, nor by the always fanciful and conjectural check lists of libraries, but by the apologetic or polemical directions of his work itself.\\" Gilles Deleuze (translated by Hugh Tomlinson), Nietzsche and Philosophy, 1962 (2006 reprint, pp. 153‚Äì154)  Individualist anarchism   Individualist anarchism in the United States The two men were frequently compared by French \\"literary anarchists\\" and anarchist interpretations of Nietzschean ideas appear to have also been influential in the United States.O. Ewald, \\"German Philosophy in 1907\\", in The Philosophical Review, Vol. 17, No. 4, Jul., 1908, pp. 400‚Äì426; T. A.

Holub's Nietzsche: Socialist, Anarchist, Feminist, an essay available online at the University of California, Berkeley website. One researcher notes: \\"Indeed, translations of Nietzsche's writings in the United States very likely appeared first in Liberty, the anarchist journal edited by Benjamin Tucker.\\" He adds \\"Tucker preferred the strategy of exploiting his writings, but proceeding with due caution: 'Nietzsche says splendid things, ‚Äì often, indeed, Anarchist things, ‚Äì but he is no Anarchist. It is of the Anarchists, then, to intellectually exploit this would-be exploiter. He may be utilized profitably, but not prophetably.'\\"Robert C. Holub, Nietzsche: Socialist, Anarchist, Feminist  Individualist anarchism in Europe  In European individualist anarchist circles his influence might have been stronger. As such French individualist anarchist and free love propagandist Emile Armand writes in mixed Stirnerian and Nietzschetian language\\"The life of Emile Armand (1872-1963) spanned the history of anarchism. He was influenced by Leo Tolstoy and Benjamin Tucker, and to a lesser extent by Whitman and Emerson. Later in life, Nietzsche and Stirner became important to his way of thinking.\\"Introduction to The Anarchism of √âmile Armand by Emile Armand when he describes the anarchists as those who \\"are pioneers attached to no party, non-conformists, standing outside herd morality and conventional 'good' and 'evil', 'a-social'. A 'species' apart, one might say. They go forward, stumbling, sometimes falling, sometimes triumphant, sometimes vanquished. But they do go forward, and by living for themselves, these 'egoists', they dig the furrow, they open the broach through which will pass those who deny archism, the unique ones who will succeed them.\\"The Anarchism of √âmile Armand by Emile Armand Italian individualist anarchist and illegalist Renzo Novatore also shows a strong influence by Nietzsche. \\"Written around 1921, Toward the Creative Nothing, which visibly feels the effects of Nietzsche's influence on the author, attacks Christianity, socialism, democracy, fascism one after the other, showing the material and spiritual destitution in them.\\"Toward the Creative Nothing by Renzo Novatore In this poetic essay he writes: \\"For you, great things are in good as in evil. But we live beyond good and evil, because all that is great belongs to beauty\\" and \\"[e]ven the spirit of Zarathustra‚Äîthe truest lover of war and the most sincere friend of warriors‚Äîmust have remained sufficiently disgusted and scornful since somebody heard him exclaim: 'For me, you must be those who stretch your eyes in search of the enemy of your enemy. And in some of you hatred blazes at first glance. You must look for your enemy, fight your war. And this for your ideas! And if your idea succumbs, your rectitude cries of triumph!' But alas! The heroic sermon of the liberating barbarian availed nothing.\\"  Individualist anarchism in Latin America  Argentinian anarchist historian Angel Cappelletti reports that in Argentina: \\"Among the workers that came from Europe in the 2 first decades of the century, there was curiously some Stirnerian individualists influenced by the philosophy of Nietzsche, that saw syndicalism as a potential enemy of anarchist ideology. They established [...] affinity groups that in 1912 came to, according to Max Nettlau, to the number of 20. In 1911 there appeared, in Col√≥n, the periodical El √önico, that defined itself as 'Publicaci√≥n individualista'\\".El Anarquismo en Am√©rica Latina por Carlos M. Rama y √Ångel J. Cappelletti. pg. CLVII Vicente Rojas Lizcano whose pseudonym was Bi√≥filo Panclasta, was a Colombian individualist anarchist writer and activist. In 1904 he begins using the name Biofilo Panclasta. \\"Biofilo\\" in Spanish stands for \\"lover of life\\" and \\"panclasta\\" for \\"enemy of all\\".PANCLASTA, Bi√≥filo (1928): Comprimidos psicol√≥gicos de los revolucionarios criollos. Peri√≥dico Claridad, Bogot√°, N¬∫ 52, 53, 54, 55 y 56. He visited more than fifty countries propagandizing for anarchism which in his case was highly influenced by the thought of Max Stirner and Friedrich Nietzsche. Among his written works there are Siete a√±os enterrado vivo en una de las mazmorras de Gomezuela: Horripilante relato de un resucitado(1932) and Mis prisiones, mis destierros y mi vida (1929) which talk about his many adventures while living his life as an adventurer, activist and vagabond, as well as his thought and the many times he was imprisoned in different countries. Anarcho-syndicalists and anarcho-communists The American anarchist publication Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed reports that German \\"[a]narchist Gustav Landauer‚Äôs major work, For Socialism, is also squarely based on Nietzschean ideas.\\" Rudolf Rocker was yet another anarchist admirer of Nietzsche. A proponent of anarcho-syndicalism, \\"Rocker invokes Nietzsche repeatedly in his tome Nationalism and Culture, citing him especially to back up his claims that nationalism and state power have a destructive influence on culture, since 'Culture is always creative', but 'power is never creative.' Rocker even ends his book with a Nietzsche quote.\\" Rocker begins Nationalism and Culture using the theory of will to power to refute Marxism, stating that \\"[t]he deeper we trace the political influences in history, the more are we convinced that the 'will to power' has up to now been one of the strongest motives in the development of human social forms. The idea that all political and social events are but the result of given economic conditions and can be explained by them cannot endure careful consideration.\\"http://flag.blackened.net/rocker/works.htm#Nationalism%20and%20Culture Nationalism and Culture by Rudolf Rocker Rocker also translated Thus Spoke Zarathustra into Yiddish. Sunshine says that the \\"Spanish anarchists also mixed their class politics with Nietzschean inspiration\\". Murray Bookchin, in The Spanish Anarchists, describes prominent CNT‚ÄìFAI member Salvador Segu√≠ as \\"an admirer of Nietzschean individualism, of the superhombre to whom 'all is permitted'\\". Bookchin, in his 1973 introduction to Sam Dolgoff's The Anarchist Collectives, even describes the reconstruction of society by the workers as a Nietzschean project. Bookchin says that \\"workers must see themselves as human beings, not as class beings; as creative personalities, not as 'proletarians,' as self-affirming individuals, not as 'masses' [...] [the] economic component must be humanized precisely by bringing an 'affinity of friendship' to the work process, by diminishing the role of onerous work in the lives of producers, indeed by a total 'transvaluation of values' (to use Nietzsche's phrase) as it applies to production and consumption as well as social and personal life\\". \\"Alan Antliff documents [in I Am Not A Man, I Am Dynamite] how the Indian art critic and anti-imperialist Ananda Coomaraswamy combined Nietzsche's individualism and sense of spiritual renewal with both Kropotkin's economics and with Asian idealist religious thought. This combination was offered as a basis for the opposition to British colonization as well as to industrialization.\\"  Anarcha-feminists  Although Nietzsche has been accused of misogyny, nevertheless he gained the admiration of two important anarcha-feminists writer/activists. This is the case of Emma GoldmanLiving My Life by Emma Goldman and Federica Montseny.  Emma Goldman  Emma Goldman was profoundly influenced by Nietzsche \\"so much so that all of Nietzsche's books could be mail-ordered through her magazine Mother Earth\\". Ultimately Goldman's view of Nietzsche can be summarized when she manifests in her autobiography Living My Life, \\"I pointed out that Nietzsche was not a social theorist but a poet, a rebel and innovator. His aristocracy was neither of birth nor of purse; it was of the spirit. In that respect Nietzsche was an anarchist, and all true anarchists were aristocrats, I said\\" and \\"[i]n Vienna one could hear interesting lectures on modern German prose and poetry. One could read the works of the young iconoclasts in art and letters, the most daring among them being Nietzsche. The magic of his language, the beauty of his vision, carried me to undreamed-of heights. I longed to devour every line of his writings, but I was too poor to buy them.\\"http://www.revoltlib.com/?id=477 Living My Life by Emma Goldman Goldman even went as far as to \\"baptize\\" Nietzsche \\"as an honorary anarchist\\". Emma Goldman \\"always combined his championing of the self-creating individual with a kind of Kropotkinist anarcho-communism\\". Emma Goldman, in the introductory essay called \\"Anarchism: What It Really Stands For\\" from Anarchism and Other Essays, passionately defends both Nietzsche and Max Stirner from attacks within anarchism, stating that \\"[t]he most disheartening tendency common among readers is to tear out one sentence from a work, as a criterion of the writer's ideas or personality. Friedrich Nietzsche, for instance, is decried as a hater of the weak because he believed in the Uebermensch. It does not occur to the shallow interpreters of that giant mind that this vision of the Uebermensch also called for a state of society which will not give birth to a race of weaklings and slaves.\\"Anarchism and Other Essays by Emma Goldman Emma Goldman, circa 1911Another similar application of Nietzsche to feminist criticism happens in \\"Victims of Morality\\" where she states: \\"Morality has no terrors for her who has risen beyond good and evil. And though Morality may continue to devour its victims, it is utterly powerless in the face of the modern spirit, that shines in all its glory upon the brow of man and woman, liberated and unafraid.\\" Later in a feminist reading of Nietzsche she writes the following: \\"Nietzsche's memorable maxim, 'When you go to woman, take the whip along,' is considered very brutal, yet Nietzsche expressed in one sentence the attitude of woman towards her gods [...].Religion, especially the Christian religion, has condemned woman to the life of an inferior, a slave. It has thwarted her nature and fettered her soul, yet the Christian religion has no greater supporter, none more devout, than woman. Indeed, it is safe to say that religion would have long ceased to be a factor in the lives of the people, if it were not for the support it receives from woman. The most ardent churchworkers, the most tireless missionaries the world over, are women, always sacrificing on the altar of the gods that have chained her spirit and enslaved her body.\\" In the controversial essay \\"Minorities Versus Majorities\\", clear Nietzschetian themes emerge when she manifests that \\"[i]f I were to give a summary of the tendency of our times, I would say, Quantity. The multitude, the mass spirit, dominates everywhere, destroying quality.\\" \\"Today, as then, public opinion is the omnipresent tyrant; today, as then, the majority represents a mass of cowards, willing to accept him who mirrors its own soul and mind poverty.\\" \\"That the mass bleeds, that it is being robbed and exploited, I know as well as our vote-baiters. But I insist that not the handful of parasites, but the mass itself is responsible for this horrible state of affairs. It clings to its masters, loves the whip, and is the first to cry Crucify!\\"  Federica Montseny  Federica Montseny was an editor of the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine La Revista Blanca, who later achieved infamy when as an important member of the CNT-FAI was one of the four anarchists who accepted cabinet positions in the Spanish Popular Front government. \\"Nietzsche and Stirner‚Äîas well as the playwright Ibsen and anarchist-geographer Elisee Reclus‚Äîwere her favorite writers, according to Richard Kern (in Red Years / Black Years: A Political History of Spanish Anarchism, 1911‚Äì1937). Kern says she held that the \\"emancipation of women would lead to a quicker realization of the social revolution\\" and that \\"the revolution against sexism would have to come from intellectual and militant 'future-women.' According to this Nietzschean concept of Federica Monteseny's, women could realize through art and literature the need to revise their own roles.\\"  Existentialist anarchism  Albert CamusAlbert Camus is often cited as a proponent of existentialism (the philosophy that he was associated with during his own lifetime), but Camus himself refused this particular label. Camus is also known as an ardent critic of Marxism and regimes based on it, and aligned himself with anarchism while also being a critic of modern capitalist society and fascism.\\"Camus also supported the Groupes de Liaison Internationale which sought to give aid to opponents of fascism and Stalinism, and which refused to take the side of American capitalism.\\"\\"Albert Camus and the Anarchists\\" by ORGANISE! Camus' The Rebel (1951) presents an anarchist view on politics, influenced as much by Nietzsche as by Max Stirner. \\"Like Nietzsche, he maintains a special admiration for Greek and Persian heroic values and pessimism for classical virtues like courage and honor. What might be termed Romantic values also merit particular esteem within his philosophy: passion, absorption in being, sensory experience, the glory of the moment, the beauty of the world.\\"\\"Albert Camus (1913‚Äî1960)\\" Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy \\"The general secretary of the F√©d√©ration Anarchiste, Georges Fontenis, also reviewed Camus's book [The Rebel] in Le Libertaire. To the title question 'Is the revolt of Camus the same as ours?', Fontenis replied that it was.\\" In the United Kingdom Herbert Read, who was highly influenced by Max Stirner and later came close to existentialism (see existentialist anarchism), said of Nietzsche: \\"It was Nietzsche who first made us conscious of the significance of the individual as a term in the evolutionary process‚Äîin that part of the evolutionary process which has still to take place.\\"http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bright/read/philsofanar.html Post-left anarchy and insurrectionary anarchism Post-left anarchist Hakim Bey while explaining his main concept of immediatism says that \\"[t]he penetration of everyday life by the marvelous--the creation of 'situations'‚Äîbelongs to the 'material bodily principle', and to the imagination, and to the living fabric of the present [...]. The individual who realizes this immediacy can widen the circle of pleasure to some extent simply by waking from the hypnosis of the 'Spooks' (as Stirner called all abstractions); and yet more can be accomplished by 'crime'; and still more by the doubling of the Self in sexuality. From Stirner's 'Union of Self-Owning Ones' we proceed to Nietzsche's circle of 'Free Spirits' and thence to Charles Fourier's 'Passional Series', doubling and redoubling ourselves even as the Other multiplies itself in the eros of the group.\\"Immediatism by Hakim Bey A Nietzschean criticism of identity politics was provided by insurrectionary anarchist Feral Faun in \\"The ideology of victimization\\" when he affirms there's a \\"feminist version of the ideology of victimization‚Äîan ideology which promotes fear, individual weakness (and subsequently dependence on ideologically based support groups and paternalistic protection from the authorities)\\",\\"The ideology of victimization\\" by Feral Faun but in the end, \\"[l]ike all ideologies, the varieties of the ideology of victimization are forms of fake consciousness. Accepting the social role of victim‚Äîin whatever one of its many forms‚Äîis choosing to not even create one's life for oneself or to explore one's real relationships to the social structures. All of the partial liberation movements‚Äîfeminism, gay liberation, racial liberation, workers' movements and so on‚Äîdefine individuals in terms of their social roles. Because of this, these movements not only do not include a reversal of perspectives which breaks down social roles and allows individuals to create a praxis built on their own passions and desires; they actually work against such a reversal of perspective. The 'liberation' of a social role to which the individual remains subject.\\"  Post-anarchism  Michel OnfrayPost-anarchism is a contemporary hybrid of anarchism and post-structuralism. Post- structuralism in itself is profoundly influenced by Nietzsche in its main thinkers such as Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze as well as the early influence of Georges Bataille on these authors. Nevertheless, within post- anarchism the British Saul Newman wrote an article called \\"Anarchism and the politics of ressentiment\\"\\"Anarchism and the politics of ressentiment\\" by Saul Newman in which he notes how Nietzsche \\"sees anarchism as poisoned at the root by the pestiferous weed of ressentiment‚Äîthe spiteful politics of the weak and pitiful, the morality of the slave\\" and so his essay decides to \\"take seriously his charge against anarchism\\". And so he proposes how \\"anarchism could become a new 'heroic' philosophy, which is no longer reactive but, rather, creates values\\" and proposes a notion of community that \\"of active power‚Äîa community of 'masters' rather than 'slaves'. It would be a community that sought to overcome itself‚Äîcontinually transforming itself and revelling in the knowledge of its power to do so.\\" On the other hand, the proponent of postmodern anarchism Lewis Call wrote an essay called \\"Toward an Anarchy of Becoming: Nietzsche\\"Lewis Call. Postmodern Anarchism. Lexington: Lexington Books. 2002. in which he argues that \\"despite Nietzsche's hostility towards anarchism, his writing contains all the elements of a nineteenth century anarchist politics [...] Nietzsche unleashes another kind of anarchy, an anarchy of becoming. By teaching us that we must pursue a perpetual project of self-overcoming and self-creation, constantly losing and finding ourselves in the river of becoming, Nietzsche ensures that our subjectivity will be fluid and dispersed, multiple and pluralistic rather than fixed and centered, singular and totalitarian. These twin anarchies, the critical anarchy of the subject and the affirmative anarchy of becoming, form the basis for a postmodern Nietzschetian anarchism\\".Lewis Call. Postmodern Anarchism. Lexington: Lexington Books. 2002. Pg. 33 Recently, the French anarchist and hedonist philosopher Michel Onfray has embraced the term postanarchism to describe his approach to politics and ethics.Michel Onfray : le post anarchisme expliqu√© √† ma grand-m√®re He has said that the May 68 revolts were \\"a Nietzschetian revolt in order to put an end to the 'One' truth, revealed, and to put in evidence the diversity of truths, in order to make disappear ascetic Christian ideas and to help arise new possibilities of existence\\".\\"qu'il consid√®re comme une r√©volte nietzsch√©enne pour avoir mis fin √† la V√©rit√© \\"Une\\", r√©v√©l√©e, en mettant en √©vidence la diversit√© de v√©rit√©s, pour avoir fait dispara√Ætre les id√©aux asc√©tiques chr√©tiens et fait surgir de nouvelles possibilit√©s d'existence.\\"Michel Onfray : le post anarchisme expliqu√© √† ma grand-m√®re In 2005 he published the essay De la sagesse tragique ‚Äì Essai sur Nietzschehttps://www.amazon.fr/sagesse-tragique-Essai- sur-Nietzsche/dp/2253082813 De la sagesse tragique - Essai sur Nietzsche (Poche) de Michel Onfray (Auteur) which could be translated as On tragic wisdom ‚Äì Essay on Nietzsche.

(Some Australian state herbaria continue to use the names Callistemon linearis, Callistemon pinifolius and Callistemon rigidus.) It is a medium-sized shrub with narrow leaves with a rigid point, and red flower spikes in late spring or early summer. Description Melaleuca linearis is a shrub growing to tall with grey, hard, fibrous bark. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are long, wide, narrow linear in shape and flat to channelled or semi-circular in cross section. There is a mid-vein but the lateral veins are inconspicuous. The flowers are a shade of red, rarely green and arranged in spikes on the ends of branches that continue to grow after flowering and also on the sides of the branches. The spikes are in diameter and long with 20 to 90 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower ages and there are 23‚Äì73 stamens in each flower. Flowering occurs from late spring to early summer and is followed by fruits that are woody capsules, long. Mature and immature capsules Growth habit Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca linearis was first formally described in 1796 by Heinrich Schrader and Johann Christoph Wendland in Sertum Hannoveranum. The specific epithet (linearis) is a Latin word linearis meaning \\"linear\\" in reference to the shape of the leaves of this species. There are two varieties: Melaleuca linearis var. linearis has leaves that are more than wide, usually 23‚Äì33 stamens per flower and occurs in Queensland south to the Coonabarabran and Narrabri districts in New South Wales and also in and between the Central Coast and Nowra districts in New South Wales. Melaleuca linearis var. pinifolia has leaves that are less than wide, 34‚Äì73 stamens per flower and occurs in the Gilgandra, Kandos and Sydney districts in New South Wales. Callistemon linearis is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca linearis, Callistemon pinifolius as a synonym of Melaleuca linearis var. acerosa (although this variety, named by Tausch has not been formally described) and Callistemon rigidus as a synonym of Melaleuca linearis var. linearis by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The National Herbarium of New South Wales retains the names Callistemon linearis (narrow-leaved bottlebrush), Callistemon pinifolius (pine-leaved bottlebrush) and Callistemon rigidus (stiff bottlebrush). Distribution and habitat Melaleuca linearis occurs in and between the south-east corner of Queensland, Nowra on the south coast of New South Wales and inland as far as Gilgandra. It grows in damp situations in a range of vegetation associations. Use in horticulture Melaleuca linearis has long been in cultivation (as Callistemon linearis, C. pinifolius and C. rigidus). Although not common in gardens, it is a hardy plant, thriving in most soils but preferring full sun. It is more resistant to pests such as sawfly than other melaleucas. It has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

This film is also known for featuring actors with uncanny resemblances to famous stars which include Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Andy Lau, Jay Chou, Nicholas Tse and Richie Ren. Plot It is the Ming Dynasty and bonfires burn in a moonlit wasteland. Yehe Changgong duels with Manchu warrior Nalan but purposely loses and relinquishes his title of Supreme Master of Martial Arts. He retires to the sleepy Sideroad Town, nestled in the shadow of the Imperial City, where he intends to see out the rest of his days peacefully, playing his erhu. Mingyue Xin catches his eye and they begin a musical duel, half seduction, and half stand-off. They agree to meet on the roof of the Royal Palace at the next full moon to finish their sonata. However, their night time rendezvous coincides with a break-in at the Palace by three masked thieves hoping to steal a rumoured treasure map. However, they are beaten to the punch by Xin, a ninja in disguise, who they pursue across the rooftops before cornering her at Lanruo Temple. Changgong pursues them and saves Xin from the clutches of the thieves. In the scuffle, the map is lost and with all five participants injured, they have no choice but to limp off their separate ways until they can track it down. Cut to five years later and the treasure-seeking warriors have come no closer to finding their prize, but have each assumed the disguise of a normal villager. Changgong and Xin run a restaurant - the Dragon Inn - with their adopted daughter Xiaowei, while the three thieves pass themselves off as a shopkeeper, singer and monk. They're all under the thumb of the young landowner, Lord Xu, a spoilt rich kid with a soft spot for Xiaowei. He struggles to gain the respect of the villagers and to collect their rent, until he lets obliviously slip that he is the custodian of the treasure map. Later mayor Gu Yuejin accidentally sends a pigeon about the treasure in the Imperial City. Loads of army come including the second army, led by Nalan. Xin, Xiaowei and Xu follow the treasure to claim the treasure while Changgong and Nalan engage in another duel. All five of them later encountered the treasure which turns out to be a spade. Nalan throws the spade away but later falls on him, killing him. The film ends with a party of all the citizens of the Sideroad Town.

Lattice scattering is the scattering of ions by interaction with atoms in a lattice. This effect can be qualitatively understood as phonons colliding with charge carriers. In the current quantum mechanical picture of conductivity the ease with which electrons traverse a crystal lattice is dependent on the near perfectly regular spacing of ions in that lattice. Only when a lattice contains perfectly regular spacing can the ion-lattice interaction (scattering) lead to almost transparent behavior of the lattice.

Situated along the Banas and Berach Rivers, as well as the Ahar River, the Ahar‚ÄìBanas people were exploiting the copper ores of the Aravalli Range to make axes and other artefacts. They were sustained on a number of crops, including wheat and barley. Geographical extent More than 90 sites of the Ahar culture have been identified to date. The main distribution seems to be concentrated in the river valleys of Banas and its tributaries. A number of sites with Ahar culture level are also found from Jawad, Mandsaur, Kayatha and Dangwada in Madhya Pradesh state. In Rajasthan, most of the sites are located in Udaipur, Chittorgarh, Dungarpur, Banswara, Ajmer, Tonk and Bhilwara districts, which include, Ahar, Gilund, Bansen, Keli, Balathal, Alod, Palod, Khor, Amoda, Nangauli, Champakheri, Tarawat, Fachar, Phinodra, Joera, Darauli, Gadriwas, Purani Marmi, Aguncha and Ojiyana. In 2003 excavations at Gilund, archaeologists discovered a large cache of seal impressions dating to 2100‚Äì1700 BC. A large bin filled with more than 100 seal impressions was found by a team led by archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania Museum and the Deccan College (Pune). The design motifs of the seals are generally quite simple, with wide-ranging parallels from various Indus Civilization sites. But also, there are parallels with seals from the Bactria‚ÄìMargiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) in Central Asia and northern Afghanistan, 1,000 miles to the northwest.Cache of Seal Impressions Discovered in Western India Offers Surprising New Evidence for Cultural Complexity in Little-known Ahar‚ÄìBanas Culture, Circa 3000‚Äì1500 B.C. University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology Ceramic assemblage Typical Ahar pottery is a Black-and-Red ware (BRW) with linear and dotted designs painted on it in white pigment and has a limited range of shapes, which include bowls, bowls-on-stands, elongated vases and globular vases. The Ahar culture also had equally distinctive brightly slipped Red Ware, a Tan ware, ceramics in Burnished Black that were incised Thin Red ware, as well as incised and otherwise decorated Gray ware fabrics. The pottery had a black top and reddish bottom, with paintings in white on the black surface. Because of these distinctive features, Ahar, when it was first noticed by R C Agrawal, was called the \\"black and red ware culture\\". This is in a way true, because this was primarily the pottery used by the inhabitants of Ahar for drinking and eating. They used fine and deluxe table-ware like the china-ware or stainless steel we use today. However, a subsequent and more extensive excavation showed that the Ahar people produced other kinds of fine and distinctive pottery as well.

The duo met in middle school and started making music shortly thereafter. The name \\"The Working Hour\\" is the name of a Tears for Fears song and serves as a tribute to one of the band's earlier influences. The band's debut album Unbreakable was produced by Paul Mahern and features indie-rock musicians Vess Ruhtenberg of The Lemonheads and The Pieces, Andy York of John Mellencamp's band, Courtney Kaiser and producer Ken Rose. Americana and piano pop are also heard in The Working Hour's sound. History Early years (2003‚Äì08) The Working Hour found early popularity through a string of midwest touring and a high usage of Web 2.0 promotional tools such as MySpace, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter. The band became one of the first to see a large growth of fan base and trend nationally on the Tumblr blogging platform. In late 2007, The Working Hour released a free digital-only EP titled Brave Rave EP. The album was created in what member Peter Doherty considered a \\"musically exploratory\\" time and thus featured non-standard song structures and many 1980s synthpop influences. Throughout 2008, The Working Hour performed many times with Wind- Up Records recording artists Company of Thieves. Unbreakable (2009) The Working Hour's debut LP Unbreakable was released on iTunes and in stores on May 22, 2009.. \\"iTunes\\" Nov 2, 2009. The band had struggled to find a sound until late 2008 when the final sonic quality was established. While the album's content spans over two years, it was recorded from November 2008 to February 2009 in various Bloomington, Indiana, Indianapolis, Indiana and London, England studios by The Working Hour and producer Paul Mahern. The album was promoted though a summer 2009 tour and various media appearances including 91.3 WWHI-FM, 89.3FM WJEL and more. The songs Independence Day and Careful from Unbreakable were licensed in the 2009 British romantic comedy, Mr. Right. The album is what the band describes as \\"partial concept album\\" about lead singer Andrew Riesmeyer's failed relationship with his ex- girlfriend. \\"Unbreakable\\" has become one of the highest selling Indiana-made records at Luna Music stores. The album has received high praises from Indianapolis music magazine Nuvo who featured an in-depth article about the band in their July 15, 2009 issue. The Working Hour headlined a rock club tour in 2009 and in 2010 opened for Jack Johnson, Rooney and Hanson on the Shout it Out Tour. New Record Since early 2010, The Working Hour has been working in the studio during breaks from touring with producer Jim Wirt who produced Jack's Mannequin, Incubus, and Fiona Apple. In mid-2010, the band announced their relocation to Los Angeles, CA for the completion of their second full- length record to be released sometime in 2011. The first single from the upcoming record titled \\"Stay Here\\" was debuted in the summer of 2010 through the band's various web accounts.

Moreno Museum of Patagonia, Bariloche One of the rooms in the museum Patagonic fauna exhibit The Francisco P. Moreno Museum of Patagonia is a natural history and cultural anthropology museum located in the Civic Center of Bariloche, Argentina. Overview The museum was inaugurated on March 17, 1940, as part of the unveiling of the Bariloche Civic Center, which was commissioned by the national government as part of an effort to promote the then-remote R√≠o Negro Province ski resort town. The museum, and its accompanying Domingo Sarmiento Public Library and Bariloche City Hall, were designed by Ernesto de Estrada. Built from polished green tuff, cypress and fitzroya, with slate roofing, the buildings are centered by a plaza put down entirely in flagstone pavers. The majority of its collections were requisitioned from the National Parks Adeministration by the museum's first director, Enrique Artayeta. Named in honor of Argentine surveyor and academic Francisco Moreno, the institution was organized in the tradition of the La Plata Museum, whose 1888 establishment was owed in large measure to the renowned explorer. Expanded and modernized during a 1992 restoration, the museum's collections are divided by a number of categorized halls: *Natural Sciences: a collection of fossils and geological findings. *Prehistory: informative dioramas and stratigraphy displays, as well as relics from Stone Age cultures in the area. *Aboriginal History: displays pertaining to the Mapuche, Selknam, Tehuelche and Y√°mana cultures, including implements used in astronomy. *Regional History: exhibits tracing Patagonian history from the early years of Spanish colonization of the Americas to the time of the Argentine War of Independence *The Conquest of the Desert: illustrating the tools, arms, and methods used by Argentine governments from Juan Manuel de Rosas' to Julio Roca's in their 19th-century campaigns to displace native peoples, as well as those used by native caciques in their counteroffensives. *San Carlos de Bariloche: exhibits relating to local history, from the town's establishment in 1885, to its promotion by Public Works Minister Ezequiel Ramos Mex√≠a after 1905 and its later development. *National Parks: documents, diagrams, and maps pertaining to the development of National parks in Argentina, among which Bariloche's Lake Nahuel Huapi was the first. *Francisco Moreno: an exhibit honoring the museum's namesake, the noted surveyor and academic who donated Lake Nahuel Huapi and its surroundings in 1903 to create the nation's first national park. The museum also includes a hall for temporary exhibits, an auditorium, workshop, library and archives, as well as facilities for curators and researchers. The Bariloche Civic Center, including the museum, was declared a National Historic Monument in 1987. References and external links *Museo de la Patagonia Francisco P.

The edulis part of the Latin name refers to its edible shoots. This bamboo can reach heights of up to . This particular species of bamboo is the most common species used in the bamboo textile industry of China, for the production of rayon. Ecology Phyllostachys edulis spreads using both asexual and sexual reproduction. The most common and well known mode for this plant is asexual reproduction. This occurs when the plant sends up new culms from underground rhizomes. The culms grow quickly and reach a height of 90 ft or more (depending on the age and health of the plant). In mature individuals, the culms in young plants grow taller and wider in diameter as the general plant reaches maturity, but once the individual culm stops growing it will not grow again. P. edulis also flowers and produces seed, and it does so every half century or so, but it has a sporadic flowering nature rather than the synchronous blooming seen in some other bamboo species. The seeds fall from the mature culms in the hundreds of thousands and are quick to germinate. Mice, field rats and other rodents take notice of the bounty of seed, this results in the loss of many of the seeds, but within a few weeks the surviving few seeds would have germinated (see Predator satiation). The first culm from a seedling will not get much taller than a few inches at most, and may be as thin as 2mm, but with every new season of culms sent up from developing rhizomes, the grove of plants will grow in height and cane diameter. Polyporus phyllostachydis (Sotome, T. Hatt. & Kakish.), is a fungus species known from Japan, that grows on the ground on the living or dead roots of the bamboo. Cultivation  Cultivars  Cultivars include: * Phyllostachys edulis 'Bicolor' * Phyllostachys edulis 'Kikko' or 'Kikko-Chiku' (Syn.: Phyllostachys edulis var. heterocycla) * Phyllostachys edulis 'Subconvexa' (Syn.: Phyllostachys heterocycla f. subconvexa, Phyllostachys pubescens 'Subconvexa') * Phyllostachys edulis 'Nabeshimana', (Syn.: Phyllostachys heterocycla f. nabeshimana, Phyllostachys pubescens f. luteosulcata) Cultivation in the United States In 2016 OnlyMoso USA initiated large scale commercial farming of Phyllostachys edulis in the United States, in the state of Florida, becoming the first entity to grow Moso bamboo from seedlings in large scale in the USA, including the development of nurseries to ensure a constant supply of viable plants for bamboo farmers.

A formation of the part-time Militia, the brigade was formed in 1921 as the 5th Cavalry Brigade. At this time, it consisted of three light horse regiments based in Victoria. The brigade ceased to exist in 1936 due to manpower shortages, but was re-raised during World War II, in April 1942, as a motor brigade. It was quickly disbanded, however, and was used to raise the 6th Armoured Brigade in June 1942, without having seen combat. History The 5th Cavalry Brigade was raised as a formation of the part-time Militia in 1921. Forming part of the 2nd Cavalry Division, its headquarters was established in Melbourne, in Victoria. It consisted of three light horse regiments: the 4th, 17th and 19th Light Horse Regiments. These regiments were spread between Warrnambool (4th), Bendigo (17th) and Ballarat (19th), and were drawn from areas previously assigned to the 6th and 7th Light Horse Brigades, which had been disbanded when Australia's part-time mounted units were re-formed as cavalry brigades. At this time, the force was maintained using a mix of voluntary enlistment and compulsory service. The brigade ceased to exist in October 1936, due to manpower shortages following the suspension of the compulsory service scheme in the early 1930s. By 1938, the brigade's regiments had been reassigned to the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, with the 4th and 19th having been amalgamated, and the 17th having been converted into a machine gun regiment. During the early part of World War II, the Australian Army undertook a modernisation program to motorise or mechanise its mounted forces, at which time many light horse regiments were issued vehicles and re-roled. As a result, the brigade was formed in April 1942 at Geelong, Victoria, as a motor brigade, tasked with the defence of Australia. Assigned to the 2nd Motor Division ‚Äì which had been converted from the 2nd Cavalry Division ‚Äì the brigade initially consisted of three motor regiments: the 13th, 17th and 104th.

Formed in February 1942 from the previously existing 6th Cavalry Brigade, the brigade undertook defensive duties in Victoria before being converted into an armoured formation in May 1942. History The 6th Motor Brigade was descended from the Adelaide-based 6th Cavalry Brigade, which was formed from the existing 8th Light Horse Brigade in the reorganisation of the Army in 1921.Hall 1968, pp. 76‚Äì77 Upon the declaration of war in 1939, the brigade was placed on a war footing. Following the invasion of Malaya, bombing of Pearl Harbor and fall of Singapore, the 6th was called up for full-time service, carrying out defensive duties in Australia. The evolution of Australia's mounted forces, the Australian Light Horse, had lagged well behind that of other countries who had converted their horse mounted cavalry to motorised (trucks) or mechanised (armoured fighting vehicles) forces in the 1930s and 1940s, but the advent of war provided the impetus for change.Morrison 2006, p. 61 In the early phase of the war, the brigade was tasked with forming a district reserve, and defending positions along the Onkaparinga and Stuart Rivers, in South Australia. Consequently, the 6th Cavalry Brigade became the 6th Motor Brigade in February 1942, and its subordinate units were also motorised.McKenzie-Smith 2018, p. 2120. The 3rd, 9th and 18th Light Horse regiments were directed to reorganise and re-equip as \\"motor regiments\\", which were effectively lorry/truck borne motorised infantry, similar to the British Motor Battalions, US Armoured Infantry or German Panzer Grenadier units.Morrison 2006, pp. 69‚Äì71. The 3rd Motor Regiment was formed from two reconnaissance squadrons ‚Äì the 3rd and 23rd ‚Äì while the 18th was converted from a light horse machine gun regiment. The brigade's existence proved short lived and most units never completed the process of motorisation. As part of the broader mechanisation and motorisation of the 2nd Motor Division, which would become the 2nd Armoured Division, the 6th Cavalry Brigade was converted to a mechanised formation, the 6th Armoured Brigade in May 1942. They subsequently joined the 3rd Motor Brigade and other divisional troops, in Victoria, concentrating in Gherang, Victoria in June before moving to Puckapunyal in July to begin receiving armoured vehicles.McKenzie-Smith 2018, pp. 2120‚Äì2121.

The oldest parts of the crown are the orb and cross at the top, which date to the 16th century. The diadem was made around 1660, and the arches were added around 1770. The crown is adorned with 450 emeralds, the largest of which is the \\"Atahualpa Emerald\\"; this might have belonged to Incan Emperor Atahualpa (1497‚Äì1533) and been seized from him when he was captured in 1532 by Francisco Pizarro, a Spanish conquistador. In 1936, the crown was sold by its owners to an American businessman and it has remained in the United States ever since. As of December 2015, the crown belongs to the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.Metropolitan Museum of Art website  Description  The crown is high with a body diameter of , and weighs . It is made from 18‚Äì22 carat gold, ' and chased. There are 450 emeralds on it: the largest, known as the \\"Atahualpa Emerald\\", is a rectangular stone measuring by .  History  Various tales circulate about the construction and origin of the Crown of the Andes. According to the conventional account, it was made in the 1590s in gratitude for the city of Popay√°n after being spared an outbreak of smallpox which was devastating the region. It includes emeralds purportedly taken from Incan Emperor Atahualpa. However, Christopher Hartop is a jewellery expert who examined the crown during a proposed sale at Christie's in New York in 1995, and he suggested that it was a composite piece. He dated the little cross at the top to the 16th century, with the bottom half being completed in the 17th century and the intersecting arches dating to the 18th century. The Crown had a long history of use in the Holy Week celebrations in Popay√°n, until the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception (La Cofrad√≠a de la Inmaculada Concepci√≥n) sought papal permission to sell it in the early decades of the 20th century, dedicating the funds to charitable purposes. Permission was given in 1914, but the sellers did not find a buyer until 1936 when an American syndicate purchased it, led by Chicago businessman Warren J. Piper. Piper said that the crown would be broken up and the jewels sold individually, but this did not happen. Instead, it was exhibited sporadically over the next few decades, notably at Detroit in 1937 when General Motors used it at the unveiling of their new Chevrolet models. 225,000 people are said to have viewed it on that occasion, some 15% of the city's population. It was also displayed at the 1939 New York World's Fair and in 1959 at the Royal Ontario Museum. The Crown was not sold during the 1995 sale. Afterwards, it was usually kept in New York, put on display in Indianapolis at an exhibition called Sacred Spain: Art and Belief in the Spanish World held from October 2009 to January 2010 at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Its acquisition was announced by the Metropolitan Museum in New York in December 2015. It was acquired and exported legally, but it was made in Popay√°n from local gold and emeralds and used there continually in religious worship for three centuries, and the Instituto Distrital de Cultura y Turismo of Colombia has suggested that it should be returned to the region where it has the most cultural significance.

Its headquarters are in Madrid, Spain. Functions men's 10 kilometre marathon swim at the 2012 Olympic Games. As Host Broadcaster, OBS is responsible for delivering the pictures and sounds of the Olympic and Paralympic Games to billions of viewers around the world. It produces and transmits unbiased live radio and television coverage of every sport from every venue. This feed is called the International Signal or the World Feed and is distributed as a service to all broadcast organisations who have purchased the television and radio rights to the Games (known as Rights Holding Broadcasters or RHBs). In collaboration with the Local Organising Committee, OBS supervises the development of the necessary infrastructures (including the International Broadcast Centre (IBC) which serves as the primary base of the broadcast operation for OBS and the RHBs during the Games) and facilities at the different Olympic venues to ensure the successful broadcast production of the Games. OBS also offers additional services, equipment and supplies to the RHBs to help them produce their unilateral production. History The 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing marked the first time OBS was involved as Host Broadcaster. Previously the host broadcaster role was delegated to the local organising committees or to third-party broadcasters, having to rebuild the broadcast operation in each edition. Athens 2004 Beijing 2008 Its operations began with the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where Beijing Olympic Broadcasting, a joint venture between OBS and the Beijing Organizing Committee, acted as the host broadcasting consortium and the state television network, China Central Television which is one of the host nation broadcasters of the games. Vancouver 2010 For the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, a wholly owned division, Olympic Broadcasting Services Vancouver was set up. The 2010 Olympics marked the first Games where the host broadcasting facilities were provided solely by OBS. London 2012 The 2012 Olympic Games were broadcast by OBS. More than 5,600+ hours of live sports, ceremonies and Olympic News Channel content were distributed to the Rights Holding Broadcasters. OBS employed 1,000+ HD cameras, including 40 High Super Slow Motion cameras and other innovative specialty equipment such as 3D cameras, Super High Vision cameras and the world‚Äôs longest cablecam which stretched 2,340m at the Rowing venue from start to finish. Sochi 2014 The Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games represented the largest broadcast operation in history for a Winter Games. OBS deployed more than 450 cameras, including 12 cablecam systems, 31 High Speed Slow Motion (HSSM) cameras and a multicopter/drone used for the first time, to ultimately produce 1300+ hours of television. In total, 464 television channels broadcast the Sochi Games, almost double the number from Vancouver, and more digital platforms offered coverage than at any previous Winter Games with 155 websites and 75 apps showing events live from Russia. Thanks to the increased number of channels and digital platforms for Sochi 2014, there were more hours broadcast globally than any previous Winter Games with more than 100,000 hours broadcast around the world, compared with 57,000 for Vancouver 2010. For the first time in Olympic history, the amount of digital coverage exceeded traditional television broadcasts with 60,000 hours available on digital platforms, compared with 42,000 hours on television. These were the first predominantly digital Olympic Games and OBS helped fuel the significant increase in digital coverage by launching, for the first time in Sochi, the Olympic Video Player (OVP). Available in 95 countries, the OVP provided a fully integrated data, a news channel, live streams and on-demand video. Rio 2016 Rio 2016 represented the most television coverage of any previous Olympic Games, with nearly 350,000 total hours broadcast globally, far exceeding the 200,000 hours that were broadcast for the London 2012 Games. Additionally, coverage was aired across more platforms than ever before, as more than 500 television channels and 250 digital outlets conveyed the Olympic Games around the world. The number of hours of coverage available on digital platforms nearly doubled that of traditional television, representing more than two and a half times of what was achieved for London 2012 (218,000 hours versus 81,500 hours), marking a milestone in the history of Olympic broadcasting. Representing the largest host broadcast operation to date, Rio involved more than 7,200 OBS personnel. Further, having developed a production plan to cover all 28 Olympic sports, including new additions Golf and Rugby Sevens, OBS drew on more than 1,000 cameras for the coverage of the Rio Games. Rio also marked the first time Olympic content was available in Virtual Reality (VR). Overall, OBS produced more than 85 hours of live VR coverage, captured by custom-developed 360-degree camera systems, to a total of 14 RHB organisations, representing 31 territories. OBS and Japanese Rights Holder NHK continued their collaboration on 4K/8K Super Hi-Vision (SHV) technology and produced approximately 100 hours of live coverage for Rio, featuring 22.2-channel surround sound.

Here, the first three are connected to a power supply, and they light up (A). This indicates that the broken bulb must be one of the last three (B). If instead the bulbs did not light up, one could be sure that the broken bulb was among the first three. Continuing this procedure can locate the broken bulb in no more than three tests, compared to a maximum of six tests if the bulbs are checked individually. In statistics and combinatorial mathematics, group testing is any procedure that breaks up the task of identifying certain objects into tests on groups of items, rather than on individual ones. First studied by Robert Dorfman in 1943, group testing is a relatively new field of applied mathematics that can be applied to a wide range of practical applications and is an active area of research today. A familiar example of group testing involves a string of light bulbs connected in series, where exactly one of the bulbs is known to be broken. The objective is to find the broken bulb using the smallest number of tests (where a test is when some of the bulbs are connected to a power supply). A simple approach is to test each bulb individually. However, when there are a large number of bulbs it would be much more efficient to pool the bulbs into groups. For example, by connecting the first half of the bulbs at once, it can be determined which half the broken bulb is in, ruling out half of the bulbs in just one test. Schemes for carrying out group testing can be simple or complex and the tests involved at each stage may be different. Schemes in which the tests for the next stage depend on the results of the previous stages are called adaptive procedures, while schemes designed so that all the tests are known beforehand are called non-adaptive procedures. The structure of the scheme of the tests involved in a non-adaptive procedure is known as a pooling design. Group testing has many applications, including statistics, biology, computer science, medicine, engineering and cyber security. Modern interest in these testing schemes has been rekindled by the Human Genome Project.  Basic description and terms  Unlike many areas of mathematics, the origins of group testing can be traced back to a single report written by a single person: Robert Dorfman. The motivation arose during the Second World War when the United States Public Health Service and the Selective service embarked upon a large-scale project to weed out all syphilitic men called up for induction. Testing an individual for syphilis involves drawing a blood sample from them and then analysing the sample to determine the presence or absence of syphilis. At the time, performing this test was expensive, and testing every soldier individually would have been very expensive and inefficient. Supposing there are n soldiers, this method of testing leads to n separate tests. If a large proportion of the people are infected then this method would be reasonable. However, in the more likely case that only a very small proportion of the men are infected, a much more efficient testing scheme can be achieved. The feasibility of a more effective testing scheme hinges on the following property: the soldiers can be pooled into groups, and in each group the blood samples can be combined together. The combined sample can then be tested to check if at least one soldier in the group has syphilis. This is the central idea behind group testing. If one or more of the soldiers in this group has syphilis, then a test is wasted (more tests need to be performed to find which soldier(s) it was). On the other hand, if no one in the pool has syphilis then many tests are saved, since every soldier in that group can be eliminated with just one test. The items that cause a group to test positive are generally called defective items (these are the broken lightbulbs, syphilitic men, etc.). Often, the total number of items is denoted as n and d represents the number of defectives if it is assumed to be known.  Classification of group-testing problems  There are two independent classifications for group-testing problems; every group-testing problem is either adaptive or non-adaptive, and either probabilistic or combinatorial. In probabilistic models, the defective items are assumed to follow some probability distribution and the aim is to minimise the expected number of tests needed to identify the defectiveness of every item. On the other hand, with combinatorial group testing, the goal is to minimise the number of tests needed in a 'worst-case scenario' ‚Äì that is, create a minmax algorithm ‚Äì and no knowledge of the distribution of defectives is assumed. The other classification, adaptivity, concerns what information can be used when choosing which items to group into a test. In general, the choice of which items to test can depend on the results of previous tests, as in the above lightbulb problem. An algorithm that proceeds by performing a test, and then using the result (and all past results) to decide which next test to perform, is called adaptive. Conversely, in non-adaptive algorithms, all tests are decided in advance. This idea can be generalised to multistage algorithms, where tests are divided into stages, and every test in the next stage must be decided in advance, with only the knowledge of the results of tests in previous stages. Although adaptive algorithms offer much more freedom in design, it is known that adaptive group-testing algorithms do not improve upon non-adaptive ones by more than a constant factor in the number of tests required to identify the set of defective items. In addition to this, non- adaptive methods are often useful in practice because one can proceed with successive tests without first analysing the results of all previous tests, allowing for the effective distribution of the testing process.  Variations and extensions  There are many ways to extend the problem of group testing. One of the most important is called noisy group testing, and deals with a big assumption of the original problem: that testing is error-free. A group- testing problem is called noisy when there is some chance that the result of a group test is erroneous (e.g. comes out positive when the test contained no defectives). The Bernoulli noise model assumes this probability is some constant, q, but in general it can depend on the true number of defectives in the test and the number of items tested. For example, the effect of dilution can be modelled by saying a positive result is more likely when there are more defectives (or more defectives as a fraction of the number tested), present in the test. A noisy algorithm will always have a non-zero probability of making an error (that is, mislabeling an item). Group testing can be extended by considering scenarios in which there are more than two possible outcomes of a test. For example, a test may have the outcomes 0, 1 and 2^+, corresponding to there being no defectives, a single defective, or an unknown number of defectives larger than one. More generally, it is possible to consider the outcome-set of a test to be {0, 1, \\\\ldots , k^+} for some k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}. Another extension is to consider geometric restrictions on which sets can be tested. The above lightbulb problem is an example of this kind of restriction: only bulbs that appear consecutively can be tested. Similarly, the items may be arranged in a circle, or in general, a net, where the tests are available paths on the graph. Another kind of geometric restriction would be on the maximum number of items that can be tested in a group, or the group sizes might have to be even and so on. In a similar way, it may be useful to consider the restriction that any given item can only appear in a certain number of tests. There are endless ways to continue remixing the basic formula of group testing. The following elaborations will give an idea of some of the more exotic variants. In the 'good‚Äìmediocre‚Äìbad' model, each item is one of 'good', 'mediocre' or 'bad', and the result of a test is the type of the 'worst' item in the group. In threshold group testing, the result of a test is positive if the number of defective items in the group is greater than some threshold value or proportion. Group testing with inhibitors is a variant with applications in molecular biology. Here, there is a third class of items called inhibitors, and the result of a test is positive if it contains at least one defective and no inhibitors.  History and development   Invention and initial progress  The concept of group testing was first introduced by Robert Dorfman in 1943 in a short report published in the Notes section of Annals of Mathematical Statistics. Dorfman's report ‚Äì as with all the early work on group testing ‚Äì focused on the probabilistic problem, and aimed to use the novel idea of group testing to reduce the expected number of tests needed to weed out all syphilitic men in a given pool of soldiers. The method was simple: put the soldiers into groups of a given size, and use individual testing (testing items in groups of size one) on the positive groups to find which were infected. Dorfman tabulated the optimum group sizes for this strategy against the prevalence rate of defectiveness in the population. After 1943, group testing remained largely untouched for a number of years. Then in 1957, Sterrett produced an improvement on Dorfman's procedure. This newer process starts by again performing individual testing on the positive groups, but stopping as soon as a defective is identified. Then, the remaining items in the group are tested together, since it is very likely that none of them are defective. The first thorough treatment of group testing was given by Sobel and Groll in their formative 1959 paper on the subject. They described five new procedures ‚Äì in addition to generalisations for when the prevalence rate is unknown ‚Äì and for the most optimal one, they provided an explicit formula for the expected number of tests it would use. The paper also made the connection between group testing and information theory for the first time, as well as discussing several generalisations of the group-testing problem and providing some new applications of the theory.  Combinatorial group testing  Group testing was first studied in the combinatorial context by Li in 1962, with the introduction of Li‚Äôs s-stage algorithm. Li proposed an extension of Dorfman's '2-stage algorithm' to an arbitrary number of stages that required no more than t = \\\\frac{e}{\\\\log_2(e)}d \\\\log_2(n) tests to be guaranteed to find d or fewer defectives among n items. The idea was to remove all the items in negative tests, and divide the remaining items into groups as was done with the initial pool. This was to be done s - 1 times before performing individual testing. Combinatorial group testing in general was later studied more fully by Katona in 1973. Katona introduced the matrix representation of non-adaptive group-testing and produced a procedure for finding the defective in the non-adaptive 1-defective case in no more than t =\\\\lceil \\\\log_2(n) \\\\rceiltests, which he also proved to be optimal. In general, finding optimal algorithms for adaptive combinatorial group testing is difficult, and although the computational complexity of group testing has not been determined, it is suspected to be hard in some complexity class. However, an important breakthrough occurred in 1972, with the introduction of the generalised binary-splitting algorithm. The generalised binary-splitting algorithm works by performing a binary search on groups that test positive, and is a simple algorithm that finds a single defective in no more than the information-lower-bound number of tests. In scenarios where there are two or more defectives, the generalised binary-splitting algorithm still produces near-optimal results, requiring at most d - 1 tests above the information lower bound where d is the number of defectives. Considerable improvements to this were made in 2013 by Allemann, getting the required number of tests to less than 0.187d + 0.5\\\\log_2(d) + 5.5 above the information lower bound when n/d \\\\geq 38 and d \\\\geq 10. This was achieved by changing the binary search in the binary-splitting algorithm to a complex set of sub-algorithms with overlapping test groups. As such, the problem of adaptive combinatorial group testing ‚Äì with a known number or upper bound on the number of defectives ‚Äì has essentially been solved, with little room for further improvement. There is an open question as to when individual testing is minmax. Hu, Hwang and Wang showed in 1981 that individual testing is minmax when n \\\\leq \\\\lfloor (5d + 1)/2 \\\\rfloor, and that it is not minmax when n > 3d. It is currently conjectured that this bound is sharp: that is, individual testing is minmax if and only if n \\\\leq 3d. Some progress was made in 2000 by Ricccio and Colbourn, who showed that for large n, individual testing is minmax when d \\\\geq n/\\\\log_{3/2}(3) \\\\approx 0.369n.  Non-adaptive and probabilistic testing  One of the key insights in non-adaptive group testing is that significant gains can be made by eliminating the requirement that the group-testing procedure be certain to succeed (the \\"combinatorial\\" problem), but rather permit it to have some low but non-zero probability of mis-labelling each item (the \\"probabilistic\\" problem). It is known that as the number of defective items approaches the total number of items, exact combinatorial solutions require significantly more tests than probabilistic solutions ‚Äî even probabilistic solutions permitting only an asymptotically small probability of error. In this vein, Chan et al. (2011) introduced COMP, a probabilistic algorithm that requires no more than t = ed(1+\\\\delta)\\\\ln(n) tests to find up to d defectives in n items with a probability of error no more than n^{-\\\\delta}. This is within a constant factor of the t = O(d\\\\log_2 n) lower bound. Chan et al. (2011) also provided a generalisation of COMP to a simple noisy model, and similarly produced an explicit performance bound, which was again only a constant (dependent on the likelihood of a failed test) above the corresponding lower bound. In general, the number of tests required in the Bernoulli noise case is a constant factor larger than in the noiseless case. Aldridge, Baldassini and Johnson (2014) produced an extension of the COMP algorithm that added additional post-processing steps. They showed that the performance of this new algorithm, called DD, strictly exceeds that of COMP, and that DD is 'essentially optimal' in scenarios where d^2 \\\\geq n, by comparing it to a hypothetical algorithm that defines a reasonable optimum. The performance of this hypothetical algorithm suggests that there is room for improvement when d^2 < n, as well as suggesting how much improvement this might be.  Formalisation of combinatorial group testing  This section formally defines the notions and terms relating to group testing. *The input vector, \\\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_n), is defined to be a binary vector of length n (that is, \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n), with the j-th item being called defective if and only if x_j= 1. Further, any non-defective item is called a 'good' item. \\\\mathbf{x} is intended to describe the (unknown) set of defective items. The key property of \\\\mathbf{x} is that it is an implicit input. That is to say, there is no direct knowledge of what the entries of \\\\mathbf{x} are, other than that which can be inferred via some series of 'tests'. This leads on to the next definition. *Let \\\\mathbf{x} be an input vector. A set, S \\\\subseteq \\\\\\\\{ 1, 2, \\\\dots, n \\\\\\\\} is called a test. When testing is noiseless, the result of a test is positive when there exists j \\\\in S such that x_j = 1, and the result is negative otherwise. Therefore, the goal of group testing is to come up with a method for choosing a 'short' series of tests that allow \\\\mathbf{x} to be determined, either exactly or with a high degree of certainty. *A group-testing algorithm is said to make an error if it incorrectly labels an item (that is, labels any defective item as non- defective or vice versa). This is not the same thing as the result of a group test being incorrect. An algorithm is called zero-error if the probability that it makes an error is zero. *t(d, n) denotes the minimum number of tests required to always find d defectives among n items with zero probability of error by any group-testing algorithm. For the same quantity but with the restriction that the algorithm is non-adaptive, the notation \\\\bar{t}(d, n) is used.  General bounds  Since it is always possible to resort to individual testing by setting S_j = \\\\\\\\{j\\\\\\\\} for each 1 \\\\leq j \\\\leq n, it must be that that \\\\bar{t}(d, n) \\\\leq n. Also, since any non-adaptive testing procedure can be written as an adaptive algorithm by simply performing all the tests without regard to their outcome, t(d, n) \\\\leq \\\\bar{t}(d, n). Finally, when 0 eq d eq n, there is at least one item whose defectiveness must be determined (by at least one test), and so 1 \\\\leq t(d, n). In summary (when assuming 0 eq d eq n), 1 \\\\leq t(d,n) \\\\leq \\\\bar{t}(d, n) \\\\leq n . = Information lower bound = A lower bound on the number of tests needed can be described using the notion of sample space, denoted \\\\mathcal{S}, which is simply the set of possible placements of defectives. For any group testing problem with sample space \\\\mathcal{S} and any group-testing algorithm, it can be shown that t \\\\geq \\\\lceil \\\\log_2{\\\\mathcal{S}} \\\\rceil, where t is the minimum number of tests required to identify all defectives with a zero probability of error. This is called the information lower bound. This bound is derived from the fact that after each test, \\\\mathcal{S} is split into two disjoint subsets, each corresponding to one of the two possible outcomes of the test. However, the information lower bound itself is usually unachievable, even for small problems. This is because the splitting of \\\\mathcal{S} is not arbitrary, since it must be realisable by some test. In fact, the information lower bound can be generalised to the case where there is a non-zero probability that the algorithm makes an error. In this form, the theorem gives us an upper bound on the probability of success based on the number of tests. For any group-testing algorithm that performs t tests, the probability of success, \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\textrm{success}), satisfies \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\textrm{success}) \\\\leq t/\\\\log_2{n \\\\choose d}. This can be strengthened to: \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\textrm{success}) \\\\leq \\\\frac{2^t}.  Representation of non- adaptive algorithms  alt=A diagram showing a group testing matrix along with associated vectors, x and y. Algorithms for non-adaptive group testing consist of two distinct phases. First, it is decided how many tests to perform and which items to include in each test. In the second phase, often called the decoding step, the results of each group test are analysed to determine which items are likely to be defective. The first phase is usually encoded in a matrix as follows. *Suppose a non-adaptive group testing procedure for n items consists of the tests S_1, S_2, \\\\dots, S_t for some t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}_{\\\\geq 0}. The testing matrix for this scheme is the t \\\\times n binary matrix, M, where (M)_{ij} = 1 if and only if j \\\\in S_i (and is zero otherwise). Thus each column of M represents an item and each row represents a test, with a 1 in the (i,j)\\\\textrm{-th} entry indicating that the i\\\\textrm{-th} test included the j\\\\textrm{-th} item and a 0 indicating otherwise. As well as the vector \\\\mathbf{x} (of length n) that describes the unknown defective set, it is common to introduce the result vector, which describes the results of each test. *Let t be the number of tests performed by a non-adaptive algorithm. The result vector, \\\\mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2, \\\\dots, y_t), is a binary vector of length t (that is, \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^t) such that y_i= 1 if and only if the result of the i\\\\textrm{-th} test was positive (i.e. contained at least one defective). With these definitions, the non-adaptive problem can be reframed as follows: first a testing matrix is chosen, M, after which the vector \\\\mathbf{y} is returned. Then the problem is to analyse \\\\mathbf{y} to find some estimate for \\\\mathbf{x}. In the simplest noisy case, where there is a constant probability, q, that a group test will have an erroneous result, one considers a random binary vector, \\\\mathbf{v}, where each entry has a probability q of being 1, and is 0 otherwise. The vector that is returned is then \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{y}} = \\\\mathbf{y} + \\\\mathbf{v}, with the usual addition on (\\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z})^n (equivalently this is the element-wise XOR operation). A noisy algorithm must estimate \\\\mathbf{x} using \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{y}} (that is, without direct knowledge of \\\\mathbf{y}).  Bounds for non-adaptive algorithms  The matrix representation makes it possible to prove some bounds on non-adaptive group testing. The approach mirrors that of many deterministic designs, where d-separable matrices are considered, as defined below. *A binary matrix, M, is called d-separable if every Boolean sum (logical OR) of any d of its columns is distinct. Additionally, the notation \\\\bar{d}-separable indicates that every sum of any of up to d of M's columns is distinct. (This is not the same as M being k-separable for every k \\\\leq d.) When M is a testing matrix, the property of being d-separable (\\\\bar{d}-separable) is equivalent to being able to distinguish between (up to) d defectives. However, it does not guarantee that this will be straightforward. A stronger property, called d-disjunctness does. *A binary matrix, M is called d-disjunct if the Boolean sum of any d columns does not contain any other column. (In this context, a column A is said to contain a column B if for every index where B has a 1, A also has a 1.) A useful property of d-disjunct testing matrices is that, with up to d defectives, every non-defective item will appear in at least one test whose outcome is negative. This means there is a simple procedure for finding the defectives: just remove every item that appears in a negative test. Using the properties of d-separable and d-disjunct matrices the following can be shown for the problem of identifying d defectives among n total items. #The number of tests needed for an asymptotically small average probability of error scales as O(d\\\\log_2 n). #The number of tests needed for an asymptotically small maximum probability of error scales as O(d^2 \\\\log_2 n). #The number of tests needed for a zero probability of error scales as O \\\\left(\\\\frac{d^2 \\\\log_2 n}{\\\\log_2 d} \\\\right).  Generalised binary-splitting algorithm  An illustration of the generalised binary-splitting algorithm where there are 8 defectives and 135 total items. Here, 2^{\\\\alpha_1} = 16, and the first test gives a negative result so every item is declared non-defective. Hence there are 119 remaining items, so 2^{\\\\alpha_2} = 8. This second group gives a positive result, so a binary search is used to find a defective. Once that is done, the whole process is repeated, calculating a new \\\\alpha using only those items whose defectiveness has not been determined. The generalised binary-splitting algorithm is an essentially-optimal adaptive group-testing algorithm that finds d or fewer defectives among n items as follows: # If n \\\\leq 2d - 2, test the n items individually. Otherwise, set l = n - d + 1 and \\\\alpha = \\\\lfloor \\\\log_2{l/d} \\\\rfloor. # Test a group of size 2^\\\\alpha. If the outcome is negative, every item in the group is declared to be non-defective; set n := n - 2^\\\\alpha and go to step 1. Otherwise, use a binary search to identify one defective and an unspecified number, called x, of non-defective items; set n := n - 1 - x and d := d - 1. Go to step 1. The generalised binary-splitting algorithm requires no more than T tests where T = \\\\begin{cases} n & n \\\\leq 2d-2\\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\\alpha+2)d + p - 1 & n \\\\geq 2d - 1 \\\\end{cases} . For n/d large, it can be shown that T \\\\rightarrow d \\\\log_2(n/d), which compares favorably to the t = \\\\frac{e}{\\\\log_2 e}d\\\\log_2 \\\\left( \\\\frac{n}{d} \\\\right) tests required for Li's s-stage algorithm. In fact, the generalised binary-splitting algorithm is close to optimal in the following sense. When d \\\\geq 2 it can be shown that T - B_I(d,n) \\\\leq (d-1), where B_I(d,n) = \\\\left\\\\lceil \\\\log_2 \\\\sum_{i=0}^d {n \\\\choose i} \\\\right\\\\rceil is the information lower bound.  Non-adaptive algorithms  Non-adaptive group-testing algorithms tend to assume that the number of defectives, or at least a good upper bound on them, is known. This quantity is denoted d in this section. If no bounds are known, there are non- adaptive algorithms with low query complexity that can help estimate d.  Combinatorial orthogonal matching pursuit (COMP)  An illustration of the COMP algorithm. COMP identifies item a as being defective and item b as being non-defective. However, it incorrectly labels c as a defective, since it is ‚Äúhidden‚Äù by defective items in every test in which it appears. Combinatorial Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, or COMP, is a simple non-adaptive group-testing algorithm that forms the basis for the more complicated algorithms that follow in this section. First, each entry of the testing matrix is chosen i.i.d. to be 1 with probability 1/d and 0 otherwise. The decoding step proceeds column- wise (i.e. by item). If every test in which an item appears is positive, then the item is declared defective; otherwise the item is assumed to be non- defective. Or equivalently, if an item appears in any test whose outcome is negative, the item is declared non-defective; otherwise the item is assumed to be defective. An important property of this algorithm is that it never creates false negatives, though a false positive occurs when all locations with ones in the j-th column of M (corresponding to a non-defective item j) are \\"hidden\\" by the ones of other columns corresponding to defective items. The COMP algorithm requires no more than ed(1 + \\\\delta) \\\\ln(n) tests to have an error probability less than or equal to n^{-\\\\delta}. This is within a constant factor of the lower bound for the average probability of error above. In the noisy case, one relaxes the requirement in the original COMP algorithm that the set of locations of ones in any column of M corresponding to a positive item be entirely contained in the set of locations of ones in the result vector. Instead, one allows for a certain number of ‚Äúmismatches‚Äù ‚Äì this number of mismatches depends on both the number of ones in each column, and also the noise parameter, q. This noisy COMP algorithm requires no more than 4.36(\\\\sqrt{\\\\delta} + \\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\delta})^2 (1 - 2q)^{-2}d \\\\log_2{n} tests to achieve an error probability at most n^{-\\\\delta}.  Definite defectives (DD)  The definite defectives method (DD) is an extension of the COMP algorithm that attempts to remove any false positives. Performance guarantees for DD have been shown to strictly exceed those of COMP. The decoding step uses a useful property of the COMP algorithm: that every item that COMP declares non- defective is certainly non-defective (that is, there are no false negatives). It proceeds as follows. #First the COMP algorithm is run, and any non- defectives that it detects are removed. All remaining items are now \\"possibly defective\\". #Next the algorithm looks at all the positive tests. If an item appears as the only \\"possible defective\\" in a test, then it must be defective, so the algorithm declares it to be defective. #All other items are assumed to be non-defective. The justification for this last step comes from the assumption that the number of defectives is much smaller than the total number of items. Note that steps 1 and 2 never make a mistake, so the algorithm can only make a mistake if it declares a defective item to be non-defective. Thus the DD algorithm can only create false negatives.  Sequential COMP (SCOMP)  SCOMP (Sequential COMP) is an algorithm that makes use of the fact that DD makes no mistakes until the last step, where it is assumed that the remaining items are non-defective. Let the set of declared defectives be K. A positive test is called explained by K if it contains at least one item in K. The key observation with SCOMP is that the set of defectives found by DD may not explain every positive test, and that every unexplained test must contain a hidden defective. The algorithm proceeds as follows. # Carry out steps 1 and 2 of the DD algorithm to obtain K, an initial estimate for the set of defectives. # If K explains every positive test, terminate the algorithm: K is the final estimate for the set of defectives. # If there are any unexplained tests, find the \\"possible defective\\" that appears in the largest number of unexplained tests, and declare it to be defective (that is, add it to the set K). Go to step 2. In simulations, SCOMP has been shown to perform close to optimally.  Example applications  The generality of the theory of group testing lends it to many diverse applications, including clone screening, locating electrical shorts; high speed computer networks; medical examination, quantity searching, statistics; machine learning, DNA sequencing; cryptography; and data forensics. This section provides a brief overview of a small selection of these applications.  Multiaccess channels  An illustration of a multiaccess channel showing a successful message and a message collision. A multiaccess channel is a communication channel that connects many users at once. Every user can listen and transmit on the channel, but if more than one user transmits at the same time, the signals collide, and are reduced to unintelligible noise. Multiaccess channels are important for various real-world applications, notably wireless computer networks and phone networks.Chlebus, B. S. (2001). \\"Randomized communication in radio networks\\". In: Pardalos, P. M.; Rajasekaran, S.; Reif, J.; Rolim, J. D. P. (Eds.), Handbook of Randomized Computing, Vol. I, p.401‚Äì456. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht. A prominent problem with multiaccess channels is how to assign transmission times to the users so that their messages do not collide. A simple method is to give each user their own time slot in which to transmit, requiring n slots. (This is called time division multiplexing, or TDM.) However, this is very inefficient, since it will assign transmission slots to users that may not have a message, and it is usually assumed that only a few users will want to transmit at any given time ‚Äì otherwise a multiaccess channel is not practical in the first place. In the context of group testing, this problem is usually tackled by dividing time into 'epochs' in the following way. A user is called 'active' if they have a message at the start of an epoch. (If a message is generated during an epoch, the user only becomes active at the start of the next one.) An epoch ends when every active user has successfully transmitted their message. The problem is then to find all the active users in a given epoch, and schedule a time for them to transmit (if they have not already done so successfully). Here, a test on a set of users corresponds to those users attempting a transmission. The results of the test are the number of users that attempted to transmit, 0, 1, and 2^+, corresponding respectively to no active users, exactly one active user (message successful) or more than one active user (message collision). Therefore, using an adaptive group testing algorithm with outcomes \\\\\\\\{ 0, 1, 2^+\\\\\\\\}, it can be determined which users wish to transmit in the epoch. Then, any user that has not yet made a successful transmission can now be assigned a slot to transmit, without wastefully assigning times to inactive users.  Machine learning and compressed sensing  Machine learning is a field of computer science that has many software applications such as DNA classification, fraud detection and targeted advertising. One of the main subfields of machine learning is the 'learning by examples' problem, where the task is to approximate some unknown function when given its value at a number of specific points. As outlined in this section, this function learning problem can be tackled with a group-testing approach. In a simple version of the problem, there is some unknown function, f: \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^N \\\\to \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\} where f(\\\\textbf{x}) = \\\\textbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\textbf{x}, and \\\\textbf{a} \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^N (using logical arithmetic: addition is logical OR and multiplication is logical AND). Here \\\\textbf{a} is 'd sparse', which means that at most d \\\\ll N of its entries are 1. The aim is to construct an approximation to f using t point evaluations, where t is as small as possible. (Exactly recovering f corresponds to zero-error algorithms, whereas f is approximated by algorithms that have a non-zero probability of error.) In this problem, recovering f is equivalent to finding \\\\textbf{a}. Moreover, f(\\\\textbf{p}) = 1 if and only if there is some index, n, where \\\\textbf{a}_n = \\\\textbf{p}_n = 1. Thus this problem is analogous to a group-testing problem with d defectives and n total items. The entries of \\\\textbf{a} are the items, which are defective if they are 1, \\\\textbf{p} specifies a test, and a test is positive if and only if f(\\\\textbf{p}) = 1. In reality, one will often be interested in functions that are more complicated, such as f: \\\\mathbb{C}^N \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}, again where f(\\\\textbf{x}) = \\\\textbf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\textbf{x}. Compressed sensing, which is closely related to group testing, can be used to solve this problem. In compressed sensing, the goal is to reconstruct a signal, \\\\textbf{v} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}^N, by taking a number of measurements. These measurements are modelled as taking the dot product of \\\\textbf{v} with a chosen vector. The aim is to use a small number of measurements, though this is typically not possible unless something is assumed about the signal. One such assumption (which is commonGilbert, A. C.; Iwen, M. A.; Strauss, M. J. (October 2008). \\"Group testing and sparse signal recovery\\". 42nd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers: 1059‚Äì1063. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.) is that only a small number of entries of \\\\textbf{v} are significant, meaning that they have a large magnitude. Since the measurements are dot products of \\\\textbf{v}, the equation M\\\\textbf{v} = \\\\textbf{q} holds, where M is a t \\\\times N matrix that describes the set of measurements that have been chosen and \\\\mathbf{q} is the set of measurement results. This construction shows that compressed sensing is a kind of 'continuous' group testing. The primary difficulty in compressed sensing is identifying which entries are significant. Once that is done, there are a variety of methods to estimate the actual values of the entries. This task of identification can be approached with a simple application of group testing. Here a group test produces a complex number: the sum of the entries that are tested. The outcome of a test is called positive if it produces a complex number with a large magnitude, which, given the assumption that the significant entries are sparse, indicates that at least one significant entry is contained in the test. There are explicit deterministic constructions for this type of combinatorial search algorithm, requiring d2^{(\\\\log_2 \\\\log_2 N)^{O(1)}} measurements. However, as with group-testing, these are sub- optimal, and random constructions (such as COMP) can often recover f sub- linearly in N.  Multiplex assay design for COVID19 testing  During a pandemic such as the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, virus detection assays are sometimes run using nonadaptive group testing designs. One example was provided by the Origami Assays project which released open source group testing designs to run on a laboratory standard 96 well plate. Origami Assay paper template for group testing design In a laboratory setting, one challenge of group testing is the construction of the mixtures can be time-consuming and difficult to do accurately by hand. Origami assays provided a workaround for this construction problem by providing paper templates to guide the technician on how to allocate patient samples across the test wells. Using the largest group testing designs (XL3) it was possible to test 1120 patient samples in 94 assay wells. If the true positive rate was low enough, then no additional testing was required. See also: List of countries implementing pool testing strategy against COVID-19.  Data forensics  Data forensics is a field dedicated to finding methods for compiling digital evidence of a crime. Such crimes typically involve an adversary modifying the data, documents or databases of a victim, with examples including the altering of tax records, a virus hiding its presence, or an identity thief modifying personal data. A common tool in data forensics is the one-way cryptographic hash. This is a function that takes the data, and through a difficult-to-reverse procedure, produces a unique number called a hash. Hashes, which are often much shorter than the data, allow us to check if the data has been changed without having to wastefully store complete copies of the information: the hash for the current data can be compared with a past hash to determine if any changes have occurred. An unfortunate property of this method is that, although it is easy to tell if the data has been modified, there is no way of determining how: that is, it is impossible to recover which part of the data has changed. One way to get around this limitation is to store more hashes ‚Äì now of subsets of the data structure ‚Äì to narrow down where the attack has occurred. However, to find the exact location of the attack with a naive approach, a hash would need to be stored for every datum in the structure, which would defeat the point of the hashes in the first place. (One may as well store a regular copy of the data.) Group testing can be used to dramatically reduce the number of hashes that need to be stored. A test becomes a comparison between the stored and current hashes, which is positive when there is a mismatch. This indicates that at least one edited datum (which is taken as defectiveness in this model) is contained in the group that generated the current hash. In fact, the amount of hashes needed is so low that they, along with the testing matrix they refer to, can even be stored within the organisational structure of the data itself. This means that as far as memory is concerned the test can be performed 'for free'. (This is true with the exception of a master-key/password that is used to secretly determine the hashing function.)
