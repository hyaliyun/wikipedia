Construction and commissioning Venom, the second Royal Navy ship of the name, was ordered in January 1918 as part of the 10th Order of the 1918-19 Naval Programme. She was laid down on 31 May 1918 by John Brown & Company at Clydebank, Scotland, and launched on 21 December 1918.Naval History: Ships of the Royal Navy, 1914-1919 - in alphabetical order (Part 2 of 2) She was renamed Venomous, the first Royal Navy ship of the name, on 24 April 1919 to avoid confusion with the Royal Navys torpedo school, . She was completed on 24 August 1919 and commissioned into service the same day. Her original pennant number, G98, assigned in June 1919, was changed to D75 during the interwar period. Service history Interwar years Venomous was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla in the Atlantic Fleet. During the winter of 1919‚Äì1920, she made several cruises in the Baltic Sea, participating in the British campaign against Bolshevik and German forces in Latvia, Estonia, and Finland. In 1920, she conducted patrols to prevent smugglers from bringing guns into Ireland, and her crew took part in preventing a coal strike from paralysing the British economy.Naval Historical Foundation Book Review ‚Äì A Hard Fought Ship, The Story of HMS Venomous In October 1923, Venomous was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, in which she operated until 1929 with Valletta, Malta, as her home port. Early in her Mediterranean tour, she patrolled in support of British interests during fighting between Greece and Turkey. On 2 November 1924, she was steaming in the Grand Harbour upon returning to Valletta from a cruise in the Western Mediterranean Sea when she accidentally rammed and sank a motorboat from the light cruiser ; all four people aboard the motorboat were saved by a boat from the destroyer .holywellhousepublishing.co.uk A HARD FOUGHT SHIP: The story of HMS Venomous: What's NewA Hard Fought Ship, The Story of HMS Venomous: The Grand Harbour, Valletta, 2 November 1924 Venomous was decommissioned in 1929 and transferred to the Reserve Fleet at Rosyth, Scotland. In October 1938, she briefly was recommissioned during a crisis with Nazi Germany, but she soon was placed back in reserve when the war scare abated. As tensions with Germany grew yet again in the summer of 1939, Venomous was recommissioned again with Donald Macintyre as her commanding officer; he would remain in command of her until January 1940 and go on to become one of the most famous convoy escort commanders of World War II. World War II =September 1939 ‚Äì May 1940= The United Kingdom entered World War II in September 1939. That month, Venomous was assigned to the 16th Destroyer Flotilla at Portsmouth, England, to escort troop convoys carrying the British Expeditionary Force from the United Kingdom to France. Her first such convoy was on 7 September 1939, which she and the destroyer escorted. On 12 September 1939 the two destroyers escorted Convoy MB 2 from England to Cherbourg, France, and on 15 September they escorted Convoy DB 2. In October 1939, Venomous was reassigned to duty escorting convoys of merchant ships in the Southwestern Approaches and English Channel which she continued until May 1940. =The Battle of France, May‚ÄìJune 1940= Venomous had just left Cherbourg, France, on 10 May 1940 when she received a signal that Germany had invaded the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France. She was assigned to operations in support of Allied forces, and spent the next week operating in the North Sea off the Dutch coast. She and the destroyer transported a party of Royal Marines to the Hook of Holland in the Netherlands on 12 May 1940. On 15 May she embarked refugees at Amsterdam in the Netherlands and picked up 46 or 48 (sources differ) refugees aboard the Dutch lifeboat Zeemanshoop in the North Sea and took them to Dover, England. Her operations focused on the evacuation of Allied personnel and refugees as the German offensive inflicted defeat after defeat on Allied forces. At Calais, France ‚Äì where she fired her antiaircraft guns at German aircraft bombing the harbour ‚Äì she picked up some 200 British subjects on 21 May 1940, also loading submarine detection equipment and manufacturing equipment from a rayon factory, and transported the refugees and cargo to England. On 22 May she escorted the Isle of Man ferry Mona Queen as she transported British Army troops of the Irish Guards to Boulogne, returning to England with 212 refugees aboard.A Hard Fought Ship, The Story of HMS Venomous: The evacuation of British citizens from Calais by the V & Ws The contingent of refugees included the Austrian- born philosopher, philosopher of science, sociologist, and political economist Otto Neurath and the German designer, social scientist, and author Marie Reidemeister, who married Neurath in 1941.A Hard Fought Ship, The Story of HMS Venomous: Children escape besieged Boulogne on HMS Venomous On 23 May 1940, Venomous embarked a demolition party of Royal Engineers at Dover and took them to Calais to destroy port facilities there, but the party was unable to disembark due to heavy fighting in the area and Venomous returned to Dover. Later in the day, she joined the destroyers , , , and off Boulogne to evacuate troops of the British Armys Irish Guards and Welsh Guards, who had become trapped there by advancing German troops and tanks of the 2nd Panzer Division during the Battle of Boulogne. Sixty German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers had recently attacked the harbour and French destroyers bombarding offshore, so the British ships awaited the arrival of Royal Air Force fighter cover before attempting to enter the harbour. After British aircraft arrived on the scene at 19:20 hours, Whitshed and Vimiera entered the harbour first, taking aboard as many British soldiers as possible ‚Äì over 550 men each ‚Äì under fire from German forces before steaming back out of the harbour at 20:25 hours, with Whitshed completely destroying two German tanks at point-blank range with her 4.7-inch (120-mm) guns as she departed. Sebag-Montefiore, Hugh, Dunkirk: Fight To the Last Man, Harvard University Press, 2006, pp. 208‚Äì209, 593‚Äì594 Venomous and Wild Swan entered the harbour next, at 20:35 hours, followed by Venetia at 20:40 hours. The Germans opened fire on Venetia with heavier guns as she entered the harbour, apparently in an attempt to sink her in the harbour entrance to trap Venomous and Wild Swan and bring the evacuation operation to an end. A German shell, probably from a tank, hit Venetia, starting a fire aft and prompting her crew to jettison her torpedoes and burning Carley floats. Another shell hit her \\"B\\" gun turret, blowing overboard and killing some of the men there, and German gunfire also inflicted casualties among the men on her bridge, causing her to go out of control and briefly run aground. Gunners aboard Venomous, seeing that Venetia was in danger of being sunk, realized that the Germans had captured Fort de la Cr√®che on a hill overlooking the entrance and were using its coastal artillery to fire on Venetia. Venomous opened fire on the fort; her first salvo went over it, but her second salvo silenced the forts guns by blowing off one side of the fort and much of the hillside it was on, causing artillery pieces to tumble down the hill. Venomous also detected a German light field gun in the garden of a house and fired on it; her first salvo flattened all of the trees in the garden, set the house on fire, and caused German troops in the vicinity to flee. All heavy German guns fell silent after this and, given a reprieve, Venetia, which had been hit seven times and been unable to embark any troops, was quickly refloated and backed out of the harbour at full speed at 20:48 hours. Venomous‚Äîusing her engines to manoeuvre because her steering gear had jammed‚Äîand Wild Swan followed Venetia out of the harbour, also in reverse, carrying about 400 evacuees each, along the way knocking out a German tank and shooting up two German troop columns. Venomous and Wild Swan then escorted the damaged Venetia to Dover. On 26 May 1940, Venomous began operations in support of Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of Allied personnel from the beachhead around Dunkirk, France. She made two trips on 31 May 1940, carrying 670 troops from De Panne, Belgium, and Bray-Dunes, France, on the first one and 408 troops from the pier at Dunkirk on the second. She transported 630 troops on 2 June 1940, 957 more on 3 June, and 463 troops on her final voyage from Dunkirk on 4 June. In all, she evacuated 3,128 or 4,410 troops (sources differ) in her five evacuation voyages to the Dunkirk beachhead. =June‚ÄìDecember 1940= Venomous was released from operations related to the Battle of France on 7 June 1940 and reassigned to convoy defence and anti-invasion patrols in the North Sea, which she conducted through August 1940. She and the destroyer were escorting Convoy FN 19 off Great Yarmouth on 11 June 1940 when they came under attack by six German aircraft, but she used skilful manoeuvring to avoid damage. In September 1940, she and Wild Swan patrolled off Boulogne, and on the night of 13‚Äì14 September 1940 they and the destroyer bombarded German positions there. In October 1940, Venomous was transferred to the Western Approaches for convoy escort duty. On 13 November 1940, she began a voyage to Gibraltar as part of the screen of the aircraft carrier as she deployed to the Mediterranean to transport aircraft to Malta in Operation White. On 18 December 1940, Venomous arrived at Derry (also called Londonderry), Northern Ireland, to become part of the 1st Escort Group. She was operating as part of the escort for Convoy HX 96 when she struck a mine in Liverpool Bay on 31 December 1940 and suffered serious damage, forcing to her to undergo repairs that were not complete until February 1941. =1941= Her repairs complete, Venomous was back in service with the 1st Escort Group at Londonderry in February 1941 to continue convoy escort work in the Western Approaches. In April 1941 she collided with the submarine and required two weeks of repairs before returning to service in May 1941. She was escorting Convoy OB 343 off Iceland in July 1941 when she was forced to detach and return to Londonderry for repairs to her propulsion machinery, which lasted until September 1941. She returned to her escort group and was part of the escort of Convoy ONS 21 in October 1941. In November 1941 she was escorting Convoy OS 35 when she collided with the destroyer leader . She was withdrawn from service and in December 1941 work began at Greenock, Scotland, both to repair her and convert her into a long-range escort, as well as to install Type 271 surface warning radar. =1942= HMS Venomous during World War II While under repair, Venomous was \\"adopted\\" by the civil community of Loughborough in Leicestershire, England, in a Warship Week campaign than ran from 5 to 14 February 1942.holywellhousepublishing.co.uk A Hard Fought Ship - The Story of HMS Venomous: TS Venomous, the Sea Cadet Corps unit at Loughborough When her repairs, conversion, and radar installation were complete, she reported to the Home Fleet on 20 April 1942 for duty escorting Arctic convoys to the Soviet Union. From 28 April to 5 May 1942, she escorted Convoy PQ 15 bound for the Soviet Union, and from 21 to 27 May 1942 she escorted Convoy QP 12 during its voyage from the Soviet Union to the United Kingdom. In June 1942, Venomous returned to convoy duty in the North Atlantic. She detached from this duty in July 1942 to escort the aircraft carrier to the Mediterranean to deliver aircraft to Malta in Operation Bellows. She remained with Furious as she began her voyage through the Western Mediterranean toward Malta on 11 August 1942. When Operation Bellows was complete, Venomous steamed to Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands to rejoin the Home Fleet for another period of Arctic convoy duty. In August, she was selected to participate in the escort of Convoy PQ 18 to the Soviet Union, but a boiler problem arose in September 1942 that prevented her from joining the convoy. Instead, she deployed on 10 September 1942 with the destroyers , , and to establish a forward fuelling base for destroyers escorting PQ 18 and Convoy QP 14, which was returning from the Soviet Union to the United Kingdom. Venomous, with survivors of Hecla at Casablanca, Morocco, 17 November 1942 Venomous detached from the Home Fleet in October 1942 to escort military convoys to Gibraltar on their way to the Allied amphibious landings in French North Africa in Operation Torch, scheduled for early November 1942. On 12 November 1942 she and the destroyer were escorting the repair ship and the destroyer depot ship when she detected the German submarine U-515 with her Type 271 surface warning radar in the North Atlantic 180 nautical miles (333 km) west of Gibraltar. While she was hunting for U-515, the submarine fired four torpedoes at 00:15 hours at Hecla, which sighted and avoided two of them but was hit by the other two. While Venomous and Marne continued to hunt for U-515, the submarine torpedoed Hecla three more times, at 01:28, 01:49, and 02:06 hours, after which Hecla quickly sank at with the loss of 279 lives. Venomous and Marne began to rescue Heclas survivors, but Marne had pulled only 64 out of the water when U-515 torpedoed her at 02:11 hours, blowing her stern off. Venomous aborted her rescue operation to counterattack, then, with 493 Hecla survivors aboard, took Marne in tow. She then made another radar contact on U-515 and dropped her tow to attack the submarine, which she finally drove off with a series of depth charge attacks. Relieved of escorting Marne by the corvette , Venomous proceeded to Casablanca in French Morocco with 568 Hecla survivors aboard. In December 1942, Venomous was assigned to duty escorting convoys between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom. =1943= Venomous was assigned to convoy escort duties in the Western Mediterranean in February 1943. In March 1943 she was selected to participate in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily planned for July 1943, and in April 1943 she steamed to the River Clyde in Scotland to begin operations related to the build-up for Husky. On 16 April 1943, she departed the Clyde along with the escort destroyer , the frigates and , the sloops and , and the cutters and as the local escort for the military convoy WS 29 during its passage from the Clyde through the Western Approaches, detaching on 20 April to return to the Clyde. Venomous continued to escort United Kingdom-to-Gibraltar Husky-related military convoys until June 1943, when she was reassigned to escort convoys in the Western Mediterranean as the date of the invasion approached. On 9 July 1943, she departed Alexandria, Egypt, as part of the escort for the military convoy MFW 37 and, upon the convoys arrival off Syracuse, Sicily, on 13 July, three days after the initial landings, deployed to support forces ashore with gunfire and to defend the beachhead against Axis submarines and motor torpedo boats. Released from Husky in August 1943, Venomous defended convoys in the Mediterranean until October 1943, when she returned to the United Kingdom for a refit. She was in the dockyard at Falmouth, England, for the remainder of the year. =1944‚Äì1945= Venomous remained out of service throughout the first half of 1944 and was decommissioned to undergo conversion into a target ship for use in training aircrews in anti-shipping attacks, with additional duty as a tender. In August 1944, she was recommissioned for service as a target ship, continuing in this role until the surrender of Germany in early May 1945. After Germanys surrender, she supported Allied forces in reoccupation operations in Europe, and on 14 May 1945 joined the destroyer leader in escorting minesweepers as they conducted minesweeping operations at Kristiansund South in Norway prior to the arrival of other Allied ships there. Decommissioning and disposal After the surrender of Germany in early May 1945, Venomous was decommissioned and placed in reserve; by October 1945, she no longer appeared on the Royal Navys active list. Later placed on the disposal list, she was sold on 4 March 1947 for scrapping by Metal Industries at Charlestown, Fife. She arrived at the shipbreakers yard in July or August 1947 (sources differ) and was scrapped during 1948. Legacy The Sea Cadet Corps training unit at Loughborough was commissioned in 1948 as TS Venomous in tribute to the ship. The unit was presented with the ships commissioning pennant and took custody of the ships crest and the plaque Loughborough had presented to HMS Venomous in 1942 upon adopting her during the 5‚Äì14 February 1942 Warship Week campaign. On 5 February 2012, the 70th anniversary of the beginning of that campaign, TS Venomous was completely destroyed by fire. The crest and plaque were also destroyed.

In some instances, they are also responsible for moveable heritage, interpretation centres and museums. History Prior to the coming into effect of South Africa's National Heritage Resources Act on National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999 1 April 2000, heritage matters were managed by a single agency at national level, the National Monuments Council. This agency was best known for its protection of several thousand 'national monuments', responsibility for which the new legislation devolved to provincial level and renamed 'provincial heritage sites', the term used in most provinces to describe them. Establishment 'Provincial heritage resources authority' or 'PHRA' is the term used by the National Heritage Resources Act to describe an authority responsible for management of what the Act describes as the 'national estate' in a province. Sections 3 and 23, National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999 The Act establishes three grades of heritage resource which broadly indicate significance at national, provincial and local level. The national heritage resources authority, SAHRA is responsible for Grade I heritage resources whilst PHRAs are responsible for Grade II heritage resources and in most instances also those at Grade III level since few municipalities have been assessed as competent to manage the national estate and given delegations to do so. Section 7, National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999 The three tier system of heritage management stems from provisions of South Africa's 1996 Constitution which determines that heritage conservation is a shared competency of the national and provincial spheres of government. Schedule 4, Part A, Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act. 108 of 1996 Local government can hence only take on such responsibility if it does so voluntarily. Each of the nine provinces has established a PHRA, with most of them electing to do so under provisions of the National Heritage Resources Act. Only the KwaZulu-Natal and Northern Cape PHRA's are set up in terms of legislation at provincial level. KwaZulu-Natal has the oldest PHRA predating the passing of the National Heritage Resources Act. The KwaZulu-Natal Heritage Act, 1997 (Act No. 10 of 1997) In the Northern Cape the PHRA was initially set up in terms of the National Heritage Resources Act, but in 2014 provincial legislation was passed.Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority Act, Act No 9 of 2013, Province of the Northern Cape Provincial Gazette Extraordinary, No 1784, 5 March 2014 The government of the Eastern Cape Province initially set up a PHRA under provincial legislation, but in 2012 reestablished it in terms of the national Act. Eastern Cape Heritage Resources Act (Act No. 9 of 2003) & Eastern Cape General Laws Amendment Act (Act No. 2 of 2012) All PHRAs are public entities in terms of South Africa's Public Finance Management Act Section 1, Public Finance Management Act, Act 1 of 1999, (as amended) List of provincial heritage resources authorities * Eastern Cape Province: Eastern Cape Provincial Heritage Resources Authority * Free State Province: Heritage Free State * Gauteng Province: Provincial Heritage Resources Authority Gauteng * KwaZulu-Natal Province: Amafa aKwaZulu-Natali * Limpopo Province: Limpopo Heritage Resources Authority * Mpumalanga Province: Mpumalanga Provincial Heritage Resources Authority * North West Province: North West Provincial Heritage Resources Authority * Northern Cape Province: Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority * Western Cape Province: Heritage Western Cape Powers Protections PHRAs are able to exercise the bulk of the powers to protect heritage resources set out in Chapter II of the National Heritage Resources Act. These are divided into two types, 'Formal Protections' which require a specific action by a heritage resources authority to designate, usually by notice in a government gazette, and 'General Protections' which apply without the need for specific action and which usually apply by virtue of the age of the heritage resources concerned.

The phenomenon occurs when the anticoagulant used while testing the blood sample causes clumping of platelets which mimics a low platelet count. Causes It is a relatively uncommon phenomenon caused by in vitro agglutination of platelets. As a result of platelet clumping, platelet counts reported by automated counters may be much lower than the actual count in the blood because these devices cannot differentiate platelet clumps from individual cells. The incidence of pseudothrombocytopenia reported in different studies ranges from 0.09 to 0.21 percent, which accounts for 15 to 30 percent of all cases of isolated thrombocytopenia. Pseudothrombocytopenia has been reported in association with the use of EDTA as an anticoagulant, with platelet cold agglutinins, and with multiple myeloma.  Failsafes and avoiding false-positives  A pseudothrombocytopenia false-positive result may occur when automated platelet counting devices are used. As a means of double checking the results, the patient's blood sample is often examined under a microscope. If the clumping is visible and the number of platelets appears normal, pseudothrombocytopenia may be concluded. A second sample run with a different anticoagulant such as citrate (blue top tube) to confirm the finding of pseudothrombocytopenia may be requested if there are doubts or concerns.

He has previously served as a head coach of the women's basketball team at St. Joseph's, Vanderbilt and Ohio State. He has been elected to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame as a member of the class of 2013. On February 1, 2018, Foster notched his 900th career win as a head coach, becoming the eighth fastest to reach that mark and tying for seventh in all-time career wins.Mocs Give Foster 900th Win; Down WCU 58-41 He announced his retirement in May 2018, after 40 years on the bench. Early years Foster was born October 16, 1948 in Abington, Pennsylvania. He grew up in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, and attended Cardinal Dougherty High School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He joined the Army in 1966, and served until 1969, with half of that time spent in Vietnam. While he was serving, his brother, John was drafted. Although Jim's tour was scheduled to end, he agreed to serve an additional tour in Vietnam so his brother would not have to serve in a war zone. After completing his tours, Foster attended Temple University, graduating in 1980. Coaching career Foster began his coaching career at Bishop McDevitt High School in Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania, where he served as the boys basketball assistant coach and the girls basketball head coach. Saint Joseph's University Foster began his college head coaching career as the head coach at St. Joseph's in 1978. He remained as head coach for 13 seasons, compiling a record of 248‚Äì126. In 1985, the Hawks won seven of their eight Atlantic Ten games to win the conference title. They won 25 games during the season to earn their first ever bid to an NCAA tournament. This bid would be the first of six consecutive bids to the NCAA Tournament. Vanderbilt Foster accepted a position as head coach of the women's basketball team at Vanderbilt in 1991. He remained there for eleven seasons, compiling a record of 256‚Äì99. While at Vanderbilt, Foster served a one-year term as President of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association. Ohio State Foster became the head coach of the women's basketball team at Ohio State in 2002. He served in that position for eleven years, with a record of 279‚Äì82. While at Ohio State, the Big Ten selected Foster as the women's basketball coach of the year three consecutive years, 2005‚Äì2007 and again in 2009. Foster was fired by Ohio State at the end of the 2012‚Äì2013 season after his team did not make the NCAA tournament. Kevin McGuff was hired as his replacement. Ohio State played Notre Dame in the first-ever women's basketball game played on an aircraft carrier. The game was played on the , now a National Historic Landmark in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. The Yorktown served in Vietnam while Foster was serving in Vietnam. Notre Dame won the game, 57‚Äì51. Chattanooga On May 9, 2013, Chattanooga announced the hiring of Foster to become the new head coach of the women's basketball team. In April 2016, Chattanooga announced that Foster's contract had been extended through the 2021‚Äì22 season, although he decided to retire in May 2018. USA basketball Foster served as assistant coach or head coach of USA Basketball teams on nine occasions, and served (2013‚Äì16) as the chair of the Women's Junior National Team Committee. In 1987, he was the assistant coach of the gold medal-winning 1987 Olympic Festival women's basketball team. In 1989 he was the assistant coach of the USA representative at the World Junior Championships in Bilbao, Spain (now called U19). In 1990, he was an assistant coach under Theresa Grentz for the USA National team at the World Championships in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The team, behind the 22 point per game scoring of Teresa Edwards, won all eight contests, with only the win over Cuba decided by single digits. The USA team faced Yugoslavia in the gold medal game, and won 88‚Äì78. The same team returned to Seattle, Washington, for the 1990 Goodwill Games. The team hadn't lost a game in the last 36 games, but they struggled in the opening game against South Korea. They were trailing after more than eleven minutes played before going on a run to take a commanding lead. The next opponent was the USSR, who led at halftime, before the USA took over in the second half. The USA team then won two games easily, and faced the USSR again for the gold medal. This time, the USA took at ten point lead in the first half, opened the second half with a 16‚Äì1 run and held on to win 82‚Äì70. In 1991, Foster had his first USA experience as a head coach, with the Junior Select Team, coaching the team to a 5‚Äì1 record. In 1992, he returned to his role as an assistant under Grentz, when the USA National team went to the Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. The team only suffered one loss but it was a 79‚Äì73 loss in the medal round to the Unified team (the countries of the former Soviet Union). The team won the final game against Cuba to earn the bronze medal. Foster took over the head coaching duties of the USA Women's Junior World Championship Team in 1993. The Championship was held in Seoul, South Korea. The USA team lost to host South Korea, but then won three games to stay in contention for the medal round. At the end of preliminary play, the USA team, with a 4‚Äì1 record, was in a three-way tie for two medal round positions. The tie-breaking rule was based upon point differential, and the USA team was third behind South Korea and Russia. The USA team then lost a one-point game to France, and recovered to beat Japan in the final game. The team ended with an overall record of 5‚Äì2, but this was only good enough for seventh place. In 1997, Foster was named head coach of the USA representative to the World University Games, held in Marsala, Sicily, Italy. The USA team had not won gold in this biennial event since 1991. This year, the USA team would be dominant, with easy victories in all but one contest. After winning their first three contests by no fewer than 38 points, the USA team faced Russia. The game had five ties and 13 lead changes. Connecticut's Nykesha Sales led the scoring of the USA team with 17 points, hitting connective baskets in the second half to give the USA a lead it would not give up. The USA went on to win the game 78‚Äì70. The USA went on to win the two medal rounds games, with a 100‚Äì82 victory over Cuba to give the USA team the gold medal. In 2003, Foster was named head of the USA team competing at the FIBA World Championship For Young Women (also known as the U21 Women's World Championship) held in ≈†ibenik, Croatia. After winning their first two games, the USA team lost to Brazil 73‚Äì60. The USA team went on to win their next games, and qualified for the medal round. The semifinal game was against France, their opponent in the first game, That game had been close, with the USA winning by a score of 56‚Äì48. This game would also be close, with the USA winning 58‚Äì47 to advance to the gold medal game in a rematch against Brazil.

Early life Born about 1637, near Charing Cross, he was the son of Francis Vernon of London and brother of James Vernon. He was admitted in 1649 to Westminster School. He matriculated on 10 November 1654 at Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated B.A. on 28 January 1658, and M.A. on 17 July 1660. Vernon began to travel before he had taken his master's degree. During one of his voyages, he was taken by pirates and sold. After his release, he seems to have returned to Oxford. In 1668, he was chosen because of his experience to accompany Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle, ambassador-extraordinary to Sweden, and the king wrote to Christ Church requesting a leave of absence for him. In Paris Vernon was next appointed to go with Ralph Montagu to Paris as secretary to the embassy. His letters fell below the required standard, but he remained there till the end of 1671. He was, in fact, considered frivolous for filling correspondence with court and city gossip. He reported, for example, the first performances of plays by Jean Racine and Pierre Corneille in 1670 (the rival B√©r√©nice and Tite et B√©r√©nice).

Published by: Presses Universitaires de France. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40522304 During this time, Vernon became a point of contact between the scholars of France and England. In 1670, Christiaan Huygens, seriously ill, chose Vernon to carry out a donation of his papers to the Royal Society in London, should he die.A. E. Bell, Christian Huygens (1950), p. 65; archive.org. Jean-Baptiste Colbert controlled the French Academy of Sciences closely; in particular, the circulation of publications of its academicians. Vernon copied the M√©sure de la terre of Jean Picard for the Royal Society, which therefore saw it in 1671, while Colbert communicated it officially in 1676.E. G. R.

Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1787911 Among Vernon's other correspondents was Edward Pococke, copies of whose son's Latin version of Ibn-al-Tifail he presented to the Sorbonne and to Christiaan Huyghens. Another correspondent was John Collins, for whom Vernon obtained books through Jean Berthet, including works by Ren√© Descartes and Blaise Pascal. He also sent James Gregory a copy of Fermat's Diophantus. Vernon's services were recognised by his election to the Royal Society on his return to England in 1672, his proposer being Henry Oldenburg. Final voyage and death Vernon's final journey was from Venice, through Dalmatia, Greece and the islands to Persia. This expedition led in particular to the rediscovery of the location of Delphi, which was, at that time, unknown in western Europe.Terence Spencer, Shakespeare's Isle of Delphos, The Modern Language Review Vol. 47, No. 2 (Apr. 1952), pp. 199‚Äì202, at p. 201, Published by: Modern Humanities Research Association. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3718805 Vernon set off with George Wheler, Jacob Spon and Sir Giles Eastcourt on 20 June 1675. They were on the galley of the bailo (Giovanni Morosini, appointed that year). At Corfu, they were taken for spies, a recurring problem. The party broke up at Zante.Bertold Spuler, Europ√§ische Diplomaten in Konstantinopel bis zum Frieden von Belgrad (1739), Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Geschichte Osteuropas Jahrg. 1, H. 2 (1936), pp. 229‚Äì262, at p. 244. Published by: Franz Steiner Verlag. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/41040394 All four, as well as Bernard Randolph, whom Vernon encountered later, left written records of these travels. An account of Athens, Ath√®nes Ancienne et nouvelle, had appeared that year, written by George Guillet, who called himself Guillet de St Georges. It claimed to be based on first-hand experience but was in fact collated from published sources. Spon had seen a recent account by the Jesuit Jacques Babin and wanted to compare Guillet's book with the facts on the ground.Martin Luther D'Ooge, The Acropolis of Athens (1909), pp. 318‚Äì9; archive.org. Vernon in fact anticipated Spon in checking Guillet's book. He landed in central Greece in August 1675, through Domvrena.Meritt, p. 213. He travelled to Athens, and set up to tour the Peloponnese on 2 September with Eastcourt as companion. Via Mistra and Kalamata, they turned north to Patras. At Naupaktos, Eastcourt fell ill, and he died at Vitrinitza. Via Salona, Delphi and Thebes, Vernon returned to Athens on 3 October.Meritt, p. 214. Arriving alone in Persia, in the spring of 1677, Vernon was in a quarrel over a penknife and was murdered. He was buried at Ispahan two days afterwards. News of his fate was transmitted by Robert Huntington in Aleppo. Works Vernon's Journal, which was begun at Spalatro and finished at Ispahan, was found among the papers of Robert Hooke. It contains notes and many inscriptions. A letter to Oldenburg, dated 10 January 1675, was printed in the Philosophical Transactions of 1676 as Observations made during Travels from Venice through Dalmatia ‚Ä¶ to Smyrna. It was translated into French by Jacob Spon, who incorporated it in his R√©ponses √† la Critique publi√©e par M. Guillet, 1679. It contained the first description of Athens by an English visitor. In particular Vernon reported on the Parthenon, some years before the damage caused by Francesco Morosini's bombardment. Combined with notes of Jacques Carrey, the observations of Vernon were used by William Bell Dinsmoor in his Parthenon reconstruction, in relation to the south frieze.Ian Jenkins, The South Frieze of the Parthenon: Problems in Arrangement, American Journal of Archaeology Vol. 99, No. 3 (Jul. 1995), pp. 445‚Äì456, at p. 449.

Schellenberg's publications and ideas are part of the foundation for archival theory and practice in the United States. In particular, Schellenberg is known for pioneering American archival ideas about appraisal. Early life Theodore Roosevelt Schellenberg was born on February 24, 1903 to Abraham Lawrence and Sarah Schroeder Schellenberg in Garden Township, Harvey County, Kansas. Prior to Theodore's birth, his parents had decided to emigrate to the United States in 1879 to avoid the introduction of Russification in their native country, Russia. There was a large immigration population of Mennonites in Kanas during this time, which allowed Abraham Schellenberg to continue working as a leader for the Mennonite Brethren.  Education  In his youth, T. R. Schellenberg attended McPherson Elementary School (1908‚Äì1912) and Hillsboro Middle School (1912‚Äì1915). He went on to attend Hillsboro High School (1916‚Äì1918), but he later finished his high school career at Tabor Academy (1919‚Äì1922). From there, Schellenberg briefly attended Tabor College (1924‚Äì1926) before transferring to the University of Kansas. Here, he graduated in 1928 with a Bachelor's degree in History and received a Master's degree in History in 1930. After receiving both his Bachelor's and Master's at the University of Kansas, he finished his education at the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a Ph.D in 1934.\\"T. R. Schellenberg Papers Career Upon completing his doctorate, Schellenberg secured a position with the Joint Committee on Materials for Research as Executive Secretary, part of the American Council of Learned Societies and the Social Science Research Council. In the following year, he was hired within the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) as a Deputy Examiner, part of a group of academics who were tasked with examining the records of executive agencies in Washington D.C.. In 1938, he was appointed chief of the Division of Agriculture Department Archives, which he eventually left in 1945. It was in this position that he published his first paper in 1939, European Archival Practices in Arranging Records, which laid the groundwork for his life's work. In it, he observed that European methods only applied to U.S. records management in a limited way. Americans were creating documents at an unprecedented rate, and European archival practices did not adequately respond to the changing needs of American records management. Experiencing this issue firsthand during his work at NARA, Schellenberg's theory of the archives came from the practical need to adapt European archival practices to working with the massive scale of the federal records climate. Schellenberg briefly left NARA for three years at the close of WWII in 1945, when he took a job as a Records Officer in the Office of Price Administration. His work there illustrated the many difficulties found in managing vast amounts of government records, which only increased his commitment to finding solutions. In 1948, he returned to NARA as Program Adviser to the Archivist and published his first major work in 1949 called Disposition of Federal Records: How to Develop an Effective Program for the Preservation and Disposal of Federal Records. Schellenberg was promoted to Director of Archival Management in 1950 and served in that capacity until 1962. One of his first projects was to craft a rigorous training program for NARA employees because there was an inadequate standardization in his division's policies and procedures. He also created guidelines for how positions would be categorized and ensured that job descriptions were consistent. Schellenberg continued to provide archival training throughout his tenure at NARA by planning a two-semester course at American University, organizing a series of symposiums for senior archivists, and traveling to records centers throughout the U.S. to provide three-day classes on archives management. Schellenberg also oversaw a massive reappraisal of documents to deaccession old records and enforced a methodology more selective in the appraisal of new records. He then went on to serve as the assistant archivist of the United States until he retired in 1963.  Influence   Schellenberg on appraisal  Schellenberg's major contribution to archival practice was emphasizing the centrality of appraisal in archival work and making selection a primary role of the archivist. To Schellenberg, a record has \\"primary value\\" to the creator as evidence of activities, but also has \\"secondary value\\" (i.e. evidential or informational value) to future users of the records outside of the originating agency, such as other agencies, historians, or private users. He argued the most efficient way to deal with the sheer volume of records that archives were dealing with at the time was to differentiate between a record's primary and secondary value and, thus, determine the relative value of the records based on the secondary value of the records. This differentiation was key for Schellenberg as he argued for a greater distinction between records and archives. In his definition, records only have current, primary value to their creators, but archives are records deemed to have significant secondary value by an archivist (i.e. meriting permanent preservation) outside of their original value to the record's creators. Consequently, records were under the purview of records managers, and only those records holding value for future users (particularly for future historical inquiry) would become a part of the archives. According to Schellenberg, a record's overall value can be appraised based on three distinct criteria: * Uniqueness: The information contained in the record cannot be found anywhere else and must not have been duplicated. This can determine how unique the record is. * Form: The extent to which the information is formatted as well as the form of records themselves should both be considered. The hardware the information is stored on or the hardware needed to read the information should also be taken into account. * Importance: When appraising records, the needs of the federal government should take precedence before the needs of historians and social scientists. Historical significance of the records should also be taken into account.Schellenberg, Theodore R. (1956). Modern Archives: Principles and Techniques. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. Modern Archives: Principles and Techniques In 1954, Schellenberg was given the opportunity to travel to Australia through the Fulbright Program to assist Australians in creating an archival system suited to their archival issues. He spent months helping address records management concerns through a lecture and seminar series that allowed him to travel throughout the continent and even to Tasmania and New Zealand. During this time, his lecture and seminar notes began to take the shape of a textbook on archival work and management practices. In 1956, he published this work as the acclaimed text Modern Archives: Principles and Techniques‚Äîthus creating the first exhaustive American approach to archival administration. The book explores emerging issues, concerns, and approaches to archival theory and practice that modern archivists encounter, thereby reflecting the desire for a closer and more efficient working relationship between records management and archival work and giving readers a broad overview of principles of public records management. In responding to modern archival problems, particularly distinctly American archival concerns, the book also juxtaposes American archival work and theory with those of foreign countries to clarify the fundamental nature and methods of archives, records management, and archival management. Schellenberg's textbook was largely well received in the archival field, both in America and internationally, and quickly became a central text for students in archival training programs. After the publication, historian and archivist Waldo Gifford Leland positively reviewed the text in the October 1956 issue of the American Archivist, stating: \\"This compact and well written book is, at least in the opinion of the reviewer, the most significant and useful statement yet produced on the administration of modern records and archives.\\" In the following year, Schellenberg won a meritorious service award to honor the contributions made to the archival profession through the textbook.

Universities require accreditation by the Cyprus Agency of Quality Assurance and Accreditation in Higher Education in order to issue degrees. Primary education Faneromeni Primary School In the 2017-2018 academic year, there were 334 primary schools with 56,700 students and 3,980 teachers.

The Human Resource Development Authority of Cyprus (HRDA) is the body in charge of managing training funds in Cyprus. The system relies on contributions paid by all employees, with the exception of the self-employed and government workers. By law the Human Resource Development Levy rate cannot exceed 1% of the emoluments paid to each employee. In practice, the levy rate is 0.5% of payroll, with a monthly cap of ‚Ç¨4,533 (Regulation 509/2012). The HRDA issues grants to employers for approved training as well as allowances to trainees and financial assistance for obtaining training equipment. The HRDA subsidizes 80% of the cost of training, rising to 100% for ‚Äòhigh-priority multi-company training programmes‚Äô.

It created a box-office record by becoming the highest grossing Bengali film ever at that point of time when it released in 2000. The movie was remake of 1990 Hindi Film Jamai Raja which itself was remake of 1989 Telugu Film Attaku Yamudu Ammayiki Mogudu.  Plot summary  Mrs. Binodini Roy, a renowned industrialist, wants to marry off her elder daughter Rupa to her business partner's son. Rupa is against the marriage and hence she escapes from her house with the help of her father. On the way to one of her uncle's house, a cabbie tries to rob her belongings. But she is saved by a handsome motor-mechanic named Somu. Somu takes her to her uncle's house where he turns out to be one of his acquaintances. Gradually, Rupa and Somu come close to each other. One day they have a heated argument; but it's precisely after this that they realize their love for each other. They make up and even get married secretly without informing Rupa's mother. Soon, on her father's request, Rupa returns home. Her mother refuses to acknowledge her marriage; instead she decides to marry her off to her former match. On the day of her marriage, just when Rupa had given up all hope; Somu makes a dramatic entry to take charge of his ‚Äòsasurbari‚Äô (in-laws‚Äô house). But is it only his love for Rupa that has brought him here; or does Somu have a secret of his own? Cast * Prosenjit Chatterjee as Somu * Rituparna Sengupta as Rupa * Ranjit Mallick as Rupa's Father * Anamika Saha as Rupa's Mother * Subhashish Mukherjee * Tota Roy Chowdhury  Box office  Sasurbari Zindabad created box-office history by becoming the first Bengali film to cross the 2 crore mark in West Bengal. Made on a large budget of 60‚Äì70 lakh, the film's final box-office collections reached a staggering 2.50 crore; thus fulfilling all criteria to be adjudged an ‚ÄòAll-Time Blockbuster‚Äô. In the process, it went past previous Prosenjit- Rituparna blockbusters like Sudhu Ekbar Bolo, Baba Keno Chakor and Moner Manush to become the highest grosser ever. It eventually completed a ‚ÄòGolden Jubilee‚Äô by running for a period exceeding 50 weeks in the Bengal districts. It held the highest grosser record for 2 1/2 years until another Haranath Chakraborty directorial, Sathi overtook its tally.  Satellite rights  The film's satellite rights were at first awarded to the Bengali GEC ETV Bangla. But in 2009, the rights were transferred to the leading Bengali GEC Star Jalsha. At present only two channels, Star Jalsha and Jalsha Movies have the right to officially broadcast the film worldwide.  Video rights  The official video rights of this film have been purchased by Eskay Video, the most reputed video company in West Bengal. As of May 2013, the MRP is 49.  Legacy  Sasurbari Zindabad introduced a number of new trends in Bengali cinema which were attributed as the main factors behind the film's smashing performance. The factors were: 1) Big Budget - Previously, the average budget for a Bengali film used to be around 10 to 15 lakhs. But this film changed the trend by investing nearly 70 lakhs. A substantial amount of this budget was spent on improved picture quality, technology, grandeur, sets, costumes, and shooting locales which increased the attractiveness of the film. Buoyed by the film's humongous success, producers became more confident and budgets of Bengali films gradually picked up. 2) CinemaScope - Barring a few exceptions, CinemaScope was non-existent in Tollywood. This film re-introduced CinemaScope which lends a brighter, colourful and more attractive visual appeal to the film. Soon, CinemaScope became a regular feature in Bengali films. 3) Bollywood Art Director - Kaushik Sarkar, art director of Shah Rukh Khan starrer Yes Boss was roped in to do the production designing of this film. High-quality colourful sets made it the most glamorous Bengali film at that time. As a result, the other film-makers were forced to abandon the degraded production quality prevalent then in Tollywood. 4) Designer Clothes - Fashion designers were approached to do the costumes of Prosenjit and Rituparna. Hence, both of them looked their best in this film and their scorching chemistry set the screens on fire. Down the decade, designer clothes are the norm in Tollywood now. 5) Liplock - Prosenjit and Rituparna did a full-blown liplock in this film which lasted for nearly 30 seconds. This was one of the first such instances of a couple kissing each other on the lips in the history of mainstream Bengali cinema. Before this, the only other film for which the incredibly popular pair of Prosenjit and Rituparna locked lips (in multiple sequences) was Rituparno Ghosh‚Äôs cult-classic Utsab, which had its festival premiere just 3 weeks back. In that film they had gone one step further and performed a bold sex scene as well. After Sasurbari Zindabad, both Rituparna and Prosenjit engaged in quite a few intimate sequences with other heroes and heroines; but they never locked lips with each other again.  Trivia  *The title of the film itself is missing from the entire opening credits of the film. *This remains the highest-grossing Bengali film of Rituparna Sengupta's entire career. Also, this was her last association with Shree Venkatesh Films, the biggest production house in Tollywood. Before this, she had collaborated with them in Mayar Badhon and Tumi Ele Tai; both of which were again opposite Prosenjit. She also never worked with Haranath Chakraborty again except for a song-sequence in Chhayamoy (2013). *The film has a lot of striking similarities with the Aamir Khan-Karishma Kapoor starrer Raja Hindustani (1996). In both the films, the heroine's father is a kind-hearted man while the mother is presented as a vamp. There the hero is a taxi-driver in a hill town; while here the hero is a motor-mechanic also residing in a hill town. There the hero beats up a bunch of baddies after they tease the heroine for wearing a short dress. They have a huge argument over this, but they repent and soon make up. The whole sequence is exactly replicated here as well. There the hero performs a dance after being drunk in a party thrown by his in-laws, which his wife totally disapproves of. A very similar sequence is shown here as well, with the only difference being that the hero here was feigning to be drunk. And of course, both the films famously featured a lengthy and intense lip-lock between the leads, which was extremely rare in their times.

The incident occurred within the disputed and overlapping exclusive economic zones of Taiwan and the Philippines. After the incident, Taiwan imposed sanctions and conducted a two-day \\"safety and rescue drill\\" with its Naval and Coast Guard forces near the waters where the incident occurred, on the grounds that the killing took place within its exclusive economic zone and the Philippine authority's action was in violation of international law. A Philippine official stated that the shooting was a reaction to the threat of being rammed. The incident came under separate investigations by Taiwanese and Philippine authorities; Taiwanese authorities presented evidence of more than 50 bullet holes found on the fishing boat, while Philippine authorities examined a video tape recording of the incident. The Philippines released the result of the National Bureau of Investigation's inquiry into the incident on 7 August 2013; the NBI recommended homicide charges against eight Philippine Coast Guard personnel involved in the shooting and recommended sanctions against four others for allegedly trying to alter evidence. A day after the release of the investigation report, a representative of the Philippine government traveled to Taiwan to officially apologize to the victim's family. Taiwan subsequently lifted the sanctions it imposed against the Philippines and issued a statement announcing that relations between the two countries have normalized. Background Taiwan, the Philippines and China contest control of fishing waters in the South China Sea. On May 7, Chinese media reported that a large number of Chinese fishing vessels were on their way to disputed waters for a 40-day fishing expedition. The announcement provoked an angry response by some politicians in the Philippines, where an election was scheduled for May 13. Walden Bello, a spokesman for the left Akbayan party in a coalition with the ruling Liberal Party, called the fishing flotilla \\"tantamount to an invasion\\" and warned that Chinese \\"naval warships and troops\\" might follow. Taiwanese fishing vessels were also in the region. Incident On 9 May 2013, the Taiwanese fishing boat Guang Da Xing No. 28 () was operating about 164 nautical miles southeast of Cape Eluanbi, Taiwan. The vessel was captained by Captain Hung Yu-chih (Ê¥™ËÇ≤Êô∫); other crew members on board included the captain's father, Hung Shih- cheng (Ê¥™Áü≥Êàê), the captain's brother-in-law, Hung Jie-shang and an Indonesian national. The Filipino Maritime Control Surveillance 3001 (MCS-3001), a 35-meter vessel jointly manned by the Philippine Coast Guard and Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources personnel, detected two fishing boats at 43 nautical miles east of Balintang Island, an area that is within the overlapped EEZs of both Taiwan and the Philippines. The Philippine Coast Guard opened fire on the fishing boat during a 50-minute chase that ended around 10:00am. Fifty-nine (59) bullet holes (45 of which were entry holes) were found on the vessel and the slugs were identified as coming from a semi-automatic rifle. The vessel suffered significant damage, including engine failure, while the main deck experienced severe and concentrated attack, based on the distribution of the bullet holes.  Location  The incident occurred in the overlapping exclusive economic zones between Taiwan and the Philippines. The site of the incident is 43 nautical miles east of Balintang Island according to the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and 170 nautical miles south of Taiwan according to Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, both well within the 200 nautical mile range prescribed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. An exception to the 200 nautical mile rule occurs when exclusive economic zones would overlap; that is, state coastal baselines are less than apart as it was in this case. When an overlap occurs, it is up to the states to delineate the actual maritime boundary.William R. Slomanson, 2006. Fundamental Perspectives on International Law, 5th edn. Belmont, CA: Thomson-Wadsworth, 294. Generally, any point within an overlapping area defaults to the nearest state.UN Convention on the Law of The Sea. Death of Hung Shih-cheng As the first response, the Coast Guard Administration of Taiwan dispatched the 2,000-ton ROCCGC Tainan (CG-126) to the rescue of the stricken vessel and escort it back to its home port. Two Taiwanese fishing vessels assisted in the effort to tow the Guang Da Xing No. 28 back to Taiwan under the escort of the CGA. The incident led to the death of Taiwanese national Hung Shih-cheng (Ê¥™Áü≥Êàê), who was 65. The President of the Philippines, Benigno Aquino III, sent his personal representative to make an unofficial apology for the death of the Taiwanese fisherman on 15 May 2013, dispatching the chairman of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office, Amadeo R. Perez, to Taipei, Taiwan as his personal representative. However, Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou rejected the apology since it called the shooting \\"unfortunate\\" and \\"unintentional\\", insisting that Manila offer a formal apology and just compensation. The Philippines publicly welcomed a joint investigation with Taiwanese investigators on the incident in the first place, but later denied that it had ever made such an offer and rejected the joint investigation when the Taiwanese investigators arrived in Manila. Justice Secretary Leila de Lima stated that she would allow Taiwan to conduct an investigation parallel to that being conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation. Claims and investigations Taiwan Bullet trajectories on Guang Da Xing No. 28 (Top view) as determined by Taiwanese forensic investigators Bullet trajectories on Guang Da Xing No. 28 (Rear view) as determined by Taiwanese forensic investigators The victim's son, Hung Yu-chih (Ê¥™ËÇ≤Êô∫), rebutted the Philippine Coast Guard's claim, stating that the 15-ton Guang Da Xing No. 28 had a much lower speed compared to the 90-ton PCG vessel. He said their immediate reaction was to flee when the fishing boat encountered the armed Filipino vessel and allegations that the fishing boat had tried to ram the PCG vessel was self-serving and baseless. The Ministry of Justice published an investigation report on May 15, indicating that 45 bullets hit the boat and that no signs of a collision were found on the boat, refuting the Philippine's claim that the Taiwanese boat had rammed the Filipino vessel. The report further states that there were total of 59 bullet holes with at least one under the waterline and four near the cabin where the crew was hiding, inferring that the PCG intended to kill the crew. According to the voyage data recorder, the shooting occurred at 19¬∞59'47.27\\"N and 122¬∞55'41.37\\"E, which is outside the Philippines' territorial waters, but within the shared EEZ. The report further stated that Hung Shih-cheng died of respiratory failure and hemorrhage caused by a single gunshot wound to the neck inflicted by a 7.62 mm caliber ammunition commonly used in weapons such as the M14 rifle, the M240 machine gun and the M60 machine gun. It gave his manner of death as homicide. Philippines On May 10, Philippine Coast Guard Commandant Rear Admiral Rodolfo Isorena stated that the Taiwanese fishing boat together with another vessel were halted by the crew of MCS-3001 for an on-board inspection. The smaller of the two Taiwanese fishing boats did not respond to the warning and tried to ram the Philippine Coast Guard vessel. The commanding officer of MCS-3001 then gave the order to open fire at Guang Ta Hsin-28 to disable its engine. Two unidentified vessels then arrived in the area, apparently to rescue the disabled Taiwanese vessel, prompting MCS-3001 to disengage and leave. On May 17, investigators from the National Bureau of Investigation said that there are signs that the Philippine Coast Guard may have violated their so-called rules of engagement. The National Bureau of Investigation disclosed the results of their investigation on 7 August 2013, recommending the filing of homicide charges against the Philippine Coast Guard personnel involved in the shooting. The NBI stated that eight crewmen were found to have fired at the Taiwanese vessel. The investigation report also stated that the shooting occurred within Philippine territory in the waterway off the Batanes Islands. In addition, the NBI also recommended that charges of obstruction of justice be filed against four Philippine Coast Guard personnel for tampering with evidence related to the shooting incident. Reaction Public =In Taiwan= A protest by 200 Taiwanese outside the Manila Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei was held condemning the Philippine government and sympathizing with the dead fisherman. They also burned Philippine flags as part of the protests. The Republic of China (Taiwan) President Ma Ying-jeou urged the Taiwanese people not to vent their anger on Filipinos working in Taiwan and stated that the Philippine government should be held responsible. He insisted that like their Taiwanese fishermen, the Filipino migrant workers are making a living in Taiwan. Ma also suggested that a fishery agreement will help solve its maritime dispute with the Philippines. Rights groups in Taiwan also echoed the President's call to the Taiwanese people to refrain from targeting Filipinos in Taiwan. TransAsia Sisterhood Taiwan executive secretary Ly Vuoch, a Cambodian immigrant in Taiwan also insisted that not only Filipinos feel threatened when walking in the streets following the incident, but also other immigrants from Southeast Asia. Chen Hsiu-lien, policy researcher from the Taiwan International Workers‚Äô Association, urged the Taiwanese public not to vent their anger towards the Philippine government on Filipino migrant workers. Chen also claimed that President Ma is encouraging people to vent their anger on Filipino workers and insisted that \\"he would not have waited until now to ask people not to do so.\\" =In the Philippines= Amid rumors of OFW abuse in Taiwan regarding the incident, former policeman Abner Afuang burned the Taiwanese flag in protest and urged the Taiwanese to \\"show some respect\\". Contingency measures were being arranged for OFWs in case the situation escalates according to Undersecretary Abigail Valte, deputy presidential spokesperson. Harry Roque, an associate professor at the University of the Philippines College of Law, stated that Taiwan is not a recognized sovereign body, hence has no right to force the Philippines into signing a fishing agreement. Under international law however, he said that Taiwan is entitled to compensation and an apology which should not be made by any higher ranking Philippine official other than the Manila Economic and Cultural Office representative. Governmental =Philippines= Deputy Presidential spokesperson Abigail Valte said the ramming by a Taiwanese boat in Philippine territorial waters as \\"an aggressive act.\\" Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) spokesman Commander Armand Balilo stated that the Filipino personnel had been properly carrying out their duties. He was quoted as saying, \\"If somebody died, they deserve sympathy but not an apology.\\" PCG Commandant Admiral Rodolfo Isorena vowed a thorough investigation into the incident and has already relieved 11 PCG personnel. On May 15, President Benigno Aquino III assigned Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) chairman Amadeo R. Perez, Jr. to be his personal representative to convey \\"his and the Filipino people‚Äôs deep regret and apology to the family\\". When asked if this is an apology on behalf of the Philippine government, the presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda replied: \\"You take my statement as it is.\\" Aquino also tasked the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to conduct a probe on the incident however rejected to investigate the incident with the Taiwanese government. Presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda also added that the video of the shooting incident will also be part of the investigation. =Taiwan= Premier Jiang Yi-huah making public statement regarding the shooting incident at the Executive Yuan. May 9, 2013, on the day of incident, the Republic of China (Taiwan) Ministry of Foreign Affair expressed the concern to the government of the Philippines and urge them to investigate and bring the murder to justice. The ROC government issued a formal condemnation to the unjustified act by the Filipino officials on May 11. President Ma Ying- jeou subsequently demanded the Filipino government to respond to these four solemn requests within the next 72 hours: * Issue a formal apology * Speed up of the investigation into the fisherman's death, and punish the perpetrators * Compensate the deceased fisherman's family * Start talks over fishing rights in the overlapped EEZ area. The ROC government urged the Filipino government to act upon these requests without delay, or the Filipino representative would be sent back to Manila. On May 12, Taiwan sent additional three Coast Guard cutters and one Navy warship carrying a S70-C helicopter to safeguard the Taiwanese fishing boats within its southern EEZ waters, and ignoring the Filipino EEZ claim. Next day, on May 15, one hour passed the 72-hour deadline, Minister of Foreign Affairs David Lin termed the Philippines' response as ambiguous and needed more \\"clarity,\\" and was not at all satisfied with the Filipino responses to the four requests. With the deterioration of the diplomatic relations between both sides, Premier Jiang Yi-huah issued several sanctions to the Filipino authorities, and authorized a joint Navy and Coast Guard \\"Safety and Rescue Drill\\" which involved Kidd-class DDG ROCS Ma Kong, La Fayette-class FFG ROCS Chen De carrying one S-70C, Mirage 2000-5 and F-CK-1 IDF fighters, E-2 early-warning aircraft, as well as Coast Guard cutters at the overlapped EEZ area on the next day. In the meantime, Minister of Foreign Affairs David Lin issued a \\"Red Alert\\" traveling status to the Philippines, strongly discouraged any Taiwanese from traveling to the Philippines, signifying boycotting of tourism to the Philippines for political purposes, such as Boracay and other scenic spots. As of 21 May 2013, Boracay's hotels and resorts have been reporting cancellations by Taiwanese tourists, costing an estimated $55.3 million in revenue losses. =Others= * ‚Äì China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying strongly condemned the Philippines' \\"barbaric\\" shooting of the Taiwanese fishing boat and strongly urged the Philippines to \\"investigate the case immediately and handle the issue properly\\". Sino-Filipino diplomatic relations have deteriorated after the Scarborough Shoal dispute and the Manila hostage crisis in 2010, which resulted in the deaths of eight Hong Kong tourists by former PNP officer Rolando Mendoza. * - United States Department of State spokesperson Patrick Ventrell stated that the USA welcomes the Philippines' pledge to conduct a full and transparent investigation, urging all parties to ensure maritime safety and to refrain from \\"actions that could escalate tensions in the region and undermine the prospects for a diplomatic or other peaceful resolution of differences\\". Later, the Chairman Steve Chabot and ranking member Eni Faleomavaega of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific made a joint statement indicating that this attack happened \\"in waters considered by both Taiwan and the Philippines to be within Taiwan‚Äôs 200 nautical-mile-from-shore Exclusive Economic Zone.\\" Further, it states that \\"A government vessel's shooting of an unarmed fishing boat is an act of violence, and is in violation of international law. Therefore, we call upon the Philippines to promptly and sincerely respond to the requests of the Taiwan government to apologize, punish the perpetrators, and provide proper compensation to the victim's family based on humanitarian grounds.\\"  Aftermath  On 7 August the same year, the Philippine National Bureau of Investigation recommended that eight Philippine Coast Guard personnel involved in the shooting should be charged with homicide, they also recommended sanctions against four other personal who attempting to alter evidence. The next day on 8 August, a Philippine delegation apologized to the victim's family. In response, Taiwan lifted the sanctions that had been imposed against the Philippines. Relations between the two countries subsequently returned to normal. In September 2019, the eight were convicted and sentenced to 8‚Äì15 years; each of the eight was also ordered to pay P100,000 in civil damages.

The FAM185A gene is found on the positive strand of Chromosome 7 at 7q22.1. The gene begins 102,389,399bp from the p-terminus of the chromosome and ends at 102,449,672bp from the p-terminus; it covers a total of 73,308 basepairs.FAM185A Gene page at NCBI The protein encoded by this gene is characterized by the presence of multiple copies of DUF4098 (Domain of unknown function, 4098) near its C-terminus. It is described as a Long Interspersed Nuclear Element (LINE), a subclass of penaeid repetitive elements (PREs).  Homology  Homologs have been found in many animal species, but no fungal, plant, or other more distantly related homologs have been found. Clades that are known to have FAM185A orthologs include: *Chordata *Echinodermata *Hemichordata *Arthropoda *Mollusca *Annelida *Cnidaria *Heterokontophyta *Choanoflagellatea Clades in which no orthologs or homologs have been found include: *Fungi *Plantae *Nematoda *Platyhelminthes *Rotifera *Tardigrada *Nemertea *Bryozoa  Protein   Isoforms  Two protein forming isoforms are known to be transcribed from the FAM185A gene. Isoform 1 is the longer isoform, resulting in a protein 392 amino acids long. Isoform 2 is a shortened version of Isoform 1 resulting from alternative splicing of the mRNA. Isoform 2 forms a 275aa protein; it is missing a 118aa segment near the N-terminus of the protein.  DUF4098  Domain of Unknown Function 4098 is domain found in all FAM185A orthologs, as well as in some other non-orthologous species. DUF4098 is a c-terminal repetitive bacterial domain and is part of the pfam13345 family of domains and the superfamily cl16248.  Pseudogene  Only one paralog, a pseudogene, for FAM185A exists in humans. The pseudogene, known as FAM185BP (Family of sequence similarity 185, member B, pseudogene), is also located on chromosome 7, from 76,713,203bp to 76,751,689bp. The pseudogene encodes a non-functional 365aa protein, of which the first 356 residues are identical to that of FAM185A isoform 1.  Expression  Expression of FAM185a protein in mouse embryonic tissue by stage of development.  Promoter  The predicted promoter region for FAM185A transcription is located just upstream of the gene from 102,388,867bp to 102,389,996bp of chromosome 7. This region overlaps slightly with the translational start site of the protein, located at approximately 102,389,656bp of the genomic DNA. Over 200 potential transcription factor binding sites have been identified within the promoter region.  Tissue expression  FAM185A is moderately expressed in select nervous and developmental related tissues. SAGE data shows expression in the brain, cerebral cortex, retina, and skin of human tissues. EST abundance data from Unigene shows increased expression in bone marrow, the adrenal gland, the brain, and muscle tissue. It is also more highly expressed in fetal tissues than adult tissues.  Subcellular expression  The subcellular location of the protein is not definitively known, but the protein is predicted to be either imported into the mitochondria or nucleus or to remain within the cytoplasm.  Differential expression in mice While little data is currently available on differential expression in humans, FAM185a expression is greatly decreased in ROR1-alpha knockout mice and toll-like receptor 5 knockout mice.NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus [www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo] Mice also show a decrease in FAM185a expression in tissues that have been treated with Reversine, indicating the protein's potential role relates to stem cell differentiation during development. GEO profiles for mice also show that FAM185a expression begins after fertilization, and continues to be high throughout embryonic development.  Interactions   Interacting proteins  There are currently no confirmed protein interactions with FAM185A.  Interacting molecules  Three molecules have been found to interact with FAM185a in mice: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, and benzopyrene. These interactions are not yet confirmed for the human protein, FAM185A.  Clinical significance  Currently, no diseases are known to be related to FAM185A mutations.

It was noted for publishing Locomotive Magazine, amongst many other highly regarded titles. It was also notable as one of the first stock photo libraries, in this case specialising in railway images.  History  The company was preceded in the final years of the 19th century by 'F. Moore', a railway artist and photographer who published Moore's Monthly Magazine, the first widely popular railway magazine. In actuality, 'F. Moore' was the pseudonymous pen-name for two brothers, A.R. Bell and A. Morton Bell, both apprentices at the Stratford Works of the Great Eastern Railway. They began as a photo library, trading between the increasing number of amateur photographers of railways and the growing interest of enthusiasts. A third brother, Walter John Bell, and another apprentice, A.C.W. Lowe, became involved from 1896 with the launch of Moore's Monthly Magazine. From the 13th issue in January 1897, this was renamed as The Locomotive Magazine. The Locomotive Publishing Company Limited was established in 1899.The Locomotive Publishing Company Limited was registered with Companies House on 28 April 1899, as company number 61795. They are still registered, as a dormant company. It began at 9 South Place, Finsbury, moving within the year to 102 Charing Cross Road and in 1903 to their better known long-term address of 3 Amen Corner, London. Amen Corner is at the west end of Paternoster Row where it joins Ave Maria Lane, near St Paul's Cathedral. Paternoster Row was long associated with the publishing trade in London. This building had been built as a residence in the 17th century, during the great rebuilding of the area after the 1666 Great Fire. After being bombed out during the London Blitz of 1940, they moved to Horseferry Road. In 1956, the company was sold to another publisher specialising in railways, Ian Allan and relocated to Surrey. This sale had been precipitated by the death duties owing after the death of one of the three partners, W.G. Tilling. In 1992 the archive, together with its associated rights, was acquired by the National Railway Museum, with the assistance of the National Heritage Memorial Fund.  Notable people   Bell, Arthur Robert  One of the two founding brothers, and editor of the Locomotive Magazine. Of the brothers, he was the one who dedicated most of his career to the publishing company. \\"A man of huge girth with a mass of white hair\\".  Bell, Arthur Morton  Although one of the initial two brothers behind the publishing company, he focused on his engineering career. After serving an apprenticeship at the GER's Stratford Works, he rose to a position of some seniority in the locomotive department. He was involved in the trials of Holden's oil-burning locomotives and this work on oil firing would be a theme for the rest of his career, around the world; at the Kursk, Kharkov and Sevastopol Railway, the Austrian State Railways, the railways of Sicily, and, in the United States, on the Pennsylvania, the California Southern, and the Los Angeles Terminal. In 1897 he was appointed the first manager of the GER's new wagon shops at Temple Mills. By 1900, he joined the Shell company and traveled throughout Europe, Turkey and Egypt as a consultant for oil fuels. In 1903 he was appointed Carriage and Wagon Superintendent of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, a post that he held until 1924. For his war work during World War I, when Stratford Works was employed on munitions work, he was awarded the OBE. He was elected a Member of the ILocoE Council in 1924, and later made a Vice-president. He was a frequent contributor to the Locomotive Magazine. He also wrote Locomotives: their Construction, Maintenance and Operation, although published by Virtue rather than Locomotive Publishing. It was published only a few months before his death, on 10 February 1936 at home in Hampstead when aged 72 years.  Bell, Walter John  The third of the brothers to join, he became the fourth partner in 1896 with the formation of the company. His professional career remained focussed on engineering though, particularly through a long career with Taike and Carlton Ltd. of Victoria Street, London. He was also one of the founding members of the Institution of Locomotive Engineers. His publishing career included being the Consulting Editor of The Locomotive. In addition he authored a number of books on locomotive engineering and on railway history, some co-authored with A.C.W. Lowe. Died 18 September 1938 at Malden, Kingston upon Thames, aged 64.  A.C.W. Lowe  A.C.W. Lowe was one of the original founders of the company. A graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, he lived at Gosfield Hall, Halstead, Essex. The extent of his involvement with the magazine was extensive, although now difficult to ascertain. He may have been an initial financial backer, and remained a major shareholder. His extensive writing for the magazine was anonymous, although he is known to have written a long and notable series of articles on Great Eastern locomotives, published between 1901 and 1913. He also acted as proofreader for The Locomotive, throughout his life. He died on 3 February 1942, aged 76.  Tilling, William George  Tilling was a trained printer, rather than a railwayman, and became a director of the Locomotive Publishing Co. He took a keen amateur interest in railways though and was an early member of the Institution of Locomotive Engineers. He wrote a number of monographs on locomotives, The Locomotives of the London, Brighton & South Coast Railway (1920) and the three-volume Locomotives of the Southern Railway. He died on 25 July 1956. This death precipitated the sale to Ian Allan by the two remaining partners. Tilling was a freemason and also wrote A Short History of the Lodge of St. James, No. 765: 1859-1959. This was completed after his death by Gilbert Fabes and published posthumously.  Photo library  From the every first, the publishing company operated as one of the first specialist photo libraries. Railway photography was increasing in popularity at this time, both for photographers and in demand for their work. Many of these photographers were amateurs, with a keen interest in both photography and their railway subject matter, but without the commercial focus to make a full-time career of it. The Locomotive Publishing Co. acted as a clearing house between them and publishers, offering one of the first of such commercial opportunities for such part-time, although skilled, photographers. LPC initially issued its photographs as 10√ó8\\" and 8¬Ω√ó6¬Ω\\" prints or as 'cartes de visite'. Postcards were increasingly popular around this period, with the increase in mass holidays and excursions, themselves reliant on the expanding railway traffic. The company also began to sell photographs as postcards, particularly as themed sets. Some works, particularly for the more populist photographs were coloured. Some paintings were drawn or painted directly, particularly by John Rudd, another artist working under the 'F Moore' pseudonym. The LPC archive now forms part of the collection of the National Railway Museum.

History The Brigidine Sisters established a convent and school at Windsor in 1948, the second such founded by the order in England and Wales. Queensmead, the Victorian bricked mansion the Sisters moved into, remained one of the school's main buildings. The school became run by lay staff but retained its Catholic ethos and religious character. During the early 2000s, the school experienced financial difficulties; pupil and staff numbers declined and the school was threatened with closure. In 2011 parents and governors discussed a possibility of the school entering the state sector but an agreement could not be reached. In 2012, further funding was secured and the school remained open and independent. In 2018 it was renamed from Brigidine to Queensmead. Closure After years of financial difficulties, the school closed permanently on 31 January 2019. At the time of closure, the Head of Education was Simon Larter, and the Head of Business Affairs Dawn Fleming.http://queensmeadwindsor.org.uk/site/assets/files/1049/staff_directory_2016-2017_updated_march_2017.pdf Alumni *Tamara Mellon, fashion designer *Susan Sheridan, actressSusan Sheridan - Personal Website See also * Catholic Church in England References External links *Official website *Ofsted Report 2009 (as Brigidine School) *Profile on the ISC website Category:Girls' schools in Berkshire Category:Educational institutions established in 1948 Category:Independent schools in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Category:Member schools of the Independent Schools Association (UK) Category:Roman Catholic independent schools in the Diocese of Portsmouth Category:1948 establishments in England Category:Brigidine schools ","title":"Queensmead School Windsor"},{"id":"39361825","text":"St. Andrew Abbey-Cleveland is a Benedictine monastery in Cleveland, Ohio.

Many live recordings were made at the club. Jessica Williams was the house pianist for a number of years. History In 1969, Freddie Herrera bought Dino and Carlo's Bar in the North Beach section of San Francisco. He changed the name to Keystone Korner, a reference to Keystone Cops, because of its proximity to the Central Police Station on the opposite corner of Emery Lane. Keystone Korner began as a topless bar, but quickly changed direction when songwriter Nick Gravenites convinced Herrera that live music would bring in more customers. The strength of the music scene in San Francisco allowed Herrera to book young musicians who would go on to stellar careers. Patrons filled the club to hear new talents such as Elvin Bishop, Neal Schon, Boz Scaggs, and The Pointer Sisters. Herrera's success made it possible to move across the San Francisco Bay and open a larger room, called Keystone Berkeley. He then sold the Keystone Korner to Todd Barkan who converted the nightclub from a popular rock venue to an internationally famous jazz club. Barkan paid $12,500 () for the Keystone Korner in 1972, and hired prominent jazz musicians to play there. Early gigs by performers including Sonny Rollins and Art Blakey established the Keystone as one of the best jazz clubs in the nation‚Äîa reputation that continued to build as musicians Miles Davis, McCoy Tyner, Bill Evans, Betty Carter and Stan Getz appeared on its stage. Faced with economic challenges Barkan was forced to close the Keystone Korner in 1983. In 2019, Barkan and Michelin-starred chef Robert Wiedmaier re-launched the Keystone Korner in Baltimore‚Äôs Harbor East. Bassist and bandleader Ron Carter and his trio with guitarist Russell Malone and pianist Donald Vega opened the club on April 30, 2019.

It is characterized by a large, grassy meadow which slopes gently upward to a large knoll overlooking the Brandywine River. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The park is a unit of Delaware's Wilmington State Parks. History Rockford is one of the oldest parks in the city of Wilmington. It was originally conceived by philanthropist and conservationist William Poole Bancroft, who played an instrumental role in the creation of other city, state, and federal parks in Delaware (such as First State National Historical Park). Bancroft was one of the primary sponsors behind the Delaware legislature's creation of the Board of Park Commissioners in 1883, and he served on the Board from its inception until 1922. He owned the land that houses Rockford Park today, and offered to donate it for park land at the very first meeting of the Board of Park Commissioners. At the recommendation of Frederick Law Olmsted, the Board instead focused first on establishing the nearby Brandywine Park. Once that was done, Olmsted visited Bancroft's Rockford land in 1889 and issued a positive report to the Board recommending accepting the land and establishing the park. Later in 1889, Bancroft donated 59 acres of his property to form Rockford Park, and he convinced the du Pont family to donate an additional 9 acres of land. and In 1901, a 75-foot stone building named Rockford Tower was constructed to serve two purposes, as both a water tower and an observation tower. It contains a steel cylinder water tank, surrounded by a staircase which leads to the highest level of the tower. On the highest level, large stone arches allow for a view of the park and the Brandywine River below. Memorials There are three notable memorials in Rockford Park. The first is Canby Seat, a granite bench and memorial to botanist William M. Canby. Canby was the first President of the Board of Park Commissioners and he was responsible for allocating the funds which developed the park after Bancroft donated the land. The stone bench was constructed in 1905 and provides a scenic view of the Brandywine in a spot which was one of Canby's favorites. The second memorial is a statue of Rear Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont near the park's main entrance. The statue was commissioned by Congress in 1882 and sculpted by Launt Thompson in 1884. It originally stood in Washington, D.C.'s Dupont Circle, which was named after the Civil War hero, but as several family members considered it an insufficient memorial for the national capital, they received permission to replace it with a new memorial which they would fund themselves. The statue was moved to Rockford Park in 1917. The last memorial is to William Poole Bancroft. The Bancroft Memorial is a stone terrace with a semicircular stone outcropping. On the outcropping is a large stone with a cast bronze plaque commemorating Bancroft's accomplishments. The memorial was constructed in 1937 and is centrally located within the park.

The Karoonda Highway begins at Murray Bridge East. It heads north-east to the town of Karoonda, and from there, continues on to Alawoona. Thereafter it heads north to Kingston Road, where it turns east to Loxton, its north-eastern terminus. Bookpurnong Road continues on from Loxton, connecting the highway to Berri and the Sturt Highway.  History  In 2006, the local governments in the area, including Loxton Waikerie Council and Karoonda East Murray Council, called for the Loxton to Murray Bridge section of the B55 road route to be named Karoonda Highway, after the major town along the route. The B55 route actually extended past Loxton to Berri, which the councils initially didn't realise. By 2011, the route had been renamed Karoonda Highway from Loxton to Murray Bridge, and Bookpurnong Road north of Loxton to Berri. In 2014, Karoonda Highway was rated as one of the worst roads in the states by South Australian motorists.

It was released as a white-square-shaped vinyl 45, as a 'limited' edition release. Both sides featured the track.http://www.davidbowie.com/news/next-day-white-vinyl-square-45-due-51661 The single reached 179 on the UK Singles Chart.

It was directed by Floria Sigismondi, who also directed the video for the preceding single, \\"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\\", and features English actor Gary Oldman and French actress Marion Cotillard, along with David Bowie. The video depicts Bowie performing in a bar called The Decameron‚Äîreference to the Boccaccio's masterpiece known also for its satirical depiction of clergymen‚Äîand populated with religious figures and half-naked women. The video also portrays Marion Cotillard's character (who is presumed to be a prostitute) suffering from a gruesome stigmata, with the detailed depiction of the blood bursting from her wounds, while the priest is dancing with her. Other horror elements such as eyeballs served as food are also present. The music video ends with the stigmatized woman apparently born again as an innocent girl and Bowie saying simply, \\"Thank you Gary, thank you Marion, thank you everybody.\\" Bowie then disappears. Controversy Bowie, Cotillard and Oldman as depicted in the video The video gained wide attention and caused a controversy.

A YouTube spokeswoman stated: \\"With the massive volume of videos on our site, sometimes we make the wrong call. When it's brought to our attention that a video has been removed mistakenly, we act quickly to reinstate it.\\" The video also triggered many backlashes and criticisms from various Christian organizations. Bill Donohue, the leader of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, heavily criticized it and David Bowie, calling the video \\"a mess\\" and referring to Bowie as \\"a switch-hitting, bisexual, senior citizen from London\\". The former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, also criticized the song as \\"juvenile\\" and urged other Christians to \\"rise above.\\" He also stated that he doubted whether Bowie would have the courage to use Islamic imagery.\\" Also, Andrea Williams of Christian Concern questioned the point of the video while Jack Volero of Catholic Voices referred to it as \\"desperate\\". As a reaction to the controversy and Donohue's criticisms, Bowie's official website issued a response, titled \\"The Next Day the day after\\".

Jessica Meir with Christina Koch (right) of ISS Expedition 61 in 2019, before making the first all-woman spacewalk. The first woman in space, Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, flew in 1963. However space flight programs did not include women after her until the 1980s. Since then many women from a range of countries have worked in space, though overall women are still significantly less often chosen than men to go to space. The first woman to go to the Moon is planned for 2024, as part of the Artemis program. Three countries maintain active space programs that have included women: China, Russia, and the United States. In addition, a number of other countries ‚Äî Canada, France, India, Iran, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom ‚Äî have sent women into orbit or space on Russian or US missions. Most women in space have been United States citizens, with missions on the Space Shuttle and on the International Space Station. Women in space face many of the same challenges faced by men: physical difficulties posed by non-Earth conditions and psychological stresses of isolation and separation. Scientific studies on female amphibians and non-human mammals generally show no adverse effect from short space missions. Women in space programs Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space, 1969 Although the first woman flew into space in 1963, very early in crewed space exploration, it would not be until almost 20 years later that another flew. And while a number of American women successfully underwent the astronaut selection process in the early 1960s they were not eligible to be astronauts: all astronauts were required to be military test pilots, a career not available to women at the time. NASA opened the space program to female applicants in 1978, in response to the new anti- discrimination laws of the time. When Sally Ride became the first female U.S. astronaut to go into space, the press asked her questions about her reproductive organs and whether she would cry if things went wrong on the job. Women with children also face questions about how they would compare to traditional expectations of motherhood. Shannon Lucid, one of the first group of female US astronauts, remembers questions by the press on how her children would handle her being a mother in space. Women are often expected to be the ones mainly responsible for child-rearing, which can impact their career. Soviet Union and Russia The first woman in space was a Soviet cosmonaut. Valentina Tereshkova launched with the Vostok 6 mission on June 16, 1963. The second woman overall to go into space was also a cosmonaut: Svetlana Savitskaya in 1982 on the Soyuz T-7 mission. Savitskaya became the first woman to fly to space twice on the Soyuz T-12 mission on July 25, 1984, and the first woman to walk in space when she performed extravehicular activity (EVA) outside the Salyut 7 space station on the Soyuz T-12 mission. =Post-Soviet Russia= Russian Yelena V. Kondakova became the first woman to travel for both the Soyuz programme and on the Space Shuttle. Yelena Serova became the first female Russian cosmonaut to visit the International Space Station on September 26, 2014.

The first US woman to go on an EVA was Kathryn (\\"Kathy\\") Sullivan on the STS-41-G, which launched on October 11, 1984. Mae Jemison became the first woman of color in space in 1992. The first woman to pilot the Space Shuttle was Eileen Collins who piloted Discovery on STS-63 (in 1995) and Atlantis on STS-84, and became the first female Shuttle commander on STS-93. The first woman to be on an ISS expedition crew was Susan Helms on Expedition 2, which lasted from March 2001 until August 2001. United States NASA astronaut Kathleen Rubins became the 60th woman to fly in space when she launched to the International Space Station on July 6, 2016, serving as a flight engineer on Expedition 48 and Expedition 49. She returned in October 2016, having spent 12 hours and 46 minutes on EVA and 115 days, 12 hours and 46 minutes in space as part of these missions. During her stay on ISS she also conducted numerous experiments including some in the area of biology. She was the first person to sequence DNA in space.

Canada Canadian astronaut Julie Payette in space in 2009 (STS-127) Roberta Bondar was the first Canadian woman in space, and the second Canadian. She flew on the Space Shuttle Discovery in January 1992. Another Canadian woman astronaut is Julie Payette from Montreal. Payette was part of the crew of STS-96, on the Space Shuttle Discovery from May 27 to June 6, 1999. During the mission, the crew performed the first manual docking of the Shuttle to the International Space Station, and delivered four tons of logistics and supplies to the station. On Endeavour in 2009 for STS-127, Payette served as a mission specialist. Her main responsibility was to operate the Canadarm robotic arm from the space station. Payette was sworn in as the 29th Governor-General of Canada on October 2, 2017. Japan Chiaki Mukai at her training. In 1985, Chiaki Mukai was selected as one of three Japanese Payload Specialist candidates for the First Material Processing Test (Spacelab-J) that flew aboard STS-47 in 1992. She also served as a back-up payload specialist for the Neurolab (STS-90) mission. Mukai has logged over 566 hours in space. She flew aboard STS-65 in 1994 and STS-95 in 1998. She is the first Japanese woman to fly in space, and the first Japanese citizen to fly twice. Naoko Yamazaki at NASA Johnson Space Center, 2009 Naoko Yamazaki became the second Japanese woman to fly into space with her launch on April 5, 2010. Yamazaki entered space on the shuttle Discovery as part of mission STS-131. She returned to Earth on April 20, 2010.Harwood, William. \\"Shuttle Lifts Off for Space Station\\", The New York Times, New York City, April 5, 2010. Retrieved on 2010-04-05. Yamazaki worked on ISS hardware development projects in the 1990s. She is an aerospace engineer and also holds a master's degree in that field. She was selected for astronaut training in 1999 and was certified by 2001. She was a mission specialist on her 2010 space shuttle flight, and spent 362 hours in space. Yamazaki worked on robotics and transitioned through the reorganization of Japanese spaceflight organization in 2003 when NASDA (National Space Development Agency) merged with ISAS (Institute of Space and Astronautical Science) and NAL (National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan). The new organization was called JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency). China In 2012, the Chinese space program sent their first woman to space. Liu Yang, the first Chinese woman in space China's first female astronaut candidates, chosen in 2010 from the ranks of fighter pilots, were required to be married mothers. The Chinese stated that married women were \\"more physically and psychologically mature\\" and that the rule that they had have had children was because of concerns that spaceflight would harm their reproductive organs (including unreleased ova). The unknown nature of the effects of spaceflight on women was also noted. However, the director of the China Astronaut Centre has stated that marriage is a preference but not a strict limitation. Part of why they were so strict was because it was their first astronaut selection and they were trying be \\"extra cautious\\". China's first woman astronaut, Liu Yang, was married but had no children at the time of her flight in June 2012.

Soyuz TMA-9 transported two-thirds of ISS Expedition 14 to the space station along with Ansari. Ansari performed several experiments on behalf of the European Space Agency. By 2015 four women were classified as \\"space flight participants\\": Helen Sharman, Claudie Haigner√© (born Andr√©-Deshays), Anousheh Ansari, and Yi So-yeon. Fatalities Payload Specialist Christa McAuliffe and mission specialist Judith Resnik became the first women to die on a space mission when the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded less than 2 minutes after launch with the loss of all hands. In the 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster the crew was lost on re-entry, including mission specialists Kalpana Chawla and Laurel Clark. Physical effects of space on women Kathryn D. Sullivan poses for a picture before donning her space suit and extravehicular mobility unit in the airlock onboard the April 25, 1990 shuttle mission that deployed the Hubble Space Telescope. Female astronauts are subject to the same general physical effects of space travel as men. These include physiological changes due to weightlessness such as loss of bone and muscle mass, health threats from cosmic rays, dangers due to vacuum and temperature, and psychological stress. NASA reports initially argued that menstruation could pose serious health risks or have a negative effect on performance, although it is now dealt with as a matter of routine. Astronaut clothing for men has been based on technology used to make bras, and since women have been sent to space the previously men focused clothing has been reconsidered addressing the issues and needs for clothing like space suits for extravehicular activity (EVA) and bras, e.g. for exercise in micro-g environments. Low number of produced smaller sized space suits has been hindering women astronauts to do EVAs because of a lack of fitting suits. Furthermore space toilet designs did not have women in mind, until October 2020 when the first toilet with better design for women (as well as men) was delivered to the ISS. Radiation and uterine and breast cancer RAD on the MSL (2011 - 2013). Both men and women are affected by radiation. Massive particles are a concern for astronauts outside the earth's magnetic field who receive solar particles from solar proton events (SPE) and galactic cosmic rays from cosmic sources. These high-energy charged nuclei are blocked by Earth's magnetic field but pose a major health concern for astronauts traveling to the moon and to any distant location beyond the earth orbit. Evidence indicates past solar particle event (SPE) radiation levels that would have been lethal for unprotected astronauts. However, due to the currently used risk models for endometrial, ovarian and breast cancer, women at NASA can currently only spend half as much time on missions as men, which limits their career options compared to men. German standards for pregnant woman set a limit of 50 mSv/year for the gonads (ovaries) and uterus, and 150 mSv/year for the breasts. Astronauts on Apollo and Skylab missions received on average 1.2 mSv/day and 1.4 mSv/day respectively. Exposures on the ISS average 0.4 mSv per day (150 mSv per year), although frequent crew rotations minimize risk to individuals. A trip to Mars with current technology might be related to measurements by the Mars Science Laboratory which for a 180-day journey estimated an exposure approximately 300 mSv, which would be equivalent of 24 CAT scans or \\"15 times an annual radiation limit for a worker in a nuclear power plant\\". Fertility A study published in 2005 in the International Journal of Impotence Research reported that short-duration missions (no longer than nine days) did not affect \\"the ability of astronauts to conceive and bear healthy children to term.\\" In another experiment, the frog Xenopus laevis successfully ovulated in space.Ronca, p. 218. Pregnancy NASA has not permitted pregnant astronauts to fly in space,Foster, p. 139. and there have been no pregnant women in space. However, various science experiments have dealt with some aspects of pregnancy. For air travel, the United States' Federal Aviation Administration recommends a limit of 1 mSv total for a pregnancy, and no more than 0.5 mSv per month. For fetus radiation increases the risk of childhood cancers. Additionally children of female astronauts could be sterile if the astronaut were exposed to too much ionizing radiation during the later stages of a pregnancy. Ionizing radiation may destroy the egg cells of a female fetus inside a pregnant woman, rendering the offspring infertile even when grown. While no human had gestated in space , scientists have conducted experiments on non-human mammalian gestation. Space missions that have studied \\"reproducing and growing mammals\\" include Kosmos 1129 and 1154, as the Shuttle missions STS-66, 70, 72, and 90.Ronca, p. 222. A Soviet experiment in 1983 showed that a rat that orbited while pregnant later gave birth to healthy babies; the babies were \\"thinner and weaker than their Earth-based counterparts and lagged behind a bit in their mental development,\\" although the developing pups eventually caught up. The lack of knowledge about pregnancy and birth control in micro-gravity has been noted in regards to conducting long-term space missions. =Post-natal= A 1998 Space Shuttle mission showed that rodent Rattus mothers were either not producing enough milk or not feeding their offspring in space. However, a later study on pregnant rats showed that the animals successfully gave birth and lactated normally. To date no human children have been born in space; neither have children gone into space. Nevertheless, the idea of children in space is taken seriously enough that some have discussed how to write curriculum for children in space-colonizing families.

The role of IL-36 in inflammatory diseases is under investigation. There are four members of the IL-36 family which bind to the IL-36 receptor (IL1RL2/IL-1Rrp2/IL-36 receptor dimer) with varying affinities. IL36A, IL36B, and IL36G are IL-36 receptor agonists. IL36RA is an IL-36 receptor antagonist, inhibiting IL-36R signaling. The agonists are known to activate NF-Œ∫B and mitogen-activated protein kinases to induce various proinflammatory mediators. Binding of the IL-36R agonists to IL-1Rp2 recruits IL-1RAcP, activating the signaling pathway. IL-36Ra binds to IL-36R, preventing the recruitment of IL-1RAcP. It has been found to activate T cell proliferation and release of IL-2. Before the functions of the IL-36 cytokines were determined, they were named as derivatives of IL-1F; they were renamed to their current designations in 2010. The genes encoding for the IL-36 cytokines are found on chromosome 2q13. Due to their predominant expression in epithelial tissues, IL-36 cytokines are believed to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of skin diseases, especially that of psoriasis. IL-36 has also been linked to psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and Sj√∂gren's syndrome. IL-36 must be cleaved at the N-terminus to become active, but the enzyme responsible for this is not known.

He has also established many bouldering problems in areas such as Magic Wood in Switzerland, Rocklands in South Africa, and in Rocky Mountain National Park in the United States. Woods has climbed more than twenty bouldering problems graded , making him the most prolific climber of that grade. He also won many competitions such as the U.S. National Bouldering Championship (American Bouldering Series), the Teva Mountain Games, and some international competitions. Biography Woods began climbing at the age of 5 in Dallas, Texas and immediately became fascinated by the sport. In 1997, when he was 8 years old, his family moved to Longmont, Colorado. Woods then began competing and was part of a junior climbing team coached by Justin Sjong and Jimmie Redo. In 2003, he climbed his first bouldering problem rated , Fuck You Finger. Then in 2004 he made the first ascent of Echale, grading it when he was 15. He won the American Bouldering Series national championship in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2013 and the Teva Mountain Games in the bouldering category in 2006, 2007 and, 2010. On 19 June 2007, when he was traveling in the Rocky Mountain National Park in the area of Chaos Canyon, he made the first ascent of Jade, formerly named Green Project 45, a project he worked for several years with Dave Graham. He graded it , making it his hardest problem until then. However, it was later reassessed, and its grade lowered to . In early 2008 at the age of 18, Woods moved to Innsbruck, Austria and spent part of his time training with Kilian Fischhuber and David Lama. In May 2008, he made the first ascent of In Search of Time Lost at Magic Wood in Switzerland and evaluated it . In November 2011, Woods began filming a climbing movie called Welcome to the Hood with Paul Robinson, Guntram J√∂rg, and Anthony Gullsten. The filming would last five months, during which they climbed at some of the most famous and difficult bouldering sites in the world. The first part of the film was the Magic Wood in Switzerland, where Woods climbed Somewhere in Between . Woods is the nephew of famous actor Kevin Bacon. Competition Despite primarily focusing on hard outdoor bouldering, Daniel Woods is the most accomplished American male competition climber. He has won the ABS National Championship 9 times, the SCS National Championship, and has competed in many IFSC World Cup events earning a gold medal in the Vail World Cup in 2010.http://www.ifsc- climbing.org/index.php/world-competition#!comp=1247&cat;=6 Woods also has the most open wins at the Hueco Tanks Rock Rodeo including another first place in 2017.

Early life and family Dayanidhi was born on 3 March 1954 in Kilinochchi in northern Ceylon. He hails from Thambasiddy near Point Pedro. He worked as private tutor of English language and acquired the name Daya Master. Daya Master married his wife, a teacher, in 1996. They have a daughter. Militant It's alleged that when the Indian Peace Keeping Force occupied northern Sri Lanka in the late 1980s, the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF), an Indian-backed Tamil militant group, arrested and tortured Daya Master for supporting the LTTE. It's alleged that Daya Master only survived death due to the pity shown by EPRLF commander Sugi. Daya Master grew closer to LTTE in the early 1990s and during the 1994 peace process he, on behalf of the LTTE, met with dignitaries from the South who were visiting Jaffna peninsula. Later, with the help of Colonel Soosai, he became the LTTE's media spokesman. He came to prominence as the LTTE's public relations man during the 2002‚Äì06 cease fire. After suffering a heart attack Daya Master was admitted to the private Apollo Hospital in Colombo on 13 July 2006 to undergo an angiogram. He was transported from Kilinochchi to Colombo with military escort in the Mitsubishi Montero belonging to UPFA provincial minister Ananda Sarath Kumara Rathnayake. The Sinhalese nationalist National Movement Against Terrorism staged a protest outside the hospital on 14 July 2006, demanding Daya Master's arrest. Daya Master was discharged on 15 July 2006. He returned to Kilinochchi, escorted by the Sri Lankan military and the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM). It was reported that the SLMM had paid the hospital bill. The SLMM denied the reports. It was alleged that the Sri Lankan Government had allowed Daya Master to travel to Colombo in return for the LTTE releasing Sub Inspector Bandujeewa Bopitigoda. Bopitigoda was released on 26 August 2006. Daya Master and his colleague George Master surrendered to the Sri Lankan military at Puthumatalan in 20 April 2009, just days before the civil war ended with the defeat of the LTTE. The two men were arrested and taken to Colombo. They were taken to the 4th floor of the Criminal Investigation Department headquarters in Colombo to be interrogated. The CID's 4th floor is notorious for alleged torture, rape and other human rights abuses. After being \\"rehabilitated\\" the two men were sent to jail. Days after defecting, Daya Master claimed that the LTTE had shot dead two hundred civilians trying to flee the fighting. After the end of the war in May 2009 Daya Master and Karuna Amman were flown to Puthumatalan by the Sri Lankan military to identify the body of LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran. Daya Master and George Master were detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) but were not charged. They were released on bail by Colombo Chief Magistrate Nishantha Hapuarachchi in September 2009 after the CID claimed that there wasn't any evidence to prosecute the two men under the PTA. One of the bail conditions was that they both had to report to CID headquarters in Colombo once a month but this condition was relaxed in February 2010 after which they only had to report to the CID office in Jaffna. Later life Daya Master then started working on the news desk for Dish Asia Network (DAN TV), a somewhat pro-government broadcaster based in northern Sri Lanka owned and operated by one-time Minister of the Mahinda Rajapaksa Cabinet- Douglas Devananda. In April 2013 Daya Master announced that he would contest the upcoming elections to Northern Provincial Council as a candidate for the governing United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA). It was reported that the UPFA was considering Daya Master to be its chief ministerial candidate.

A 1,400 Kg version followed in 1949, and the Renault 1,400 Kg soon became the more popular choice. A name change in 1956 saw the vans branded as the Renault Voltigeur (1,000 Kg) and the Renault Go√©lette (1,400 Kg), but in retrospect the Renault 1,000 Kg name is frequently preferred. Origins 1954 Renault Goelette The 1000 Kg was originally presented in 1945 as a prototype light van designed for the military, and was offered for general sales from February 1947. In the summer of 1944 the French Ministry of Industrial Production set out a prescriptive plan for the post war motor industry. It was headed by Paul-Marie Pons and so it was known as the Plan Pons. Under \\"The Plan\\", Renault and Peugeot (along with their Chenard & Walcker debtor/subsidiary) were restricted to making vans for the 1000‚Äì1400 kg market, while Citro√´n was to make small trucks of between 2 and 3.5 tonnes. In the event Citro√´n, which had already developed a van in the 1000 kG class before the war, went ahead with the design of the Citro√´n H Van, which was launched in 1947. It was the Citro√´n which would be the Renault's most effective rival in this sector, although the Renault would in the early years beat its rival on volumes thanks in part to the large number of Renaults produced for military and police usePascal Meunier, Laurent Jacquot et Jean- Yves Hardouin, Un si√®cle de v√©hicules de la Gendarmerie nationale, √©ditions E.T.A.I. and for other public sector vehicle operators such as the French postal service. Police versions gained the informal appellation ‚Äúpanier √† salade‚Äù (‚Äúpaddy wagon‚Äù), appearing in newsreels removing arrested suspects following instances of civil disturbance during the troubled 1950s or, more memorably for many United States and UK film-goers in the 1960s, removing Inspector Clouseau following his arrest in the wake of a successful bank raid. Renault followed the Plan Pons agreement and designed the 206 E1 following general pre-war design ideas. It had a chassis onto which the van body was bolted and the body was made, until 1950, by fitting metal panels to a wooden frame. At a time when French industrial wages were low, the Renault was quick and inexpensive to produce. Vehicle architecture In contrast to the rival Citro√´n H Van, Renault‚Äôs design applied a traditional approach, using a rear wheel drive layout and rigid axles. Large wheels combined with a short wheelbase allowed for a tight turning circle and good ground clearance. These features reflected plans for a four wheel drive version in anticipation of military sales and to deal with the poor state of many French roads, especially in the countryside, at this time. The rear-wheel drive and big wheels resulted in the vehicle's raised interior floor height. Renault saw a steady demand for the van, especially from public sector buyers, and 124,570 units vehicles were produced. By some criteria, it was France‚Äôs best selling vehicle in its class during the 1950s.Halwart Schrader et Jan P. Norbye, Le dictionnaire des camions, √©ditions MDM. Chronology The basic architecture and overall silhouette of the vehicle barely changed during a production run of nearly two decades, but there were numerous minor changes to the sheet metal, door hinge arrangements, front bumpers, lights and indicators as well as extensive adaptations for military and police versions. Later models, from the 1960s, can be distinguished by a small additional windows behind each of the side-doors. At launch the vehicle appeared as a boxy flat sided van with an advertised load volume of 7.45 m¬≥ which compared with 7.3 m¬≥ for the Citro√´n H as it appeared in the same year. The Renault‚Äôs 2,383cc petrol engine had originally been introduced in 1936 for the Renault Primaquatre; slightly downtuned for this application it offered . The dry weight of provided a maximum laden weight of . During 1947 a flatbed truck version appeared along with a bare chassis version enabling users to specify their own bespoke body variants from specialist truck-body builders. In July 1949, a heavy duty 1,400 kg version joined the range, and this was also the year when four-wheel drive became an advertised option. By 1952, Renault offered a more modern engine for economy minded buyers and a detuned version of the 1996 cc unit from the recently introduced Renault Fr√©gate was an option for the 1,000 kg model. In 1956 the vans received a name, now being branded as the Renault Voltigeur and the Renault Go√©lette.Gabriel Jeudy, Les camions de chez nous en couleurs, √©ditions E.T.A.I. The Go√©lette, with its weight limit, was now offered with the 2141 cc \\"√âtendard\\" engine, which featured the same 88mm bore as the 1996 cc but had an 88mm stroke. This engine was also developed for the Renault Fr√©gate, which during its earlier years had failed to win market acceptance mainly because it was underpowered. The output when the engine in the van was lower than that produced in the passenger car. For 1961 buyers could specify a diesel option. The 1816 cc diesel unit came from Indenor, a company established by Peugeot to specialise in the design and manufacture of diesel engines. This engine was offered in the Peugeot D4 since 1959. Although diesel powered vehicles were not popular in France, the lower fuel tax rate on diesel fuel made it attractive for buyers. From the middle of 1962, Renault substituted a 2720 cc diesel engine of their own construction producing . In 1959 Renault launched the Renault Estafette with a front-wheel drive layout which allowed for a lower floor and much improved space utilisation: the bulkier but in other respects comparable Renault Voltigeur was formally withdrawn in 1963. Production of the Renault Go√©lette continued until May 1965, when it was replaced by the Renault Super Go√©lette SG2 range of larger light trucks. R 2087 Military R 2087 truck version The military version of the vehicle was homologated as the R 2087. It came with even greater ground clearance than the standard vehicle and was built, featuring four-wheel drive, from 1952. A variety of vans, with or without extra side-windows, and truck variations was produced. The military ambulance version was produced until 1969, several years after Renault had stopped offering civilian versions of the van.

This effect was first observed in Ivan Pavlov's classical conditioning studies where the dogs would salivate less (conditioned response) when presented with the sound of the tuning fork (conditioned stimulus) in the distracting context of a passing truck (external stimulus). External inhibition is important for its main principle in classical conditioning where a conditioned response may decrease in magnitude after the external stimulus is introduced. This is especially advantageous for when trying to disassociate conditioned stimulus and responses. A practical example is where students who become anxious (conditioned response) upon standing in front of the class to give a presentation (conditioned stimulus) may feel less anxiety if their friends were sitting in front of the student presenting (external stimulus). The positive association of speaking to friends may distract the student from associating speaking to the entire class with anxiety. Extent of external inhibition The extent of external inhibition depends on several factors, including: *The intensity of the external stimulus ‚Äì the stronger the external stimulus, the greater the inhibition of the conditioned response. *The amount of time it takes to notice the external stimulus ‚Äì the shorter the time it takes for the subject to perceive the external stimulus, the stronger the effect will be on disrupting the conditioned response. *Strict control of the learning environment ‚Äì the presence of a distracting stimulus will lead to greater external inhibition when learning has occurred under tightly controlled conditions than when learning conditions are more variable. External inhibition in relation to disinhibition This same external stimulus can also lead to an increased response of a conditioned reaction, called disinhibition, when introduced after experimental extinction (when the conditioned response process is independent of the conditioned stimulus). During extinction, the subject has been unconditioned as to not show the conditioned response when presented by the paired conditioned stimulus. An example of disinhibition is where a rat that was conditioned to walk from point A to point B at the sound of the buzzer and then unconditioned, and introduced with a different stimulus, such as a blinking light, will again exhibit the conditioned reaction of walking to point B. The observed response of walking to point B after a blinking light stimulus will be relatively greater compared to the rat‚Äôs movement during the unconditioned phase (when the rat was not presented with either the buzzer or blinking light). Experimental studies \\"External Inhibition and Disinhibition Produced by Duplicate Stimuli\\", Wenger (1936) Wenger's 1936 study examined if the same external stimulus can be used to demonstrate both external inhibition and disinhibition and the relationship of the external stimulus to the intensity of external inhibition and disinhibition. Wenger conditioned participants with electro-dermal response (raising the foot to avoid the shock) to a red light using repeating presentations of a red light paired with a shock to the right foot. After the participants were conditioned, the extra stimulus of a tactual vibration to the left hand was introduced before the red light was shown in the absence of a shock stimulus. Following the principles of external inhibition, Wenger hypothesized that the after-effect of the tactual vibration would inhibit the conditioned response to the red light and lead to smaller movements of the foot to the red light. Disinhibition was tested after experimental extinction, where the red light was presented multiple times without any shock reinforcement. Following the principles of disinhibition, Wenger hypothesized that the tactual vibration will induce a greater reaction to the light stimuli when compared to the reactions from the external inhibition test. Both of Wenger's hypotheses were confirmed; Wenger observed that both external inhibition and disinhibition could be produced by the same external stimulus (tactual vibration). In addition, higher intensity of the external stimulus produced greater magnitudes of external inhibition and disinhibition however the functional strengths of externally inhibited and disinhibited responses were not considered decisive. \\"External Inhibition and Disinhibition in a Conditioned Operant Response\\", Gagne (1941) The 1941 study by Gagn√© attempted to identify the effect of two different external stimuli (buzzer, and scratching on the back of the starting box) on rats, while applied during acquisition and extinction, to identify the effect on the strength of the conditioned operant response. Five groups of rats were used, however the differences in the latent period were hypothesized to be observed in the following conditions if it existed in comparison to a control group that did not introduce any external stimuli, 1) buzzer on the first trial of acquisition, 2) scratch on the first trial of acquisition, 3) buzzer on the fourth trial of acquisition, 4) scratch on the fourth trial of acquisition, 5) buzzer on the fifth trial of extinction, and 6) scratch on the fifth trial of extinction. For each experimental procedure, the buzzer was sounded for four seconds and stopped for two seconds before the beginning of the next trial; the scratching continued until the rat turned around to face the back of the starting box. The buzzer can be interpreted to explain Pavlov's observations on external inhibition and disinhibition in a conditioned operant response and support B. F. Skinner's hypothesis of an \\"emotional effect\\". Skinner describes that an emotional effect is observed when a response fails to be reinforced, possibly leading to operant extinction, and also an emotional \\"reaction commonly spoken of as frustration or rage\\". Regarding the extra stimulus used, the buzzer has a \\"depressing effect\\" on all trials which decreased the response magnitude during extinction. An observed increase of response magnitude following the depression would be considered a \\"compensatory increase in the number of available responses\\". On the other hand, the buzzer can also be interpreted as an external stimulus that decreases the response magnitude (external inhibition), and produce an increased response magnitude on the next trial (disinhibition) after the effect of inhibition declines. This suggests that the buzzer weakens the conditioned response, but if it is repeatedly encountered, it serves to strengthen the conditioned response, thereby decreasing the latent period. The external scratching stimulus portrays external inhibition during acquisition (fourth trial of acquisition), and disinhibition during extinction (fifth trial of extinction). There was a significant increase in the recorded latent period (i.e., the time it took for the rat to move out of the starting box and pass a four-inch mark while walking towards the food box), and decline in the magnitude of the conditioned response since the rat took longer to reach the four inch point. The additional learned response of the rat turning to the front of the box in reaction to the scratching is an effect of external inhibition, which may have added to the latent time, but the results do not indicate what portion of the rat‚Äôs turn-around response made up the latent time. Shortened latent period on the fifth trial of extinction indicates an increased magnitude of response, and represents disinhibition, where the rat is not responding to the extra stimulus as much and increases the magnitude of the conditioned response (faster latent time). \\"Experimental Inhibition of the Conditioned Eyelid Reflex\\", Pennypacker (1964) In a study by Pennypacker (1964), a conditioned stimulus of a circular red light, an unconditioned stimulus of a puff of dry compressed air, and an external stimulus of a 1,000-cps tone were used to investigate external inhibition at the human level during different introduction intervals. Reflexive blinking was measured as the conditioned and unconditioned response. Each participant was first presented with two trials of the circular red light without reinforcement, and three trials of the puff of dry compressed air alone. Depending on the group, participants were presented with either 15, 30, or 60 paired conditioned stimulus ‚Äì unconditioned stimulus (CS-UCS) trials, a round of an external stimulus, another 15, 30, or 60 trials of CS-UCS trials, another round of an external stimulus, and then 5 CS-UCS trials. Pennypacker suggested that following the introduction of any novel stimuli, a period of excitation occurs between the conditioned stimulus (red light) and its conditioned response (blinking), called an induction period. Thus, if the external stimulus was presented earlier in the acquisition phase, the observed decline in blinking would be even less than if the external stimulus was presented later. Pennypacker also suggested that it may be possible that an external stimulus that was introduced too late to affect the conditioned stimulus may externally inhibit the unconditioned stimulus. However, the study failed to confirm the presence of induction immediately after the tone (external stimulus) was introduced, and there was no evidence that external stimulus had any effect on reflexive blinking when presented halfway through the interval, aside from isolated cases. He suggests that the difference between the induction effect observed in a preliminary study and the current study are due to the use of visual external stimulus during a preliminary study and presenting the external stimulus instead of the conditioned stimulus; compared to the use of an auditory external stimulus and presentation of the tone in addition to the conditioned stimulus. Another suggestion is that the external stimulus was not intense enough to produce an inductive effect. Through this study, Pennypacker confirmed the observation of external inhibition on the human level. External inhibition was especially observed when the tone (external stimulus) was introduced during the acquisition phase, which was the interval right after the paired CS-UCS trials. The conditioned response, blinking reflex, was observed to be in decline (inhibited) compared to the rate during conditioning.

The family later moved to Cardston, Alberta, Canada, where the young Linder began to ride young steers and unbroken horses for amusement. He and his brother, Warner, soon took to rodeoing. The first time he competed at the Calgary Stampede, Linder won both the Canadian championships for Saddle bronc and bareback bronc riding. He soon began to dominate the sport, becoming known as \\"King of the Cowboys\\" in the 1930s, winning the Canadian all-round championship 7 times, and the North American championship 5 times in a row. In 1936, Linder joined 60 other cowboys in staging a rodeo cowboy strike at the Boston Garden. This action led to the birth of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association. Later he was involved in the foundation of the Canadian Professional Rodeo Association. Following his retirement as a competing cowboy, Linder produced rodeo competitions, including one presented at Expo 67 in Montr√©al, Quebec. Linder became a member of the (American) National Cowboy Hall of Fame in 1980. He was inducted into the Rodeo Hall of Fame of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in 1955 when they opened their doors. He was made an honorary chief of the Blood Indians.

An electric light source was installed and supplied with electricity from a power plant in a nearby building. In the early 20th century, cracks began to appear in the tower as still seen today.  World War I  In 1915 the light source and the generator were transported to Russia. During Germany's occupation of Latvia, they installed an acetylene light source. During WWI, the lighthouse was shelled by artillery. The original lighthouse was patched up, but it had to be demolished in 1932.  Latvian independence (1918‚Äì1940)  In 1932, a temporary wooden tower, almost as high as the original, was built. The tower was finished in September 1934. A German optical device ‚Äì a tall, fixed belt lens ‚Äì was installed in the new wooden tower. The light source was a Swedish- made, acetylene device. Depending on the distance, the light was either green or white.

Wulfsohn was a newspaper, magazine, and freelance photographer specialising on portrait, education, health and gender issues. She was known for documenting various HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns. She died in 2011 from lung cancer. Early life Wulfsohn was born on 18 March in Rustenburg, North West, South Africa. She attended Rustenburg Primary and Kingsmead College in Johannesburg, but matriculated at Selly Park Convent. She attended Johannesburg College of Art, where she studied graphic fine art from 1995 to 1997. Career Wulfsohn started her professional career as darkroom assistant in 1979 and asking for a photographer position when the vacancy became available. At first, The star replied with the fact that they did not hire women photographers. Wulfsohn respond \\"It‚Äôs time you did\\" and finally got the job. She worked on her portrait for the ‚ÄòStar Women‚Äô section and ‚ÄòThe Women's Page'. After working for 4 years in The Star, she moved to STYLE magazine in 1983 and in 1986 she was appointed chief photographer for Leadership Magazine. On 14 March 1987, she went freelance and joined Afrapix as full member with Guy Tillim, Santu Mofokeng and Cedric Nunn.  Projects about Apartheid  The development of her political awareness started when she traveled to Europe in 1979 and was exposed to banned literature, Ernest Cole‚Äôs famous book House of Bondage. Wulfsohn became more intensely aware with social inequality when she was met with other photographers for a project called South Africa: The Cordoned Heart which documented black poverty in South Africa. She preferred to document how apartheid shaped the lives of the South African's citizen rather than violence and conflict which happened between protesters and the police in the town. One of her projects, which started in 1990, was called Malibongwe. She was also taking photos of South African women activists who worked hard to establish democracy in South Africa. Motivation to start these project was based on her experience in Afrafix These photographs form the Malibongwe, Let Us Praise the Women exhibition, curated by the Apartheid Museum to commemorate 50th anniversary of the Women's March in 1956 and were displayed in Johannesburg in 2006. In 1994, she was employed by the Independent Electoral Commission with Paul Weinberg, Henner Frankenfeld and Graeme Williams to document the first democratic general elections in South Africa. These photos were published in a book called An End to Waiting. Work with HIV/AIDS Starting in late 1987, Wulfsohn documented various HIV/AIDS awareness initiatives. This project was started because of a request from her cousin to give a face to AIDS in South Africa. Wulfsohn found that the Johannesburg Health Department established an HIV education play that was performed in clinics to increase condom use. The plays were performed by a group called the City Health Acting Troupe (CHAT). She documented the actor when they performed the play. The plays usually performed at waiting rooms and other public spaces, such as Joubert Park Clinic. Wulfsohn started this work in 1987 and end it at 1990. She worked with Gary Friedman in the Puppets against Aids project in Diepkloof Prison in 1996. In 1999‚Äì2000, while working for the Department of Health in Beyond Awareness campaign, she shot a series of photographs of 31 South Africans telling the public that they have HIV/AIDS. These photographs called \\"Living Openly\\" was published in newspapers and magazines around South Africa, and were displayed at the Durban International Aids Conference in July 2000. The \\"Living Openly\\" project was showing in a TV documentary which was broadcast four times in August 2000. This exhibition has been displayed at numerous centres and conferences, such as the Aids in Context Conference at University of the Witwatersrand in April 2001 and the Healing Through Creative Arts Conference at Museum Africa, in Johannesburg in November and December 2001. Wulfsohn's commitment to documenting the struggle against HIV and AIDS in South Africa continued over 20 years and was regarded as seminal. Other professional work She was hired by OXFAM UK and Frances Lincoln Publishers in 2000 to take the photographs for a children's counting book, called One Child, One Seed, set in rural KwaZulu Natal. After illustrating One Child, One Seed, she was asked by the same publisher to write and illustrate Bongani's Day ‚Äì A Day in the Life of a South African Child. Gisele worked with many national and international NGOs, including the Nelson Mandela Foundation, Mindset, NBI (National Business Initiative), and ActionAid UK. She also produced portraits of seven South African Constitutional Court Judges, which hang in the public art area of the Constitutional Court. A number of Wulfsohn's pictures were included in the 'Then and Now' publication, in which the work of eight South African photographers who worked during and after the apartheid era is highlighted. Six of her images are included in the 'Rise and Fall of Apartheid' exhibition. Her photographs also published on various publication all around the world, such as The Lancet , Mother Jones, The Economist, Marie Claire and Der Spiegel.

Pearson returned to England in August 1770 with Governor Harry Verelst, under whom he had acted as Military Secretary, and built a house for himself at Burton, in which he collected a very extensive library, consisting of works on the history, antiquities, topography, and heraldry of Great Britain and Ireland, foreign history, voyages and travels, natural history, etc., but it was principally remarkable for the large number of books in all branches of old English literature, and it was especially rich in the works of the early poets and dramatists. In 1776 Pearson again went to India, but after a residence there of five years he fell a victim to the effects of the climate, and died at Calcutta on 5 August 1781. Some years after his death his library was brought from Westmoreland, and sold on 14 April 1788, and twenty-two following days, by T. and J. Egerton at their auction room in Scotland Yard.

A child prodigy, she led one of the first successful all-female bands, and was the first trumpet player to give a recital at Carnegie Hall. Biography She was born in Stamford, Connecticut, and, with her father's support, began playing the cornet at the age of seven. She gave her first public performance at the age of nine. At 11, after an invitation from Frank Damrosch, she entered the Institute of Musical Art (later the Juilliard School) in New York City, where, under the instruction of Adolphe Dubois, she switched from the cornet to the trumpet.John Wallace and Alexander McGrattan, The Trumpet, Yale University Press, 2012 She graduated at the age of 14 in 1907.

Retrieved May 11, 2013 She recorded for several companies, including Columbia Records, for whom her quartet's recording of \\"Just a Baby's Prayer at Twilight (For Her Daddy Over There)\\" was successful in 1918. The following year she formed the Gloria Trumpeters, with two trumpets and two trombones, and during the 1920s toured on the Keith vaudeville circuit with B√©zazian. She featured works by George Antheil and Virgil Thomson, performed with the Manhattan Symphony Orchestra and the Rochester Park Band, and recorded both solo and with her group for both Edison Records and Columbia. One of her 1920 recordings for Edison, \\"The Debutante\\", is said to demonstrate \\"a command of the instrument and level of musicianship that would have enhanced the brass section of any symphony orchestra.\\" During the 1930s, she began to make regular appearances on radio, and also sang in musicals. In February 1949, she played the first ever solo trumpet recital in Carnegie Hall, at which she gave the inaugural performance of Virgil Thomson's At The Beach and Georges Enescu's L√©gende to great acclaim. She returned to Carnegie Hall to give her final recital, Farewell to My Trumpet, in 1957. In later years she wrote a manual on trumpet technique, and wrote several works for the trumpet, including Suite for Solo Trumpet and Symphony Orchestra (1980), which was recorded by Gaeton Berton with the Maryland Symphony Orchestra, and On Taming the Devil's Tongue (1982). She also wrote several books of poetry.

Geology Rampart Range The spring water of Manitou Springs originates from two sources. \\"Deep-seated waters\\" of Rampart Range and Ute Pass provide one source of mineral water. Water below the surface is run through cavernous drainage systems called karst aquifers. Limestone in the water dissolves and resulting carbonic acid, or carbon dioxide, make the water \\"effervescent\\". The water rises to the surface naturally. This process is an artesian process where as water rises through layers of rock it picks up minerals and soda, or sodium bicarbonate. Some of the spring water also comes from \\"surface\\" waters from the watershed basins of Fountain Creek and Williams Canyon. Each spring has a different mineral content and because of that, a different taste. History Navajo and Manitou springs, Colorado, from Robert N. Dennis collection of stereoscopic views Valley of springs where Ute came to hunt and take the mineral springs. The center of the photograph shows a \\"lone encampment\\" of Ute Native Americans, between 1874 and 1879. Soda spring, 1870 The town has several mineral springs, called manitou for the \\"breath of the Great Spirit Manitou\\" believed to have created the bubbles, or \\"effervescence\\", in the spring water. The springs were considered sacred grounds where Native Americans drank and soaked in the mineral water to replenish and heal themselves. Ute, Arapaho, Cheyenne and other plains tribes came to the area, spent winters there, and \\"share[d] in the gifts of the waters without worry of conflict.\\" There were 9 or 10 natural springs. As whites moved in there were \\"skirmishes\\" for access to the historical resort area until the Native Americans were removed from the area and placed on reservations. Explorer Stephen Harriman Long made note of the water's healing properties in 1820. His expedition's botanist and geologist, Edwin James, noted the healing benefits of the water; He was also the first European man believed to have climbed Pikes Peak. George Frederick Ruxton wrote of the \\"boiling waters\\" in a book about his travels. Recognizing the extent to which Native Americans considered the site to be sacred, Ruxton wrote: \\"‚Ä¶the basin of the spring (at Manitou) was filled with beads and wampum, and pieces of red cloth and knives, while the surrounding trees were hung with strips of deer skin, cloth and moccosons (sic).\\" Forty-eight years later, a plan for a health resort was developed by Dr. William Abraham Bell and William Jackson Palmer, a general during the Civil War: \\"They had a vision of dreamy summer villas nestled in the mountains, with grand hotels and landscaped parks clustered around the springs.\\" Railroad transportation brought people into the area, first called Fountain Colony and La Font. The town wasn't built at envisioned by the two men, storefronts and homes were built in the town. It became the first resort town in the state. In 1873 Henry McAllister, a developer working for Palmer, touted the medicinal benefits of the springs and that Manitou Springs had the necessary components of a successful spa resort, including \\"incomparable climate and scenery\\". Medical practitioners, such as Dr. Edwin Solly, promoted the health benefits of the \\"pure air\\" and sunny Rocky Mountain climate as the \\"world's best suited therapeutic environment\\" for the treatment of tuberculosis. He also believed in the benefits of mineral spring water which drew tourists and the infirm, particularly people with tuberculosis, to the area. Some springs were enclosed as the town grew. One of the enclosures, in red sandstone and under a \\"conical roofed structure\\", is the Cheyenne Spring House. There were more than 50 drilled wells and springs after the turn of the century. Since then, more were enclosed. After a period when the town's popularity diminished, some springs were closed, capped or paved over. Then the Mineral Springs Foundation was formed in 1987 to restore some of the springs and promote the benefits of the town's spring water.

Every 7 minutes a geyser erupted. In 1993 a park was developed surrounding a newly drilled spring. Don Green, Maxine Green, and Bill Burgess collaborated on two fonts at the spring. Cheyenne Spring House Cheyenne Spring House, near the Navajo Spring and the Spa, was built in the 1890s of red sandstone. It is a soda spring. Like the Navajo Spring, it has a high overall mineral content, but not a high content of any specific mineral. The building was constructed by the Manitou Mineral Water company. Its sweet water comes from limestone aquifers thought to be more than 20,000 years old and located about one mile below the surface. The spring's water is available to the public in the bronze sculpture by Paul Rogers that stands a few feet from the spring house. Iron Spring Geyser The Iron Spring Geyser was drilled on Ruxton Avenue in 1910 by Joseph Hiestand to increase the availability of iron-rich mineral water, also known as a chalybeate water, in the town. The spring water also contains a high content of fluoride, silica, sodium and potassium. In the 1880s \\"health seekers\\" stopped at the spring during their daily walk. Navajo Geyser Previously, the spring would erupt every 45 minutes and shoot up to 7 feet into the air. It was located in the Navajo Geyser Pavilion. The spring which is privately owned was restored in 2006, but ceased to flow in later years. There is now no sign of the Spring in the Manitou Outpost store building where the guide's photo displayed it. The spring was plugged and a sidewalk was paved over it. The spring was later renovated into the hand pump that exists today. Navajo Spring Native Americans and early settlers came to the Navajo Spring along the Ute Trail to take the water believed to have healing powers. Its water supplied the local bathhouse and was the source of the bottled spring water sold as \\"Ginger Champagne\\" and \\"Manitou Table Water\\". In general, the water has a high mineral content, but does not have an exceeding level of any particular minerals. The spring font, designed by Chris Dysart, is located behind the Patsy's popcorn kiosk on Manitou Avenue. Shoshone Spring Shoshone Spring's spring house, built in the 1890s, is located on Manitou Avenue. It has the \\"greatest amount of deep-seated water from the karst aquifer system and the highest mineral content of the town's springs, and particularly high content of chloride, calcium, alkalinity, lithium, manganese and zinc. Because of its high mineral content, it was considered the most \\"medicinal\\" of Manitou's springs, partly because of its sulphur content. The spring house was constructed of red sandstone from the nearby Kenmuir Quarry, which is now the Red Rock Canyon Open Space. Soda Spring Soda Spring is one of the natural springs in Manitou Springs and once in an open air pavilion, the spring is located now in the Spa building basement. Stratton Spring Stratton Spring, named for Winfield Scott Stratton, was drilled in 1936 by the Stratton Foundation. It is located at \\"the loop\\", a circular intersection at the end of Manitou Avenue, which was the end of the avenue's railroad car line in the early 20th century. A sculpture, created by Fred Darpino, is located at the site. Twin Spring Located on Ruxton Avenue, Twin Spring combines waters from two different depths and flow from one font. The spring was once called Twin Lithia Springs, as Lithium is present in the spring water at a concentration of .233 mg/l. The water, high in magnesium, is considered a \\"sweet\\" water, used by locals to make lemonade. Aside from the pleasing taste, it is also sought for its potassium and calcium content. The spring was drilled by William S. Crosby in the 1920s. Ute Chief Spring The spring, located at the far western end of Manitou Avenue, is a privately owned spring. A sculpture, created by Steve Titus, of a Native American man symbolizes the historic use of advertising sculptures established around town to promote bottled Ute Chief Mineral Water. The metal sculpture is a replica of the original plaster sculpture of the same design that was on the site in the first half of the twentieth century. The Ute Chief Spring no longer flows. Wheeler Spring The spring was drilled in 1920 by the son-in-law of Jerome B. Wheeler, an investor in Aspen and Manitou Springs, Colorado, creating the Manitou Mineral Water bottling plant and building the Wheeler Clock on Manitou Avenue. (He also built the Hotel Jerome in Aspen.) The spring is located near the location of his home, Windemere, which is where the United States Post Office is now located.

It is designated a Grade I listed building and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. The bar is located between North Bar Without and North Bar Within, close to Beverley St Mary's and abuts buildings on either side. Traffic is limited to single file through the bar arch and controlled by a set of lights. History \\"North Bar (without) Beverley.\\" A street scene in 1932 In the early medieval period, the town of Beverley was not walled. There are records indicating that Bars had been built in the 12th and 13th centuries, but North Bar is the only survivor. It was built in 1409 at a cost of ¬£97 and was renovated in the 17th century. In 1673 the bi-annual horse fair was held on the street within the bar and the bi-annual sheep fair in the street without the bar. In 1686 the annual cattle fair was moved to street within the bar and the sheep and horse fairs were moved to the street without the bar. The cattle fair was moved elsewhere in the town in 1865 and by 1959 all fairs had moved further afield. The bars also acted as toll gates, passage through them having to be paid for as a sort of local tax. For example, records (extract below) for the year 1420 in which King Henry V visited the town, demonstrate that North Bar was the principal route into the town by the amount of tolls collected. ¬£17- 4s. 8d. received for pavage at the North bar this year by John Fletcher and John Grimsby collectors as appears by their accounts. ¬£2. Is. 9^d. received by John Smyth the collector in Norwood for pavage this year as appears by his account examined and proved. 13s. 4d. received by William Read collector at Newbegin bar this year as appears &c.; 18s. 4d. received by Richard Batty collector at Keldgate bar for pavage as appears &c.; ¬£2. 2s. 9d. received by John Fayr collector at the river for pavage this year as appears &c.; There are records of the North Bar being used as viewing gallery for the town governors in the 15th and 16th centuries during the plays that occurred at the Corpus Christi festivals. In 1643, a year into the English Civil War, the mayor, the Rt Hon Manbie, ordered that North Bar, as well as Newbigin and Keldgate Bars, be locked by constables of those wards between the hours of nine at night and six in the morning. Layout The two storey structure is made of brick with buttresses on the North face either side of the archway. Above the centre point of the arch is a carved stone cartouche of a coat of arms. Either side of the carving are two recessed windows that have been filled in with brick. Above these is a recessed window. Before reaching the crenelated parapet, there is a course of brickwork marking the level. On the South face above the centre point of the arch is some protruding brickwork of three shields hanging from a line. These are located in between two recessed windows that have been bricked up and a third smaller bricked up window above. These are enclosed by a line of brickwork resembling gables. Above these are two modern rectangular windows. Before reaching the crenelated parapet, there is a course of brickwork marking the level. Inside the archway, the rib vaulting matches the dimensions of the arches and is built in two bays. There is a portcullis groove.

Around 1200, he composed the \\"Laubacher Barlaam\\", a Middle High German translation of a 12th- century Middle Latin version of the legend of Barlaam and Josaphat. His version is not to be confused with the verse romance Barlaam und Josaphat (c.1220) of Rudolf von Ems.Siegfried A. Schulz, \\"Two Christian Saints? The Barlaam and Josaphat Legend\\", India International Centre Quarterly 8, 2 (1981): 137. Otto was the son of Diepold II, Count of Berg-Schelklingen, and Gisela of the House of Andechs. His brothers Diepold, Manegold and Henry were also bishops. Otto was a canon at the cathedral of Magdeburg before his election as bishop. In 1189 he obtained juridical rights, market rights and Burgrecht in the possessions of his diocese in the Duchy of Austria. After the disputed imperial election of 1198, he initially sided with Philip of Swabia, but is later found in the following of Otto IV. In 1215 he paid homage to Frederick II. Otto's Barlaam is 16,500 lines of poetry, one third of which concerns the religious and baptismal instruction, usually in dialogue form, of Josaphat by Barlaam. Otto often compares Barlaam to Saint Anthony the Great for their shared asceticism. Josaphat gives long speeches to his angry father, the king, and to the people. The most interesting aspect to the modern reader is Otto's description of different religions: Chaldaean \\"astrology and occult arts\\", Greek anthropomorphism, Egyptian cults of plants and animals, and euhemerism. In this, he relies on earlier Christian writings, notably John of Damascus and perhaps also Lactantius (an influential Christian euhemerist).

F. Rotherham and built at NZR Addington between 1894 and 1903. They were amongst NZRs' longest lived tender engines. Origin and Design The U class was designed to fill a need to provide more powerful and faster passenger locomotives than the N and V classes then in service. The class were the first express locomotives on the NZR to have Walschaerts valve motion and also introduced the 4' 6\\" driving wheel which would be considered standard for express passenger work. They did however have flat slide valves and would be the last NZR locomotives so built. The U's were the first tender locomotives built in New Zealand and were a significant step in the country's industrial capability. However, Addington was not yet set up for mass production and construction was intermittent and drawn out, resulting in changes to the design over the course of building. The first pair had a curved running board that started high near the smokebox and curved over downward over the lead driver. The livery was black edged on the tender and cab with chocolate, and lined with a gold stripe. the boiler bands, steam dome casing and leading edge of the Belpaire firebox were polished brass and the wheels and frames were varnished. The second pair introduced the new standard cab but retained wooden headstocks. The third pair received steel headstocks. The final three were built with boilers of 175psi capacity. The last built, No. 378, had a sand dome and continuous brakes, features soon added to the rest. Service and Modifications Although reported to 'curve well and ride easily', and possessed of relatively large driving wheels, they were not a success on the Canterbury plains as intended. According to driver Jack Ewart: \\"... she [the U class] failed when the Canterbury Nor'wester was blowing and would not stand thrashing and consequently lost time.\\" They were soon replaced on these services by the Baldwin built UB class. Before World War One the class averaged 27,000 miles annually. Superheating was applied in the 1920s, followed by piston valves shortly afterwards. Between 1935 and 1940 the class received Waikato spark arrestors and tender cabs. Second sand domes and standard funnels were added around this time. By now the class were all stationed in Southland and performed branchline work in and around Invercargill, and were well regarded in these duties. The class as a whole survived into the 1950s and were withdrawn between 1954 and 1959. Some were dumped in rivers as erosion protection in Southland rivers. Preservation The remains of U194 the chassis is stored at Waitara at their Hooterville Heritage Charitable Trust depot, sadly after Hooterville owner Tony Bachelor was tricked by the infamous con-man Don Rea whom was later arrested, the society was forced to close, as of today the chasis is still in the undergrowth and it would be impossible to restore thus it would need new parts manufactured, the tender of 194 is stored at the Midland Rail Heritage Trust at Springfield which maybe used for one of the Uc's when restored in the future,  References   Bibliography   U class Category:4-6-0 locomotives Category:3 ft 6 in gauge locomotives of New Zealand Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1894 ","title":"NZR U class"},{"id":"39363574","text":"Events from the year 1940 in Scotland.

Born in 1945 in Chicago as Melvin McClelland, his career didn't begin with music; rather, in the Armed Forces. After spending a few years singing in Naval bands, he departed the Navy in the mid-1950s. From there, he went from stage to stage until the early 1970s, when in an attempt to boost his career prospects he visited a Queensbridge concert hall intending to use it for self- promotion. Whilst awaiting a meeting with the hall's owner, he encountered the mother of Herb Rooney and it emerged that he wanted a singer to record one of his compositions. After an informal discussion with Rooney himself, Bliss hit the studio to record it; the result was Reward. That song's B-side, \\"Synthetic Substitution\\", became one of the most sampled songs of all time. Unfortunately, Bliss' label, Sunburst Records, was a sister company of Opal Productions, and in 1974 it went bankrupt, taking Sunburst Records with it; in doing so rendering Bliss a one-hit wonder. In 2011, a documentary about him, Synthetic Substitution: The Life Story of Melvin Bliss, was released by Peripheral Enterprises. It was produced by Earl Holder.

Two-term incumbent Mayor Byron Brown, a Democrat, faced Republican challenger Sergio Rodriguez.  Background  The 2013 Buffalo mayoral race is notable as the first mayoral election in Buffalo's history to not feature any white, non-Hispanic candidates in either the primary or the general elections. A Buffalo News editorial noted that despite the historic racial aspect of the election, Buffalo voters that year tended to be more concerned with traditional issues such as crime and education, in sharp contrast to the deep ethnic divisions that have normally characterized city politics.  Candidates  =Democratic Party= Brown was challenged in the Democratic primary by Bernard Tolbert, the former Special Agent-in-Charge of Buffalo's FBI field office, the former Vice-President of Security for the National Basketball Association, and a former executive with the Coca-Cola Company. =Republican Party= Rodriguez, a 32-year-old, Dominican-born Marine Corps veteran, small business owner, and Medaille College administrator, ran unopposed as Buffalo's first Republican mayoral candidate since 2005. =Other potential candidates= Early in 2013, City Comptroller Mark Schroeder was rumored to be considering a campaign for mayor. However, he declined to run and later endorsed Brown. Local businessman Matthew Ricchiazzi was reported in June 2013 to be circulating petitions for a possible mayoral campaign. If a Ricchiazzi campaign had actually materialized, it would have touched off a rare Republican primary between him and Rodriguez. Debates Leading up to the primary elections on September 10, Brown, Tolbert and Rodriguez participated in three televised debates. The first mayoral debate took place on August 14, 2013 at the Buffalo News auditorium, sponsored by the Buffalo Association of Black Journalists and moderated by Al Vaughters of WIVB-TV. The dominant issue at the first debate was crime, with Rodriguez disputing Brown's assertion that crime has decreased in the city since the previous election; Brown rebutted by calling Rodriguez's statistics \\"absolutely false\\" and \\"nonsense\\". In addition, both Tolbert and Rodriguez claimed that Buffalo's police department is understaffed and inefficient, with Brown disputing Tolbert's specific claims that there has been a net loss in officers employed by the Buffalo Police since Brown's mayoral tenure began. Other issues that were debated included unemployment, with Brown forced to defend his administration in the face of statistics cited by Rodriguez showing that the unemployment rate in Buffalo rose from 6.3% to 10% during Brown's two terms as mayor, and low graduation rates in the Buffalo Public Schools, with Tolbert calling for more involvement by the mayor's office in the school system and Rodriguez going even further, favoring complete mayoral control of the school board as is the case in New York City and Yonkers, while Brown reaffirmed his commitment to cooperation with the Board of Education but denied he had the authority to directly participate in school-district policymaking. The second debate was held on August 22, 2013 at St. Mary's School for the Deaf, sponsored by the Parkside Community Association and moderated by Buffalo News reporter Brian Meyer, with questions fielded directly from the audience. The beleaguered state of the Buffalo Public Schools was the dominant topic in the second debate, with Tolbert elaborating on his earlier position regarding mayoral involvement in the school board by proposing that three of the nine school board members, as well as the school superintendent, be appointed directly by the mayor, while Rodriguez repeated his earlier call for direct mayoral control of the schools. Brown, for his part, touted his success in restoring music programs to Buffalo city schools as well as the hiring of more school security officers. In addition, the Brown administration's record on economic development was attacked by both challengers, with Brown's boasts of $1.7 billion in development projects currently underway in the city countered by Tolbert's criticism that Brown allowed the Buffalo Economic Renaissance Corporation to fold under his watch, as well as his characterization of economic development in Buffalo as concentrated in downtown at the expense of the neighborhoods. As well, Rodriguez cited statistics showing that Buffalo's employment base has been reduced by 10,000 people since Brown took office in 2006. The third and final mayoral debate was held on August 27, 2013 at WNED-TV studios. The candidates reiterated the points covered in the first two debates on police department staffing issues, unemployment, economic development, and problems in the Buffalo Public Schools. On the subject of crime, both Rodriguez and Tolbert derided Brown's use of gun buyback programs as a remedy for crime, with Tolbert characterizing the buybacks as \\"stunts\\". Also in the third debate, Tolbert was put on the defensive when he was asked about a sexual harassment lawsuit that had been filed against him while he was an executive at the National Basketball Association, while Brown was compelled to deny reports that his administration was rewarding campaign donors with patronage jobs as a quid pro quo and described a lawsuit filed against the city by a housing development company alleging a pay-to-play policy for awarding contracts as \\"baseless\\" and \\"absolute nonsense\\".  Democratic primary   Campaigning  Though praised for his experience in crimefighting and community service and his \\"straight-shooting vibe\\", Tolbert was criticized for waiting until relatively late in the election to announce his candidacy, spending many months courting potential backers and conspicuously attending community events as speculation grew, but not establishing a campaign finance committee until April 2 nor officially entering the race until May 11. In the run-up to the primary, a Siena College poll commissioned by the Buffalo News and WGRZ-TV and conducted between August 11 and 13, 2013 favored Brown to win the Democratic primary election against Tolbert by a margin of 61-32. According to a Buffalo News editorial published on August 17, though his fundraising prowess, his name recognition and the other benefits of incumbency, and the great progress in waterfront development that took place during his administration would have made any primary challenge difficult, Brown's especially formidable lead was described as first and foremost a product of the shortcomings of his opponent's campaign, an anemic one by a political novice whose muddled message has failed to resonate with voters, and particularly with the African-American community whose loyalty to Brown Tolbert had hoped to challenge. For his part, Tolbert accused Brown of pressuring city workers to donate to his campaign as a condition of continued employment as well as engaging in intimidation tactics against volunteers on opposing campaigns, the latter of which was echoed by Rodriguez. Despite an impressive performance by Tolbert in the three mayoral debates that frequently put Brown on the defensive, a subsequent Siena College poll taken three weeks after the aforementioned one showed that Brown had widened his lead over Tolbert by four points. Election returns The Democratic primary election was held on September 10, 2013. Brown won the election, earning 14,022 votes (68.1%) to Tolbert's 6,577 (31.9%). Commenting on Brown's official nomination the day after the election, a Buffalo News editorial reiterated the points made in the August 17 editorial regarding Brown's name recognition and the capital investments on the waterfront, also opining that the incumbent benefited from an electorate that largely believed Buffalo is heading in the right direction despite the problems facing the city school system, on which Tolbert tried and failed to capitalize. The editorial also mentioned the ample airtime on local television the Brown campaign purchased with its massive \\"fundraising war chest\\" for its commercial, which prominently featured President Barack Obama's praise of the sitting mayor during a visit to the University at Buffalo on August 22, 2013. Contrary to predictions, turnout in the primary was historically low, with roughly 20% of registered Democrats voting. This apathy was attributed variously to Brown's perceived invincibility given his overwhelming lead in the polls, or to a failure by both Brown and Tolbert to inspire enthusiasm among city voters.  Conservative primary  Campaigning In July 2013, under the terms of New York State's electoral fusion law, Rodriguez announced plans to mount a write- in candidacy as a Conservative to challenge that party's official endorsement of Brown, much as 2005 Republican candidate Kevin Helfer did, and also to circulate petitions for a possible independent run. Rodriguez was indeed able to collect the required number of valid signatures to run as a Conservative, but the Erie County Conservative Party, who had earlier endorsed Brown, vigorously sought to fend off Rodriguez's challenge by distributing a mailer to Conservative-registered city voters assailing Rodriguez for his support of the NY SAFE Act and his past unpaid student loans, a move Rodriguez described as \\"ugly, dirty, slanderous and baseless politics that people have grown to detest\\" employed in order \\"to deny voters a choice\\". The party also legally challenged all of the petitions collected by Rodriguez based on a little-known stipulation that the notaries public who distribute Opportunity To Ballot petitions must swear in the signers; this effort was dismissed by Erie County Supreme Court Justice John Michalek, setting the stage for a Conservative primary. Election returns The Conservative primary was held on September 10, 2013. Brown captured 70 of the votes cast, while Rodriguez captured 44 and Tolbert 11. Republican campaign Rodriguez officially announced his candidacy on February 6, 2013. His robust campaign featured an active social media presence and an emphasis on grassroots campaigning as exemplified by his \\"30 Day Every Neighborhood Tour\\" in September and October, which saw the candidate go door-to-door interacting with and fielding questions from residents of all parts of the city. Nonetheless, it was remarked in the Buffalo News that although Rodriguez has generated some buzz among Buffalo Hispanics, he has as yet failed to unite the city's Latino community in support of his long-shot candidacy. In addition to his pursuit of the Conservative line, Rodriguez's petitions for an independent run also bore fruit with his announcement on September 25 that he would be running on a new ballot line, dubbed the Progressive Party. The party's name and platform make direct reference to the Progressive or \\"Bull Moose\\" Party founded by Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, with a stated goal of reforming city government by transcending partisan divisions and \\"making governmental changes parallel with the changing needs of its people... with a dignity defined by moral strength and urgency\\".  Endorsements  Brown received the endorsement of the Erie County Democratic Party, and also of the Erie County Conservative, Working Families, and Independence parties. He was also endorsed by, among others, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, U.S. Senator Charles Schumer, U.S. Congressman Brian Higgins, New York State Senator Tim Kennedy, Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz, New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, New York State Assemblypeople Crystal Peoples-Stokes, Sean Ryan, and Michael Kearns (the latter of whom had been his primary challenger in the previous election), the Buffalo Niagara Partnership, and the Buffalo Niagara Association of Realtors. Tolbert, whose criticism of Brown in the months leading up to the Democratic primary largely centered on the incumbent mayor's crime-fighting efforts, received the endorsement of the Buffalo Police Benevolent Association in July 2013. Tolbert also received the endorsement of Challenger Community News, one of Buffalo's two African-American community newspapers. Rodriguez received the endorsement of the City of Buffalo Republican Committee. However, the Erie County Republican Party has declined to endorse Rodriguez, amid accusations from Rodriguez's camp that county Republican officials have pressured him to drop out of the race for fear that increased voter turnout in heavily Democratic Buffalo could be a detriment to Republican candidates for countywide office. Rodriguez also received the endorsement of \\"The Griffin\\", the Canisius College student paper.

Following the death of her father in the Charenton asylum in 1860, L√©on took Louis-Alphonse Hyrvoix, who was in charge of Emperor Napoleon III's security, as a lover. She gave birth to Alphonse L√©on, Hyrvoix's son, in Bordeaux on 5 February 1865. L√©on and Hyrvoix were lovers for eight years. L√©on Gambetta L√©on met Gambetta in 1868 and was his mistress from 1872 until his death a decade later. She lived in a house on Avenue Perrichont in Auteuil and was his confidante and adviser in his political plans. They corresponded on an almost daily basis and Gambetta repeatedly urged her to marry him. She finally consented in 1882. The couple had arranged to marry in December 1882. Shortly before the wedding day Gambetta accidentally shot himself in the hand while cleaning his gun. The wound refused to heal and he died of complications caused by the wound on 31 December. As they couple had agreed to keep their relationship away from the public eye, L√©on did not attend his funeral. She did mourn him privately and continued to mourn until her death in 1906. It was only after her death that the full details of their relationship became known to the public. Around 1920 rumours circulated that L√©on had been a German spy. L√©on and Gambetta exchanged 6,000 letters between 1872 and Gambetta's death in 1882. Around 1,100 of these are still in existence.

This page of the manuscript, dated 1224 AD, is made from paper, sized 24.8 cm wide and 33.2 cm long, and is decorated by opaque watercolor, ink, and gold detailing. It is visually split into three horizontal portions from the top of the page to the bottom; the top of the page is dominated by two lines of Arabic script, followed by the image and then five more lines of text in Arabic. The writing below the image is predominantly black with the exception of one line, which is written in red ink and is therefore highlighted to the viewer. The page is usually not on display. Experts believe that the image was made in Iraq, Northern Jazira or Baghdad. Its Middle Eastern origin is corroborated with the physician‚Äôs appearance. In the image, he is wearing a headscarf, his clothing is quite colorful and it is detailed with gold decorations. Additionally, the Arabic text is a further indication that this specific page was formed in a Middle Eastern context. In this digital representation, the page looks to be in great condition and has minimal wear and tear. Brief History of the Materia Medica The term Materia Medica refers to both a specific text and a genre of texts, a complication illustrated by the diverse history of the original book. Pedanius Dioscorides was a Greek physician, the word here used in the medieval sense, born in 40 A.D. who spent multiple years traveling with the Roman Emperor Nero‚Äôs army. During these travels, Dioscorides gathered herbal samples and collected knowledge on the practical health uses of plants, amassing notes on over one thousand medicinal substances. In 70 A.D., Dioscorides published De Materia Medica or ‚ÄúOn Medicinal Substances‚Äù in his native language, Greek. The Materia Medica detailed ‚Äúplant names, synonyms and illustrations; plant habitat and botanical descriptions; properties, actions and uses of the drug; negative side effects, if any; administration and dosage recommendations; directions on harvesting, preparation and storage of herbs or drugs; possible adulterations and how they're detected; and the veterinary uses of the drug or herb, if any.‚Äù The text was published in five volumes and was eventually translated into multiple languages, including Latin and Arabic. This text went on to serve as a central source for knowledge on herbs and similar medical substances. As it traveled to new areas and was handed down through different leaders and dynasties, it was modified, rearranged and added to with the knowledge of those places. Therefore, this page in this Materia Medica is not identical to the original by Dioscoride or other surviving copies. History of the specific object rabid dog, another page from the same manuscript In 1913, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, New York received the folio after a history of European ownership. As far as the records show, this page of the manuscript was first collected by F. R. Martin of Stockholm in 1910. F.R. Martin also originally possessed additional folios that came from other copies of Dioscorides‚Äô Materia Medica such as the image titled ‚ÄúMen Stepping on Grapes‚Äù which is now also at the MMA. The central folio page, ‚ÄúPhysician Preparing an Elixir,‚Äù was then moved to the care of Georges. J. Demotte in Paris until 1913 when it was officially acquired by the museum. Demotte was a Belgian-born Parisian art dealer of the late 19th to early 20th century who also gave many different art and archaeological finds to the Metropolitan Museum. Demotte has become known for his acquisition of the Islamic ‚ÄúBook of Kings‚Äù or the Shahnameh, which he sold page by page to different interested parties. The fact that this page is from a highly translated text, De Materia Medica, may distort some of our analysis due to the great changes a literary work undergoes during translation. As the Materia Medica became widely spread and translated into multiple languages, this page and others may have traveled with physicians or along trade routes to reach new destinations and communities. Therefore, this text, as illustrated by its aesthetic and geographical origins in the Middle East, could display a very different side of the Materia Medica genre. It is possible that this page was an addition, performed by Middle Eastern physicians, in the 13th century and did not exist as a part of the early Materia Medica‚Äôs during the time of Dioscoride. Additionally, though the original five-volume text was an assemblage of information, perhaps for the aim of practical instruction, this page seems to diverge from that initial focus. It is esthetically pleasing, apparently quite valuable as shown by the gold detailing, and overall, seems to have been a precious object as shown by the minimal wear and tear depicted on its page on the MMA website. Therefore, one can assume that at least this page was not a highly circulated text within the Middle Eastern community. Perhaps this text was kept among scholars and through this seclusion in academic society, remained in good condition. Context The physician is surrounded by multiple different tools, perhaps signifying the importance of such inventions during the time this manuscript page was created. The physician is sitting on a stool and is making an elixir in a medium-sized pot using a mixing tool. He is seated in front of a medieval contraption that could have been used for filtering or other processes. To the far left of the image, on the other side of the potential filtering tool, there is a large blue jug. The prominence of these tools, perhaps important to the physician‚Äôs preparation of the elixir, are highlighted by their placement and coloring on the page. Additionally, the depiction of the physician in this text could illustrate the place of physicians in society in the Middle East during this time period. As previously explained, this text could have been an object of Middle Eastern academic society. Physicians in the 13th century were highly respected members of society as they were viewed as learned men. They were taught in the intricacies of humoral theory and were charged with the health of many communities. The physician in this image, demonstrated by the elaborate coloring of his shirt and its implications for his high social class, could be the depiction of an ideal. This man could be a representation of the ‚Äúideal Middle Eastern 13th century physician,‚Äù a man of ingenuity with his tools, knowledge of plants and herbs, and high social status. Yet, internal to this interpretation is a contradiction as the high society physician would also not be found working in such an outdoor environment. This physician would instead be found in a more scholarly/academic environment for this time period as the physicians of the 13th century were more invested in humoral theory than in herbs and plants. Therefore, the \\"physician\\" in this text could represent the work of an herbalist of this time period as opposed to a physician. In this way, the page ‚ÄúPhysician Preparing an Elixir‚Äù may display not only the great herbal and medical knowledge dating back to Dioscoride‚Äôs trips with Nero, but also the changing depiction of medical and societal ideals, all found within the same, diverse manuscript.

It is in the parish of Holme Valley and the metropolitan borough of Kirklees. Although it started as a fairly small hamlet it has grown considerably throughout the 1980s and 1990s with new housing. History School The first school opened in 1882 in the Sunday School, not moving to the current building until the early 1900s. The present school, Hade Edge Junior and Infant and Nursery School, is coeducational and has four classes. Shops There was a Co-op store on the corner of Greave Road and Dunford road which closed in the 1950s. A fish and chip shop at the top of Greave road closed soon after. A grocery store and post office was the last to close in 1989. A sweet shop was operated from a private house opposite the band room, a focus for village children after school. Church There was a church in Magnum that was demolished in the 1950s, along with most of the other buildings. The village is in the Parish of Holy Trinity, Holmfirth and there is a Methodist Church on Dunford Road. Public Houses At the peak there were 8 pubs in the area serving the many quarry workers, long gone pubs now demolished, or turned into residences, included the Sportsman, Roundclose, Junction, Weathercock and Moorcock Inns and the Road End Pub. Quarrying By 1861 Magnum Bonum Quarry employed over 60 people producing stone blocks for buildings and stone flagstones for railway station platforms. A hamlet of workers homes developed with a church and public house. Other quarries were Sans Pareil and Ne Plus Ultra. The nearest registered common land is Magnum Bonum, about half a mile south of the village. Hade Edge Brass Band The band was formed in July 1908 by some members of the Sunday School committee using second hand instruments from a former district band, the Old Moss Band. Various fund raising activities meant that many new instruments had been purchased by the time that the band won its first prize at Stalybridge in 1914. The band has gone from strength to strength and the current bandroom was opened in June 2007. The band was sponsored in the 1990s by Edgar Dickinson, one of the two brothers that started the Longley Farm dairy company in the village in 1948. Football The earliest records show that Hade Edge had a team in the Holmfirth and District Association Football League in the 1909/10 season. Currently Hade Edge AFC play at their ground off Dunford Road. They have senior teams in the Huddersfield and District Saturday League along with junior teams and training.

The name is from the \\"Flashing\\" (on Somali bal-bal be derived) from the nearby lighthouse. The suburb has formed since 1966 when access to the city was restricted. At first a shantytown, it is now a suburb with schools and a hospital, and a population estimated at 80,000. History After riots in 1966 a checkpoint was erected in front of the capital of the former French colony to discourage \\"subversive elements\\" at the entrance to the city. Upstream of this checkpoint developed a settlement of migrants from other parts of the country, an informal cattle market and a caravan station. Police raids in the city and the subsequent deportation of unwanted newcomers further contributed to the growth of Balbala, which became a large shantytown. After the independence of Djibouti in 1977, the checkpoint was lifted and Balbala formally transformed into a residential area and integrated into the urban development of Djibouti. Since 1987, it has officially been part of the city. In the first decade after independence, the population of Balbala had tripled again. It then became a new urban district, from the rural exodus. Building rights were gradually transferred to the occupants, and the area acquired urban characteristics, with solid construction and schools and other services. As of (2000) Balbala had four primary schools and the second largest hospital in the country, and its reputation had improved. The population was then estimated at 80,000. Despite this, much of Balbala remains an area of extreme poverty, with over 80% of the housing composed of corrugated sheeting, planks and metal panels. There is limited access to piped water and electrical power. Infant mortality rates are high.

He was commonly known as Johnstone the Smuggler or the Hampshire Smuggler. Writing in 1823, biographer John Brown described Johnstone as a real-life Rob Roy. Biography Johnstone was born near Lymington in 1772. Lymington had a long history of smuggling, beginning with the surreptitious transport of wool to the continent in the 17th century to evade high excise taxes. In 1724 Daniel Defoe wrote of the town: \\"I do not find they have any foreign commerce, except it be what we call smuggling and roguing; which I may say, is the reigning commerce of all this part of the English coast, from the mouth of the Thames to the Land's End in Cornwall.\\" Johnstone's father was a fisherman and smuggler and began taking his son to sea from the age of 9. By the age of 12, when his father died, Johnstone was an accomplished mariner and his familiarity with the English Channel and the coastal waters from Cornwall to Suffolk made him a much sought-after maritime pilot. Johnstone began smuggling aged 15, fought against the French in the Napoleonic Wars as a privateer, operated as a British double agent and led teams of divers to plant explosives on enemy shipping and fortifications. He also commanded both HMC Fox (a Revenue Cutter) and the first practical submarine, Nautilus. In 1798 he was imprisoned at the New Prison in Clerkenwell, London, for smuggling but escaped soon after. Further periods of imprisonment followed in France, Holland, and Fleet debtors' prison. Johnstone managed to escape confinement on each occasion and the 1823 publication The Historical Gallery of Criminal Portraitures, Foreign and Domestic reported: \\"No prison has yet been found strong enough to hold him.\\" In 1820, Johnstone was allegedly recruited by French agents to rescue Napoleon Bonaparte from St. Helena. The operation involved using a submarine to pick up Napoleon from near the shore and then transferring him to a waiting sail boat for onward transport to the United States. Napoleon died before the plan was put into effect.

It is a complex social behaviour in vertebrates associated with animal mating systems, life history traits, and ecology. Paternal care may be provided in concert with the mother (biparental care) or, more rarely, by the male alone (so called exclusive paternal care). The provision of care, by either males or females, is presumed to increase growth rates, quality, and/or survival of young, and hence ultimately increase the inclusive fitness of parents. In a variety of vertebrate species (e.g., about 80% of birds and about 6% of mammals), both males and females invest heavily in their offspring. Many of these biparental species are socially monogamous, so individuals remain with their mate for at least one breeding season. Exclusive paternal care has evolved multiple times in a variety of organisms, including invertebrates, fishes, and amphibians.  Mammals  Male mammals may invest heavily in reproduction through efforts to enhance reproductive success (e.g., courtship displays, intrasexual combat) or to provide paternal care. However, the costs of paternal care have rarely been studied in mammals, in large part because only 5-10% of mammals exhibit such care.Kleiman DG, Malcolm JR. 1981. The evolution of male parental investment in mammals. Pp 347-387 in Parental Care in Mammals, Gubernick DJ, Klopfer PH, eds. Plenum Press, New York. Nonetheless, in those species in which males do provide extensive care for their offspring (i.e., biparental species, including humans), indirect evidence suggests that its costs can be substantial. For example, mammalian fathers that care for their young may undergo systematic changes in body mass and in circulating or excreted concentrations of a number of hormones (e.g., androgens, glucocorticoids, leptin) as a function of reproductive status, and several of these hormones have important effects on body composition, metabolism, and organismal performance. Nonetheless, the energetic and performance consequences of male parental investment have rarely been investigated directly in mammals. In mammals, paternal care is found most commonly in primates, rodents and canids.  Humans  Human cultures and societies vary widely in the expression of paternal care. Some cultures recognize paternal care via celebration of Father's Day. According to CARTA , human paternal care is a derived characteristic (evolved in humans or our recent ancestors) and one of the defining characteristics of Homo sapiens. Different aspects of human paternal care (direct, indirect, fostering social or moral development) may have evolved at different points in our history, and together they form a unique suite of behaviors as compared with the great apes. One study of humans has found evidence suggesting a possible evolutionary trade-off between mating success and parenting involvement; specifically, fathers with smaller testes tend to be more involved in care of their children. Research on the effects of paternal care on human happiness have yielded conflicting results. However, one recent study concluded that fathers generally report higher levels of happiness, positive emotion, and meaning in life as compared with non-fathers. According to the United States Census Bureau, approximately one third of children in the U.S. grow up without their biological father in their home. Numerous studies have documented negative consequences of being raised in a home that lacks a father, including increased likelihood of living in poverty, having behavioral problems, committing crimes, spending time in prison, abusing drugs or alcohol, becoming obese, and dropping out of school.http://blog.fatherhood.org/bid/190202/The- Father-Absence-Crisis-in-America-Infographic Accessed 17 December 2013  Non- human primates  In non-human primates, paternal investment is often dependent on the type of mating system exhibited by each species. Mating systems influence paternity certainty and the likelihood that a male is providing care towards his own biological offspring. Paternal certainty is high in monogamous pair-bonded species and males are less likely to be at risk for caring for unrelated offspring and not contributing to their own fitness. In contrast, polygamous primate societies create paternity uncertainty and males are more at risk of providing care for unrelated offspring and compromising their own fitness. Paternal care by male non-human primates motivated by biological paternity utilize past mating history and phenotypic matching in order to recognize their own offspring. Comparing male care efforts exhibited by the same species can provide insight on the significant relationship between paternity certainty and the amount of paternal care exhibited by a male. For example, Siamangs (Symphalangus syndactylus) utilize both polyandrous and monogamous mating systems but, it was found that monogamous males are more likely to carry infants and contribute to parental duties compared to those in promiscuous mating systems. Studies in Primatology have used primate mating systems and social organization to help theorize the evolutionary significance of paternal care in Primates.  Strepsirrhines  Ring tailed Lemur Strepsirrhini is a suborder of the order Primates and includes lemurs, lorises, and bush babies. In this sub-order, males exhibit the lowest levels of paternal care for infants among primates. Examples of observed male care in this group include playing, grooming, and occasionally transporting infants. Males have also been observed interacting with infants while mothers park them and temporarily leave in order to feed. When female strepsirrhines park or nest their infants in nearby trees, males frequently use this as an opportunity to play with the unattended infants. In this suborder, male care and affection is directed toward multiple infants including non-biological offspring, and young strepsirrhines can be found interacting with various males. Paternal care does not influence infant growth rates or shorten inter-birth intervals of mothers as it can in haplorrhines. Strepsirrhini males exhibit the lowest intensity of care towards infants in non-human primates. Strepsirrhines are constrained by their life history traits and reproductive rates are not flexible within this group of primates. This group of primates are programmed to give birth when food is abundant resulting in strict seasonal breeding periods. Shortening inter-birth intervals, which is theorized to be a possible outcome of increased male care, is not beneficial for Strepsirrhine mothers and can decrease infant survival. Studies also show that paternity can be highly skewed in Strepsirrhines, with only one or few male members being the only biological father within a single group. Instead of relying on a singular paternal figure, female mothers in this group rely on alloparenting from other group members. Infant parking and strict reproductive schedules are more beneficial for successful infant development in Strepsirrhines.  Haplorrhines  Chimpanzee infant Haplorhini, a sub-order of the order Primate, includes tarsiers, New World Monkeys, Old World monkeys, apes, and humans. Haplorrhini is broken into two sister groups which are commonly distinguished by the characteristic of the primate nose: Catarrhini (narrow turned down nose) and Platyrrhini (flat nose). Paternal care is highly variable between the two sister groups and the species within them. = Catarrhines = Catarrhini is composed of Old World Monkeys (Cercopithecidae) and Apes (Hylobatidae and Hominoidea). These primates are geographically located in Africa, Asia, and Madagascar. Cercopithecines, the largest primate family, include primates species such as baboons, macaques, colobus, and vervet monkeys. Apes consist of species of gibbons, siamangs, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and humans. Catarrhines (non-human) are often organized into a multimale-multifemale social systems and utilize polygamous mating systems which results in paternity uncertainty. It is predicted that males in promiscuous mating systems do not engage in infant care due to the high costs of caring for an infant and missing opportunities to mate with receptive females. Male care in this group of primates is often portrayed through actions such as grooming, carrying, tolerance of the infant, as well as protection against agonistic interactions and infanticide. High ranking males can also provide access to food for developing infants. Direct care such as grooming and playing is not as common compared to male intervention on behalf of the infant when it is being harassed by conspecifics. Baboon and her infant In Cercopiths, male involvement in the infant's interactions with others is common in many species of baboons but between species paternal care is not always biased towards biological offspring. Male Savannah baboons (Papio cynocephalus) direct care towards their own biological offspring. Males in this species are more likely to intervene and protect infants from harassment against other group members when the infant is predicted to be their own. Studies have shown that male Savannah baboons selectively choose to remain in closer proximity to their own offspring and engage in long-term investment beyond early infancy, when the infant is at greatest risk for infanticide. Infants receiving paternal investment in Savannah baboons have shown enhanced fitness and accelerated maturation through males creating a safe zone for infants to exist in. Similarly to Savannah Baboons, Yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus) males provide elevated care for their own offspring. Long-term care and investment beyond early infancy is better linked to paternity in this species and affecting infant growth and development. Male baboons also direct care towards unrelated offspring based on male affiliations with female mothers. Baboon males and females within a social group often exhibit ‚Äúfriendships‚Äù with females which begin during birth of her infant and has been observed to end abruptly if the infant dies. Males establish associations with females in which they have previously mated resulting in affiliative behaviour and protection towards her offspring. Relationships created by male and female members are significant for infant survival in Chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) because the risk of infanticide in early infancy is higher in this species. Paternal care in the form of protection for the infant is therefore more beneficial than long term investment in Chacma baboons and is believed to be directed towards both biological and non-biological infants in the group. Rhesus Macaque Similarly to baboons, paternal roles and the underlying mechanisms as to why paternal care evolved vary within macaque species. In Sulawesi crested macaques (Macaca nigra) both male rank and the relationship to the mother predicted male care towards an infant instead of true biological paternity. In both Sulawesi and Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) males adopted a ‚Äúcare-then-mate‚Äù strategy, in which care is provided to infants regardless of paternity in order for the male to increase future mating opportunities with the mother. In both species, it was observed that male macaques are more likely to initiate care towards and positively interact with the infant in the presence of the mother. In Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis) biological paternity was the most significant predictor of male affiliations with infants and therefore males biased care towards infants presumed to be their own. Observers found that Assamese males were more likely to engage and provide care for infants in the absence of their mothers reducing the likelihood that care provided to infants will impress the mother and secure access to mating possibilities. In Rhesus macaques, male's providing protection and greater access to food resulted in higher weight gain for both male and female infants. This had a positive effect on infant survival and was significant in the first year of infancy when the risk of infanticide is the highest. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are organized into fission-fusion social groups and provide an example of a polygamous mating society. Male chimpanzees often engage with infants in the form of grooming, playing, and providing protection towards other group members. In both Western and Eastern chimpanzees it was found that males were more likely to engage with their own biological offspring meaning that male care is directed by paternity in this species. In both chimpanzee and bonobo social groups, high ranking alpha males sire approximately half of the offspring within their social group. More research needs to be done addressing how reproductive skew affects paternal care and infant-male relationships in non-human primates including chimpanzees and bonobos. = Platyrrhines = Titi Monkey Platyrrhini is a sub-order of the order Primate and are commonly referred to as the New World Monkeys. These primates occupy Central and South America, and Mexico. This group is broken into five families, range in body size, and include species such as spider monkeys, capuchins, and howler monkeys. Among primate species, the highest levels of male care found in New World monkeys are observed in Owl monkeys (Aotus azarai ) and Titi monkeys (Callicebus caligatus). In both of these species, males and females are monogamous, pair- bonded, and exhibit bi-parental care for their offspring. The social group in both these species consists of female and male parents along with their offspring. Males in these species serve as the primary caregivers and play a major role in infant survival. Male Titi monkeys are more involved than the mother in all aspects of male care except nursing, and engage in more social activities such as grooming, food sharing, play, and transportation of the infant. The bond between an infant and its father is established right after birth and maintained into adolescence making the father the infant's predominant attachment figure. Similarly, the male Owl monkey acts as the main caregiver and is crucial to the survival of his offspring. If a female gives birth to twins, the male is still responsible for transporting both the infants. In the absence of a father, infant mortality increases in both these species and it is unlikely that the infant will survive. One study found that the replacement of a male enacting as the role of the father resulted in higher mortality during infancy emphasizing the importance of the social bond created between father and offspring at birth. White-faced Capuchin In White‚Äêfaced Capuchins (Cebus capucinus) one study found that paternal care exhibited in the form of playful behaviour, proximity to, inspection of, and collecting discarded food items from infants was determined by male rank and dominance status rather than biological relatedness to the infant. Scientists believe that future research on kin recognition needs to be done on capuchins to determine if males choose to bias their care as well as in other non-human primates relying on phenotypic matching to distinguish biological offspring.  Evolutionary Perspectives on Paternal Care in Primates  Squirrel monkeys The Theory of Paternal Investment: Differences in infant care between sexes stems from females investing more time and energy in their offspring than males, while males compete with one another for access to females. Although paternal care is rare among mammalians, males across many primate species still play a paternal role in infant care.  The rise of paternity in several primate species can be explained by 3 different hypotheses  The Paternal Care hypothesis: Paternal care and investment will be designated to biological offspring, increasing the infant's chance of survival, and therefore increasing the male's own fitness. This hypothesis requires the on male to use recognition and behavioural cues to distinguish their own offspring from other infants. Paternal uncertainty is high in multimale- multifemale primate groups so males must use these cues to recognize and bias care towards their own offspring. This allows males to provide both short and long-term investment for infants. Primates living in monogamous pairs or single-male groups exhibit high paternity certainty and assist with the Paternal Care hypothesis. The Mating Effort hypothesis: Males provide care for infants in order to increase mating opportunities with females. This means that males are more likely to engage in affiliative behaviours with the infant in the presence of the mother as a form of male mating effort in order to enhance future reproductive success. This theory is independent of genetics and evolved independent of paternity. The Maternal Relief hypothesis: Males provide care infants to help reduce reproductive burdens of the female, ultimately resulting shorter inter-birth intervals and more successful offspring. This stems from the male alleviating the female from her parental duties in order to keep her resources from becoming depleted and subsequently allowing her to produce high quality milk for the infant. Similarly to the mating effort hypothesis, the maternal relief hypothesis is independent of genetics and does not require the male to be the biological father to take part in infant care.  Rodents  California mice (Peromyscus californicus) are well known for have intensive and sustained paternal behavior. Several species of rodents have been studied as models of paternal care, including prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster), Campbell's dwarf hamster, the Mongolian gerbil, and the African striped mouse. The California mouse (Peromyscus californicus) is a monogamous rodent that exhibits extensive and essential paternal care, and hence has been studied as a model organism for this phenomenon. One study of this species found that fathers had larger hindlimb muscles than did non-breeding males. Quantitative genetic analysis has identified several genomic regions that affect paternal care.  Birds  Fathers contribute equally with mothers to the care of offspring in as many as 90% of bird species, sometimes including incubating the eggs. Most paternal care is associated with biparental care in socially monogamous mating systems (about 81% of species), but in approximately 1% of species, fathers provide all care after eggs are laid. The unusually high incidence of paternal care in birds compared to other vertebrate taxa is often assumed to stem from the extensive resource requirements for production of flight-capable offspring. By contrast, in bats (the other extant flying vertebrate lineage), care of offspring is provided by females (although males may help guard pups in some species). In contrast to the large clutch sizes found in many bird species with biparental care, bats typically produce single offspring, which may be a limitation related to lack of male help. It has been suggested, though not without controversy, that paternal care is the ancestral form of parental care in birds.  Amphibians  Paternal care occurs in a number of species of anuran amphibians, including glass frogs.  Fish  According to the Encyclopedia of Fish Physiology: From Genome to Environment: > About 30% of the 500 known fish families show some form of parental care, > and most often (78% of the time) care is provided by only one parent > (usually the male). Male care (50%) is much more common than female care > (30%) with biparental care accounting for about 20%, although a more recent > comparative analysis suggests that male care may be more common (84%). There are three common theoretical explanations for the high levels of paternal care in fish, with the third one currently favoured. First, external fertilization protects against paternity loss; however, sneaker tactics and strong sperm competition have evolved many times. Second, the earlier release of eggs than sperm gives females an opportunity to flee; however, in many paternal care species, eggs and sperm are released simultaneously. Third, if a male is already protecting a valuable spawning territory in order to attract females, defending young adds minimal parental investment, giving males a lower relative cost of parental care. One well-known example of paternal care is in seahorses, where males brood the eggs in a brood pouch until they are ready to hatch. Males from the Centrarchidae (sunfish) family exhibit paternal parental care of their eggs and fry through a variety of behaviors such as nest guarding and nest fanning (aerating eggs). In jawfish, the female lays the eggs and the male then takes them in his mouth. A male can have up to 400 eggs in his mouth at one time. The male can't feed while he hosts the young, but as the young get older, they spend more time out of the mouth. This is sometimes termed mouthbrooding. During the breeding season, male three-spined sticklebacks defend nesting territories. Males attract females to spawn in their nests and defend their breeding territory from intruders and predators. After spawning, the female leaves the male's territory and the male is solely responsible for the care of the eggs. During the ~6-day incubation period, the male 'fans' (oxygenates) the eggs, removes rotten eggs and debris, and defends the territory. Even after embryos hatch, father sticklebacks continue to tend their newly hatched offspring for ~7 days, chasing and retrieving fry that stray from the nest and spitting them back into the nest.  Arthropods  Paternal care is rare in arthropods, but occurs in some species, including the giant water bug and the arachnid Iporangaia pustulosa, a harvestman. In several species of crustaceans, males provide care of offspring by building and defending burrows or other nest sites. Exclusive paternal care, where males provide the sole investment after egg-laying, is the rarest form, and is known in only 13 taxa: giant water bugs, sea spiders, two genera of leaf- footed bugs, two genera of assassin bugs, three genera of phlaeothripid thrips, three genera of harvestmen, and in millipedes of the family Andrognathidae.  Theoretical models of the evolution of paternal care  Mathematical models related to the prisoner's dilemma suggest that when female reproductive costs are higher than male reproductive costs, males cooperate with females even when they do not reciprocate. In this view, paternal care is an evolutionary achievement that compensates for the higher energy demands that reproduction typically involves for mothers. Other models suggest that basic life-history differences between males and females are adequate to explain the evolutionary origins of maternal, paternal, and bi-parental care. Specifically, paternal care is more likely if male adult mortality is high, and maternal care is more likely to evolve if female adult mortality is high. Basic life-history differences between the sexes can also cause evolutionary transitions among different sex-specific patterns of parental care.  Consequences for offspring survival and development  Care by fathers can have important consequences for survival and development of offspring in both humans and other species. Mechanisms underlying such effects may include protecting offspring from predators or environmental extremes (e.g., heat or cold), feeding them or, in some species, direct teaching of skills. Moreover, some studies indicate a potential epigenetic germline inheritance of paternal effects. The effects of paternal care on offspring can be studied in various ways. One way is to compare species that vary in the degree of paternal care. For example, an extended duration of paternal care occurs in the gentoo penguin, as compared with other Pygoscelis species. It was found that their fledging period, the time between a chick's first trip to sea and its absolute independence from the group, was longer than other penguins of the same genus. The authors hypothesized that this was because it allowed chicks to better develop their foraging skills before becoming completely independent from their parents. By doing so, a chick may have a higher chance of survival and increase the population's overall fitness.  Proximate mechanisms  The proximate mechanisms of paternal care are not well understood for any organism. In vertebrates, at the level of hormonal control, vasopressin apparently underlies the neurochemical basis of paternal care; prolactin and testosterone may also be involved. As with other behaviors that affect Darwinian fitness, reward pathways in the brain may reinforce the expression of paternal care and may be involved in the formation of attachment bonds. The mechanisms that underlie the onset of parental behaviors in female mammals have been characterized in a variety of species. In mammals, females undergo endocrine changes during gestation and lactation that \\"prime\\" mothers to respond maternally towards their offspring. Paternal males do not undergo these same hormonal changes and so the proximate causes of the onset of parental behaviors must differ from those in females. There is little consensus regarding the processes by which mammalian males begin to express parental behaviors. In humans, evidence ties oxytocin to sensitive care-giving in both women and men, and with affectionate infant contact in women and stimulatory infant contact in men. In contrast, testosterone decreases in men who become involved fathers and testosterone may interfere with aspects of paternal care. Placentophagia (the behavior of ingesting the afterbirth after parturition) has been proposed to have physiological consequences that could facilitate a male's responsiveness to offspring Non-genomic transmission of paternal behavior from fathers to their sons has been reported to occur in laboratory studies of the biparental California mouse, but whether this involves (epigenetic) modifications or other mechanisms is not yet known.

It follows Brian and Stewie as they head off to Vegas using a teleporting machine, which malfunctions and creates clones of themselves. The episode, which is the seventh in the series of Road to... episodes, originally aired on Fox in the United States on May 19, 2013, airing before the episode \\"No Country Club for Old Men\\". Together, the two episodes were promoted as being the season finale. First announced at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, the episode was written by Steve Callaghan and directed by Greg Colton. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics upon release. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 5.28 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances from Alexandra Breckenridge, Ralph Garman, Gary Janetti, Joe Lomonaco, Patrick Meighan, Emily Osment, Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin, and John Viener. Plot At the Quahog Gay Pride Day festivities, in a raffle sponsored by Weenie and the Butt, Brian wins tickets to see Celine Dion in Las Vegas. As they prepare to travel, Stewie convinces Brian to use the new teleportation device he has been working on instead. Stewie's device appears to have malfunctioned, and he believes it failed to work when it instead created a duplicate set of Brian and Stewie which was teleported to Vegas. The original Brian and Stewie then travel by plane to Vegas. As the duplicated pair check into the Bellagio hotel, their luck makes itself present immediately with the duplicated Brian winning a large jackpot at the slot machines near the entrance. The original Brian and Stewie arrive to find their room has been already taken. As the duplicated pair have the time of their lives, the original pair find themselves in a third-rate hotel. Trying their luck, they quickly lose all of the money they brought. The original Brian is ready to go home but Stewie admits that he already gambled away their return tickets. Brian admits that he cannot call for help after taking money from Lois. Using money they got from a loan shark, they bet on a basketball game and lose yet again. Preparing to leave, the duplicated pair sitting nearby accidentally take the empty backpack from the unlucky pair, while the original Stewie unknowingly takes the duplicated pair's backpack, which is full of money. As the pairs go their separate ways, an enforcer for the loan shark catches up with the duplicated pair (misidentifying the clones as the originals) to get the money back and they discover they have no cash. The enforcer orders Brian to decide whether he kills him or Stewie. Brian initially refuses to choose but when he panics, he tells the enforcer to shoot Stewie in the head, killing him, then the enforcer tells Brian to give him the money that he and Stewie borrowed or he dies next and leaves the room. Meanwhile, the original pair worry about getting caught. Stewie suggests that they make a run for it and head home, but Brian fears it will endanger the family. Stewie suggests that perhaps they should kill themselves and Brian reluctantly agrees. They prepare to throw themselves off the top balcony of the hotel but Stewie chickens out at the last second, leaving Brian to fall to his death. A panic-stricken Stewie trips over his backpack and finds the money the other pair had won. Returning home the next day, the duplicated Brian and original Stewie bump into each other at the bus terminal. Stewie realizes that the device had made clones of themselves. After deceiving each other about how their respective friend's deaths transpired to spare each other's feelings, the unlucky Stewie, realizing that the money was the lucky Brian's, hides it away from him to stop him from getting greedy and allow himself to return Lois' stolen money back to her. The two then return home while the duplicated Stewie and original Brian greet each other coldly at the pearly gates of Heaven. Production and development Steve Callaghan wrote the episode. \\"Roads to Vegas\\" is the seventh episode of the series' Road to.. hallmark which air through various seasons of the show. The episode was directed by Greg Colton, who previously directed the Road to ... episodes \\"Road to Germany\\", \\"Road to the Multiverse\\", and \\"Road to the North Pole\\". It was written by Family Guy veteran Steve Callaghan. \\"Roads to Vegas\\" is Callaghan's first writing credit for a Road to ... episode. In July 2012, the Family Guy panel first announced the episode at the San Diego Comic-Con International by giving a brief plot outline. The episode was revealed as the penultimate episode of the series' eleventh season, airing before the premiere of \\"No Country Club for Old Men\\". Together, the two episodes were promoted as the season finale. On a press release, the Fox Network then officially announced the episode and described it as: > Stewie and Brian use Stewie's time machine to go to Las Vegas for a Bette > Midler concert, but chaos ensues when the machine malfunctions and creates > alt-versions of the pair: a \\"lucky\\" version and an \\"unlucky\\" one. Production of the episode began months in advance according to the episode's writer Steve Callaghan. \\"We're actually working over a year ahead of time,\\" Callaghan says in an interview with Hollywood.com. He added \\"We work so far ahead I can even tell you the finale... the finale is a really cool episode called 'Roads to Vegas.' It's like a road show and Stewie and Brian teleport themselves to Las Vegas, but in the process [they] unknowingly create a duplicate of one another.\\" In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Callaghan recalled the scene in the episode where Brian and Stewie consider joint suicide the most difficult scene for him to write in 2012. In addition to the regular cast, \\"Roads to Vegas\\" featured guest performances from actress Alexandra Breckenridge, actor Ralph Garman, voice actor Joe Lomonaco, and actress and singer Emily Osment. Recurring voice actors and series writers Gary Janetti, Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin, and John Viener also made minor appearances throughout \\"Roads to Vegas\\". Reception During its original airing, the episode was viewed by a total of 5.28 million viewers according to Nielsen ratings. This made it the most viewed episode to premiere that night on Fox's Animation Domination, edging out two episodes of The Cleveland Show and two episodes of The Simpsons. The episode received a 2.6 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The episode received generally positive reviews. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ and said that it \\"isn't typically as heavy on the usual stock jokes that weigh the show down, and the adventures of Brian and Stewie drive more interest than most other characters.\\" Carter Dotson of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.4 rating and called the episode and its sister episode, \\"No Country Club for Old Men\\", \\"a perfect representation of the wild extremes of this season.\\" He added \\"it wasn't the funniest episode, but the way the parallel stories worked and intertwined was at least extremely interesting, lacking much of the lazy humor that at times plagued this season.

It is one of the few windmills in the Netherlands that is still privately owned, and is still in full commercial operation. History Ouddorp is a village on the northwestern tip of the island of Goeree-Overflakkee in Zeeland, with a 14th- century church in the marketplace. The precursor of the mill was built around 1600. The old mill most likely had two pairs of millstone. In 1844 the Voogd family decided to close the old mill and replace it with a round stone mill with three pairs of stones. The mill was built in 1845 for J. Zoeter and D. Voogd, on the site of an existing mill. Until 1952 it had three pairs of millstones for grinding grain for the local farmers. It was then out of service for some time. Between 1982 and 1984 there was a major renovation in which the sails were overhauled and given automatic speed controls. The machinery was entirely replaced. Significant repairs and upgrades were again made in 2008, 2011 and 2012. Operations The mill now operates every day except Sunday, powered by electricity on weekdays and using wind power on Saturdays. The mill may be visited by appointment. The mill is still owned by the Voogd family. As of 2013 the owner was Piet Voogd. There is a store beside the mill where flour products are sold.

Biography  Damon Bossino was educated at Bayside Comprehensive School, where he was a contemporary of Fabian Picardo, the incumbent Chief Minister and leader of the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party. He studied law in England (Kingston University) and after completing his Bar Professional Training Course at the Inns of Court School of Law, he was admitted to the Bar in 1995 (England and Gibraltar). Bossino was a candidate in the 1996 general elections by the Gibraltar National Party (GNP), at the age of 24, with many still recalling the concession speech delivered on behalf of the party the morning after the vote. He left what then became the Liberal Party before the 2000 general elections on the ground of its alliance with the GSLP. Prior to the election and up to the time of his resigning from the party he participated in political debates and interviews on TV and radio. He remained out of front line politics until he stood at the last general election but has been a keen follower of the political scene during that time. In the 2011 general election he was elected as an MP for the Gibraltar Social Democrats and appointed shadow minister for Transport and Tourism. He has had a keen interest in politics since his teens, having participated in school and TV debates on political subjects with Fabian Picardo who was in the same school year, with both making their TV debut debating politics in a programme chaired by Clive Golt in 1991 called ‚ÄòLive from the Rock‚Äô which was filmed from the Rock Hotel.

With the end of hostilities she was returned to the Royal Navy and sold into merchantile service. Service history Candytuft was built at Grangemouth Dry Dock, Grangemouth, as part of the pre-war 1939 programme. One of the original Flower-class corvettes, she was ordered on 25 July 1939, laid down three months later, and launched on 5 July 1940. She was completed on 16 October 1940.Elliott p185 Royal Navy After working up, Candytuft was assigned to the Western Approaches Escort Force for service as a convoy escort. In this role she was engaged in all the duties performed by escort ships; protecting convoys, searching for and attacking U-boats which attacked ships in convoy, and rescuing survivors. Candytuft was involved in one convoy battle. In December 1940, she was part of the escort to convoy OG 46, during which two ships were sunk. In 18 months service, she escorted 13 North Atlantic and two Gibraltar convoys, assisting in the safe passage of over 500 ships, though some were lost subsequently.Hague p In September 1941, while with HX 148 Candytuft suffered a boiler explosion. she was taken under tow to New York, where she underwent repairs, but was out of action for the next four months. In March 1942, while still at New York, Candytuft was transferred to the United States Navy. United States Navy Following the entry of the United States into the war the US Navy was in need of anti-submarine warfare vessels, and to meet this need a number of ships were transferred from the Royal Navy as part of a reverse Lend-Lease arrangement. Candytuft was transferred on 4 March 1942, but required an extensive refit; she was finally commissioned into the USN on 11 June 1942 as USS Tenacity, one of the s. Initially employed as a convoy escort in the Caribbean, Tenacity was moved south in September 1942 to join the US 4th Fleet, the South Atlantic escort force, based in Trinidad. After 17 months service there Tenacity was moved, in January 1944, to the Eastern Sea Frontier, based at Boston.

Kapetanoviƒá arrived to Sarajevo in 1878 where he became the mayor in 1893, holding the office until declining health forced him to resign in 1899. He died in Sarajevo in 1902. During the late 19th century Kapetanoviƒá was active in collecting Bosniak folk treasures in Bosnia and Herzegovina and neighboring regions. He published several books, the most famous being Narodno blago (English: \\"The National Wealth\\") from 1887. In 1891, Kapetanoviƒá founded the influential political journal Bo≈°njak (\\"Bosniak\\") which gathered several Bosniak intellectuals of its time. Kapetanoviƒá became the mayor of Sarajevo in 1893 following the 1892 death of the first mayor Mustafa Fadilpa≈°iƒá. The most significant project during Kapetanoviƒá's governance was the delivery of electricity to the city. Specifically on 1 May 1895, Sarajevo had, for the first time, electric lighting. Until then, the street lights were oil lanterns. On that same day, Sarajevo became one of the first European cities to have electric tram trains installed, replacing horse-drawn vehicles. Kapetanoviƒá survived a stroke in July 1898. His health rapidly declined and by April 1899, he stepped down as mayor. He died on 29 July 1902 at the age of 62.

Life and work Vincenzo Laera began his creative career in the 1980s in the fashion industry of his hometown of Milan. Trained as a hair stylist, he began working as a freelancer for magazines such as Lei and Per Lui early on and collaborated regularly with South African photographer Koto Bolofo. In the late 1980s, Laera, just 20 years old, became a member of Helmut Newton's team. 1989 he moved to New York City. Till 2005 Laera collaborated on projects with Newton and photographers like Albert Watson, Irving Penn, Brigitte Lacombe, Deborah Tuberville, Bert Stern, Greg Gorman, and Annie Leibovitz. During this time, Laera began to work on his own photography. In 2006, when he moved to Berlin, he became self-employed as a professional photographer. Laera worked for magazines like Icon, GQ, Spiegel, InStyle or Kaltblut. Laera's photography is dedicated to the exploration of the male body, beauty, and eros. It reflects the experiences he has made with the icons of fashion photography. His work is also influenced by the black-and-white aesthetic that photographers such as Bruce Weber or Herb Ritts established in the 1980s and 1990s. At the same time, Laera's work is determined by the intensive examination of art and cultural history. Raised in a Catholic family, his work references the traditions of Christian iconography, Italian Renaissance and early Baroque art. At the same time, Laera refers to the formal compositions of classical nude photography and the \\" Neues Sehen\\", the \\"New Vision\\" in the photography of the 1920s. His experiments with light and shadow emphasize the sculptural aspect of the body and the connection with its architectural surroundings. Many of Laera's series oscillate between documentation and staging, control and spontaneity. They also question the boundaries between subject and object. Laera, who often accompanies his models over a long period of time, arranges them in strict formal compositions, often like sculptures in space, and models them with light. He juxtaposes these images with spontaneous shots that also focus on the pictorial composition but underline the vulnerability and individuality of his counterpart in front of the camera.

It is located in the village of Aukrasanden on the southeast coast of the island of Gossa. It is the church for the Aukra parish which is part of the Molde domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of M√∏re. The white, wooden church was built in an octagonal style in 1835 by an unknown architect. The church seats about 250 people. History There has been a church here on Gossa island for centuries. The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to 1495, but the church was already existing at that time. The first church on the island was probably a stave church that was constructed in the 1430s. In 1648, the old church was rebuilt, saving only the old choir of the stave church. Upon completion, the church was a timber-framed cruciform building. In 1663, the old choir part of the church was torn down and replaced. In 1709, the church was destroyed by fire after a lightning strike. In 1712, a new cruciform church was completed replacing the previous one. About 60 years later, in 1772, that building was also struck by lightning and then burning to the ground. In 1774, sadly, the same thing happened again with the newly rebuilt church also being burned down by lightning. Another replacement church was built after that, and it too was burned down in 1834. The present church was built in 1835 and it is still standing.

Marioni was active in the emergence of Conceptual Art movement in the 1960s. He founded the Museum of Conceptual Art (MOCA) in San Francisco from 1970 until 1984. He is currently living and working out of San Francisco, California.  History  Marioni was born 1937 in Cincinnati, Ohio, into an Italian American family with three brothers. His father John \\"Sereno\\" Marioni was a general practitioner doctor and \\"Sunday painter\\" and his mother sang opera and played the harp and the piano.

The song was released on May 3, 2013 on iTunes. On the singer's official Tumblr account Hill revealed that she was required to release the single early in light of her recent legal troubles, which is why the song is called a \\"Compulsory Mix\\". Release and reception In his review for Rolling Stone magazine, music critic Jody Rosen gave the song two-and-a-half out of five stars and said that, although Hill's \\"quicksilver flow is impressive\\", her lyrics are \\"full of gibberish\\" and come off as \\"unintentional cringe comedy\\". Anti-gay controversy The song sparked controversy for its seemingly anti-gay lyrics and message. BET's Monica Miller states: \\"Whether or not Hill is merely using these comments as examples of the smokescreens and sleight-of-hands that pervade this \\"Neurotic Society\\" is unclear. Beyond intention, these sorts of statements suggest that society is in a shambles because it's been taking too many cues from the LGBTQ community, acting like \\"girl men,\\" \\"drag queens\\" and \\"transvestites.\\" Is her beef with oppressive society or is her issue with people who don't abide by a traditional family structure?\\" Lyrics such as \\"greedy men and pride fiends,\\" followed up with \\"drag queens\\" have been used as proof by critics that the song has anti-gay undertones. \\"Social transvestism\\" and \\"subliminal dressed up as piety,\\" have also been spotlighted. Out Magazine's Andrew Belonsky questioned if the \\"latter\\" could be aimed at the Catholic Church. Hill later addressed these issues in an open letter on her tumblr page saying that the song is \\"not targeting any particular group\\"; rather, she proceeds to explain, that it is \\"targeting everyone in our society who hides behind neurotic behavior, rather than deal with it\\". However, she also criticized \\"political correctness\\" causing society to move \\"towards unhealthiness and breakdown.\\" Background \\"Neurotic Society (Compulsory Mix)\\" is Hill's first official studio recording since the release of \\"Turn Your Lights Down Low\\" in November 1999. \\"Neurotic Society\\" is a mid-tempo alternative hip hop song in which Hill raps lyrics at an alarming speed. The lyrics discuss social corruption and corporate manipulation, and their effect on today's youth. The single was announced and released on May 4, 2013 during Hill's tax troubles. During this time Hill reported that she had entered into an agreement with Sony that would allow her to release her own music. Upon the single's release, Hill posted an open letter on her official Facebook page: \\"Here is a link to a piece that I was 'required' to release immediately, by virtue of the impending legal deadline. I love being able to reach people directly, but in an ideal scenario, I would not have to rush the release of new music... but the message is still there. In light of Wednesday's tragic loss (of former label mate Chris Kelly), I am even more pressed to YELL this to a multitude that may not understand the cost of allowing today's unhealthy paradigms to remain unchecked!\\" Hill performed the song live for the first time on May 14, 2013 at Brooklyn's Music Hall of Williamsburg.

Published in Barcelona between 1931 and 1936, its life and destiny were closely linked to those of the ill-fated Second Spanish Republic. Jos√© Mar√≠a Planas Mart√≠n, the director of the magazine, was assassinated by a group of anarchists in the turbulent times that swept over the city of Barcelona at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. History and profile El Be Negre took its name from the Catalan colloquial expression \\"...i un be negre!\\" (meaning \\"and a black sheep!\\"), an exclamation of rotund denial, skepticism or disbelief.(The commonly used abbreviation of \\"...i un be negre amb potes rosses!\\", meaning \\"and a black sheep with blond legs!\\") Llu√≠s Sol√† i Dachs, El B√© Negre (1931 ‚Äì 1936), Quaderns de cultura, Ed. Bruguera, Barcelona 1967 The magazine originated in the Mirador literature, art and politics weekly and was inspired by the French language magazine Le Canard encha√Æn√©, as well as in previous Catalan publications such as Papitu, La Campana de Gr√†cia and L'Esquella de la Torratxa. Its humor was more discreet and thought-provoking though, for it was witty, sharp and made liberal use of irony and ridicule. El Be Negre was first published on 23 June 1931, only two months after the foundation of the Second Spanish Republic. Its founder was Amadeu Hurtado from the La Publicitat newspaper, together with Josep Maria Planes, Rossent Llates and Just Cabot. The director of the magazine was Josep Maria Planes. Other notable members of the team were Josep Maria de Segarra, Valent√≠ Castanys i Borr√†s, Francesc Fontanals (\\"Soka\\"), Avel¬∑l√≠ Art√≠s-Gener \\"Tisner\\", Manuel Amat, Ernest Guasp, Josep Maria Xicota, Andreu Avell√≠ Art√≠s, Carles Sinfeu, Enric Fern√†ndez Gual, Joan Cort√®s i Vidal, Joaquim Muntanyola, Salvador Mestres, Feliu El√≠es (\\"Apa\\") and Rom√† Bonet (\\"Bon\\").El naixement d'El Be Negre, per Enric Marco The half of magazine was published in Catalan and the other part in Spanish. The headquarters of the magazines was in Barcelona. In the same manner as ¬°Cu-Cut! magazine had done two decades previously, El Be Negre steadfastly opposed Lerrouxism in Spain, Radical Republican Party leader Alejandro Lerroux becoming one of the favorite targets of its sharp and humorous criticism. Although its director Josep Maria Planes belonged to Acci√≥ Catalana, even that political group was not spared from the magazine's critical view. The magazine was also well known for its steadfast anti-fascist stance and among the foreign leaders criticized by the magazine's humor were Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.L¬¥Esquella de la Torratxa: la campana que enmudeci√≥ en 1939 El Be Negre would close down on 15 July 1936, right before the pro-fascist coup that would lead to the Spanish Civil War, after having published a total of 245 issues.El be negre (1931-1936) - La Ciberniz The magazine's director Josep Maria Planes would be assassinated following a series of articles on the street violence in Barcelona and its direct relationship with the activity of the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI).Llu√≠s Sol√† i Dachs, Un segle d¬¥humor catal√†, Barcelona, Editorial Bruguera, 1972  See also  * List of magazines in Spain * Cu-Cut! * Alejandro Lerroux *L'Esquella de la Torratxa  References  External links * * Humor a l'art - El Be Negre *Francesc Mestre: Ilustradores Ilustres Category:1931 establishments in Spain Category:1936 disestablishments in Spain Category:Catalan-language magazines Category:Magazines published in Catalonia Category:Defunct magazines published in Spain Category:Satirical magazines published in Spain Category:Magazines established in 1931 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1936 Category:Magazines published in Barcelona Category:Second Spanish Republic Category:Spanish-language magazines Category:Weekly magazines published in Spain ","title":"El Be Negre"},{"id":"39364578","text":"Zabrus ovalis is a species of ground beetle in the Pelor subgenus.

He served a tumultuous term as Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives in the months following the Civil War, where he opposed the radical agenda of Governor William G. Brownlow, most notably refusing to sign the state house's ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1866. A Whig, he had previously served a single term in the Tennessee House, from 1849 to 1851. Heiskell opposed secession and supported the Union during the Civil War. He represented Monroe County at the East Tennessee Convention in 1861. Early life Heiskell was born in Hagerstown, Maryland, one of nine children of Frederic and Catherine (Steidinger) Heiskell. While he was still young, his family moved to the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. Later biographies, including one written by his son, Samuel G. Heiskell, state he served in the Virginia House of Delegates and was a delegate to Virginia's 1829-1830 constitutional convention,University of Tennessee Record, Vol. 1 (1898), pp. 243-244.Samuel Gordon Heiskell, \\"Honorable William Heiskell,\\" Andrew Jackson and Early Tennessee History (Ambrose Printing Company, 1920), pp. 554-564. though he doesn't appear in the list of delegates in the latter's official proceedings.Proceedings and Debates of the Virginia State Convention of 1829-1830 (S. Shepherd and Company, 1830), pp. 3-4. In 1833, Heiskell moved to Monroe County, Tennessee, where he established a plantation in the Little Tennessee Valley. Aligning himself with the new Whig Party, he presided over the 1844 East Tennessee Whig Convention, which met at Knoxville to nominate candidates for that year's elections.Samuel G. Heiskell, Andrew Jackson and Early Tennessee History, p. 241. He also championed railroad construction, helping to organize the East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad in the late 1840s. In 1846, Heiskell ran on the Whig ticket for Monroe County's seat in the state legislature. His Democratic opponent, John Ramsey, successfully portrayed him as a flashy aristocrat who was fond of toddy and store-bought clothes, and Heiskell was defeated.William Ballard Lenoir, History of Sweetwater Valley (Presbyterian Committee of Publication, 1916), pp. 159-161, 278-279. Accessed at Archive.org 7 May 2013. He won the seat in the subsequent election, however, serving from 1849 to 1851. Civil War Like many former East Tennessee Whigs, Heiskell opposed secession on the eve of the Civil War, and remained loyal to the Union during the course of the war. He described the nation as an \\"indestructible union of indestructible States.\\" In 1861, he represented Monroe County at both the Knoxville and Greeneville sessions of the East Tennessee Convention, which would petition the Confederate-aligned state legislature to allow East Tennessee to break away and form a Union- aligned state. At the Knoxville session, he was appointed one of the convention's assistant vice presidents.War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Vol VII, Part I (Government Printing Office, 1898), pp. 150-153. The Heiskell family was divided during the Civil War. William Heiskell and his brother, Frederick Heiskell, remained loyal to the Union. William's wife, Julia, however, supported the Confederacy, and Frederick's son, Joseph, served in the Confederate Congress. During the course of the war, Heiskell moved to Knoxville. After General Ambrose Burnside occupied the city in September 1863, William \\"Parson\\" Brownlow, a staunch pro-Unionist, was appointed special agent to the Treasury Department, and in turn hired Heiskell as an assistant.Robert McKenzie, Lincolnites and Rebels: A Divided Town in the American Civil War (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 187-189, 203. In March 1864, Jim Heiskell, a former slave of Heiskell who had fled when Burnside occupied the city, alleged that Heiskell and an overseer had kidnapped and beaten him for running away. He further alleged that his brother, Robert, had been arrested for helping him escape. Heiskell denied the charge, and Brownlow defended him in a letter to the Treasury Department. No action was taken, though Jim Heiskell was given documents by General John Schofield asserting that he was a free citizen. Toward the end of the war, Heiskell helped several former Confederates who were seeking pardons. Like many of the more conservative Unionists, he began to turn against Brownlow, who was seeking retribution against ex-Confederates. In a private letter, Heiskell's brother, Frederick, referred to Brownlow as an \\"unmitigated humbug.\\" Speakership In 1865, Heiskell was again elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives, this time representing Knox County. When the House convened on April 3, Heiskell was elected Speaker, defeating James R. Hood of Hamilton County by a vote of 37 to 29.Dan Robison, \\"Little Men and Big Events: A Passing Look at Some Tennessee Legislators,\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 41 (1969), p. 9. Among the first orders of business was the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, which easily passed the House and was certified on April 7. The legislature also passed the \\"franchise law,\\" which barred ex- Confederates from voting.Stanley Folmsbee, Robert Corlew, and Enoch Mitchell, Tennessee: A Short History (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1969), p. 354. Heiskell voted against the latter, prompting calls for his resignation from the allies of Brownlow, who was now governor.\\"Union Meeting in Knoxville,\\" Brownlow's Knoxville Whig and Rebel Ventilator, 6 September 1865. Accessed at Library of Congress Chronicling America database, 11 May 2013. Throughout the summer of 1865, the rift between Brownlow's allies, who had aligned themselves nationally with the Radical Republicans, and the \\"Conservative Unionists,\\" who had aligned themselves with President Andrew Johnson, continued to grow. Conservative Unionists, led by Heiskell, were outraged when Brownlow threw out thousands of votes in the August 1865 congressional elections, allowing Radical candidate Samuel Arnell to win in the 6th district. The Conservatives also endorsed Johnson's veto of the Freedmen's Bureau bill in early 1866, which Radicals in Congress and Tennessee had championed. In February 1866, Brownlow's allies in the legislature introduced a second franchise law, creating stricter voter registration requirements, and giving the governor the power to throw out entire counties' voter registrations. Conservatives vehemently opposed this bill, as they felt Brownlow had already abused the powers given to him by the first franchise law. Realizing they lacked the votes to stop the bill, several Conservatives withdrew from the House to prevent a quorum. When Representative James Mullins, a Brownlow ally, accused Heiskell of organizing the quorum-bust, Heiskell called Mullins a \\"God damned old liar and a damned thief\\" and threw his gavel at Mullins, nearly igniting a brawl. The law finally passed in May, after several more weeks of infighting.E. Merton Coulter, William G. Brownlow: Fighting Parson of the Southern Highlands (University of Tennessee Press, 1999; originally published in 1937), pp. 283-284, 311-314. The struggle between Radicals and Conservatives touched off an editorial war in newspapers across the state.

Accessed at Library of Congress Chronicling America database, 11 May 2013. After the amendment cleared the state senate, its opponents in the state house, lacking the votes to stop its passage, once again fled the Capitol to prevent a quorum. In response, the house sergeant-at-arms rounded up two and confined them to the committee room. Heiskell ruled that this did not constitute a quorum, but the house overrode his decision, and the amendment was passed. Heiskell refused to sign it, and resigned the speakership in disgust. The Speaker pro tempore, John Norman, signed the amendment, however, and Brownlow quickly certified its ratification. Later life, family and legacy Heiskell died on September 9, 1871. He is interred with his wife, Julia, at Old Gray Cemetery in Knoxville. Heiskell's brother, Frederick (1786-1882), was the cofounder of the Knoxville Register, and served one term in the Tennessee Senate (1847-1849). His son, Samuel Gordon Heiskell (1858-1923), served several terms as Mayor of Knoxville in the 1890s and early 1900s. A nephew, Joseph Brown Heiskell (1823-1913), served in the Tennessee Senate in the late 1850s, and represented the 1st district in the Confederate Congress during the Civil War. Another nephew, Carrick, was a prominent Memphis-area judge. John Netherland Heiskell, a great-nephew, briefly served as a U.S. Senator from Arkansas. Heiskell was appointed to the Board of Trustees for East Tennessee University (the modern University of Tennessee) in 1865. He also served on the inaugural Board of Trustees of Hiwassee College. Two stained glass windows in the St. John's Episcopal Cathedral in downtown Knoxville are dedicated to Heiskell and his wife, Julia. Heiskell, Tennessee, a small community in northern Knox County, is named for the Heiskells. See also *Charles Inman *Samuel R.

In 2008, VMware announced it was licensing Teradici's PCoIP protocol. Teradici developed a software implementation of PCoIP, which VMware started shipping in VMware View 4.

The protocol is available in hardware and in software. In 2008, VMware licensed Teradici's PCoIP protocol, and supports it in VMware Horizon View. In 2013 Amazon licensed the PCoIP protocol for use in AWS Amazon Workspaces. PCoIP is a UDP-based protocol that is host rendered, multi-codec and dynamically adaptive. Images rendered on the server are captured as pixels, compressed and encoded and then sent to the client for decryption and decompression. Depending on the image, different codecs are used to encode the pixels sent since techniques to compress video images differ in effectiveness compared to those for text. The protocol also dynamically adapts its encoding based on the available bandwidth. In low-bandwidth environments it uses lossy compression where a highly compressed image is quickly delivered, followed by additional data to refine that image, a process termed \\"build to perceptually lossless\\". The default is to use lossless compression which is used when there is minimal network congestion or when explicitly configured, as might be required for scenarios where image fidelity is more important than conserving bandwidth, e.g. for medical imaging.

It was built by Cameron Balloons in Bristol, United Kingdom, and first flew in Australia in 2013. The balloon's design received a mixed response after it was publicly unveiled in May 2013. It has since been displayed around the world, and was acquired by the National Gallery of Australia in 2019. Development Ahead of the centenary of the Australian national capital city of Canberra in 2013, the creative director of the centenary celebrations, Robyn Archer, commissioned the sculptor Patricia Piccinini in 2010 to develop a balloon. Piccinini grew up in Canberra and completed a degree in economics at the Australian National University before becoming a successful sculptor. She has received praise for creating highly realistic sculptures of human-like living creatures, and her work has been exhibited worldwide. Archer selected Piccinini for the project in recognition of the sculptor's connections to Canberra; other prominent former Canberrans have also been asked to participate in the centenary celebrations. Piccinini had not previously designed a balloon. Piccinini's intention when designing the balloon was to fashion it as sculpture of a living creature rather than a \\"balloon that looked like something\\". She was inspired by the planned nature of Canberra, and has described the work as: The official website of The Skywhale describes Piccinini's design as follows: Construction After developing her design, Piccinini and her studio developed a 3D model of the balloon using computer-aided design software. This process was used to address the technical issues involved with developing a balloon which was safe to fly, as well as to fine-tune the appearance of the design. The Australian Capital Territory's government invited five specialist balloon manufacturers to submit proposals to construct The Skywhale, but the Bristol-based company Cameron Balloons was the only one to provide a bid. Once the initial design was complete it was passed to Cameron Balloons which further developed the plans in consultation with Piccinini. The final design was for a high and long balloon capable of a carrying a pilot and two passengers to a maximum altitude of . The balloon weighs half a tonne and includes more than 3,500 square metres of fabric. It took a team of six workers seven months to complete the balloon. Due to its large size, The Skywhale is slower to ascend and descend than traditional balloons. The total construction cost was $A172,000 and the balloon has a lifespan of about 100 flights. The owner and operator of The Skywhale, Kiff Saunders, has commented that the balloon's design posed some issues during landing, stating the \\"Skywhale's length and her pendulous breasts make her more difficult to land.\\" The Skywhale arrived in Australia in early 2013, and made its initial test flight near Mount Arapiles in Victoria during April that year. Piccinini was a passenger on this flight, an experience she described as \\"awe inspiring\\". However, as the balloon's basket is small and has low walls she also reported feeling at danger of falling out of it during the flight. Some of the balloon's stitching came loose during this flight, and it was air freighted back to Bristol at the expense of Cameron Balloons to be repaired. Piccinini was paid $8,800 for designing The Skywhale. She has stated that this is much less than an artist would typically receive for a project of this scale, and she agreed to the reduced fee as she was impressed with Robyn Archer's plans for the centenary celebrations and believed that developing the balloon would be a \\"unique and extraordinary opportunity\\". Reception The Skywhale viewed from below during its first flight over Canberra The face of The Skywhale The Skywhales design received a mixed reception after the balloon was unveiled on 9 May 2013. Australian Capital Territory Chief Minister Katy Gallagher said that her eyes \\"nearly fell out of her head\\" when she first saw a diagram of The Skywhales design, but she had come to like it and believed that it would challenge the perception of Canberra as a boring city. She also stated that \\"There will be people in the community who think it's a great achievement to have won a commission like this in the ACT and have it as a symbol of our centenary and those who won't see it as value for money\\". The leader of the opposition in the ACT, Jeremy Hanson, was critical of The Skywhale stating that \\"I really don't know whether to laugh or cry ... it's an embarrassing indulgence only a fourth term government would contemplate\\". Public views of the design, as expressed on social media and talkback radio, were also mixed. Much of the public criticism has been focused on the five breasts which hang from each side of the balloon, with a Twitter user calling it \\"terrifyingly nipply\\". The director of the Canberra Museum and Gallery wrote an opinion article praising The Skywhale, arguing that the strength of the design \\"arises from how it concentrates the wonder, awe and mystery we experience in nature, with an urgent insistence on social engagement\\". The Canberra Times' art critic Kerry- Anne Cousins complemented the boldness of the design, and stated that \\"I think it's a mark of the sophistication of Canberra that we can have this kind of debate\\". In response to the criticism of the balloon's design, Piccinini stated that it wasn't intended to be sexual and the breasts represent how female whales feed their calves. She also believed that The Skywhale is likely to win greater support once Canberrans see it in person. Piccinini was hurt by the criticism of the artwork in Australia, and in 2017 believed that it would be \\"almost impossible\\" to attract funding to fly it in the country again. In 2019 The Canberra Times reported that The Skywhale had attracted more publicity than any other element of Canberra's centenary celebrations. The balloon received a more positive reception outside of Australia. It raised Piccinini's profile, and contributed to her exhibitions attracting large crowds. The New York Times reported that \\"The artwork itself has also gained a global following. Songs have been written about it, cakes made in its shape, and several people have contacted Ms. Piccinini to tell her they have tattooed the creature onto their bodies\\". The cost of the balloon and the arrangements under which it was funded also attracted criticism. The executive director of culture for the ACT Chief Minister‚Äôs directorate informed the media on 9 May that the balloon and its supporting website cost about $170,000. Documents released the next day showed that the total cost to the government of commissioning and operating The Skywhale over its lifespan will be $300,000, and the philanthropic Aranday Foundation will provide a further $50,000. Moreover, the balloon will remain the property of the Melbourne-based company Global Ballooning and only one flight was scheduled for Canberra at the time. In response, Jeremy Hanson stated that \\"this $300,000 extravagance again shows out of touch the ACT Government is with Canberrans' priorities\\". Katy Gallagher has stated that the Government considered retaining ownership of the balloon during its development, but decided against this option as it would have also involved funding all of The Skywhales operating costs. Robyn Archer defended the project, arguing that the balloon's cost was relatively low, and represented \\"a bargain for public art\\". Piccinini has also said that \\"it's an aeronautical machine. People's lives depend on it. It has to function properly and that's what it costs, to make a balloon\\". While Global Ballooning owns The Skywhale, Piccinini retains the intellectual property to the balloon and the company does not expect to make much money from displaying and operating it. The director of Global Ballooning believes that The Skywhale will become self funding when international galleries begin to exhibit it. Flights and displays The Skywhales first flight in Canberra took place on 11 May 2013, with the balloon flying from the grounds of the National Gallery of Australia to the National Museum of Australia on the other side of Lake Burley Griffin. Hundreds of Canberrans were present to watch the flight. Further flights and appearances were scheduled for Hobart and Melbourne at this time, and there were plans to also exhibit the balloon in other parts of Australia and overseas where it will be acknowledged as having been commissioned to mark the centenary of Canberra. Piccinini has described The Skywhale as being one of the highlights of her career. The Skywhale was flown in Hobart and Launceston as part of the Dark MoFo festival in June 2013. In November that year it was displayed in Melbourne. In September 2014 The Skywhale was exhibited at the Trans Arts Tokyo festival in Japan. It was not present at the 2015 Canberra Balloon Spectacular as Global Ballooning lodged its application to participate in the event after the deadline for entrants. As of March 2015 it had been flown for 60 hours out of an estimated flying life of 600 hours. In January 2017, it was reported that the balloon had also been displayed in Ireland and Brazil, and was being shipped back to Australia. It was displayed in the Yarra Valley in late 2018 and the Hunter Valley in April 2019. The Skywhale was donated to the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) in 2019. The gallery intends to fly it in Canberra and other parts of Australia. In November 2019 the NGA announced that it had acquired a second balloon designed by Piccinini called Skywhalepapa. The new balloon will depict a male skywhale holding its children, and will be flown alongside The Skywhale from March 2020. The NGA called the pair of balloons \\"a Skywhale family\\", and stated they would be flown over Canberra and other locations in Australia.

The film stars Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson, a faded Hollywood actor best known for playing the superhero \\"Birdman\\", as he struggles to mount a Broadway adaptation of a short story by Raymond Carver. The film also features a supporting cast of Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Andrea Riseborough, Amy Ryan, Emma Stone, and Naomi Watts. The film covers the period of previews leading to the play's opening, and with a brief exception appears as if filmed in a single shot, an idea I√±√°rritu had from the film's conception. Emmanuel Lubezki, who won the Academy Award for his cinematography in Birdman, believed that the recording time necessary for the long take approach taken in Birdman could not have been made with older technology. The film was shot in New York City during the spring of 2013 with a budget of $16.5 million jointly financed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, New Regency Pictures and Worldview Entertainment. It premiered the following year in August where it opened the 71st Venice International Film Festival. Birdman had a limited theatrical release in the United States on October 17, 2014, followed by a wide release on November 14. Grossing more than $103 million worldwide, the film received critical acclaim, with praise for the performances of the cast (particularly those of Keaton, Stone, and Norton), cinematography, I√±√°rritu's direction and screenplay. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture, along with Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography from a total of nine nominations, tying it with The Grand Budapest Hotel for the most nominated and awarded film at the Academy's 87th annual awards ceremony with four wins per film. It also won Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards, as well as Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for Keaton and Best Screenplay at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards. Plot Riggan Thomson is a faded American actor famous for playing a superhero named Birdman in a film trilogy in the 1990s. He is tormented by the mocking and critical internal voice of Birdman and frequently visualizes himself performing feats of levitation and telekinesis. Riggan is trying to gain recognition as a serious actor for writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story, \\"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.\\" However, the Birdman voice wants Riggan to return to blockbuster cinema and insists that he is an essential part of Riggan's identity. Jake, Riggan's best friend and lawyer, is producing the play, which co-stars Riggan's girlfriend, Laura, and Broadway d√©butante Lesley. Riggan's daughter Sam, a recovering drug addict with whom he is trying to reconnect, is working as his assistant. The day before the first preview, a light fixture falls onto Riggan's hapless co-star, Ralph. At Lesley's suggestion, Riggan replaces Ralph with her boyfriend, the brilliant but volatile and self-absorbed method actor Mike Shiner. The first previews are disastrous: Mike breaks character over the replacement of his gin with water, attempts to rape Lesley during a sex scene, and claims that the prop gun does not look real, which is hindering his performance. Riggan clashes continually with Mike, climaxing into a fight scene after Riggan reads a New York Times interview with Mike in which he steals Riggan's personal reason for doing a Raymond Carver play. Jake persuades Riggan to continue with the play. When Riggan berates Sam after finding her using marijuana, she insultingly rebukes and chastises him, telling him he doesn't matter and the play is for his own vanity. All the while, the Birdman voice continues talking with Riggan, judging him as well as everyone and everything around him. During the final preview, Riggan accidentally locks himself outside with his robe stuck in the fire escape door. He is forced to walk through Times Square in his underpants and enter through the audience to do the final scene. A concerned Sam is waiting in his dressing room after the show. She thinks the performance was very unusual but interesting. She shows him that the Times Square footage is going viral and explains how this actually helps him. Riggan goes to a bar for a drink and approaches Tabitha Dickinson, a highly influential (albeit cynical) theater critic. She tells him that she hates ignorant Hollywood celebrities who pretend to be serious actors and promises to \\"kill\\" his play with a deprecating review without even having seen it; offended, he angrily rebukes her criticisms as prejudiced bias and insults her, crumpling up her notes before she leaves in disgust. On the way back, Riggan buys a pint of whiskey, drinks it, and passes out on a stoop. The next day, walking to the theater with a severe hangover, he has a conversation with the now visible Birdman, who tries to convince him to abandon the play and make a fourth Birdman film. A brief, imaginary action film sequence takes place on the street nearby, and Birdman mocks the moviegoing public's love of spectacle while looking directly at the audience. Riggan visualizes himself flying through the streets of Manhattan before arriving at the theater. On the opening night, the play is going very well. In his dressing room, a strangely calm Riggan confesses to his ex-wife, Sylvia, that several years ago, he attempted to drown himself in the ocean after she caught him having an affair. He also tells her about his inner Birdman voice, which she ignores. After Sylvia wishes him luck and leaves the room, Riggan picks up a real gun, rather than a prop, for the final scene in which his character commits suicide. At the climax, Riggan shoots himself in the head on stage. The play receives a standing ovation as Tabitha stands and leaves. The next day, Riggan wakes up in a hospital with his face covered in a mask of bandages where his nose has been surgically reconstructed after he blew it off during the botched suicide. Sylvia is worried about him, but Jake cannot contain his excitement that the play will run forever after Tabitha published a glowing review acclaiming the play, which called the suicide attempt a new art, \\"super-realism,\\" and just what American theater needed. Sam visits with flowers, which he cannot smell, and takes a picture of him to share with the skyrocketing number of followers on the Twitter account she has created for him. While she steps outside to find a vase, Riggan goes into the bathroom, removes the bandages revealing his swollen new nose, and obscenely says goodbye to Birdman, seen seated on the toilet. Fascinated by the birds flying outside his room, he opens the window, peers up at them, and then climbs out onto the ledge. Sam returns to an empty room and frantically runs to the open window, scanning the ground before slowly looking up into the sky and smiling. Cast Production Development Birdman director Alejandro G. I√±√°rritu originally conceived the film as a comedy filmed in a single shot set in a theatre. The original choice behind the film's genre, which was subsequently re-adapted to concentrate on Riggan's final emotional tail spin, came from the director wanting to see a change in his approach. All his previous films were dramas, and after directing Biutiful, he did not want to approach his new film in the same tragic manner again. The decision to make the film appear as a single shot came from his realization that \\"we live our lives with no editing\\". By presenting the film as a continuous shot, he could \\"submerge the protagonist in an 'inescapable reality' and take the audience with him\\". I√±√°rritu shared his idea with the Argentine screenwriters/cousins Nicol√°s Giacobone and Armando Bo, as well as playwright Alexander Dinelaris, Jr., who had all worked with him on his previous film. Their first reaction was to tell him the continuous-shot idea could not work. According to Dinelaris and Giacobone, \\"huge\\" and \\"important\\" people told him to not even try the project for the same reason. I√±√°rritu himself described the technique as \\"almost suicidal\\", worrying that it would be distracting, instead of immersive. Dinelaris later said that had they truly paused and considered the idea, they might have talked I√±√°rritu out of it. The personal and vocational experiences of the four co-writers were central to writing the script. Dinelaris' exposure to Broadway shaped the depictions of rehearsals and events backstage, though he admitted exaggerating these. He also felt his background writing long scenes of dialogue helped since scenes in the film \\"were really more like play scenes\\". I√±√°rritu's own experiences influenced many of Birdmans themes. \\"What this film talks about, I have been through\\", I√±√°rritu recalled. \\"I have seen and experienced all of it; it's what I have been living through the last years of my life.\\" Dinelaris described this aspect as \\"a laughing look at oneself\\", but said it had to be done in a comedic way; otherwise, \\"it would have been the most unbelievably self-absorbed look at the subject\\". Themes from Raymond Carver's short story \\"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\\", which Riggan adapts for stage in the story, also influenced the script. I√±√°rritu wanted to find the connection between the themes in Riggan's story and those of Carver's. Because of this, it was important to the director that Carver's story be the subject of the play depicted within the film. Therefore, I√±√°rritu stated that his desire to use Carver's work was \\"terrifying\\" because the rights to using the Carver material were still subject to the possibility of being rejected during development of the film, but no issues arose. Carver's widow, writer Tess Gallagher, loved the script and permitted the adaptation, saying that Carver would be laughing about the film. While some aspects of the film the first frame with Riggan, for instance went unchanged from Birdman's conception to release, others went through several iterations. One of these was the sequence in which alter ego Birdman takes complete control over Riggan's thoughts. The writers knew it would occur at Riggan's lowest point, so at one stage planned for it to happen after Riggan hears the initial negative press coverage and destroys his dressing room. In another discarded version, Riggan tries to drown himself in Central Park and flies out to save himself. The film's ending also changed, the final version being written halfway through filming. The original intended to depict Johnny Depp in Riggan's dressing room with a Pirates of the Caribbean poster in the back. I√±√°rritu grew to strongly dislike this ending, calling it \\"so embarrassing\\", and rewrote it with Dinelaris and Giacobone after a new ending came to him in a dream. I√±√°rritu was reluctant to describe the original ending, but it was leaked by Dinelaris. He said the original ending was set in the theatre, instead of the hospital, and involved Depp putting on Riggan Thomson's wig, and in Jack Sparrow's voice, \\"... the poster asks Depp, 'What the fuck are we doing here, mate?', and it was going to be the satire of the endless loop of that.\\" The director and co-authors ruled out the satirical ending, and favored the new, more ambiguous, ending. The project of co-writing was expedited by the collaboration between the four co-writers on the internet working from different geographical locations. With I√±√°rritu in Los Angeles, Giacobone and Bo in Buenos Aires, and Dinelaris in New York, the script was mainly written through Skype calls and emails. Although this complicated the writing process, Dinelaris said he believed the best ideas in Birdman came from Skype sessions at two in the morning where he and Giacobone were \\"cracking each other up\\". Incorporating the one-shot feature also affected the writing. Bo said: \\"We wrote everything thinking of this one shot, and a lot of decisions that would mostly be taken in the editing room were taken before shooting\\". The one-shot approach meant the scenes could not be removed or re-ordered in post- production, so the writers needed to be \\"very, very sure about what was on the page\\". As a result, it took about a year and a half to complete the final draft. As Dinelaris summarized: \\"You have to be an idiot to do it all in one shot. You have to be an idiot to attempt it. It takes a great, great deal of ignorance to not pay attention to the difficulties and to think you're going to do this. Birdman looks like a good idea now, but [at the time of production] we did not know how we would land.\\" Casting Michael Keaton was I√±√°rritu's first choice to play Riggan Thomson. I√±√°rritu cast several of the leading roles before the film was financed. Among these was the lead role. Early in script development, I√±√°rritu did not have Keaton in mind, but he had changed his mind by the end: \\"When I finished the script, I knew that Michael was not the choice or option, he was the guy\\". I√±√°rritu cast Keaton for his depth in a variety of acting styles: He could handle the demands of the stage, up-close work, and comedy and empathy \\"with a profound depth to both\\". Keaton knew about Birdman before I√±√°rritu contacted him. He was in the middle of production of another project when he learned that I√±√°rritu was making another film. Keaton, a fan of his work, flew home to find out more. I√±√°rritu sent him the script and they discussed it over dinner. The first thing Keaton asked the director was whether he was making fun of him (regarding his role in Tim Burton's Batman films), but after I√±√°rritu explained the role, its technicalities, and the film's production, Keaton agreed to play Riggan. I√±√°rritu called his decision behind casting Galifianakis as Jake \\"a bet\\". Galifianakis met the director's criteria of being lovable and funny, but I√±√°rritu also considered him sensitive, which scored him the role. Emma Stone already knew she wanted to work with I√±√°rritu before she was offered the role of Sam. The script that I√±√°rritu gave her and the rest of the cast came with the photo Man on Wire, which featured Philippe Petit crossing the Twin Towers on a tightrope. I√±√°rritu told the cast, \\"We are doing that\\". Once these actors were committed, I√±√°rritu sought funding. He first invited Fox Searchlight Pictures to finance the project, but they turned his offer down because they felt his asking budget was too high. At one stage Megan Ellison of Annapurna Pictures wanted to be involved in the project, but decided against it because, unlike her other films, she had not been involved since the beginning. I√±√°rritu approached Brad Weston, president of New Regency, who accepted the offer. When executive Claudia Lewis of Searchlight heard about the deal, she reconsidered and asked to be included in the deal. Searchlight and New Regency had previously worked together to finance 12 Years a Slave, and they decided to join together for Birdman, financing a budget of $16.5 million. Weston and Lewis developed a close relationship with I√±√°rritu, editing the script with him and switching some of the actors. When they joined production, Josh Brolin was set to play the role of Mike Shiner, but the financiers decided to switch him for Norton because of scheduling conflicts. He said Norton's experience as a theatre actor, combined with his self-confidence, meant that \\"in a way, there was some kind of mental reality to Edward\\", but Norton believes he was the one who convinced I√±√°rritu to take him on. Norton was a fan of the director's work and impressed with his ability to push outside film-making boundaries. Norton heard about I√±√°rritu's project from a friend. Once he got the script, he read it straight through until 3:00 am. Norton said, \\"I laughed so hard I woke people up.\\" Norton wanted to meet I√±√°rritu the next day, and once they met, Norton told him he could not cast someone who was the \\"embodiment\\" of what the script was taking aim at. Instead, the director needed to cast someone \\"who has at least a little bit of authentic depth of experience, in this world\\". I√±√°rritu agreed. Ryan, one of the last actors to be cast, was invited because I√±√°rritu had seen her in the play Detroit. Lindsay Duncan had vast experience in the theatre world too, and decided to accept the offer to play the critic because of the quality of the script. \\"It's delicious because of the writing.\\" But like Shiner's character, I√±√°rritu found casting Laura difficult. Riseborough met him on a street corner for a cup of tea, and recalling the event, said, \\"I told him that I would crawl across hot coals to work with him\\". I√±√°rritu described Laura as \\"a very wacky, quirky role\\", but said, \\"when [Andrea Riseborough] did it, I knew that it was her, because she did it right in the tone, and she understood who she was ‚Äì she was not judging\\". Rehearsal and filming Michael Keaton (Riggan) rehearsing an action-sequence of the film Once the writing was finished, I√±√°rritu contacted friend and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki to discuss his idea for the film. After reading the script, Lubezki was worried that I√±√°rritu would offer him the job since Birdman \\"had all of the elements of a movie that I did not want to do at all\\" comedy, studio work and long takes but changed his mind after further discussion with the director. The pair had worked together on commercials and a short film in the anthology To Each His Own Cinema, but not on any feature films. Lubezki wanted to be sure that this was a decision Rodrigo Prieto, cinematographer of all four of I√±√°rritu's feature films, was comfortable with, but after receiving his blessing, the two headed into pre-production. Lubezki was concerned that no film had been shot in the way I√±√°rritu envisioned, meaning there would be no reference material to look up. The two decided the only way to learn how to shoot it would be to shoot it themselves, so they hired a warehouse in Sony Studios, Los Angeles, and built a proxy stage. The setup was minimal. Canvas and C-stands were used for walls, while tape and a few pieces of furniture marked out areas. Using a camera and some stand-ins, the duo worked through the movie to see if it was possible. Realizing no theatre could accommodate the intricate camerawork they needed, they hired Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York. Still, I√±√°rritu wanted to shoot at a Broadway theater, but would have to wait until several weeks into rehearsals before securing St. James Theatre. They then spent a few months designing and making \\"blueprints\\" of the shots and blocking the scenes, using the stand-ins to read and walk through the script. The planning was precise. I√±√°rritu said: \\"There was no room to improvise at all. Every movement, every line, every door opening, absolutely everything was rehearsed.\\" The actors started rehearsing once this preliminary work was completed: According to Lubezki, they did the scenes with the actors \\"once we kind of knew what the rhythm of the scenes were\\". He described the atypical approach \\"like an upside down movie where you do post-production before the production\\". Editors Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione were involved in the project by this stage. When I√±√°rritu told Mirrione that he planned for Lubezki to record table readings and the rehearsals, he suggested they edit them immediately to discover what was and was not working early on. The editing also allowed the editors to discuss pacing issues with the director, such as the position of the night-day transitions and other moments of rest in the film. Production designer Kevin Thompson was on hand too, and mapped out the scenes. The camerawork required many elements of the set to be built in a certain way. For example, Riggan's makeup mirror and desk were constructed so that the camera would see his reflection. Thompson also took into consideration the needs of the crew, for instance designing the stairs a little wider for Steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff's footsize. He then constructed a template of the set they would build when in New York. The writers were also involved in the rehearsals, fine-tuning the script to \\"make sure the film was fluid and never stopped\\". Once the logistics of the scenes were worked out and they had the timing down, the team headed to Kaufman Studios for more rehearsals, followed by principal photography based exclusively in New York during the spring of 2013. The studios were used to film the backstage areas of the film, including Riggan's dressing room and the theatre corridors. St. James Theatre was used for two weeks; it was the location for the stage scenes. The bar segments were shot in The Rum House on 47th Street, and 43rd Street was used for the action- sequence. The film was unable to be shot chronologically because of scheduling with the theatre. Throughout the locations, including the studio, the scenes were lit with natural light, since Lubezki wanted the movie \\"to look as naturalistic as possible\\". The night-time scenes were possible to film in this way due to the brightness of New York. Lubezki found lighting the scenes to be the hardest part of his work on the film. Not only did the lighting need to look realistic, but also had to be designed so that the continuous movements of the camera did not project the crew's shadows onto the actors. Throughout shooting, Arri Alexa cameras were used; an Alexa M was used for handheld sequences, and an Alexa XT was attached to the Steadicam. Neither used matteboxes, however. Steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff explained this decision: \\"We didn't want this big black thing gliding into their eyeline. This way we could get very close and get the light past the lens and onto the actor's face.\\" Lubezki who did all the handheld camerawork had chosen the Alexa M because the camera was very small and allowed him to get into tiny spaces and close to the actors, sometimes filming two inches away from Keaton's face. The camera also allowed recording for such a long period necessary for the long takes of the movie that Lubezki went so far as to say the movie would have been impossible to do years before. The cameras were lensed with Leica Summilux-C or Zeiss Master Primes. Lubezki stated that these gave clean images, saying \\"You can have all these lights in the frame and they are not really causing bad flare or things like that\\". In terms of sizes, they initially trialled a 21mm, but this did not give I√±√°rritu the \\"intimacy\\" he wanted. The crew instead went to an 18mm Leica, which was used for the majority of the film. Only when emphasis was needed did they switch the lens to a 14mm, but this was rare. Despite all the preparation, a typical shooting day would begin with rehearsals. These usually lasted most of the morning, after which photography followed. The meticulous timing for the scenes meant that takes were cancelled because of the slightest mishaps. Emma Stone, in an interview with Jimmy Fallon, recalled how a six-minute take of the scene where Riggan first meets Mike was ruined after she walked around a corner too quickly. Takes were also repeated if a scene's rhythm did not feel right to I√±√°rritu, or if he and Lubezki were not satisfied with a shot's framing. As shooting progressed lines of dialog would also be dropped, giving I√±√°rritu more options during post-production. Because of this, the number of takes for a given scene was high, usually twenty for the shorter scenes, the takes running smoothly around the fifteenth. Chris Haarhoff described it as \\"a type of dance where everyone would hopefully try to peak all at the same moment\\". The locations sometimes placed restrictions on the takes too; the live Times Square sequence was shot only twice since they did not want to attract the attention of tourists. Whenever shooting was taking place there was pressure on everyone involved, but the cast had a positive experience. Norton said that normally in movie production half the people can \\"check out\\" due to repetitive aspects, but during the shooting of Birdman, \\"everybody's on, the whole thing, and you're all on pins and needles because you're all relying on forty other people not to drop the ball\\". Because of this, Stone said the director was able to get the best out of the cast, saying I√±√°rritu's process \\"creates this sort of fury in you, and then you end up realizing that he just got so much out of you that you didn't even know you had\\". Naomi Watts commented that the atmosphere \\"felt emblematic of how it feels onstageat least my long-time memories from long ago\\". Andrea Riseborough, meanwhile, described the process as \\"wonderful\\", mentioning how it was possible to hear the filming of a sequence from far away before the camera arrived, and then \\"the magic happens with you, and then everything leaves you, and everything's silent\\". Once they successfully completed a take though, it was obvious to everybody involved. Norton said: \\"I've never, ever been on a set where every day ended with an enormous, authentic sort of cheer at having made it. You're waiting for the scream from [I√±√°rritu], and everybody was genuinely excited.\\" Music and soundtrack The film's original music segments are a drum score consisting entirely of solo jazz percussion performances by Antonio S√°nchez. The score is offset by a number of well known classical music pieces, including Mahler and Tchaikovsky. I√±√°rritu did not regard the particular choice of classical pieces as important. Nonetheless, the choice of classical music was strongly oriented to highly melodic scores taken predominantly from the 19th century classical repertoire (Mahler, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Ravel). I√±√°rritu stated that the classical components come from the world of the play, citing the radio in Riggan's room and the show itself as two sources of the music. The classical music segments also included two compositions by American composer John Adams. Several jazz compositions by Victor Hern√°ndez Stumpfhauser and Joan Valent counterbalance the original music composition by S√°nchez. The drum sections comprise the majority of the score, however, and were composed by S√°nchez. I√±√°rritu explained the choice by saying they helped to structure scenes, and that \\"The drums, for me, was a great way to find the rhythm of the film... In comedy, rhythm is king, and not having the tools of editing to determine time and space, I knew I needed something to help me find the internal rhythm of the film.\\" Jazz drummer Antonio S√°nchez composed and recorded the score for the film. I√±√°rritu contacted friend and jazz drummer Antonio S√°nchez in January 2013, inviting him to compose the score for the film. His reaction to writing a soundtrack using only drums was similar to Lubezki's thoughts of shooting the movie like a single shot: \\"It was a scary proposition because I had no point of reference of how to achieve this. There's no other movie I know that has a score like this.\\" S√°nchez had also not worked on a film before, nevertheless, after receiving the script, he composed \\"rhythmic themes\\" for each of the characters. I√±√°rritu was looking for the opposite approach, however, preferring spontaneity and improvisation. S√°nchez then waited until production moved to New York before composing more, where he visited the set for a couple of days to get a better idea of the film. Following this, a week before principal photography, he and I√±√°rritu went to a studio to record some demos. During these sessions the director would first talk him through the scene, then while S√°nchez was improvising guide him by raising his hand to indicate an event such as a character opening a door or by describing the rhythm with verbal sounds. They recorded around seventy demos, which I√±√°rritu used to inform the pacing of the scenes on set, and once filming was complete, spliced them into the rough cut. S√°nchez summarized the process by saying, \\"The movie fed on the drums, and the drums fed on the imagery\\". The official soundtrack was released as a CD (77 min) in October 2014, and as an LP (69 min) in April 2015. When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences released their longlist for the Academy Award for Best Original Score in December 2014, Birdman was absent from the list. The previous day, S√°nchez received a note from the award committee explaining the decision, quoting rule fifteen of the 87th Academy Award Rules, noting \\"the fact that the film also contains over a half an hour of non-original (mostly classical) music cues that are featured very prominently in numerous pivotal moments in the film made it difficult for the committee to accept your submission\\". S√°nchez launched an appeal, and along with I√±√°rritu and the executive vice-president of Fox Music, they sent letters to Charles Fox, the chair of the Academy's music branch executive committee, asking that the committee reconsider their decision. One of the points they raised was that the committee incorrectly calculated the ratio of classical to original music, which after being clarified S√°nchez thought he was \\"on really solid ground\\". A response from Fox on December 19, however, explained that a special meeting of the music committee was held, and although its members had \\"great respect\\" for the score and considered it \\"superb\\", they thought that the classical music \\"was also used as scoring\\", \\"equally contributes to the effectiveness of the film\\", and that the musical identity of the film was created by both the drums and classical music. Ultimately, they did not overturn their decision. S√°nchez said that he and I√±√°rritu were not satisfied with the explanation. Post- production and visual effects Birdman was edited by Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione, who had both worked with the director before on 21 Grams and Babel. Stitching shots together was, of course, a crucial component of the editing, but Crise and Mirrione already had experience doing this. The director had included takes that were joined together in previous films, but in these if the editors didn't think the stitching worked they had the ability to introduce cuts. Mirrione said that in Birdman I√±√°rritu had \\"let go of that safety net\\". Because of this the editors needed to be involved in the project early on, and during principal photography Crise was on set every day. (Mirrione was busy and unable to be in New York.) Crise was not used to being on set and providing feedback, but said he was happy I√±√°rritu \\"dragged it out\\" of him, knowing that they wouldn't have much room to fix scenes later so they needed to get them right. For stitching, aside from the director, Crise also discussed strategies with Lubezki and Thompson, and techniques for gluing takes together included panning on walls and actors' bodies. The editors were used to being able to adjust the rhythm of a scene by the positioning of cuts, so without this tool used S√°nchez's music instead. The director gave the New York recordings to Crise early on to help with pacing, asking him to cut the music to the film. Still, in terms of the editing workflow, Crise described it as \\"pretty traditional\\". The editors cut the film together back in Los Angeles. A few weeks after shooting, they were quite far along the cut itself, and transitioned into visual-effects mode, where they fine-tuned the shots. The visual effects for the film were created by Montreal studio Rodeo FX. They spent four months working on the film, and according to visual effects supervisor Ara Khanikian \\"visual effects touched 90% of the frames in the movie\\". A lot of the work was subtle. For example, stitching shots together, or creating the background for the windows in the hospital scene. Many shots in the film feature mirrors, and much work was spent removing the reflections of the crew from these. To accomplish this the studio created a 2.5D digital matte painting of the reflected environment. They then rotoscoped out the parts of the mirror not containing the foreground actors and their reflections, and replaced these with the digital environment. Some of the original shots captured smudges and dirt on the mirrors, so the studio developed a way to extract them so they could paste them back into the film. A matte-painting was constructed for the night-day time lapses in the film too, created by matchmoving and reprojecting shots of the buildings it features, captured at different times of the day, together. Rodeo FX also adjusted the pace of scenes. I√±√°rritu demanded a \\"very precise rhythm and flow\\" to the film, so the studio had to re-speed much of it with timewarp curves to fit the pacing the director desired. Unlike some of the smaller adjustments though, the flying sequence required extensive preparation. I√±√°rritu spent three weeks with Halon Entertainment to previsualize the sequence. In New York, Lubezki then used the choreography of the previsualization to shoot background plates for the sequence, using a camera crane on a truck. When these were shot, Lubezki had mounted four GoPro cameras to the lens of the film camera to capture the light environment around him. Later, on a greenstage in Montreal, using a technique he had developed on Gravity, Lubezki lit Keaton with LED panels featuring high-dynamic-range images of the surrounding New York footage. The panels then realistically lit Keaton. Khanikian described the effect of the process, saying, \\"Instead of using standard lighting on greenscreen, [we were getting] the proper red bounce from the red bricks, and the same color of the sky reflected on Michael's head. It worked so well.\\" Rodeo FX then completed the final shots. The sequence was the last piece the editors inserted into the film. Mirrione commented that before the sequence was finished, they \\"had only imagined what it was going to feel like\\", but once it was completed, \\"it took the movie to this ecstatic level that absolutely blew me away\\". Sound design for the film was handled by Mart√≠n Hern√°ndez, who has worked on all the director's feature films. The production sound his team was given was \\"surprisingly perfect and clean\\", so they didn't need to spend much time tidying it. The lack of visual cuts in the film meant a departure from the usual way Hern√°ndez edited sound though. \\"Normally, Alejandro likes, as he calls it, 'the clashing of the sounds'. The camera changes angle within the scene and there is a change of everything backgrounds, texture, dialog. Obviously, that would not work on Birdman because here, everything is flowing.\\" Additionally, the sound of objects in the film needed to be coordinated with their position onscreen, a non-trivial task, since the camera was nearly always moving. Hern√°ndez also helped to cut S√°nchez's tracks, selecting and editing moments from the New York recordings against the film. When the tracks were re-recording in Los Angeles, in order \\"to have distance, and closeness and resonance\\" the team used thirty two microphones for each take. Hern√°ndez described the job as \\"crazy\\". A large challenge of the post-production soundwork was designing the sound of the theatre audience, particularly in the scene when Mike is drunk and comes out of character. I√±√°rritu knew how he wanted the audience to respond, but figuring out the sound of their reaction took four months of work from five sound designers. Hern√°ndez said he thought, for a film in general, that the narrative created by sound \\"provokes more 'explosions'\\" than that created by images, and that in Birdman, \\"Alejandro has sound exploding all throughout the film\\". The digital intermediate was completed by a team at Technicolor led by Steven Scott. They had previously collaborated with Lubezki on Gravity, but needed to approach Birdman differently because of the continuous-shot approach. According to Scott, \\"we have never done anything like it before\\". The color timing had to be done in such a way that the transitions between color-corrected environments were invisible, in contrast to a usual film where the transitions coincide with visible cuts. To do this, the team inserted their own cuts whenever the camera was stationary, and in the middle of pans and other camera movements. They then devised a way to color correct the stationary cuts and turn the moving cuts into a form of dissolve, allowing them to \\"do all these independent, crazy, complicated, color corrections that would flow organically from one to another\\". Inserting the dissolves required rotoscoping methods which the software Scott and his team were using did not have, but an enterprise agreement between Technicolor and the software's developer led to the creation of a tool Scott required. For the color timing itself, one of the priorities of the team was making the faces as dimensional and readable as possible. This required, amongst other things, that faces be highlighted, but the moving camerawork meant that the mattes used in this process had to be animated by hand. Lubezki would provide notes on the areas he wanted tracked, then the team would carry out the animations. Of the whole process, I√±√°rritu remarked that \\"everyone was out of their comfort zone\\", while Scott said it was the most challenging DI project of his career.  Analysis and themes  The director has emphasized and defended the various ambiguities intentionally included in the film: \\"At the ending of the film, [it] can be interpreted as many ways as there are seats in the theater.\\" Many aspects of film theory were debated concerning the film by critical reviews which included, among other subjects, (a) film genre; (b) intended and unresolved ambiguities of plot; and (c) the complex interaction of Riggan's personal life with his professional life as an actor. A short list of the diverse forms of film genre associated with the film has included it being referred to alternatively as a black-humor film, a mental health film, a realism/surrealism/magical realism film, a dark-humor parody film, a film of psychological realism, a failed domestic reconciliation drama, or a film concerning theatrical realism and naturalism. I√±√°rritu has maintained his penchant, well-known to followers of his previous films, for deliberately including multiple plot lines in this film which are intentionally left unresolved at the ending. Separate reviews in the press have also summarized the film as closely associated with the theme of the final tailspin of a late mid-life crisis in the life of a has-been actor seeking closure and resolution in his public and private life. The father-daughter themes in the film, portrayed through the relationship of Riggan and Samantha, were the \\"most difficult\\" and important parts of the film to depict for co-writers Dinelaris and Giacobone, as they both had similar experiences within their families involving their own relationships with their daughters. When the writers were asked about the meaning of the ambiguous ending which the director refused to comment upon, they stated that any comedic ending was completely ruled out. The writers also stated that reflections about the conclusion to the film were not directly concentrated upon Riggan or the character of Birdman as much as upon the lives of the surviving characters portrayed in the film, in particular the portrayal of Riggan's daughter Samantha. Noting the thematic pull between Riggan's insanity or actual superpowers, Travis LaCouter of First Things writes that \\"the importance of these powers real or imagined is apparent: They are for Riggan the thing beyond the labels, the kernel of his genius and, because he sees drawing upon them as selling out, the source of his great angst.\\" LaCouter concludes that \\"the quirky profundity of this film is in how it dares the viewer to consider the everyday magic that we tend to ignore, repress, or resent\\". Critics Barbara Schweizerhof and Matthew Pejkovici see the film's central theme as a satirical critique of contemporary theatrical realism, with Pejkovici laudably comparing it to Fellini's film 8¬Ω (1963). As Pejkovici states: \\"Much like Fellini's 1960[sic] classic 8¬Ω, I√±√°rritu's Birdman is a very intimate film about an artist's malaise, yet is epic, innovative, and ambitious in approach. I√±√°rritu captures the artist's battle between ambition, admiration, and celebrity with stunning scope and skill in the form of a one-take format, as his camera sweeps through the backstage corridors, across the stage, out on the busy NYC streets, and back again in breathtaking fashion.\\" Thematically, Richard Brody also compared it to Opening Night (1977) by John Cassavetes. Brody said that the actors played in \\"the sort of modern naturalism, without eccentricity of gesture, excess of expression, or heightened and formalistic precision, that is the business- casual of contemporary cinema\\". The Wall Street Journals Caryn James compared the story to that of Don Quixote (who believes himself to be a knight), as the main character believes he is a superhero (the equivalent to a knight in the 21st century). This relationship was also highlighted by the scholarly literature. Release Birdman was selected as the opening film of the 71st Venice International Film Festival along with Mohsen Makhmalbaf's new film. A limited release began in four North American theatres on October 17, 2014, followed by a nationwide release in 857 theatres on November 14, 2014. Box office Birdman grossed $42.3 million in North America and $60.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $103.2 million, against a budget of about $17 million. The film earned $424,397 during its limited North America opening in four theatres in New York and Los Angeles on the weekend of October 17, 2014, a per-theater average of $106,099, making it the 18th all- time earner (eighth among live-action movies) and ranking 20. In the second weekend of October 24, 2014, Birdman expanded to 50 theaters and earned $1.38 million, which translates to a $27,593 per-theater average. The film expanded nationwide to 857 theaters in the weekend of November 14, 2014, grossing $2,471,471, with a per theatre average of $2,884, and ranking 10. In the same weekend, Birdman grossed $11.6 million. The film opened in Mexico on November 13, 2014, grossing $628,915 in its opening weekend, and opened in the United Kingdom on January 2, 2015, grossing $2,337,407 over the weekend. In the United Kingdom, Australia, and Italy, the film grossed $7.6 million, $3.97 million, and $1.97 million, respectively. Critical response On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91%, based on 351 reviews, and an average rating of 8.50/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"A thrilling leap forward for director Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu, Birdman is an ambitious technical showcase powered by a layered story and outstanding performances from Michael Keaton and Edward Norton.\\" On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 87 out of 100, based on 58 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale. In 2015, the film was named as one of the top 50 films of the decade so far by The Guardian. Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from At the Movies praised the film's writing, direction, performances and cinematography. Stratton also described the implementation of the percussion score as \\"really exciting\\", while Pomeranz summarised: \\"It's just really beautifully written and stunningly performed and beautifully made.\\" The pair both gave the film five stars, making Birdman the only film to receive such a rating from the hosts in 2014. In The New York Times, Manohla Dargis compared the main character to Icarus, the Greek mythological figure who crashed to his death after flying too close to the sun. She also noted a reference to Susan Sontag's Against Interpretation in the dressing-room mirror. Richard Kolker compared the film to both Alfred Hitchcock's Rope (1948) and Alexander Sokurov's Russian Ark (2002). Kolker conclude that Birdman is \\"a film about acting, identity, transformation, and the mysterious effects of superheroes, (and) is filmed to create the illusion of being made in one continuous take. As with Rope, the edits are hidden, and the result is a rhythmic slide through the life of an actor in search of his self, a search doomed from the start.\\" International reception of the film was also at a high level of praise. In Germany, a film aggregate rating at EPD Film gave the film a 3.4 out of 5 rating, based on seven critiques. The German critic Barbara Schweizerhof gave the film a 4 out of 5 possible stars, complimenting the director's satirical virtuosity in making the film. In her review, Schweizerhof spoke of the film as inviting the viewer to re-watch it \\"a second and third time\\", and praised the technical achievement of representing a storyline depicting \\"the feverish stream of consciousness\\" of its main character throughout the film. The camerawork, which depicts most of the film as one continuous take, was met with extensive acclaim for its execution and usage. The acting was widely praised, particularly Keaton's, with Peter Debruge of Variety calling the performance the \\"comeback of the century\\". Debruge described the film as \\"a self-aware showbiz satire\\", and called it \\"a triumph on every creative level\\". Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph rated the film 5/5 and gave particular praise to the use of long takes by Emmanuel Lubezki, director of photography. Richard Roeper gave the film an \\"A\\" and wrote that Keaton made a serious case for an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination (which Keaton later achieved). Writing for The New Yorker, Richard Brody called the film \\"Godardian\\", comparing it to Pierrot le Fou (1965), Every Man for Himself (1980), Alphaville (1965), and Germany Year 90 Nine Zero (1991), four classic films by French director Jean- Luc Godard. However, he suggested the film fell short of reaching the same cinematic mastery, adding, \\"it's not a good idea for a filmmaker to get in the ring with Mr. Godard\\". In his critical comments on the film, he concluded that the film \\"trade[d] on facile, casual dichotomies of theatre versus cinema and art versus commerce\\" and \\"deliver[ed] a work of utterly familiar and unoriginal drama\\". In another review in The New Yorker separately supplementing the review by Brody, Anthony Lane rejected the film's suggestion that film critics are out to destroy films, explaining, \\"Someone could have told I√±√°rritu that critics, though often mean, are not preemptively so, and that anybody who'd say, as Tabitha does, 'I'm going to destroy your play', before actually seeing it, would not stay long in the job.\\" Some reviews were negative. Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair, called the film \\"hoary\\" and \\"deceptively simple\\". Scott Tobias, writing for The Dissolve, gave the film 1.5 stars. He commends Lubezki's cinematography as succeeding at \\"trapping viewers in a pressure-cooker atmosphere as Riggan and his players struggle to keep it together\\", but suggests that I√±√°rritu is \\"incapable of modulation\\", and that there exists \\"a sourness to Birdman that I√±√°rritu can't turn into wit\\".  Accolades  At the 87th Academy Awards, Birdman won four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography. Michael Keaton was nominated for Best Actor, Edward Norton and Emma Stone were nominated in Best Supporting Acting categories, and it also received nominations for Sound Editing and Sound Mixing. Keaton received his first Golden Globe Award, winning for Best Actor in a Motion Picture ‚Äì Musical or Comedy at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards. The film also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay. =Top ten lists= Birdman was listed on many critics' top ten lists. * 1st ‚Äì Anne Thompson, Indiewire * 1st ‚Äì Garry Arnot, Cinema Perspective * 1st ‚Äì Steve Persall, Tampa Bay Times * 1st ‚Äì Christy Lemire, RogerEbert.com * 1st ‚Äì Lisa Kennedy, Denver Post * 1st ‚Äì Kristopher Tapley, HitFix * 1st ‚Äì Steven Rea, The Philadelphia Inquirer * 1st ‚Äì James Verniere, Boston Herald * 2nd ‚Äì Bob Mondello, NPR * 2nd ‚Äì Rafer Guzm√°n, Newsday * 2nd ‚Äì Gregory Ellwood, HitFix * 2nd ‚Äì Peter Travers, Rolling Stone * 2nd ‚Äì Jocelyn Noveck, Associated Press * 2nd ‚Äì Ann Hornaday, The Washington Post * 2nd ‚Äì Bill Goodykoontz, Arizona Republic * 2nd ‚Äì Barbara Vancheri, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette * 2nd ‚Äì Mick LaSalle & Leba Hertz, San Francisco Chronicle * 2nd ‚Äì Jeffrey M.

The group's founding mainstays were Nic Dalton on bass guitar and vocals and Stevie Plunder (born Anthony Hayes) on guitar and vocals. The group issued three mini-albums, Trust Us (June 1988), Sarah's not Falling in Love (April 1990), and Home Movie (1992); a live album, 13.7.91 Live! Live! Live! (1991); and three albums, No Era Is Safe (1986), Half A Cow (1986), and Banana Smoothie Honey (1992). Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described their early sound as \\"a punky brand of power pop that mixed frantic guitar riffs, sharp harmonies and diamond-hard pop melodies\\" before starting to \\"explore a more tripped-out kind of psychedelic revivalism\\". In 1989 Dalton and Plunder and their drummer, Geoff Milne, formed a side project, Hippy Dribble, playing their more psychedelic songs. In December 1990 the trio also formed Captain Denim to play \\"more laid-back songs mostly ... influenced by the likes of Buffalo Springfield, Country & Western and folk rock\\". Both these groups issued material including a split album, Silver Apples/Fade in 1994. In 1992, Dalton joined US band The Lemonheads and former Plunderer's keyboard player Andy Lewis and Plunder formed The Whitlams with Tim Freedman. Plunder died on 26 January 1996, at the age of 32 years and Lewis died on 12 February 2000, at the age of 33 years. History The Plunderers formed in May 1984 in Canberra with Nic Dalton on bass guitar and vocals; Lindsay Dunbar on drums; and Stevie Plunder (born Anthony Hayes) on guitar and vocals. Dalton and Plunder had been members of Get Set Go, a folk-pop band, with Suzie and Jenny Higgie. Suzie later recalled \\"down at Commonwealth Park there used to be a tunnel with a power point ... My first band with Nic Dalton and Stevie Plunder ‚Äì we wrote most of our songs down there\\". The Plunderers' early sound was described by Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, as \\"a punky brand of power pop that mixed frantic guitar riffs, sharp harmonies and diamond-hard pop melodies\\". Dunbar soon left and the group went into hiatus for six months. In June 1985 Dalton and Plunder were joined by The Gadflys' drummer Peter Velzen, who also provided lead vocals. This line-up released their debut single, \\"Strange Affection\\" on their own label, Rattlesnake Records. It had been recorded in August with the group self-producing at Trafalgar Studios. The group moved to Melbourne in October and added Andy Lewis on keyboards, guitar and harmony vocals. They released two music cassette albums, No Era Is Safe and Half A Cow both in 1986. By the end of 1986, they relocated to Sydney and performed at inner-city venues. Andy Lewis left the band in 1987. In June 1988 they issued their debut five-track mini-album, Trust Us, which was produced by Charlie Owen (guitarist, pianist for New Christs) on the Green Fez label. They followed in November with another single, \\"I Don't Mind\\", produced by Rob Younger (ex-Radio Birdman, vocalist for New Christs). In January 1989 Pillage was replaced on drums by Geoff Milne (ex-Eastern Dark). The group issued their next single, \\"I Didn't Even See Them at All\\", in June 1989 on Citadel Records. In March the following year they issued another five-track mini-album, Sarah's not Falling in Love, which was produced by Younger. In September another single, \\"Christo\\", appeared, which was followed in July the next year by a four-track mini-album, Home Movie, produced by Younger. McFarlane noted their sound had started to \\"explore a more tripped-out kind of psychedelic revivalism\\". In 1989 Hippy Dribble was formed as a side project with Dalton as Nic Dribble, Milne as Geoff Dribble and Plunder as Stevie Dribble. Hippy Dribble played psychedelic pop and issued a four-track extended play, Wild Strawberri, in November 1990 on their own Trip Records label. The trio formed another side project, Captain Denim, in December 1990 to play \\"more laid-back songs mostly from the very early Plunderers days when they were influenced by the likes of Buffalo Springfield, Country & Western and folkrock\\". In 1991 Dalton formed Godstar, a psychedelic pop band. He continued with The Plunderers in 1992, which issued a full-length album, Banana Smoothie, Honey, on Citadel and an eight-track live album, 13.7.91 Live! Live! Live! on Club Records. In 1992, Dalton joined US band The Lemonheads and Lewis and Plunder formed The Whitlams so the band was put on a break. In 1992, Hippy Dribble released another four-track EP, Cheerleader, on Dalton's own label, Half a Cow. In April that year, Hippy Dribble resumed and issued a split album: their side is Silver Apples; while Captain Denim is on the other side with Fade; on the Half a Cow label. The material had been recorded four years earlier by the line-up of Dalton, Milne and Plunder. According to Dalton \\"Hippy Dribble were a bit more psychedelic and modern, whereas Plunderers were more of a rock band\\". After Dalton left to join the Lemonheads, Plunder joined New Christs and then formed The Whitlams with Tim Freedman and former The Plunderers' bandmate, Andy Lewis. Dalton performed in various groups, including Love Positions, The Gloomchasers and Ratcat; and also issued solo material. By 1995 Milne had joined Red Planet Rockets on drums. On 26 January (Australia Day) 1996, Stevie Plunder was found dead at the bottom of Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains, at the age of 32 years. The Plunderers would be no more after this event. On 12 February 2000 Andy Lewis died, at the age of 33 years. In November 2000 Half A Cow re-issued Banana Smoothie, Honey in a 2√ó CD format with five bonus tracks originally released by Hippy Dribble or Captain Denim. In September 2005 Dalton recalled \\"The Plunderers kept saving our songs for our first album. Stevie Plunder died and we never got to record an album ‚Äì my single biggest regret regarding music. We had all these great songs that were never recorded\\". In 2008 Dalton issued a retrospective album, Last Seen Near Trafalgar 87-89, which included original versions of early The Plunderers material.

Juan Cresp√≠ (1721‚Äì1782) in his diary during the expedition of Gaspar de Portol√† (1716‚Äì1784) in August 1769. It was five miles from the Pacific Ocean, and 600 to 900 feet in elevation. It could be seen from Interstate 405 and from the J. Paul Getty Museum. History It was owned by film director Victor Fleming (1889-1949), who used it as a horse ranch in the 1930s and 1940s. Frequent guests to Fleming's estate were Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Ingrid Bergman and Spencer Tracy. In 1959, it was purchased by Thomas V. Jones, who served as chief executive of the Northrop Corporation for thirty years, and his wife Ruth. They turned the estate into a vineyard, by planting a terraced vineyard in 1978. In 1986, they purchased additional adjacent land to expand the vineyard. In 2005, new winery facilities were built on site. In 2013, it was purchased by Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive officer of the News Corporation, after he saw an advertisement in a newspaper he owns, The Wall Street Journal.Will Colvin, Rupert Murdoch Has Just Bought A Vineyard , Business Insider Australia, May 11, 2013Rupert Murdoch Confirms Plans to Purchase Bel Air Vineyard, The Hollywood Reporter, May 10, 2013 Wines Under the brand Moraga Vineyards, it grew the following varietals of Bordeaux wine: Cabernet, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon blanc. It is grown on naturally deep gravel soil and annual rainfall of 24 inches. The first wine, the Moraga Red Table Wine, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, was made by winemaker Bruno D'Alfonso at the Sanford Winery in 1989 and sold in 1992.The wine was made by D'Alfonso until the 1992 vintage, when production shifted to the Etude facility in Napa, where Tony Soter made the wine. The first Moraga White Table Wine was produced in 1998 and released in 2000. The current winemaker is Scott Rich.He began making the wines in 1996, when he was Etude's winemaker. The wines were served at the Bel Air Bar and Grill, Bel-Air Country Club, The Beverly Hills Hotel, Patina, Spago, and Morton's The Steakhouse. They have received good reviews from wine critics Jancis Robinson and Robert M. Parker, Jr..

Discovered in 1970, the field was one of the first places where massive hydraulic fracturing was performed routinely and successfully on thousands of wells. The field now covers more than 2,000 square miles between the cities of Denver and Greeley, and includes more than 23,000 wells producing from a number of Cretaceous formations. The bulk of the field is in Weld County, but it extends into Adams, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, and Larimer Counties. Geology Stratigraphic column of the Wattenberg Gas Field. Oil and gas producing zones are in green; hydrocarbon source beds are in purple. East-West cross-section through the Denver Basin. The Wattenberg basin-centered field is shown in red. The reservoir rocks are Cretaceous sandstones, shales, and limestones deposited under marine conditions in the Western Interior Seaway. The gas and condensate is contained within Cretaceous formations in the deepest part of the Denver Basin, where the rocks were subject to enough heat and pressure to generate oil and gas from organic material in the rock. The field is a stratigraphic trap, basin- centered gas field. Most of the gas-producing formations are considered tight gas, having low natural permeability. Although the field today is in the deepest part of the basin, an unconformity at the base of the Pierre Shale shows that the field is on an early paleohigh active in the Middle Cretaceous.R.J. Weimer and S.A. Sonnenberg, ‚ÄúWattenberg field, paleostructure- stratigraphic trap, Denver Basin, Colorado,‚Äù Oil & Gas Journal, 22 Mar. 1982, p.204-210. Discovery and development Drilling in the Wattenberg Gas Field north of Denver, 2005. Although numerous wells had drilled through the Wattenberg Field over the decades, and many drillers and wellsite geologists noticed gas ‚Äúshows‚Äù (indications) in the \\"J\\" Sandstone and other strata, the \\"J\\" Sandstone and other gas-bearing formations had permeability too low to yield gas in commercial quantities. Core samples indicated the \\"J\\" Sandstone was similar to the Lower Cretaceous Dakota Sandstone reservoir in the San Juan Basin. This was supported with the Aug. 1967 discovery of the Roundup Field. Additionally, examination of outcrops and electrical logs showed the \\"J\\" Sandstone to be a delta-front sandstone. Amoco geologist Pete Matuszczak noticed that all the wells drilled over a large area recorded noncommercial gas shows, with no water, through the \\"J\\" Sandsone (also called the Muddy Sandstone) on the mudlogs, cores, and drillstem tests. He suggested that the area might be made to produce large economic quantities if the wells were treated with the new method of massive hydraulic fracturing, which Amoco was using successfully in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico.\\"Reinventing Wattenberg,\\" Oil & Gas Investor, July 2009, p.35-45. Drilling started in 1970, and wells were completed in the J Sandstone, at depths from 7350 to 8500 feet. Drilling deep gas also fortuitously found conventional oil in places in the shallower Terry and Hygiene sandstones.R.A. Matuszczak, ‚ÄúWattenberg Field, Denver Basin, Colorado,‚Äù The Mountain Geologist, July 1973, v.10 n.3 p.99-105. The D Sandstone, another conventional reservoir, also produces in limited areas within Wattenberg. Additional producing formations were added to the field. Starting in 1981, operators discovered that the Codell Sandstone would yield economic quantities of oil and gas if hydraulically fractured. Hundreds of new wells were drilled and completed in the Codell in the early 1980s; the Codell was often co-completed with the overlying Niobrara Formation. Additional wells were drilled and hydraulically fractured in the Plainview and Lytle formations, below the J Sandstone. The initial spacing of one \\"J\\" Sandstone well per 320 acres was found insufficient to drain the reservoir, so the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission approved infill wells. Gas wells in Wattenberg were drilled vertically until 2009, when operators discovered that horizontal wells drilled in the chalk of the Niobrara Formation yielded better quantities of gas and condensate, setting off a new round of drilling.Sharon Dunn, ‚ÄúColorado‚Äôs Wattenberg growing in importance in oil, gas industry,‚Äù Denver Post, 13 Aug. 2012. Production and reserves In 1973, the field was thought to contain 1.1 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas.

It now corresponds to the neighborhood of Drulovka in Kranj. Name Drulovka was mentioned in written sources in 1436 as Drwlawitz (and as Drollewckg and Drolebck in 1439, and Drullweg in 1444). It is probably derived from a personal name, borrowed in turn from the Old High German name Drullo, thus meaning 'Drullo's (village)'. The name is less likely to be derived from a Slovenian root referring, for example, to the gorge of the Sava River.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, pp. 127‚Äì128. In the past the German name was Drulouk. History Prehistoric artifacts have been found in the settlement, testifying to early habitation of the site. In 1955 and 1956, excavations were carried out at the ≈†pik promontory () in the Zarice Gorge on the Sava, revealing material from the end of the Neolithic and from the early and middle Chalcolithic. Many of the stone tools and pottery fragments belong to the Alpine facies of the Lengyel culture or the older layers of the Lasinja culture, from the first quarter of the third millennium BC. In 1987, additional studies east of the site yielded not only stone tools and weapons but also pottery from the late Bronze Age (the Urnfield culture). A bronze ax from a burial mound on the western edge of the village is also associated with this time.

By unknown (1950) The Throne Chairs of Norway (Norwegian Bokm√•l: singular Norges tronstol, plural -stoler; Norwegian Nynorsk: singular Noregs tronstol, plural -stolar) are the physical representations of the Throne of the Kingdom of Norway. One stands in the building of the Parliament in Oslo, the political capital of Norway, where it is used in a political context. The other stands in Trondheim, the religious capital of Norway, where it was used in a religious context. A lesser known is the Throne Chair in the Council Chamber in the Royal Palace. In addition to the Throne Chairs, there are two coronation chairs (Bokm√•l and Nynorsk: kroningstol), which are also located in Trondheim. Between 1671 and 1814, the Throne Chair of Denmark was de facto also Norway's.  The Throne Chair in the Parliament, Oslo  King Haakon VII took the oath in the Parliament. By Anders Beer Wilse (1905) The Throne Chair was made in 1847 by Wilhelm Heinrich Hoffmann and placed in the Throne Room in the Castle of Oslo (the Royal Palace). Later in the 19th century, the Throne Chair was transferred to the Parliament, where it has been located ever since. It is, especially, used when the King opens the Parliament every year. The Throne Chair is covered with gold, and the textile is red. These are the colours of the King. On the top of the Chair is the Coat of arms of Norway. The Chair has two crowned lion heads, and the two foremost of the Chair's legs resemble lion paws. A golden lion symbolises the King. The Throne Chair is 207 centimetres tall and 100 centimetres broad. Two smaller chairs belong together with the Throne Chair; one for the queen and one for the heir apparent.  The Throne Chair in the Royal Palace, Oslo  In the Council Chamber in the Royal Palace, where the King receives the Government every Friday, the King has an additional throne chair. This was made in the 1840s by Hans Linstow.The Royal Court: The Council Chamber There is also a slightly smaller chair made in 1997. This belongs to the heir apparent.  The Throne Chair in Trondheim  The Throne Chair in Trondheim was acquired to the coronation of Oscar II and Sophia of Nassau in 1873. The Throne Chair was used for the last time during the coronation of Haakon VII and Maud of Wales in 1906.  The Coronation Chairs  The Coronation Chairs in 1906, when Haakon VII and Maud of Wales were crowned in the Cathedral of Nidaros. By unknown (1906) In 1818, [Charles XIV John] used a pair of identical chairs; one as a coronation chair during the ceremony and one as a throne chair when he was crowned. In addition, there was a chair without arms, used by his son and heir apparent, Oscar. In 1860, however, when [Charles XV of Sweden] and Louise of the Netherlands were crowned, they used the two chairs during the ceremony whilst they, most likely, used Oscar's chair of 1818 as a throne chair when they were crowned. The 1906 coronation was the last in Norway; in 1908, the provision in the 1814 constitution mandating a coronation was repealed. However, when Olav V became king in 1958, he desired and arranged a \\"benediction\\" or blessing ceremony in the Cathedral of Nidaros. In this ceremony, the former coronation chairs were used during the service. The same happened in 1991, when Harald V and Sonja Haraldsen were blessed on their royal office.

Summary The author is both the narrator and, in an example of illeism, a central figure in the story. To begin with, \\"Norman\\" goes to Ali's training camp at Deer Lake, Pennsylvania and observes his preparations. Clearly, Ali is his hero. He meets his entourage, among them Bundini, and the sparring partners such as Larry Holmes, Eddie Jones, and Roy Williams. The next scene is in Kinshasa where President Mobutu of Zaire has underwritten the fight, a showcase of \\"Black honour\\", a victory for \\"Mobutuism\\". Ali is stationed at Nsele and getting ready. The fight, however, is postponed when Foreman incurs a cut during his training. \\"Norman\\" can go back to the United States. One month later, Mailer is back in Kinshasa, staying at the Inter-Continental hotel where most of George Foreman's people are staying as well, also the promoters, and even some of Ali's retinue. Mailer glows in the admiration of the black Americans: \\"A man of wisdom\\" (Ali), \\"the champ among writers\\" (Foreman), \\"a genius\\" (Don King). He reads \\"Bantu Philosophy\\" and learns that \\"humans (are) forces, not beings\\". Mailer meets Foreman and is startled by his reception, \\"Excuse me for not shaking hands with you, but you see I am keeping my hands in my pockets\\". Foreman works with Sandy Saddler, Dick Sadler, Archie Moore, Sugar Ray Robinson, and Terry Lee. Mailer has access to Ali's preparations at Nsele, and, on one occasion, is allowed to accompany Ali on his early morning run but not able to complete the full exercise. The encounters with various characters of the retinues fascinate Mailer. The balconies of the hotel have no railings, and on one night, after drinking with Don King, Mailer challenges himself to go on the balcony and climb around its partition to the next balcony. He ponders what could have happened, \\"How ridiculous a way to get yourself killed\\". The evening before the fight Mailer has a beer with George Plimpton, who covers the fight for Sports Illustrated before attending the press meeting of Foreman at the Hotel Memling. Then Plimpton and he set out for Ali's place to join his retinue. At 2 AM, they all leave for the stadium where the fight is scheduled to start two hours later. In Ali's dressing room, Mailer observes the mood. He describes the dynamics of the fight in detail comparing it to a chess match and to a piece of art. He notes that Angelo Dundee loosens the tightness of the ropes to allow Ali to lean back more when doing his \\"rope-a- dope\\". During the fight Foreman grows increasingly weary, allowing Ali to take control of the bout and knock him out. Mailer states that the countdown by the referee Zack Clayton was correct and went to \\"ten\\". After the fight, the tropical rain starts, the parties depart, and Mailer goes to Nsele to bid goodbye to Ali. When flying back, Mailer's plane is briefly detained at Dakar, as the jubilant crowd expects Ali to be aboard. Mailer concludes the book with an African tale. \\"The Executioner's Song\\" The title of the chapter where Ali takes control of the fight and wins is \\"The Executioner's Song\\". Mailer had used the title in one of his earlier poems, published in Fuck You magazine in September 1964, reprinted in Cannibals and Christians (1966). He reused this title later for his 1979 novel. Themes Throughout Norman Mailer's foray into sports journalism he focuses on a variety of topics both within and outside of the boxing ring.  Theatre of Boxing  The Theatre of Boxing is a major focus of The Fight. The presentation and behavior of both Muhammad Ali and George Foreman leading up to \\"The Rumble in the Jungle\\" is a major focus of the book. From the beginning of the book, Mailer analyzes the demeanor and appearances of both boxers. When discussing the famed trash talking antics of Ali, he states that they are imperative to his success in the ring, \\"If, when speaking to the press, a harsh and hysterical tone entered his voice as easily as other men light a cigarette, he was never frantic in the ring...\\"Norman Mailer, \\"Carnal Indifference\\", The Fight: Norman Mailer, by Norman Mailer, Vintage International, 1997, p. 7. Ali's antics are a focal point in the buildup to the fight for this reason as he was at his best outside of the ring. Although he seemed to be struggling during training sessions that Mailer attended, Ali was at his trash talking best from his poetry and showmanship at his Deer Lake training facility to things as simple as his post-sparring press conferences. George Foreman was portrayed as the antithesis of Ali as he was not big on the theatrics of sports entertainment and as a whole was a more subdued human being. Mailer details his first interaction with Foreman in the lobby of the Inter-Continental describing how, unlike Ali, who would have turned the interaction into a spectacle, Foreman simply kept his hands in his pockets and spoke in a soft, Texas manner. Foreman‚Äôs interactions with the press were not ones born of arrogance but from a humble perspective in which he trained to his pop music and \\"hoped\\" to knock out Ali.Norman Mailer, \\"A Gang of Champs\\", The Fight: Norman Mailer, by Norman Mailer, Vintage International, 1997, p. 44. Mailer equates this fight to a war of religion which can be taken literally or figuratively as it was Ali's Muslim beliefs that helped him criticize America vs. Foreman‚Äôs Christian beliefs that made him prideful of his country but it was also a war between Foreman‚Äôs humble approach and Ali‚Äôs crowd pleasing trash talk approach that made Ali so popular in Africa that made Mailer believe that ‚Äúif Ali can‚Äôt win in Africa, he can‚Äôt win anywhere.‚ÄùNorman Mailer, ‚ÄúA Gang of Champs,‚Äù The Fight: Norman Mailer, by Norman Mailer, Vintage International, 1997, p.47  Blackness and Mailer's battle with it  Blackness and Mailer's battle with it is an underlying theme throughout The Fight. Mailer, whether right or wrong, takes on the task of comparing the blackness of George Foreman and Muhammad Ali while also evaluating how comfortable he is navigating black spaces. This has been a theme in other works of Mailer such as The White Negro. Mailer was accepted by both camps, especially Ali's camp, so much so that Mailer got to go on a training run with Ali. This being said, Mailer feels a bit of guilt profiting off of the work of black bodies especially now when he was at the forefront of two of the biggest Black figures at the time. This was partially due to his own personal battles during a highly racialized period of history, coming out when the Civil Rights Movement and Black Power movements were still prevalent. He loved the ‚ÄúBlack soul‚Äù but he states, ‚ÄúHe no longer knew whether he loved Blacks or secretly disliked them, which had to be one of the dirtiest secrets of his American life,‚Äù as he looked for a justifiable reason to hate Black people but constantly being reminded of how much he loved Black people.Norman Mailer, ‚ÄúThe Millionaire,‚Äù The Fight: Norman Mailer, by Norman Mailer, Vintage International, 1997, p.35-44 The hate was mostly that of self-hate but through his form of self-hatred, he was able to tell a hole-filled, biased form of African-American history that discussed how American Blacks were disadvantaged because during slavery they were snatched from their heritage. Mailer constantly attempts to understand the American Black psyche as he not only compares them to themselves but to the African Blacks which he deems American Blacks have become very judgmental of. The comparison of Blackness carried over into his opinions on Foreman and Ali. Mailer believed that Foreman was ‚Äúmore Black‚Äù due to his ability to potentially be mistaken as an African himself. This observation comes after Mailer‚Äôs detailed description of Foreman‚Äôs physical build and demeanor. This evaluation was in staunch contrast to Muhammad Ali who he states had to have some ‚Äúwhite blood‚Äù in him due to his personality, in Mailer‚Äôs opinion, being reminiscent of a Southern college fraternity president. ‚ÄúAli was like nothing so much as a white actor who had put on too little make up for the part and was not wholly convincing as a Black,‚Äù Mailer states in his typical problematic fashion.Norman Mailer, ‚ÄúA Gang of Champs,‚Äù The Fight: Norman Mailer, by Norman Mailer, Vintage International, 1997, p.47 Remarks like these hang over the narrative of the book as the reader is left to interpret whether Mailer is racist while also getting to know both fighters through a racialized lens.  Bantu philosophy  Bantu philosophy is a theme Mailer weaves into The Fight by connecting aspects and events from ‚ÄúThe Rumble in the Jungle‚Äù to this ancient philosophy founded by a Dutch missionary in the Belgian Congo. Mailer comes across the text after a visit to the University Place Book Shop in New York, where he wanted to learn a little bit more about Africa before he returned to Zaire to cover the fight. Bantu Philosophy was a book written by Father Tempels who was a Dutch priest who had worked as a missionary in the Belgian Congo and extracted the philosophy from the language of the tribes he lived with. Norman Mailer, ‚ÄúThe Millionare,‚Äù The Fight: Norman Mailer, by Norman Mailer, Vintage International, 1997, 38 Mailer in his reading comes to discover that the African Buntu philosophy of African tribesman was similar to his own personal philosophy, ‚ÄúBantu Philosophy, he soon learned, saw humans as forces, not beings. Without putting it into words, he always believed that.‚Äù Norman Mailer, ‚ÄúThe Millionare,‚Äù The Fight: Norman Mailer, by Norman Mailer, Vintage International, 1997, 38 Once Mailer gained a better understanding of Bantu philosophy he began describing Foreman and Ali not as fighters but as forces. Mailer commits to the philosophy of boxers as forces stating, ‚ÄúHumans were not beings but forces. He would try to look at them [Ali and Foreman] by that light.‚Äù Norman Mailer, ‚ÄúThe Millionare,‚Äù The Fight: Norman Mailer, by Norman Mailer, Vintage International, 1997, 43 Mailer continues to use this Buntu philosophy of force to describe the fighters by introducing n‚Äôgolo, which is Congolese for force. Mailer describes n‚Äôgolo (force) as, ‚ÄúEqually could it be applied to ego, status, strength, or libido. Indubitably did Ali feel deprived of his rightful share.‚Äù Norman Mailer, ‚ÄúOur Black Kissinger,‚Äù The Fight: Norman Mailer, by Norman Mailer, Vintage International, 1997, 75 Mailer used n‚Äôgolo (force) demonstrating that Ali was deprived of this vast force that comes with being a champion.This fight however gave Ali a chance to regain the n‚Äôgolo (force) that was currently consumed by Foreman as the champion. For example Mailer also used Bantu philosophy describing Drew Bundini Brown, an assistant trainer and cornerman for Ali: ‚ÄúBundini was the walking definition of the idea that each human is born with two souls‚Ä¶ If Africans did not have this concept, one would have to invent it. What a clash of Nomo and n‚Äôgolo. All that spirit and all that prick.‚Äù Norman Mailer, ‚ÄúKing of the Flunkies,‚Äù The Fight: Norman Mailer, by Norman Mailer, Vintage International, 1997, 130 Mailer‚Äôs use of Bantu philosophy to describe Bundini as a character that holds tremendous n‚Äôgolo(force) as Ali‚Äôs assistant trainer and cornerman, which has turned him into a ‚Äúprick‚Äù. That is why Mailer uses the analogy of two souls to show the Nomo (spirit) Bundini had was being consumed by the n‚Äôgolo (force) that comes with being assistant trainer and conerman to Ali. Mailer again uses Bantu Philosophy by titling the second section of his novel n‚Äôgolo (force). In the remaining chapters Mailer depicts the historic Ali vs. Foreman Rumble in the Jungle with round by round depictions of the boxers punches and movements in the ring. Mailer again incorporates Buntu Philosophy by depicting Foreman‚Äôs demeanor in the latter rounds, ‚ÄúSomething may have finally begun to go from Foreman‚Äôs n‚Äôgolo, some departure of the essence of absolute rage, and Ali reaching over the barrage would give a prod now and again‚Ä¶‚Äù Norman Mailer, ‚ÄúThe Man in the Rigging,‚Äù The Fight: Norman Mailer, by Norman Mailer, Vintage International, 1997, 197 Here specifically but throughout the second section of the novel he depicts the battle between Ali‚Äôs n‚Äôgolo (force) and Foreman‚Äôs n‚Äôgolo (force). After the fight Mailer again uses Buntu Philosophy to describe the city of Zaire as he searches for transportation back to his hotel. Mailer writes ‚ÄúThe damp air on this dawn is full of the n‚Äôgolo of the living and the thirst of the dead.‚Äù Norman Mailer, ‚ÄúThe Executioner‚Äôs Song,‚Äù The Fight: Norman Mailer, by Norman Mailer, Vintage International, 1997, 216 Mailer wrote statements like these throughout The Fight and they demonstrate a theme of African philosophy which offers more understanding and background to one of the greatest boxing events ever held. Critical reception Mailer, who sometimes boxed, himself, had been sent to Kinshasa and was part of the press corps. This and his personal connections gave him a unique access to the event. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt indicates that Mailer recalls the drama of the fight in a \\"exquisitely refined and attenuated\\" manner. We get to know, through Mailer's interactions, \\"the principals: Muhammad Ali himself, who comes across in these pages as a far more interesting and complex man than one would divine from seeing the interesting and complex public image; and George Foreman the champion, who is simply likable and terrifying.\\" He commends Mailer for being able to describe the \\"pugilistic drama fully as exciting as the reality on which it is based.\\" Michael Wood believes that \\"every page of the book ‚Ä¶ speaks implicitly of Mailer's dislike of blacks, converted into fascination and even affection by an act of sheer liberal will\\". A critical aspect of the book is that the writer puts himself right in the middle of it, or as he says: \\"Now our man of wisdom had a vice. He wrote about himself. Not only would he describe the events he saw, but his own small effect on events. This irritated critics. They spoke of ego trips and the unattractive dimensions of his narcissism.\\" Mitrosilis comments that \\"Mailer observes the power and frailty of his own persona just as he does with the fighters and their cornermen‚Ä¶ hiding nothing.\\" To him it appears like \\"a near impossible task to lie on the couch and sit in the chair, the psychologist and the patient.\\" References Category:1995 non-fiction books Category:Books about Muhammad Ali Category:Boxing books Category:Non-fiction books by Norman Mailer ","title":"The Fight (book)"},{"id":"39365084","text":"Depot Glacier may refer to: *Depot Glacier (Antarctica) *Depot Glacier (Washington), in North Cascades National Park, Washington, USA ","title":"Depot Glacier"},{"id":"39365088","text":"Edna Luby (October 12, 1884 ‚Äì October 1, 1928) was an American actress and comedian.

The school merged with New Toronto Secondary School to form Lakeshore Collegiate Institute in 1983. The portion of the Alderwood property was transferred to the TDSB's realtor arm, Toronto Lands Corporation (TLC) in 2011 and sold to Urbancorp, a housing developer in August 2012. History Origins In 1952, the Etobicoke Board of Education had originally intended a middle school in the present site. With overcrowding at Royal York Collegiate Institute, the board decided to purchase the 15.87 acre Shields Site for $148,000. The northern portion would be then used for Douglas Park Junior School which opened in 1956. Gordon S. Adamson and Associates were commissioned as architects for the Alderwood project. Construction began in July 30, 1954, but the flooding from Hurricane Hazel caused an delay. The school was opened on September 6, 1955, to the first 340 students with the official opening ceremony November 1955. With increasing population, four classrooms, a science lab, a commercial room, a new auditorium and enlarged cafeteria were added in 1960. Alderwood had its amazing athletic program such as football, cross country, wrestling, basketball, and more. Closure and onwards In September 1980, New Toronto Secondary School, Royal York Collegiate Institute (now Etobicoke School of the Arts), and Alderwood underwent a review due to low enrollment as many catholic immigrants who arrived in the area transferred their children to the separate school system when full separate school funding commenced. As a consequence, on June 24, 1981, the Etobicoke Board approved the closure of Alderwood and New Toronto whose students were combined into the newly renamed Lakeshore Collegiate Institute on June 25, 1983, with the afternoon closing ceremonies. Since the merger of Etobicoke's first catholic high school, Michael Power/St. Joseph High School in 1982, the main campus suffered overcrowding resulting the Alderwood building being leased to the Metropolitan Separate School Board (later the Toronto Catholic District School Board) from the Etobicoke Board of Education. It was reopened as the south campus of Michael Power/St. Joseph. In September 1986, Father John Redmond Catholic Secondary School was established. The school later moved to a new building in New Toronto's large former Mimico Lunatic Asylum grounds in 2006 after its buildings were deteriorated. Val Homes Alderwood Collegiate's buildings remained empty for five years. In 2011, however, the TDSB transferred the vacant Alderwood's 8.5 acres portion of the original 14.1 acre site to the Toronto Lands Corporation (TLC) for sale.Dispostion of Alderwood CI - TCDSB TLC sold the portion to a townhouse developer, Urbancorp in August 2012.http://www.insidetoronto.com/news- story/1309526-townhome-developer-purchases-alderwood-ci-site/ After much community consultations, Alderwood's school facilities were demolished in November 2014 with the property being converted to an residential complex known as Val Homes. Subsequently, Urbancorp filed for the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act. Couple years after, Mattamy Homes took over the 92-unit residential project with a combined of detached and semi-detached.

It is a Michigan State Historic Site and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It has been operated as a museum since 1970. History Daniel Sears Mann married Ellen E. Keeler in 1873. The couple lived on a farm outside of Concord. They had three children, one of whom died young. By the 1880s, the Manns felt that a house in town would be advantageous, so that their daughters, Jessie Ellen and Mary Ida, could attend school in Concord. They purchased property, and constructed this house 1883 through 1884. As the girls grew older, the house became a social center of the town. Jessie Ellen Mann received a degree from the University of Michigan in 1906, and afterward taught mathematics, primarily in the Battle Creek schools. She remained living in the house. Around the turn of the century, Mary Ida went to the Philippine Islands as a teacher, and there married. She moved to various locations in the United States with her husband, but often visited Concord. When he died in 1942, Mary Ida moved back to her childhood home. In 1947, a modern kitchen was installed in the rear of the home. The sisters continued to live in the house until their deaths, Mary Ida died in 1959; Jessie Ellen lived in the house until she died in 1969. Their wills bequeathed the house to the people of Michigan. The Michigan Historical Center has operated it as a museum since 1970. The house was named a Michigan State Historic Site on June 18, 1970, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1970. The house is representative of 1880s middle-class household architecture. Design The mostly rectangular frame house was designed in the Late Victorian style. The walls are covered in clapboard siding. Above the entrance, at one corner, stands a pyramidal tower. The roof is a cross-gable with a small amount of Eastlake Style trim on the vergeboards, front door, porch and gablets. A carriage house is located behind the house. There are three entrances to the house with porches. On the interior, the original floor had an entrance hall, parlor, sitting room, dining room, bedroom, kitchen, pantry, and wood-shed on the first floor, and five bedrooms on the second floor. The 1947 renovation added a kitchen in the first floor, and the woodshed was turned into a laundry room. The interior houses most of the original furnishings and household implements. The ceilings are plaster and there is a marbleized slate fireplace inside.

Career Meredith attended Brigham Young University, and also worked with one of his professors, Adrian Pulfer, in a graphic design studio in Salt Lake City. In 1997, David relocated to New York, and worked as an assistant to photographers Hans Gissinger and Rodney Smith. He then went to work for Susan Slover Associates as a graphic designer. After about a year, he was offered a position as a designer for Robert Valentine, where he helped design the launch issues of Real Simple. He also photographed for clients, including Interface and Barbara Barry. Eventually, a co-worker at Valentine left to become an art director for Aveda, and hired David to shoot for the company. Meredith left Robert Valentine and worked as an independent photographer and designer. It was during this time that David was invited by Gale Towey, the creative director at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, to help redesign the logo and overall photography of the Martha Stewart Living magazine. Soon afterwards, David founded the design firm Pilot NY, and photographed for design clients, building his photography portfolio. Book design has been his most award- winning work, especially designing for fellow photographers Rodney Smith and Andrew Zuckerman. Most recently, Meredith partnered with Barbara Barry to publish Around Beauty. He designed the book and took all of its photographs. In 2014, Meredith was juror for the 2012 Communication Arts Photography Annual. Meredith's design clients include Apple, McGuire/Kohler, Henredon, Barbara Barry, and Anthropologie. As a photographer, he is represented by Cornelia Adams, and clients include Aveda, Anthropologie, Target, Nike, Ralph Lauren, Real Simple, and Martha Stewart. Meredith is an adjunct professor at Brigham Young University, teaching design and photography. He currently resides in both New York City and Utah.

The Payagu√° were a river tribe, living, hunting, fishing, and raiding on the Paraguay River. The name Payagu√° was given to them by the Guaran√≠, their enemies whom they nearly constantly fought. It is possible that the name of the Paraguay River, and thus the country Paraguay itself, comes from this; the Guaran√≠ told the Spanish that the river was the \\"Payagu√°-√Ω\\", or \\"river of Payagu√°s.\\" The name they called themselves was probably Evuev√≠, \\"people of the river\\" or \\"water people.\\" The Payagu√° were also known to early Spanish explorers as \\"Agaces\\" and spelling variations of that name.Ganson, Barbara (2017), \\"The Evuev√≠ of Paraguay: Adaptive Strategies and Responses to Colonialism\\", The Americas, Vol 74, Issue 52, p. 466. Downloaded from Project Muse. The Payagua language is extinct; they spoke a Guaycuruan language. No people remain who identify as Payagu√°; the descendants of the tribe merged with other Paraguayans, either as mestizos or with other peoples, commonly called Indians. The Payagu√° were noted for their ferocity and their skill navigating the Paraguay River in their large dugout canoes. They were a serious threat to Spanish and Portuguese travel on the river from the early 16th until the late 18th century. History Chief of the Payagu√° Indians The Payagu√°, inhabited the islands and shores of the Paraguay River, mostly north of the city of Asunci√≥n, but their travels took them as far north as the present-day city of Cuiab√°, Brazil and as far south as present-day Argentina, a distance of .Ganson, p. 465 They were an exception to the horse culture, in full flower by 1650, of other Guaycuruans. The Payagua plied the river in canoes, fished and gathered edible plants, and raided their agricultural neighbors, the Guaran√≠, to the east. Fear of the Payagu√° drove the Guarani into the arms of the Spanish, a factor leading to the establishment among the Guarani of Roman Catholic missions, including the famous Jesuit reductions in Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil.Saeger, James Schofield (2008), \\"Warfare, Reorganization, and Readaptation at the Margins of Spanish Rule--the Chaco and Paraguay,\\" The Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas, Vol 3, South America, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 263 The Payagu√° population at time of first contact with Europeans in the 16th and early 17th century has been variously estimated as between 6,000 and 24,000. As with most Indian peoples, their numbers declined due to the introduction of European diseases and by 1602 the Spanish were speaking of their diminished numbers.Ganson, p. 468 Diminished numbers notwithstanding, the Payagu√° menaced Spanish travel on the Paraguay river for more than 200 years.Saegar, James Schofield (2000), The Chaco Mission Frontier: The Guaycuruan Experience, Tucson: University of Arizona Press, pp. 18-19. The first European to come into contact with the Payagu√° may have been the castaway and explorer Aleixo Garcia. Garcia was killed in 1525 near the Paraguay river, possibly by the Payagu√°. Garc√≠a Aldonate, Mario (1994). ...Y resultaron humanos: fin de las culturas nativas en territorio argentino. Compa√±√≠a Literaria, pp. 39, 88. In 1527, the explorer Sebastian Cabot fought a river battle against Payagu√°s near the junction of the Paraguay and Bermejo River in present day Argentina. The Payagu√° force was estimated by a later Spanish chronicler to have numbered 300 canoes (probably an exaggeration as Payagu√° canoes typically transported about 10 men). In 1537, the Payagu√° killed Juan de Avalos and 80 Spaniards at a fortress the Spanish had erected, probably near present-day Fuerte Olimpo, Paraguay.Gott, Richard (1993), Land Without Evil: Utopian Journeys across the South American WatershedLondon: Verso, p. 81-82. Lest the Payagu√° be considered the sole initiator of these conflicts, European expeditions to the Americans routinely demanded food, shelter, women, and porters of native peoples.. War with the Portuguese. The Payagu√° were roughly divided into two groups; a northern branch was loosely aligned with the Kadiweu people (a band of the Mbay√° people). They resisted the Portuguese in Brazil, especially after the discovery of gold near Cuaib√° in 1718 initiated a gold rush by Portuguese wealth seekers who mostly arrived by canoe on the Paraguay River.Goodman, Edward Julius (1972), The Explorers of South America, Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pp.134-136 The Payagua resisted the intrusion by attacking the gold-seekers on the river. Most notably, in 1725 they annihilated a party of 200 men on the river. In 1730, 800 Payagu√° warriors killed most of a party of 400. They traded the proceeds of their raids, including gold, to the Spanish in Asunci√≥n for iron tools. Reprisals against the Payagu√° were ineffective until 1734, when the Portuguese scored a victory, but the next year the Payagu√° destroyed a convoy of 50 canoes (perhaps 500 men). Afterwards, the Payagu√° attacks continued, but on a lesser scale.Hemming, John (1978), Red Gold: The Conquest of the Brazilian Indians, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, pp. 395-401 The northern bands of the Payagua made peace with the Portuguese in 1752 and in 1766 some of the northerners requested to take up residence near the Jesuit reduction at Bel√©n, Paraguay. However, a few of them continuing raiding until 1789.Saegar (2008), p. 264; Ganson 481-482. War with the Spanish. Contact with the Spanish with the southern branch of the Payagu√° was divided by Barbara Ganson into two periods: 1528-1730, sporadic, hostile contact; and 1730-1811, extensive contact and accommodation by the Payagua to the Spanish. During the 17th century, the Payagu√°, described as \\"river pirates\\", menaced the commerce of the yerba mate trade on the Paraguay River, forcing much of the trade to go overland. The Payagu√° along with their allies, the Mbay√°, also carried out murderous raids to obtain horses, cattle, and other goods from Spanish settlements and Jesuit reductions. The Spanish on their part declared in 1613 a \\"war of fire and blood\\" against the Payagu√° and Mbay√° and sent out numerous expeditions to attempt to kill or enslave them.Ganson, p. 464, 472-478 Decline. By the early 18th century, the southern Payagu√° were being overwhelmed by the Spanish. In 1730, the Spanish changed their policy of \\"fire and blood\\" to one of fostering friendly relations and trade with the Payagu√°. By the 1740s some of the Payagua were engaged in supplying the Spanish settlers and cities with fish caught in the river. The Payagu√° continued to resist adopting Christianity; in 1791 only two among them had become Christians, but a large scale baptism of Payagu√° took place in 1792. A 1793 report described the Payagu√° as \\"docile, noble, dedicated to working, subordinated to their superiors, and other good qualities.\\" In the 19th century, the Payagu√° became the river police of Paraguay, employed by the government to patrol the rivers and prevent people and goods from entering the country illegally. During the Paraguayan War (1864-1870) the Payagu√° were organized by the Paraguayan government into a \\"Payagu√° regiment\\",Foote, Nicola, Horst, Harder, D. Rene (2010), \\"Military Struggle and Identity Formation in Latin America,\\" Gainesville: University Press of Florida, p. 160. Downloaded from Project Muse. and transported wood and other supplies by barge from Asunci√≥n to more northerly cities. With their numbers already in decline due to disease, alcoholism, intermarriage, and integration, the war was a demographic disaster for the Payagu√° as well as other Paraguayans.Ganson, pp. 480-486 In 1896, the Encyclopaedia Britannica reported that a \\"subdued remnant\\" of the Payagua lived in the Pilcomayo River delta, near Asunci√≥n.Encyclopaedia Britannica, Vol 2., 1896, p. 62 The last known Payagu√°, Maria Dominga Miranda, died in 1942.Ganson, p. 486. Culture The chronicler Ulrich Schmidl described an encounter with the southern Payagu√° in 1536: > \\"We arrived at a nation called Aigeiss [Payagu√°]. They have fish and meat. > Both sexes are tall and well-formed. The women are pretty. They paint their > bodies and cover their private parts. When we arrived they were in order of > battle and ready to fight us on land and water. We fought and killed many of > them. They killed 15 of our men. God gives favor to all. These Aigeiss are > good fighters, the best of all on water, not so good on land. With time to > do so, they had made their women and children flee and had hidden their food > and possessions.

He worked as a manager of equipment of the F√ºrstlich Salm'sche Eisenwerke (\\"Princely Salm's Ironworks\\") by (17761836) in Moravia. From 1816 on, he served as a professor of mechanical technology at the Polytechnic Institute in Vienna. He published scientific articles in the field of mechanics in Gilbert's Annalen der Physik as well as in the Annals of the Polytechnic Institute in Vienna.NDB/ADB Deutsche Biographie Arzberger was a pioneer of urban street lighting -- with Johann Joseph von Prechtl (1778-1854), he developed a coal gas production plant for illumination purposes at the institute. In 1818, there were 25 operational public gas lanterns in Vienna. In 1820, he invented an early steam carriage designed for travel on ordinary roads without the need of rails. On weekends and national holidays, he gave lectures free of charge.Biography @ aeiou EncyclopediaAustria Forum (biography) Career Johann Arzberger was director of the Royal Salm'sche iron works of Hugo Altgraf Franz of Salm-Reifferscheidt (1776‚Äì1836) in Moravia. In 1815 he was invited by the founder of the Imperial Polytechnic Institute (now the Technical University of Vienna) Johann Joseph Prechtl (1778-1854) to apply for the professorship for skilled mechanics and client machines. On 3 January 1816 Arzberger was awarded the Magisterium of practical teaching machines, in March of that year he took over the chair and the following November began lecturing.Bauer: Feuilleton. Johann Arzberger, S. 3. In 1816 Arzberger constructed the first major facility for the production of illuminating gas from coal with Prechtl in Vienna and thus was a pioneer of urban street lighting. Vienna was the first city on the European continent that brought coal gas for lighting streets and public places on a large scale. As a result of his work on steam power, Arzberger found a practical use for implementing a steam-powered carriage in 1820, which could move on ordinary roads without rails or any guidance. The boiler tube used in this case had already been introduced in 1816 at the Vienna Polytechnic.Bauer: Feuilleton. Johann Arzberger, S. 5. His fame and popularity among artists and artisans led him to comply with a request to establish free Sunday lectures on mechanical objects. This was so widely popular that it soon was copied by millwrights, carpenters, and masons, and supported as early the principle of \\"preparation courses\\" (non-profit training schools).Bauer: Feuilleton. Johann Arzberger, S. 6.Bauer: Feuilleton. Johann Arzberger, S. 4. Marriage Arzberger married Magdalena Holzmann in 1817, through the connection from a relative, Ernestine. However this marriage ended in 1825 with Magdalena's death. On 3 April 1826 Arzberger married Wilhelmina Josepha von Schwind, Moritz von Schwind's sister, and fathered Moritz ( 1827-1892 ), Friedrich ( * 1833, ‚Ä† 1905 in Rindbach at Ebensee ), and Auguste.Erfinder der gleichnamigen Seeleuchte. ‚Äì Siehe: Death Johann Arzberger died on 28 December 1835 on the Wieden No. 54 (Paniglgasse) of apoplexy. He was buried in the cemetery beyond Matzleinsdorf. Honors In 1907 in Hernals (Vienna's 17th district) a street was named the Arzbergergasse in memory of the founder of the Imperial Polytechnic Institute.

The protests were organized by the Islamist pressure group, Hefazat-e Islam, who were demanding the enactment of a blasphemy law. The government responded to the protests by cracking down on the protesters using a combined force drawn from the police, Rapid Action Battalion and paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh to drive the protesters out of Shapla Square. Following the events at Motijheel, protests in other parts of the country also broke out, during which 27 people died, although different sources report casualty numbers ranging from 20 to 61. The opposition party BNP initially claimed thousands of Hefazat activists were killed during the operation, but this was disputed by the government. Human Rights Watch and other human rights organizations put the total death toll at above 50, but rights groups have termed the events as a massacre. Initial attempts to dispute the chain of events were thwarted due to the government closure of two television channels, Diganta Television and Islamic TV, which were live telecasting the operation. Background  13 point demand  In early 2013, Hefajat-e Islam emerged as a pressure group composed of madrassah teachers and students, led by Shah Ahmad Shafi, rector of Hathazari Madrasah. The group became particularly active after allegations surfaced that some protesters in the Shahbag protests were involved in the publishing of content offensive to Muslims on blogs, including the depiction of Muhammad as a pornographic character. On 6 April 2013, its supporters made a long-march to promote their 13-point charter, which included: * Restoration the phrase \\"Complete faith and trust in the Almighty Allah\\" in the constitution * Enact a blasphemy law; * Taking measures for punishment of \\"atheist bloggers,\\" who led the Shahbagh movement, and anti-Islam activists who made \\"derogatory remarks\\" against the Muhammad. * Stopping \\"infiltration of all 'alien-culture', in the name of individual‚Äôs freedom of expression, including free mixing of male and female\\" and candle lighting. Stopping harassment of women, open fornication and adultery, sexual harassment, all forms of violence against women and an end to the tradition of dowry; * Make Islamic education mandatory from primary to higher secondary levels, cancelling the women's, and anti-religion, education policy. * Declaration of Ahmadiyyas as non-Muslim. * Stopping the setting up of sculptures at intersections, schools, colleges and universities across the country. * Lifting restrictions on prayers for ulema in all mosques across the country, including Baitul Mokarram National Mosque; * Stopping Islamophobic content in media; * Stopping anti-Islam activities by NGOs in the Chittagong Hill Tracts; Hefazat fears a \\"foreign conspiracy\\" to make a separate Christian state in that area; * Stop the extrajudicial killing of ulema; * Stopping the harassment of teachers and students of Qawmi madrassas and ulema; * Release of all ulema, and madrassa students, that had been arrested and the withdrawal of all cases filed against them, compensation for the victims, and bringing the assailants to justice. The government responded by saying that it had \\"already met\\" many of the group's demands. This included the arrest of four bloggers for making derogatory comments against the Muhammad.  Human Rights Watch warning  On 3 May 2013, Human Rights Watch issued warnings, based on information obtained from diplomatic missions regarding an imminent government crackdown, to security forces against committing excesses in the planned upcoming protests. It also urged the government to appoint an independent commission to investigate the killing of civilians since February, and prosecute those responsible for unlawful killings and use of force.  Protests   5 May  Hefazat-e-Islam organized a protest on 5 May demanding a trial of \\"atheist bloggers\\", and new legislation for the punishment for blasphemy. On 5 May 2013, Hefazat activists blockaded all six entrance routes to Dhaka from dawn. At noon, with the permission of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP), activists entered Dhaka and started moving towards Baitul Mukarram Mosque to attend a prayer service. However, activists of Hefazat-e- Islam were attacked en route by armed Awami League activists, who were using the Gulistan Road to reach Shapla Square. In self defense, Hefazat activists counterattacked with bricks. During the clashes, two television journalists were injured, apparently by Hefazat protesters. At about 3:00 pm, while Hefazat leaders were delivering speeches, the Secretary General of the Awami League, Sayed Ashraful Islam, demanded, via press conference, that they leave Dhaka. The opposition party Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) countered by asserting that Hefazat members had a democratic right to assemble and articulate their cause. During the unrest, Hefazat protesters allegedly attacked the offices of the Communist Party of Bangladesh's at Motijheel. Hefazat claimed that their workers were unarmed and had come under attack by police and Bangladesh Chhatra League activists at Gulistan, Purana Paltan and Baitul Mukarram, and in front of the Communist Party offices. Hefazat supporters reportedly vandalized at least 50 vehicles and several buildings during their rally. They violently attacked others in front of the Awami League headquarter at Paltan, Dhaka, and allegedly set fire to a number of book stores near the Baitul Mukarram mosque.  6 May  By nightfall, many of the demonstrators had left the city, but about 50,000- 70,000 still remained in Shapla Square. There, they held prayers and were addressed by their leaders. At around 2.15 am on 6 May, security forces cut power to the area. At 2:30 a.m. about 5000 members of the security forces launched \\"Operation Shapla\\", or \\"Operation Flash Out\\", to remove them. The forces included members of the Bangladesh Police, RAB, and BGB. At first they first used megaphones, asking the protesters to leave the area peacefully. Then, moving in from three directions via Dainik Bangla, Fakirapool and Bangladesh Bank intersection, security forces used tear gas, rubber bullets, and sound grenades to disperse the demonstrators. Most fled the area, but others hid in side streets and buildings, where they were shot down by security forces. Hefazat alleges that the bodies were then picked up by garbage trucks and dumped outside the city. Ahmad Shafi was escorted away from a madrassa in Dhaka and flown to Chittagong. Police insisted he was not arrested but was leaving voluntarily. On the following morning, the protests spread across the country. In Narayanganj, students and teachers of a local madrasa held protests and blockaded the Dhaka-Chittagong highway. In return, police fired on the protesters, killing 27. In Hathazari Upazila, six people were shot dead by police, while in Bagerhat, a Hefazat member died in a clash between protesters and police. Casualties According to government estimates, the number of casualties in this operation was 11, including a few law enforcement members, while the Daily Star reported 5 deaths. Opposition parties initially claimed that 2000- 3000 of protesters had been killed, while Hefazat claimed about 1000 deaths. Human Rights Watch disagreed with Hefazat's claims, but agrees that a massacre took place. > ‚Äú(the security forces) shot live ammunition and rubber bullets into unarmed > crowds, conducted sweeping arrests, and used other forms of excessive force > during and after protests that began in February and continue... opened fire > on crowds, often without warning...\\" Some victims were bystanders, including a number of shopkeepers near the Baitul Mukarram, while most were Hefazat supporters, including children, who were killed by a blow to the head or gunshot wounds. Doctors at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital confirmed that many of those dead had been shot in the head. One policeman was also attacked in reprisal. According to Human Rights Watch, eyewitnesses saw 25-30 bodies that were confirmed dead. This included British activist and journalist David Bergman, who saw 24 bodies. The Guardian reported 22 confirmed deaths, while an investigation conducted by Aljazeera revealed that 14 bodies of \\"bearded men\\" with gunshot wounds were buried, after the protests, at Dhaka's state-run cemetery. Human rights group Odhikar reported 61 deaths, but refused to reveal the names of the victims out of security concerns for their families. The UK Home Office estimates a total of no fewer than total of 50 deaths. Many individuals, including orphan children, were missing, which may have contributed to the discrepancies in casualties. Because of the differing views, Human Rights Watch called for an independent body to investigate the protest deaths. Amnesty International demanded that Bangladesh government set up an independent and impartial investigation immediately to look into police excesses.  Censorship  Diganta TV and Islamic TV channel were broadcasting live footage of the raid on Motijheel when they were forced off-air on the dawn of 6 May. Diganta Television's chief reporter M. Kamruzzaman said that around 25 plain-clothed policemen and an official from the broadcast commission had entered their studios without warning. According to the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC), the channels' reporting on raid on Hefazat-e- Islam Bangladesh contained \\"exaggerated things, (had) given misinformation and called for breaking the law and attacking the law enforcers.\\" Critics have accused the Sheikh Hasina government of using the Islamist issue to silence dissidents. Reactions Domestic =Government= In response to the massacre allegations, police claimed the operation resulted in ‚Äúzero casualty‚Äù while 14 party leaders claimed it to be \\"bloodless.\\" Bangladeshi foreign minister Dipu Moni downplayed reports of inaccuracy in government figures and added that \\"most of the people in the country doesn't even think that there was any controversy with the matter.\\" On 19 June, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina rejected the allegations, stating in Parliament > ... and that day's event was fully televised, you have seen how they have > rubbed red dye onto their bodies and when police came and called them they > got up and ran away ... we saw that dead bodies made a run for it! This kind > of drama has been made there.Parliamentary speech of Sheikh Hasina 19 June > 2013 \\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoucAYQlQIc\\" She also blamed the attack on her arch rival Khaleda Zia, claiming: ‚ÄúShe (Khaleda) is the instigator, she is the issuer of order.‚Äù Awami League politicians blamed Qamrul Islam BNP, Jamaat and ISI of backing the protests. Hefazat was also criticized for bringing minors, who were also attacked by law enforcement agencies during the operation, to the protests. The government, and the media, were accused of dehumanising the protesters. = Opposition = The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party compared the attacks to the Pakistani crackdown on 25 March and Jalianwala Bagh massacres. BNP leader MK Anwar called it a \\"disastrous killing.\\" In response, Detective Branch police raided the houses of city BNP convener Sadeque Hossain Khoka and Bangladesh Jatiya Party chairman Andaleeve Rahman Partha. = Hefazat-e-Islam = While some Hefzat activists vowed \\"revenge\\" after the killings, Hefazat amir Shah Ahmad Shafi appealed for calm and called a general strike all over Bangladesh on 12 May 2013. =Others= On 10 June 2013, human rights group Odhikar, published a fact finding report claiming 61 deaths, but refused to provide any names of the victims report, citing security concerns for the families of the victims. The Ain O Shalish Kendro demanded impartial investigation \\"to deal with them (Hefazat-e-Islam) more strategically and responsibly.\\" International UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon voiced concern over the killing of unarmed protesters in Bangladesh and requested the government to sit with religious and political leaders. US ambassador, Dan Mozena, has cautioned that all groups and individuals have rights to protest.  Lawsuits  The government filed 12 cases against Hefazat-e Islam leaders for murder, vandalism, arson and destruction of properties and other charges. Hefazat denies the charges. On 27 June, Martin F. McMahon & Associates, a US law firm representing two US-based organisations, Human Rights and Development for Bangladesh and Bangladeshi-Americans in Greater Washington DC filed cases in the International Criminal Court against 25 Bangladeshi ministers and security officials, including Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for alleged \\"torture, forced disappearance, extrajudicial executions and mass killings\\", Ahmed Ziauddin, a Brussels based Bangladeshi lawyer who was accused of influencing the proceedings of Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal at the instruction of Bangladesh government, stated- \\"I am not sure about the objective of it and I am sure those Washington-based organisations have some political motives. They may have been trying to create political hype since filing a complaint in the ICC does not mean proceedings of a case will start immediately\\" On 10 August, Police raided the office of Odhikar and arrested its general secretary Adilur Rahman Khan. In a press briefing Police said they found the list of 61 deaths and released it to the media. In a press statement, the US Department of State expressed deep concern over the arrest and demanded his immediate release.

It was written by Justin Brenneman and Julia Brownell and directed by Holly Dale. The episode premiered on NBC on May 11, 2013, the fifteenth episode of Season 2. Plot The episode opens with Hit List moving to Broadway and being in previews. Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee) sings \\"Pretender\\" in a Hit List number as Amanda's alter ego \\"Nina\\" performs for Sam Strickland's (Leslie Odom, Jr) manager character, who \\"Nina\\" is trying to get to be her manager. He introduces her to the Diva, played by Ana Vargas (Krysta Rodriguez), who fumbles her entrance and comes in late. Derek Wills (Jack Davenport) is concerned about Ana's mistakes. Derek talks about the show with Julia Houston (Debra Messing) (who's consulting) and Jimmy Collins (Jeremy Jordan). They all feel the show is missing something and aren't sure what. Jimmy, trying to keep the now deceased Kyle's spirit alive, doesn't want to change the writing. Derek publicly says that Ana, who's made several mistakes, needs a rest and decides to put in Daisy Parker (Mara Davi) (who is an old flame of Derek's and now in the ensemble) as the Diva for a night. Julia and Jimmy ponder that maybe the transfer to Broadway has lost a connection with the audience that existed in the off-Broadway show because of its smaller theaters. Ana is unhappy she's being replaced for the night and is suspicious of Derek's motives. Karen tells her she'll talk to Derek about it. When Ana tells her that Daisy was one of the women who accused Derek of sexual harassment the previous year, Karen confronts him about it. He divulges to her that after Daisy dropped the charges he went out with her a few times and during an intimate encounter, he promised her an understudy role in Hit List. The problem is that she filmed it and is blackmailing him with it and he says he doesn't have a choice. Karen is disgusted with him. Julia and Jimmy go to Jimmy and Kyle's apartment to check some of Kyle's notes for ideas. From an index card note, Julia remembers Kyle talking about wanting the audience to have a multimedia experience. They decide to put something in the show for that night's performance after the \\"I'm Not Sorry\\" number, basically tweeting the audience members and putting up a multimedia screen to engage them before the next number. Karen and Daisy perform \\"I'm Not Sorry\\" for Hit List, a performance that has \\"Nina\\" and the Diva performing at the Video Music Awards and trying to one-up each other. Eileen plans a Houston and Levitt tribute night for Tony voters to help get Bombshell some support for nominations. However, Julia is distracted with helping at Hit List and Tom is unhappy about it and word has got out that their partnership is splitting up. Tom, trying to get attention for his directing, turns the tribute into a cabaret revue that's more like an old time stripper show. He wants Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) to sing a song as a stripper. Ivy, having heard some gossip about several bad things she's done in her past, is afraid of anything that will put her in a bad light for Tony voters. However, she agrees to do it and performs \\"Grin and Bear It\\". Julia only makes it to the last part of the show but she and Tom sing \\"The Right Regrets\\". Afterwards, they hug and express regret about their fighting and Julia wonders if they really have to end their partnership. She's kind of scared since they've been partners for 11 years. He says maybe that's why the partnership needs to end. Jimmy wants more help with Hit List, but Julia tells him she was only consulting and helping with the transfer to Broadway and has to be loyal to and work on Bombshell. He is angry but tells her he understands. Karen and Ivy run into each other on the street and are friendly to each other. Ivy congratulates Karen on going to Broadway. Ivy then suggests that with the run up to the Tonys, they make every attempt not to stab each other in the back. Karen agrees. Ana, Derek and Karen are in a bar, and Derek tells the ladies that producer Jerry Rand loves Daisy as the Diva and wants her to remain in the role. Derek is unhappy about it but feels there's nothing he can do. He stalks off and passes Ivy without talking to her. Ana, who is angry about losing her job, asks Ivy about losing her Bombshell role early on after sleeping with Derek. Ivy is angry that Karen told Ana about that and confronts Karen about it. Karen says she's not trying to backstab Ivy, she told Ana because they are friends, and she thought everyone knew already. Ivy retorts that the only thing better than winning a Tony would be beating her for it and Karen decides to leave. Ivy then gets a call from her doctor's office telling her that she's pregnant Production The episode featured four songs, all originals. \\"Pretender\\" was written by Lucie Silvas and Michael Busbee.Broadwayworld.com, May 7, 2013, \\"McPhee's 'Pretender' From SMASH Now Available\\" \\"Grin and Bare It\\" and \\"The Right Regrets were written by the show's in-house songwriters Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman. \\"I'm Not Sorry\\" was written by Andrew McMahon.Broadwayworld.com, May 7, 2013, \\"McPhee/Davi SMASH 'I'm Not Sorry' Duet Now Available\\" \\"Pretender\\", \\"Grin and Bare It\\", and \\"I'm Not Sorry\\" were made available as singles the week the episode aired. \\"The Right Regrets\\" is available on the cast album Bombshell.

The game was played in Rayen Stadium in Youngstown, Ohio. The game marks the first use of the penalty flag in American football. Youngstown was highly favored against Oklahoma City in the press, based on their undefeated record up to that point. Youngstown defeated Oklahoma City by a score of 48 to 7. Game play First quarter Youngstown scored twice in the first quarter, both on connections between quarterback Jim Heber to end Pete Lanzi. The first, a 23-yard pass was the result of a fumble by Oklahoma City's fullback Bill Harris on their first possession within the first minute. The second was a 55-yard pass for a touchdown. Second quarter Neither team scored in the game's second quarter. Third quarter Youngstown scored two more touchdowns in the third quarter. First when Jim Heber threw an 18-yard pass once again to Pete Lanzi. Later in the period, substitutes Alfred Bucci caught a 21-yard pass from Glenn Dickson. The next score saw Oklahoma City complete a three-yard run for a touchdown. Fourth quarter Youngstown scored three more touchdowns in the fourth quarter as Glenn Dickson made it to the end zone again, this time on a 39-yard run. Youngstown defender Edward Lindsey made good with a 50-yard interception to score, and Youngstown's Cestary completed a four-yard carry. With extra points, Youngstown earned 21 points in the final quarter. Both teams managed to earn nine first downs from scrimmage. The final score was Youngstown 48, Oklahoma City 7. Aftermath Game official Jack McPhee said, \\"Through the use of the signal flag, everyone in the stadium knows that something is wrong. It's been a big help.\\" Officials generally agreed that the game play was better with the use of the penalty flag instead of the previous methods of blowing a whistle to mark a penalty. McPhee went on to use the penalty flag in other games including the Rose Bowl. It would be the only matchup between the two schools, as Oklahoma City later de-emphasized athletics and dropped to the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics in 1985; current NCAA rules only allow Division III schools to play NAIA-member schools, while Youngstown State is Division I FCS and is therefore only allowed to play Division I FBS and a limited number of Division II schools in addition to other D-I FCS schools. Oklahoma City University (now known as the \\"Stars\\") have also have not fielded a football program since the Second World War. The two areas do have a current connection between them: former Oklahoma Sooners head coach Bob Stoops is a Youngstown native. The American Football Coaches Association officially introduced the penalty flag at the 1948 rules session. The penalty flag is now standard officiating equipment and is used in every competitive football game throughout the world. In 1969, the original penalty flag was turned over to the College Football Hall of Fame.

Finished around 1770, it currently serves as a museum showcasing historical artifacts. Among the many historical artifacts, the museum displays torture equipment used on victims during the inquisition. These items were been removed from display in 2015 prior to visits to Colombia by Pope Francis. They have since partially returned and are again on display. The museum has been described as \\"one of the finer buildings\\" in Cartagena. Cited as one of Cartagena's \\"best examples of late colonial, civil architecture\\", it faces the Parque de Bol√≠var. History The establishment of the Palace was decreed by Philip III. Since Cartagena was a center of commerce, a transit point between the Caribbean and Spanish settlements in western South America, the city became the third in the Spanish empire to have a tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition. Some merchants were Portuguese and suspected of being crypto-Jews (Jews passing as Christian). During the period 1580-1640, the crown of Portugal and that of Spain were ruled by the same monarch, and the period saw many Portuguese merchants active in Spain's overseas colonies. Established in 1610, the current building was completed much later. The Palace was used by Inquisition to try Jews and other non-Catholics and about 800 individuals believed guilty of crimes such as black magic were publicly executed there. Architecture Entrance to the Palace Palace of Inquisition interior The Palace is built in Spanish Colonial style, with elements from the Baroque era. A crucifix occupies one of the walls facing a torture equipment. The white brick structure has gateways made of stone. The rooms of the Palace are mostly made up of masonry. The framework of the Palace is built out of wood; double-storey limestones were also used in the making of the Palace. The museum displays coins, maps, weapons, furniture, church bells, and depictions of notable generals, in addition to the torture equipment used previously. The Palace was partially restored to preserve Colombia's cultural heritage.

Double Dealing Character was also released on Steam on June 18, 2019.https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043240/__Double_Dealing_Character/ Gameplay Double Dealing Character followed the previous main games within the Touhou Project series, with a spell card based danmaku system. The gameplay theme is neither novel nor retro. It is a \\"2000's neo-retro Danmaku shooter\\", creating simple gameplay while removing a lot of the complicated game mechanics. This is the first main game within the series that can display a resolution of 1280√ó960. Players can choose between three protagonists: Reimu Hakurei, Marisa Kirisame and Sakuya Izayoi. Each character can choose from two shot types: one for which they take up their possessed weapon and another for leaving it behind. The scoring system is focused around item collection. Collecting many items in one big scoop will award the player with bonus points based on how many items were collected. This is done by moving above a border near the top of the screen or by using a bomb. The point value can also be increased by grazing, shooting focused and cancelling out bullets (of which plays an important role in scoring again compared to Subterranean Animism through Ten Desires). Spell Card values have also been increased in comparison to previous games. Bomb and life fragments are also present in this release. They can drop from bosses, as well as being awarded for item collection. Plot Youkai are rioting and tsukumogami are turning up. Clouds gather, while a strong wind carries the sounds of a huge building. Gensokyo is full of sounds of dissonance. The weapons of the three protagonists start acting oddly; meanwhile, various youkai begin to rebel. It's their job to either take their weapons in hand and fight the youkai, or to cast their weapons aside.

It is located in the original 1885 building of the Weisbrod & Hess Oriental Brewing Company, which operated on the site until 1939. The Bartons are former co-owners of Yards Brewing Company. As partners in that company, and on its behalf, they acquired and renovated the brewery facility in 2001. After a dispute with Yards co-founder Tom Kehoe over the future direction of the company, the pair resigned from Yards in 2007. In early 2007, the Bartons struck an agreement with Kehoe to surrender their interest in Yards in exchange for control of its facility. The Bartons were able to retain their entire staff of Yards employees along with the brewing equipment. (Kehoe had Yards products contract brewed at the Lion Brewery in Wilkes-Barre, PA and would later move to a new facility near the Delaware River.) The Bartons and McBride formally launched Philadelphia Brewing Company beers on March 5, 2008. Two of the company's most popular beers, Kenzinger and Walt Wit, are available on tap at Citizens Bank Park, the South Philadelphia baseball park where the Philadelphia Phillies play.  Operations  The company brews five year-round beers, several seasonal beers and the occasional one-off recipe. It sources ingredients locally, does not use preservatives and operates as its own distributor. Approximately 85 percent of PBC's sales are in the Philadelphia region with an additional 10 percent in the Pittsburgh area. The company's Pittsburgh offices are the former home of Duquesne Brewing Company.

The film-poem examines the political and social issues connected to the fall of the working class in England, amidst the more general phenomenon of the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe, using the myth of Prometheus as a metaphor for the struggles of the working class and the devastation brought on by political conflict and unfettered industrialisation. It was broadcast on Channel 4 and was also shown at the Locarno Film Festival. It was used by Harrison to highlight the plight of the workers both in Europe and in Britain. His film- poem begins at a post-industrialist wasteland in Yorkshire brought upon by the politics of confrontation between the miners and the government of Margaret Thatcher. It has been described as \\"the most important artistic reaction to the fall of the British working class\\" at the end of the twentieth century. Influence Harrison has acknowledged that he was influenced by Percy Shelley work Prometheus Unbound. Harrison actually started the planning of his film at the Baths of Caracalla in Rome so that he could be in the same city as Shelley when he was writing his drama. Plot Walter Sparrow plays the role of an elderly, emphysema-laden Yorkshire miner who is about to retire. In a bleak, post-industrialist landscape, the old miner meets a boy who is reciting a poem about Prometheus. The youth is played by Jonathan Waintridge. The miner eventually ends up in a depleted local cinema and, though sick with emphysema, he defiantly lights-up a cigarette. With the old miner at the theatre, the run-down projection equipment suddenly comes to life and projections appear on the old screen. The person directing these projections is Hermes, the messenger of Zeus. Both Hermes and Zeus represent capitalism in the film. Hermes is played by Michael Feast. Hermes, with a British upper-class accent which contrasts with the coalminer's warm, smoky, northern working-class accent, starts lecturing the coalminer about the failings of humankind. Hermes is presented as cruel and obnoxious, in one instance acting as the tallyman in a mine which has been designated to close, lowering the miners in the pit while attacking them in verse: As they give Hermes their tally, the miners quietly mumble expletives at him. In the pit scene Hermes also quotes verses 944-946 in ancient Greek from Prometheus Bound. Eventually, the old man starts seeing a huge golden statue of Prometheus, nicknamed Goldenballs in the film. It is revealed that the statue was made by melting the bodies of Yorkshire miners. The film traces the trip the statue takes in the back of a truck through Eastern Europe, revisiting the horrors of World War II European History in places such as Auschwitz, Dresden and the Polish industrial city of Nowa Huta. As they pass from these places, Hermes tries to have the locals denounce Prometheus for their condition and all the ills he has brought them with his gift, rather than Zeus. Sometimes he succeeds, but not in Nowa Huta where the locals refuse to denounce Prometheus much to the chagrin of Hermes, who then lashes out at them through rhyming verses. In the end, the old coal miner, who represents the spirit of Prometheus in the film, arrives in Greece where he speaks about the powerful impact of fire on humankind. Analysis and reception In Reception Studies it is mentioned that Harrison in his film has metaphorically \\"linked the gnawed liver of Prometheus to the eagle of genocide and the blackened lungs of the coalminers\\" and it was the bodies of the Yorkshire coalminers which were consumed by fire, as in √âmile Zola's Germinal, that were used in the casting of the statue of Harrison's Prometheus. Edith Hall has written that she is convinced that Harrison's Prometheus is \\"the most important artistic reaction to the fall of the British working class\\" at the end of the twentieth century, and considers it as \\"the most important adaptation of classical myth for a radical political purpose for years\\" and Harrison's \\"most brilliant artwork, with the possible exception of his stage play The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus\\". Hall continues that Harrison's vision of a statue made by melting miners' bodies is a \\"horrific metamorphosis\\" where \\"miners‚Äô bodies are transformed visually into bullion\\" and that such transformation \\"from concrete to abstract labor, and thence to symbolic capital\\" highlights Harrison's use of imagery which involves capitalist and Marxist economic theories of the twentieth century. Edith Hall also compares the similarities between Harrison's work and Theo Angelopoulos' Ulysses' Gaze in that both works feature nonlinear-chronological movement through Eastern European places characterised by \\"monumental statuary\\" and classifies Harrison's Prometheus as a threnody although certain elements relating to the imagery of the film and its adaptation of classical themes also bring it closer to the film techniques of Michelakis. According to Lorna Hardwick, the film-poem attempts a new type of redemptive effect by using art as a \\"mirror to horrors\\" saving the audience from turning to stone, quoting Rowland's comments about Harrison's film-poem The Gaze of the Gorgon. Helen Morales remarks that the Yorkshire coal miner \\"embodies the spirit of Prometheus\\" and that his dialogues with Hermes, \\"Zeus' cruel henchman\\", are \\"brilliant articulations of oppression and defiance\\". Carol Dougherty mentions that in Harrison's 1995 play The Labourers of Herakles there is a scene where Hercules, while lying on his own funeral pyre, delivers a speech about the power of fire in a manner reminiscent of Harrison's treatment of the same theme during his 1998 film Prometheus.

The vendors are garbed in a traditional, brightly colored rooster costume playing suasion horn and yelling, in residential areas. In some places, Chicken and Lam is called Flying Lam, because the vendors throw the olive to customers who are living on a higher floor. They pack the olive in a small paper bag, and if someone throws money at them, they throw back an olive.  Chicken and lam  Olives are a traditional Chinese ingredient, one used in dishes such as Chicken and Lam (Lam is the Chinese word for a white olive.) Fresh olives undergo a complicated process; mixed with Chinese herbs and seasoning. Different pickling procedures make for varied flavors. The sweet version is Shun Lam, the salty one is Licorice Lam, the spicy one is Chili Lam. The pickled olive is placed inside chicken dressing.  History  Chicken and Lam became popular during the 1930s and 1940s, due to the increasing pace of life. More recently the practice mostly ended. The Shangxiajiu Road, the busiest business district, is probably the only place where Chicken and Lam is still offered. This is because the Guangzhou Government classified the dish and practice as part of the city's cultural heritage. Subsidies are offered to encourage now-licensed, government employee vendors to continue. A vendor can sell around 50 servings of Chicken and Lam per day. However, the job is demanding. One vendor stated, 'The chicken dressing weigh's 5 kg and we have to wear it for 12 hours every day'. The long work hours is believed to be another reason that stops young people from becoming vendors.

Background Holyfield was coming off a successful defense of his Undisputed Heavyweight Championship after defeating 42-year-old former Heavyweight champion George Foreman. Meanwhile, Mike Tyson had twice defeated Donvan \\"Razor\\" Ruddock to become the number one contender to Holyfield's titles. However, the two sides had trouble working out a deal and both men's camps began to look into having their respective fighter instead face Foreman. In July 1991, it was reported that a Holyfield‚ÄìForeman rematch was agreed upon, but only a day later it was announced that Holyfield and Tyson's promoters, Dan Duva and Don King had agreed to a blockbuster deal that would see Holyfield and Tyson meet on November 8, 1991 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.Tyson to Fight Champ Holyfield, Won't Face Foreman, Philadelphia Inquirer article, 1991-07-11, Retrieved on 2013-05-12 In addition, Holyfield and Tyson were expected to split a then-record $45 million purse with the champion Holyfield reportedly to earn $30 million, while the challenger Tyson would net $15 million.Let's Get Ready To Rumble!, Sports Illustrated article, 1991-07-22, Retrieved on 2013-05-12 Unfortunately, a rib injury that Tyson had suffered, as well as his arrest and conviction for the alleged rape of Desiree Washington shortly after led to the fight being postponed and eventually cancelled.

Times article, 1991-11-18, Retrieved on 2013-05-12 As Cooper was unranked by the WBC, the organization refused to sanction the match, thus Holyfield's WBC title was not on the line. The fight Though Cooper was given little chance to defeat Holyfield, he nevertheless put on a decent showing against the champion. In the first round, Holyfield used his speed to take advantage of Cooper, consistently hitting him with several quick combinations. A little past midway through the round, Holyfield hit Cooper with a left hook to the body that dropped him to the canvas, though Cooper quickly got up and survived the rest of the round. After a solid second round from both fighters, Holyfield came out strong in the opening seconds of round 3, staggering Cooper with a left hook to the side of the head. As the first minute of the round was coming to a close, Cooper landed a right hand to Holyfield's head that staggered the champ. Cooper then got Holyfield against the ropes and landed a combination that included a right hand to the back of Holyfield's head. Before Holyfield could fall to the canvas, he grabbed the top rope to keep himself up. Despite not hitting the floor, referee Mills Lane called it a knockdown, the first of Holyfield's professional career. Cooper continued his attack on Holyfield, landing several powerful punches and nearly knocking him down again, but Holyfield held on to Cooper just as he was about to go down. As the second minute passed, Holyfield regained his form and proceeded to land a powerful combination of his own. The two men traded punches for nearly the entire final minute of the round, but both men survived without any further knockdowns. After three more rounds, Holyfield ended the fight late in round 7. With 20 second to go in the round, Holyfield hit Cooper with a long combination. Though Cooper never went down, he could no longer defend himself, causing Lane to stop the fight with two seconds left in the round and award Holyfield the victory via technical knockout.Heavy Going, Sports Illustrated article, 1991-12-02, Retrieved May 12, 2013 References Category:1991 in boxing Category:Boxing in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Sports competitions in Atlanta Category:1991 in sports in Georgia (U.S. state) Cooper Category:World Boxing Council heavyweight championship matches Category:World Boxing Association heavyweight championship matches Category:International Boxing Federation heavyweight championship matches Category:November 1991 sports events in the United States ","title":"Evander Holyfield vs. Bert Cooper"},{"id":"39365598","title":"2003 Asian Badminton Championships"},{"id":"39365599","text":"Zabrus gravis is a species of ground beetle in the Iberozabrus subgenus that can be found in Portugal and Spain.

She was born in 20 November 1872 into the Yeoheung Min clan to Min Taeho, leader of the Yeoheung Min clan, and Lady Jin-yang of the Jincheon Song clan. Her older brother, Min Yeong-ik, was the adoptive nephew of Empress Myeongseong through her adoptive older brother, Min Seung-ho (who is the uncle of Min Yeong-ik). She became Crown Princess Consort when she married Sunjong in 1882 at the age of 11, and died on 5 November 1904. The princess, aged 22, was a witness to her mother-in-law's assassination in 8 October 1895, when she stood in front of the Empress, attempting to protect her. This may have contributed to her early death, as she was plagued by severe depression thereafter. She was given the posthumous title Empress Sunmyeonghyo of Korea (Hangul: ÏàúÎ™ÖÌö®Ìô©ÌõÑ, Hanja: Á¥îÊòéÂ≠ùÁöáÂêé) when Sunjong became emperor on 19 July 1907.

She was then moved to Geumgok-dong, Namyangju where the Neungho was changed to Yureung when Sunjong died in 1926. The empress is buried with her husband and his second wife, Empress Sunjeong.  Trivia  Empress Sunmyeong‚Äôs uncle, Min Seung-ho, is the adoptive older brother to her mother-in-law; which makes her the adoptive niece to Empress Myeongseong, and the biological niece to Grand Internal Princess Consort Sunmok, Emperor Gojong‚Äôs mother.

Known as Shikyo-en when completed in 1961, it emphasizes water, stones, and evergreen plants. The naturalistic hillside site features streams, a waterfall, a tea house, and blooming magnolia and camellia trees. According to the Los Angeles Conservancy, the garden is among the largest and most significant private residential Japanese-style gardens built in the United States in the immediate Post-World War II period. The garden was donated to the University of California, Los Angeles in 1965 and open to the public until 2011. Following a legal dispute with Hannah Carter's children, it was sold to a private citizen in 2016.

Guiberson as a Hawaiian garden on the Harry Calandar estate by landscape architect A.E. Hanson (1893‚Äì1986). It was dedicated to his mother, Ethel L. Guiberson, who founded the Beverly Hills Garden Club in the early 1930s. The Japanese garden was designed by Nagao Sakurai in 1959 and constructed between 1959 and 1961.Editorial, \\"UCLA's garden spot\\", Los Angeles Times, January 22, 2012Garden ConservancyUSC: Secret Gardens: Welcome to the world Japanese GardensAlbert George Pickerell, The University of California: A Pictorial History, Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1968 , p. 275 In 1965, it was purchased by Edward W.

Birnbaum, \\"UCLA Violates a Long-Standing Regent's Bequest and Endangers One of the Rarest Private Japanese Gardens in the United States\\", The Huffington Post, May 02, 2012 Carter named it after his second wife, Hannah Carter. The same year, Carter, who served as Chair of the University of California Board of Regents, donated it to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The donation included their house uphill from the garden. The garden was rehabilitated in 1969 by UCLA Professor Koichi Kawana after heavy rainfall caused damage to the site. Edward Carter died in 1996. Hannah Carter lived in the house till 2006. After she died in 2009, the regents of the university asked a court to release them from the commitment to maintain the garden forever and allow the sale of the house and garden at auction. In 2011, UCLA closed the garden to the public because of rising costs, deferred maintenance, and lack of attendance as a result of limited parking. On March 3, 2012, the garden was listed for sale by Coldwell Banker.'UCLA Plans to Sell Its Historic Japanese Garden', KCRW, January 30, 2012 However, the prospective sale was opposed by the American Public Gardens Association, the American Society of Landscape Architects, the Bel Air Garden Club, the California Garden and Landscape History Society, the California Preservation Foundation, the Cultural Landscape Foundation, The Garden Conservancy, the Los Angeles Conservancy, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the North American Japanese Garden Association, etc. On July 27, 2012 the Los Angeles County Superior Court halted the listing by issuing a preliminary injunction. Judge Lisa Hart Cole described the action of UCLA and the Regents as \\"duplicitous.\\" The Regents appealed the preliminary injunction. On September 16, 2013, the three judge Court of Appeal unanimously upheld the preliminary injunction. A trial date was scheduled beginning July 20, 2015 at the Santa Monica Courthouse of Los Angeles Superior Court. In October 2015, the heirs agreed to let UCLA sell the garden as long as the new owners kept the garden intact for the next 30 years. Meanwhile, the University of California Board of Regents established a US$500,000 endowment whose annual income to go to the preservation of the garden. In June 2016, UCLA sold the garden to developer Mark Gabay, the co-founder of the Charles Company, for US$12.5 million. The new owner is not required to open the garden to the public. Overview It features winding paths, a waterfall, and a stone pagoda.UCLA's garden spot, The Los Angeles Times, January 22, 2012 Moreover, the main gate, garden houses, bridges and family shrines were built in Japan and reassembled in California.

(page. 77) Minan-ur-Rahman, (Arabic), by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1895) A short Treatise, namely Minan-ur- Rahman (1895) English translation by Qazi Abdul Hameed, Lahore (1963) Minan- ur-Rahman (English Translation) 1963 by Qazi Abdul Hameed Apparently the book appears to be in response to Max Muller's belief that: ::: ‚ÄúI, therefore, date the real beginning of the science of language from the first day of Pentecost.‚Äù Lectures on the Science of Language, page 53. page 53 Ahmad strongly reacted to this claim and refuted Max Muller's proposition by referring him to the NT Acts II:4-6, explaining that the Disciples only spoke languages already known and understood by all the Jews \\"And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance ... Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.\\" -Acts 2:4,6\\" Ahmad writes, he very earnestly prayed to God, and asked for true knowledge in this regard. So God diverted his attention to a verse of the Quran 30:23. :: ŸàŸéŸÖŸêŸÜŸí ÿ°ŸéÿßŸäŸéŸÄÿ™ŸêŸáŸê ÿÆŸéŸÑŸíŸÇŸè ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸéŸëŸÖŸéŸÄŸàŸéÿ™Ÿê ŸàŸéÿßŸÑÿßŸåŸëÿ±Ÿíÿ∂Ÿê ŸàŸéÿßÿÆŸíÿ™ŸêŸÑŸéŸÄŸÅŸè ÿ£ŸéŸÑŸíÿ≥ŸêŸÜŸéÿ™ŸêŸÉŸèŸÖŸí ŸàŸéÿ£ŸéŸÑŸíŸàŸéŸÜŸêŸÉŸèŸÖŸí ::ÿ•ŸêŸÜŸéŸë ŸÅŸêŸâ ÿ∞ŸÑŸêŸÉŸé ŸÑÿ£ŸéŸäŸéŸÄÿ™Ÿç ŸÑŸêŸëŸÑŸíÿπŸéŸÄŸÑŸéŸÖŸêŸäŸÜŸé [The Quran, 30:23] And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the diversity of your tongues and colours. In that surely are Signs for those who possess knowledge. Ahmad claimed in light of Quranic verses: ::\\"All praise is due to Allah, the Sustainer, the Beneficent. To Him belongs all Excellence, Grace and Goodness. He created man and taught him a plain language. And out of one language He created various languages in different countries just as He created various colors (of mankind); out of one color. And He made Arabic the mother of all languages. He made it the like of the sun in brightness and luster.\\"Minan-ur- Rahman - Arabic - the mother of all languages He claimed, the true Science of Languages has been taught in the Quran, explaining the unique characteristics of the Arabic language. \\"He created man then taught him speech and guided him \\" (page 85). Unique Characteristics of Arabic In this book Minan-ur-Rahman Ahmad claimed that Arabic was the very First Language, taught to man by God. Ahmad describes the system of Mufradaat [the Simples or the Roots of words] in the Arabic Language had a unique scientific organization and a system, unknown in any other language. He described the five peculiarities of Arabic and claimed, all other languages of man, were derived from Arabic, He explained, in the Arabic language, even the lonely alphabets (a, b, c etc.) at times manifest full and extensive meanings. e.g.:( see pp. 10‚Äì11) ŸÅŸê (fi) 'Be faithful' ŸÇŸê (qi) 'Keep an eye on' ŸÑŸê (li) 'Come nearer' ÿπŸê ('I) 'Call to mind' ÿßŸê (I) 'Promise' ÿÆŸê (Khe) 'Go, neither slowly nor fast, but with rather moderate pace' €ÅŸê (hi) 'Burst thyself, or become weak' ÿØŸê (di) 'Pay blood- money' ÿ±Ÿê (ri) 'Flare up, become brighter, or come out of the fireplace.' or 'Become dirty' ÿ¥Ÿê (shi) 'Paint thy garments with patterns ' ŸÜŸê (ni) 'Be slow or lazy' Ahmad goes on explaining, sometimes even small single words give extensive meanings: e.g. ÿπÿ±ÿ∂ÿ™Ÿè (araztu) means: \\"I have roamed about Makkah, Madina, and all the habitations around them.\\" ÿ∑€ÅŸÅŸÑÿ™Ÿè (Tahfaltu) means: \\"I eat and have determined always to eat Millet bread .\\" ÿ¨ÿ´ŸÖŸé (Jasama) means: \\"Half the night has passed\\". ÿ≠€åÿπŸÑŸé (Haya-al) means: \\"Come; Pray! It is proper time.\\" The Mother Language \\"The Arabic language possesses excellent qualities and signs which, in the eyes of scholars, invest it with the status of a Mother in relation to other languages, and these languages are like a shadow in relation to Arabic or like sparrows in relation to a preying falcon.\\" (page 100). Ahmad believed that Arabic, being the First Language, however, in due course of time, great changes in the structure and form of the vocal apparatus, man's ecology and environment, and many other unknown factors, caused a diversification of Arabic language into thousands of tongues, all derived from Arabic. He writes, quoting from the Hebrew Torah, Genesis 11:1:- ::: ◊ï◊ô◊î◊ô ◊õ◊ú ◊î◊ê◊®◊• ◊©◊Ç◊§◊î ◊ê◊ó◊™ ◊ï◊ì◊ë◊®◊ô◊ù ◊ê◊ó◊ì◊ô◊ù◊É :::\\"And the whole earth was one lip and speeches identical\\". (Gen, 11:1) [page. 14] ::...the nearness or remoteness of a place from the equator, of the distinctive effect of the various plants, and because of other unknown factors, every locality inheres in its inhabitants a proclivity of a special kind, towards developing a peculiar voice-apparatus, a distinctive accent, and a form of words which is of a peculiar character....[page: 12] He after commenting upon the relationship of Hebrew, or Sanskrit to Arabic, writes: ::...all the languages of the world have come into existence through a process of far reaching change, yet by fully pondering over it, and by looking at the operative factors, it clearly appears that the speeches and words of these languages have been transplanted into a variety of shapes and forms from Arabic simples. [page. 16] ::\\"Arabic is singular in its attributes, perfect in its root-words, wonderful in the charm of its compounds and captivating in the structural beauty of its sentences.\\" (page 105). Five Points of Excellence Ahmad highlighted Five points of the excellence of the Arabic language: [page. 17] 1\\\\. Arabic has a complete organised structure of roots, that is to say, the roots meet fully all the needs of human beings in the field of expression ; the other languages are not so fitted. 2\\\\. In Arabic, the names of the Divine Being, the names of the principal constituent parts of the universe, of plants, animals and minerals and of the members of the human body, possess, in the why and wherefore of their contents, deep philosophy and learning. 3\\\\. The Additions and the roots of Arabic words are perfectly organised. The scope of this organisation, by linking into one philosophical chain, all the verbs and nouns, belonging to the same root, points out their interrelationships. This is not to be found, to this degree of excellence, in other languages. 4\\\\. In Arabic expressions, words are few but meanings are many, that is to say, the Arabic language makes use of (ÿß) [alif], and (ŸÑ) [laam] and nunnation (ÿ™ŸÜŸà€åŸÜ) and the sequence of words, in such a way that to express the same meaning the other languages need a number of sentences to be linked up for the same purpose. 5\\\\. Arabic possesses roots and expressions which are the perfect means of portraying the most delicate and deep things of the mind and human ideas. A greater part of the book is devoted to manifest these characteristic in further details. He writes, \\" Thousands of languages are stricken with the calamity of a drawback that instead of root-words they make use of complex grammatical constructions, which shows that at a time of need such constructions have been invented by man.\\" [page. 22] Arabic follows the Law of Nature After the above Introductory details, the rest of the treatise is in a very lucid and elegant Arabic.[page 27-127] He explains that Arabic is unique to follow the patterns we observe in Nature. Two distinct features, i.e.'the pre-existing' Grace of God, like the bounties of Nature, the qualities inherent in the soil and earth, the sun and the changing weathers etc. And the second aspect being human efforts, labour and endeavours, these combine to give birth to the fruit of human endeavours. To fulfil these Two requirements, Arabic has Two distinct words for Mercy, Rahman [ÿ±ÿ≠ŸÖÿßŸÜ]and Raheem. [ÿ±ÿ≠€åŸÖ]. To explain his point, Ahmad writes: ::It will be noticed that in as much this quality Mercy, in accordance with the eternal distribution process. consisted of two manifestations of the Divine Law of Nature. there are to be found two root-words in the Arabic language to express that fact. And for a seeker of Truth. it would be profitable to follow the rule that the Attributes and Acts of God which are prominently portrayed in the Book of Nature should be taken as a standard, that their different categories which are apparent from the Law of Nature should be searched for in the root-words of Arabic, and that when ever it is intended to point out the difference between Arabic synonyms, which relate to the attributes or the acts of God, one should turn to the division and distribution of the attributes or acts of God which are apparent from the working of the universe, for, the real object of the Arabic language is the service of Divine Knowledge, as the real aim of the creation of man is the recognition of the Creator. [page. 35] Ten Categories of Arabic Roots Ahmad believed that Arabic was the Language of Divine Realization and designed to fulfill the Physical and Spiritual needs of man. He classified the Arabic Root-Words, into ten categories, calling them as the Ten Circles of Roots. He describes them as follows: (pp: 38-40) ::1) Root-words relating to the Person of God, arguments for the existence of God, His attributes, His Names and Acts, His Practice and Custom. ::2) The system of root-words relating to the Unity of God and the arguments on behalf thereof. ::3) The system of root- words which deals with the attributes, acts, and actions, habits and situations, spiritual and physical, (of man) which, along with their mutual distinctions, are perpetrated by man and which may appear, in agreement with or in opposition to God's Will. ::4) The system of root-words which constitute, as facts of Divine knowledge; a perfected teaching from God Almighty and which relate to inculcations or techniques dealing with morals, beliefs, rights of God, rights of men, philosophic learning, punishments, commandments, the Do's and Dont's. ::5) The system of root-words which expound the nature of true salvation, the true means or methods of obtaining it; the signs by which the saved believers and those who occupy a station of nearness to God may be recognized. ::6) The system of root-words which explain what is Islam, what is disbelief, what is shirk or polytheistic belief and which deal forth with the arguments for the truth of Islam, and refute the objections against Islam. ::7) The system of root-words which refute all the wrong beliefs of opponents. ::8) The system of root-words which relate to warnings and tidings, promise of favourable or adverse happenings ; which relate to description of the hereafter, to miracles and to parables or which are of the nature of prophecies which contribute to the strengthening of one's faith, or which relate to other expedient subjects, or which deal with narratives which are meant as a warning, a threat, or a tiding. ::9) The system of root-words which relate to the life-story and chaste qualities of the Holy Prophet (May peace and blessings of God be upon him,) which consist of the high example of the pure life of the Holy Prophet ; which also partake of full and forceful arguments in support of the prophet-hood of the Holy Prophet (may peace and the blessings of God be upon him.) ::10) The system of root-words which expound the beauties and the spiritual effectiveness of the Holy Quran and which set out its inherent qualities. Language as the Evolution of Names How did language come into being? To quote Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: \\" On the ultimate origin of language speculation has been rife, more, however, among philosophers than among philologists, who have very often been too matter-of- fact to take an interest in this problem. Some scholars (among them quite recently W. Schmidt) see the insufficiency of the usual theories, and giving up all attempts at explaining it in a natural way fall back on the religious belief that the first language was directly given to the first men by God through a miracle.\\" Origin of Language Encyclop√¶dia BritannicaArchaeology and Bible history, (1992) by Joseph P. Free, page 43 (W. Schmidt on Language, ::\\"When man was made to evolve through stages of creation ; when he was transferred from a state of potentiality to one of actuality, when he was given, in his nature and physical evolution, different shapes and figures, and some of the varieties of creation succeeded other varieties, and there happened to be mutual differences and distinctions, the process gave rise to many degrees and stages which required to be described by Names, Arabic provided them with their \\"names\\", and thus completed its gift as is the custom of rich philanthropists.\\" (page 123) Further Contributions  A renowned Philologist Sheikh Muhammad Ahmad Mazhar (1896-1993) has contributed immensely to the work of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and studied the various languages (around 35) and traced them to their Arabic Root-Words.

It courses along the northwestern border of Almaden Quicksilver County Park in the Ca√±ada de los Capitancillos before joining Los Alamitos Creek after the latter exits Lake Almaden. This confluence forms the Guadalupe River mainstem, which in turn flows through San Jose and empties into south San Francisco Bay at Alviso Slough. History The \\"Valley of the Little Captains\\" or Rancho Ca√±ada de los Capitancillos is named for the ca√±ada, or valley, through which Guadalupe Creek courses. The river was once used for recreation prior to the removal of the Guadalupe Dam. Watershed and course The Guadalupe Creek subwatershed drains . Heading downstream east from the peak of Mount Umunhum, Guadalupe Creek is joined on the left by Rincon Creek, then on the right by Los Capitancillos Creek before reaching Guadalupe Reservoir. Guadalupe Dam, built in 1935, formed the reservoir. The main purpose of the reservoir is to capture runoff from winter storms to recharge in the Alamitos percolation pond system during the summer. Below Guadalupe Dam, Guadalupe Creek follows Hicks Road, and just below the intersection of Reynolds Road is joined on the left first by perennial Cherry Springs (aka Reynolds) Creek, which originates at Cherry Springs. Cherry Springs Creek has a small perennial tributary, Hicks Creek, which originates on the northern side of El Sombroso Peak and flows into Reynolds Creek from the west. The next Guadalupe River tributary is Pheasant Creek, which runs below Hicks Road between Pheasant and Wagner Roads to join Guadalupe Creek from the left. At the intersection of Shannon Road and Hicks Road, Guadalupe Creek is joined from the left next by Shannon Creek. Masson Dam, built in 1964, is a small diversion dam about upstream of Almaden Expressway. The dam conveys water into the Los Capitancillos percolation ponds continually, unless Guadalupe Reservoir spills, in which case diversion operations terminate until the rainy season ends. In 1999, Masson Dam, which had been a complete barrier to fish passage, was removed and then re-built, along with a fish ladder which was completed in 2000. Completed in 1962 and reconstructed in 1964, the Los Capitancillos percolation ponds occupy about 63 acres, from Almaden Expressway (east) to Camden Avenue (west). Guadalupe Creek crosses Almaden Expressway just before joining Los Alamitos Creek at Lake Almaden, the beginning of the Guadalupe River. Lake Almaden was historically a meadow but was formed by a gravel removing quarry operation. Guadalupe Creek has been entirely earthen since a short 500 foot section of concrete channel was removed near its confluence with Pheasant Creek. Ecology Steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) spawned historically in Guadalupe Creek and its Pheasant Creek and Hicks (Cherry Springs) Creek tributaries through the 1950s but construction of Masson Dam formed an impassable barrier. It is not clear whether steelhead use the fish ladder constructed in 2000. Resident rainbow trout persist in the upper Guadalupe Creek above the dam. The creek below Guadalupe Dam supports the western pond turtle (Actinemys marmorata), foothill yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii), yellow warbler, double crested cormorant, and rainbow trout. Rare flora include Mount Hamilton thistle (Cirsium fontinale var. campylon ), Santa Clara Valley dudleya (Dudleya setchellii)(Endangered), Santa Clara red ribbons (Clarkia concinna automixa), fragrant fritillary (Fritillaria liliacea) and the Mount Hamilton jewelflower (Streptanthus callistus). Mercury contamination Guadalupe Creek is impaired (303(d) listed) by mercury contamination. Historically, workers disposed of roasted mercury mining wastes, called calcines, and other waste in or near Guadalupe Creek and Los Alamitos Creek so that waste materials would be transported downstream by winter flows. Guadalupe Reservoir covers a former mercury ore processing area. Calcines and other mining wastes are still present along the banks of Guadalupe Creek above Camden Avenue, along the banks of upper Guadalupe Creek near the former Guadalupe Mine outside of the Almaden Quicksilver County Park. A partly vegetated mining waste pile is present at Hicks Flat on the opposite side of Guadalupe Creek from the main mine. A half-mile stretch of Guadalupe Creek between Almaden Expressway and Masson Dam was restored in 2001 as mitigation for the downtown San Jose flood control project. Restoration included removal of mercury-contaminated sediments and recreation of a meandering stream course with native vegetation. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for Guadelupe Creek, stating that no one should eat any fish caught here.

The unnamed female narrator recounts her obsession with the mystical coincidence of two friends who seem destined to meet and who apparently do unite in spirit after death. Calling the story's original title \\"colourless\\", James renamed it \\"The Friends of the Friends\\" in 1909, revising it for inclusion in the New York Edition. Plot \\"The Way It Came\\" begins with a frame story prologue, a 'cover note' by a magazine editor who judges a diarist's 'fragment' to be as fantastic as it is stylistically suspect. Because the diary is undated, its author leaving no names or initials to identity herself or her two friends, the editor advises that there is little public benefit to publishing such a sensationalisic account unless some corroborative clue to the characters' real-life identities can be found. The (unnamed) narrator mentions to her (unnamed) male friend that his experience of \\"seeing\\" his mother at the moment of her death, though he was in fact far away and ignorant of her illness, parallels that of an (unnamed) female friend of hers who experienced something similar at the moment her father died. Both the man and woman express interest in meeting and comparing their accounts, but are apparently prevented from being introduced by a variety of accidents and thwarting circumstances. Their similar psychic visions, however, told among an increasingly wider circle of shared friends, gain added luster from the fact that the man and woman also share certain tastes, character traits, and superstitions, including a peculiar unwillingness ever to be photographed (thus they can have no idea what the other looks like, and would not recognize each other on a London street, for example). After several years of friendship the narrator accepts her male friend's proposal of marriage; she also insists he allow himself to be photographed for the first time. Inviting her female friend for a long-scheduled tea to meet her fianc√©, she has last minute reservations about introducing them before her wedding. Laying blame squarely on her fianc√© for his unexpected absence--she had written a note to him implying the woman's afternoon visit was cancelled--she shows her female friend the photo of her husband with his address on the back, which she apparently turns over and reads. Her fianc√©'s disapproval of her ruse prompts her to apologize to her female friend in person. But she arrives at her friend's home the following morning only to find she has unexpectedly died overnight. Describing her previous day's appearance and costume in detail, however, the narrator's fianc√© hears the news of her death insisting that the woman in fact appeared to him without speaking for about 20 minutes in his home on the night of her death, echoing the spirit of his mother which appeared at the hour of her death. But investigation into whether the narrator's female friend had time to physically visit (and enter) the man's house before returning home, having learned his address from the photograph, proves inconclusive. The narrator grows increasingly jealous of the memory her fianc√© has of meeting her late female friend, and in time breaks off the engagement convinced he is bonded to her ghostly presence and possibly even in regular communication with her. Six years later the man dies, still unmarried, with the narrator bitterly insinuating that he took his own life. Publication history \\"The Way It Came\\" first appeared in Chapman's Magazine of Fiction (London) in May 1896.

Coffee production in Venezuela began in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in the Premontane shankarof the Andes mountains. Jos√© Gumilla, a Jesuit priest, is credited with introducing coffee into Venezuela, in 1732. Its production is attributed to the large demand for the product, coupled with cheap labour and low land costs. It was first exported to Brazil. Coffee production in Venezuela led to the \\"complex migration\\" of people to this region in the late nineteenth century. Though Venezuela was ranked close to Colombia at one time in coffee production, by 2001, it produced less than one percent of the world's coffee. Geography A coffee farm with surrounding mountains in Venezuela Courtyard of a coffee farm Coffee production occurs in the Coast Range and the western Andean region with the only requirements being sufficient top soil and moisture. The coffee production system followed in the Andes region, which is the premontane moist forest, is a multilayered system (3 to 4 layered canopies) in which there are multi-species of plants. In this system, trees provide the shade needed for growth of coffee. This region is a part in the three geographical regions of Venezuela namely, the Mountains and Caribbean Coastal region, the Llanos region, and the Orinoco River Delta region, and the Guayana region. The plantations are generally in the altitudinal range of , bordering with Colombia. Better grades are noted at elevations of or higher but these elevations are characterized by slower growth and lower productivity. The fertile region in the highland areas consisted of T√°chira, M√©rida, and Trujilo, known as the Andean frontier region, and are suitable for growing coffee which could be exported from the Maracaibo's port. This resulted in increased production of coffee in the 19th century. The Duaca region in particular is different from other coffee growing regions in the country; here the growers were, including the wealthy ‚Äúhaciendas‚Äù, till 1916, supported the privatization of land with the objective of forcing higher wages for the labour. It is also the region where, in the 1860s, coffee production boomed as the migrating peasants could resist the hegemony of the large land holders. However, this situation changed between 1908‚Äì1935 when there were political changes resulting in near total privatization of the land in favour of the haciendas resulting in loss of the ‚Äúpeasantry's power‚Äù. The coffee growing area was also extended to marginal agroclimatic region in the elevation range of under 600m , called the premontane dry forest, though the area produced low yields (less than 300 kg per hectare each year), which was made good by the enterprising small farmers with crop diversification. Statistical survey has indicated that coffee plantations are generally in the elevation range of on the hills of the Andean with slopes of 5 to 60%. The land holders were mostly small farmers who accounted for 87.5% of the total land holdings, with each holding of about under coffee and with traditional multilayered agroforestry practice. As a perennial crop, the area covered under coffee was with the Andeas region alone accounting for . History Jos√© Gumilla, a Jesuit priest, is credited with introducing coffee into Venezuela, in 1732. In Venezuela, known as the land of plantations dependent on slave labour, cocoa became the major crop in the 1770s, overshadowing tobacco. From 1793, there were many large coffee plantations in the country. It was only in the 1800s when coffee became the major plantation crop. In the 1830s, Venezuela was the third largest coffee exporter in the world. The war of independence in the country also resulted in decline of growth of cacao due to neglect and destruction. However, growth of coffee took a rising trend as its prices in the North Atlantic nations was booming and Venezuela had free trade agreement with these nations. During the rule of Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco as governor of a few states (from 1871) in the late 1880s when he was known by the epithet ‚ÄúIllustrious American‚Äù, Venezuela witnessed all round development (development of Caracas is largely attributed to him) and coffee production increased rapidly as there was an additional support in the form of loans from foreign countries. While Venezuelan politicians sought unsuccessfully to entice European farmers to the coffee frontier, Andean peasants and others from Colombia spontaneously colonized extensive areas of the mid-slopes suitable for coffee production. Juan Vicente G√≥mez, who ruled the country with an iron grip for 27 years (from 1908 to 1935), beneficially utilized the revenue generated by coffee and petroleum for development activities of the country. In 1919, coffee and cacao constituted 75 percent of the country's exports, the principal market being the U.S. In 2003, the Government of Venezuela introduced policy regulations (fixing procurement price limits) on growing coffee which restricted the production of coffee in the country. Consequently, the imports (to the extent of 50% of local production) become imperative to meet the growing domestic demand. Imports are mostly from Brazil and Nicaragua. It is the contention of the coffee growers that it is no more economical to grow coffee under the present regulations though the government attributes this shortage as due to illegal hoarding by the growers for profit. According to a Coffee growers report, the cost of producing one quintal of top quality coffee was US$335 while its sale price is only US$173 (capped by the government). All these changes have resulted in Venezuela losing its position as one of the world's largest coffee exporters. The future of these changes is unknown in the wake of the death of President of Venezuela, Hugo Ch√°vez, who introduced the policy changes in 2003. Coffee production in the country is now reduced substantially and is only about 1% of world production. Types Coffee tree in Serran√≠a del Interior, near San Juan de los Morros, Venezuela. The ‚ÄúMaracaibos‚Äù coffee exported from the Maracaibo port has sub varieties called Cucuta, M√©rida, Trujillo, and Tachira. The eastern mountains coffee is known as Caracas, named after the capital city. While these are the local varieties of coffee grown in Venezuela, the basic universal coffee varieties under which the Venezuelan one fall under are the arabica (Coffea arabica L.) which grows better in the high land regions, and the Robusta (Coffea canephora p. ex Fr.) which grows in the low land regions; the former variety grows under forest canopy while the latter grows under partial shade. Quality Lavado Fino is the country's highest grade of coffee. The best quality of Venezuelan coffee is reportedly from the western region which borders Colombia. The coffee is shipped from Maracaibo and the coffee is also named as \\"Maracaibos\\"; the coffee grown is characterized as ‚Äúbright flavours with a clean, crisp finish.‚Äù It is also light weight and of simple structure but less acidic as compared with other Latin American coffee. Coffees from the coastal mountains farther east are generally marked Caracas, after the capital city, and are shipped through La Guaira, the port of Caracas. Caripe comes from a mountain range close to the Caribbean and typically displays the soft, gentle profile of the island coffees of the Caribbean. Regardless of market name, the highest grade of Venezuela coffee is Lavado Fino, meaning \\"fine, washed.\\" Production Maracaibo merchants drinking coffee. Coffee trees can be harvested within four years after planting. Each tree lives for about 50 years. While two pickings occur annually (October and November; December, January, and part of February) the latter one provides the larger harvest of the two. However, the picking season does vary by elevation and local conditions such that trees at elevations greater than are harvested later than those in lower elevations. Coffee production peaked to 1 million bags per year before 1914, and after local consumption much of its exports were second only to Brazil. In the Andean frontier region coffee production had increased ten times (between 1830 and 1930) making it the second largest coffee producing nation in the world. More than 82,000 tonnes of coffee were produced in 1919; however, poor agricultural practices, soil erosion, less incidence of rainfall and over use of soil strength caused a drastic decline in the yield, in the 1920s, which resulted in the decline of the coffee industry in the country; petroleum extraction compounded its downfall. Typically, coffee production is at its greatest during the months December and January, and shipping of Venezuelan coffee takes place between October to May. Coffee grown in Venezuela is largely consumed by locals and the rest is sold mainly to the United States, Belgium and Germany. Today Venezuela produces less than one percent of the world‚Äôs coffee, and most of it is drunk by the Venezuelans themselves. However, some interesting Venezuela coffees are again entering the North American specialty market. The best-known Maracaibo coffees, in addition to C√∫cuta, are M√©rida, Trujillo, and T√°chira. M√©rida typically displays fair to good body and an unemphatic but sweetly pleasant flavor with hints of richness. T√°chira and C√∫cuta resemble Colombias, with rich acidity, medium body, and occasional fruitiness.

It typically reaches tall, and has an inflorescence made up of 3‚Äì5 pendent female spikes and a single male spike. It is also used as a garden plant, and has been introduced to North America and New Zealand. Description Carex sylvatica \\"resembles a small C. pendula\\", growing to around tall, or up to in exceptional cases. Its rhizomes are very short, giving the plant a densely cespitose (tufted) form. The leaves are long, wide and thick, with 17‚Äì31 parallel veins. The leaves have a slight keel, or are folded gently into an M-shape in cross-section. The top half or third of the stem bears the inflorescence, typically comprising 3‚Äì5 female spikes and a single apical male spike, which may include a few female flowers at its base. The female spikes are each long, and are held dangling on long, rough peduncles, arising from within a long leaf-sheath. The male spike is much thinner, and is long. Distribution and ecology Carex sylvatica is found across Europe, and into parts of Asia, as far east as Iran. It has also been introduced to North America, where it occurs in Ontario, New York and North Carolina, and to New Zealand, where it was first recorded in 1969. In its native range, C. sylvatica lives in deciduous woodlands on heavy soils; it is sometimes found in unwooded areas, but usually only as a relic of ancient woodland. In North America, it is generally found in disturbed areas within deciduous woodland. Taxonomy Carex sylvatica was first described by the English botanist William Hudson in his 1762 work Flora Anglica. Hybrids have been reported between C. sylvatica and C. strigosa (in France) and between C. sylvatica and C. hirta (in Austria). Its English common name is \\"wood-sedge\\", or, in North America, \\"European woodland sedge\\". Uses Carex sylvatica can be used in gardens as ground cover under trees or shrubs. Carl Linnaeus recorded that the Sami people used the plant as an insulating wadding.

Tropical Depression Thirteen formed on October 22, 1998, over the southwestern Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave that exited Africa on October 10\\\\. It executed a small loop, and while doing so intensified into Tropical Storm Mitch. A weakness in a ridge allowed the storm to track slowly to the north. After becoming disorganized due to wind shear from a nearby upper-level low, Mitch quickly intensified in response to improving conditions which included warm waters and good outflow. It became a hurricane on October 24 and developed an eye. After turning to the west, Mitch rapidly intensified, first into a major hurricane on October 25 and then into a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale the next day. At peak intensity, Mitch maintained maximum sustained winds of 180 mph (285 km/h) while off the northern coast of Honduras. Hurricane Hunters reported a minimum barometric pressure of , which at the time was the lowest in the month of October and tied for the fourth lowest for any Atlantic hurricane. Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and various tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated a turn to the north, threatening the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Instead, Mitch turned to the south due to a ridge that was not observed while the storm was active. Land interaction imparted weakening, and the hurricane made landfall on Honduras on October 29 with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Turning westward, Mitch slowly weakened over land and maintained deep convection over adjacent waters. After moving across mountainous terrain in Central America, the surface circulation of Mitch dissipated on November 1\\\\. The next day, the remnants reached the Gulf of Mexico and reorganized into a tropical storm on November 3\\\\. Mitch accelerated to the northeast ahead of a cold front, moving across the Yucat√°n Peninsula before striking southwestern Florida on November 5\\\\. Shortly thereafter, the storm became an extratropical cyclone, which was tracked by the NHC until November 9\\\\. Origins Tropical Storm Mitch shortly after forming The origin of Hurricane Mitch can be traced to a tropical wave - an elongated area of low air pressure moving from east to west - that moved through western Africa on October 8, as evidenced by radiosonde data. On October 10, the wave exited the coast, and it continued generally westward without development due to strong wind shear. The wave reached the eastern Caribbean Sea on October 18, and over the subsequent few days developed an organizing area of convection, or thunderstorms. The system organized enough to prompt a Hurricane Hunters investigation, which observed a small circulation center and flight-level tropical storm force winds. As a result, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated the system had developed into a tropical cyclone by 0000 UTC on October 22, located 415 mi (665 km) south of Kingston, Jamaica. Upon being classified, Tropical Depression Thirteen was already near tropical storm status, with established outflow. At the time, the circulation was on the northern periphery of the convection. Initially, an upper-level low to the north was shearing the convection, but steady intensification was expected due to generally favorable conditions, with an anticyclone expected to develop aloft. The depression remained nearly stationary in the southwestern Caribbean Sea, eventually executing a small loop about east of San Andr√©s island. The convective structure initially was described as \\"amorphous\\", with two rainbands extending from the center. Late on October 22, the Hurricane Hunters observed flight-level winds of , which indicated surface winds of at least tropical storm-force. Based on the reading, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Mitch. Intensification Mitch near peak intensity north of Honduras on October 26 When Mitch was upgraded to tropical storm status, it had a small radius of maximum winds, only at flight-level. A trough moving through the eastern United States weakened a ridge to the north, allowing the storm to move slowly northward. Additional ridging was forecast to build behind the trough, which would turn Mitch to the west to an area near the Yucat√°n Channel in five days. Significant intensification was initially hampered by the upper-level low to the northwest generating wind shear over Mitch. As a result, the convection weakened on October 23, despite an otherwise improving cloud pattern. Tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated significant strengthening to winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) once an anticyclone aloft became established, although the NHC noted that \\"it [was] difficult to visualize such intensification with the present poorly defined pattern observed on satellite, and knowing that the global models tend to get rid of westerlies too fast.\\" After about 12 hours of being disorganized, the thunderstorms reformed early on October 24, after the upper-level low weakened and shear diminished. An eye quickly formed in the center of the convection. Based on Hurricane Hunter reports of flight-level winds, the NHC upgraded Mitch to hurricane status on October 24\\\\. By that time, the storm was moving slowly to the north, located about south of Kingston. Shortly after becoming a hurricane, Mitch began undergoing rapid deepening. It developed a strong central dense overcast, fueled by low shear and warm water temperatures. The eye became better organized, and after the anticyclone became established, the hurricane developed well-defined outflow in all directions. Early on October 25, Mitch intensified into a major hurricane, which is a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. By that time, the hurricane had begun turning to the west, due to an intensifying ridge over the Gulf of Mexico. With what the NHC described as an \\"ideal environment for strengthening\\", Mitch continued rapidly intensifying. In a 24‚Äëhour period ending late on October 25, the barometric pressure fell to . While it was strengthening, Mitch made its closest point of approach to Jamaica, passing about 230 mi (370 km) west-southwest of the island. The NHC noted the potential for weak steering currents when the hurricane reached the western Caribbean, and the agency anticipated a general northward turn toward the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The NHC estimated that Mitch intensified into a Category 5 hurricane at 1200 UTC on October 26\\\\. At 1900 UTC that day, the Hurricane Hunters observed flight-level winds of in the hurricane's northeastern quadrant, suggesting peak maximum sustained winds of 180 mph (285 km/h). Around the same time, a dropsonde recorded a minimum pressure of . At the time, Mitch was considered the fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane, tied with Hurricane Camille in 1969, and the strongest in the month of October, surpassing Hurricane Hattie in 1961. Both records were surpassed by subsequent hurricanes. At the time, the hurricane was located about 100 mi (160 km) off the north coast of Honduras. Its tropical storm force winds extended 175 mi (280 km) from the center, and hurricane-force winds reached 60 mi (95 km) from the center. Central America landfall While Mitch was at peak intensity, the NHC noted that it was \\"not yet clear which country or countries in the northwest Caribbean are most threatened.\\" By late on October 26, the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS) had forecast the hurricane to continue to the west and strike Belize, while the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) computer model anticipated a general movement to the north in the western Caribbean. Mitch maintained peak winds for about 12 hours, and around that time it moved over Swan Island offshore Honduras. The motion became more westward, despite continued predictions for a northerly turn. The convection around the eye became ragged on October 27. Gradual weakening occurred due to the southern half of the circulation moving across Honduras, which cut off inflow from the south. The eye became less distinct, and early on October 28, Mitch weakened below Category 5 status. Due to a weak mid-level anticyclone over the Gulf of Mexico that was not observed operationally, Mitch began a slow southerly motion on October 27, passing very near Guanaja. The NHC had anticipated the movement to be part of a small loop in the Gulf of Honduras, although the agency noted continued uncertainty. Steadily deteriorating, Mitch weakened below major hurricane intensity late on October 28, due to land interaction, upwelling, and possibly an eyewall replacement cycle. On October 29, the hurricane made landfall in Honduras, east of La Ceiba, with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Despite being over land, the NHC continued to predict a turn to the north, which would allow for restrengthening. Late on October 29, Mitch weakened to tropical storm status. It moved slowly across Honduras, turning to the west. The large circulation dropped heavy rainfall throughout Central America, particularly in Honduras and Nicaragua, causing widespread flooding. While over land, Mitch initially maintained an area of deep convection, which allowed it to maintain tropical storm force winds. On October 31, the circulation became poorly defined while moving over increasingly mountainous terrain; however, the strongest convection persisted over the adjacent Pacific Ocean, and the NHC noted the potential for Mitch to become a Pacific tropical cyclone. Later that day, Mitch weakened into a tropical depression near the border of Guatemala and Honduras. An approaching trough weakened the ridge in the western Gulf of Mexico, allowing Mitch to make the long-intended turn to the northwest. Convection gradually diminished, and the surface circulation of Mitch dissipated on November 1 near the border of Mexico and Guatemala. Regeneration and extratropical transition Mitch as a disorganized tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico Although the surface low pressure center dissipated, the remnants of Mitch maintained a circulation aloft that reached the Bay of Campeche on November 2\\\\. That day, the system began to trigger convection once again. Late on November 3, the Hurricane Hunters observed a well-defined low-level center and flight-level winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). On that basis, the NHC began reissuing advisories on Mitch about 55 mi (90 km) west-southwest of Campeche, Campeche on the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Upon reforming, Mitch was moving to the east-northeast, influenced by an approaching cold front. Early on November 4, Mitch made landfall just north of Campeche with winds of about 40 mph (65 km/h), and it quickly weakened into a tropical depression while crossing the Yucat√°n Peninsula. While Mitch was over eastern Mexico, it had a rainband of deep convection in the eastern periphery. With moderately warm waters and the potential for baroclinity, re-intensification was expected. After emerging into the Gulf of Mexico for a second time on November 4, Mitch restrengthened into a tropical storm, although it was not a purely tropical cyclone; convection was minimal near the core, and the strongest winds were over 230 mi (370 km) from the center. Mitch accelerated toward the coast of Florida as it interacted with the approaching cold front. On November 5, the circulation became elongated, and the NHC commented that \\"if [it] were not the remnants of Mitch, [they] would probably not be calling [it] a tropical cyclone.\\" The storm strengthened to reach winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) before making a final landfall in southwestern Florida near Naples. It quickly crossed the state, producing five tornadoes and tropical storm-force winds, and the storm emerged into the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Late on November 5, a Hurricane Hunters flight could not locate a well-defined center associated with Mitch, instead observing an elongated circulation embedded in the cold front. Based on the observations, the NHC declared Mitch as an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants of Mitch continued quickly to the northeast. On November 6, they passed north of Bermuda, and the following day intensified slightly to winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). By November 9, the remnants passed west of the British Isles, and were last monitored by the NHC later that day.

Her research and teaching explore the institutional nature of social, economic and environmental systems, and the ways in which these are impacted by changing socio-economic spatial and temporal dynamics. Education A native of the Four Corners region of Colorado, Knox-Hayes received her BA (summa cum laude) in International Affairs, Ecology, and Japanese Language and Civilizations from the University of Colorado Boulder in 2004. As an undergraduate, she worked with Professor Alex Cruz on the ethology and reproductive biology of African cichlid and the cuckoo catfish (Synodontis multipunctata). Her research on the subject appeared in the 2004 version of the Encyclopedia of Animal Behavior. Knox-Hayes received her MSc in Nature, Society and Environmental Policy from the University of Oxford. There, she worked with Gordon Clark, then Halford Mackinder Professor of Geography and now Director of the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at Oxford University, on the geographic and socio-demographic characteristics of financial literacy and retirement planning. Knox-Hayes stayed at Oxford for her DPhil, continuing to work with Clark but shifting focus to climate change policy, specifically the role of carbon markets and environmental finance. Career Before starting graduate school, Knox-Hayes worked as an energy analyst for the United States Government Accountability Office. While in graduate school, she served as the president of Oxford Women in Politics, an organization intended to support and empower women in politics. She also worked as an energy analyst for New Energy Finance. In 2009, Knox-Hayes took up her current position as an assistant professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology. There she has taught a range of courses focused on environmental sustainability, environmental finance, and political economy. Knox-Hayes is the author of a number of peer-reviewed works falling broadly into three thematic clusters. The first focuses on the institutional development of environmental markets and includes publications appearing in the Journal of Economic Geography, the Annals of the American Association of Geographers, Competition and Change, Organization and Environment, Regulation and Governance, and Global Environmental Change. This work investigates the political and economic interfaces between financial markets and environmental systems, particularly the political and financial development of carbon emissions markets and other governance mechanisms like carbon disclosure. Topics include the institutional settings and contexts under which markets are developed, the impacts of financial governance on environmental materiality, the nature of coalitions and security in climate policy formation and the changing nature of production systems as spearheaded by carbon markets. The second includes her book and publications in Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, Environment and Planning A, and Pensions and investigates how individuals plan for the future under conditions of economic uncertainty as well as the limits to which individual cognition can accommodate temporal scale. These works explore the spatial nature and temporal scale of individual cognition in retirement planning, the effects of demographic factors on planning preparedness, and the impacts of economic uncertainty. The third concerns the business and organizational implications of tacit knowledge. Knox-Hayes's work on the subject appears in Strategic Organization, and investigates the social and organizational impacts of information liberation and compression. Specifically she is concerned with the nature of spatially and temporally embedded information (through tacit knowledge and culture) and how the liberation of information shapes governance and business operation. Awards Knox-Hayes has been the recipient of a number of prestigious awards. In 2000, she was awarded the Boettcher Scholarship, the oldest and most prestigious undergraduate scholarship in the state of Colorado. In 2005 she was the recipient a 6-year graduate scholarship from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation. Subsequently, she has received funding from the National Science Foundation and Georgia Department of Transportation. From 2012-2013 she held an Abe Fellowship from the Social Science Research Council and in 2014 she was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to study and teach in Iceland Bibliography *Saving for Retirement: Intention, Context, and Behavior with Gordon L.

Pellet's distinctive reddish-brown circular monogram stamp is in the lower-left corner. Gustave Pellet (1859‚Äì1919) was a French publisher of art. He is best known for publishing prints of erotic artworks by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Louis Legrand. Life and work Gustave Jean Baptiste Xavier Pellet was born to a wealthy family. His spend his youth traveling and collecting art books. When the family fortune disappeared in a financial crash in 1886, Pellet decided, with a part of his book collection, to open a library in the Quai Voltaire in Paris. Pellet became a publisher of art books and fine art prints in 1887. He then moved to 51, Rue le Peletier, also in Paris. Pellet owned the rights to the artworks of F√©licien Rops, whose watercolour paintings and drawings he published in a book of a hundred plates engraved by Albert Bertrand, some in colour. Among Pellet's artists were the post- impressionist painters Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Paul Signac. However, the artist that Pellet is best known for, and who he was the first to publish, is the engraver Louis Legrand. Artworks such as proof prints published by Pellet were often marked with his distinctive red monogram stamp. The artworks were often erotic, both Toulouse-Lautrec and before him Legrand making detailed studies of the night life of late nineteenth-century Paris. For example, the 1896 Elles (\\"Women\\") was a series of ten Toulouse-Lautrec lithographs and a frontispiece, which Pellet had printed on high quality wove paper, in a small edition of only 100; the paper was left deckle edged, and was specially watermarked \\"G. Pellet / T. Lautrec\\"; the women are mostly from Paris brothels, and they are shown relaxing, washing and dressing. Pellet inscribed the Elles prints in the lower right corner in pen with brown ink. Pellet published three volumes, Livre d'Heures, La Faune Parisienne, and Po√®mes √† l'Eau-forte (1914), illustrated by Legrand. He published twenty volumes by Toulouse-Lautrec from 1892 onwards. Alongside his book publishing, Pellet also published individual lithographs by artists including Paul Signac, Georges Redon, Maximilien Luce, and Louis Anquetin.

The series was created by J. H. Wyman for Frequency Films, Bad Robot Productions and Warner Bros. Television. Wyman, Bryan Burk and J. J. Abrams are executive producers. After one season, Fox canceled the series on April 29, 2014. Premise In 2048, the uncontrollable evolution of science and technology has caused crime rates to rise an astounding 400%. To combat this, the overwhelmed police force has implemented a new policy: every human police officer is paired with a lifelike combat-model android. John Kennex (Karl Urban), a troubled detective, has a reason to hate these new robot partners. Almost two years previously, Kennex and his squad were raiding the hideout of a violent gang known as InSyndicate, but ended up being ambushed and outgunned. Kennex tried to save his badly injured partner, but the accompanying logic-based android officer abandoned them both because the wounded man's chances of survival were low and it wouldn't have been \\"logical\\" to save him. An explosion then took off Kennex's leg and killed his partner. After waking up from a 17-month coma, Kennex has to deal with a cybernetic prosthetic leg and huge gaps in his memory, which he tries to recover through visits to a black market memory-recovery doctor called a Recollectionist, in the city slums. Besides trying to remember as much as he can about the raid and The Syndicate, he is also coming to terms with being abandoned by his ex-girlfriend Anna. Kennex is then recalled to the force by Captain Sandra Maldonado (Lili Taylor), and partnered with a standard-issue MX-43 android, which he soon throws from a moving vehicle, when it threatens to report his unusual behavior. He is assigned a replacement android, an older DRN model originally decommissioned for police work and about to be transferred to the Space Station.Episode \\"Straw Man\\" Created to be as close to human as possible, the DRN androids have trouble dealing with some of their own emotional responses, which was the reason they were replaced by the logic-based MX units. Kennex's unit, known as Dorian (Michael Ealy), immediately proves himself unique, with a clear dislike of being referred to as a \\"synthetic\\", and a dry, friendly, sarcasm-oriented wit. Key to the story arc is the growth and development of Kennex and Dorian's relationship. Cast and characters *Karl Urban as John Kennex, a detective who lost a leg after a Synthetic left him behind because he and his partner had a low chance of survival. He awakes from a coma 17 months later, to find his leg has been replaced with a synthetic prosthetic and returns to duty. *Michael Ealy as DRN-0167,episode \\"You Are Here\\" called \\"Dorian\\", a retired DRN model Police Synthetic.

Other Chromes consider her choice of profession to be a waste of potential. *Mackenzie Crook as Rudy Lom, a technician. *Michael Irby as Richard Paul, a detective. *Lili Taylor as Captain Sandra Maldonado. Episodes Development and production The main cast of Almost Human The series first appeared as part of Fox's development slate in September 2012. In January 2013, Fox green-lit production of a pilot episode. On May 8, 2013, the series was added to the network's 2013‚Äì14 schedule. On September 9, 2013, it was announced that executive producer and co-showrunner Naren Shankar, who joined the series after the production of the pilot, would depart the series due to creative differences, while creator J. H. Wyman would continue as sole showrunner. The series was originally scheduled to premiere on Monday, November 4, 2013. Fox announced a two-week delay and that the series would instead premiere with a special preview on Sunday, November 17 before moving to its regular time slot starting on Monday, November 18. The order of the episodes that aired on Fox differs from the order intended by J. H. Wyman, the series' showrunner. However, due to the (largely) self-contained nature of these episodes, this does not create significant discontinuity in the events of the series however the relationship between Detective Kennex and Dorian with increased closeness and trust over the arc of the original sequence of shows is uneven in the televised sequence of shows. The following list of episodes is in the order televised with each show's original order in parenthesis. * 01 Pilot (#01) * 02 \\"Skin\\"- (#05) * 03 \\"Are You Receiving\\" ‚Äì (#06) * 04 \\"The Bends\\" ‚Äì (#07) * 05 \\"Blood Brothers\\" ‚Äì (#08) * 06 \\"Arrhythmia\\" ‚Äì (#03) * 07 \\"Simon Says\\" ‚Äì (#10) * 08 \\"You Are Here\\" ‚Äì (#02) * 09 \\"Unbound\\" ‚Äì (#09) * 10 \\"Perception\\" ‚Äì (#04) * 11 \\"Disrupt\\" ‚Äì (#11) * 12 \\"Beholder\\" ‚Äì (#12) * 13 \\"Straw Man\\" ‚Äì (#13) Despite renewal consideration (and a loyal following) on April 29, Fox cancelled the series after only one season due to low ratings, high production costs and FOX's already full scheduling for fall, with Ealy acknowledging that the show required \\"CSI numbers\\" in order to continue. Reception Metacritic gave the pilot episode a weighted average rating of 61% based on reviews from 29 critics. Kevin McFarland reviewing for The A.V. Club gave the pilot episode a C+ grade, criticizing the information- heavy introduction and title card, but noting \\"flashes of excitement\\" and expressing interest in how the plot gets teased out and how the detective partnership develops. The grades do improve, garnering a B‚àí for episodes two, three, and four, a B for episode five, and an A‚àí for episode six. The series received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Special and Visual Effects. U.S. ratings Broadcast The series was shown in the United Kingdom on Watch on May 6, 2014.

The name refers to the eponymous drama film directed by Ugo Gregoretti in 1962.  Biography  I Nuovi Angeli formed in 1966 from the merging of two bands ‚Äì Paki & Paki (a pop duo formed in Milan by Pasquale Canzi and Pasquale Andriola) and an instrumental trio from Alessandria consisting in Alberto Pasetti (bass), Renato Sabbioni (guitar) and Franco Verde (drums). The band, initially called Paki & Paki and I Nuovi Angeli, achieved some success when their first single, L'ora pi√π lunga (1966), who was adopted as the opening theme for the RAI TV show \\"La fiera dei sogni\\" hosted by Mike Bongiorno. In 1967 Andriola and Verde left the project due to creative differences, and the band was simply renamed I Nuovi Angeli. Augmented by The New Dada former drummer Riki Rebaioli and lead singer Alfredo Gatti, I Nuovi Angeli recorded two more singles characterized by a beat production. In the late 1960s, following the departure of Gatti, the group replaced Rebaioli with Mauro Paoluzzi and left Durium Records to sign with Polygram. The move coincided with a change of musical direction, with the band turning towards the bubblegum genre. The classic line-up of I Nuovi Angeli peaked in the early 1970s, thanks to a string of top-ten hits written by Renato Pareti and Roberto Vecchioni, including Donna Felicit√† (1971), Uakadi Uakad√π (1971), Singapore (1972) and Anna da dimenticare (1973). In 1971 I Nuovi Angeli embarked on a North-American tour and made their first TV appareance in America on the Ed Sullivan Show. In 1974 I Nuovi Angeli recorded Stasera Clown, a concept album in collaboration with the La Scala Orchestra revolving around the live of a group of circus artists. With the advent of disco and punk music, I Nuovi Angeli experienced a decline in popularity. In 1978 Paoluzzi left the band to purchase a successful career as producer, songwriter session musician, collaborating with artists like Gianna Nannini and Patty Pravo. Sabbioni and Pasetti left the band a few months later and retired from the music industry. Canzi decided to continue with new musicians. In 2005 the original members of I Nuovi Angeli met to discuss the possibility of a reunion. The band played a few warm-up gigs and recorded a double live album, \\"Il nostro concerto\\" but tragedy struck when Alberto Pasetti suddenly passed away at the age of 54. Following a legal battle between Sabbioni and Canzi over the property of the name I Nuovi Angeli, Canzi temporarily left the group. Despite numerous lineup changes, the band is still active.

The mutation has a unit if and only if the given element is invertible, in which case the mutation is called a proper mutation or an isotope. Mutations were first introduced by Max Koecher in his Jordan algebraic approach to Hermitian symmetric spaces and bounded symmetric domains of tube type. Their functorial properties allow an explicit construction of the corresponding Hermitian symmetric space of compact type as a compactification of a finite-dimensional complex semisimple Jordan algebra. The automorphism group of the compactification becomes a complex subgroup, the complexification of its maximal compact subgroup. Both groups act transitively on the compactification. The theory has been extended to cover all Hermitian symmetric spaces using the theory of Jordan pairs or Jordan triple systems. Koecher obtained the results in the more general case directly from the Jordan algebra case using the fact that only Jordan pairs associated with period two automorphisms of Jordan algebras are required. Definitions Let A be a unital Jordan algebra over a field k of characteristic ‚â† 2.See: * * * For a in A define the Jordan multiplication operator on A by :\\\\displaystyle{L(a)b=ab} and the quadratic representation Q(a) by : Q(a)=2L(a)^2 -L(a^2). \\\\, It satisfies :Q(1)=I. \\\\, the fundamental identity :\\\\displaystyle{Q(Q(a)b)=Q(a)Q(b)Q(a)} the commutation or homotopy identity :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)R(b,a)=R(a,b)Q(a) = 2Q(Q(a)b,a),} where : R(a,b)c=2Q(a,c)b,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, Q(x,y)=\\\\frac{1}{2} (Q(x+y)-Q(x)-Q(y)). In particular if a or b is invertible then :\\\\displaystyle{R(a,b)=2Q(a)Q(a^{-1},b)=2Q(a,b^{-1})Q(b).} It follows that A with the operations Q and R and the identity element defines a quadratic Jordan algebra, where a quadratic Jordan algebra consists of a vector space A with a distinguished element 1 and a quadratic map of A into endomorphisms of A, a ‚Ü¶ Q(a), satisfying the conditions: * * (\\"fundamental identity\\") * (\\"commutation or homotopy identity\\"), where The Jordan triple product is defined by : \\\\\\\\{a,b,c\\\\\\\\}=(ab)c+(cb)a -(ac)b, \\\\, so that : Q(a)b=\\\\\\\\{a,b,a\\\\\\\\},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, Q(a,c)b=\\\\\\\\{a,b,c\\\\\\\\},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, R(a,b)c=\\\\\\\\{a,b,c\\\\\\\\}. \\\\, There are also the formulas : Q(a,b)=L(a)L(b)+L(b)L(a) - L(ab),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, R(a,b)= [L(a),L(b)] + L(ab). \\\\, For y in A the mutation Ay is defined to the vector space A with multiplication : a\\\\circ b= \\\\\\\\{a,y,b\\\\\\\\}. \\\\, If Q(y) is invertible, the mutual is called a proper mutation or isotope. Quadratic Jordan algebras Let A be a quadratic Jordan algebra over a field k of characteristic ‚â† 2. Following , a linear Jordan algebra structure can be associated with A such that, if L(a) is Jordan multiplication, then the quadratic structure is given by Q(a) = 2L(a)2 ‚àí L(a2). Firstly the axiom Q(a)R(b,a) = R(a,b)Q(a) can be strengthened to :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)R(b,a)=R(a,b)Q(a)=2Q(Q(a)b,a).} Indeed, applied to c, the first two terms give :\\\\displaystyle{2Q(a)Q(b,c)a=2Q(Q(a)c,a)b.} Switching b and c then gives :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)R(b,a)c=2Q(Q(a)b,a)c.} Now let :\\\\displaystyle{L(a)=\\\\frac{1}{2}R(a,1).} Replacing b by a and a by 1 in the identity above gives :\\\\displaystyle{R(a,1)=R(1,a)=2Q(a,1).} In particular :\\\\displaystyle{L(a)=Q(a,1),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,L(1)=Q(1,1)=I.} The Jordan product is given by :\\\\displaystyle{a\\\\circ b = L(a)b=\\\\frac{1}{2}R(a,1)b=Q(a,b)1,} so that :\\\\displaystyle{a\\\\circ b = b \\\\circ a.} The formula above shows that 1 is an identity. Defining a2 by a‚àòa = Q(a)1, the only remaining condition to be verified is the Jordan identity :\\\\displaystyle{[L(a),L(a^2)]=0.} In the fundamental identity :\\\\displaystyle{Q(Q(a)b)= Q(a)Q(b)Q(a),} Replace a by a + t1, set b = 1 and compare the coefficients of t2 on both sides: :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)=2Q(a,1)^2 - Q(a^2,1)= 2L(a)^2 - L(a^2).} Setting b = 1 in the second axiom gives :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)L(a)=L(a)Q(a),} and therefore L(a) must commute with L(a2). Inverses Let A be a unital Jordan algebra over a field k of characteristic ‚â† 2. An element a in a unital Jordan algebra A is said to be invertible if there is an element b such that ab = 1 and a2b = a.See:  Properties.See: * * If and , then . The Jordan identity can be polarized by replacing by and taking the coefficient of . This gives :\\\\displaystyle{[L(x^2),L(y)]+2[L(xy),L(x)]=0.} Taking or and or shows that commutes with and commutes with . Hence . Applying gives . Hence . Conversely if and , then the second relation gives . So both and are invertible. The first gives so that and are each other's inverses. Since commutes with it commutes with its inverse . Similarly commutes with . So and . Indeed, if is invertible then the above implies is invertible with inverse . Any inverse b satisfies , so . Conversely if is invertible let . Then . The fundamental identity then implies that and are each other's inverses so that . This follows from the formula . Suppose that . Then by the fundamental identity is invertible, so is invertible. This is an immediate consequence of the fundamental identity and the fact that is invertible if and only and are invertible. In the commutation identity , set with . Then and . Since commutes with , . If and commute, then implies . Conversely suppose that is invertible with inverse . Then . Morevoer commutes with and hence its inverse . So it commutes with . The algebra is commutative and associative, so if is an inverse there and . Conversely leaves invariant. So if it is bijective on it is bijective there. Thus lies in . Elementary properties of proper mutations In fact See:  multiplication in the algebra Ay is given by :\\\\displaystyle{a\\\\circ b = \\\\\\\\{a,y,b\\\\\\\\},} so by definition is commutative. It follows that :\\\\displaystyle{a\\\\circ b = L_y(a)b,} with :\\\\displaystyle{L_y(a)=[L(a),L(y)] + L(ay).} If e satisfies , then taking a = 1 gives :\\\\displaystyle{ye=1.} Taking a = e gives :\\\\displaystyle{e(ya)=y(ea)} so that L(y) and L(e) commute. Hence y is invertible and e = y‚àí1. Now for y invertible set :\\\\displaystyle{Q_y(a)=Q(a)Q(y),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, R_y(a,b)=R(a,Q(y)b).} Then :\\\\displaystyle{Q_y(e)=Q_y(y^{-1})= Q(y^{-1})Q(y)=I.} Moreover, :\\\\displaystyle{Q_y(a)Q_y(b)Q_y(a)=Q(a)Q(y)Q(b)Q(y)Q(a)Q(y)=Q(a) Q(Q(y)b) Q(a)Q(y) = Q(Q(a)Q(y)b)Q(y)=Q_y(Q_y(a)b).} Finally :\\\\displaystyle{Q(y)R(c,Q(y)d)Q(y)^{-1}=R(Q(y)c,d),} since :\\\\displaystyle{Q(y)R(c,Q(y)d)x=2Q(y)Q(c,x)Q(y)d=2Q(Q(y)c,Q(y)x)d=R(Q(y)c,d)Q(y)x.} Hence :\\\\displaystyle{Q_y(a)R_y(b,a)=Q(a)Q(y)R(b,Q(y)a)=Q(y^{-1}) Q(Q(y)a)R(b,Q(y)a)= Q(y)^{-1} R(Q(y)a,b)Q(Q(y)a)=R_y(a,b) Q_y(a).} Thus is a unital quadratic Jordan algebra. It therefore corresponds to a linear Jordan algebra with the associated Jordan multiplication operator M(a) given by :\\\\displaystyle{M(a)b=\\\\frac{1}{2} R_y(a,e)b= \\\\frac{1}{2} R(a,Q(y)e)b= \\\\frac{1}{2}R(a,y)b=\\\\\\\\{a,y,b\\\\\\\\}=L_y(a)b.} This shows that the operators satisfy the Jordan identity so that the proper mutation or isotope is a unital Jordan algebra. The correspondence with quadratic Jordan algebras shows that its quadratic representation is given by . Nonunital mutations The definition of mutation also applies to non-invertible elements y. If A is finite- dimensional over R or C, invertible elements a in A are dense, since invertibility is equivalent to the condition that det Q(a) ‚â† 0. So by continuity the Jordan identity for proper mutations implies the Jordan identity for arbitrary mutations. In general the Jordan identity can be deduced from Macdonald's theorem for Jordan algebras because it involves only two elements of the Jordan algebra. Alternatively, the Jordan identity can be deduced by realizing the mutation inside a unital quadratic algebra.See:  For a in A define a quadratic structure on A1 = A ‚äï k by \\\\displaystyle{Q_1(a\\\\oplus \\\\alpha 1)(b\\\\oplus \\\\beta 1)= \\\\alpha^2\\\\beta 1\\\\oplus [\\\\alpha^2 a + \\\\alpha^2 b + 2\\\\alpha\\\\beta a + \\\\alpha \\\\\\\\{a,y, b\\\\\\\\} + \\\\beta Q(a)y + Q(a)Q(y)b].} It can then be verified that is a unital quadratic Jordan algebra. The unital Jordan algebra to which it corresponds has Ay as an ideal, so that in particular Ay satisfies the Jordan identity. The identities for a unital quadratic Jordan algebra follow from the following compatibility properties of the quadratic map and the squaring map :  * . Hua's identity Let A be a unital Jordan algebra. If a, b and a ‚Äì b are invertible, then Hua's identity holds: In particular if x and 1 ‚Äì x are invertible, then so too is 1 ‚Äì x‚àí1 with :\\\\displaystyle{(1-x)^{-1} + (1-x^{-1})^{-1} = 1.} To prove the identity for x, set . Then . Thus commutes with and . Since , it also commutes with and . Since , also commutes with and . It follows that . Moreover, since . So commutes with and hence . Thus has inverse . Now let be the mutation of A defined by a. The identity element of is . Moreover, an invertible element c in A is also invertible in with inverse . Let in . It is invertible in A, as is . So by the special case of Hua's identity for x in :\\\\displaystyle{a^{-1}= Q(a)^{-1}(a^{-1} - Q(a)^{-1}b)^{-1} + Q(a)^{-1}(a^{-1} - b^{-1})^{-1}= (a -b)^{-1} + (a-Q(a)b^{-1})^{-1}.} Bergman operator If A is a unital Jordan algebra, the Bergman operator is defined for a, b in A by :\\\\displaystyle{B(a,b) = I - R(a,b) + Q(a)Q(b).} If a is invertible then :\\\\displaystyle{B(a,b)=Q(a)Q(a^{-1}-b);} while if b is invertible then :\\\\displaystyle{B(a,b)=Q(a-b^{-1})Q(b).} In fact if a is invertible : and similarly if b is invertible. More generally the Bergman operator satisfies a version of the commutation or homotopy identity: and a version of the fundamental identity: There is also a third more technical identity: Quasi- invertibility Let A be a finite-dimensional unital Jordan algebra over a field k of characteristic ‚â† 2.In the main application in , A is finite dimensional. In that case invertibility of operators on A is equivalent to injectivity or surjectivity. The general case is treated in and . For a pair with and invertible define In this case the Bergman operator defines an invertible operator on A and In fact :\\\\displaystyle{B(a,b)^{-1}(a-Q(a)b)= Q(a^b)Q(a^{-1})(a-Q(a)b)=Q(a^b)(a^b)^{-1}=a^b.} Moreover, by definition is invertible if and only if is invertible. In that case Indeed, :\\\\displaystyle{a^{b+c}=((a^{-1} - b) -c)^{-1} = ((a^b)^{-1} -c)^{-1}=(a^b)^c.} The assumption that be invertible can be dropped since can be defined only supposing that the Bergman operator is invertible. The pair is then said to be quasi-invertible. In that case is defined by the formula :\\\\displaystyle{a^b = B(a,b)^{-1}(a-Q(a)b).} If is invertible, then for some . The fundamental identity implies that . So by finite-dimensionality is invertible. Thus is invertible if and only if is invertible and in this case In fact : so the formula follows by applying to both sides. As before is quasi-invertible if and only if is quasi-invertible; and in that case :\\\\displaystyle{a^{b+c}=(a^b)^c.} If k = R or C, this would follow by continuity from the special case where and were invertible. In general the proof requires four identities for the Bergman operator: In fact applying to the identity yields :\\\\displaystyle{B(a,b)Q(a^b)B(b,a)=B(a,b)Q(a)=Q(a)B(b,a).} The first identity follows by cancelling and . The second identity follows by similar cancellation in :. The third identity follows by applying the second identity to an element d and then switching the roles of c and d. The fourth follows because :. In fact is quasi-invertible if and only if is quasi- invertible in the mutation . Since this mutation might not necessarily unital this means that when an identity is adjoint becomes invertible in . This condition can be expressed as follows without mentioning the mutation or homotope: In fact if is quasi-invertible, then satisfies the first identity by definition. The second follows because . Conversely the conditions state that in the conditions imply that is the inverse of . On the other hand, for in . Hence is invertible. Equivalence relation Let A be a finite-dimensional unital Jordan algebra over a field k of characteristic ‚â† 2. Two pairs with invertible are said to be equivalent if is invertible and . This is an equivalence relation, since if is invertible so that a pair is equivalent to itself. It is symmetric since from the definition . It is transitive. For suppose that is a third pair with invertible and . From the above :\\\\displaystyle{a_1^{-1} - b_1 + b_3= (a_1^{-1} - b_1 +b_2) -b_2 + b_3=a_2^{-1} -b_2+b_3} is invertible and :\\\\displaystyle{a_3=a_2^{b_2-b_3}=(a_1^{b_1-b_2})^{b_2-b_3}=a_1^{b_1-b_3}.} As for quasi-invertibility, this definition can be extended to the case where and are not assumed to be invertible. Two pairs are said to be equivalent if is quasi-invertible and . When k = R or C, the fact that this more general definition also gives an equivalence relation can deduced from the invertible case by continuity. For general k, it can also be verified directly: * The relation is reflexive since is quasi-invertible and . *The relation is symmetric, since . *The relation is transitive. For suppose that is a third pair with quasi-invertible and . In this case ::\\\\displaystyle{B(a_1,b_1-b_3)=B(a_1,b_1-b_2)B(a_2,b_2-b_3),} :so that is quasi-invertible with ::\\\\displaystyle{a_3=a_2^{b_2-b_3}=(a_1^{b_1-b_2})^{b_2-b_3}=a_1^{b_1-b_3}.} The equivalence class of is denoted by . Structure groups Let be a finite- dimensional complex semisimple unital Jordan algebra. If is an operator on , let be its transpose with respect to the trace form. Thus , , and . The structure group of A consists of g in such that :\\\\displaystyle{Q(ga)=gQ(a)g^t.} They form a group . The automorphism group Aut A of A consists of invertible complex linear operators g such that L(ga) = gL(a)g‚àí1 and g1 = 1. Since an automorphism g preserves the trace form, g‚àí1 = gt. *The structure group is closed under taking transposes g ‚Ü¶ gt and adjoints g ‚Ü¶ g*. *The structure group contains the automorphism group. The automorphism group can be identified with the stabilizer of 1 in the structure group. *If a is invertible, Q(a) lies in the structure group. *If g is in the structure group and a is invertible, ga is also invertible with (ga)‚àí1 = (gt)‚àí1a‚àí1. * The structure group Œì(A) acts transitively on the set of invertible elements in A. * Every g in Œì(A) has the form g = h Q(a) with h an automorphism and a invertible. The complex Jordan algebra A is the complexification of a real Euclidean Jordan algebra E, for which the trace form defines an inner product. There is an associated involution on which gives rise to a complex inner product on . The unitary structure group Œìu(A) is the subgroup of Œì(A) consisting of unitary operators, so that . The identity component of is denoted by . It is a connected closed subgroup of . * The stabilizer of 1 in Œìu(A) is Aut E. * Every g in Œìu(A) has the form g = h Q(u) with h in Aut E and u invertible in A with u* = u‚àí1. * Œì(A) is the complexification of Œìu(A). * The set S of invertible elements u in A such that u* = u‚àí1 can be characterized equivalently either as those u for which L(u) is a normal operator with uu* = 1 or as those u of the form exp ia for some a in E. In particular S is connected. * The identity component of Œìu(A) acts transitively on S * Given a Jordan frame (ei) and v in A, there is an operator u in the identity component of Œìu(A) such that uv = ‚àë Œ±i ei with Œ±i ‚â• 0. If v is invertible, then Œ±i > 0. The structure group Œì(A) acts naturally on X. For g in Œì(A), set :\\\\displaystyle{g(a,b)=(ga,(g^t)^{-1}b).} Then is quasi-invertible if and only if is quasi-invertible and :\\\\displaystyle{g(x^y)=(gx)^{(g^t)^{-1}y}.} In fact the covariance relations for g with Q and the inverse imply that :\\\\displaystyle{gB(x,y)g^{-1}=B(gx,(g^t)^{-1}y)} if x is invertible and so everywhere by density. In turn this implies the relation for the quasi- inverse. If a is invertible then Q(a) lies in Œì(A) and if (a,b) is quasi- invertible B(a,b) lies in Œì(A). So both types of operators act on X. The defining relations for the structure group show that it is a closed subgroup of \\\\mathfrak{g}_0 of . Since , the corresponding complex Lie algebra contains the operators . The commutators span the complex Lie algebra of derivations of . The operators span \\\\mathfrak{g}_0 and satisfy and . Geometric properties of quotient space Let A be a finite-dimensional complex unital Jordan algebra which is semisimple, i.e. the trace form Tr L(ab) is non-degenerate. Let be the quotient of by the equivalence relation. Let be the subset of X of classes . The map , is injective. A subset of is defined to be open if and only if is open for all . The transition maps of the atlas with charts are given by :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\varphi_{cb}=\\\\varphi_c\\\\circ\\\\varphi_b^{-1}:\\\\varphi_b(X_b\\\\cap X_c)\\\\rightarrow \\\\varphi_c(X_b\\\\cap X_c).} and are injective and holomorphic since :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\varphi_{cb}(a)=a^{b-c}} with derivative :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\varphi_{cb}^\\\\prime(a)=B(a,b-c)^{-1}.} This defines the structure of a complex manifold on X because on . Indeed, all the polynomial functions are non-trivial since . Therefore, there is a such that for all i, which is precisely the criterion for to lie in . uses the Bergman operators to construct an explicit biholomorphism between X and a closed smooth algebraic subvariety of complex projective space. This implies in particular that is compact. There is a more direct proof of compactness using symmetry groups. Given a Jordan frame (ei) in E, for every a in A there is a k in U = Œìu(A) such that with (and if a is invertible). In fact, if (a,b) is in X then it is equivalent to k(c,d) with c and d in the unital Jordan subalgebra , which is the complexification of . Let be the complex manifold constructed for . Because is a direct sum of copies of C, Z is just a product of Riemann spheres, one for each . In particular it is compact. There is a natural map of Z into X which is continuous. Let Y be the image of Z. It is compact and therefore coincides with the closure of Y0 = Ae ‚äÇ A = X0. The set U‚ãÖY is the continuous image of the compact set U √ó Y. It is therefore compact. On the other hand, U‚ãÖY0 = X0, so it contains a dense subset of X and must therefore coincide with X. So X is compact. The above argument shows that every (a,b) in X is equivalent to k(c,d) with c and d in and k in . The mapping of Z into X is in fact an embedding. This is a consequence of being quasi-invertible in if and only if it is quasi-invertible in . Indeed, if is injective on A, its restriction to is also injective. Conversely, the two equations for the quasi- inverse in imply that it is also a quasi-inverse in . M√∂bius transformations Let be a finite-dimensional complex semisimple unital Jordan algebra. The group SL(2,C) acts by M√∂bius transformation on the Riemann sphere C ‚à™ {‚àû}, the one-point compactification of C. If g in SL(2,C) is given by the matrix :\\\\displaystyle{g=\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\alpha & \\\\beta \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma & \\\\delta\\\\end{pmatrix},} then :\\\\displaystyle{g(z)=(\\\\alpha z +\\\\beta)(\\\\gamma z +\\\\delta)^{-1}.} There is a generalization of this action of SL(2,C) to A and its compactification X. In order to define this action, note that SL(2,C) is generated by the three subgroups of lower and upper unitriangular matrices and the diagonal matrices. It is also generated by the lower (or upper) unitriangular matrices, the diagonal matrices and the matrix :\\\\displaystyle{J=\\\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 0\\\\end{pmatrix}.} The matrix J corresponds to the M√∂bius transformation and can be written :\\\\displaystyle{J=\\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 1\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1\\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 1\\\\end{pmatrix}.} The M√∂bius transformations fixing ‚àû are just the upper triangular matrices. If g does not fix ‚àû, it sends ‚àû to a finite point a. But then g can be composed with an upper unitriangular to send a to 0 and then with J to send 0 to infinity. For an element of , the action of in SL(2,C) is defined by the same formula :\\\\displaystyle{g(a)=(\\\\alpha a +\\\\beta 1)(\\\\gamma a +\\\\delta 1)^{-1}.} This defines an element of provided that is invertible in . The action is thus defined everywhere on if g is upper triangular. On the other hand, the action on X is simple to define for lower triangular matrices.See:  *For diagonal matrices g with diagonal entries and , is a well-defined holomorphic action on which passes to the quotient X. On it agrees with the M√∂bius action. *For lower unitriangular matrices, with off-diagonal parameter Œ≥, define . Again this is holomorphic on and passes to the quotient X. When and , ::\\\\displaystyle{g(a:0)=(a:-\\\\gamma)= (a^{-\\\\gamma}:0)= (a(\\\\gamma a +1 )^{-1}:0)} :if is invertible, so this is an extension of the M√∂bius action. *For upper unitriangular matrices, with off-diagonal parameter Œ≤, the action on is defined by . showed that this defined a complex one-parameter flow on . The corresponding holomorphic complex vector field extended to , so that the action on the compact complex manifold could be defined by the associated complex flow. A simpler method is to note that the operator can be implemented directly using its intertwining relations with the unitary structure group. In fact on the invertible elements in A, the operator satisfies . To define a biholomorphism j on X such that , it is enough to define these for in some suitable orbit of Œì(A) or Œìu(A). On the other hand, as indicated above, given a Jordan frame (ei) in E, for every a in A there is a k in U = Œìu(A) such that with . The computation of in the associative commutative algebra is straightforward since it is a direct product. For and , the Bergman operator on has determinant . In particular for some Œª ‚â† 0. So that is equivalent to . Let . On , for a dense set of , the pair is equivalent to with b invertible. Then is equivalent to . Since is holomorphic it follows that j has a unique continuous extension to X such that for in , the extension is holomorphic and for , The holomorphic transformations corresponding to upper unitriangular matrices can be defined using the fact that they are the conjugates by J of lower unitriangular matrices, for which the action is already known. A direct algebraic construction is given in . This action of is compatible with inclusions. More generally if is a Jordan frame, there is an action of on Ae which extends to A. If and , then and give the action of the product of the lower and upper unitriangular matrices. If is invertible, the corresponding product of diagonal matrices act as . In particular the diagonal matrices give an action of and . Holomorphic symmetry group Let be a finite-dimensional complex semisimple unital Jordan algebra. There is a transitive holomorphic action of a complex matrix group on the compact complex manifold . described analogously to in terms of generators and relations. acts on the corresponding finite-dimensional Lie algebra of holomorphic vector fields restricted to , so that is realized as a closed matrix group. It is the complexification of a compact Lie group without center, so a semisimple algebraic group. The identity component of the compact group acts transitively on , so that can be identified as a Hermitian symmetric space of compact type.See:  The group G is generated by three types of holomorphic transformation on : *Operators W corresponding to elements W in given by . These were already described above. On , they are given by . *Operators Sc defined by . These are the analogue of lower unitriangular matrices and form a subgroup isomorphic to the additive group of , with the given parametrization. Again these act holomorphically on and the action passes to the quotient X. On the action is given by if is quasi-invertible. *The transformation corresponding to in . It was constructed above as part of the action of } on . On invertible elements in it is given by . The operators normalize the group of operators . Similarly the operator normalizes the structure group, . The operators also form a group of holomorphic transformations isomorphic to the additive group of . They generalize the upper unitriangular subgroup of . This group is normalized by the operators W of the structure group. The operator acts on as . If is a scalar the operators and coincide with the operators corresponding to lower and upper unitriangular matrices in . Accordingly, there is a relation and is a subgroup of G. defines the operators in terms of the flow associated to a holomorphic vector field on , while give a direct algebraic description. Indeed, . Let and be the complex Abelian groups formed by the symmetries and respectively. Let . The two expressions for are equivalent as follows by conjugating by . For invertible, Hua's identity can be rewritten :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)=T_a \\\\circ j \\\\circ T_{a^{-1}}\\\\circ j \\\\circ T_a \\\\circ j.} Moreover, and . The convariance relations show that the elements of fall into sets , , , . ... The first expression for follows once it is established that no new elements appear in the fourth or subsequent sets. For this it suffices to show that :. For then if there are three or more occurrences of , the number can be recursively reduced to two. Given in , pick so that and are invertible. Then :\\\\displaystyle{j T_a j T_b j = j T_c T_\\\\lambda j T_{\\\\lambda^{-1}} T_d \\\\circ j = \\\\lambda^2 j T_c j T_{-\\\\lambda} j T_d \\\\ j = \\\\lambda^2 T_{-c^{-1}} j Q(c^{-1})T_{-c^{-1} -\\\\lambda - d^{-1}} j Q(d^{-1})jT_{-d^{-1}},} which lies in . It suffices to check that if , then . If so , so . Exchange relations For invertible, Hua's identity can be rewritten :\\\\displaystyle{Q(a)=T_a \\\\circ j \\\\circ T_{a^{-1}}\\\\circ j \\\\circ T_a \\\\circ j.} Since , the operators belong to the group generated by . For quasi- invertible pairs , there are the \\"exchange relations\\" This identity shows that is in the group generated by . Taking inverses, it is equivalent to the identity . To prove the exchange relations, it suffices to check that it valid when applied to points the dense set of points in for which is quasi- invertible. It then reduces to the identity: In fact, if is quasi-invertible, then is quasi-invertible if and only if is quasi-invertible. This follows because is quasi-invertible if and only if is. Moreover, the above formula holds in this case. For the proof, two more identities are required: :\\\\displaystyle{B(c+b,a)=B(c,a^b)B(b,a)} :\\\\displaystyle{R(a,b)=R(a^b,b-Q(b)a)=R(a-Q(a)b,b^a)} The first follows from a previous identity by applying the transpose. For the second, because of the transpose, it suffices to prove the first equality. Setting in the identity yields : so the identity follows by cancelling . To prove the formula, the relations and show that it is enough to prove that : Indeed, . On the other hand, and . So . Now set . Then the exchange relations imply that lies in if and only if is quasi-invertible; and that lies in if and only if is in . In fact if lies in , then is equivalent to , so it a quasi-invertible pair; the converse follows from the exchange relations. Clearly . The converse follows from and the criterion for to lie in . Lie algebra of holomorphic vector fields The compact complex manifold is modelled on the space . The derivatives of the transition maps describe the tangent bundle through holomorphic transition functions . These are given by , so the structure group of the corresponding principal fiber bundle reduces to , the structure group of .See: * * The corresponding holomorphic vector bundle with fibre is the tangent bundle of the complex manifold . Its holomorphic sections are just holomorphic vector fields on X. They can be determined directly using the fact that they must be invariant under the natural adjoint action of the known holomorphic symmetries of X. They form a finite-dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebra. The restriction of these vector fields to X0 can be described explicitly. A direct consequence of this description is that the Lie algebra is three-graded and that the group of holomorphic symmetries of X, described by generators and relations in and , is a complex linear semisimple algebraic group that coincides with the group of biholomorphisms of X. The Lie algebras of the three subgroups of holomorphic automorphisms of give rise to linear spaces of holomorphic vector fields on and hence . *The structure group has Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}_0 spanned by the operators . These define a complex Lie algebra of linear vector fields on . *The translation operators act on as . The corresponding one-parameter subgroups are given by and correspond to the constant vector fields . These give an Abelian Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}_{-1} of vector fields on . *The operators defined on by . The corresponding one- parameter groups define quadratic vector fields on . These give an Abelian Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}_{1} of vector fields on . Let :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{g}=\\\\mathfrak{g}_{-1}\\\\oplus\\\\mathfrak{g}_0\\\\oplus\\\\mathfrak{g}_1.} Then, defining \\\\mathfrak{g}_i = (0) for , \\\\mathfrak{g} forms a complex Lie algebra with :\\\\displaystyle{[\\\\mathfrak{g}_p,\\\\mathfrak{g}_q]\\\\subseteq \\\\mathfrak{g}_{p+q}}. This gives the structure of a 3-graded Lie algebra. For elements in \\\\mathfrak{g}, the Lie bracket is given by :\\\\displaystyle{[(a_1,T_1,b_1),(a_2,T_2,b_2)]=(T_1a_2-T_2a_1,[T_1,T_2]+R(a_1,b_2)-R(a_2,b_1),T_2^tb_1-T_1^tb_2)} The group of M√∂bius transformations of X normalizes the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}. The transformation corresponding to the Weyl group element induces the involutive automorphism given by :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\sigma(a,T,b)=(b,-T^t,a).} More generally the action of a M√∂bius transformation :\\\\displaystyle{g=\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\alpha & \\\\beta \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma & \\\\delta\\\\end{pmatrix}} can be described explicitly. In terms of generators diagonal matrices act as :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\alpha & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\alpha^{-1}\\\\end{pmatrix}(a,T,b)=(\\\\alpha^2 a,T,\\\\alpha^{-2}b),} upper unitriangular matrices act as :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & \\\\beta \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1\\\\end{pmatrix}(a,T,b)=(a +\\\\beta T(1) -\\\\beta^2 b,T - \\\\beta L(a),b),} and lower unitriangular matrices act as :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma & 1\\\\end{pmatrix}(a,T,b)=(a,T-\\\\gamma L(b),b-\\\\gamma T^t(1) -\\\\gamma^2 a).} This can be written uniformly in matrix notation as :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\begin{pmatrix}g(T) & g(a) \\\\\\\\\\\\ g(b) & g(T)^t\\\\end{pmatrix}= g \\\\begin{pmatrix}T & a \\\\\\\\\\\\ b & T^t\\\\end{pmatrix} g^{-1}.} In particular the grading corresponds to the action of the diagonal subgroup of , even with Œ± = 1, so a copy of T. The Killing form is given by :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathbf((a_1,T_1,b_1),(a_2,T_2,b_2))= (a_1,b_2) + (b_1,a_2) + \\\\beta(T_1,T_2),} where is the symmetric bilinear form defined by :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\beta(R(a,b),R(c,d))=(R(a,b)c,d)=(R(c,d)a,b),} with the bilinear form corresponding to the trace form: . More generally the generators of the group act by automorphisms on \\\\mathfrak{g} as *\\\\displaystyle{W(a,T,b)=(Wa,WTW^{-1},(W^t)^{-1}b),} *\\\\displaystyle{J(a,T,b)=(-b,-T^t,-a),} *\\\\displaystyle{T_x(a,T,b)=(a+Tx -Q(x)b, T-R(x,b),b),} *\\\\displaystyle{S_y(a,T,b)=(a,T-R(a,y),b-T^ty-Q(y)a).} The nondegeneracy of the Killing form is immediate from the explicit formula. By Cartan's criterion, \\\\mathfrak{g} is semisimple. In the next section the group is realized as the complexification of a connected compact Lie group with trivial center, so semisimple. This gives a direct means to verify semisimplicity. The group H also acts transitively on X. To prove that \\\\mathfrak{g} exhausts the holomorphic vector fields on , note the group T acts on holomorphic vector fields. The restriction of such a vector field to gives a holomorphic map of A into A. The power series expansion around 0 is a convergent sum of homogeneous parts of degree . The action of scales the part of degree by . By taking Fourier coefficients with respect to T, the part of degree m is also a holomorphic vector field. Since conjugation by gives the inverse on , it follows that the only possible degrees are 0, 1 and 2. Degree 0 is accounted for by the constant fields. Since conjugation by interchanges degree 0 and degree 2, it follows that \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\pm 1} account for all these holomorphic vector fields. Any further holomorphic vector field would have to appear in degree 1 and so would have the form for some in . Conjugation by J would give another such map N. Moreover, . But then :\\\\displaystyle{e^{tM}(0,0,b)=Je^{tN}J(0,0,b)=Je^{tN}(b,0,0)=(0,0,e^{tN}b).} Set and . Then :\\\\displaystyle{Q(U_ta)b = U_tQ(a)V_{-t}b.} It follows that lies in for all and hence that lies in \\\\mathfrak{g}_0. So \\\\mathfrak{g} is exactly the space of holomorphic vector fields on X. Compact real form Suppose acts trivially on \\\\mathfrak{g}. Then must leave the subalgebra invariant. Hence so must . This forces , so that . But then must leave the subalgebra invariant, so that and . If acts trivially, . The group can thus be identified with its image in GL \\\\mathfrak{g}. Let be the complexification of a Euclidean Jordan algebra . For , set . The trace form on defines a complex inner product on and hence an adjoint operation. The unitary structure group consists of those in that are in , i.e. satisfy . It is a closed subgroup of U(A). Its Lie algebra consists of the skew-adjoint elements in \\\\mathfrak{g}_0. Define a conjugate linear involution on \\\\mathfrak{g} by :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\theta(a,T,b)=(b^*,-T^*, a^*).} This is a period 2 conjugate- linear automorphism of the Lie algebra. It induces an automorphism of , which on the generators is given by :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\theta(S_a)=T_{a^*},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\theta(j)=j,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\theta(T_b)=S_{b^*},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\theta(W)=(W^*)^{-1}.} Let be the fixed point subgroup of in . Let \\\\mathfrak{h} be the fixed point subalgebra of in \\\\mathfrak{g}. Define a sesquilinear form on \\\\mathfrak{g} by . This defines a complex inner product on \\\\mathfrak{g} which restricts to a real inner product on \\\\mathfrak{h}. Both are preserved by . Let be the identity component of . It lies in . Let be the diagonal torus associated with a Jordan frame in E. The action of is compatible with which sends a unimodular matrix \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\alpha & \\\\beta\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma & \\\\delta\\\\end{pmatrix} to \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\overline{\\\\delta} & -\\\\overline{\\\\gamma}\\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\overline{\\\\beta} & \\\\overline{\\\\alpha}\\\\end{pmatrix}. In particular this gives a homomorphism of into . Now every matrix in can be written as a product :\\\\displaystyle{M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\zeta_1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\zeta_1^{-1}\\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos \\\\varphi & \\\\sin \\\\varphi\\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\sin \\\\varphi & \\\\cos \\\\varphi\\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\zeta_2 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\zeta_2^{-1}\\\\end{pmatrix}.} The factor in the middle gives another maximal torus in obtained by conjugating by . If with Œ±i = 1, then gives the action of the diagonal torus and corresponds to an element of . The element lies in and its image is a M√∂bius transformation lying in . Thus is another torus in and coincides with the image of . Since for the compact complex manifold corresponding to , if follows that , where is the image of . On the other hand, , so that . On the other hand, the stabilizer of in is , since the fixed point subgroup of under is . Hence . In particular H is compact and connected since both K and S are. Because it is a closed subgroup of U \\\\mathfrak{g}, it is a Lie group. It contains K and hence its Lie algebra contains the operators with . It contains the image of and hence the elements with in . Since and , it follows that the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{h}_1 of contains for all in . Thus it contains \\\\mathfrak{h}. They are equal because all skew-adjoint derivations of \\\\mathfrak{h} are inner. In fact, since normalizes \\\\mathfrak{h} and the action by conjugation is faithful, the map of \\\\mathfrak{h}_1 into the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{d} of derivations of \\\\mathfrak{h} is faithful. In particular \\\\mathfrak{h} has trivial center. To show that \\\\mathfrak{h} equals \\\\mathfrak{h}_1, it suffices to show that \\\\mathfrak{d} coincides with \\\\mathfrak{h}. Derivations on \\\\mathfrak{h} are skew-adjoint for the inner product given by minus the Killing form. Take the invariant inner product on \\\\mathfrak{d} given by . Since \\\\mathfrak{h} is invariant under \\\\mathfrak{d} so is its orthogonal complement. They are both ideals in \\\\mathfrak{d}, so the Lie bracket between them must vanjsh. But then any derivation in the orthogonal complement would have 0 Lie bracket with \\\\mathfrak{h}, so must be zero. Hence \\\\mathfrak{h} is the Lie algebra of . (This also follows from a dimension count since .) The formulas above for the action of and show that the image of is closed in GL \\\\mathfrak{g}. Since acts transitively on and the stabilizer of in is , it follows that . The compactness of and closedness of implies that is closed in GL \\\\mathfrak{g}. is a closed subgroup of GL \\\\mathfrak{g} so a real Lie group. Since it contains with or , its Lie algebra contains \\\\mathfrak{g}. Since \\\\mathfrak{g} is the complexification of \\\\mathfrak{h}, like \\\\mathfrak{h} all its derivations are inner and it has trivial center. Since the Lie algebra of normalizes \\\\mathfrak{g} and o is the only element centralizing \\\\mathfrak{g}, as in the compact case the Lie algebra of must be \\\\mathfrak{g}. (This can also be seen by a dimension count since .) Since it is a complex subspace, is a complex Lie group. It is connected because it is the continuous image of the connected set . Since \\\\mathfrak{g} is the complexification of \\\\mathfrak{h}, is the complexification of . Noncompact real form For in the spectral norm a is defined to be if with and in . It is independent of choices and defines a norm on . Let be the set of with a < 1 and let be the identity component of the closed subgroup of G carrying onto itself. It is generated by , the M√∂bius transformations in and the image of corresponding to a Jordan frame. Let œÑ be the conjugate-linear period 2 automorphism of \\\\mathfrak{g} defined by :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\tau(a,T,b)=(-a^*,-T^*,-b^*).} Let \\\\mathfrak{h}^* be the fixed point algebra of œÑ. It is the Lie algebra of . It induces a period 2 automorphism of with fixed point subgroup . The group acts transitively on . The stabilizer of 0 is .See:  The noncompact real semisimple Lie group acts on X with an open orbit . As with the action of on the Riemann sphere, it has only finitely many orbits. This orbit structure can be explicitly described when the Jordan algebra is simple. Let be the subset of consisting of elements with exactly of the Œ±i less than one and exactly of them greater than one. Thus . These sets are the intersections of the orbits of with . The orbits with are open. There is a unique compact orbit . It is the Shilov boundary S of D consisting of elements with in , the underlying Euclidean Jordan algebra. is in the closure of if and only if and . In particular is in the closure of every orbit.See:  Jordan algebras with involution The preceding theory describes irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type in terms of unital Jordan algebras. In general Hermitian symmetric spaces are described by a systematic extension of the above theory to Jordan pairs. In the development of , however, irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces not of tube type are described in terms of period two automorphisms of simple Euclidean Jordan algebras. In fact any period 2 automorphism defines a Jordan pair: the general results of on Jordan pairs can be specialized to that setting. Let œÑ be a period two automorphism of a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra E with complexification A. There are corresponding decompositions E = E+ ‚äï E‚àí and A = A+ ‚äï A‚àí into ¬±1 eigenspaces of œÑ. Let . œÑ is assumed to satisfy the additional condition that the trace form on defines an inner product. For in , define to be the restriction of to V. For a pair in , define and to be the restriction of and to . Then is simple if and only if the only subspaces invariant under all the operators and are and . The conditions for quasi-invertibility in show that is invertible if and only if is invertible. The quasi-inverse is the same whether computed in or . A space of equivalence classes can be defined on pairs . It is a closed subspace of , so compact. It also has the structure of a complex manifold, modelled on . The structure group can be defined in terms of and it has as a subgroup the unitary structure group with identity component . The group is the identity component of the fixed point subgroup of œÑ in . Let be the group of biholomorphisms of generated by in , the identity component of , and the Abelian groups consisting of the and consisting of the with and in . It acts transitively on with stabilizer and . The Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}_\\\\tau of holomorphic vector fields on is a 3-graded Lie algebra, :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{g}_\\\\tau = \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\tau,+1} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\tau,0} \\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{g}_{\\\\tau,-1}.} Restricted to the components are generated as before by the constant functions into , by the operators and by the operators . The Lie brackets are given by exactly the same formula as before. The spectral decomposition in and is accomplished using tripotents, i.e. elements such that . In this case is an idempotent in . There is a Pierce decomposition into eigenspaces of . The operators and commute, so leaves the eigenspaces above invariant. In fact acts as 0 on , as 1/4 on and 1 on . This induces a Pierce decomposition . The subspace becomes a Euclidean Jordan algebra with unit under the mutation Jordan product }. Two tripotents and are said to be orthogonal if all the operators when a and b are powers of and and if the corresponding idempotents and are orthogonal. In this case and generate a commutative associative algebra and , since . Let be in . Let be the finite- dimensional real subspace spanned by odd powers of . The commuting self- adjoint operators with odd powers of act on , so can be simultaneously diagonalized by an orthonormal basis . Since is a positive multiple of , rescaling if necessary, can be chosen to be a tripotent. They form an orthogonal family by construction. Since is in , it can be written with real. These are called the eigenvalues of (with respect to œÑ). Any other tripotent in has the form with , so the are up to sign the minimal tripotents in . A maximal family of orthogonal tripotents in is called a Jordan frame. The tripotents are necessarily minimal. All Jordan frames have the same number of elements, called the rank of . Any two frames are related by an element in the subgroup of the structure group of preserving the trace form. For a given Jordan frame , any element in can be written in the form with and an operator in . The spectral norm of is defined by a = sup Œ±i and is independent of choices. Its square equals the operator norm of . Thus becomes a complex normed space with open unit ball . Note that for in , the operator is self- adjoint so that the norm  = n. Since , it follows that  = n. In particular the spectral norm of in is the square root of the spectral norm of . It follows that the spectral norm of is the same whether calculated in or . Since preserves both norms, the spectral norm on is obtained by restricting the spectral norm on . For a Jordan frame , let . There is an action of on which extends to V. If and , then and give the action of the product of the lower and upper unitriangular matrices. If with , then the corresponding product of diagonal matrices act as , where . In particular the diagonal matrices give an action of and . As in the case without an automorphism œÑ, there is an automorphism Œ∏ of . The same arguments show that the fixed point subgroup is generated by and the image of . It is a compact connected Lie group. It acts transitively on ; the stabilizer of is . Thus , a Hermitian symmetric space of compact type. Let be the identity component of the closed subgroup of carrying onto itself. It is generated by and the image of corresponding to a Jordan frame. Let œÅ be the conjugate-linear period 2 automorphism of \\\\mathfrak{g}_\\\\tau defined by :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\rho(a,T,b)=(-a^*,-T^*,-b^*).} Let \\\\mathfrak{h}^*_\\\\tau be the fixed point algebra of œÅ. It is the Lie algebra of . It induces a period 2 automorphism of with fixed point subgroup . The group acts transitively on . The stabilizer of 0 is .See: * * is the Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type dual to . The Hermitian symmetric space of non-compact type have an unbounded realization, analogous the upper half-plane in C. M√∂bius transformations in corresponding to the Cayley transform and its inverse give biholomorphisms of the Riemann sphere exchanging the unit disk and the upper halfplane. When the Hermitian symmetric space is of tube type the same M√∂bius transformations map the disk in onto the tube domain were is the open self- dual convex cone of squares in the Euclidean Jordan algebra . For Hermitian symmetric space not of tube type there is no action of on X, so no analogous Cayley transform. A partial Cayley transform can be defined in that case for any given maximal tripotent in . It takes the disk in onto a Siegel domain of the second kind. In this case is a Euclidean Jordan algebra and there is symmetric -valued bilinear form on such that the corresponding quadratic form takes values in its positive cone . The Siegel domain consists of pairs such that lies in . The quadratic form on and the squaring operation on are given by . The positive cone corresponds to with invertible. Examples For simple Euclidean Jordan algebras with complexication , the Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type can be described explicitly as follows, using Cartan's classification. Type In. A is the Jordan algebra of n √ó n complex matrices with the operator Jordan product . It is the complexification of , the Euclidean Jordan algebra of self-adjoint n √ó n complex matrices. In this case acting on with g=\\\\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & d\\\\end{pmatrix} acting as . Indeed, this can be verified directly for diagonal, upper and lower unitriangular matrices which correspond to the operators , and . The subset corresponds to the matrices with invertible.

The Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type for simple Euclidean Jordan algebras with period two automorphism can be described explicitly as follows, using Cartan's classification. Type Ip,q. Let F be the space of q by p matrices over R with p ‚â† q.

Without loss of generality can be taken greater than . The structure is given by the triple product . The space X can be identified with the Grassmannian of -dimensional subspace of . This has a natural embedding in by adding 0's in the last coordinates. Since any -dimensional subspace of can be represented in the form [], the same is true for subspaces lying in . The last rows of must vanish and the mapping does not change if the last rows of are set equal to zero. So a similar representation holds for mappings, but now with q by p matrices. Exactly as when , it follows that there is an action of by fractional linear transformations.See: * * Type IIn F is the space of real skew-symmetric m by m matrices. After removing a factor of , this corresponds to the period 2 automorphism given by complex conjugation on E = Hn(C). Type V. F is the direct sum of two copies of the Cayley numbers, regarded as 1 by 2 matrices. This corresponds to the canonical period 2 automorphism defined by any minimal idempotent in E = H3(O).

It served with 29th Division in the Gallipoli Campaign and on the Western Front. It was disbanded after the war. History Duplicate numbering Strangely, two Royal Horse Artillery brigades were formed early in World War I and simultaneously designated as XV Brigade, RHA. The first was formed on 1 October 1914 for service with the 3rd Cavalry Division and commanded C, G and K Batteries, RHA. It was renumbered as IV Brigade, RHA in May 1915. The second was formed in January 1915 and is the subject of the current article. Formation XV Brigade, RHA was formed at Leamington, Warwickshire in January 1915 with: * B Battery of I Brigade, RHA at Ambala, India * L Battery at St John's Wood Barracks, reformed after the Action at N√©ry * Y Battery of XIII Brigade, RHA at Mhow, India * XV RHA Brigade Ammunition Column On formation, the batteries were re-equipped with four 18 pounders each. The brigade was assigned to the 29th Division. In March 1915, it embarked at Avonmouth and sailed for Alexandria (via Malta) arriving from 28 March. On 7 April, the division began re-embarking at Alexandria and sailed for Gallipoli. Gallipoli The division started landing at Cape Helles from 7am on 25 April and served on the Gallipoli Peninsula until January 1915. While at Helles, the division saw action at the Capture of Sedd el Bahr (26 April), the First (28 April), Second (6‚Äì8 May) and Third Battles of Krithia (4 June), the Battle of Gully Ravine (28 June ‚Äì 2 July) and the Battle of Krithia Vineyard (6‚Äì13 August). From 16 August to the night of 19/20 December 1915, the bulk of the division served at Suvla but the brigade remained at Helles. On the night of 7/8 January 1916, the division was evacuated from Helles. The division moved to Egypt where it was concentrated at Suez. In March 1916, it was transferred to France, landing at Marseille and reaching the Somme area (near Pont-Remy) between 15 and 29 March. On 31 March, 369th Battery, RFA arrived from England and joined the brigade; it left for 132nd Brigade, RFA (29th Division) on 20 May. The brigade remained on the Western Front for the rest of the war. Western Front The first action on the Western Front was the Battle of the Somme. On 1 July 1916, the brigade took part in the Battle of Albert as part of VIII Corps, Fourth Army. On 12 September 1916, the brigade was reorganized. 132nd Brigade, RFA was broken up and its three batteries were used to make up XV Brigade, RHA and 17th Brigade, RFA to six 18 pounders each. At the same time, 460th (H) Battery, RFA (four 4.5\\" howitzers) joined the brigade from 17th Brigade, RFA. It was made up to six howitzers on 19 January 1917. The final change in organization occurred on 27 November 1916 when Y Battery was transferred to the 1st Cavalry Division and 1/1st Warwickshire Battery, RHA (TF) was received in exchange. In 1917, the brigade supported the division in a large number of major actions including the Battle of Arras (April to May, First, Second and Third Battles of the Scarpe), the Third Battle of Ypres (August to October, battles of Langemarck, Brodseinde and Poelcappelle) and the Battle of Cambrai (November and December, including the Tank Attack and the German Counter-attacks). 1918 likewise saw a number of major actions, including the Battle of the Lys (April, the battles of Estaires, Messines, Hazelbrouck and Bailleul), the Advance to Victory (August and September) and the Final Advance in Flanders (September and October, Fifth Battle of Ypres and Battle of Courtrai). At the Armistice, it was still serving with 29th Division with B Battery RHA, L Battery RHA, 1/1st Warwickshire Battery RHA (TF) and 460th (H) Battery RFA (eighteen 18 pounders and six 4.5\\" howitzers). Dissolved Still with 29th Division, the brigade advanced into Germany to take part in the Occupation of the Rhineland. It left 29th Division in December 1918 and returned to England from Germany in April 1919. The brigade was disbanded at this time. 460th (H) Battery was disbanded, 1/1st Warwickshire Battery, RHA (TF) was disembodied, B Battery joined I Brigade, RHA and L Battery joined VII Brigade, RHA, both in the United Kingdom.

He organized the first exhibition on Gio Ponti in the United States, researches and advises on academic essays, and has worked with Sotheby's and Phillips de Pury. He is specifically a historian on Milanese designers Luigi Caccia Dominioni, Ignazio Gardella, Ico & Luisa Parisi, Gi√≤ Ponti, Carlo Mollino, Carlo Scarpa, and Giuseppe Terragni. He is a member of the Gio Ponti Archive and collaborator with the Triennale di Milano. Early life The son of an American Diplomat, Brian Kish grew up during the '60s in Manhattan, New York until age 14, when his family relocated to London, England. He spent his formative years there attending the American School in London and then the venerable Courtauld Institute of Art. While still a teenager, he began working at DM Gallery which focused on \\"all the latest from Milan\\". Involved in London's art world and New wave music scene in the '80s, Kish was friends with Christian Louboutin, Norman Rosenthal, Derek Jarman, F.P. Boue, and Robert Beavers. Kish dealt privately in contemporary art in New York and London for two decades, before designing and opening his eponymous gallery in 1991 in SoHo, New York focusing on post-war Italian Design. Italian Rationalist Design In 2001, he curated the first U.S. exhibition on Gi√≤ Ponti titled \\"Gio Ponti: A Metaphysical World\\" at the Queens Museum of Art. In 1997 and for the next 16 years, Kish worked on sourcing, importing and popularizing Italian Rationalist design to the U.S. in a marketplace dominated by midcentury Scandinavian, French and American furniture with much greater distribution. Many limits to the supply of Italian Rationalist pieces drove the prices up in the '90s and throughout the 2000s. Kish stated in an October 2000 interview that access to Italian design remained limited to a few auction houses and estate sales as Italians still lived with their mid-century design and were not selling. Supply was further limited by U.S. and Italian import regulations. In 2013, Italian design is having its momento and its sales now drive the bottom line of New York auction houses.

It has repeatedly been contested between European and North African powers and has endured fourteen sieges since it was first settled in the 11th century. The peninsula's occupants ‚Äì Moors, Spanish, and British ‚Äì have built successive layers of fortifications and defences including walls, bastions, casemates, gun batteries, magazines, tunnels and galleries. At their peak in 1865, the fortifications housed around 681 guns mounted in 110 batteries and positions, guarding all land and sea approaches to Gibraltar.Hughes & Migos, p. 91 The fortifications continued to be in military use until as late as the 1970s and by the time tunnelling ceased in the late 1960s, over of galleries had been dug in an area of only . Gibraltar's fortifications are clustered in three main areas. The densest fortifications are in the area where historically Gibraltar was under the most threat ‚Äì at the north end of the peninsula, the North Front, facing the isthmus with Spain. Another group of fortifications guards the town and the harbour, referred to as the West Side. The southern end of the town is guarded by the South Land Front. Few fortifications exist on the east side, as the sheer cliff of the Rock of Gibraltar is a virtually impassable obstacle. Further fortifications occupy the plateaus of Windmill Hill and Europa Point at the southern end of the peninsula. Lookout posts and batteries on the summits of the Rock provide a 360¬∞ view across the Strait and far into Spain. Although Gibraltar is now largely demilitarised, many of the fortifications are still intact and some, such as the Great Siege Tunnels and the Charles V Wall ‚Äì where many of Gibraltar's famous \\"apes\\" live ‚Äì have become tourist attractions. Topography An aerial view of modern Gibraltar, looking north- west The nature and position of Gibraltar's defences have been dictated by the territory's topography. It is a long, narrow peninsula measuring by wide at maximum, with a land area of about . The only land access to the peninsula is via a sandy isthmus, only above sea level, most of which is now occupied by the Spanish town of La L√≠nea de la Concepci√≥n. The peninsula is dominated by the limestone massif of the Rock of Gibraltar, which presents a sheer cliff over high at its north end, facing the isthmus. The Rock extends southwards for with several peaks before it descends to two southern plateaus at heights of between and above sea level. The southern tip of Gibraltar is surrounded by steep cliffs. The Rock itself is asymmetric, with a moderate slope on the west side and a very steep (and in places near-vertical) slope on the east side. The original core of the town of Gibraltar occupies the lower north-west side of the Rock, adjoining the Bay of Gibraltar, though it has grown considerably to the point that the built-up area now stretches all the way to Europa Point on the southern tip of the peninsula. A great deal of 20th century land reclamation on the west side has also widened the coastal area, which was formerly quite narrow. A couple of small settlements, originally fishing villages, occupy the east side.Rose (2001), p. 95 These features have made Gibraltar a naturally strong defensive position. The isthmus lacks any natural cover, exposing any approaching enemy to opposing fire. The heights of the Rock form a natural barrier to movement and rocky ledges provide natural platforms for gun batteries. The sheer cliffs on the north and east sides of the Rock block access from those directions and the sea cliffs around the southern end of the peninsula make landings there difficult, especially if opposed.Fa and Finlayson, pp. 4‚Äì5 A single road connects Gibraltar with Spain, and within the territory most roads are narrow and often steep due to the restricted land area.Rose (1998), p. 92 Over the centuries, Gibraltar's successive occupants have built an increasingly complex set of fortifications around, on top of and incorporating the territory's natural features. Writing in 1610, the Spanish historian Fernando del Portillo commented that Gibraltar was \\"a stronghold from its very topography which with a little art could be made impregnable,\\" and so it has proved. The Irish writer George Newenham Wright observed in 1840 that \\"the surface of the Rock is wholly occupied by defensive works; where it was possible, and often where it appeared almost impracticable, batteries and fortifications have been formed. From Europa Point, which pushes into the sea on the south side, to the highest point of the Rock, there is not a single point that has not been put into a defensible condition . . . Proceeding towards Europa Point, at the entrance of the town, fortifications, magazines, barracks, and batteries are placed wherever the nature of the surface would permit.\\"Wright, p. 25 History Moorish period Gibraltar's fortifications have evolved in a number of stages. Its first permanent inhabitants, the Moors of North Africa, are said to have established a fort on Djebel Tarik (the Mount of Tarik, a name that was eventually corrupted into Gibraltar) \\"to be on guard and watch events on the other side of the Straits\\" as early as 1068.Jackson, pp. 31‚Äì32 Gibraltar was fortified for the first time in 1160 by the Almohad Sultan Abd al-Mu'min in response to the coastal threat posed by the Christian kings of Aragon and Castile. The Rock of Gibraltar was renamed Jebel al-Fath (the Mount of Victory), though this name did not persist,Hills, p. 13 and a fortified town named Medinat al-Fath (the City of Victory) was laid out on the upper slopes of the Rock.Fa and Finlayson, p. 11 It is unclear how much of Medinat al-Fath was actually built, as the surviving archaeological remains of Moorish Gibraltar are scanty.Jackson, pp. 34‚Äì35 A portion of wall some long still survives to the south of the main part of the city of Gibraltar, of similar design to defensive walls in Morocco. It may have protected a settlement on the upper part of the Rock, around where the modern Queen's Road is, but firm archaeological evidence is lacking.Hills, p. 39 The city fell to the Castilians in 1309 after the first siege of Gibraltar and its fortifications were repaired and improved by King Ferdinand IV of Castile, who ordered the construction of a keep above the town.Hills, p. 49 The Castilians maintained control of Gibraltar until 1333, resisting a Moorish siege in 1315, but relinquished it in 1333 after the third siege of Gibraltar. After defeating a Castilian counter-siege which ended after two months, the Marinid sultan Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman ordered a refortification of Gibraltar \\"with strong walls as a halo surrounds the crescent moon\\".Fa and Finlayson, p. 9 Many details of the rebuilt city are known due to the work of Abu al-Hasan's biographer, Ibn Marzuq, whose Musnad (written around 1370‚Äì71) describes the reconstruction of Gibraltar. The city was expanded, and a new defensive wall was built to cover the western and southern flanks, with towers and connecting passages added to strengthen them. The existing fortifications were also strengthened and repaired. The weak points that the Castilians had exploited were improved. Part of the Moorish city wall with a tower en bec, topped with merlons Map of the Moorish Castle: The refortified city occupied the north- eastern part of the present-day city, reaching from the area of Grand Casemates Square up to Upper Castle Road. It was divided into three main quarters which functioned as a series of baileys through which troops could fall back in stages. The Tower of Homage (now usually called the Moorish Castle, though more properly that name refers to the entire fortified area of the Moorish city) was located at the highest point, serving as a final redoubt. The Tower was a formidable square keep situated within a kasbah and had the largest footprint of all the towers to be built in Moorish Al-Andalus ().Fa and Finlayson, p. 12 It was a much-strengthened rebuilding of an earlier tower and still bears scars on its eastern wall from projectiles shot by the Castilians during the siege of 1333. The kasbah could only be accessed via a single gate, which still survives; an inscription visible up to the 18th century recorded that it had been dedicated to Yusuf I, Sultan of Granada.Fa and Finlayson, p. 16 Below the kasbah was an area later called the Villa Vieja (Old Town) by the Spanish, accessed via the Bab el-Granada (Granada Gate), and below that was a port area called La Barcina by the Spanish, which may have taken its name from the Galley House () built there by the Moors.\\"The Islamic City and Fortifications\\". Moorish Castle, Gibraltar It had three separate access gates: the Land Gate (now the Landport Gate), the Sea Gate (now the Grand Casemates Gates) and a southern gate, the Barcina Gate. The core of the city was surrounded by substantial defensive walls with tall towers topped by merlons.Fa and Finlayson, p. 14 Other than the Tower of Homage, two such towers still survive; one square based which was fitted with a clock in Victorian times (now the Stanley Clock Tower)Fa and Finlayson, p. 56 and another constructed en bec (beaked, a design intended to resist mining).Fa and Finlayson, p. 13 The walls were at first built using tapia, a lime-based mortar made with the local sand and faced with decorative brickwork to simulate masonry. The builders later changed their construction methods to utilise stone interlaced with brick, a rather stronger structure. The southern flank of the walls has survived relatively intact, and vestiges of the other walls are most likely still to be found underlying the modern defensive walls constructed by the British. To the south of the fortified city was an urban area known as the Turba al Hamra, literally the \\"red sands\\", named after the predominant colouration of the soil in that area. Ibn Battuta visited the city in 1353‚Äì54 and wrote: Spanish period The Charles V Wall, built in 1540 and strengthened in 1552 by King Charles I of Spain (Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire) Castile regained control of Gibraltar in the Eighth Siege of 1462.Jackson, p. 57 The Moorish threat receded following the completion of the Reconquista and the fortifications were allowed to fall into decay, with very few cannon mounted on the batteries.Jackson, p. 73 In 1535, the Spanish naval commander √Ålvaro de Baz√°n the Elder warned King Charles I that Gibraltar's defences were seriously inadequate and recommended that the Line Wall Curtain be extended all the way to Europa Point on the southern tip of Gibraltar and that the town's southern wall should be strengthened. However, his advice was ignored.Fa and Finlayson, p. 17 The soldier and writer Pedro Barrantes Maldonaldo noted that by 1540 Gibraltar's north-west bastion (presumably referring to North Bastion) had only four guns, while the castle's few guns were all dismounted (and therefore unusable), and there were no gunners. The garrison's equipment was antiquated and their numbers were few. The town's walls were still essentially medieval and could not have resisted mid-16th century artillery. The fall of Constantinople 90 years earlier showed just how vulnerable such walls could be in the face of a heavy artillery bombardment.Hills, p. 106 The town's inhabitants paid the price for this neglect in September 1540 when Barbary pirates from North Africa carried out a major raid, taking advantage of the weak defenses. Hundreds of Gibraltar's residents were taken as hostages or slaves. The Spanish crown responded to Gibraltar's vulnerability by building the Charles V Wall to control the southern flank of the Rock. The wall's builder, the Italian engineer Giovanni Battista Calvi, also strengthened the Landport Gate. Another Italian engineer, Giovan Giacomo Paleari Fratino, extended the wall onto the Upper Rock at some point probably between 1558‚Äì65.Hughes & Migos, p. 31 A lookout tower, one of several constructed along Spain's southern coast during this period, was built at the eastern end of the isthmus linking Gibraltar with the Spanish mainland. This structure, known as Devil's Tower, was demolished during World War II.Jackson, p. 75 The German engineer Daniel Specklin is also thought to have been employed in improving Gibraltar's fortifications between 1550‚Äì52. Although there is no direct evidence, the Spanish fortifications at the southern end of the town are virtually identical in design to drawings in Specklin's posthumously published Architectura von Vestungen (\\"The Architecture of Fortresses\\") and on this basis it has been suggested that he was the designer of Gibraltar's southern works. Although the 16th century works improved Gibraltar's defences significantly, they still had major shortcomings. Fernandez del Portillo noted in 1610 that while Gibraltar was \\"girt by quite a good wall with bastions at corners\\", there still remained work to be done to complete the fortification plans that had been drawn up in the previous century. He felt that \\"perhaps what does exist is enough to withstand an assault and more.\\"Hills, p. 121 The biggest weakness was the lack of an effective sea wall to resist naval bombardments, and in 1618 Philip III of Spain authorised works to create a new mole for a deep-water harbour, protected by a newly constructed gun platform and the Torre del Tuerto fort.Hills, p. 124 Philip IV subsequently ordered a major modernisation of Gibraltar's fortifications due to hostile activity in the Strait by the Protestant powers of northern Europe ‚Äì particularly England and the Dutch Republic. On visiting Gibraltar in 1624, the king found that his carriage could not fit through the Landport Gate. He had to walk into the town instead and expressed his displeasure, to which Gibraltar's military governor is said to have retorted: \\"Sir, the Gate was not made for the passage of carriages, but for the exclusion of enemies.\\"Jackson, p. 82 The northern approach to Gibraltar as seen in 1567; in the 17th century the tall towers for archers were pulled down and replaced with bastions for cannon The fortifications had only relatively thin crenelated walls, which were insufficiently strong to counter artillery bombardments. They were lined with many tall towers for archers, but could not be used to mount cannon. Don Luis Bravo de Acu√±a, the governor of Gibraltar, produced a report for the king recommending a series of changes to the territory's fortifications. A series of new batteries was built along the Line Wall, each named after saints, and a New Mole (later renamed the South Mole) was built to provide additional protection to ships in the harbour.Jackson, p. 84 On the north side of Gibraltar, the Muralla de San Bernando (now the Grand Battery) was fully adapted to mount cannon facing the isthmus with the old archery towers being pulled down and replaced by bastions. The Old Mole, stretching into the Bay of Gibraltar, provided further mountings for cannon to sweep the isthmus. A series of defensive works constructed on a glacis above the entrance to the town provided further enfilading fire. A formidable bastion was constructed to protect the south of the town; known as the Baluarte de Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario (\\"Bastion of Our Lady of the Rosary\\"), and now as the South Bastion, it enfiladed the ditch across the Gate of Africa, now the Southport Gates.Fa and Finlayson, p. 20 However, the effectiveness of the new fortifications was undermined by the continued failure of the Spanish crown to provide enough troops to man them.Jackson, p. 84 In August 1704, an Anglo-Dutch invasion force sailed into the Bay of Gibraltar and rapidly overcame the poorly manned garrison. Don Diego de Salinas, the last Spanish governor of Gibraltar, had repeatedly called for the garrison and fortifications to be strengthened, but to no avail. When Admiral George Rooke's fleet carried out the capture of Gibraltar, his 350 guns were opposed by only 80 iron and 32 brass cannon of various calibres in Gibraltar. Most of the Spanish guns were not even manned. De Salinas only had about 150 regular soldiers, very few of whom were gunners, and about 250 armed civilians.Jackson, p. 96 Gibraltar fell after only four days of fighting.Jackson, p. 99 A Franco-Spanish army laid siege shortly afterwards and was able to inflict substantial damage on the old Spanish fortifications, which crumbled under the constant pounding.Jackson, p. 108-9 However, the Anglo-Dutch garrison was able to repair the worst of the damage and repelled Franco-Spanish attacks while being resupplied and reinforced by sea. After eight months the French and Spanish abandoned the twelfth siege of Gibraltar.Jackson, p. 110-11 British period =Eighteenth century= The most substantial development of Gibraltar's fortifications took place during the British occupation of the territory from 1704 to the present day. Little was done initially to improve the fortifications, beyond making modest upgrades and repairing the damage caused by the 1704 siege.Fa and Finlayson, p. 25 In 1709, General James Stanhope complained to the Earl of Galway that \\"the [defence] works in general are in a very bad condition, and the money they have cost I am afraid has been ill laid out\\", by which he meant that it had been misappropriated.Hills, p. 216 Rather than being spent on the fortifications, the funds had been diverted by corrupt officers to repair their own houses in the town. Other officers were accused of stealing cannons and selling them for profit in Lisbon.Hughes & Migos, p. 36 Stanhope expressed concern that the prospect of losing Gibraltar was \\"very practicable\\" given the poor condition of the defences. Another siege was mounted in 1727 but the Spanish failed to retake Gibraltar, as the British were once again able to reinforce and resupply the garrison by sea. Following the siege, the Spanish began the construction in 1730 of the Lines of Contravallation, a fortified structure across the entire width of the isthmus anchored by two major forts on each end.Hughes & Migos, p. 364 This was intended to block access from Gibraltar to the Spanish mainland, and also to serve as a base for any future sieges. The territory's importance increased following Britain's defeat in the Battle of Minorca in 1756, when a French naval victory led to the surrender of the British garrison there.Jackson, p. 144 The first tranche of serious improvements made by the British after the siege focused on the North Front, where the weight of any future attack was likely to be heaviest. A marshy area in front of the Landport Gate was flooded and turned into what became known as \\"the Inundation\\", a pear-shaped body of brackish water blocked with palisades, underwater ditches and other hidden obstacles to prevent passage. This left only two narrow approaches to the town, each guarded by barriers and watched over by cannon loaded with lethal grapeshot. The Devil's Tongue Battery was constructed on the Old Mole to provide enfilading fire across the isthmus. The northern defences around the Grand Battery and the Landport were also strengthened. Further improvements were made under Lord Tyrawley during his term as governor, but progress was hindered by his confrontational relationship with his senior engineer, William Skinner. Gibraltar's defences were stronger than they had been in the earlier siege but still had many deficiencies.Hughes & Migos, p. 40 The fortress seemed at first sight to be well-armed, with 339 cannon in 1744, but this number concealed the fact that they consisted of at least eight different calibres, some made of brass and some of iron ‚Äì which meant greatly differing levels of reliability ‚Äì and they required many different types of spares and ammunition, adding to the garrison's logistical problems.Hughes & Migos, p. 38 Skinner and Tyrawley agreed that the most pressing threat was that of a combined land and sea assault focusing on the weakest part of the defences, the open ground between the South Front of the town and Europa Point at the end of the peninsula. However, they disagreed vehemently over where and how to construct the defences. Tyrawley put a great deal of energy into constructing new earthworks, batteries and a series of retrenched lines between the South Bastion and the New Mole, called the Prince of Wales Lines. It was said of him that he would never let a day pass \\"without visiting the works once or twice during his stay where there was a possibility of going out.\\"Hughes & Migos, p. 42 Skinner disagreed with the placement of the new fortifications and criticised the use of compacted earth and sun-baked bricks, which had enabled them to be built at great speed and minimum cost, rather than stone. Skinner perhaps had a point, as most of Tyrawley's works were washed away by rain within only a few years.Hughes & Migos, p. 41 More fundamental and lasting changes were made under Colonel William Green, who was posted to Gibraltar as its senior engineer in 1761. A veteran soldier with experience of campaigns in the Netherlands and Canada, he arrived in Gibraltar with a wealth of knowledge of the latest methods of fortification.Jackson, p. 147 He was strongly supported by Tyrawley's successor as governor, Lieutenant General Edward Cornwallis, who wrote in 1768: King's Bastion, built between 1773‚Äì76. The armoured iron casemate was added in the 1860s. Funds were scarce in the 1760s but a number of improvements were made to the North Front defences and the sea wall from South Bastion to Europa Point, which was severely damaged by a great storm in 1766. Green spent several years reviewing the state of the fortifications and developing a plan to improve them. He sent a report to the Board of Ordnance in London in 1762 and another in 1768.Hughes & Migos, p. 43 The following year he travelled to London to present his conclusions to a commission appointed by William Pitt the Elder. He summed up his three principal aims as being to prevent a possible landing by sea; to improve the quality of the garrison and its provisioning; and to keep the enemy at a distance with artillery.Hughes & Migos, p. 48 After a lengthy debate the government approved his plans and Green returned to Gibraltar to implement them. The territory's fortifications were still largely based around the old Spanish and Moorish defences, though these had been strengthened and supplemented over the years. The sea wall was still much as it had been in the Spanish period and still represented a weak point, and a lack of accommodation for the 4,000 officers and men of the garrison was also a major problem. Green set about thoroughly overhauling, redesigning and re-siting the fortifications, building new bastions, redans, storehouses, hospitals, magazines and bomb-proof barracks and casemates. Among his most important improvements was the construction of the King's Bastion, a fortification projecting from the sea wall between the Old and New Moles. It mounted twelve 32-pounder guns and ten 8-inch howitzers on its front, with another ten guns and howitzers on its flanks, allowing heavy fire to be directed out into the bay and enfilading the sea wall in both directions. Its massive structure, with solid stone parapets up to thick, could house 800 men in its casemates.Hughes & Migos, p. 280 To carry out the improvements more efficiently and cheaply, Green raised a Soldier Artificer Company ‚Äì a predecessor of the Royal Engineers ‚Äì of skilled labourers under military discipline. He also improved the garrison's state of preparation for a fresh siege. The quality of the guns was improved; by 1776 there were 98 pointing north plus two mortars and two howitzers. Another 300 were mounted on the Line Wall and the south front, and there was room for a further 106. The guns were kept constantly loaded with several rounds positioned nearby in reserve, in case of a surprise attack.Hills, p. 309 The Spanish historian L√≥pez de Ayala remarked on how well prepared the garrison was: Reconstruction of British gunners firing from an embrasure in the Great Siege Tunnels of Gibraltar Green's improvements came just in time to meet the challenge of the Great Siege of Gibraltar between 1779‚Äì83. Despite the siege, the defences were continually improved under Green's supervision. More batteries and bastions were constructed on the North Front, all the way up to the summit of the Rock.Fa and Finlayson, p. 29 The first of Gibraltar's many tunnels was also constructed, with the original intention of reaching a rocky outcrop called the Notch on the north face of the Rock, to cover a blind angle on the Mediterranean side. As the tunnel was being constructed, an air vent was excavated using explosives. The tunnellers realised that they could use the shaft as an embrasure for a gun. They turned the tunnel into the first of a series of galleries with embrasures at intervals, overlooking the isthmus, which could be used to bombard the enemy lines with impunity.Hughes & Migos, p. 59 The tunnelling continued after the siege and by 1790 over of tunnels had been excavated, providing bombproof communications routes between the various lines and batteries on the North Front of the Rock. The Notch was also reached and was hollowed out to become a large gallery, called St George's Hall, capable of accommodating five guns.Hughes & Migos, p. 72‚Äì3 Further works were carried out to repair, rebuild and improve the defences around the Waterport Front, which incorporated the old Waterport Gate. New casemates, counterguards, tenailles and lunettes were built in the area and the Montagu and Orange Bastions were enlarged. The work was carried out amidst considerable controversy, as there were vigorous disagreements between the governors and senior engineers of the time over how the works should be carried out and indeed whether some of them should be pursued at all.Hughes & Migos, pp. 76‚Äì82 =Nineteenth century= View of Gibraltar from the New Mole fort looking north, 1828 Gibraltar remained at peace for 121 years after the Great Siege ‚Äì one of the longest periods of peace in its history ‚Äì but work continued to develop the fortifications, driven to a large extent by the increasingly rapid pace of change in the power and range of artillery. The Grand Casemates, a huge bombproof barracks, was built in 1817.Fa and Finlayson, p. 31 Proposals were put forward in 1826 to rebuild the Line Wall with new bastions, though they were never put into practice. In 1841, General Sir John Thomas Jones of the Royal Engineers conducted a study of Gibraltar's defences which prompted major changes and defined the nature of the fortifications for many years to come.Hughes & Migos, pp. 88‚Äì89 Jones's recommendations were based on a number of key assumptions about the threats faced in particular sectors of the fortifications. First, the North Front was so strongly defended that it was very unlikely to be vulnerable. Second, the sea defences below the South Bastion could be breached but an invader would still face the barrier of the South Front. Third, the Europa defences might also be breached, but a defender holding the narrow Europa Pass or the heights of Windmill Hill could easily enfilade an invader; as Jones put it, \\"two hundred men on Windmill Hill and Europa Pass ought to hold as many thousands at bay\\". Fourth, the main threat was ‚Äì as Green had recognised 80 years earlier ‚Äì to the town itself. An enemy breaching the sea wall in the town would bypass the two land fronts and be able to attack them from their highly vulnerable rear.Hughes & Migos, pp. 89‚Äì90 Jones also recognised that the development of more powerful and accurate artillery made the old system of shoreline batteries extremely vulnerable. He proposed that the shoreline artillery should be pulled back some to \\"retired batteries\\" situated higher up the hill, equipped with the latest and most powerful guns and firing from barbettes rather than through embrasures. Such positions could not easily be seen from the sea, were out of the effective range of enemy ships and could not be flanked by landward guns. The sea wall would be defended solely by musket fire with the artillery support being provided from the bastions and retired batteries.Hughes & Migos, p. 90 Gardiner's Battery, one of the \\"retired\\" batteries built in the 1850s. Piles of shells are visible behind the gunners. Jones's recommendations were immediately accepted and put into practice. A series of new batteries aligned on a roughly north-south axis facing west towards the harbour was constructed, including Jones', Civil Hospital, Raglan's, Gardiner's, Queen Victoria's, Lady Augusta's, Prince of Wales and Cumberland batteries. Further batteries and fortifications were constructed around Rosia Bay near the south of the peninsula and Windmill Hill was strengthened around its entire perimeter, with Retrenched Barracks at its north end blocking access to the higher ground behind. The sea wall in the town was straightened and strengthened with the building of two new curtain walls, Prince Albert's Front and Wellington Front. Defensive breakwaters were constructed in front of both to prevent an armoured enemy ship ramming the walls.Hughes & Migos, p. 91 Gibraltar's guns were reorganised and upgraded from 1856. Many of the 24-pounder guns were replaced with 32-pounders and the retired batteries were equipped with 68-pounders. A wide variety of old guns was still in use, including iron-cast 6-, 12- and 18-pounder, which complicated the supply and maintenance of the batteries. At its peak, the fortress had 681 guns in 110 batteries and positions. As the British artist William Henry Bartlett put it in 1851, \\"Ranges of batteries rising from the sea, tier above tier, extend along its entire sea-front, at the northern extremity of which is the town ; every nook in the crags bristles with artillery\\".Bartlett, p. 128 However, only a decade later the rapid introduction of rifled artillery firing explosive shells was already beginning to make the fortifications obsolete. As a result of recommendations by Colonel William Jervois, the coastal batteries were upgraded with armoured casemates made from expensively constructed iron laminates. He also proposed to build a sea fort in the bay, along the lines of Britain's Palmerston Forts, though this was never carried out.Hughes & Migos, p. 92‚Äì3 The 100 ton RML 17.72 inch gun installed at Napier of Magdala Battery In 1879 the growing threat of ultra-heavy naval artillery led to the installation of two giant RML 17.72 inch guns, dubbed the \\"100 ton guns\\" ‚Äì the biggest, heaviest and among the last muzzle-loading artillery pieces ever made. They were never used in anger and were not particularly reliable, suffering from a rate of fire of only one shot every four minutes.Hughes & Migos, p. 125 They were soon replaced by more reliable and powerful breech-loading guns and the process of pulling back the guns to retired sites continued until it reached its logical end point of situating the principal batteries on the very peak of the Rock, above sea level. At this height, weather and communications became serious problems. Gibraltar is prone to a weather formation called the Levanter cloud, which often obscures the top of the Rock. Telegraphic cables were installed criss- crossing the Rock to allow the batteries to communicate with observation posts situated lower down. The observers would plot the movement of enemy targets and transmit the coordinates to the batteries high above.Hughes & Migos, p. 128 The conversion of Gibraltar's armament to breech-loading guns led to a further reappraisal of the fortress's defensive needs in 1888. A report by Generals William Howley Goodenough and Sir Lothian Nicholson, the governor at the time, recommended reducing and standardising the guns to make them easier to maintain and supply. quick-firing guns and machine guns were introduced in the coastal positions and 9.2-inch guns were installed in the retired batteries. The smaller guns would be sufficient to protect against fast-moving enemy vessels, such as torpedo boats, while the larger guns could cover the entire Strait as far as the North African shore and could fire right over the Rock to counter-bombard land-based artillery. Fourteen 9.2-inch guns were eventually installed, along with another fourteen 6-inch guns, to provide Gibraltar's primary artillery defences.Hughes & Migos, p. 130 Another four 4-inch and ten 12-pounder guns were installed in various strategic positions, mostly along the coastline, to provide inshore defence.Fa and Finlayson, p. 36 =Twentieth century= Searchlights pierce the night sky during an air-raid practice on Gibraltar, 20 November 1942 By the start of the 20th century it was clear that Gibraltar could be bombarded with relative impunity from the Spanish mainland. Proposals were put forward to build a new harbour on the east side of the Rock, where ships would be less vulnerable to direct artillery fire from the mainland, but were abandoned due to the vast expense and only marginal gains in security.Jackson, p. 258 A new round of tunnelling was carried out to provide more bombproof accommodation for the garrison, along with deep shelters and casemates capable of accommodating 2,000 men. Ultimately it was decided in 1906 that Gibraltar faced no credible threat from land and that the defences would be organised to deal with a threat from the sea.Hughes & Migos, p. 134 In the event, the biggest threat Gibraltar faced in the 20th century came from the air. The only action seen by Gibraltar's coastal defences during the First World War occurred in August 1917 when the 6-inch gun at Devil's Gap Battery engaged and sank a German U-boat travelling on the surface. The Second World War presented a much greater challenge to Gibraltar's defences as a result of the development of long-range bomber aircraft.Hughes & Migos, p. 141 Numerous anti-aircraft positions were established across Gibraltar, many of them built on top of existing fortifications and equipped with 40mm and 3.7-inch anti-aircraft guns.Fa and Finlayson, p. 45 By March 1941 there were twenty-eight 3.7-inch guns and twenty-two (and eventually forty-eight) Bofors guns, plus two pom-pom guns. Numerous searchlights were installed ‚Äì by 1942 there were twenty-four located around Gibraltar ‚Äì and rocket projectors, an early though rather ineffectual form of anti-aircraft missiles, were also brought in.Hughes & Migos, p. 151 Bunkers and pillboxes were built to guard against amphibious landings, especially on the eastern side of the Rock, and anti-tank guns, ditches and obstacles were installed facing the isthmus to guard against a land attack.Fa and Finlayson, p. 46 The possibility of an attack from the land was not a theoretical concern, as Adolf Hitler sought Spanish support to carry out Operation Felix, an invasion of Gibraltar that would have enabled the Germans to close the entrance to the Mediterranean to the great disadvantage of the Allies. It was projected that Gibraltar would fall within only three days.Jackson, p. 282 In the event, Hitler failed to reach an agreement with the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco.Jackson, p. 283 Gibraltar's defences were tested several times by air raids carried out by Italy and Vichy France, which only caused limited damage and light casualties, and by Italian submarine and sabotage attacks which damaged or sank a number of ships in the bay.Hughes & Migos, p. 150 Royal Engineers tunnelling in Gibraltar, 1 November 1941 Despite the pinprick nature of the Axis attacks, a huge amount of work was done during the war to develop Gibraltar's fortifications further. A new network of tunnels was dug under the Rock to accommodate a vastly increased garrison. The tunnels became what amounted to an underground city, secure from bombardment and capable of sheltering 16,000 men. They included a hospital, storerooms, workshops, ammunition magazines, a bakery, food stores capable of holding enough rations to feed the entire garrison for sixteen months, a power station, a water distillation plant and a telephone exchange.Hughes & Migos, p. 153 Much of the spoil was used to build a runway across the isthmus and extending into the bay, with an eventual length of and a width of .Fa and Finlayson, p. 47 The Royal Air Force base on Gibraltar supported Allied air operations in the Battle of the Atlantic, the Mediterranean and North Africa. During Operation Torch in 1942, over 600 Allied aircraft were crammed onto Gibraltar's single runway.Rose (2001), p. 107 Following the Second World War, changes in Britain's military commitments and the strategic environment eventually made Gibraltar's role as a fortress superfluous. The Royal Navy's historic role in the Mediterranean was effectively taken over by the United States Sixth Fleet and Britain's strategic interests shifted to the Atlantic.Hughes & Migos, p. 153 Some further work took place between 1958‚Äì68 when Gibraltar was used as a NATO monitoring station to observe naval traffic through the Strait.Fa and Finlayson, p. 53 Linking tunnels were dug to connect the existing tunnels, new storage chambers and reservoirs were built and access routes to permit easier movement between areas of the peninsula were constructed. The tunnelling work came to an end in April 1968, marking the end of the British Army's 200 years of tunnel-building.Rose (2001), p. 112 The 9.2 inch guns mounted on the Upper Ridge of the Rock remained in service until 7 April 1976 when the guns of Lord Airey's, O'Hara's and Spur Batteries were all fired for the last time.Hughes & Migos, p. 365 In October 1985, a single battery of Exocet anti-ship missiles was installed on the Rock;Exocet Deployed, The Montreal Gazette, October 25, 1985 (p. 15) they were a specially adapted version of the MM38 ship borne missile known as \\"Excalibur\\" and were directed by a Type 1006 radar. The system had reportedly been withdrawn by 1997.Friedman, Norman (1997), The Naval Institute Guide to World Naval Weapons Systems, 1997-1998, The US Naval Institute, Annapolis, Maryland, (p.227) During the 1980s and 1990s, the British Ministry of Defence closed Gibraltar's naval dockyard and greatly reduced the military presence in the territory, leaving the locally raised Royal Gibraltar Regiment as the main military force in Gibraltar. Gibraltar's fortifications today Many of Gibraltar's fortifications were already redundant well before the British garrison was withdrawn from the territory in the 1990s, and the rapid military rundown in the 1980s and the 1990s left the civilian authorities with a large amount of surplus military property. Many of the best-preserved fortifications are in the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, a conservation area that covers about 40% of the area of Gibraltar. A few of the Upper Rock batteries have been preserved intact; all four of the 5.25-inch guns at Princess Anne's Battery are still in place, making it the only place in the world where a complete 5.25-inch battery can still be seen. The 9.2 inch guns at Breakneck, Lord Airey's and O'Hara's Batteries are still in situ and can now be visited. Elsewhere, most of the ordnance has been removed. Two surviving 6-inch guns remain at Devil's Gap Battery, one of which is the gun that engaged a German U-boat in August 1917.Fa and Finlayson, p. 58 At Napier of Magdala Battery one of the two 100-ton RML 17.72 inch guns is still in situ and has been restored, along with a 3.7 inch quick-firing anti-aircraft gun. The site is now run by the Gibraltar Tourist Board in conjunction with the Nature Reserve.Fa and Finlayson, p. 57 Some of the 18th and 20th century tunnels can also be visited. The Upper Galleries (now known as the Great Siege Tunnels) on the North Face of the Rock of Gibraltar are a popular tourist attraction within the Nature Reserve. A number of tableaux have been installed to recreate the appearance of the original 18th century gun batteries housed within the tunnels. They include a number of Victorian 64-pounder cannon on original Gibraltar gun carriages.Fa and Finlayson, p. 54 The Middle Galleries, where World War II tunnelling joins the original 18th century tunnels, are open under the name of the \\"World War II Tunnels\\". The Lower Galleries are not open to visitors, as they are in a poor condition due to vandalism and neglect, but still contain many relics of their former military usage. Many of the fortifications at sea level have survived, though not always in their original condition. A substantial number have been built over. The Inundation was drained after World War II and is now the site of the Laguna Estate, named after the Inundation's lagoon. The glacis was likewise used as the foundations of the Glacis Estate. The flat ground of the retired batteries made them prime building spots during Gibraltar's post-war building boom, thus many of them have disappeared under recent developments. The city walls have almost entirely survived and are progressively being cleared of modern structures to restore them to something more like their original appearance. However, they are no longer at the water's edge due to extensive land reclamation.Fa and Finlayson, p. 55 Various parts of the fortifications have been converted to civilian use. After being used for some years as a hostel for Moroccan migrant workers, the Grand Casemates Barracks have been renovated and converted into restaurants and shops. An electricity generating station was built inside the King's Bastion in the 1960s but has since been demolished and the bastion has been converted into a leisure centre. The North Front defences, still following the course laid out by the Moors in the 11th century, are still substantially intact. A significant portion of the original Spanish and Moorish walls can still be seen, rising in a saw-tooth (en cr√©maill√®re) fashion from the Grand Battery.Fa and Finlayson, p. 58 Although gaps have been cut in the walls to allow vehicle traffic to enter the city centre, pedestrians can still walk over the wooden drawbridge over the North Front ditch to pass through the Landport Gate into the city. The Moorish Tower of Homage continues to stand above the Grand Battery on the lower slopes of the Rock. It is now open to the public as part of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve.Fa and Finlayson, pp. 55‚Äì6 The walls of the South Front are also substantially intact. The Southport Gates still bear the arms of Charles V, with columns on either side representing the Pillars of Hercules entwined with scrolls reading \\"plus ultra\\", the national motto of Spain. Flanking the base of the royal arms are the arms of Gibraltar and of one of the Spanish governors.Fa and Finlayson, p. 22 The ditch that once adjoined the gates has largely been filled in, though a portion of it was reused to create the Trafalgar Cemetery adjoining the Southport Gates. Further south, the upper section of Charles V Wall is intact and can be walked on; the lowest point of this section, Prince Ferdinand's Battery, is now the site of the Apes' Den, where many of Gibraltar's colony of Barbary macaques live. Many of the clifftop defences and gun emplacements in the far south of the peninsula are still visible, though some have been built on and others have been turned into viewing platforms. Conserving the fortifications The preservation of Gibraltar's fortifications, and of its architectural heritage in general, has been a problematic issue. The peninsula is extremely short of land; in the early 1980s, nearly half the available land was in military usage, comprising the naval dockyard, the whole of the southern part of Gibraltar, the upper part of the Rock and a significant amount of property within the city walls, in addition to the runway and military facilities on the isthmus. Until recently, Gibraltar had no public sea front of its own due to military land usage.Binney & Martin, p. 11 As the military presence has been run down, MOD property has been handed over to the Government of Gibraltar but the latter has lacked the resources to look after all of the buildings and land that have been transferred. This has led to the abandonment and severe physical deterioration of significant parts of Gibraltar's military heritage.Binney & Martin, p. 13 A prime example is that of the Northern Defences, consisting of the King's Lines, Queen's Lines and Prince's Lines overlooking the isthmus and the entrance to Gibraltar. Mostly dating during the Great Siege and shortly after, they have been described as \\"not merely one of the most, perhaps the most, hauntingly vivid experiences of a visit to Gibraltar . . . [standing] comparison with some of the most famous military sites in the world.\\"Binney & Martin, p. 18 As John Harris of the Royal Institute of British Architects has put it, they are \\"capable of providing one of the great architectural experiences in the western world . . . the atmosphere of the Great Siege is vivid and evocative in the extreme.\\"Harris, p. 7 The Gibraltar Conservation Society proposed a ¬£500,000 scheme in the early 1980s to preserve and reopen the Lines and the surrounding batteries, galleries and bombproof magazines, but the scheme did not go ahead and the Lines have continued to be neglected and vandalised despite being scheduled as an Ancient Monument.Allan, p. 9 See also * List of fortifications of Gibraltar * Tunnels of Gibraltar * Fortifications of Malta References Bibliography   ","title":"Fortifications of Gibraltar"},{"id":"39366658","title":"Marco Baliani"},{"id":"39366664","text":"Maksym Mykolaiovych Kokosha (; born August 9, 1983 in Kyiv) is a Ukrainian former swimmer, who specialized in freestyle events.

The mainshock occurred at a depth of and generated a high tsunami that devastated the coastal areas of Romania and Bulgaria. In Romania, the earthquake was felt not only throughout Northern Dobruja, but also in Oltenia and Muntenia, and even in southern Moldova. The earthquake was followed by a large number of local replicas and secondary earthquakes, which continued until 1905; the strongest aftershocks reached magnitudes of 5.5‚Äì6.0 on the Richter scale and were also felt in southern Romania, including Bucharest. After 1905, Pontic seismic activity began to subside, although weak and moderate earthquakes were also reported in subsequent years. Such events are rare in the Black Sea. In the last 200 years, in the Black Sea region 24 tsunamis occurred, of which two were in the territory of Dobruja. The earliest recorded tsunami in Romania dates from 104, when the city of Callatis, current Mangalia, was badly affected.  Background  The off-shore region of Southern Dobruja, especially the epicentral area located in the south of Mangalia, including the Bulgarian off-shore of the Black Sea, has been emphasized over the years, by earthquakes which in certain cases have been violent, reaching magnitudes of 7‚Äì7.5 on Richter scale. These are also crustal earthquakes, of low depth (), with severe effects on the epicentral area. Sometimes, in case of earthquakes with underwater focus (as those located in the east of Shabla Cape), tsunami waves were generated, like in 1901. Research studies carried out by experts have shown that Pontic earthquakes with destructive behaviour, comparable to that in 1901, repeat at mean periods of 300‚Äì500 years. One of the earliest occurred in the 1st century BC at Kavarna. In AD 853, a tsunami at Varna swept inland over flat coastal plain and travelled up a river.\\"Seismic risk in Romania\\", Bauhaus-University Weimar The Black Sea is considered one of the most violent seas due to its seismic activity.  Impact   Felt area  The shock was felt throughout Bulgaria, southeast Romania, eastern Serbia and northwest Anatolia, causing great panic in Istanbul and on the Asiatic coast of the Bosphorus and the Marmara. Long period effects lasting about a minute were reported from the Danube valley, from Szeged in Hungary, and from Odessa. The shock was perceptible in Thessaloniki, in Macedonia, in Dorohoi in Romania, and throughout the province of Sivas.  Damage  The earthquake had devastating consequences in the coastal area of southern Mangalia, many villages being ruined (maximum intensity of X on the Mercalli intensity scale); likewise, the earthquake generated a high tsunami wave and there occurred bank dislocations and other local geomorphological phenomena.\\"Cutremure »ôi tsunami √Æn Constan»õa\\", Ziua de Constan»õa, May 1, 2009 Maximum damage was sustained by a small number of villages situated on the alluvial lowlands along the coast between Balchik, Kavarna, Durankulak and Limanu. Slumping of the coast destroyed many landing-places and coastal settlements including the lighthouse at Kaliakra. Largescale landslides along the coast continued to develop for almost two weeks after the earthquake, disrupting communications and causing additional damage. In Bucharest, the seismic intensity was V‚ÄìVI degrees on the Mercalli intensity scale, causing panic among the population and light damage to buildings. The Bulgarian province of Dobrich was also severely hit by tsunami. In several localities, including Balchik, homes were rushed by waters.\\"Tsunami hazard in the Black Sea and the Azov Sea: a new tsunami catalogue\\", Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences In the village of Momchil, a large landslide buried people's homes on an area of about .

His two sons Nathan and Kristopher played the game but were held back by the belief that they would follow in their father's footsteps and therefore many teams did not want to make the commitment. It is believed that Kristopher the older son was considered better than Colin, especially when compared to ability at the ages of each player when people compared the two. He also decided to retire in 2014 at the age of 27. His son Nathan plays in the amateur league in Northern Ireland.

In 1977-1979, he taught sculpting and lectured on environmental sculpture at Oranim Teachers College. He also taught at the Technion in Haifa and the Ein Hod artist's colony. Shemi was a member of New Horizons group.Yechiel Shemi After a show in the United States in the 1960s, the Museum of Modern Art acquired his work. Shemi was the first Israeli artist to have his work purchased by the MoMa.Williams College Museum of Art Shemi won the Sandberg Prize in 1981 and the Israel Prize for sculpture in 1986. In 1966 and 1997, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art mounted exhibitions of his work.Yechiel Shemi  Haifa, Bet Haarava 1922- 1948  Yehiel Shemi, (born Yehiel Stizberg), was born in 1922, to parents Moshe and Esther Stizberg. When he was two months old Yehiel with his family immigrated to the Mandate Israel and settled in Haifa. At the age of 14 he joined a youth movement called \\"The Working Camps\\". It was at this time that he started studying art with Paul K. Henich. In 1938 Stizberg was one of the founders of Kibbutz Beit HaArava which is located north of the Dead Sea. Alongside his agricultural work, Stizberg was interested in art. First he created landscape drawings and paintings, but then moved onto sculpting. In 1942 Stizberg joined his friend Yitzhak Danziger's studio where he painted for 3 months. In 1945 Stizberg changed his last name to Shemi and joined the HeHalutz Movement as a courier activist. Up until 1948 Shemi continued as a missionary in Italy, France and Egypt to fulfill his job. Shemi then went to New York as a missionary where he studied with Chaim Gross, there Shemi was exposed and became acquainted with modern art and art history.  Artist in Kibbutz, Kabri 1949-1955 During the independence war Kibbutz Bet Haarava has abandoned and since Shemi was in New York at the time his artwork that was left in the kibbutz was abandoned or got lost. In 1949 after Shemi came back from the states he founded and lived in Kibbutz Kabri, Israel in the Galil. During the years 1950-52 Shemi worked as the kibbutz secretary and worked with Avigdor Stematsky and Joseph Zaritsky. He was influenced by them and in 1952 he became a member of New Horizons Group. In 1954 (the year he won a Dizengoff Prize) the members of the Kibbutz decided that Shemi would be able to work solely on his sculpting and art, assuming that his art work would bring money into the Kabri Kibbutz.  Injured Bird 1955-1961 In the mid 1950s Shemi's artwork changed drastically, one of the changes he made was changing his material for his sculptures from wood and stone to metal materials. His first metal bird sculpture was made in 1955. During the years 1955-1957 Shemi created a series of sculptures of abstract figures of animals and humans. A few of these sculptures were exhibited in the seventh exhibition of New Horizons that opened in 1957 at the Independence Hall (Israel). Exhibiting some 30 sculptures by Shemi. During 1957-1956, Shemi created the sculpture group \\"Nest\\".  Ripped Iron 1962- 1970 This period was one of the most productive of his life. In 1962 Shemi began to create expressive works. The raw material used in these sculpture was mostly scrap metal. During the 1960s Yehiel Shemi introduced his assemblage sculpture in the solo exhibitions at Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels in 1964. Yehiel Shemi had additional solo exhibitions at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 1966 and at the Israel Museum in 1967. Shemi also created at this time two large public statues. In 1966 Shemi moved to Kibbutz Gadot for a half year.  1970-1992  In the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s Shemi changed the technique used in his sculptures. Instead of using ready-made objects, he reduced his art to geometric shapes. In 1981 Shemi was awarded the Sandberg Prize from the Israel Museum. In 1986, the Israel Prize for sculpture, together with Batia Lishansky.

Published in Barcelona between 1872 and 1939, it was well known for its pro-republican and anti-clerical stance and would become one of the most important Catalan publications of all times. History L'Esquella de la Torratxa, meaning \\"the cowbell of the turret\\", was first published on 5 May 1872. It began during an officially-decreed suspension of the publication of La Campana de Gr√†cia, a more overtly political magazine. It would, however, become very critical of Barcelona mayor Francisco R√≠os Taulet and his promotion of the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition which was seen by many as a wasteful extravagancy. The magazine had a succession of directors along its existence, beginning with Jos√© Roca Roca, followed by others such as Mario Aguilar, Prudencio Bertrana and Pedro Calderos. Among the most notable article writers for the magazine were Santiago Rusi√±ol, under the pen name \\"Xarau\\", Prudencio Bertrana, Francisco Curet, Antonio Rovira Virgilio, Gabriel Alomar and Mario Aguilar.Joan Torrent & Rafael Tasis, Hist√≤ria de la premsa catalana.

The involvement of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in World War II began with its invasion by German forces on 10 May 1940 and lasted beyond its liberation by Allied forces in late 1944 and early 1945. Luxembourg was placed under occupation and was annexed into Germany in 1942. During the occupation, the German authorities orchestrated a programme of \\"Germanisation\\" of the country, suppressing non-German languages and customs and conscripting Luxembourgers into the Wehrmacht, which led to extensive resistance, culminating in a general strike in August 1942 against conscription. The Germanisation was facilitated by a collaborationist political group, the Volksdeutsche Bewegung, founded shortly after the occupation. Shortly before the surrender, the government had fled the country along with Grand Duchess Charlotte, eventually arriving in London, where a Government-in-exile was formed. Luxembourgish soldiers also fought in Allied units until liberation. Background The Luxembourg government had pursued a policy of neutrality since the Luxembourg Crisis of 1867 had highlighted the country's vulnerability. During the First World War, the 400 men of the Corps des Gendarmes et Volontaires had remained in barracks throughout the German occupation. In March 1939, in a speech to the Reichstag, Adolf Hitler promised that Luxembourg sovereignty would not be breached. The strength of the military was gradually increased as international tension rose during Appeasement and after Britain and France's declaration of war against Germany in September 1939. By 1940, the Luxembourg army numbered some 13 officers, 255 armed gendarmes and 425 soldiers. The popular English-language radio station Radio Luxembourg was taken off-air in September 1939, amid fears that it might antagonize the Germans. Apart from that, normal life continued in Luxembourg during the Phoney War; no blackout was enforced and regular trains to France and Germany continued. In Spring 1940, work began on a series of roadblocks across Luxembourg's eastern border with Germany. The fortifications, known as the Schuster Line, were largely made of steel and concrete. German invasion German armored car in the Ardennes during Fall Gelb, May 1940 On 9 May 1940, after increased troop movements around the German border, the barricades of the Schuster Line were closed. The German invasion of Luxembourg, part of Fall Gelb (\\"Case Yellow\\"), began at 04:35 on the same day as the attacks on Belgium and the Netherlands. An attack by German agents in civilian clothes against the Schuster Line and radio stations was however repulsed. The invading forces encountered little resistance from the Luxembourg military who were confined in their barracks. By noon, the capital city had fallen. The invasion was accompanied by an exodus of tens of thousands of civilians to France and the surrounding countries to escape the invasion. At 08:00, several French divisions crossed the frontier from the Maginot Line and skirmished with the German forces before retreating. The invasion cost 7 Luxembourg soldiers wounded, with 1 British pilot and 5 French Spahis killed in action. German occupation Life under occupation A propaganda poster declaring, 'Luxemberger, you are German; your mothertongue is German' (Luxemburger du bist Deutsch; Deine Muttersprache ist Deutsch) The departure of the government left the state functions of Luxembourg in disorder. An administrative council under Albert Wehrer was formed in Luxembourg to attempt to reach an agreement with the occupiers whereby Luxembourg could continue to preserve some independence while remaining a Nazi protectorate, and called for the return of the Grand Duchess. All possibility of compromise was eventually lost when Luxembourg was effectively incorporated into the German Gau Koblenz-Trier (renamed Gau Moselland in 1942) and all its own government functions were abolished from July 1940, unlike occupied Belgium and the Netherlands which preserved their state functions under German control. From August 1942, Luxembourg was officially made part of Germany. From August 1940, speaking French was forbidden by proclamation of Gustav Simon in order to encourage the integration of the territory into Germany, proclaimed by posters carrying the slogan \\"Your language is German and only German\\"\\"Eure Sprache sei deutsch und nur deutsch\\" This led to a popular revival of the traditional Luxembourgish language, which had not been prohibited, as a form of passive resistance. From August 1942, all male Luxembourgers of draft age were conscripted into the German armed forces. Altogether, 12,000 Luxembourgers served in the German military, of whom nearly 3,000 died during the war. Collaboration The most significant collaborationist group in the country was the Volksdeutsche Bewegung (VdB). Formed by Damian Kratzenberg shortly after the occupation, the VdB campaigned for the incorporation of Luxembourg into Germany with the slogan \\"Heim ins Reich\\" (\\"Home to the Reich\\"). The VdB had 84,000 members at its height, but coercion was widely exercised to encourage enlistment. All manual workers were forced into the German Labour Front (DAF) from 1941 and certain age groups of both genders were conscripted into the Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD) to work on military projects. Membership of the Nazi youth movement, the \\"Luxemburger Volksjugend\\" (LVJ), which had been created with little success in 1936, was encouraged and it later merged into the Hitler Youth. Conscription was introduced in Luxembourg from August 1942 under the same terms as in Germany. 12,000 men were conscripted, of whom 3,000 were killed in action, died of wounds or were posted missing-presumed dead. A further 1,500 were wounded. Resistance 1942 General Strike. Armed resistance to the German occupiers began in winter 1940‚Äì41 when a number of small groups were formed across the country. Each had differing political objectives and some were directly affiliated to pre-war political parties, social groups (like the Scouts) or groups of students or workers. Because of the small size of the pre-war Luxembourgish military, weapons were difficult to come by and so the resistance fighters were rarely armed until much later in the war. Nevertheless, the resistance was heavily involved in printing anti-German leaflets and, from 1942, hiding \\"R√©fractaires\\" (those avoiding German military service) in safe houses, and in some cases providing networks to escort them out of the country safely. One Luxembourger, Victor Bodson (who was also a minister in the Government in Exile), was awarded the title Righteous Among the Nations by the State of Israel for helping about 100 Jews escape from Luxembourg during the occupation. Information gathered by the Luxembourgish resistance was extremely important. One Luxembourgish resistant, L√©on-Henri Roth, informed the allies of the existence of the secret Peenem√ºnde Army Research Center on the Baltic coast, allowing the allies to bomb it from the air. In Autumn 1944, many resistance organizations merged to form the \\"Unio'n vun de Fr√§iheetsorganisatiounen\\" or Unio'n. In November 1944, a group of 30 Luxembourgish resistance members commanded by Victor Abens was attacked by Waffen SS soldiers in the castle at Vianden. In the battle which followed, 23 Germans were killed by the resistance, who only lost one man killed during the operation although they were forced to withdraw to Allied lines. =Passive resistance= Non-violent passive resistance was widespread in Luxembourg during the period. From August 1940, the \\"Sp√©ngelskrich\\" (the \\"War of Pins\\") took place as Luxembourgers wore patriotic pin-badges (depicting the national colours or the Grand duchess), precipitating attacks from the VdB. In October 1941, the German occupiers took a survey of Luxembourgish civilians who were asked to state their nationality, their mother tongue and their racial group, but contrary to German expectations, 95% answered \\"Luxembourgish\\" to each question. The refusal to declare themselves as German citizens led to mass arrests. Conscription was particularly unpopular. On 31 August 1942, shortly after the announcement that conscription would be extended to all men born between 1920 and 1927, a strike began in the northern town of Wiltz. The strike spread rapidly, paralysing the factories and industries of Luxembourg. The strike was quickly repressed and its leaders arrested. 20 were summarily tried before a special tribunal (in German, a \\"Standgericht\\") and executed by firing squad at nearby Hinzert concentration camp. Nevertheless, protests against conscription continued and 3,500 Luxembourgers would desert the German army after being conscripted. Holocaust A Nazi parade by the Synagogue in Luxembourg in 1941. It was destroyed in 1943. Before the war, Luxembourg had a population of about 3500 Jews, many of them newly arrived in the country to escape persecution in Germany. The Nuremberg Laws, which had applied in Germany since 1935, were enforced in Luxembourg from September 1940 and Jews were encouraged to leave the country for Vichy France. Emigration was forbidden in October 1941, but not before nearly 2500 had fled. In practice they were little better off in Vichy France, and many of those who left were later deported and killed. From September 1941, all Jews in Luxembourg were forced to wear the yellow Star of David badge to identify them. From October 1941, Nazi authorities began to deport the around 800 remaining Jews from Luxembourg to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto and the concentration camps at Theresienstadt and Auschwitz. Around 700 were deported from the Transit Camp at Fuenfbrunnen in Ulflingen in the north of Luxembourg. Luxembourg was declared \\"Judenrein\\" (\\"cleansed of Jews\\") except for those in hiding on 19 October 1941. Only 36 of the Jewish population of Luxembourg to have been sent to concentration camps are known to have survived to the end of the war. Free Luxembourg Forces and the government-in-exile Soldiers from Luxembourg training in Britain, 1943. The Government in Exile first fled to Paris, then after the Fall of France, to Lisbon and then the United Kingdom. While the Government established itself in Wilton Crescent in the Belgravia area of London, the Grand Duchess and her family moved to Francophone Montreal in Canada. The government in exile was vocal in stressing the Luxembourg cause in newspapers in allied countries and succeeded in obtaining Luxembourgish language broadcasts to the occupied country on BBC radio. In 1944, the government in exile signed a treaty with the Belgian and Dutch governments, creating the Benelux Economic Union and also signed into the Bretton Woods system. Luxembourg's military involvement could play only a \\"symbolic role\\" for the allied cause, and numerous Luxembourgers fought in allied armies. From March 1944, Luxembourg soldiers operated four 25 pounder guns, christened Elisabeth, Marie Adelaide, Marie Gabriele and Alix after the Grand duchess' daughters, as part of C Troop, 1st Belgian Field Artillery Battery of the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade, commonly known as the \\"Brigade Piron\\" after its commander Jean-Baptiste Piron. The Troop numbered some 80 men. The battery landed in Normandy with the Brigade Piron on 6 August 1944 and served in the Battle of Normandy and was involved in the Liberation of Brussels in September 1944. Prince Jean, son of the Grand Duchess and future Grand Duke, served in the Irish Guards from 1942. Liberation The Flag of Luxembourg flying from the Hospital in Wiltz shortly after its liberation by the American 4th Armoured Division, 25 December 1944. Luxembourg was liberated by Allied forces in September 1944. Allied tanks entered the capital city on 10 September 1944, where the Germans retreated without fighting. The Allied advance triggered the resistance to rise up: at Vianden, members of the Luxembourgish resistance fought a much larger German force at the Battle of Vianden Castle. In mid December, the Germans launched the \\"Ardennes Offensive\\" in Luxembourg and the Belgian Ardennes. Though the city of Luxembourg remained in Allied hands throughout, much of the north of the country was lost to German forces and had to be liberated again. Gustav Simon, the Nazi Gauleiter responsible for Moselland and Luxembourg, fled but was captured and imprisoned by the British Army. He committed suicide in an Allied prison. In Luxembourg too, collaborators were imprisoned and tried. Damian Kratzenberg, founder and leader of VdB, was one of those executed for his role. Two German V-3 cannon with a range of were used to bombard the city of Luxembourg from December 1944 until February 1945. Battle of the Bulge Most of Luxembourg was rapidly liberated in September 1944 when the front line stabilized behind the Our and Sauer Rivers along the Luxembourg-German frontier. Following the campaign in Brittany, the U.S. VIII Corps occupied the sector of the front line in Luxembourg. On December 16, 1944, elements of the U.S. 28th and 4th Infantry Divisions, as well as a combat command of the 9th Armored Division were defending the line of the Our and Sauer Rivers when the German offensive started. German Volksgrenadier in Luxembourg, December 1944. The initial defensive efforts of the U.S. troops hinged upon holding towns near the international frontier. As a result, the towns of Clervaux, Marnach, Holzthum, Consthum, Weiler, and Wahlhausen were used as strongholds by the Americans and attacked by the Germans, who wanted to achieve control of the road networks in northern Luxembourg in order for their forces to move westward. After the Americans in northern Luxembourg were forced to retreat by the German attacks, the area experienced a second passage of the front line during January‚ÄìFebruary 1945, this time moving generally eastward as the U.S. Third Army attacked into the southern flank of the German penetration (the \\"Bulge\\"). Vianden was the final community in Luxembourg to be liberated on 12 February 1945. Because of the determination of both sides to prevail on the battlefield, the combat in Luxembourg was bitter and correspondingly hard on the civilian population. Over 2,100 homes in Luxembourg were destroyed in the fighting and more than 1,400 others seriously damaged. It is also estimated that some 500 Luxembourgish non-combatants lost their lives during the Battle of the Bulge. Besides the dead, over 45,000 Luxembourgers became refugees during the battle. Aftermath The experience of invasion and occupation during the war led to a shift in Luxembourg's stance on neutrality. Luxembourg signed the Treaty of Brussels with other western European powers on 17 March 1948 as part of the initial European postwar security cooperation and in a move that foreshadowed Luxembourg's membership in NATO. Luxembourg also began greater military co-operation with Belgium after the war, training soldiers together and even sending a joint contingent to fight in the Korean War in 1950. Following the war, Luxembourgish troops took part in the occupation of West Germany, contributing troops that were part of the force in the French Zone, beginning in late 1945. Luxembourgish forces functioned under overall French command within the zone and were responsible for the areas of Bitburg and Eifel and parts of Saarburg. They were withdrawn from Saarburg in 1948, and from Bitburg-Eifel in July 1955.

When the coach tells Chandler and Fowler that Jim is nervous and erratic, Chandler invites Jim to spend the night before the big game at his home.

Joseph was born around 1640/1650 and his origins are uncertain. In his first years as clockmaker, his workshop was located in St Martin's Le Grand, and his house was in Blow Bladder Street, before moving to Mark Lane End in Tower Street in 1687. In 1699 he was elected as the youngest Warden of the Clockmakers' Company, and sat on committees alongside Thomas Tompion, preceding him as Master of the Company in 1702, as well as alongside Charles Gretton (Master of the Company in 1700). His son Thomas completed his apprenticeship, subsequently working as a journeyman, and free of the Clockmakers' Company in about 1695. Thomas also served as Master of the Company, in 1718. The partnership J & T Windmills also took over Thomas Tompion's clock maintenance contract at the Tower of London and at Woolwich and other Crown contracts. Windmills was regarded as one of the finest clockmakers in seventeenth century London, producing a large number of lantern clocks, bracket clocks, longcase clocks and pocket watches. His earliest watch, displayed in the British Museum, was made before 1680 and did not make use of a balance spring. Thomas Tompion's sprung balance transformed the pocket watch from ornamental item into an accurate timepiece. Joseph's last recorded attendance at the Court of the Clockmakers' Company was on 24 October 1723, ending a membership of more than thirty-two years. He died in 1724, having spent fifty-two years at his trade. Thomas then ran the company until his death in 1737. Thomas died childless and thus was the last of the Windmills' male line. The name \\"J & T Windmills\\" is currently used by a watchmaker with no links to the original father-and-son team.

Context Duckmanton Junction (sometimes referred to as Duckmanton Junctions) is the collective name for four interrelated junctions built by the GCR to connect its main line to the LD&ECR;'s main line when it took the latter company over in 1907. The junction opened for goods traffic on 22 September 1907 and for passengers on 1 October 1907. The junctions would nowadays be described as \\"grade separated\\". Layout The four junctions were: *Arkwright Town Junction, controlled by Arkwright Town signal box, *Duckmanton East Junction, controlled by Duckmanton East signal box, *Duckmanton North Junction, controlled by Duckmanton North signal box, and *Duckmanton South Junction, controlled by Duckmanton South signal box. The GC main line ran north‚Äìsouth, whereas the LD&ECR; line ran east‚Äìwest. The former bridged the latter at a right angle a short distance west of Arkwright Town station. The GCR's key hope in connecting the lines was to carry coal from the LD&ECR;'s catchment area to markets further south, notably London. It also foresaw the possibility of traffic from the LD&ECR;'s intended Immingham Dock (which would open in 1912) having an alternative route for coal from the GCR's Derbyshire catchment area. As a result, the junction provision was, by any standards, lavish. It far exceeded the traffic it ever carried. The whole was laid and signalled to passenger standards and a \\"fast\\" service was tried from Lincoln to Nottingham, connecting with expresses to London Marylebone. This took two hours to Nottingham (compared with the Midland Railway's fast time of under an hour) and five hours to London (compared with the Great Northern's 3 hrs 30 mins.) By 1910 this service consisted of a single carriage. Northbound it was slipped at Leicester off the 15:15 from Marylebone. It was worked forward via Nottingham Victoria and then turned east at Duckmanton Junction to Langwith Junction where it was attached to the 18:53 all stations to Lincoln where it arrived at 19:58. By 1922 there was no advertised passenger service using the junction, such trains as were run between Lincoln and Nottingham via ex-LD&ECR; metals turned south at Clipstone East Junction and called at Mansfield Central, offering a shorter journey with the possibility of extra business in Mansfield. Expected Traffic The junctions as a whole were laid out for east to north traffic (and vice versa) and for east to south traffic (and vice versa). This fitted the GC's aims, as described above. Traffic from the western end of the LD&ECR; would have to reverse at Arkwright Town Junction. There were two sources of such traffic, Chesterfield Market Place and Calow and Bonds Main collieries. The GC \\"solved\\" the latter by closing the LD&ECR; branch to them and using its own connections further south, thereby scoring an immediate win, as the LD&ECR; branch was steeply graded and difficult to work. Traffic to and from Chesterfield Market Place was mostly aimed east along the LD&ECR; and any which was aimed north or south could better be accommodated at the GCR station in Chesterfield. Train Routing A train travelling from east to north would turn north (right) at Arkwright Town Junction,Train between Arkwright Town Jct and Duckmanton East Jct: via flickr pass under the Chesterfield to Bolsover road (now the A632), bear north (right) at Duckmanton East Junction then join the GC main line at Duckmanton North Junction. The whole time on double tracks. North to east traffic would reverse the process. As built, this was seen as the minority flow, in accordance with the expectations set out above. East to south and south to east traffics were seen as the majority flows, so grade separation was employed. A train travelling from east to south would turn north (right) at Arkwright Town Junction, pass under the Chesterfield to Bolsover road, bear south (left) at Duckmanton East Junction then join the GC main line at Duckmanton South Junction. The section from Duckmanton East Junction to Duckmanton South Junction was single track, as shown in the upper image attached to this article. A train travelling from south to east would turn west (left) at Duckmanton South Junction, climb on a single track arc and cross the GC main line from southwest to northeast using a lattice girder bridge.Duckmanton Junction flyover via flickr It would then join the north to east line at Duckmanton East Junction, pass under the Chesterfield to Bolsover road and join the LD&ECR; main line at Arkwright Town Junction. Evolution The main development of the coal industry after 1907 occurred in the Mansfield area some distance to the east. When Immingham dock opened in 1912 it was natural for coal to go there directly rather than go west through Duckmanton Junction, north down the GC main line, then to the east. Some will have been routed from east to south via Duckmanton, but that was largely rendered redundant by the opening of the Mansfield Railway progressively from 1916. Duckmanton Junction became a white elephant, used on occasions for diversions, but otherwise just for local goods traffic. The two world wars saw increases in usage, only to revert after hostilities ceased. Arkwright colliery opened in 1938 and was connected to the LD&ECR; line by a sharply curving branch which was to provide a steady traffic flow for fifty years. Rundown The white elephant was delivered a mortal blow in December 1951 with the closure and lifting of the LD&ECR; from Markham Junction (about two miles east of Arkwright Town Junction) eastwards to Langwith Junction, by then renamed Shirebrook North. This meant that Duckmanton Junction had no role for any through traffic, actual or potential. From that point onwards just three local traffics passed through the complex of junctions: *a daily goods to and from Chesterfield Market Place also serving Arkwright Town *coal from Markham No. 1 and Bolsover collieries, and *coal from Arkwright colliery The Chesterfield Market Place goods was cut back to serve Arkwright Town station only from March 1957. It ceased altogether on 2 February 1963. Coal from Markham colliery to Langwith Junction, which had previously gone directly through Bolsover South and Scarcliffe was routed via Markham Junction (reverse) then Arkwright Town Junction, Duckmanton East Junction, Duckmanton North Junction then Killamarsh South Junction (reverse) and along the LD&ECR;'s Beighton branch. This remarkable perambulation didn't outlast the 1950s. The \\"1953 until further notice\\" Working Timetable (\\"WTT\\")Markham and Duckmanton Junctions 1953 WTT via flickr for Markham and Duckmanton Junctions,Markham and Duckmanton Junctions and associated collieries: via Old-Maps shows up to seven trains travelling north via Duckmanton North Junction and up to three travelling south via Duckmanton South Junction, Mondays to Saturdays. One was the daily goods from Chesterfield Market Place. The destinations beyond Staveley Central are a litany of Great Central achievements - Mottram, Neepsend (Sheffield), Immingham and Annesley. Inbound trains from the south came direct from Woodford. It is not clear from the timetable how much coal on these trains came from Arkwright, Bolsover or Markham No. 1 collieries. The small yard at Markham Junction served to marshal trains from Bolsover and Markham collieries and Arkwright coal may have been tripped there \\"under the radar\\" of the WTT. The arrangements at Markham Junction were the creation of the days of railway competition. As the maps show, both Bolsover and Markham No. 1 were connected to the ex-MR Doe Lea Branch and in any event both Markham collieries had an ex-GCR outlet northwards direct to Staveley Central. At some point between the WTT and June 1961 stopblocks were erected near the Longcourse Lane overbridge between Arkwright Town Junction and Markham Junction, which was closed. Markham Junction signalboxMarkham Junction and colliery branches: via shawnsanders closed in 1954. The branches to Bolsover and Markham No. 1 collieries were lifted. This benefitted the NCB which became able to extend its tip west of Buttermilk Lane by burying the \\"LNER Markham Branch\\" trackbed. It also benefitted Coalite which became able to use the area around the junction of the erstwhile Markham and Bolsover colliery branches as a stocking site.Markham and Bolsover Colliery branches and later uses This left coal from Arkwright colliery as the sole traffic on the LD&ECR; west of Langwith Junction. It would go on to have the last laugh over the Great Central main line. Eventually the layout and signalling were greatly simplified. The two single tracks from Duckmanton South Junction to Duckmanton East Junction were lifted between autumn 1963 and February 1965 and the lattice girder flyover was subsequently removed, though it survived at least until June 1965. The track from Duckmanton North Junction to Arkwright East Junction was singled, Duckmanton EastDuckmanton East Signalbox(1) via flickrDuckmanton East Signalbox(2) via flickr and Arkwright TownArkwright Town Signalbox via flickr signalboxes were abolished and the intermediate signalling was removed. Afterlife In September 1966 the GCR Main Line north of Nottingham was closed and severed almost immediately in several places, not least in connection with extending the M1 motorway northwards. At this point the line south-east from Duckmanton North Junction changed from being the branch to the being the sole line. The GC main line tracks south of Duckmanton North Junction were duly lifted and singled to the north, with Class 20 diesels working down from Beighton to Arkwright Colliery, reversing at Arkwright Town Junction and reversing again into the colliery siding. This slow and costly arrangement involved maintaining several miles of track north of Staveley plus two reversals. In 1981 BR addressed this by: *building a brand new connection between the ex-MR Foxlow Junction to Seymour Junction line and the ex-GCR main line through the site of Staveley Central station *relaying the GC main line from Duckmanton North Junction southwards to the bridge over the erstwhile LD&ECR; line, and *removing that bridge and digging out a north to east curve where the lines had previously crossed, thereby giving direct access into Arkwright Colliery yard without any reversals. The relaid section from Duckmanton North Junction southwards as far as the western A632 bridge consisted of a single track with a passing loop, giving the appearance of a double track. The loop ended exactly where Duckmanton South Junction had been. The attached image shows a pair of Class 20s heading northwards at this \\"new Duckmanton South Junction\\" in the 1980s. \\"new Duckmanton South Junction\\" 1980s-style Arkwright Colliery closed in 1988, after which all tracks from Arkwright Colliery to the 1981 junction at Staveley were lifted. Postscript After the colliery closed methane gas was found to be unstoppably seeping into buildings in the village of Arkwright Town. A new village was built on the north side of the A632 and the old village was demolished. The colliery site was opencasted then landscaped. Coal from the opencasting was hauled by road trucks along the trackbed of the GCR Main Line and put onto trains at Oxcroft Disposal Point. This traffic ended c. 2005 when the coal was worked out.Arkwright Town's removal The landscaping has revealed views never available in the 20th Century, notably with the demolition of the substantial LD&ECR; embankment East of Arkwright Town Junction.

The woman, Ella Jones, has been after Ed a long time, but he isn't interested the least to marry her. Ed agrees to try, and writes a love letter to Ella, confessing his love for her. The letter is then delivered by Millie Lou before Joe can give Ed the good news that the bank loan has been approved, and he doesn't have to marry Ella. When Ed tries to explain to Ella that he changed his mind, she is very upset and threatens to sue him. John tells Ed to either pay the money or get the letter, the proof, back. Ed chooses the latter alternative, and that night, he and Joe break into Ella's apartment to steal it back. The attempt results in disaster, and Joe is arrested when he enters the wrong apartment by mistake. A neighbor, Violet Stevens is also arrested, since she was fighting Elmer, her boyfriend, when Joe entered her apartment.

Film Cromwell's 1940 film adaptation for Paramount repeated a story that had already been made by Paramount into film in 1930 by William Wellman, retitled as Dangerous Paradise and, in 1919, was Conrad's first novel to be filmed in a silent version with Lon Chaney Jr.http://www.mrqe.com/movie_reviews/victory-m100062539 Cromwell's version was adapted by John Balderston, who'd written a number of Universal horror pictures, such as Dracula, and the popular The Prisoner of Zenda also directed by Cromwell. Widely considered the best film version, the 1940 film starred Oscar-winning Fredric March, in the steamy tropical psychological thriller, with Betty Field as the female lead (March had begged the recently arrived Ingrid Bergman to do it but she'd refused). Set in the present day, Fredric March's intellectual British recluse has vowed to close himself off from the world and now lives alone on an island in the Dutch East Indies. But the bitter man is forced to break this promise to himself when lovely travelling showgirl Betty Field, also fleeing from the world, is threatened by three murderous scavengers on one dreadful evening. The villains are led by Cedric Hardwicke who stands out as a creepy, soulless villain, as does his Cockney sidekick, Jerome Cowan, whom Hardwicke treats with surprisingly explicit sexual sadism. They switch their attentions from Field to March when they believe that March's character has untold wealth to plunder. The morose March is motivated by love and their savagery to return to the real world and do his part, but his regeneration is tinged by tragedy. Though an uneven movie (it's possible the book was unfilmable, says one review), the 1940 Victory succeeds in its ability to convey Joseph Conrad's overall sense of doom and foreboding. This is doubtless because Cromwell and March, both ardent anti-fascists in favor of then neutral United States joining Britain in the fight against Hitler, were themselves fearing the rise of Nazism in Europe. They refashioned Conrad's 1915 novel into a critique of the perils of isolationism - an issue then rending the US apart as England suffered under the London Blitz from Nazi bombers while the majority of Americans wanted nothing to do with the war. The happy ending tacked on to all three Paramount versions, in which March and Fields spend their lives together in bliss on the island, did not help the film, not least because March and Fields had very little on-screen chemistry in the first place.Fredric March - A Consummate Actor, by Charles Tranberg, Kindle edition, ibid.

The direction is skillful, the acting realistic, and the production values good; but the story is somewhat brutal.\\" Film Daily described it as \\"at all times gripping and exciting\\" and called Fredric March \\"highly effective\\". John Mosher of The New Yorker called the film \\"definitely expert, with a proper allotment of excitement and atmosphere,\\" although he found the later scenes \\"too bald\\" in their simplification of the novel. No one, apparently, noticed its application to the present day.

It replaces the conventional bidet, a separate plumbing fixture not attached to a toilet. Some bidets of this type have one adjustable nozzle on the side rim for anus and genital areas, or two nozzles on the back rim, a shorter \\"family nozzle\\" for washing the area around the anus, and a longer \\"bidet nozzle\\" for women to wash their vulva. Features The essential feature is the nozzle that comes out from underneath the toilet seat and squirts water. It typically has two settings: rear cleaning to wash the anus, and feminine cleaning to wash the vulva, which can be particularly useful during menstruation. Functionality of a bidet which is not a stand- alone fixture: ;Basic non-electronic * A hand-held bidet shower is a nozzle which simply sprays water, either from a piped supply or a container (\\"travel bidet\\"). * A non-electronic toilet-top bidet is a seat for or an attachment to a toilet, with a spray nozzle. The position can usually be adjusted. Most use a single water feed, at the supply temperature (cold or warm); some have hot and cold feed. ;Electronic, basic functionality * A toilet seat connected to a cold water supply and to electricity, with an adjustable nozzle. The device warms the water. The nozzle is typically self-cleaning before and after operation. * The seat is usually heated, reflecting conditions in Japan where electronic bidets are very popular: many homes do not have central heating, and get very cold in winter. * Most electronic bidets blow warm air for drying. * Some form of control panel attached to the side. ;Advanced features not provided by all bidets: * Most electronic bidets support adjustable water, air and seat temperature, adjustable water pressure, and adjustable nozzle position or direction. * Built-in deodorizers and activated carbon filters. * An \\"oscillating mode\\" in which the nozzle moves back and forth, and a \\"pulsating mode\\" which varies jet intensity to help stimulate bowel movement. * A higher pressure mode described as \\"enema mode\\". * Programs such as alternating pulsed hot and cold, prolonged warm action (described sometimes as \\"sitz bath\\"). * Remote control (either wired or wireless). * Energy-saving mode which activates seat heating only if a user sits on the seat. * Automatic opening and closing of the top lid if a user approaches facing backwards, and both lids if facing forwards. * Illumination if a user approaches. * Music (MP3 player). * Disinfection of nozzles with ultraviolet light or treated water. History 1960s: Early years In the early 1960s, the father of Arnold Cohen of Brooklyn, New York, US had a medical condition that caused pain in the rectal area. Arnold designed a toilet seat bidet system, which featured a nozzle that sprayed warm water and blew hot air. In 1964 Arnold patented his design, founded the American Bidet Company, and started marketing the innovative bidet product, dubbed \\"American Sitzbath\\", by using large ads and attending trade shows. It was intended for use at hospitals by patients who had difficulty using toilet paper or reaching around to wipe themselves. Arnold installed thousands of these seats in the suburbs of New York, and the company had offices across the country. Due to cultural barriers, advertising was almost impossible; few wanted to run the ads that the company produced. Following the failure of the product in North America, Cohen licensed his invention and patent to the TOTO company in Japan. In 1967, TOTO imported Arnold's bidet system, now rebranded as 'Wash Air Seat' in Japan. The bidet system failed in Japan as well, because it was too expensive and the bidet function was too foreign for Japanese consumers. 1980s: Introduction of the Washlet In 1980, TOTO introduced the Washlet G, which debuted with three functions: rear cleansing, dryer, and a heated seat. In 1982, the first Washlet television commercial aired, featuring the singer Jun Togawa telling viewers that 'even though it's a bottom, it wants to be washed too'. In another ad, she was shown standing on a fake buttock reading a letter supposedly from her bottom, which writes that 'even bottoms have feelings'. The Wash Air Seat and the early Washlet operated mechanically, and it took several minutes for the spray to start and for the water to heat. These problems were solved by implementing electronic operation. The Washlet's nozzle was made to extend and retract at an angle of 43 degrees, which prevented any used cleansing water from falling back onto the nozzle (\\"backwash\\"). Two TOTO engineers, Mr. Kawakami and Mr. Ito calculated the average location of the human anus with the aid of 300 colleagues who were persuaded to sit on a toilet in private and to mark the positions of their anuses by fixing a small piece of a paper to a wire strung across the seat. The average location of the female vulva was measured in a strip club. In 1987, TOTO launched the first integrated Washlet. From the 1990s: Widespread adoption In 1992, TOTO launched the Neorest, a tank-less toilet with an integrated Washlet. Other manufacturers started producing electronic bidets, without the trademarked term \\"washlet\\". In popular culture Electronic bidets have been featured in the Simpsons and Futurama as \\"Japanese Toilets\\".

The event will mark the centennial of the first World Cup. Host selection The first proposed bid for the 2030 World Cup was by the Royal Moroccan Football Federation after losing to the organisation of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Morocco are possibly planning to co-bid with its eastern neighbours Algeria and Tunisia or its northern neighbours Spain and Portugal. The second was by joint bid from the Argentine Football Association and Uruguayan Football Association. The third was by The Football Association of England. Under FIFA rules as of 2017, the 2030 World Cup cannot be held in Asia (AFC), as its members are excluded from the bidding following the selection of Qatar in 2022, and in North America (CONCACAF), where the 2026 edition in Canada, Mexico and the United States will be hosted. The joint bid by Argentina and Uruguay was announced on 29 July 2017. Before a match between Uruguay and Argentina in Montevideo four weeks later, Uruguay's Luis Su√°rez and Argentina's Lionel Messi ‚Äì teammates at FC Barcelona ‚Äì promoted the bid with commemorative shirts. On 31 August 2017, it was suggested Paraguay would join as a third host. CONMEBOL, the South American confederation, confirmed the joint three-way bid in September 2017. The Uruguay‚ÄìArgentina‚ÄìParaguay bid would coincide with the centennial anniversary of the first FIFA World Cup final hosted by Uruguay as well as the bicentennial of the first Constitution of Uruguay. On 14 February 2019, Chile revealed their plans to join the three confirmed countries in hosting the tournament. Chile was accepted in the bid and will become the first-ever quartet to bid for the World Cup. In 2015, vice-chairman of The Football Association David Gill stated that his country could potentially bid for 2030, provided that the bidding process was made more transparent. Journalist Ben Rumsby wrote, \\"England is one of few countries that could stage even a 48-nation event in its entirety, while Football Association chief executive Martin Glenn made it clear earlier that year bidding for 2030 was an option.\\" In June 2017, UEFA's president Aleksander ƒåeferin stated that Europe (UEFA) would definitely fight for its \\"turn\\" to host the World Cup in 2030. The same month, UEFA stated that \\"it would support a pan-British bid for 2030 or even a single bid from England.\\" The bidding timeline was announced by the FIFA Council at their meeting in Shanghai, China on 24 October 2019: The bidding process is set to be launched in the second quarter of 2022 and the host will be chosen at the 74th FIFA Congress in 2024. Developments in 2018 On 17 June 2018, The Football Association announced that they were in talks with home nations over a UK-wide bid to host 2030 World Cup. On 1 August 2018, it was reported that the FA was preparing a bid for England to host the World Cup in 2030. A decision was expected to be made in 2019, after the FA conducts a feasibility study on a potential bid. UEFA President Aleksander ƒåeferin wants only one European bid to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup. He also considers the British bid as the wisest idea. There are also talks about the Football Association of Ireland joining a possible British bid. The Scottish Football Association considered the potential British bid as a great opportunity to get funds to renovate and redevelop Hampden Park in Glasgow, the Scotland national football team's home stadium. On 19 September 2018, the Football Association of Ireland confirmed it has joined the feasibility study for co-hosting the 2030 World Cup with England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. On 28 September 2018, the then British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the British Government would back any British and Irish FIFA World Cup bid. Furthermore, The Football Association and the Football Association of Wales confirmed that the five national governing bodies were in discussions about the feasibility of bidding to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup. On 17 June 2018, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation announced its co-bidding for the 2030 World Cup. There are two possible joint bids: one with Tunisia and Algeria, and the other with Spain and Portugal. Current FIFA rules block Asian Football Confederation nations from hosting the 2030 World Cup following the selection of Qatar in 2022. Nevertheless, South Korea's President Moon Jae-in suggested in June 2017 that the World Cup be hosted by a Northeast Asian block including both South Korea and North Korea, telling FIFA president Gianni Infantino it would improve relations in the region. Chung Mong-gyu, the head of the Korea Football Association, renewed the offer to the DPR Korea Football Association, the Chinese Football Association and the Japan Football Association at the FIFA Congress in Moscow in June 2018. South Korean president Moon discussed the proposal again with Infantino during the 2018 FIFA World Cup. On 10 July 2018, Egypt's Sports Minister expressed interest in bidding to host. On 15 July 2018, Deputy Leader of the UK Labour Party, Tom Watson, said in an interview that he and his party backed a 2030 World Cup bid for the UK: he said, \\"I hope it's one of the first things a Labour government does, which is work with our FA to try and put a World Cup bid together.\\" On 16 July 2018, the then British Prime Minister Theresa May expressed her support for the bid and her openness about discussions with football authorities. Although there had been no prior discussion with the Football Association, the Scottish FA also expressed an interest in joining a Home Nations bid. Former Scottish First Minister Henry McLeish called on the Scottish government and the Scottish Football Association to bid for the 2030 FIFA World Cup with the other British nations. Cameroonian presidential candidate Joshua Osih's political program includes nominating his country along with two sub-Saharan African countries to host the 2030 World Cup, according to Cameroonian channel CRTV. Interest is thought to be high among many sub-Saharan African countries with the most likely being two from: Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Central African Republic, Nigeria or Angola to join Cameroon in bidding for the 2030 World Cup. On 12 September 2018, Prime Minister of Spain Pedro S√°nchez discussed the possibility of Spain bidding for the 2030 FIFA World Cup with FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Royal Spanish Football Federation President Luis Rubiales. On 29 September 2018, the executive board of the Union of North African Football Federations (UNAF) announced its interest in submitting a joint North African bid for the 2030 FIFA World Cup. On 2 November 2018, the leaders of Bulgaria, Greece, Romania and Serbia confirmed their intention to compete to host the tournament considering a combined bid. Developments in 2019 On 25 February 2019, at a meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria it was officially confirmed that Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece would submit joint candidacy for the organisation of the UEFA Euro 2028 and 2030 FIFA World Cup. Following a meeting, the ministers signed a memorandum of understanding on 10 April 2019 in Thessaloniki, Greece. On 5 June 2019, FIFA President Gianni Infantino referred to the FIFA Council meeting in October 2019 when he was asked for an update on the rules and timeline for the bidding process adding \\"We'll also see if there can be a bid from China\\". On 8 June 2019, Spain and Portugal expressed an interest about co-hosting the 2030 FIFA World Cup. In July 2019, Egyptian Football Association president Hany Abo Rida said Egypt would be ready to host a 48-team World Cup. On 7 September 2019, President of Ecuador Len√≠n Moreno proposed a joint bid for organising the 2030 FIFA World Cup alongside Colombia and Peru. The answer from both countries was yet to be decided. On 14 September 2019, President of Colombia Ivan Duque confirmed Colombia would bid to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup along with Ecuador and Peru. He also claimed President of Peru Martin Vizcarra said the 2030 FIFA World Cup was important.

M√ºller is a German dentist and European pioneer of modern dental implantology. He grew up in Sinn in Hesse, Germany, where he was born on July 20, 1949. Biography After studying natural science at the G√∂ttingen University and the Heidelberg University Klaus F. M√ºller approbated in 1976 and promovated in 1977 at the Giessen University (Centre for dermatology and andrology).K. M√ºller: Zur Therapie der Flu√üs√§ure-Ver√§tzung anhand eines neuen Tierexperimentellen Modells unter besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung allgemeiner und methodischer Probleme. Inaug. Diss., Gie√üen 1976. Vorhanden in: UB Giessen, Signatur 40.292.84, Magazin Privately, he is concerned with the art and architecture of historicism (art) Klaus F. M√ºller: Park und Villa Haas - Historismus Kunst und Lebensstil. ISBN (E-Book): 978-3-86468-765-5 and he is an avid ultralight pilot. He is married and has two adult children. Dental implantology In 1976 he became a member of the first German Academy of Implantology (DAIOS) in Bremen and cofounder of the Society of European Implantology in Hamburg. In 1978 and 1980 he published the then acclaimed first German manuals on all methods of oral implantologyK. M√ºller: Kleines Handbuch zur oralen Implantologie, 1978, K. M√ºller: Die Quintessenz der oralen Implantologie, 1980, (at that time against resistance of the universities). Klaus F. M√ºller produced numerous instructional films on various implant systems and their prosthetic restoration from 1976-1982, to increase his scientific reputation as a practitioner dentist. He showed the films at international conferences for implantology. The partial underlay of the films with music and in some parts the bloody surgical representation was initially highly debated as it was a noventum for that time. In the early years, it was hence seen as a violation of medical ethical principles. In the transition from the elaborate narrow-film technology (Super 8, Super 16) to the video presentation (VHS, U-matic), Klaus F. M√ºller was a pioneer in this field. Cutting, sound recording, camera tracking and lighting has become easier with smaller, lighter devices. In addition to further training courses, contributed in particular the boost in innovation and the associated focus on moving images significantly to the spread of new dental implantological techniques in Europe. Especially the non-written sources from the early days of oral implantology are threatened with decay. Digitalization of historical operation films has been initiated to save this archive (see, for example, Category: Klaus F. M√ºller Wikimedia Commons) M√ºller's friendship with the American engineer Thomas D. Driskell (Bicon) led to a number of publications and further education films about Synthodont, Titanodont, Titanaloy and Synthograft K. M√ºller: Titanaloy, Synthodont, Titanodont. Technik und Modifikation eines amerikanischen Implantationssystems Dental Revue 12/1984, S. 9-16 (Vogt-Schild Druck Verlag, CH-4501 Solothurn) (products of Miter company) from 1982 till 1985. His main income was the modification of American dental implant systems on European standards. Some of these innovations were inside chilled drills, bone management, special mucosal punches for minimal invasive operations or plastic splinting with UV light hardening. His cooperation with Dutch dental implantologists (CMFI - college for Maxillofaciale Implantology) around Bruggenkate and Oosterbeek started 1983‚Äì84 on a dental congress in Davos and resulted in cooperated publications.C.M. Ten Bruggenkate: I.T.I. Hollow Cylinder Implant ‚Äì Clinical and Radiological Aspects of Oral Implants, with Special Emphasis on the I.T.I Hollow Cylinder Implant, Chapter 6 + 7 , Page 75-83 + 85-100,, 1990 In 1989, M√ºller became the cofounder of BDIZ/EDI (European Association of Dental Implantologists) and was in different leading positions till 2004. M√ºller has published over 100 articles related to oral medicine, such as bone management, narrow jaw implants,http://www.drklausmueller.de/plugins/files/922680/narrow_jaw_implants.pdf taxes for medical products, fracture testing, new implant systems, quality management, dental ethics etc.http://www.drklausmueller.de/fachzeitschriften.html His aviation-borrowed keyword ‚ÄúKeep it safe and simple‚Äù runs through all his lectures and publications. In opposition to oral surgeons, Mueller always supported dental specialization and master's courses for implantology. In Germany since 2002 \\"T√§tigkeitsschwerpunkt Implantologie\\" (minimum 200 implants in five years) is a recognized additional title for dentists. During M√ºller's tenure as chairman of the committee for register and qualification at BDIZ/EDI (1993‚Äì2003), he established criteria and standards for the dental implantology in cooperation with P. Ehrl and Helmut B. Engels.P. Ehrl, H.B.Engels, K.

The story was conceived by Alison Deegan who co-wrote the screenplay along with Rickman and Jeremy Brock. The film stars Kate Winslet, Matthias Schoenaerts, Alan Rickman, Stanley Tucci, Helen McCrory, Steven Waddington, Jennifer Ehle and Rupert Penry-Jones. The film was financed by Lionsgate UK and produced by BBC Films. It was the second film directed by Rickman, after his 1997 directorial debut The Winter Guest. It was the second collaboration of Rickman and Winslet after their 1995 film Sense and Sensibility. Production took place in London in mid-2013. The film had its world premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival as the closing night film on 13 September 2014. Plot King Louis XIV of France assigns the design and construction of the Gardens of Versailles to landscape architect Andr√© Le N√¥tre. Le N√¥tre interviews several other garden designers who have submitted designs for the project, including one woman, Sabine de Barra. He sees her move a potted plant in his garden prior to her interview, and asks her if she gives deference to order in design. Sabine affirms her respect for his work but suggests that she would like to create something uniquely French rather than follow classical and renaissance styles. He shows her the door, and she leaves disheartened. Bosquet de la Salle-de-Bal at Gardens of Versailles, laid out by Andr√© Le N√¥tre between 1680 and 1683. After all the interviews, Andr√© mulls over the candidates, oppressed by the weight of the king's expectations. A few judicious words from his assistant prompt him to reconsider Sabine's designs. Later that evening, Andr√© surprises Sabine at her home and, after examining her seemingly untamed but magical home garden, tasks her with responsibility for an outdoor ballroom at Versailles, surrounded by fountains and landscaping. Andr√©'s plans had called for a constant supply of water from a distance at great expense, but Sabine devises another engineering solution: a reservoir from which water can be continuously recycled through the fountains. As work begins on her design, Sabine initially makes little progress with the workmen recommended by one of the designers rejected by Andr√©. Another competitor and an acquaintance of hers, Thierry Duras, intervenes and offers the use of his crew. As a striking commoner, artlessly beautiful and fearlessly honest, Sabine attracts attention at court, and is befriended by the King's brother Duc Philippe d'Orleans and his wife Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine. At times, Sabine appears haunted by recurring images of wagon wheels in movement and brief glimpses of a young girl or the girl's voice. Sabine and Andr√© become increasingly attracted to each other but do not act on their feelings. Andr√© quietly endures the infidelities of his wife Fran√ßoise, who insists that her husband's success is founded on her influence at court. When Fran√ßoise senses his interest in Sabine and warns him against an affair, he quotes her own speech declaring their right to seek comfort elsewhere, and becomes resolute in his intention to pursue a relationship with Sabine. Queen Maria Theresa dies suddenly. The king is stunned at the loss of his wife and takes refuge in one of his gardener's work areas, among his prized pear trees. Sabine finds the king there as she delivers perennials for a trade, initially mistaking him for the gardener. The king enjoys her warmth and forthrightness, and after she recognizes him she agrees to continue their conversation as equals. He invites her to travel with him and his court to the Palace of Fontainebleau. At the Versailles garden site, Sabine is visited by Fran√ßoise, who tells her that Andr√©'s interest in her is only a whim and will prove short-lived. After they both have left the site, Fran√ßoise's lover opens the sluice gates from the reservoir in the middle of a powerful storm and floods the work site, destroying much of the earthworks. Sabine nearly drowns trying to close the gate, and Andr√© helps pull her from the gushing water. The next morning, Sabine works vigorously to mend some of the damage done by the storm and flood. That same day, Louis XIV visits Sabine's work site and assesses the project skeptically but allows it to proceed. Afterwards, Andr√© finds a glove at the worksite that he knows belongs to his wife Fran√ßoise. He realizes she is behind the sabotage of the project, confronts her with the glove, and ends their relationship. Sabine goes to court again, where Duc de Lauzun introduces her to the king's mistress, the Marquise de Montespan, who in turn introduces her to the women of the court. At first they tease her, but when they learn that Sabine is widowed and also lost her 6-year-old daughter, they reveal their own losses and welcome her into their circle, where they often discuss topics the king forbids at court. The Marquise formally presents Sabine to the king when he arrives, and Sabine offers him a four-seasons rose ‚Äî the same kind found in the garden where they first met. They converse about the nature of the rose and its life cycle, beauty, hardships, and death, and the gardener's responsibilities -- all of it Sabine's veiled defense of Madame de Montespan, who has begun to lose the king's favor. Again, the king is charmed and touched by her observations. Andr√© waits for Sabine outside her room that night, and they finally make love. In the morning, Andr√© finds himself alone in bed. Sabine is upstairs, lost in the memory of the day her daughter and husband died: he was taking their daughter with him on a day trip. Prior to leaving, he reveals to Sabine that he has a mistress. He then rounds up their daughter and gets into the carriage. As they are leaving, Sabine sees that the carriage has a faulty wheel and learns from the footman that her husband is taking their daughter to his mistress's home ‚Äî not on a business trip as he had indicated. She races after the carriage, and when she tries to block the carriage in the road, it veers off track and topples down a steep hill, killing both father and daughter. Andr√© finds Sabine in the grip of this memory, evoked by her conversation with the ladies of the court and her intense night with him, and he convinces her to stop blaming herself for their deaths. When Sabine's project is complete, the king and his court arrive for its inauguration. To the music of a hidden orchestra, everyone begins dancing as the fountains send water coursing down the tiers around the ballroom floor. After Sabine dances with the king, she and Andr√© leave the others and walk into the garden together. Cast * Kate Winslet as Sabine De Barra * Matthias Schoenaerts as Andr√© Le N√¥tre * Alan Rickman as King Louis XIV * Stanley Tucci as Duke Philippe, Duc d'Orleans * Helen McCrory as Madame Le N√¥tre * Steven Waddington as Thierry Duras * Jennifer Ehle as Madame De Montespan * Rupert Penry-Jones as Antoine Lauzun * Paula Paul as Princess Palatine * Danny Webb as Claude Moulin * Phyllida Law as Suzanne Production The story was conceived by Allison Deegan, who co-wrote the screenplay along with Rickman and Jeremy Brock. The film was financed by the Lionsgate UK and produced by BBC Films. Production began in March 2013. Producer Zygi Kamasa of Lionsgate said that \\"we are delighted to be working with the best of British actors and directors like Kate Winslet and Alan Rickman as we move forward in doubling our investment in British films in 2014.\\" Rickman said: \\"The film is not just frills at the wrists and collars. It's about people getting their hands dirty and building something in order to entertain the other world they serve. It's about how one world maintains the other, often at the cost of women.\\" Casting Landscape scenes were shot at Blenheim Palace. On 17 January 2013, it was announced that Kate Winslet and Matthias Schoenaerts had been cast as the leads in the film. Rickman had Winslet in mind for the lead role of Sabine de Barra and continued with her when two weeks into shooting, Winslet announced that she was pregnant. In addition to directing, Rickman took the role of King Louis XIV. He explained that \\"the only way I could do it was because in a way, he's like a director, Louis, so you kind of keep the same expression on your face. As a director, you see everything somehow. It's like a huge all-encompassing eye that sees everything, and it's able to cherry pick; ‚ÄòMove that,‚Äô ‚ÄòDon't do that,‚Äô ‚ÄòDo it this way,‚Äô ‚ÄòChange this colour.‚Äô And I don't know where that comes from, but it does, once you're given the job, and I have a feeling Louis probably would've been a great film director.\\" Filming Despite being set in France, complete filming took place in England. Principal photography commenced on 27 March 2013 and continued over eight weeks in Black Park, Cliveden House, Pinewood Studios, Blenheim Palace, Waddesdon Manor, Hampton Court Palace, Ham House, Ashridge and Chenies Manor. Filming ended on 8 June 2013 in Richmond, London. According to Rickman, filming \\"wasn't easy, though; throwing Kate into freezing water at 1 a.m., the carriage crash, scenes with 80 extras, tight schedules in venues like Blenheim Palace. It's a constant tap dance between control and freedom and of course the budget guides everything.\\" Music The soundtrack was composed by Peter Gregson. It was the first feature film for Gregson, who previously composed music for a 2014 short film Every Quiet Moment. Veigar Margeirsson's 2008 composition \\"Rise above\\" was used in the trailer of the film but was not part of soundtrack album, which was released by Milan Records on 16 April 2015. Soundtrack listing Distribution Promotion BBC Films revealed footage from the film as part of their BBC Films Sizzle Showreel 2013 on 25 November 2013. First stills of Kate Winslet were released on 22 July 2014 with the announcement of film's premiere at 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. Three images from the film featuring Winslet, Alan Rickman and Jennifer Ehle were released on 27 August 2014. A scene from the film featuring Winslet and Rickman was revealed on 9 September 2014. The full-length official trailer was revealed on 19 December 2014. The first poster and another trailer were released on 20 January 2015. On 11 June 2015, another scene from the film featuring Stanley Tucci was released. Release The film had its world premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival as the closing night film on 13 September 2014. It was then shown in gala screenings as Love Gala at the 2014 BFI London Film Festival on 17 October 2014. Rickman presented the film at Camerimage film festival in November 2014. The United States premiere was held at the Sonoma International Film Festival on 25 March 2015. It had a theatrical release in Australia on 26 March 2015 and in UK on 17 April 2015. It was initially set for a theatrical release on 27 March 2015 in the United States but it was later pulled out. Focus Features finally gave the film a theatrical and VOD release simultaneously in United States on 26 June 2015. Reception Box office As of July 2015, the film has been opened in fourteen territories including Australia and UK and had grossed $10,084,623 worldwide. Critical response Winslet and Rickman at the screening of the film at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. The film generated mixed reviews from critics, with the performances from the cast being highly praised. , the film holds a 48% approval rating on review aggregator, Rotten Tomatoes, based on 92 reviews with an average score of 5.41/10. The site's consensus states that \\"Stylish and well-acted without ever living up to its dramatic potential, A Little Chaos is shouldered by the impressive efforts of a talented cast.\\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film holds an average score of 51, based on 21 reviews, which indicates \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Catherine Shoard of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars and wrote that \\"Winslet manages emotional honesty within anachronistic confines, and Schoenaerts escapes with dignity.\\" Mark Adams in his review for Screen International said, \\"the film is a gracefully made delight, replete with lush costumes, fruity performances, love amongst the flowerbeds and even a little mild peril. Yes it lacks real dramatic edge and may be seen as a typical British period costume film, but it is also a classily made pleasure that will delight its target audience.\\" David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter felt that \\"This decently acted film is agreeable entertainment, even if it works better on a scene by scene basis than in terms of overall flow.\\" Tim Robey in The Telegraph said in his review: \\"If you see only one film about 17th-century French landscape gardening this year, it probably ought to be A Little Chaos, a heaving bouquet of a picture.\\" However, David Sexton of the London Evening Standard gave the film a negative review, saying that \\"Kate Winslet charms as a gardener at the Court of Louis XIV, but it's not enough to keep this inauthentic piece from wilting.\\" Dennis Harvey of Variety also criticized the film, writing that A Little Chaos is \\"all too tidy as it imposes a predictable, pat modern sensibility on a most unconvincing depiction of late 17th-century French aristocratic life.\\" Kaleem Aftab of The Independent gave the film two out of five stars, noting that while the performances were exceptional, the talents of the players were wasted. He wrote that \\"it all starts off so promisingly\\" and praised the camera work and language, but found it quickly fails as \\"a melancholic look at grief\\" where \\"at least four different genres [clash] against each other, occasionally in the same scene\\" and \\"the romance seems to take place off- screen.\\" She concluded: \\"There was a 17-year gap between Rickman's first and second film and on this evidence it's easy to see why. While he can get performances out of the actors, he lacks command of pacing and plot.\\" Historical accuracy Some of the film's characters are fictional, including Kate Winslet's Sabine de Barra. The film is set in 1682, but Andr√© Le N√¥tre began work at Versailles in 1661. Le N√¥tre was nearly 70 in 1682, twice the age he appears to be as portrayed by Schoenaerts in the film. A garden much like that in the film exists at Versailles, the Salle de Bal or Bosquet de la Salle-de-Bal (the Forest Ballroom).

The show was produced by Trinity Productions at the Trinity TV Studios at Trinity Church at the corner of Broadway and Wall Street in New York City. Gameplay Three players competed daily. Round one In round one, host Lee asked the contestants trivia questions on subjects and areas ranging from Bible trivia to art and zoology. The first player to buzz in with the correct answer earned 10 points and a chance at a bonus question on the same subject for an additional 10 points. Round two Round two was played the same way as round one, but with point values doubled, meaning that questions were worth 20 points. Round three In round three, all correct answers to questions were worth 30 points. The first letter of each answer was a letter in that day's \\"Inspiration Word\\" (the number of letters varied per episode). Giving correct answers allowed players to solve the word. Solving the word scored an additional 100 points and ended the game.

Each ossicle is composed of microcrystals of calcite arranged in a three-dimensional lattice known as a stereom. Under polarized light the ossicle behaves as if it were a single crystal because the axes of all the crystals are parallel. The space between the crystals is known as the stroma and allows entry to sclerocytes for enlargement and repair. The honeycomb structure is light but tough and collagenous ligaments connect the ossicles together. The ossicles are embedded in a tough connective tissue which is also part of the endoskeleton. When an ossicle becomes redundant, specialised cells known as phagocytes are able to reabsorb the calcareous material.Ruppert et al, 2004. pp. 876‚Äì878 All the ossicles, even those that protrude from the body wall, are covered by a thin layer of epidermis but functionally they act more like an exoskeleton than an endoskeleton. Types of ossicle Sea urchin tests showing the ball parts of the ball and socket joints that articulate with the spines Iconaster longimanus, the icon seastar, showing plate ossicles Ossicles have a variety of forms including flat plates, spines, rods and crosses, and specialised compound structures including pedicellariae and paxillae. Plates are tabular ossicles that fit neatly together in a tessellated manner. They form the main skeletal covering for sea urchins and sea stars. Spines are ossicles that project from the body wall and articulate with other ossicles through ball and socket joints mounted on tubercles.Ruppert et al, 2004. pp. 897‚Äì898 They are formed from crystals of calcite and can be solid or hollow, long or short, thick or thin and sharp or blunt. The spines serve a protective function and are also used for locomotion. Pedicellariae are compound ossicles that articulate with other ossicles and protrude from the aboral (upper) surface of some sea stars (and also the test of sea urchins). They usually have short fleshy stalks and either two or three moveable ossicles forming a set of pincer-like jaws. They may be scattered over the surface or may be grouped around spines. Their function is to pick off debris so as to keep the surface clean and to prevent larvae of other invertebrates from settling and growing there. Paxillae are small pillar-shaped ossicles with flat tops sometimes found covering the aboral surface of sea stars such as Luidia, Astropecten and Goniaster that live underneath sediment. Their stalks emerge from the body wall and their tops, each fringed with short spines, and abut each other to form a protective external false skin. Beneath this is a water-filled cavity which contains the madreporite and delicate gill structures known as papillae. Arrangement Sea urchins are covered with plates which are usually fused together to give a rigid test, but in the order Echinothurioida, the test is leathery because the plates are separate. The test is divided into five segments that extend from the apex to the mouth. Each contains two ambulacral rows of plates alternating with two interambulacral rows. The ambulacral plates are each pierced by a pair of pores through which the active tube feet are connected to the water vascular system. Ossicles in the form of spines connect to tubercles on some of the plates. Sea urchins have several types of pedicellariae, some of which are toxic. A ring of specialised plates surround the aboral pole consisting of five genital plates, one of which is the madreporite, and five smaller ocular plates. Other large specialist plates surround the mouth in a set of jaws known as Aristotle's lantern.Ruppert et al, 2004. pp. 897‚Äì898 Sea stars have separate plates giving flexibility to the disc and arms. They are arranged into interambulacral and ambulacral regions and the arms have an ambulacral groove on the underside from which the tube feet project. Other ossicles that may be present include pedicellariae and paxillae. There is often a large row of marginal plates adjoining the ambulacral groove, sometimes bearing spines. Brittle stars do not have pedicellariae, and the plates that cover their surface are known as shields. On the arms these are in four rows with each segment having an aboral and oral shield and two lateral shields, usually with fringing spines. Other ossicles include spines, tubercles, small scales and vertebrae. The large central vertebrae in each arm segment provides the articulating element that joins it to the next.Ruppert et al, 2004. p. 890 Crinoid fossils from the Jurassic showing ossicles Several types of small ossicles are found in the body wall of sea cucumbers. Baskets are cup-shaped and usually have four projections. Buttons are disc-shaped and pierced by four holes and may be smooth or knobbed. Perforated plates are sieve-like and often widely distributed and rods provide support for the tube feet and tentacles. In the order Apodida, members of which lack tube feet, there are anchor-shaped ossicles attached to anchor plates. The flukes project from the body wall and provide traction.Ruppert et al, 2004. p. 910 Crinoids are supported by jointed stalks containing substantial compound ossicles. The crown has ossicles scattered throughout the connective tissue (crinoids have no distinct dermis). The arms contain columns of well-developed vertebrae-like ossicles. Each joint has limited movement but the whole arm can be coiled and uncoiled.Ruppert et al, 2004. p. 917 References Bibliography * Category:Echinoderm anatomy ","title":"Ossicle (echinoderm)"},{"id":"39367366","text":"The Church of Saint Charles Borromeo and Our Lady of the Assumption () is a Roman Catholic parish church in the neighbourhood of Prado, Montevideo, Uruguay.

It became the only historic site in Brown County, Nebraska to be listed on the National Register. It was deemed significant \\"on a regional level...for its association with the commercial development of Long Pine and with the building boom of second generation hotels that occurred on a statewide basis during the first quarter of the twentieth century\\" and on a statewide level \\"as an extraordinarily well preserved relict example of the Longitudinal Block hotel\\". The Miller Hotel was not, however, typical of the \\"modern\\" hotels of its era, in that it was not built from brick, was created by the expansion and conversion of a single-family dwelling, and lacked modern features such as private telephones and hot and cold water in its individual rooms. It includes Queen Anne style architecture in the United States and has also been known as Luerhs Rooming House and BW04-001. and It was bought in 1984 by a local historical society, the Long Pine Heritage Society, which intended to preserve the building and open it as a local history museum.
