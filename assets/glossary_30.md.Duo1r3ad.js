Produced by the Nadiadwalas, the film is directed by Raja Nawathe. It stars Manoj Kumar, Waheeda Rehman, Mumtaz, Pran, Mehmood, Lalita Pawar and Aruna Irani.

The film stood 9th in the Box-Office Top Ten List of 1967. Plot The story revolves around two friends, Meena (Mumtaz) and Taruna (Waheeda Rehman). Meena lives a wealthy lifestyle along with her widowed dad, Thakur, in a small town in India. Taruna is her assistant as well as her best friend. Meena, while coming to her village from town, meets Rajesh (Manoj Kumar), who teases her. When Meena's dad hires a new manager, she comes to know that he is the same person she met on the train. She, along with Taruna, try to tease Rajesh by pretending to be in love with him. He finds out and pretends that he has fallen in love with both. As a result, both women end up falling in love with him for real, and Thakur is ready to permit Meena to wed him. Meena makes it clear that she wants Rajesh for herself and reminds Taruna that she had been engaged to their manager, Lala Bhagatram (Pran), when Taruna was a child. Lala Bhagatram is a very nasty man, who keeps reminding Taruna in public that he will marry as per the childhood promise. Then Rajesh is assaulted by some men and his mother, Shanti, (Lalita Pawar) looks after him. When Thakur sees her, he remembers that he had murdered her husband for all the wealth. Shanti hassles with a secret, that Meena is actually her daughter and Rajesh is Thakur's son. She wants them to get married so that she can be the owner of all the wealth again. Shanti begs Taruna to go away from Rajesh or else her plan will fail. Taruna agrees and pretends she doesn't love Rajesh. But Rajesh only loves Taruna and is emotionally hurt. Taruna can't take this anymore and decides to kill herself. Haria (Mehmood)- a childish mentally challenged person reveals that she is not dead, but Lala Bhagatram has kept her in captivity. Rajesh goes and fights all the goons including Lala Bhagatram, but is beaten by them. Gauri (Aruna Irani) and Taruna are transferred somewhere else with someone watching them constantly. Gauri's tied hands are freed by Taruna by cleverly avoiding the watchful eyes of the goons. Gauri jumps from the window and informs Rajesh. Rajesh goes and frees Taruna. In this fighting, Meena dies, Lala Bhagatram is killed by Thakur and Thakur is taken in custody. Shanti wants to leave, but Rajesh and Taruna insist that she stay with them. Haria and Gauri marry as well.

The film is set in Nazi Germany during World War II and depicts the 20 July plot in 1944 by German army officers to assassinate Adolf Hitler and to use the Operation Valkyrie national emergency plan to take control of the country. The film was released by American studio United Artists and stars Tom Cruise as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, one of the key plotters. The cast includes Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Eddie Izzard, Terence Stamp, and Tom Wilkinson. Cruise's casting caused controversy among German politicians and members of the von Stauffenberg family due to the actor's practice of Scientology, which is viewed with suspicion in Germany. Because of this, the filmmakers initially had difficulty setting up filming locations in Germany, but they were later given access to locations such as Berlin's historic Bendlerblock. German newspapers and filmmakers supported the film and its intention to spread global awareness of von Stauffenberg's plot. The film changed release dates several times, from as early as June 27, 2008, to as late as February 14, 2009. The changing calendar and poor response to United Artists's initial marketing campaign drew criticism about the film's viability. After a positive test screening, Valkyries release in North America was ultimately changed to December 25, 2008. United Artists renewed its marketing campaign to reduce its focus on Cruise and to highlight Singer's credentials. The film received mixed reviews in the United States and in Germany, where it opened commercially on January 22, 2009. Plot During World War II, Wehrmacht Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg is stationed in Tunisia, where he becomes increasingly disillusioned with the future of Germany under Hitler's tyranny. His battalion comes under attack by P-40 fighter-bombers of the No. 3 Squadron RAAF, Desert Air Force.3 Sqn veteran Tom Russell states that: \\"operational records and pilot diaries\\" for the other Desert Air Force Kittyhawk squadrons \\"shows them operating away from Mezzouna...\\" at the time. Tom Russell, 2011, \\"3 Squadron and the 'Plot to Kill Hitler'\\" (Access: 23 April 2012.) Russell Stauffenberg is severely injured in the air raid and is evacuated home to Nazi Germany. Meanwhile, Hitler visits his military headquarters on the Eastern Front. General Henning von Tresckow attempts to assassinate Hitler by smuggling a timebomb disguised as a box of Cointreau onto his plane. The bomb fails to detonate, and Hitler's plane lands safely in Berlin. Shortly afterwards resistance member General Hans Oster is arrested by the Gestapo. While recuperating, Stauffenberg is recruited by General Friedrich Olbricht to take Oster's place in the German Resistance, which includes Tresckow, General Ludwig Beck, Dr. Carl Goerdeler, and Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben. Stauffenberg proposes using Operation Valkyrie, which involves the deployment of the Reserve Army in a national emergency, as a means to take control of the country. The plotters redraft the plan's orders to dismantle the Nazi regime after assassinating Hitler. Stauffenberg's new role within the Reserve Army grants him direct access to Hitler, who approves the redrafted plan without fully examining the modifications. Realizing that only General Friedrich Fromm, the head of the Reserve Army, can initiate Valkyrie, they offer him a position as head of the Wehrmacht, but Fromm declines to be directly involved. Stauffenberg is ordered to assassinate both Hitler and Himmler at the Wolf's Lair. He persuades General Fellgiebel to cut off communications after the attempt. On July 15, 1944, Stauffenberg attends a strategy meeting at the Wolf's Lair with a bomb, but does not receive permission to proceed as Himmler is absent. Meanwhile, the Reserve Army is mobilized by Olbricht. Stauffenberg leaves with the bomb and the Reserve Army is ordered to stand down. Fromm threatens Olbricht and Stauffenberg that he will arrest them if they try to control the Reserve Army again; Stauffenberg berates the plotters for their indecisiveness and condemns Goerdeler. When Goerdeler demands that Stauffenberg be relieved, Beck informs him that the SS has issued a warrant for his arrest, and that he must leave the country immediately. On July 20, 1944, Stauffenberg and his adjutant Lieutenant Haeften return to the Wolf's Lair. Due to the warm weather, the conference is being held in an open-window summer barrack, minimizing their bomb's potential effectiveness. Stauffenberg places the briefcase containing the bomb close to Hitler before leaving. Officer Heinz Brandt moves the case behind a table leg, inadvertently shielding Hitler. When the bomb explodes, Stauffenberg is certain that Hitler is dead and flees, managing to bluff his way past security checkpoints and returning to Berlin. Olbricht refuses to mobilize the Reserve Army without confirmation that Hitler is dead ‚Äì Colonel Von Quirnheim (one of the plotters) forges his signature and issues the orders. With Valkyrie underway, the plotters order the arrest of Nazi party leaders and SS officers, convincing lower officers that the Party and the SS are staging a coup, and soldiers begin to take control of the ministries. Rumors surface that Hitler survived the blast, but Stauffenberg dismisses them as SS propaganda. Having learned from Field Marshal Keitel that Hitler is still alive, Fromm refuses to join the plotters, resulting in them detaining him. Major Otto Ernst Remer of the Reserve Army prepares to arrest Goebbels, but is stopped when Goebbels connects him by phone to Hitler. Recognizing the voice on the other end, Remer realizes that the Reserve Army has been duped. SS officers are released and the plotters are besieged inside the Bendlerblock. The headquarters staff flees, but the resistance leaders are arrested. Attempting to save himself, Fromm convenes an impromptu court martial, places Beck under arrest, and sentences Von Quirnheim, Olbricht, Haeften, and Stauffenberg to death. The ringleaders are executed by firing squad, Beck and Tresckow commit suicide, Witzleben and Goerdeler are sentenced by Roland Freisler in show trials and hanged. A post-script displays the text of the German resistance memorial. Cast German World War II Colonel Von Stauffenberg (left) and actor Tom Cruise (right). Cruise was attracted to the role based on the resemblance of his profile to the colonel's. * Tom Cruise as Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, the German army Colonel who was instrumental in the conspiracy to assassinate Adolf Hitler: Bryan Singer saw von Stauffenberg as \\"very much a humanist\\", saying, \\"He understood his role as a colonel, but he also understood that the Nazis were doing terrible, terrible, terrible things.\\" Having directed Superman Returns, Singer compared von Stauffenberg's dual identity as loyal colonel and conspirator to Superman and his civilian identity Clark Kent. Cruise had wanted to work with Singer since they met at the premiere for Mission: Impossible, and the actor was enticed by the script's background, the truth of which struck him as a surprise. The actor described von Stauffenberg's heroism: \\"I thought of it in terms of what [von] Stauffenberg represents. He was someone who realized that he had to take the steps that ultimately cost him his life. ... He recognized what was at stake.\\" Cruise felt von Stauffenberg did not think of himself as a hero. The actor prepared for the role for eight months by hiring a researcher, studying history books, and speaking with some of von Stauffenberg's family. Since von Stauffenberg lost his left eye, right hand and two fingers on his left hand in an Allied attack in Tunisia, Cruise affected the same disabilities to practice dressing, moving items and writing. Cruise initially found the eyepatch difficult to work with but acknowledged that von Stauffenberg had to live with this discomfort. * Kenneth Branagh as Major General Henning von Tresckow: Branagh differed physically from the real von Tresckow, who was balding, but Singer said, \\"[I]f you look at [von] Tresckow's energy, he had an honesty that Branagh has.\\" * Bill Nighy as General of Infantry Friedrich Olbricht: Nighy was cast to give a sympathetic quality, so Olbricht would not be the \\"fall guy\\". Nighy wanted to convey Olbricht as conflicted between complaining about Hitler's regime and actually doing something about it. The actor described his portrayal, \\"One of the most disconcerting things imaginable is to put on a Nazi uniform. It's so associated with evil that it took me several days to get used to being in costume.\\" * Terence Stamp as General Ludwig Beck: Singer met Stamp to discuss playing a part in X-Men, having admired him for portraying General Zod in Superman II. Stamp endured the Blitz as a child and aided Singer in staging a scene where the von Stauffenbergs hide from Allied bombings. The actor described his approach to acting: he was not the sort of actor who puts on a mask; rather, he tries to find the place within himself that resonates with the characters he portrays saying that \\"[t]here has to be a kind of non-judgmental discernment, so when I'm playing villains, they don't think they're particularly villains.\\" Singer said of his direction of Stamp as the heroic and selfless Beck that he sought to find \\"the part of Terence that would be prepared to fall on his sword for certain ideals\\" just as Beck had in fact done after being arrested with his co-conspirators for treason. * Tom Wilkinson as General Friedrich Fromm, the head of Germany's Reserve Army: Wilkinson was cast to make the treacherous Fromm sympathetic. * Carice van Houten as Nina Schenk Gr√§fin von Stauffenberg, von Stauffenberg's wife: The filmmakers were impressed by her performance in Black Book, and argued she could give a strong performance with minimal dialogue. Screenwriter Nathan Alexander spoke to von Stauffenberg's relatives and noted that, although Nina and Claus never directly spoke about the plot, \\"in a sense it was all they talked about\\". * Kevin McNally as Dr. Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, a German politician who intends to become chancellor of Germany after a successful coup * David Schofield as Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben, a retired general and one of the plotters: Singer and producer Christopher McQuarrie were impressed by Schofield's professionalism and dedication to show up on set for scenes without his character, and the filmmakers expanded his role as a result.Valkyrie DVD commentary featuring Bryan Singer and Christopher McQuarrie, [2009], United Artists. * Christian Berkel as Colonel Albrecht Ritter Mertz von Quirnheim, a plotter with knowledge of explosives * Jamie Parker as Lieutenant Werner von Haeften, an adjutant to von Stauffenberg who helps the colonel carry out the plot * Eddie Izzard as General of Signal Corps Erich Fellgiebel, a German signals officer and plotter, responsible for communications at Hitler's bunker Wolf's Lair * David Bamber as Adolf Hitler, the F√ºhrer of Germany: During Bamber's audition for the role, Singer was struck by Bamber's eyes and stated that Bamber had a quality that resonated with Hitler. * Thomas Kretschmann as Major Otto Ernst Remer, commanding officer of Gro√üdeutschland guard battalion: Kretschmann was the original choice to play von Stauffenberg before Singer joined the production, when McQuarrie was intending to direct. * Harvey Friedman as Dr. Joseph Goebbels, Minister of Propaganda and a member of Hitler's inner circle * Kenneth Cranham as Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, the head of the OKW and a member of Hitler's inner circle * Matthias Freihof as Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS and a member of Hitler's inner circle * Waldemar Kobus as Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf, chief of the Berlin police who pledges his and men's assistance in carrying out the plot * Halina Reijn as Margarethe von Oven, secretary in the Bendlerblock: Reijn co-starred with fellow Dutchwoman Carice van Houten in Black Book. * Werner Daehn as Major Ernst John von Freyend * Tom Hollander as Colonel Heinz Brandt * Bernard Hill as a general working with von Stauffenberg during the Tunisian campaign: While he is not named in the film, the 10th Panzer Division's commander while von Stauffenberg was serving with it was General Wolfgang Fischer. * Ian McNeice as the composite \\"Pompous General\\" who attempts to disrupt the coup headquarters: Though the general is not named in the film, McQuarrie and Alexander said the character was based on General Joachim von Kortzfleisch, who tried to disrupt the coup in the same fashion. * Gerhard Haase-Hindenberg as Hermann G√∂ring * Anton Algrang as Albert Speer * Helmut Stauss as judge Roland Freisler * Matthew Burton as Lieutenant General Adolf Heusinger * Philipp von Schulthess as Major General Henning von Tresckow's aide: The actor is the grandson of Claus von Stauffenberg.As depicted in the film, Stauffenberg's wife was pregnant with Von Schulthess' mother during the events of 1944. * Chris Larkin as Sergeant Helm Patrick Wilson was originally cast in Valkyrie, but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts and other unspecified reasons. Stephen Fry was also offered a role in the film but was unable to participate. Some of the non-German actors initially experimented with German accents, but Singer discarded the idea, instead instructing them to adopt neutral accents that \\"[wouldn't] distract from the story\\". Singer added he was not making a docu-drama and wanted to make the story engaging. Production =Development= In 2002, Christopher McQuarrie visited Berlin while researching another project and visited the memorial to von Stauffenberg at the Bendlerblock. Researching the 20 July plot, he was moved and fascinated by the fact that the conspirators were fully aware of what would happen if they failed their assassination attempt, and he wanted to make their story more well-known. He approached Nathan Alexander to co-write the film, and Alexander began researching the project. McQuarrie sought to model the story after the 2001 TV film Conspiracy, which depicted the Wannsee Conference at which the Nazis planned the Final Solution. (Branagh, McNally and McNeice had all starred in Conspiracy.) He also sought to direct the film, until he realized that adequate financing would only be secured with Bryan Singer directing. After Singer completed the three major productions X-Men (2000), X2 (2003) and Superman Returns (2006), he sought a smaller project before embarking upon the eventually aborted sequel to Superman Returns. Singer and McQuarrie had often made World War II films in their backyards while growing up in New Jersey, and Singer had later dealt with Nazi subject matter in Apt Pupil and X-Men. Singer first learned of the plot in the early 1980s when his mother visited Bonn and met Freya von Moltke, widow of Helmuth von Moltke, a founder of the Kreisau Circle resistance group. After learning of McQuarrie and Alexander's screenplay and signing on to direct Valkyrie, Singer read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William L. Shirer to gain deeper understanding of Nazi Germany's political landscape, and also met with one of Hitler's bodyguards, Rochus Misch, who was the last person to leave the bunker where Hitler committed suicide. The creative team acknowledged the ambiguity over the enigmatic von Stauffenberg's true motivation, but Singer and McQuarrie judged him to be a man of ethics just from what he did. Enter the main site and click \\"Navigation\\" to access. Though McQuarrie sought for Valkyrie to be similar to Conspiracy, Singer had bigger ambitions for the film, wanting it to be more than \\"old men in rooms, talking\\". Singer looked back on his decision, saying, \\"The true story had all the makings of a classic assassination thriller. ... I knew if I could keep the audience with [von] Stauffenberg, with his mission, they would go with the flow and be less inclined to start hypothesising on things from history.\\" McQuarrie suggested they bring the project to United Artists partners Paula Wagner and Tom Cruise, who immediately agreed to finance the film in March 2007. Singer invited Tom Cruise to take the lead role, which Cruise accepted. Cruise had been provided a picture of von Stauffenberg, in which the actor noticed a similarity in his profile with the German colonel, drawing him to the role. The director and the screenwriter initially anticipated Valkyrie as a \\"small\\" film with a budget of under US$20 million and to be completed within several months, but Cruise's interest in playing von Stauffenberg made Singer realize his involvement could broaden the film's publicity and therefore its budget. The film's budget was then raised to $60 million. The director considered calling the film Operation Valkyrie, not wanting to use a generic action film title. The film's English-language title was ultimately titled Valkyrie because Singer felt that the film was about more than the operation and liked its connection to Wagner's music. Bendlerblock, where the conspirators were executed in real life, was originally denied as a filming location for Valkyrie Germany's Finance Ministry had originally denied the producers the right to film at Bendlerblock, explaining that the site should be treated as a \\"place of remembrance and mourning\\" which would \\"lose dignity if we were to exploit it as a film set\\". The producers were also denied a request to film at a Berlin police station by the department, citing adverse impact to the facility. The German government eventually had a change of heart concerning the Bendlerblock site and gave permission for filmmakers to film there. A United Artists spokesman said that they were \\"very grateful\\" for the decision, saying that the site \\"[had] always been important to us symbolically, creatively and for the sake of historical authenticity\\" and that the company had been in continuous talks with the German government in order to clear up any misconceptions about the nature of the film. The Memorial to the German Resistance also helped filmmakers by permitting them access to their materials and documents. German military pageantry was shaped by referring to the recorded material and input from military advisers. =Writing= McQuarrie and Alexander researched first-hand accounts, photos, newsreels and texts. They also examined Gestapo and SS records, as the organizations had been meticulous in reconstructing the events of the conspiracy in its aftermath. A timeline of events was created, from which McQuarrie and Alexander shaped the script. After production began in Berlin, the writers were able to visit locations and meet with relatives of the conspirators; these meetings informed changes made to the script during filming. The initial scenes of von Stauffenberg in Tunisia were written to provide historical context to the rest of the film. The scenes were written with the intention of communicating the complexity of the situation‚Äîincluding references to the Holocaust‚Äîwithout being too obvious. The writers also wanted to evoke the spirit of the resistance and convey the ongoing disgust of the German officers. McQuarrie and Alexander found the most difficult task was in conveying the motives of the conspirators; von Stauffenberg especially remained an enigma, though the writers believed he and the other resistance members to be propelled by their moral outrage. McQuarrie and Alexander attempted to include a scene of von Stauffenberg's witnessing an atrocity, but because he was a supply officer he had little exposure to many of those that occurred. Though he witnessed some‚Äîsuch as the starvation of the Russians‚Äîthey believed it difficult to dramatize von Stauffenberg's being compelled to action by \\"field reports\\". They also had difficulties with Hitler's portrayal; in researching his speeches, they struggled to find one in which he made overtly villainous statements. =Filming= Filming began on July 18, 2007, in Berlin. Production of Valkyrie was then estimated to have a budget of US$80 million, with two-thirds to be spent in Germany. The issued ‚Ç¨4.8 million (US$6.64 million) to United Artists to assist with production. The filmmakers received permission to film at Tempelhof International Airport's Columbia Haus, a former Nazi jail for political prisoners. Production also involved World War II planes with swastikas painted on the sides, practicing in the airspace above Brandenburg. Around 70 sets were built for the film. The filmmakers also shot on location at the former Reich Air Ministry Building and the exterior of the house at which von Stauffenberg stayed with his brother. A replica set of Hitler's Eastern Front Headquarters Wolf's Lair was constructed south of Berlin, though the headquarters' actual location was in modern-day northeastern Poland. It took twelve weeks to build. Filming took place in some of the houses that were used to hide the bombs in 1944. The interior of Hitler's Bavarian residence Berghof was replicated using film shot by Hitler's consort Eva Braun and designing models of furniture possessed by secretive collectors. The production also made use of surviving Nazi relics, including furniture used by the Reich Ministry and objects that once adorned Hitler's desk. Nazi symbols, the display of which is heavily restricted in Germany, were used at several locations; while the filmmakers gave forewarning to local residents, a passerby witnessing the use of swastikas during filming in Berlin filed an official complaint with the city. Similar charges were filed against the owners of sites set up to show Nazi displays for the film's production. Filming also took place at Babelsberg Studios. During filming on August 19, 2007, eleven people were hurt when the side panel of a truck they were riding broke, with one person requiring hospitalization. They demanded $11 million in compensation, rejecting a settlement offered by the studio. Before filming the scene of von Stauffenberg's execution at Bendlerblock, Tom Cruise led the cast and crew in holding a moment of silence \\"out of respect for the place and out of respect for the life achievement of these people who were executed there\\", according to actor Christian Berkel. After filming of the scene was completed, the footage was sent to be developed for the post-production process at a processing plant in Germany. The wrong chemical was accidentally used in development, damaging the film and requiring the crew to seek permission from the government to re-shoot the scenes. Permission was granted and a spokesman for the film indicated the schedule and budget had not been affected. Singer and cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel chose different styles for the separate halves of the film. Elegant camerawork such as cranes were used for the build-up to the attempt on Hitler's life, while the second half is frantic with handheld cinematography as the plotters are hunted down. The colors in the film also become more intense as the story continues. Sigel focused on red, the color of the Nazi flag, which he felt represented the violence of their ideology. Singer looked towards thrillers of the 1940s and home movies shot by Eva Braun for inspiration. Shooting scenes at night was difficult because presenting the era accurately required blackouts. Sigel noted that, in real life, car headlights were used for the firing squad to aim at and execute the plotters in the Bendlerblock. Singer chose to shoot in 1:85 aspect ratio and, since filming took place in Germany, the director used Arriflex cameras with Zeiss lenses. The Tunisia battle sequence that opened the film was the last major sequence filmed. The filmmakers wanted to avoid the appearance that von Stauffenberg wanted to kill Hitler because of the injuries he suffered in the battle. They began a rough cut in October 2007 and, between then and June 2008, there were several test screenings without the battle sequence. By June 2008, the filmmakers felt that they knew how to adequately frame the characters when filming the battle sequence. Singer scouted Jordan and Spain for locations, but the candidates did not meet the aesthetic and economic criteria. The Cougar Buttes desert in California was ultimately chosen to represent Tunisia. Since the production budget was adjusted to provide visual effects to make von Stauffenberg's injuries realistic, not enough was left for solely computer-generated fighter planes. Singer instead used two P-40 Warhawks in the battle sequence. The budget increased in the course of production due to the filming in Germany, the rebuilding of sets, and lost shooting days, but German tax rebates tempered the growth. The studio reported its final production budget to be $75 million, but competing studios believed it to be closer to $90 million. =Visual effects= The film's visual effects were created by Sony Pictures Imageworks, who collaborated with Bryan Singer on Superman Returns. The company's two key goals were to accurately portray von Stauffenberg's injuries and to create a 1943 period look to Berlin. With many explosions and stunts seen in the film performed practically, the majority of the 800 computer-generated effects shots were used to portray von Stauffenberg's injuries. A digital version of Cruise's hand was designed, and technicians rotoscoped the hand in every movement it could make so the missing fingers were erased in the process. With many close-ups of von Stauffenberg's hand with missing fingers, the injuries were textured to look like actual scars, particularly based on surgical procedures from 1943. Cruise asked for advice on how to best move his hands so visual effects would be easier to apply, but some challenges, such as von Stauffenberg getting dressed on his own, were inescapable. According to supervisor Richard R. Hoover, \\"We know from historical accounts that von Stauffenberg didn't stick his hands in his pockets to try and hide his injuries.\\" For the battle sequence in North Africa, two real Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks in Desert Air Force paint schemes were used, accompanied by cloned images of them or by computer-generated planes. In scenes showing squadrons of soldiers, digital extras were not used; instead, photography of real squadrons was cloned. Sony Pictures Imageworks also digitally expanded details on stage locations and at practical locations. The exterior of Hitler's Bavarian residence Berghof was digitally created, since little was left of the original structure, and the creation was superimposed on a shot of a ski area in Austria. In Berlin itself, city officials helped reduce the need for visual effects by removing power poles and modern lighting over the weekend when filming took place and restoring the equipment by the start of the new week. There was widespread questioning in some corners of the press as to whether, in order to make himself look more muscular and of ample girth, Cruise had employed butt pads during filming.https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/tom- cruise-fake-butt-bum-ass-valkyrie-shot-responds-twitter- tweet-a7972086.htmlhttps://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/amp/2017/09/28/everything- you-need-to-know-about-the-tom-cruise-fake-ass-conspiracy_a_23225531/ The star eventually addressed and denied the suppositions.https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/28/entertainment/tom-cruise-fake- butt/index.htmlhttps://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a19536641/tom-cruise-fake- butt-rumors/ =Editing and scoring= As with his previous collaborations with Bryan Singer on The Usual Suspects, Superman Returns and X2, editor and composer John Ottman edited the film without a temp track, noting if the film was working well without music, it was becoming a strong product. Since Valkyrie drew its inspirations from previous World War II films like The Great Escape (1963), Where Eagles Dare (1968), Patton (1970), and Midway (1976), filmmakers initially had a cut where title cards introduced characters and their roles. When the cut was test screened with an American audience, the title cards were removed due to complaints that there were too many characters to follow. Ottman said the challenge on Valkyrie was to create tension from dialogue scenes, and he often reshaped scenes to do this: moments rather than whole scenes were cut from the film. Being historically accurate meant Ottman was more restricted in reorganizing scenes, but he was able to choose what lines and close-ups he could focus on. Ottman said the scene he was most saddened to delete, because he had been looking forward to scoring it, was one where von Stauffenberg dances with his wife . Ottman originally planned to compose a minimal score to Valkyrie, but found that despite the film's dialogue-heavy nature, the film needed music to create a thriller atmosphere. Ottman described the new approach, \\"It's very much like Usual Suspects‚Äîin order to keep the tension going in a scene where there's really a lot of dialogue, we had to rely on a lot of score. But the score is done in a very sort of pulsating, subliminal way. It's not an expository score, it's more like a running pulse going through the movie.\\" Singer applied an imaginary metronome, \\"which only began clicking\\" when he watched scenes where the pace was becoming faster. He had a specific theme he wanted for the film, which was more modern than \\"The Winds of War\\"-type score he expected Ottman to do. Another challenge in composing thriller music was that the score needed to \\"slowly lapse\\" into the tragedy of the film's ending. The finished score has some percussion instruments and few brass, but no snare drums or trumpets, which were the conventions Singer and Ottman avoided. Ottman had to compose music for the North African battle before the scene was shot, because booking space to record film music is difficult. Although he found that composing music based on the script results in overlong pieces, he felt the music worked out fine for the sequence. The film's end credits piece, \\"They'll Remember You\\", is an original composition, but the lyrics were based on the poem \\"Wanderer's Nightsong\\" by German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. An end piece entitled \\"Long Live Sacred Germany\\" was inspired by Adagio for Strings, in the sense it would not feel like film music tailored to every moment in the scene, but still fit with what was going on. Ottman described the original version of the track as a \\"three minute drone that I slowed down with these two Tuvan throat singers, the whole thing was this horribly dark, morbid piece [which] left you cold\\". Ottman composed a metallic motif for Hitler, which was formed by low strings and a piano cluster. German response to production In June 2007, prior to production, a German Defence Ministry spokesperson said that filming of Valkyrie would not be allowed at the country's military sites if protagonist Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg was portrayed by Tom Cruise, due to the actor's adherence to Scientology, which is considered a dangerous cult by the German authorities. The spokesperson further indicated that the ministry had not at that time received official filming requests from Valkyries producers. Colonel Stauffenberg's eldest child, retired Bundeswehr general Berthold Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, also voiced concerns over Cruise's portrayal of his father, saying that he would not oppose the film's production, but hoped that Cruise would drop the role. \\"I fear that only terrible kitsch will come out of the project. It's bound to be rubbish,\\" he said. \\"Cruise should keep his hands off my father.\\" Later in the month, the ministry reversed its stance and welcomed production of Valkyrie. The initial controversy reportedly stemmed from German member of parliament Antje Blumenthal, an authority on cults for the Christian Democratic Union and well- known opponent of Scientology, who had claimed that the German Defence Minister had assured her that the film would not be shot in the country. In addition, Cruise's affiliation with Scientology was also criticized by junior politicians such as Rudolf K√∂berle, the state secretary for interior issues in the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Thomas Gandow, a spokesperson for the German Protestant Church, said Cruise's involvement in the film would \\"have the same propaganda advantages for Scientology as the 1936 Olympics had for the Nazis\\" and compared the actor to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. The film subsequently found local support in Germany. Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck saw that Cruise's involvement would promote awareness of a neglected story, and veteran German actor Armin Mueller-Stahl also gave his support to the production. A grandson of Colonel von Stauffenberg, who appeared in the film as an assistant, hailed Cruise's professionalism and indicated that most of his family were curious to see the finished product. In September 2007, when the Defence Ministry initially denied permission for filming at the Bendlerblock memorial, support for the film came in from German newspaper columnists and filmmakers, including director Wolfgang Petersen and Frank Schirrmacher, journalist and co-publisher of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Schirrmacher visited the set and agreed that the film would advance global awareness of the German Resistance. Ultimately granting access to the Bendlerblock after reviewing the script, the Defence Ministry said it showed that \\"barbarism didn't triumph but led to the founding of a democratic Germany\\". Ursula Caberta, who is in charge of a German government office which monitors Scientology, was disappointed in the ministry's decision, saying, \\"Tom Cruise [is] a figurehead of an anti-constitutional organization, and he should be treated that way.\\" A spokesperson for Scientology in Berlin, Sabine Weber, said in August 2007 that she was \\"shocked\\" by German politicians' criticisms, adding that it was a \\"call to discrimination\\" against someone based on their religious beliefs. In the same month, Cruise suggested to his critics that they see the film before denouncing it. In October 2007, fellow Valkyrie actor Kenneth Branagh said that the issue had been \\"largely exaggerated\\" and that the German official who initially incited the complaints contacted the production one week into filming to apologise, after reading the script and realising he had misinterpreted the film's plot. In November 2007, the head of the German Resistance Memorial Centre warned against any potential \\"myth formation\\" around von Stauffenberg as a result of the film, urging that any understanding of the Colonel must also be informed by the fact that he had been loyal to the Nazi cause for most of his military career. In the same month Cruise was given a Bambi courage award, presented by German media company Hubert Burda Media, \\"for tackling a story that had never been covered by Hollywood before\\". Klaus Berg of the Hamburg Chronicle noted that \\"... It is a well-known cliche that American film makers prefer to provide their audiences with a happy ending. Here, a viewer with even the most superficial and rudimentary knowledge of the history of the Second World War and of the National Socialist Regime would know from the very outset that a happy ending is out of the question, that all the protagonists' efforts and plans are doomed to end in bitter failure. Knowing this, I was surprised to realize how deeply I was caught up in the tension of the plot, how desperately I was hoping against hope that Cruise and his fellows would after all succeed. ... No, not for one minute during the entire film did I think about Scientology.\\" Klaus Berg, \\"A belated review of Cruise and Valkyrie\\" in Hamburg Chronicle, June 23, 2011 Marketing Valkyrie was intended to be a high-profile film that would jump-start United Artists, the host studio partly owned by Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner. Pressure was placed on Valkyrie to do well since an earlier United Artists film featuring Cruise, Lions for Lambs, performed poorly in the box office, and the studio's planned production of Oliver Stone's Pinkville was canceled. The film changed release dates multiple times. It was originally slated to be released on August 8, 2008, then moved up earlier to June 27, 2008. The film was then held off to October 3, 2008, to avoid competition from WALL-E and Wanted, and to enable the late filming of the North African battle sequence. The October date was also originally chosen to increase the film's chances of awards success. In April 2008, the release date was pushed back to February 13, 2009, with the studio citing the early fall schedule as too crowded with Academy Award prospects. Valkyrie would have taken advantage of the lucrative President's Day weekend, after The Wolfman and The Pink Panther 2 were moved from this date. In July 2008, United Artists president of worldwide marketing Dennis Rice was replaced by Michael Vollman, who was tasked to develop a marketing strategy for the \\"troubled\\" Valkyrie, which had been \\"battered by constant media sniping\\". Under Vollman, by August 2008, the release date was changed to December 26, 2008, with reports citing commercial reasons for the move after a successful test screening. (The film was ultimately released on Christmas Day, December 25, 2008.) The release date was before the end of December, which \\"crucially\\" helped the film with a home distribution deal with the subscription channel Showtime. In the same month of August, Paula Wagner left her position with the studio during the film's post- production. The changing release date for Valkyrie drew criticism about the viability of United Artists, and the studio aimed to combat the criticism leading up to the film's eventual release. In addition, the first theatrical trailer, released early in 2008, received \\"mixed buzz\\" over Tom Cruise's portraying von Stauffenberg with an American accent. The trade paper Variety described the trailer as \\"dour and ... like it was selling a talky stage play with a cast of old British actors\\". Images of Tom Cruise as Colonel von Stauffenberg that surfaced during filming were widely ridiculed. Terry Press, a marketing consultant with the studio, said that Valkyrie had been wrongly labeled as \\"the Tom Cruise eye-patch movie\\". As the December release date approached, United Artists launched a campaign to reform public perception of the film, downplaying the role of Tom Cruise as a German war hero and instead pitching Valkyrie as \\"a character-driven suspense thriller\\". The new campaign also played up the reputation of director Bryan Singer, who had directed the thrillers The Usual Suspects (1995) and Apt Pupil (1998). Terry Press urged foregoing an awards campaign for the film; Cruise agreed with the consultant, while Singer was disappointed about the decision. Instead, the studio focused on audience appeal in a competitive time frame in late December. A second theatrical trailer and a new poster were unveiled in October 2008 by United Artists to renew Valkyrie's viability with audiences and accolades. The poster was designed to have flashy graphics and to emulate the posters from the war films The Great Escape (1963) and The Dirty Dozen (1967) in having a team as a central visual. The team element was based on market research from the studio's focus groups who indicated that they liked Cruise as \\"a character leading a group of people toward solving a problem\\". The new trailer accentuated action, and was widely considered an improvement over the first trailer. An internal MGM memo reported the reception of the trailer by online communities to be \\"significantly favorable\\" compared to the previous trailer. The studio sought two demographic quadrants: males over 35 years old as well as younger males. Since United Artists reported that the film cost $75 million to make and that $60 million was spent on marketing, the studio faced high financial stakes. The film also tested the determination of its distributor Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and the mettle of Cruise as a superstar. Release =Theatrical run= Prior to Valkyries December 2008 release, concern was raised about how the film would be received in the holiday season due to its Nazi subject matter, along with related films The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, The Reader, Defiance and Good. Advertising Age wrote during the economic crisis of 2008, \\"The depressing state of the economy and an alarmingly low level of understanding of the Holocaust among American youth point to a tough road for such serious fare.\\" Valkyrie opened on Christmas Day, December 25, 2008, in 2,711 theaters in the United States and Canada. The film grossed an estimated $8.5 million for the opening day. In the four-day holiday weekend, Valkyrie grossed an estimated $30 million, ranking fourth at the box office with $7,942 per theater. Pamela McClintock of Variety cited the weekend performance as \\"a victory for United Artists and MGM\\"; Gitesh Pandya of Rotten Tomatoes said the haul represented a \\"big hit\\" for the studio. Studio research revealed that audiences averaged 55% male and 66% over 25. Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Media By Numbers, said that the weekend gross \\"totally robs the nay-sayers of their ability to deem it a flop\\", believing that Cruise's comic performance in the previous summer's Tropic Thunder helped audiences embrace the star again. Dergarabedian also ascribed the better-than- expected performance to the studio's marketing of Valkyrie as a thriller film. Since Cruise was collecting a salary of $20 million against 20% of the backend (revenue gathered after the completion of a film) and MGM/UA investment was capped at $60 million, United Artists sold the film to several foreign territories to make money back. The European premiere was held at the Potsdamer Platz in Berlin on January 20, 2009. Valkyrie commercially opened in over a dozen territories outside the United States and Canada on the weekend of January 23, 2009, including a premiere in Germany on January 22. The film ranked first in the international box office, grossing over $13 million. It placed first in Germany, Australia, and the Netherlands and placed second in the United Kingdom, Austria and South Korea. Valkyries highest-grossing territory was Germany, where it earned $3.7 million from 689 locations, averaging $5,311 per screen. The German opening was considered \\"a chart- topping yet unspectacular start\\", barely edging out Twilight, which opened three weeks before. BBC News reported that the premiere of the film has renewed the topic of the German Resistance among the German populace. The film opened in 13 additional territories on the weekend of January 30, including Russia and Spain. With 3,600 screenings in 26 markets, the film grossed $18.6 million to maintain its top placement at the international box office for a second weekend in a row. Spain was its highest-grossing territory with $2.8 million, followed by Germany with $2.3 million, the United Kingdom with $2 million, and $1.9 million in Italy. As of April 13, 2009, the film has grossed $83,079,000 in the United States and Canada and an estimated $117,198,951 in other territories for a worldwide gross of $200,276,784. =Anti-Scientology protests= A masked protester with a sign saying \\"Tom Cruise Cult Hero\\" at the London premiere is confronted by an unidentified woman who attempts to forcibly wrestle the sign from her grasp. When Valkyrie premiered in New York City on December 15, 2008, it was shown in a private screening room at the Time Warner Center, rather than at a Lincoln Square theater. The venue was chosen in part to minimize the exposure to Scientology protesters gathered at the Time Warner Center. While the US \\"red carpet\\" was held in private, Cruise interacted with fans in South Korea and Europe. There were small anti- Scientology protests at the European premiere in Berlin, where Cruise signed one protester's Guy Fawkes mask. Anti-Scientology protests also occurred at the London premiere, and Amsterdam where Scientologists in the crowd engaged the protesters. The NTV news report about the January 26 Moscow premiere noted that journalists had to sign a document promising not to ask questions about Scientology, and their questions would be censored; to this, the reporter remarked, \\"You can't help getting reminded of those historic times depicted in Operation Valkyrie.\\" In Germany, authorities and politicians expressed concern that if the film was successful, it would boost Scientology in the country. German politician Michael Brand encouraged his deputies to boycott Valkyrie, saying that Scientology pursued \\"totalitarian goals\\". Germany's Agency for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), which monitors the presence of Scientology in the country, expressed concern about the film's impact. An anonymous BfV official said, \\"These Scientologists have two goals in Germany ... to get their message to children, and make their organization respectable. The film does both: it has put a top Scientologist at the center of a national debate about German history.\\" In January 2009, Cruise appeared in the highly popular German-Swiss-Austrian TV show, Wetten, dass. Cruise had already left the show, when German comedian Michael Mittermeier said: \\"In an interview, Tom Cruise claimed that he would have killed Hitler, too. To me, it would be sufficient if he had killed the F√ºhrer of Scientology.\\"K√∂lnische Rundschau , seen 2010-07-02. \\"Tom Cruise hat in einem Interview gesagt, er h√§tte Hitler auch get√∂tet. Mir h√§tte es gereicht, wenn er den F√ºhrer von Scientology get√∂tet h√§tte.\\" Prior to the show, members of the Christian Democratic Junge Union protested against the broadcaster for being uncritical about Scientology.Morgenpost, seen 2010-07-02. =Home media= Valkyrie was released on DVD and Blu-ray on May 19, 2009, in three configurations: a single DVD edition, a two-DVD set, and a Blu-ray version. Valkyrie opened at #2 on the DVD sales chart, selling 844,264 units translating to revenue of $14,816,833. According to the latest figures, 1,631,011 units have been sold, bringing in $27,042,657 in revenue. Reception The movie website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 62%, based on 196 reviews, with an average rating of 6.19/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Given the subject matter, Valkyrie could have been an outstanding historical thriller, but settles for being a mildly entertaining, but disposable yarn.\\" At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 56 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". In the United States, the film received mixed reviews from critics, however in Germany, there were different reports about how Valkyrie was received. The New York Times wrote, \\"It has been greeted with a measured and hospitable reception in Germany, where it was once viewed with suspicion.\\" The trade paper Variety reported that despite the controversy over Cruise's ties to Scientology, \\"[I]nitial reviews have been positive, with many observers now hailing Cruise and predicting the pic will even improve the country's image abroad.\\" Der Spiegel said that the film and its supporting actors were praised, but that Cruise was panned by German critics for \\"a surprisingly low-key performance that fails to convey the charisma with which Stauffenberg inspired fellow plotters\\". The AFP also said that the German critics \\"savaged Tom Cruise's portrayal\\" of von Stauffenberg, yet \\"relished a homegrown hero getting the Hollywood treatment\\". =American critics= Joe Morganstern wrote in The Wall Street Journal, \\"Mr. Cruise's performance turns out to be brisk and reasonably plausible, though unexceptional, while the production as a whole succeeds as an elaborate procedural, impressively staged in historical locations.\\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times thought that Cruise gave \\"a fine, typically energetic performance in a film that requires nothing more of him than a profile and vigor\\" but that von Stauffenberg was too complex a character to adequately portray in a film designed as a thriller. Dargis also wrote of the director's excess, \\"Though Mr. Singer's old-fashioned movie habits, his attention to the gloss, gleam and glamour of the image, can be agreeably pleasurable, he tends to gild every lily,\\" citing as an example the \\"spooky music\\" and \\"low camera angles\\" in the meeting between Hitler and von Stauffenberg. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times also found Cruise \\"perfectly satisfactory, if not electrifying, in the leading role\\", believing that the portrayal fit the \\"veterans of officer rank\\" that would not panic under fire; Ebert recognizes that \\"Singer ... works heroically to introduce us to the major figures in the plot, to tell them apart, to explain their roles and to suggest their differences.\\" Writing in Time, Richard Schickel said, \\"I'm not going to argue that Valkyrie is a great movie. But in its way it is a thoughtful and entertaining one, especially in comparison with the pomp and pretentiousness of most of the competition this holiday season.\\" Ty Burr of The Boston Globe described the film: \\"It's a smooth, compelling, almost suspenseful ... and slightly hollow Hollywood period piece‚Äîa World War II action-drama in which an intriguing (but not electrifying) star performance is buttressed by stellar support.\\" Burr analyzed Cruise's performance: \\"... his Claus von Stauffenberg is an honorable conception that's ultimately too thin to fully rise up from the pages of history. This story deserves to be told, but for reasons best known to himself, the star has latched onto a strictly Nietzschean interpretation that he rides into the ground.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today thought of Cruise as \\"unconvincing and stiff as the disenchanted\\" von Stauffenberg. She felt that the film started slowly and that \\"even during scenes of intense action, the visually slick production is only minimally engrossing\\". She concluded of the film's overall pace, \\"The action becomes more engrossing during the film's second half, but one expects more depth and nuance, given its pedigree.\\" Anthony Lane of The New Yorker wrote, \\"[Cruise] carries the movie, although, once you dig beneath the uniform, there isn't much for him to get a handle on; the fascination with Stauffenberg resides in what he did, not in who he was.\\" Lane thought that there was \\"too much\\" character acting of the British veteran actors and felt of the casting of Nighy, Stamp, and Wilkinson, \\"These men are meant to be battle-toughened Nazi officers, but what we get is an array of discreetly amusing studies in mild neurosis.\\" Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote that Valkyrie \\"has visual splendor galore, but is a cold work lacking in the requisite tension and suspense\\". McCarthy considered Cruise as \\"a bit stiff but still adequate\\" as von Stauffenberg. The critic believed that McQuarrie's script was well-carpentered but felt that compressing and streamlining the events to make a known failed plot more thrilling lacked a \\"sufficient sizzle into the dialogue or individuality into the characters\\". McCarthy missed \\"many of the interesting personal and political nuances pertaining to these men\\" that were not detailed. He thought that the production design by Lilly Kilvert and Patrick Lumb stood out, that Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography had a \\"restrained elegance\\", and that John Ottman performed well in his dual role as editor and composer. A similar sentiment was stated by Mike LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle, who wrote \\"There's nothing inherently laughable about the spectacle of Tom Cruise with an eye patch and a missing hand, strutting around in a German colonel's uniform. But neither is there anything about him that truly suggests Claus von Stauffenberg, leader of the 1944 conspiracy to decapitate the Nazi government and stage a coup d'etat. Think of Valkyrie as a reasonably entertaining drama about the time Tom Cruise tried to kill Hitler. Do that, and it becomes possible to enjoy the movie. =German critics= Despite differences over the quality of the film, critics were in agreement that the film had drawn attention to von Stauffenberg's cause. It was applauded \\"both as a history lesson and as a film\\". Tobias Kniebe of the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung described the film as \\"maybe not the masterpiece we might have dreamed of ... but not much less\\", a sentiment shared by many German critics. The public- service German television channel ZDF called Valkyrie \\"neither scandalously bad nor the event of the century. ... Neither is it the action thriller we feared, but it is a well-made and serious film.\\" The newspaper K√∂lner Stadt- Anzeiger reported that any fear that the \\"myth of the German resistance would be put through a Hollywood filter has turned out to be wrong and prejudicial\\". Other critics thought that Tom Cruise did not \\"make the grade\\" as a German war hero. The film critic for Der Tagesspiegel wrote, \\"[Cruise's] image as an actor has been finally ruined by Valkyrie ... [the film] doesn't dare to be popcorn cinema and at the same time lacks any conceptual brilliance.\\" Hanns- Georg Rodek of Die Welt reported of Cruise's performance, \\"He comes over best as an American hero, someone who battles for respect with aggression and energy. But Stauffenberg was a German hero, with aristocratic bearing, and Cruise cannot carry that off.\\" The Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung said Cruise's performance was \\"credible\\", and reserved praise for the authenticity of the dubbed German-language version of the film over the original. =Awards and honors= Valkyrie was nominated by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films for seven Saturn Awards: Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film, Best Director for Bryan Singer, Best Actor for Tom Cruise, Best Supporting Actor for Bill Nighy, Best Supporting Actress for Carice van Houten, Best Music for John Ottman and Best Costume for Joanna Johnston. The film was nominated by the Visual Effects Society Awards in the category of Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Feature Motion Picture. Historical accuracy The Gestapo investigated the 20 July plot thoroughly, so filmmakers had access to much documentation as they integrated the historical account with \\"Hollywood factors\\" in producing Valkyrie. Peter Hoffmann, professor of history at McGill University and a leading authority on the German Resistance, was a consultant for the filmmakers. Hoffmann spoke of the film's accuracy, \\"[Valkyrie] gives a fundamentally accurate portrait of Stauffenberg and the conspirators. There are details which must be counted as liberties. But, fundamentally, the film is decent, respectful and represents the spirit of the conspiracy.\\" The Scotsman reported of the film's accuracy, \\"Valkyrie ... sticks pretty closely to the story of the failed conspiracy to topple the Nazi regime ... it implies that the plot came closer to success than it really did. But the basic facts are all present and correct.\\" While von Stauffenberg listens to Richard Wagner's \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\" in the film, in reality the colonel hated Wagner. In addition, von Stauffenberg's elder brother Berthold was also omitted from the film. Bryan Singer purposely left out some of von Stauffenberg's \\"macho\\" moments in writing the character, such as the colonel's refusal of morphine to avoid addiction. He explained the removals, \\"There were things I actually left out because I knew people would think we were making them up ... imagine Tom Cruise saying 'No morphine!' People would think it's a contrivance.\\" In the film, von Haeften steps out in front of von Stauffenberg when he faces the firing squad, but when filmmakers attempted to reconstruct the scene based on eyewitness testimony and photographs, they discovered that the shots that killed von Haeften would also have killed von Stauffenberg, who was actually shot shortly after. Another alteration was to the portrayal of Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, played in the film by Kevin McNally. Goerdeler was written in the film to be antagonistic, dramatically representing the friction and conflict that existed within the conspiracy, though filmmakers considered him a \\"much more moral character\\" in reality. One significant historical alteration, made to avoid confusion with the audience and also to \\"set the stage\\" at the Wolf's Lair, was changing the location of the first aborted assassination attempt to kill Hitler on July 11.Bergstrom Papers, LLC. (2009). \\"The Making of Valkyrie\\". WWII History, 33-38 Historically, Stauffenberg first attempted to use his briefcase bomb at Berchtesgaden; in the film, this attempt is set inside Hitler's concrete bunker at the Wolf's Lair while the Berchtesgaden affair is downgraded to a brief scene in which Hitler meets with Stauffenberg to approve a revised plan for Operation Valkyrie (in reality, the Valkyrie updates occurred over a period of several weeks at meetings between Hitler and General Olbricht).Moorhouse, R., Killing Hitler: The Plots, The Assassins, and the Dictator Who Cheated Death, Bantam (2007) Producer Christopher McQuarrie later stated that the shift of the first assassination attempt to the Wolf's Lair was in order to show the audience the inside of the concrete command bunker, with the intent being to emphasize that Hitler most certainly would have been killed had the July 20th attempt not been moved to the outdoor conference hut.\\"About Valkyrie\\" (Interview by Historynet.com), retrieved November 28, 2008 British novelist Justin Cartwright, who wrote the book The Song Before It Is Sung about one of the plot's conspirators, wrote, \\"The film is true to most of the facts of the plot, but fails to convey any sense of the catastrophic moral and political vortex into which Germans were being drawn.\\" Though not depicted, but briefly mentioned in the film, von Stauffenberg was persuaded to become involved in the plot by his uncle, Nikolaus Graf von √úxk√ºll-Gyllenband and his uncle's good friend, Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenburg, who were both disenchanted with the Nazis and appalled by the atrocities in the concentration camps. The film also did not explore von Stauffenberg's philosophy and background, which Cartwright felt fit the German tradition of Dichter und Helden (\\"poets and heroes\\"). Cartwright described how von Stauffenberg was an appropriate leader for the plot: \\"He was the man who unmistakably wore the mantle of a near-mystic German past, a warrior Germany, a noble Germany, a poetic Germany, a Germany of myth and longing.\\" The novelist felt that Cruise's portrayal was more akin to one as a \\"troublesome cop\\". Cartwright also noted that the film did not raise the question of what kind of Germany von Stauffenberg had in mind if the plot succeeded. They did not mention or include Germany's famous Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. He was implicated in the plot (and was later forced to commit suicide) although he refused participation.

Jackson Square, also known as Jackson Square, is an indoor shopping mall, commercial, and entertainment complex located in the downtown core of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, which is named after Lloyd Douglas Jackson, who served as mayor of the city from 1950 to 1962. The civic square is located in the centre of the city, bounded by several major roads: King Street (south), Bay Street (west), York Boulevard (north) and James Street (east), with the appointed address being 2 King Street West. The mall officially opened in 1972. History In the early twentieth century, the city of Hamilton petitioned for funds to complete a modernist makeover of its downtown core under the newly amended National Housing Act (1954).Rockwell, Margaret. \\"The Facelift and the Wrecking Ball: Urban Renewal and Hamilton's King Street West, 1957-1971.\\" Urban History Review 37, no. 2 (2009): 53-61 The revised legislation provided for cost sharing amongst the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) and the federal and municipal government, in preparation for urban renewal studies. It also included provisions for implementing the results of these studies, including clearing property and upgrading public services.Lowden, J. D., 1970. Urban Renewal in Canada - A Postmortem. Master of Arts thesis in Community and Regional Planning. University of British Columbia, 1970 With a majority of Hamilton's employment based in the industrial sector, the city's modernist planners wished to divide the municipality into practical zones that would serve specific functions, and to connect the zones with efficient transportation corridors that could move goods quickly and without disruption. Local politicians and business owners favoured such plans and began to view their mostly Victorian urban landscape as disjointed, crowded, and unfit for the navigation of the vehicles that were beginning to crowd the streets.Mascotto-Carbone, Lucas, and Julia Mortimer. \\"The Stomps of Progress: Hamilton's Civic Square and the Rise of an Urban Heritage Renewal Movement.\\" OAA Perspectives 22.4 (2014): 21-26. Web. Starting in 1957, the Hamilton Downtown Association began to pressure the federal government to fund an urban renewal study. When the study was completed a year later in 1958, federal planner Mark David was unable to recommend redevelopment in the downtown core because the federal cost-sharing program that was a part of the National Housing Act only allotted funds for the improvement of housing conditions amongst Canada's urban slums. Despite this setback, funds were granted following the completion of the study for the relocation of cottages on the Lake Ontario beach and the clearance of derelict housing in the city's residential North End neighbourhood. Hamilton businessmen, still set on renewing the commercial core, continued to lobby for amendments that would allow downtown redevelopment. In 1964, the housing act was altered to include civic improvement and Hamilton was the first city to apply for funding. In April 1965, city planner Murray Jones unveiled his plans for a new downtown civic square. Under his plan, axial pools would form the centre of the complex with a planetarium in the middle. There would be a sculpture court, a large remodelled suburban-style Eaton's department store, an auditorium, a hotel with a garden courtyard, and a library adjacent to the art gallery, with King Street West running one way through the middle. Amongst parcels of open green space, new smaller streets would cut across the public vistas. Roughly 17 hectares (43 acres) of downtown space would be eliminated, and many open areas would be incorporated into the new square, under the assumption that the old slum-like core required plenty of fresh air circulation. The Civic Square plan that was published in The Hamilton Spectator changed the majority of the public‚Äôs opinion on this new change. In addition, the Greater Hamilton Shopping Centre (now known as The Centre on Barton), which had opened ten years earlier east of the city on the old Jockey Club race track, and which had been successful since its opening, had made the core's downtown buildings look antiquated. Despite the wide approval of the original garden-like scheme, by July 1968 the plan had been scrapped in favour of a scheme by Montreal developers Yale Properties that would provide more revenue. As the municipal government hashed out the overall construction cost to build the original plan, controversy stirred amongst officials of CMHC who were under pressure by the federal minister to stop providing money. By October 1968, CMHC had given out approximately $168 million to various Canadian municipalities to upgrade their built infrastructure, but after multiple complaints from watchdog groups and government officials over the casual administrative process and its inability to control the expenditure of private contractors, federal Urban Affairs Minister Robert Andres was forced to halt activities. Ultimately CMHC reverted to its pre-1964 role, which was solely to provide capital resources to create or redevelop residential addresses. Hamilton, therefore, lost its ability to apply or even negotiate for further grants and, as greater pressure was placed on the municipality to pick up the tab, city planners disregarded the gardens and pools of the original plan and looked towards a scheme that would require a minimum amount of funding and produce a maximum amount of revenue for their investment. Yale Properties quickly swooped in and consolidated the originally dispersed commercial and civic components and locked them into two large super-blocks (figures 3 and 4), connected by an indoor mall with no outdoor frontage. High barren walls of brown concrete would line most of the expanded King Street West and all civic components were pushed onto a public square located above the mall and away from the street. The city and developer faced heavy opposition from the citizens who were promised open space, gardens, and long pools of fresh water, but all complaints either went unheeded or were quickly deflected by promises of civic festivals and facilities above the mall complex on the plaza roof or enclosed indoors. =Construction= In June 1968, even before the plans from Yale Properties had been finalized, the city gave King Street business owners six months to vacate the buildings they owned. This came as a shock, since the initial construction start date had been pushed back for years. Demolition of the businesses on the eastern portion of King Street West bounded by James Street North began in late 1968 and was completed by the early summer of 1969. After a hasty ceremony on the barren site that spotlighted local politicians and reiterated the Yale Properties commitment to the modernization of the city, construction hoarding was erected and pillars of concrete quickly followed. Throughout the construction of the first phase of the civic square, renamed Lloyd D. Jackson Square a year later, unfavourable reviews frequently appeared, some labelling the square \\"a people's place.\\"Paikin, T., \\"People Place? It looks like the dream's gone sour.\\" The Hamilton Spectator, 1974. Representatives of local disabled organizations also criticized the developer's refusal to add in wheelchair ramps. Yet, on August 22, 1972, thousands of people climbed to the complex's plaza roof and engaged in a massive ceremony that included live music, food and a fireworks show signalling the grand opening of the mall and adjacent Bank of Montreal's commercial pavilion.Wilson, Paul, www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/talk/ paul-wilson-jackson-square-turns-40-and- fights-for-afuture- 1.1159938 Although Hamiltonians were absolutely enthralled by the wide selection of trendy new stores and restaurants, and by the sheer size of the space, the optimism was swiftly dampened by operational mismanagement. The treatment of the mall's patrons only worsened when on March 1, 1973, the washrooms were discovered to be a hangout for drug dealers and users. The operations manager Charlie Friedman declared, \\"There's no law that washrooms must be provided‚Ä¶If the situation doesn't improve we may lock them up.\\"\\"Mall washrooms suspected drug den.\\" The Hamilton Spectator, 1973. He proceeded to do just that, four days later until, after a week, public outcry forced them open again.\\"To punish the innocent.\\" The Hamilton Spectator, 1973. Then on October 17, 1973, a woman was jailed for several days after walking her dog inside the mall and becoming belligerent after being forced out.\\"Woman jailed for seven days for walking dog in square.\\" The Hamilton Spectator, 1973. Capitalizing on the growing public disdain towards the rigid management of the plaza, The Hamilton Spectator, which had always favoured the original plan for the city's redevelopment, opened fire on the square's construction with columnist Jim Campbell labelling it a \\"pigeon place\\" crowded with too many buildings and bounded by a useless rooftop plaza.Campbell, J., \\"Square called Pigeon Place by Campbell.\\" The Hamilton Spectator, Feb. 19, 1974. The verbal assault continued in the spring of 1974 with opinion columnist Tami Paikin criticizing the lack of grass and open green space, and an unknown writer calling the already rusting buildings \\"complete eyesores.\\"\\"Visual pollution, everyday ugliness.\\" The Hamilton Spectator, June 8, 1974. Soon the complex's high walls of barren concrete and its bland stone rooftop plaza began to generate a feeling of disconnection between the citizens and the square. The initial sense of pride in the project soon withered and paved the way for vandalism as the square continued to expand throughout the 1970s. =Early years= Despite the constant protests against the design of the square and treatment of the patrons, Jackson Square remained an economic success and an important centre of life in the city through the 1970s and into the mid-1980s. After years of dispute and confusion over the future of the Hamilton Farmer's Market, it was consolidated into a new indoor space in 1980,Johnston, B., \\"Lament for a Downtown.\\" The Hamilton Spectator, 2007 coupled with a new, larger central library. Then in 1983, the Standard Life Centre office tower opened at the west end of the complex, when promises of another department store went unfulfilled. And two years later, a 19-story Sheraton Hotel with a pool and overhead connection to the Hamilton Convention Centre opened up alongside a 19,000-seat sports arena called Copps Coliseum (now FirstOntario Centre). It appeared that optimism towards the future of the square had once again permeated the citizens of Hamilton. Yet right at the moment when Jackson Square seemed to be at the very pinnacle of success, disaster struck. On March 25, 1986 the mall management informed Alderman Shirley Collins that the underused skating rink on the second floor of the office building that had been constructed during the second phase would be shut down by May 3.\\"Jackson Square skating rink on thin ice.\\" The Hamilton Spectator, 1986. The city, recognizing the need for ice rinks downtown and public facilities in the square, urged the citizens of Hamilton to use the skating rink in droves and demanded that Yale Properties not make a final decision until they had held discussions with city planners. To combat the announcement from a civilian perspective, a skating instructor started a petition to keep the rink open on March 31, 1986 that, within a day, garnered a hundred signatures.\\"Skating teacher starts petition to keep rink open.\\" The Hamilton Spectator, 1986. Finally, on April 9, the president of Jackson Square announced that the skating rink would turn into a seasonal facility that would open in November and run until March, a decision that still resulted in the loss of the attendants' careers.\\"Mall ice rink reopens in fall.\\" The Hamilton Spectator, 1986. A few months later on July 18, 1986, The Spectator reported that the mall's first restaurant would close permanently by the end of August. Murray's Restaurant, which had been a local favourite for over a decade, was no longer able to sustain itself under the high rents and early closure times. \\"We have to do business between 9 o'clock in the morning and 4:30 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon‚Ä¶Rent was $6,000 a month,\\" said Alfred Wyss, vice-president of Murray's. Soon after the announcement, Dooney's Restaurant ceased business as well.\\"Jackson Square's first restaurant decides to close its doors forever.\\" The Hamilton Spectator, 1986. Suddenly, with an ice rink that lay dormant for most of the year and two seemingly successful and greatly admired restaurants gone, the public was once again forced to examine the super-block's promise for an improved Hamilton and its ability to remain the heart of the city's lifeblood. =Decline= By the end of the 1980s, the world of retail was in a volatile state. The entrance of fast fashion stores into the North American market saturated smaller local and regional brands, causing most of them to close, consolidate or update their marketing profile. At the same time, department stores were losing their grasp on the market as American big-box stores entered Canada and shoppers turned to high-fashion merchants for their clothing purchases.Bourne, L. and D. Ley, 1993. The Changing Social Geography of Canadian Cities. 1st ed. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1993. With Limeridge Mall opening on the Hamilton escarpment in 1981, Jackson Square faced fierce competition from a wheelchair accessible, freeparking, two-storey complex that was host to three successful department stores and various high- end stores paying cheaper rents. It was not long until shoppers, seeing a clear contrast between the two commercial shopping centres, criticized Jackson Square's outdated look, expensive parking, cavernous feel, and barren rooftop plaza. A final sting came on April 27, 1989, when Yale Properties announced that it would close the skating rink and replace it with a daycare centre for the office workers, an idea that never came to full fruition.\\"Jackson Square skating rink gets the axe.\\" The Hamilton Spectator, 1989. By 1994, as high-end chain clothing stores and smaller local boutiques left the mall in quick succession, Jackson Square became a haven for delinquent activity. For example, on March 18, 1994, a gang of teenagers swarmed the clerk at the Economy Drug Store in the Eaton Centre (now The City Centre) attached to the square, and stole $1,500 in cash. General rowdiness and theft were often reported in the mall. It seemed to be a reflection of the state of Hamilton's economic health, which was faltering during the recession that cost the city thousands of manufacturing jobs, a loss of a tax revenue and funds to invest in the downtown community. On June 27, 1996, Le Ch√¢teau and Bianca Nyg√•rd, along with two other stores, announced their departure from the mall. Although this saddened the property owners, various non-profit organizations rejoiced at the availability of new space for their operations, which had represented a thriving use of the space since 1988.DeHart, N., \\"More stores leave Jackson Square.\\" The Hamilton Spectator, 1996 Unfortunately, two months later, in October 1996, the 25 non-profit groups that came to inhabit Jackson Square faced eviction,Herron, S., \\"25 non-profit organizations face eviction from Jackson Square.\\" The Hamilton Spectator, 1996. and engaged in a battle with Yale Properties that ended abruptly on October 10, 1998 with their 30-day notice of eviction.Dunphy, B., \\"Charities lose free mall space.\\" The Hamilton Spectator, 1998. The downsizing of many insurance firms that had once predominated the office complexes of Jackson Square saw a dramatic decrease in their use of space, with the most evident being the locally famous Stelco Tower that held a 69 per cent vacancy rate and a workforce of 303 people, down from zero per cent vacancy and a workforce of 1,697 employees in 1979.\\"Further Proof.\\" The Hamilton Spectator, 1997. The final blow for Jackson Square came in 1997, when the Bank of Montreal announced that it would be leaving its commercial pavilion and moving to its own lot on the corner of Main and Bay Street. Then, two years later, the famous Eaton's department store collapsed and was annexed by The Bay which refused to take over space in the Eaton Centre. With no anchor tenant, few notable and attractive stores, a severely reduced workforce and the exclusion of non-profit groups from the mall, the once-mighty bastion of a revitalized and community-oriented Hamilton ground to a stand-still from which it has yet to fully recover. =A breath of fresh air for a tired square= After the release of the Hamilton Spectator's Code Red study in the Spring of 2010 revealed that the downtown core was a food desert, significantly contributing to the poverty and ill-health of the city's poorest citizens, Manager of the Economic Development Department Glen Norton placed an offer of $650,000 in grants as an incentive for a private grocer to build in the core.\\"Bringing Food Diversity to Jackson Square.\\" The Hamilton Spectator 03 July 2013: Print. On August 16, 2012 the Jackson Square management announced that it would be the home of the new Nations Fresh Foods grocery store in the Spring of 2013, which would take over the mall's western retail portion in the lobby of the Standard Life Centre, and include over seven million dollars in renovations and upgrades without the use of city grants. Opening on July 13, 2013 after a few delays the sleek 55,000-square foot venture impressed invited guests and customers alike. With operating hours between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., seven days a week, the store manages to maintain a steady pedestrian flow in a previously derelict portion of mall and impress its guests with features like large windows etched with the names of various countries, splashes of colour throughout, as well as concrete and wood columns made to look like trees. Tanks in the large live seafood section are packed with lobster, crab, bass and tilapia and outside, water cascades down a glass wall. About 40 per cent of the Hamilton store is prepared food, with offerings including sushi, panini, hoagies, pasta and Chinese barbecue all displayed in a hot and cold buffet lines, that includes fresh seafood and a range of exotic fruits and vegetables. Sixteen aisles of groceries feature everything from laundry detergent to cat food, with spices taking up an entire aisle making sure that every palate and customer is equally satisfied and represented.Ibid. On March 25, 2015 a new and much awaited LCBO was unveiled in the mall. The 5,530 square foot store was placed beside Nations Fresh Foods in the mall's west end and contains over 4,473 square feet of display space, almost double the retail space of the previous cramped LCBO's home since 1997 near the mall's main entrance at King and James. The store, which is the only LCBO outlet in the downtown, features 17-foot high ceilings and holds a selection of over 1,000 products, including 200 local Ontario wines, thus reducing a large quantity of unused retail space in the mall and boosting customer traffic.\\"Experience Hamilton (Tourism Hamilton)\\". Retrieved 2007-04-11. Retailers and amenities Inside the mall are two food courts, the Food Festival and the Market Court. The latter leads to the back-end of the Hamilton Farmer's Market. Many stores, restaurants and a 6 screen movie theatre operated by Landmark Cinemas are included in the mall's inventory. The complex is also connected to the Sheraton Hamilton Hotel, FirstOntario Centre, Hamilton Convention Centre/Ellen Fairclough Building, Hamilton City Centre, and Hamilton Public Library Central Branch. The mall is also equipped with elevators, escalators, public washrooms, a lost & found department and an underground parking lot with a 1300 vehicle capacity and available EV charging stations that can be accessed by two entrance/exits, one on King Street West and the other on Bay Street North.

Background \\"Time Pussy\\" was the third of three stories Asimov wrote for John W. Campbell for a new category of science fiction tall tales in Astounding Science Fiction called \\"Probability Zero\\". Campbell rejected the first two stories, \\"Big Game\\" and \\"First Law\\", but reluctantly accepted \\"Time Pussy\\". Campbell wanted to run the story under a pseudonym, since he wanted to encourage new writers to write \\"Probability Zero\\" stories. Asimov chose the name George E. Dale. The story appeared in the April 1942 issue of Astounding and was reprinted under Asimov's name in the 1972 collection The Early Asimov. Plot summary The unnamed narrator of \\"Time Pussy\\" relates a story he heard as a boy from Old Mac, who had been an asteroid prospector back during the \\"Rush of '37\\". Old Mac tells the narrator about some cat-like animals he knew on Pallas that existed in four dimensions: in addition to the usual spatial dimensions, the Pallan cats \\"stretched somewheres into middle o' next week\\" (and were thus living precursors of Asimov's fictional chemical compound thiotimoline). The \\"time pussies\\" would howl twenty-four hours before seeing a burglar, and digest their meals three hours before eating them. Old Mac tells how some scientists back on Earth were willing to pay a million dollars for the preserved remains of a time pussy, but the animals would decay too quickly after death to be useful. The miners finally came up with the idea of soaking a time pussy in water just before it died, then quickly freezing the water. However, the attempt to preserve the last time pussy failed, because the water froze so quickly it was still warm.

SPCA closed its Mooroopna processing plant in 2011. It sold its Kyabram factory in 2019. It was owned by Coca-Cola Amatil from 2005 until 2019. History SPC Australia was formed in 2002 by the merger of the for Shepparton Preserving Company (SPC) and Ardmona. SPC was incorporated as a public listed company in 1912, and Ardmona opened in 1921. SPC Ardmona was bought by Coca-Cola Amatil in 2005 for . It sold it in 2019 for to Shepparton Partners Collective. In that time, CCA had also invested about in infrastructure, and the Victorian government had provided in co- investment. SPC Australia carries the SPC, Goulburn Valley and Ardmona brands. It acquired IXL and Taylors brands in 2004, and sold both brands with the Kyabram factory in 2019 to a group of farmers and growers in the Goulburn Valley. Financial problems In October 2013, the company sought financial assistance from the Federal and Victorian governments to modernise it operation. SPCA requested 50 million, including 25 million pledged by the then prime minister, Kevin Rudd, four days before the 2013 federal election. It wanted the Victorian Government to match the Federal grant. SPCA lost $25 million in 2013, compared to a $70 million profit 8 years earlier. In 2012, SPCA disposed $100 million of fruit bought under contract because it could not be sold, blaming it on \\"plummeting\\" local and export orders. A former Coca- Cola Asia executive, Peter Kelly, went to the company in April 2013 to attempt to turn it around. In early 2014, SPCA sought $25 million of government assistance as part of a plan to upgrade the Shepparton cannery. The proposal was later rejected by the Abbott Government. Shortly afterwards however, the Victorian Government announced that $22 million would be provided. In November 2016, Woolworths ended its contract with SPCA for the supply of tinned tomatoes and would not renew it. However, the five-year deal to provide tinned fruit was ongoing. = Turnaround = In March 2014, SPCA signed a deal with Woolworths to supply an extra of local product, worth $70 million, over five years. They will supply Woolworths with beans, canned tomato soups and all its home brand fruit. Peter Kelly, SPCA managing director, said that Australian consumers were buying more fruit in response to the company's problems, with sales in the first 2 months of 2014 up by 60% at Woolworths alone. In June 2019, it was announced that Coca-Cola Amatil had sold the SPC business to a group called Shepparton Partners Collective, for $40 million. Shepparton Partners Collective is a joint venture between Perma Funds Management, a boutique investment house, and The Eights, a private equity firm. The sale was subject to a four-year deferred payment which, subject to business performance, could generate a further $15 million for Coca-Cola on top of the money paid up-front. SPC Football Club The SPC Football Club won the 1945 Goulburn Valley Football Association - Lightening Premiership which was held on the KIng's Birthday public holiday. SPC were runners up to Shepparton East in the 1945 Goulburn Valley Football Association grand final. SPC defeated Numurkah in the 1948 Central Goulburn Valley Football League's seconds grand final. and in 1949 SPC were defeated by Shepparton in the 1949 Central Goulburn Valley Football League's senior football grand final. SPC merged with Shepparton East in 1950 to form City United, later named the Shepparton United Football Club and entered a senior team in Goulburn Valley Football League.

It was established in the early 1900s as a railway support town for the 200 or so sheep farming families on the train-line extending west across the Nullarbor Plain to Western Australia. It played a significant role in the construction of the Trans-Australian Railway. History The Kingoonya Post Office first opened around 1884, closed in 1892, reopened in 1915 after the arrival of the railway and finally closed in 1982. When railway services were rationalised in the early 1990s, Kingoonya was almost abandoned. The few remaining houses in the township are only intermittently occupied by people involved in mining exploration and kangaroo shooting. The Public House is still operating and offers limited accommodation and food. The township is also often used by off- roaders taking the permissible dirt tracks West towards Tarcoola or South past Lakes Everard and Gairdiner and the track to the Highway across the Nullarbor Plain. There are reputed to be small deposits of black opal in the area, following the 1968 discovery of a rare Black Rainbow Opal in a roadside pit off the main street by a six-year-old child. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the town had a viable population of 20 railroad workers' families and several sheep and cattle farming ventures in the surrounding plains. The town has succumbed to salt-water level damage and the former sweet-water springs that supplied the town and farms have long-since disappeared. Native indigenous Australian occupation of the area was evident for all of its recorded history with the Taylor Family Clan prominent in the area throughout the 1940s to 1990s, when they were \\"relocated\\" to government-provided accommodation near Tarcoola and elsewhere. The tragic and enduring stories told by their Clan Elders tell of a time where they were literally treated as vermin and often shot on sight by local farmers and Kangaroo shooters alike before 1963. The fact of which still causes much animosity to the families of those involved. (Interview in 2009 with Elder 'Billy' Taylor). Kingoonya was one of the towns that was, to some small extent, affected by the Australian Government's nuclear tests in the 1950s at Maralinga, when local indigenous people were forced off their traditional hunting lands. Some settled for a decade or so a few kilometres North of Kingoonya in a makeshift hut settlement, where they subsisted badly off the land and what little money they obtained from making and selling aboriginal artwork in the form of throwing spears, woomeras and throwing sticks to the locals once every two weeks when the Tea & Sugar Train pulled in to town. For many years the township relied on the Tea and Sugar train for the weekly provision of supplies. The Indian Pacific (running between Sydney and Perth) and The Ghan (running between Adelaide, Alice Springs and Darwin) trains still pass Kingoonya but do not stop, and to do the twice-weekly mail run; both trains pass the town twice a week in each direction. The township is reputed to have had the widest main street in Australia and cricket matches have been played on it. As of 2007, the town's hotel is still running. The town was featured on Australia Live, a four-hour broadcast on 1 January 1988 to celebrate Australia's bicentennial year. Governance Kingoonya is located within the federal Division of Grey, the state electoral district of Giles, the Pastoral Unincorporated Area of South Australia and the state‚Äôs Far North region. In the absence of a local government authority, the community in Kingoonya receives municipal services from a state government agency, the Outback Communities Authority.

More specifically, e-agriculture involves the conceptualization, design, development, evaluation and application of innovative ways to use information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the rural domain, with a primary focus on agriculture.e-Agriculture Community of Practice ICT includes devices, networks, mobiles, services and applications; these range from innovative Internet-era technologies and sensors to other pre-existing aids such as fixed telephones, televisions, radios and satellites. Provisions of standards, norms, methodologies, and tools as well as development of individual and institutional capacities, and policy support are all key components of e-agriculture. Many ICT in agriculture or e-agriculture interventions have been developed and tested around the world to help agriculturists improve their livelihoods through increased agricultural productivity and income, or by reducing risks. Some useful resources for learning about e-agriculture in practice are the World Bank's e-sourcebook ICT in agriculture ‚Äì connecting smallholder farmers to knowledge, networks and institutions (2011), ICT uses for inclusive value chains (2013), ICT uses for inclusive value chains (2013) and Success stories on information and communication technologies for agriculture and rural development have documented many cases of use of ICT in agriculture. Wireless technologies Wireless technologies have numerous applications in agriculture. One major usage is the simplification of closed- circuit television camera systems; the use of wireless communications eliminates the need for the installation of coaxial cables.  Global Positioning System (GPS)  GPS Receivers In agriculture, the use of the Global Positioning System provides benefits in geo-fencing, map-making and surveying. GPS receivers dropped in price over the years, making it more popular for civilian use. With the use of GPS, civilians can produce simple yet highly accurate digitized map without the help of a professional cartographer. In Kenya, for example, the solution to prevent an elephant bull from wandering into farms and destroying precious crops was to tag the elephant with a device that sends a text message when it crosses a geo-fence. Using the technology of SMS and GPS, the elephant can roam freely and the authorities are alerted whenever it is near the farm. Geographic information systems Geographic information systems, or GiS, are extensively used in agriculture, especially in precision farming. Land is mapped digitally, and pertinent geodetic data such as topography and contours are combined with other statistical data for easier analysis of the soil. GIS is used in decision making such as what to plant and where to plant using historical data and sampling. Computer-controlled devices (automated systems) DeLaval milking station Automatic milking systems are computer controlled stand alone systems that milk the dairy cattle without human labor. The complete automation of the milking process is controlled by an agricultural robot, a complex herd management software, and specialized computers. Automatic milking eliminates the farmer from the actual milking process, allowing for more time for supervision of the farm and the herd. Farmers can also improve herd management by using the data gathered by the computer. By analyzing the effect of various animal feeds on milk yield, farmers may adjust accordingly to obtain optimal milk yields. Since the data is available down to individual level, each cow may be tracked and examined, and the farmer may be alerted when there are unusual changes that could mean sickness or injuries. Smartphone mobile apps in agriculture  The use of mobile technologies as a tool of intervention in agriculture is becoming increasingly popular. Smartphone penetration enhances the multi-dimensional positive impact on sustainable poverty reduction and identify accessibility as the main challenge in harnessing the full potential (Silarszky et al., 2008) in agricultural space. The reach of smartphone even in rural areas extended the ICT services beyond simple voice or text messages. Several smartphone apps are available for agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry and farm machinery. RFID for Animal identification Swiss cow ear with eartag and RFID RFID tags for animals represent one of the oldest uses of RFID. Originally meant for large ranches and rough terrain, since the outbreak of mad-cow disease, RFID has become crucial in animal identification management. An implantable RFID tag or transponder can also be used for animal identification. The transponders are better known as PIT (Passive Integrated Transponder) tags, passive RFID, or \\"chips\\" on animals.*USDA Bets the Farm on Animal ID Program The Canadian Cattle Identification Agency began using RFID tags as a replacement for barcode tags. Currently CCIA tags are used in Wisconsin and by United States farmers on a voluntary basis. The USDA is currently developing its own program. RFID tags are required for all cattle sold in Australia and in some states, sheep and goats as well. The Veterinary Department of Malaysia's Ministry of Agriculture introduced a livestock-tracking program in 2009 to track the estimated 80,000 cattle all across the country. Each cattle is tagged with the use of RFID technology for easier identification, providing access to relevant data such as: bearer's location, name of breeder, origin of livestock, sex, and dates of movement. This program is the first of its kind in Asia, and is expected to increase the competitiveness of Malaysian livestock industry in international markets by satisfying the regulatory requirements of importing countries like United States, Europe and Middle East. Tracking by RFID will also help producers meet the dietary standards by the halal market. The program will also provide improvements in controlling disease outbreaks in livestock. RFID tags have also been proposed as a means of monitoring animal health. One study involved using RFID to track drinking behavior in pigs as an indicator of overall health.

History In 2008, the United Nations referred to e-agriculture as \\"an emerging field\\", with the expectation that its scope would change and evolve as our understanding of the area grows. = ICT in support of rural poverty elimination and food security = In August 2003, the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) joined together in a collaborative research project to look at bringing together livelihoods thinking with concepts from information and communication for development, in order to improve understanding of the role and importance of information and communication in support of rural livelihoods. The policy recommendations included: * Building on existing systems, while encouraging integration of different technologies and information sharing * Determining who should pay, through consensus and based on a thorough analysis of the costs * Ensuring equitable access to marginalised groups and those in the agricultural sector * Promoting localised content, with decentralised and locally owned processes * Building capacity, through provision of training packages and maintaining a choice of information sources * Using realistic technologies, that are suitable within the existing infrastructure * Building knowledge partnerships to ensure that knowledge gaps are filled and a two-way flow of information allows knowledge to originate from all levels of the network and community. The importance of ICT is also recognized in the 8th Millennium Development Goal, with the target to \\"...make available the benefits of new technologies, especially information and communications technologies (ICTs)\\" to the fight against poverty. =WSIS process= E-agriculture is one of the action lines identified in the declaration and plan of action (2003) of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS). The \\"Tunis Agenda for the Information Society\\", published on 18 November 2005, emphasizes the leading facilitating roles that UN agencies need to play in the implementation of the Geneva Plan of Action. FAO hosted the first e-agriculture workshop in June 2006, bringing together representatives of leading development organizations involved in agriculture. The meeting served to initiate development of an effective process to engage as wide a range of stakeholders involved in e-agriculture, and resulted in the formation of the e-Agriculture Community, a community of practice. The e-Agriculture Community's Founding Partners include: Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR); Technical Centre for Agriculture and Rural Development (CTA); FAO; Global Alliance for Information and Communication Technologies and Development (GAID); Global Forum on Agricultural Research (GFAR); Global Knowledge Partnership (GKP); Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (now called Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit, GIZ); International Association of Agricultural Information Specialists (IAALD); Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA); International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); International Centre for Communication for Development (IICD); United States National Agricultural Library (NAL); United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA); the World Bank.

Family  Teresa was the illegitimate daughter of Theresa, Countess of Portugal, and Fernando P√©rez de Traba, Lord of Trastamara. She was already married to Count Nu√±o P√©rez de Lara in 1152 when both ceded Castronu√±o to its inhabitants and established its borders, maintaining certain rights over the village after King Alfonso VII of Le√≥n and Castile donated it in 1156 or 1157 to the Knights Hospitaller. On 29 January 1160 Teresa and husband Nu√±o founded the Cistercian convent of Santa Mar√≠a at Perales, donating to Ozenda, the first abbess, all their properties in Perales and Zorita. In 1174, they gave the bishop of Burgos the village of Barchilona in exchange for all the rights and properties of the hospital in Puente de Fitero which they had founded and donated to the Knights Hospitaller. Following the death of Nu√±o in 1177, Teresa went to the Leonese court, and there, before 7 October 1178, she married King Ferdinand II of Le√≥n (1137-1188). Thanks to this marriage, her children lived at the court and boasted of being the offspring of a queen of Le√≥n as attested by a charter where her son √Ålvaro making a donation to the Monastery of Sobrado called himself filius comitis domni Nunonis et regine domne Tarasie.

Nearby are the villages of Old, Lamport and Mawsley and the Northampton & Lamport Railway. It is believed that the name Faxton comes from the Scandinavian Fakr and the Anglo-Saxon tun, meaning Fakr's Farm. This would indicate that Faxton grew from a Viking or Norse settler's farmstead and therefore would date from approximately the 9th century The Domesday Book, naming Faxton as the Manor of Fextone, notes that the population was of approximately 60 to 80 people. The village is documented as having consisted of a church, a rectory, a hall, an aviary, almshouses and a number of ponds. Lady Danvers founded the parish's almshouses for four persons and, six years later, Jane Kemsey bequeathed ¬£100 to it.A Topographical Dictionary of England, (1848) Archaeological evidence has been found of settlement at Faxton as early as around 1200.Brian Holden (2008). Faxton The Lost Village. Solihull: Roseworld Productions Ltd. p. 84 It has been said that in an attempt to escape the plague in London in 1665, a family relocated to Faxton with their servants, one of whom carried the fatal disease which spread and almost wiped out the village. However, this tale is disproved by comparing the number of householders recorded in the hearth tax lists for Faxton in years before and after that date. 30 householders were listed in 1662,The National Archives: E179/254/11 but 34 were recorded for the year ending 25 March 1674.The National Archives: E179/254/14 Former residents have recalled that Faxton could only be reached by horse-drawn vehicles, as none of the roads leading to it were made up to accommodate motor vehicles; they considered that to be a major factor in the decline of the village.Brian Holden (2008). Faxton The Lost Village. Solihull: Roseworld Productions Ltd. p. 116 The parish church of St Denis suffered extensive vandalism during the early 20th century. It ceased to be used for public worship in 1939 and was demolished in 1958.Brian Holden (2008). Faxton The Lost Village. Solihull: Roseworld Productions Ltd. pp. 49-59 There is now just one house standing on this remote hilltop location, overlooking the rolling farmland. The Northamptonshire Record Office holds the christening, marriage and burial registers for the parish. Sir Augustine Nichols (1559-1616) Monument to Sir Augustine Nicolls, now at the Victoria and Albert Museum Faxton's most famous resident was Sir Augustine Nichols, a judge of the Court of Common Pleas under James I of England. He was a Knight of the Bath, born in Faxton in 1559; he died in 1616. In 1610, the Manor of Kibworth, Leicestershire was jointly granted to Augustine, Anthony Shugborough and John Smith after Ambrose Dudley, the Earl of Warwick, died without an heir.A History of the County of Leicestershire: Volume 5: Gartree Hundred (1964) It is not clear what happened to the manor immediately after this, but by 1632 the manor was being held by the Berrige family. Judge Nichols had a clerk working for him. He was Thomas Dudley, a relation of the Nichols family. In 1627 Thomas Dudley, with his wife, daughter Anne, and her husband Simon Bradstreet, sailed for America. Dudley became Governor of Massachusetts as did Bradstreet later. Anne Bradstreet became America's first female poet and is still thought to be one of its finest. Her poem To my dear and loving husband was set to music by Leonard Bernstein and performed at the inauguration of President Jimmy Carter. A memorial to Augustine was positioned inside the parish church but it was smashed during the church's demolition in 1958. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London retrieved the pieces and spent three years restoring it to its former splendour. A legend is connected to the smashed memorial. It is claimed that a phantom, reputed to be that of Sir Augustine, has been seen since the demise of the church and his memorial. Judge Nichols was poisoned in 1616 by four women. They were related to a man who was to appear before Judge Nichols for murder. They thought that by killing the judge they could spare their relation from execution.

It also organizes all youths to be actively involved in production, construction, and military service. The KSYL plays the important role of restricting any form of opposition groups or actions among the youth of North Korea\\", according to Ken E. Gause.

Richeux became a theatrical proprietor, leasing the Ramsgate Victoria Pavilion from 1906, while Agnes Richeux leased the Artillery Theatre, Woolwich, from 1909. After Richeux's death, his widow married, in 1914, the theatre manager Frank Rolison Littler (1879‚Äì1940), who adopted the five children, all of whom took his surname.Morley, Sheridan, \\"Littler, Prince Frank (1901‚Äì1973)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, online edition, October 2009, retrieved 5 August 2014 The younger son Emile, and one of the daughters, Blanche, also went into theatrical management. With Blanche, Littler started a theatrical career in 1927, assembling small companies for provincial tours. After a stint as resident manager of his parents' theatre in Woolwich, he became an independent theatre owner in 1931, buying two theatres in Leicester. The following year he married a widow, Annie Leonora Maclachlan, an actress, professionally known as Norah Delaney. There were no children of the marriage. Over the following years he bought theatres in Manchester and Norwich. His first London productions were pantomimes at the Coliseum, the Prince's, and Drury Lane.\\"Mr Prince Littler\\", The Times, 14 September 1973, p. 18 Littler's West End shows included Glamorous Night (1936), Brigadoon (1950); Carousel, (1951); Guys and Dolls (1953, Can-Can (1954), The Black and White Minstrel Show and Fiddler on the Roof (both 1966). He presented more than 200 pantomimes in the regions, but unlike his younger brother, Emile, he played no part in writing any of his pantomimes, and concentrated wholly on the business side of the theatre. Littler was chairman and managing director of three major theatre groups, chairman of a fourth (Moss Empires). From the beginning of commercial television in the UK, he was a major shareholder in Associated Television. He was a member of the council of the Theatrical Managers' Association, and vice-president of the boards of the Society of West End Theatre Managers, Denville Home for Aged Actors and Actresses and the Variety Artistes' Benevolent Fund. He served on the boards of the South Bank Theatre and the Royal Opera House.

This draws ridicule from the other instruments, and Tubby runs off crying to a nearby creek. A frog who lives there consoles Tubby; both are treated poorly, as neither is thought to be capable or worthy of a solo. The frog teaches Tubby a melody and the two part ways. The next day, at the warmup, Tubby begins playing his newly learned melody. The orchestral instruments are shocked, but are encouraged to let the tuba have his solo by their conductor.

She founded the Monastery of Santa Mar√≠a la Real in Vile√±a where she retired and received burial.  Biography  Urraca was first married with her mother's kinsman the Galician magnate Nu√±o Mel√©ndez (c. 1180) son of Melendo N√∫√±ez and Mar√≠a Fr√≥ilaz. Around 1182, she became the mistress of king Fernando after the death of his second wife, Teresa Fern√°ndez de Traba. They were married a few years later in May 1187 and the king gave her several properties in Aguilar and Monteagudo. Aware that her husband was nearing the end of his life, she attempted to have their only surviving son, Sancho, declared heir to the throne against the interests of Alfonso, later crowned as Alfonso IX of Le√≥n, son of King Fernando and his first wife Urraca of Portugal. She argued that infante Alfonso was illegitimate since his parent's marriage had been annulled due to their consanguinity. King Fernando apparently banished his son Sancho from the court, considered a triumph for Urraca. King Fernando died in Benavente on 22 January 1188 and was succeeded by his first-born, Alfonso IX of Le√≥n after which, Urraca had to seek refuge in the Castile ruled by her former husband's nephew, Alfonso VIII, entrusting the protection of her holdings in Le√≥n to her brother Diego L√≥pez II de Haro. Nevertheless, Alfonso IX of Le√≥n, concerned about the power of the Haro family, reached an agreement with King Alfonso VIII of Castile and attacked the fortresses owned by Urraca in the Kingdom of Le√≥n. Altarpiece of the disappeared Monastery of Santa Mar√≠a la Real in Vile√±a kept at the Burgos Museum.In 1213, count √Ålvaro N√∫√±ez de Lara, married to Queen Urraca's niece, Urraca D√≠az de Haro gave her several properties in La Bureba, with which she later founded, in 1222, the Monastery of Santa Mar√≠a la Real in Vile√±a, entrusting its governance to the Cistercians. Although she was not the abbess of this monastery, she became a nun and was buried in a sepulcher made of stone placed in the presbytery of the church at the monastery that was transferred subsequently to the Museum in Vile√±a after the monastery was destroyed by fire in 1970 and then again to the Museum of Burgos. Queen Urraca has been mistakenly identified as the abbess at the monastery of Ca√±as. Nevertheless, as demonstrated in contemporary sources, it was her niece, Urraca D√≠az de Haro who was actually the abbess at that monastery.  Urraca in contemporary sources  Urraca appears frequently in Medieval sources: * In August 1183, King Fernando II donated land in Villamor, Bur√≥n, and Oma√±a to Urraca. * On 1 July 1190, Alfonso VIII of Castile gave Urraca the towns de Vile√±a, La Vid de Bureba, and Villaprovedo, plus royal properties in Besga and in Pedralada. * On 2 February 1194, queen Urraca confirmed to the Monastery of San Salvador de O√±a its ownership of the hills of Piedralada granted a year earlier to the Monastery by Alfonso VIII of Castile stating that she was doing it pro amore de domno Didaco meo fratre. This donation was confirmed by her son Sancho and by her brother Diego. * In 1195, Queen Urraca with her children Sancho and Mar√≠a N√∫√±ez made a donation of land in Mahude. * On 15 April 1222, as the widow of Fernando II, for her soul and that of her children, she donated all her properties in Vile√±a and in another twelve localities to the nuns at the Abbey of Santa Mar√≠a la Real de Las Huelgas, incorporating these properties to her previous donation for the founding of the monastery in Vile√±a where Elvira Garc√≠a would be the first abbess. * On 10 May 1224, Pope Honorius III issued a document addressed to Queen Urraca \\"already a nun in this monastery\\" and to the religious community, taking it and the vassals of La Vid and Villaprovedo under his protection. This is the last time that she is mentioned at this monastery.  Marriages and issue  She had a daughter with her first husband, Nu√±o Mel√©ndez: * Mar√≠a N√∫√±ez (died in 1255) who appears with her mother and her half-brother Sancho in 1195 making a donation to the Monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Trianos. Although she was not the abbess, Mar√≠a was the temporary administrator of the monastery in Vile√±a founded by her mother. She had two sons with King Fernando: *Garc√≠a Fern√°ndez, Infante of Le√≥n (1181‚Äì1184) (born before the marriage). *Sancho, Infante of Le√≥n (1186/1187‚Äì1220), who inherited Monteagudo and Aguilar from his mother, married in 1210 Teresa D√≠az de Haro, daughter of Diego L√≥pez II de Haro, Lord of Biscay and Toda P√©rez de Azagra.  Burial  left 200px Queen Urraca was buried, dressed as a nun with her hands folded across her chest, in a stone sepulchre which was previously at the Monastery of Santa Mar√≠a la Real in Vile√±a, Burgos, that she had founded and is now in ruins.

It is located in the northwest of the oblast on the Karelian Isthmus and borders with Priozersky District in the northeast, Vsevolozhsky District in the east, Kurortny District of the federal city of St. Petersburg in the south, Kymenlaakso and South Karelia regions of Finland in the northwest, and Lakhdenpokhsky District of the Republic of Karelia in the north. From the southwest, the district is limited by the Gulf of Finland. The area of the district is . Its administrative center is the town of Vyborg. Population (excluding the administrative center): 113,748 (2002 Census); Geography The district occupies the southwestern part of the Karelian Isthmus. The landscape is hilly and forested, with many rock formations. The northern part of the district lies in the basin of the Vuoksi River, which drains into Lake Ladoga. The Vuoksi itself crosses the district from northwest to southeast. Other rivers in the district, the largest of which are the Gryaznovka and the Sestra, drain directly into the Gulf of Finland. There are many lakes in the district, especially in the basin of the Vuoksi. Lake Glubokoye is the largest one. History The western part of the Karelian Isthmus, inhabited by Karelians and Finns, historically lay between Russia and Sweden (later Russia and Finland) and changed hands on a regular basis. Vyborg was founded in 1293 as a Swedish fortress for protection from the Novgorod Republic. In 1323, the Treaty of N√∂teborg established the border between Novgorod and Sweden along the Sestra River. This border corresponds to the current southern limits of Vyborgsky District. In 1403, Vyborg was chartered. The Novgorod Republic besieged Vyborg in 1411, and the Grand Duchy of Moscow, which by then annexed Novgorod, besieged it in 1495, but on both occasions the fortress was not conquered. According to the Treaty of Stolbovo, the whole Karelian Isthmus was ceded to Sweden and the border moved southeast. In 1710, during the Great Northern War, the troops of Tsar Peter the Great conquered Vyborg, and eventually the whole area was annexed to Russia. This was confirmed by the Treaty of Nystad in 1721. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1719, it became a part of Vyborg Province, and in 1744, Vyborg Governorate with the seat in Vyborg was established. In 1783, it was transformed into Vyborg Viceroyalty, then in 1801 back into Vyborg Governorate. In 1801, Vyborg Governorate was renamed Finland Governorate, and in 1812, it was renamed back and included into the Grand Duchy of Finland, which had previously been ceded to Russia by Sweden. After 1812, it was known as the Viipuri Province. On July 17, 1919, the Viipuri Province became a part of independent Finland. The border between Finland and Soviet Union was drawn along the Sestra River. After the Winter War, Finland ceded this territory to the Soviet Union by the terms of the Moscow Peace Treaty. The territory was recaptured by Finns between 1941 and 1944 during the Continuation War but was again ceded to the Soviets after the Moscow Armistice. The secession was formalized after signing of the Paris Peace Treaty in 1947. Viipuri Province was divided, with the larger part ceded to Soviet Union and the smaller part remaining in Finland. The population was resettled to Finland and replaced by migrants from Central Russia. Vyborgsky District with the administrative center in Vyborg was established in March 1940 as a part of the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Karelian ASSR). On March 31, 1940, the Karelian ASSR was transformed into the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic. On November 24, 1944, Vyborgsky District was transferred from Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic to Leningrad Oblast. Another district established in March 1940 was Yaskinsky District with the administrative center in the work settlement of Yaski (J√§√§ski). It was a part of the Karelian ASSR, and of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic after March 31, 1940. On November 24, 1944, Yaskinsky District was transferred from Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic to Leningrad Oblast. On October 1, 1948, the district was renamed Lesogorsky, and on January 13, 1949, all localities whose names originated in Finnish were renamed using Russian names. In particular, Yaski was renamed Lesogorsky and Enso was renamed Svetogorsk. On December 9, 1960, Lesogorsky District was abolished and merged into Vyborgsky District. On May 16, 1940, Kannelyarvsky District with the administrative center in the selo of Kennelyarvi (Kannelj√§rvi) was established as well. It was a part of Leningrad Oblast. On August 22, 1945, the administrative center of the district was moved from Kennelyarvi to the selo of Rayvola (Raivola) and the district was renamed Rayvolovsky. On October 1, 1948, the district was renamed Roshchinsky, and on January 12, 1949, all localities whose names originated in Finnish were renamed using Russian names. In particular, Rayvola was renamed Roshchino. On July 31, 1959, Roshchino was granted urban-type settlement status. On February 1, 1963, Roshchinsky District was abolished and merged into Vyborgsky District. On May 16, 1940, Rautovsky District with the administrative center in the suburban settlement of Rautu was also established. It was a part of Leningrad Oblast. On October 1, 1948, the district was renamed Sosnovsky and on January 13, 1949, all localities whose names originated in Finnish were renamed using Russian names. In particular, Rautu was renamed Sosnovo. On December 9, 1960, Sosnovsky District was abolished and split between Roshchinsky and Priozersky Districts. Another district established on May 16, 1940 was Koyvistovsky District with the administrative center in the town of Koyvisto (Koivisto). It was a part of Leningrad Oblast. On October 1, 1948, the district was renamed Primorsky and on January 13, 1949, all localities whose names originated in Finnish were renamed using Russian names. In particular, Koyvisto was renamed Primorsk. On April 3, 1954, Primorsky District was abolished and merged into Roshchinsky District. Restricted access A wide stretch of land in the district to the west of the Vyborg‚ÄìKhiytola railway, as well as the islands and shores of the Vyborg Bay, belong to the strictly guarded zone of the border control. In 1993-2006, the zone was formally wide, and was further expanded in 2006. Visiting the zone is forbidden without a permit issued by the Federal Security Service. Economy =Industry= The economy of the district is dominated by timber industry, including several paper mills. Additionally, construction and food industries are present, as well as a shipyard in Vyborg. =Agriculture= The main agricultural specializations in the district are cattle breeding with meat and milk production, poultry breeding with egg production, and fish farming. =Transportation= Vyborg train station A number of railways pass through the district. The main line between St. Petersburg and Helsinki, the Riihim√§ki ‚Äì Saint Petersburg Railway, runs through Vyborg. Another line connecting St. Petersburg and Vyborg follows the coastline of the Gulf of Finland, passing Primorsk. Vyborg is connected to Khiytola via Kamennogorsk. This is the old Vyborg‚ÄìJoensuu railroad. In Kamennogorsk, a railway branches up north to Svetogorsk; its stretch beyond Svetogorsk to the state border is disused. All these railways are served by suburban trains originating from the Finland Station of St. Petersburg and from Vyborg. In addition, there are daily connections between St. Petersburg and Helsinki. The M10 highway which connects Moscow and St. Petersburg with Finland crosses the district and passes Vyborg, where it sharply turns to the west and proceeds to the state border. The road network in the district was mostly constructed when Vyborg region was a part of Finland before 1940 and is sufficiently dense and reliable. In particular, several roads connect Vyborg with St. Petersburg and one of these roads follows the coastline.

It is thought that this castle may have been an inspiration for Mary Shelley when she wrote her 1818 Gothic novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus.  Location  Frankenstein Castle is in southern Hesse, Germany, on the spurs of the Odenwald mountain range at an elevation of close to the southern outskirts of Darmstadt. It is one of many historic castles along the Hessian Bergstra√üe Route, also famous for its vineyards and its mild climate.  Meaning of \\"Frankenstein\\"  Frankenstein is a German name consisting of two words: The Franks are a Germanic tribe and \\"stein\\" is the German word for \\"stone\\". Accordingly, the meaning of Frankenstein is \\"Stone of the Franks\\". The word \\"stein\\" is common in names of landscapes, places and castles in Germany. Consequently, the term \\"Frankenstein\\" is a rather ordinary name for a castle in this region.  History  Frankenstein Castle Chapel The interior of Frankenstein Castle Chapel Before 1250, Lord Conrad II Reiz of Breuberg built Frankenstein Castle and thereafter named himself von und zu Frankenstein. The first document proving the existence of the castle in 1252 bears his name. He was the founder of the free imperial Barony of Frankenstein, which was subject only to the jurisdiction of the emperor, with possessions in Nieder-Beerbach, Darmstadt, Ockstadt, Wetterau and Hesse. Additionally the Frankensteins held other possession and sovereignty rights as burgraves in Zwingenberg (Auerbach (Bensheim)), in Darmstadt, Gro√ü-Gerau, Frankfurt am Main and Bensheim. The hill on which the castle stands was probably occupied by another castle from the 11th century, which fell into ruins after Frankenstein Castle was built a short distance away to the northwest. Claims of an even older predecessor upon the hill are widespread, but historically unlikely. In 1292 the Frankensteins opened the castle to the counts of Katzenelnbogen (County of Katzenelnbogen) KatzenelnbogenThe History of the County of Katzenelnbogen and the First Riesling of the World and formed an alliance with them. In 1363, the castle was split into two parts and owned by two different families of the lords and knights of Frankenstein. At the beginning of the 15th century, the castle was enlarged and modernized. The Frankenstein knights became independent of the counts of Katzenelnbogen again. Being both strong opponents of the reformation and following territorial conflicts, connected disputes with the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt, as well as the adherence to the Roman Catholic faith and the associated \\"right of patronage\\", the family head Lord John I decided to sell the lordship to the Landgraves of Hesse-Darmstadt in 1662, after various lawsuits at the Imperial Chamber Court. The castle was used as refuge and a hospital afterward, falling into ruins in the 18th century. The two towers that are so distinctive today are a historically inaccurate restoration carried out in the mid-19th century. On Halloween night in 1952, John Keel sent three American Forces Network reporters to Frankenstein Castle to explore the castle for a live radio broadcast. The reporters were told that a local legend claimed Frankenstein's monster would return to the castle that night. Reporter Carl Nelson investigated the castle's crypt, where Keel had \\"set up a statue in the middle of the crypt - and rigged it to move and topple\\" as a prank, terrifying Nelson. Reportedly, frightened radio listeners bombarded the station with calls and military police were dispatched to the castle.  Legends and myths  The Odenwald, the mountain range on which Frankenstein Castle is located, is a landscape with dark forests and narrow valleys shrouded in mystery and enshrined in legend. Many folktales and myths exist about Frankenstein Castle. None of them have been verified as fact, but all of them have influenced the culture and traditions of the region. = Alchemist Dippel, Mary Shelley and the monster = In 1673, Johann Conrad Dippel was born in the castle, where he was later engaged as a professional alchemist. It is suggested that Dippel influenced Mary Shelley's fantasy when she wrote her Frankenstein novel, though there is no mention of the castle in Shelley's journals from the time. However, it is known that in 1814, prior to writing the famous novel, Shelley took a journey on the river Rhine. She spent a few hours in the town of Gernsheim, which is located about ten miles away from the castle. Several nonfiction books on the life of Mary Shelley claim Dippel as a possible influence.Hobbler, Dorthy and Thomas. The Monsters: Mary Shelley and the Curse of Frankenstein. Back Bay Books; August 20, 2007Garrett, Martin. Mary Shelley. Oxford University Press, 2002Seymour, Miranda. Mary Shelley. Atlanta, GA: Grove Press, 2002. pg 110-111 Dippel created an animal oil known as Dippel's Oil which was supposed to be equivalent to the \\"elixir of life\\". Dippel attempted to purchase Castle Frankenstein in exchange for his elixir formula, which he claimed he had recently discovered; the offer was turned down.Gothic Immortals: The Fiction of the Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross by Marie Roberts contains a translation of a letter Dippel wrote in which he requested to be the lord of Castle Frankenstein in exchange for the Elixir of Life. There are also rumours that during his stay at Frankenstein Castle, Dippel practiced not only alchemy but also anatomy and may have performed experiments on dead bodies that he exhumed. There are rumours that he dug up bodies and performed medical experiments on them at the castle and that a local cleric would have warned his parish that Dippel had created a monster that was brought to life by a bolt of lightning. (The use of lightning to bring Frankenstein's monster to life comes from the 1931 film and isn't in the novel.) There are local people who still claim today that this actually happened and that this tale was related to Shelley's stepmother by the Brothers Grimm, the German ethnologists.Stars and Stripes Website - Frankenstein Castle: A frightfully nice place for Halloween celebration Retrieved 21 April 2014 However, none of these claims have been proven to this date, and some local researchers doubt any connection between Mary Shelley and Frankenstein Castle.Frankenstein - the monster's home? A sceptical analysis. = Lord George and the Dragon = Frankenstein forest One of the most famous legends is about Lord George and a dragon, by August Nodnagel (1803-1853). It is said that long ago a dangerous dragon lived in the garden near the well at the castle of Burg Frankenstein. The peasants of a neighboring village (Nieder-Beerbach) lived in fear of the mighty dragon. It is said the dragon would creep in at night and eat the villagers and their children in their sleep. One day a knight by the name of Lord George rode into town. The townsfolk were desperate; seeing a brave knight gave them hope, and they poured out their troubles and sorrows as he promised to help them. The next day, he put on his armor and rode up to the castle, into the garden and straight to the well where the dragon was taking a rest in the sun. Lord George got off his horse and attacked the dragon. The dragon fought for his life, puffed and spewed out fire and steam. Hours passed as the two continued to battle. Finally, just as the knight was about to drop from exhaustion, and just as the dragon was going to drop from exhaustion, the knight plunged his sword into the underbelly of the beast and was victorious. But as the dragon struggled in agony, it coiled its tail with the poisonous spine around the knight's belly and stung. Lord George and the dragon both fell. The villagers were so happy and relieved that the dragon was finally slain they wanted to give the knight a proper, honorable burial. They brought him to the Church of Nieder Beerbach, in the valley on the east side of the castle, and gave him a marvelous tomb. To this day, you can still visit and pay your respects to Lord George, the Knight who slew the Dragon in the 1200s.http://www.muehltal- odenwald.de/geschich/nb/kirch-nb.html = Fountain of youth = Fountain of youth - Frankenstein Castle Hidden behind the herb garden of the castle, there is a fountain of youth. Legend is that in the first full-moon night after Walpurgis Night, old women from the nearby villages had to undergo tests of courage. The one who succeeded became rejuvenated to the age she had been on the night of her wedding. It is not known if this tradition is still being practiced these days.Frankenstein on GG-Online Retrieved 19 April 2014 = Gold rush = In the 18th century, a gold rush caused some turmoil near Frankenstein Castle. It is believed that a legend and visions of fortunetellers caused local residents to believe that a treasure was hidden near the castle. In 1763, chaotic scenes took place which even an intervention of a priest from the neighbouring village of Nieder-Beerbach could not stop. Even though no gold-filled vaults were ever found, fortune-hunters did not abandon the digging until one Johann Heinrich Drott was killed when his dig collapsed on him. He was given a suicide's burial. In 1770, 1787 and 1788, further attempts were made, but nothing of any value was found. It was then that local authorities banned further gold-digging.Heinrich Eduard Scriba: \\"Geschichte der ehemaligen Burg und Herrschaft Frankenstein und ihrer Herrn\\" (German), 1853 = Ghost Hunters investigation = Frankenstein Castle gained international attention when the SyFy TV-Show Ghost Hunters International made a whole episode about the castle in 2008 (Episode 107) and claimed it would show \\"significant paranormal activity\\". The investigators met with a Frankenstein expert who guided Robb Demarest, Andy Andrews, Brian Harnois and their colleague through the castle and discussed its legends and paranormal sightings. After discussing their personal experiences, the team used audio and video devices for their investigation. Sounds from the chapel and the entrance tower sounded like words and an ultrasonic recorder picked up signals in the chapel. A recorded sound was identified as a phrase in Old German that means \\"Arbo is here\\", which was interpreted as \\"Arbo\\" probably meaning \\"Arbogast\\", the name of a knight of the castle, announcing his presence and claim over the land. A second sound bite was interpreted to mean \\"come here\\". The team left Frankenstein Castle convinced that there is some sort of paranormal activity going on.SyFy - Ghost Hunters International Website Retrieved 19 April 2014 = Magnetic phenomena near the castle = Magnetic stones at Frankenstein In a remote part of the forest behind Frankenstein Castle on 417 meter high Mount Ilbes, compasses do not work properly due to magnetic stone formations of natural origin. Local nature enthusiasts and witchcraft practitioners are said to perform rituals at these magnetic places on special occasions like Walpurgis Night or summer solstice.GG-Online: Burg Frankenstein Retrieved 20 April 2014 The magnetic stones can be visited by everyone, but it is advisable not to disturb ongoing ritual activities at any means. Legend has it that Mount Ilbes is the second most important meeting place for witches in Germany after Mount Brocken in the Harz. = Regional tales and mysteries = Felsenmeer Lautertal (near Frankenstein) Close to Frankenstein Castle, a large felsenmeer (\\"sea of rocks\\") near the village of Lautertal is assumed to be a major scene of the Nibelungenlied. Allegedly, Siegfried the dragonslayer, on a hunting trip leading him from the Burgundian city of Worms into the Odenwald, was murdered by Hagen of Tronje at the Felsenmeer's Siegfriedsquelle (\\"Siegfried's wellspring\\"). In some stories, the region is connected to the apparition of legendary creatures, like knight George fighting against a man-eating lindworm near Frankenstein Castle or creatures of nature with magic potency (e.g. a water spirit that changed into a fox near Niedernhausen). There is some evidence that even the name of the entire region is a hint to a mystical background: Odenwald means \\"The Woods of Odin\\".  Current use  = Frankenstein Castle as a tourist attraction = Despite being a well-known tourist destination, Frankenstein castle has never been developed into a commercial tourist attraction on a large scale. Local people use the mountain chain on which Frankenstein Castle is located for sport activities like hiking and mountain biking. Normally the castle is open to the public until late at night, on-site parking is possible right at the castle and a restaurant serves food and refreshments. Admission and parking are free except during special occasions like the Halloween festival, when there is a charge for admission. However, there are no further tourist facilities on the site. = Wedding office = Since the year 2000, the chapel at Frankenstein Castle has been in use as a registry office for civil wedding ceremonies handled by the municipality of M√ºhltal.echo-online.de - \\"Vom Stall zum Standesamt\\" (Article in German) Retrieved 20 April 2014 = Halloween at Frankenstein Castle = Frankenstein Castle In 1978, American airmen from the 435th Transportation Squadron stationed at Rhein-Main Air Base started an annual Halloween festival at the castle, which became one of the biggest Halloween festivals in Europe. In 1977, the 440th Signal Battalion organized a 13 km running competition routed along steep forest trails from Cambrai- Fritsch Army Housing Site in Darmstadt to the castle. The Frankenstein Castle Run was held until 2008 when all American forces left Darmstadt. The city of Darmstadt organized a final race in October 2008.http://www.stripes.com/news/monster-run-lives-on-in-darmstadt-1.84030 Frankenstein Castle = Restaurant = A restaurant with a sun terrace, located right below the castle towers, offers regular service as well as special events (e.g., Horror Dinner Nights).  Travel information  The castle is easily accessible via Autobahn A5, exit \\"Darmstadt-Eberstadt\\". The site is 35 km (20 mi) from Frankfurt International Airport.

The financial and operational environment consists of people, processes, and systems working together to support efficient and effective operations. Controls are put in place to address risks within these components. Through continuous monitoring of the operations and controls, weak or poorly designed or implemented controls can be corrected or replaced ‚Äì thus enhancing the organization's operational risk profile. Investors, governments, the public and other stakeholders continue to increase their demands for more effective corporate governance and business transparency. History Continuous monitoring can be traced back to its roots in traditional auditing processes. It goes further than a traditional periodic snapshot audit by putting in place continuous monitoring of transactions and controls so that weak or poorly designed or implemented controls can be corrected or replaced sooner rather than later. Overview Effective corporate governance requires directors and senior management overseeing the organization with a broader and deeper perspective than in the past. Organizations must demonstrate they are not only profitable but also ethical, in compliance with a myriad of regulations, and are addressing sustainability. To be effective, those involved in the organizational governance process must take an enterprise wide view of where the organization has been, where it is and where it could and should be going. This enterprise wide view also must include consideration of the global, national and local economies, the strengths and weaknesses of the organization's culture, and how the organization approaches managing risk. Risk management Managing risk involves actions beyond establishing and communicating policies and procedures at a high level. It includes understanding the need for (and exercising) both qualitative and quantitative judgment at the governance and operational level on a routine basis (including having an effective system of internal control). The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 created new and higher level requirements for organizations to establish effective internal controls and to assure compliance on an ongoing basis. As organizations have set about to institute compliance programs they have learned they must come up with new methods for maintaining that compliance. Continuous monitoring is part of the solution. It can be a key component of carrying out the quantitative judgment part of an organization's overall enterprise risk management. Continuous monitoring is the process and technology used to detect compliance and risk issues associated with an organizations financial and operational activities. It actively identifies, quantifies and reports control failures such as duplicate vendor or customer records, duplicate payments, and transactions that fall outside of approved parameters. A by-product of continuous monitoring is it highlights opportunities to improve operational processes. Potential benefits Timely identification of problems or weaknesses and quick corrective action can help reduce the cost of any required periodic financial, regulatory, and operational reviews to a reasonable level. A Financial Executives International (FEI) March 2005 survey indicated it could cost an average of $4.36 million for a company to test for and ensure year-one compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404. Continuous monitoring typically includes solutions that address the three operational disciplines known as * continuous audit * continuous controls monitoring * continuous transaction inspection Continuous monitoring systems can examine 100% of transactions and data processed in different applications and databases. The continuous monitoring systems can test for inconsistencies, duplication, errors, policy violations, missing approvals, incomplete data, dollar or volume limit errors, or other possible breakdowns in internal controls. Testing can be done for processes like payroll, sales order processing, purchasing and payables processing including travel and entertainment expenses and purchasing cards, and inventory transactions.

In 1969 she became the second woman to be placed on the list of FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. Originally sentenced to death for the murder of Vivian Ritter, a legal secretary who worked in Leesburg, Florida for a public defender who unsuccessfully represented her two children on felony charges, Arrington escaped from prison in 1969 while awaiting execution by cutting through a window screen and fleeing in her pajamas. After she was caught, she was sentenced in 1972 to 10 additional years for escape, but her death sentence was commuted to life in prison when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down capital punishment as unconstitutional in Furman v. Georgia (1972).Erica Rodriguez, Notorious Leesburg murderess Marie Arrington dead at 80, Orlando Sentinel (June 29, 2014). Arrington died on May 10, 2014 in Lowell Correctional Institution in Marion County, Florida, the same institution from which she escaped. She was 80 years old.  Murder of Jack Arrington  Arrington's first conviction occurred in 1964, for the killing of her husband Lester ‚ÄúJack‚Äù Arrington. Jack, 34, was a former policeman and a bouncer at a nightclub in Miami. Jack was killed on July 4, 1964 on Bethune Beach. Arrington turned herself in the following day, confessing to shooting her husband. During the trial Arrington claimed that the shooting was an accident while her lawyer claimed self-defense, as Jack had become violent with her while the two were arguing in their car. This resulted in her shooting him. Nathaniel Powers, a witness at the scene, told police that he broke the couple up after he saw Jack choking her in the front seat of the car. As the police were unable to locate the weapon Arrington was found guilty of manslaughter instead of more severe charges and sentenced to twenty years in prison. Arrington would later admit in a 2012 interview that she had buried the gun with her husband.  Murder of Vivian Ritter  Arrington had two children, a son and daughter. In 1967 her son, Lloyd Dean, robbed a gas station with a friend in Leesburg, Florida. No one was hurt and $60 was stolen. Her son was represented by public attorney Bob Pierce, who advised him to plead guilty. Dean was sentenced to life in prison in 1968 at the age of 18, while his friend only received probation. Pierce had also represented Arrington's daughter on unrelated fraud charges, which resulted in the daughter receiving jail time as well. This enraged Arrington, who felt that Pierce did not fairly represent Dean. On April 22, 1968, while out on an appeal bond for her manslaughter conviction, Arrington went to Pierce‚Äôs office in Leesburg with the intention of killing him. Once there she discovered that Pierce was not at his office. Arrington then abducted his secretary, Vivian Ritter, which raised tensions within the town. Searches were conducted for Ritter and a psychic was consulted to help find the secretary. Her car was discovered two days after her disappearance, bloodstained. The body of Ritter, who had three children, was found three days later in the woods near State road 44, several miles away from Leesburg. She had been shot and run over with her own car repeatedly. Prior to her capture Arrington burgled the home of Judge Troy Hall, who had given her son his life sentence. When she was captured investigators discovered several notes in her room and in her clothing. The notes threatened to kill the wife of Hall and to dismember Ritter if law officers did not back off and release her children from jail. = Trial and conviction = During the trial multiple witnesses testified against Arrington, linking her to the crime. A taxi driver reported dropping off Arrington half a block away from Pierce's office on the morning of April 22. Arrington's landlady stated that she had lent her a .22 caliber which was never returned to her and was later found to be the gun used to kill Ritter. On December 6, 1968 Arrington was sentenced to death by electric chair for first degree murder.  Escape and later life  On March 1, 1969, Arrington escaped from Florida Correctional Institution in her pajamas by cutting a window screen and jumping out. In May of 1969 she was placed on the FBI‚Äôs 10 Most Wanted List, making her the second woman to ever be placed on the list. Arrington wasn‚Äôt captured until three years later in March of 1972. She fled to New Orleans and worked as a waitress. Arrington later described the feeling of being wanted as sounding like \\"the old wild wild West and the Jesse James Gang\\" and noted that reading newspapers about her being wanted dead or alive and the reward was entertaining. For her escape Arrington was given an additional 10 years. Her death sentence was commuted to life in prison during August of 1972, when the US Supreme Court declared capital punishment as unconstitutional.

P. Youschkevitch and B. A. Rosenfeld. \\"al-KƒÅshƒ´ (al-KƒÅshƒÅnƒ´), GhiyƒÅth al-Dƒ´n Jamshƒ´d Mas ø≈´d\\" Dictionary of Scientific Biography. ( GhiyƒÅs-ud-dƒ´n Jamshƒ´d KƒÅshƒÅnƒ´) (c. 1380 Kashan, Iran ‚Äì 22 June 1429 Samarkand, Transoxania) was a Persian astronomer and mathematician during the reign of Tamerlane. Much of al-KƒÅshƒ´'s work was not brought to Europe, and still, even the extant work, remains unpublished in any form. iranicaonline.org Biography right Theorem of Al-Kashi Al-Kashi was one of the best mathematicians in the history of Iran. He was born in 1380, in Kashan, in central Iran. This region was controlled by Tamerlane, better known as Timur. The situation changed for the better when Timur died in 1405, and his son, Shah Rokh, ascended into power. Shah Rokh and his wife, Goharshad, a Turkish princess, were very interested in the sciences, and they encouraged their court to study the various fields in great depth. Consequently, the period of their power became one of many scholarly accomplishments. This was the perfect environment for al-Kashi to begin his career as one of the world's greatest mathematicians. Eight years after he came into power in 1409, their son, Ulugh Beg, founded an institute in Samarkand which soon became a prominent university. Students from all over the Middle East, and beyond, flocked to this academy in the capital city of Ulugh Beg's empire. Consequently, Ulugh Beg gathered many great mathematicians and scientists of the Middle East. In 1414, al-Kashi took this opportunity to contribute vast amounts of knowledge to his people. His best work was done in the court of Ulugh Beg. Al-Kashi was still working on his book, called ‚ÄúRisala al-watar wa‚Äôl-jaib‚Äù meaning ‚ÄúThe Treatise on the Chord and Sine‚Äù, when he died, probably in 1429. Some scholars believe that Ulugh Beg may have ordered his murder, because he went against Islamic theologians. Astronomy =Khaqani Zij= Al-Kashi produced a Zij entitled the Khaqani Zij, which was based on Nasir al-Din al-Tusi's earlier Zij-i Ilkhani. In his Khaqani Zij, al- Kashi thanks the Timurid sultan and mathematician-astronomer Ulugh Beg, who invited al-Kashi to work at his observatory (see Islamic astronomy) and his university (see Madrasah) which taught theology. Al-Kashi produced sine tables to four sexagesimal digits (equivalent to eight decimal places) of accuracy for each degree and includes differences for each minute. He also produced tables dealing with transformations between coordinate systems on the celestial sphere, such as the transformation from the ecliptic coordinate system to the equatorial coordinate system. =Astronomical Treatise on the size and distance of heavenly bodies= He wrote the book Sullam al-Sama on the resolution of difficulties met by predecessors in the determination of distances and sizes of heavenly bodies such as the Earth, the Moon, the Sun and the Stars. =Treatise on Astronomical Observational Instruments= In 1416, al-Kashi wrote the Treatise on Astronomical Observational Instruments, which described a variety of different instruments, including the triquetrum and armillary sphere, the equinoctial armillary and solsticial armillary of Mo'ayyeduddin Urdi, the sine and versine instrument of Urdi, the sextant of al-Khujandi, the Fakhri sextant at the Samarqand observatory, a double quadrant Azimuth-altitude instrument he invented, and a small armillary sphere incorporating an alhidade which he invented. Plate of Conjunctions Al- Kashi invented the Plate of Conjunctions, an analog computing instrument used to determine the time of day at which planetary conjunctions will occur, and for performing linear interpolation. Planetary computer Al-Kashi also invented a mechanical planetary computer which he called the Plate of Zones, which could graphically solve a number of planetary problems, including the prediction of the true positions in longitude of the Sun and Moon, and the planets in terms of elliptical orbits; the latitudes of the Sun, Moon, and planets; and the ecliptic of the Sun. The instrument also incorporated an alhidade and ruler. Mathematics =Law of cosines= In French, the law of cosines is named Th√©or√®me d'Al-Kashi (Theorem of Al-Kashi), as al-Kashi was the first to provide an explicit statement of the law of cosines in a form suitable for triangulation. His other work is al-RisƒÅla al-muhƒ´tƒ´yya or \\"The Treatise on the Circumference\\". =The Treatise of Chord and Sine= In The Treatise on the Chord and Sine, al-Kashi computed sin 1¬∞ to nearly as much accuracy as his value for , which was the most accurate approximation of sin 1¬∞ in his time and was not surpassed until Taqi al-Din in the sixteenth century. In algebra and numerical analysis, he developed an iterative method for solving cubic equations, which was not discovered in Europe until centuries later. A method algebraically equivalent to Newton's method was known to his predecessor Sharaf al-Dƒ´n al-T≈´sƒ´. Al-KƒÅshƒ´ improved on this by using a form of Newton's method to solve x^P - N = 0 to find roots of N. In western Europe, a similar method was later described by Henry Briggs in his Trigonometria Britannica, published in 1633. In order to determine sin 1¬∞, al- Kashi discovered the following formula often attributed to Fran√ßois Vi√®te in the sixteenth century: \\\\sin 3 \\\\phi = 3 \\\\sin \\\\phi - 4 \\\\sin^3 \\\\phi\\\\,\\\\\\\\! =The Key to Arithmetic= Computation of 2 In his numerical approximation, he correctly computed 2 to 9 sexagesimal digitsAl-Kashi, author: Adolf P. Youschkevitch, chief editor: Boris A. Rosenfeld, p. 256 in 1424, and he converted this estimate of 2 to 16 decimal places of accuracy.The statement that a quantity is calculated to \\\\scriptstyle n sexagesimal digits implies that the maximal inaccuracy in the calculated value is less than \\\\scriptstyle 59/60^{n+1} + 59/60^{n+2} + \\\\dots = 1/60^n in the decimal system. With \\\\scriptstyle n=9, Al-Kashi has thus calculated \\\\scriptstyle 2\\\\pi with a maximal error less than \\\\scriptstyle 1/60^{9}\\\\approx 9.92\\\\times 10^{-17} < 10^{-16}\\\\,. That is to say, Al-Kashi has calculated \\\\scriptstyle 2\\\\pi exactly up to and including the 16th place after the decimal separator. For \\\\scriptstyle 2\\\\pi expressed exactly up to and including the 18th place after the decimal separator one has: \\\\scriptstyle 6.283\\\\,185\\\\,307\\\\,179\\\\,586\\\\,476. This was far more accurate than the estimates earlier given in Greek mathematics (3 decimal places by Ptolemy, 150 CE), Chinese mathematics (7 decimal places by Zu Chongzhi, 480 AD) or Indian mathematics (11 decimal places by Madhava of Kerala School, c. 14th Century ). The accuracy of al- Kashi's estimate was not surpassed until Ludolph van Ceulen computed 20 decimal places of 180 years later. Al-Kashi's goal was to compute the circle constant so precisely that the circumference of the largest possible circle (ecliptica) could be computed with the highest desirable precision (the diameter of a hair). Decimal fractions In discussing decimal fractions, Struik states that (p. 7):D.J. Struik, A Source Book in Mathematics 1200-1800 (Princeton University Press, New Jersey, 1986). > \\"The introduction of decimal fractions as a common computational practice > can be dated back to the Flemish pamphlet De Thiende, published at Leyden in > 1585, together with a French translation, La Disme, by the Flemish > mathematician Simon Stevin (1548-1620), then settled in the Northern > Netherlands.

The film features an ensemble cast of international actors, including Diego Luna, Samantha Morton, Denis Lavant, Werner Herzog, James Fox, Anita Pallenberg and Leos Carax. Plot A young man living in Paris scratches out a living as a Michael Jackson look-alike, dancing on the streets, public parks, tourist spots and trade shows. During a show in an old people's home, he meets a Marilyn Monroe impersonator. Haunted by her angelic beauty, he follows her to a commune in the Scottish Highlands, joining her husband Charlie Chaplin, and her daughter Shirley Temple. Here, the Pope, Elizabeth II, Madonna, James Dean, and other impersonators build a stage in the hope that the world will visit and watch them perform. A subplot concerns a convent of nuns, in what seems to be a developing country. One of the nuns survives a fall from an airplane during a mission to deliver food to villages, and discovers that if you are true of heart, God will protect you. All the nuns then begin jumping from planes to show they are true of heart and protected by God.

Rather than mocking or belittling impersonation, Korine claims to have felt a \\"fondness and empathy\\" for impersonators since childhood.Bishop, Richard. \\"Harmony Korine\\". BOMB Magazine. Spring 2008. Retrieved 3 August 2011. Korine came up with the idea for the film after the release of Julien Donkey-Boy, but his drug use and general disillusionment (along with fund-raising difficulties) prolonged the process. In a February 2007 interview with Screen International, he said: \\"I'd been making movies since I was virtually a kid, and it had always come very easily. At a certain point after the last movie, I started to have this general disconnect from things. I was really miserable with where I was. I began to lose sight of things and people started to become more and more distant. I was burnt out, movies were what I always loved in life and I started to not care. I went deeper and deeper into a dark place and to be honest movies were the last thing I was thinking about ‚Äì I didn't know if I was going to be alive. My dream was to evaporate. I was unhealthy. Whatever happened during that time, and I won't go into the details, maybe it was something I needed to go through.\\" In a 2003 interview with the New York Post, former girlfriend Chlo√´ Sevigny revealed that the formerly straight edge Korine had become addicted to heroin and methadone while they were together, with Korine's substance abuse issues contributing to the end of their relationship.Harmony-Korine.com . Interviews & Articles Richard Strange, who plays Abraham Lincoln, claimed that Korine often changed scenes and lines as filming progressed. Production While shooting the commune scenes, the cast and crew lived together in a Scottish castle, and many of the actors remained in their impersonated characters for all or part of the time they were off- camera. Actor Denis Lavant even bathed with his shoes on, as his impersonated character Charlie Chaplin was said to do. To film the secondary storyline, Korine worked with real skydiving nuns from Spain, sometimes in temperatures of 48 ¬∞C (120 ¬∞F).

Afterwards, still in the hospital, Malachy appears to Mercedes one last time to tell her that he loves her, signalling that he is truly moving on. Creation Malachy initially appeared in only three episodes, a gruff builder who was appalled to learn his brother was a bisexual cross dresser. Actor Glen Wallace got on well with Gerard McCarthy, as they had known each other since they were teenagers. He said producers were \\"keen\\" on his work and brought him back for another nine episodes to see if he could be integrated into the canvas. After an absence of several months, they gave him a year-long contract. Development A central part of Malachy's character was his discovery in September 2008 that he had HIV. Wallace said he was \\"taken aback\\" when he heard about the story, but felt the storyline was very important, as national TV had not covered the topic since EastEnders character Mark Fowler. He knew many people never believed they could get HIV, and hoped his character's own ignorance might make some of them change their minds. Malachy's main love interest was Mercedes McQueen. Wallace described Mercedes and Malachy as \\"very alike, they are two alpha characters and everything is about them ‚Äì that sounds a bit harsh!\\" Their relationship was jeopardised when he exposed her to HIV, but they married in the final episode of the first series of Hollyoaks Later. In May 2009, Wallace revealed his contract had been extended, which he appreciated, he stated: \\"I think there's a lot more to be got from the HIV storyline and to have someone come in and die off straight away is unrealistic anyway.\\" References External links * Character profile on the E4 website Category:Hollyoaks characters Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Fictional construction workers Category:Fictional characters with HIV/AIDS Category:Television characters introduced in 2007 Category:Male characters in television Category:McQueen family ","title":"Malachy Fisher"},{"id":"10553381","text":"Ankles Aweigh is a musical with a book by Guy Bolton and Eddie Davis, lyrics by Dan Shapiro, and music by Sammy Fain. The plot involves Hollywood starlet Wynne, who secretly marries a Navy pilot while filming a movie in Sicily. She disguises herself as a sailor and stows away on his ship to grab a covert honeymoon. They get mixed up with an espionage ring. The original Broadway production ran for 176 performances in 1955 and lost money. Background and productions By 1955, audiences had become accustomed to book musicals that seamlessly integrated dialogue scenes with musical numbers, so this throwback to vaudeville-style entertainment, complete with burlesque jokes, chorus girls, and impersonations of Marlene Dietrich and Zsa Zsa Gabor, \\"seemed a shockingly dated effort\\", according to Ken Mandelbaum.Mandelbaum, Ken. \\"CDs: Sister Act\\".

The show was directed by Fred F.

The producers immediately posted a closing notice, but theatre owner Anthony Brady Farrell decided to keep the show running with his own financing. Broadway columnists Walter Winchell's and Ed Sullivan's glowing reports failed to generate much business, and when salaries were cut to keep losses to a minimum, most of the major players quit in protest. After struggling for five months, the show finally closed at a loss of $340,000, which was more than its initial investment.

The two participated in robberies at a Massachusetts National Guard armory and a bank in Brighton, Massachusetts where Boston police officer Walter Schroeder was shot and killed. Power remained at large for 23 years. A native of Colorado, Power turned herself over to authorities in 1993 after starting a new life in Oregon. She pleaded guilty and was imprisoned in Massachusetts for six years before being released on 14 years' probation. While in prison, Power completed her bachelor's degree, and after her release, earned a master's degree at Oregon State University. She resides in the Boston area. Early life Katherine Power grew up as the third of seven children in Denver, Colorado. Her parents, Winfield and Marjorie, raised their Irish Catholic middle-class family on Winfield's salary as a bank credit manager and Marjorie's income as a registered nurse. She became a Girl Scout and won a scholarship to Marycrest Girls High School, a Catholic school in Colorado. While in high school, she won a Betty Crocker cooking award, wrote a regular column for the Denver Post, graduated as valedictorian and received a full scholarship to Brandeis University, a liberal arts school in Waltham, Massachusetts. In 1967, Power enrolled at Brandeis as a sociology major and honor student at a time of anti-Vietnam War protests at the school. She became known for wandering the campus braless and barefoot in an orange-colored smock, for her attendance at Students for a Democratic Society protest rallies and for her involvement in the Brandeis Strike Information Center. She and her room-mate Susan Saxe worked to organize student protests for a committee known as the National Student Strike Force. The two also became acquainted with fellow organizer Stanley Ray Bond, an ex-convict and soldier attending classes at the university on a special program. Protest and murder Through their association with Bond, Power and Saxe became involved in a plot to arm the Black Panthers as a response to United States involvement in the Vietnam War. Bond introduced them to former convicts William Gilday and Robert Valeri and together the group plotted to rob the State Street Bank & Trust. On September 20, 1970, the group robbed a National Guard armory in Newburyport, Massachusetts and took 400 rounds of ammunition. They also stole weapons and set fire to the facility, causing about $125,000 in damage. Three days later, on September 23, 1970, the group robbed a bank in Brighton, Massachusetts, carrying handguns, a shotgun and a submachine gun. The first police officer on the scene, Boston police officer Walter Schroeder, was shot in the back by Gilday when he attempted to stop the robbery. He subsequently died from his wounds. The group escaped with $26,000 in cash that they planned to use to finance an overthrow of the federal government. Power was behind the wheel of one of the two getaway vehicles. While raiding her apartment after the bank robbery, police found evidence tying Power to both robberies. This included weapons, ammunition and a telephone switchboard from the armory. Power's attorneys would subsequently blame her involvement in the robberies as the result of manipulation by her partner Bond. Fugitive Gilday, Valeri and Bond were captured shortly after the Brighton robbery. Bond died in custody while making a bomb as part of an escape bid, while Valeri turned state's evidence and testified against Gilday. Valeri received a jail term of 25 years for the robbery, while Gilday received a death sentence. Power and Saxe eluded capture. In November 1970, Power and Saxe became the sixteenth and seventeenth persons on the FBI's Most Wanted Fugitives list. At first, Power and Saxe traveled together, escaping arrest by hiding out in women's communes. For part of this time, the two went to Connecticut and Power assumed the name Mae Kelly. Saxe was able to elude arrest until 1975, when she was captured in Philadelphia. She then served five years in prison. Prior to her surrender in 1993, Power had last been seen in Kentucky in 1974. In 1977, she assumed the alias Alice Louise Metzinger, taking the name from the birth certificate of an infant that had died the year before her birth. In 1979, she moved west to Oregon and gave birth to a son, Jaime, by an unknown father. As time went by, authorities received few tips regarding Power's location and she was eventually removed from the Most Wanted Fugitives list in 1984. The following year, she settled in the city of Lebanon in Oregon's Willamette Valley with her son Jaime and boyfriend Ron Duncan, a local meat cutter and bookkeeper. While living in Oregon, Power taught cooking classes at Linn-Benton Community College in Albany and worked at restaurants in Corvallis and Eugene. She reached the shortlist for the post of food writer for the Corvallis Gazette- Times and became part-owner of Napoli Restaurant and Bakery in Eugene. Power had suffered from clinical depression since childhood and confided her fugitive status to her therapist Linda Carroll. She developed the desire to stop living her life under her assumed name and, through therapy that included participation in the mock trial of a soldier charged with killing civilians during the Vietnam War, she began to prepare for her surrender to the authorities. This included her decision to marry Duncan in 1992 and reveal her background to her friends. Surrender In 1993, Katherine Ann Power negotiated a surrender with authorities and ended 23 years of hiding. Negotiations were carried out through her attorneys Steven Black, a public defender, and Rikki Klieman, a prominent Boston lawyer. On September 15, 1993, she pleaded guilty to two counts of armed robbery and manslaughter in Boston. At the time, her son Jaime was 14 years old and a freshman in high school, while Power was 44 years old. Her husband, Ron Duncan, then adopted Jaime. In court, Power made the following statement about officer Schroeder: Power was sentenced to eight to twelve years in prison for the bank robbery, and five years and a $10,000 fine for the National Guard armory crimes. Additionally, judge Robert Banks of Suffolk County Superior Court imposed a probation condition that Power could not profit from her crime. Banks remarked that the sentence negotiated was inadequate. The second five years were to be served concurrently with the eight- to twelve-year sentence, with a possibility of parole after five years. This probation condition also precluded her ability to profit directly or indirectly from telling her story.Epps, Garrett. Power is free, but not her speech. University of Oregon.

Power appealed this portion of the sentence on First Amendment grounds, but the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court rejected the argument and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari.Power v. Massachusetts, 516 U.S. 1042 (1996). In a 1993 public statement, Power said: Prison and release While in prison, Power completed her college degree in liberal studies through Boston University.Floyd, Mark.

In March 1998, Power was eligible for parole after receiving time off for good behavior but withdrew her request after opposition from the victim's family. On October 2, 1999, she was released from prison in Massachusetts and placed on fourteen years of probation after serving six years of her eight- to twelve-year sentence. Fifty years old at the time of release, Power then returned to Oregon and the family she formed while a fugitive. Shortly after release, she appeared at a public forum on peace at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon, where she questioned the \\"violent posture\\" of some people in the peace movement, including activist Philip Berrigan. Later, Power enrolled in graduate studies at Oregon State University in Corvallis, where she worked on a master's degree in interdisciplinary studies with focuses on writing, philosophy, and ethics. She also taught freshman composition for the English department.Highlights from the 2000‚Äì2001 Annual Report of the OSU Department of Philosophy. Oregon State University. Retrieved on May 14, 2008. On May 10, 2001, she read a poem she wrote called \\"Falling from Darkness\\" in Corvallis (this was also a poetry reading and did also include poems she did not write) and graduated with her MAIS later that year.

Cultural references Since her surrender, Power and her story have been the basis for a variety of books and even a television episode of Law & Order. The episode, entitled White Rabbit, was loosely based on her case. In the show, her character is called Susan Forrest and she is found after money from the robbery turns up in a private safety deposit box after a robbery. William Kunstler appears in the episode playing himself as Forrest's lawyer. The fifth-season episode aired on October 19, 1994.\\"Law & Order\\" White Rabbit (1994). The Internet Movie Database.

Irish Socialist volunteers in the Spanish Civil War describes a grouping of IRA members and Irish Socialists who fought in support the cause of the Second Republic during the Spanish Civil War. These volunteers were taken from both Irish Republican and Unionist political backgrounds but were bonded through a Socialist and anti-clerical political philosophy. Many of the Irish Socialist volunteers who went to Spain later became known as the Connolly Column. Background Following the rejection of the socialist motion put to the IRA Army convention on 17 March 1934 at St. Stephen's Green, Dublin three leading IRA volunteers resigned their duties within the IRA; Frank Ryan, Staff Captain Peadar O'Donnell, and George Gilmore. Then followed a meeting of the Republican Congress, a body composed of the disaffected members of the IRA who wanted Irish Republicanism to focus on achievement of its goals via the political ideals of Socialism. Held in Athlone on April 7 and 8 the focus of the initial meeting was to decide on the direction of the new body and it was decided that an annual Congress should be inaugurated beginning in September 1934.At the Bodenstown Commemoration of 1934 members of the Republican Congress from Shankill Road and Ballymacarrett (then members of the Socialist Party) had attempted to carry a banner which read \\"Wolfe Tone Commemoration 1934 - Shankill Road Belfast Branch\\" but caused scuffles due to the friction between nationalist and socialist outlooks. Following this an IRA court martial took place with former Major-General Se√°n Russell and the Commanding Officers (OC.) of North Tipperary, Clonmel, and the Fourth Dublin Battalion presiding. Former Commandant General Michael Price and O'Donnell were found guilty in absentia on a charge of insubordination and dismissed from the organisation. Bobby Edwards, Ryan, and Gilmore were also court martialed. IRA members who had expressed support for the Congress were effectively \\"stood down\\" from active service in the IRA although they would have retained links to the organisation due to its make up and operational nature. =Republican Congress= Planning for Republican Congress continued, however, with a meeting being held in Rathmines town hall on September 29 -- 30, 1934. From the outset schisms within the newly formed group were apparent. Michael Price, Roddy Connolly and his sister Nora Connolly called for a drive towards a Workers Republic and the formation of a Workers Republican Party. O'Donnell, Ryan, Gilmore, and Edwards put forward a resolution supporting a United Front of the working class and small farmers. The latter resolution was eventually carried by 99 votes to 84.Other prominent members in the O'Donnell/Ryan/Gilmore faction included Seamus MacGowan, Sheila Humphreys, and Eithne Coyle, although Coyle and Humphreys resigned prior to the September Congress due to \\"[verbal] attacks on the IRA\\". The Congress gradually fell apart by 1936 and its significance as a political group passed. It did however provide the framework through which recruitment of IRA volunteers to fight in Spain would take place. Spain With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Peadar O'Donnell and then George Gilmore went to Spain on behalf of the Congress to report on proceedings, and returned enthusiastic supporters of the Spanish Republicans. Ryan was incensed at quasi-Fascist Eoin O'Duffy organising an Irish Brigade to fight with the Fascists, and in open letters to the papers criticised Cardinal MacRory for raising funds at church collections to support Franco.Frank Ryan, by Se√°n Cronin, p. 79. Repsol, 1980 The Congress started publicising the Spanish Republican cause in public meetings. Frank Ryan organized the first transports of Irish volunteers. The first men left Dublin, Belfast, and Rosslare ports in early December 1936 traveling through France and Britain to Spain. =Campaigning= The first Socialist volunteers saw action on the Cordoba front in December 1936. Approximately 135 men fought beside the French IXth Battalion and No.1 Company of the British Battalion. The objective was the town of Lopera and by the time the action was complete it had caused the death of nine in the Irish contingent. They were Frank Conroy (Kildare), Johnny Meehan (Galway), Henry Boner, Jim Foley, Tony Fox, Leo Green, Michael Nolan, Michael May, Tommy Woods (Dublin). Training for the Socialist volunteers took place at Madrigueras (Albacete) alongside troops from the British Battalion. The two groups were not amalgamated, and the Irish contingent was shortly moved to a base in the town of Villanueva de la Jara in January 1937 and part of the Irish voted to move over to the American Abraham Lincoln Battalion. The next engagement the Irish were involved in was the Battle of Jarama following Franco's advance into the Jarama Valley in February 1937. Other campaigns the volunteers were involved included the 1938 advance on Gandesa and the decisive Battle of Ebro where they fought as part of the XV Brigade. =Demobilization= On demobilization of Republican forces the Irish contingent marched to Marsa, later Els Guiamets, and then the demobilization center in Ripoll. Motivations Other factors outside of anti-fascist political conviction and the charismatic urging of Ryan and O'Donnell cited by volunteers for fighting in Spain include: *a series of riots in Belfast in 1932 and 1935. The 1932 riots, labeled the \\"Outdoor Relief Riots\\" were seen by many working class Protestants as a reason to turn to the politics of Socialism. William Tumilson, a working class Protestant, volunteered to join the IRA in the Short Strand district and subsequently became involved in the politics of Republican Congress following the riots. *Harry Midgley, leader of the Northern Ireland Labour Party, supported the Spanish Republic, but this alienated most of his Catholic supporters. *sections of the Catholic Church's support of General√≠simo Francisco Franco also turned many to support the legitimate government. *media reporting of the bombing of Guernica in April 1937 and a perceived bias in pro-Francoist media reporting in the Irish and British media. Along with radio reports given by Frank Ryan on \\"Radio Madrid\\". *it was easier to form a \\"common front\\" against fascism abroad rather than against imperialism and unionism at homeThis was the view expressed by Jack MacGougan then secretary of the NI. Socialist Party (NISP). *events organized across Ireland, including the Ulster Hall in Belfast, in which Basque representatives encouraged participation *a continuation of the struggle that the Irish had been engaged in; Tumlinson was to write home shortly before his death on 14 March 1937: > \\"Still determined to stay here until fascism is completely crushed. > Impossible to do other than continue on with the slogan of Cathal Brugha: > \\"No Surrender\\" Legacy The heavy toll paid by the Republican side in terms of manpower and eventual defeat lead to the imprisonment of those who did not escape from Spain following the victory of the Francoists. While many Socialist and Republicans were able to escape on time, they returned to an Ireland which had undergone significant change in terms of restrictions placed on those sympathetic to the aims of the IRA. Commemorations of the part Irish Republicans and Socialists played in the conflict are still held and a plaque honoring IRA volunteers from the Short Strand in Belfast is the site of annual ceremonies.

It is built from the Arabic words Abd, al- and Rahman. The name means \\"servant of the most gracious\\", ar-Rahman being one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names. The letter A of the al- is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by u. Because the letter R is a sun letter, the letter l of the al- is assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written in Arabic with letters corresponding to Abd al-Rahman, the usual pronunciation corresponds to Abd ar-Rahman. Alternative transliterations include ‚ÄòAbd ar-Rahman, Abdulrahman, Abdur Rehman, Abdul Rehman, Abidur Rahman, and others, all subject to variant spacing and hyphenation.

The concept involves temporarily swapping one family member between two families. The docu-soap premiered on 14 July 2003. The show runs every Thursday at 9:15 p.m. as part of the evening lineup of commercial broadcast channel RTL II. It is produced by Constantin Entertainment GmbH. Reruns are shown on weekday mornings.  Content  Each episode of the Docu-soap shows two women‚Äîas well as, alternatively, one or two (homosexual) men‚Äîwho swap households and live with another family for 10 days. The 90-minute program depicts how the participants struggle with, among other things, homesickness, a longing for their families and problems adapting to the environment. In order to increase the tension and potential for conflict, the producers of the show often tend to choose women who come from different backgrounds and have strongly contrasting ways of life such as, for example, rural and suburban families or pious and atheist families. This program is similar to other Wife Swap programs, when, for ten days, wives exchange homes and families. They are allowed to advise each other through a video and information cards. They meet blindfolded, half-way en route to their new homes. They are allowed to greet each other, then are later asked for their impression of the meeting. On the tenth and last day of the swap the wives prepare for their trip home, and say goodbye to their substitute families. At the half-way point en route to their apartments, the women or men meet each other again. They might give each other advice on what they can change or talk about problems encountered, etc. Sometimes the discussions end in insults or even in violence. Finally their arrival at their own home and how their families receive them are shown. On 18 May 2006 the hundredth episode was shown with a big anniversary special. It was shown whether the lives of the families who have taken part in Frauentausch have changed or whether there are new friendships between some families. Prisma Film produces with Tausche Familie a similarly successful format for Austrian television.

Born November 20, 1882 in Warsaw to a gentry family. In 1910 he graduated from the faculty of philosophy of the Jagiellonian University of Krak√≥w. He continued his studies at the Academy of Forestry in Dresden, where he received his diploma in 1911. In 1913 he returned to Warsaw and became a member of the committee of the SDKPiL party. Evacuated from Warsaw in 1915, he moved to Moscow, where in 1917 he also became an active member of the Bolshevik Party. He was one of the directors of the Polish-language Trybuna newspaper published in revolutionary Moscow and a notable promoter of the communist movement among the Polish expatriates in Russia. A representative of the SDKPiL at the Brest peace talks, after the end of World War I in Russia he started to organize the Red Regiment of Revolutionary Warsaw, a military unit of the Red Army composed primarily of Poles. With time the regiment grew to become the core of the Western Rifle Division, later renamed to the Soviet 52nd Rifle Division, of which Bobi≈Ñski was a commissar. During the Soviet offensive on Warsaw during the Polish- Soviet War, Bobi≈Ñski became the secretary of propaganda in a shadow government formed by the Communist Party of Poland (the Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee). However, the Soviet defeat in the battle of Warsaw brought his career to an end. He continued his career as a Russian communist politician and at various times he was a delegate to the Comintern and Communist Party General Committee. In 1929 he was demoted of most his party posts and became a head of a technical museum in Moscow. He was arrested in the evening of June 15, 1937 by NKVD during the[Great Purge] and was sentenced to death by Kolegium Wojskowe Sadu Najwyzszego CCCP, (based on the decree CKW CCCP from 1.12.1934).

Most commonly found in the temporal lobe, DNTs have been classified as benign tumours. These are glioneuronal tumours comprising both glial and neuron cells and often have ties to focal cortical dysplasia. Varying subclasses of DNTs have been presently identified, with dispute existing in the field on how to properly group these classes. The identification of possible genetic markers to these tumours is currently underway. With DNTs often causing epileptic seizures, surgical removal is a common treatment, providing high rates of success.  Signs and symptoms  Seizures and epilepsy are the strongest ties to dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours. The most common symptom of DNTs are complex partial seizures. Simple DNTs more frequently manifest generalized seizures. In children, DNTs are considered to be the second leading cause of epilepsy. A headache is another common symptom. Other neurological impairments besides seizures are not common.  Pathogenesis  Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours are largely glioneuronal tumours, meaning they are composed of both glial cells and neurons. Three subunits of DNTs have been commonly identified: * Simple: Specific glioneuronal elements are the sole components of simple DNTs. * Complex: Glial nodules and/or type 3b focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), in addition to the glioneuronal elements are present in complex DNTs. Both the nodules and FCD can be present within the same tumour, though only 47% of complex DNTs are linked to FCD. * Nonspecific: Nonspecific DNTs are lacking the glioneuronal elements common to DNTs but will show glial nodules and/or type 3b FCD. Eighty-five percent of nonspecific case of DNTs show this FCD. There currently exists some debate over where to make the proper division for the subunits of DNTs. A fourth subunit is sometimes noted as a mixed subunit. This mixed subunit expresses the glial nodules and components of ganglioglioma. Other findings suggest that DNTs require a reclassification to associate them with oligodendrogliomas, tumours that arise from solely glial cells. These reports suggest that the neurons found within DNTs are much rarer than previously reported. For the neurons that are seen in the tumours, it is suggested that they had been trapped within the tumor upon formation, and are not a part of the tumour itself.  Diagnosis  Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour, MRI FLAIR. A dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour is commonly diagnosed in patients who are experiencing seizures with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalogram (EEG). A DNT is most commonly diagnosed in children who are experiencing seizures, and when given medication do not respond to them. When an MRI is taken there are lesions located in the temporal parietal region of the brain. Typical DNTs can be detected in an EEG scan when there are rapid repetitive spikes against a contrasted background. EEG are predominantly localized with DNT location in the brain, however there are nonspecific cases in which the location of the tumour is abnormal and not localized. = Classification = Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours are classified as a benign tumour, Grade I of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of brain tumours. This classification by WHO only covers the simple and complex subunits. Groups lacking glioneuronal elements were not considered to have fallen in the same group and have thusly not yet been classified. = Complications in diagnosis = Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours are often described as a low grade tumour because about 1.2% people under the age of twenty are affected and about 0.2% over the age of twenty are affected by this tumour. Since its prevalence is small among the population, it often goes misdiagnosed or even at times goes undiagnosed.  Treatment  The most common course of treatment of DNT is surgery. About 70-90% of surgery are successful in removing the tumour. Since the tumour is most often benign, and does not impose immediate threat, aggressive treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation are not needed, and therefore patients especially children and young adults do not have to go through the side effects of these treatments. In order for the seizures to completely be stopped the tumour needs to be completely removed. For the tumor to be completely removed doctors need to perform resections consisting an anterior temporal lobectomy or amygdalo-hippocampectomy. It has been found that if the tumour is removed by performing resections patients are then recognized as seizure free. On the other hand, if resections are not performed, and the tumour is not completely removed, then the patient is still at risk of experiencing the seizures. In a study done by Bilginer et al., 2009, looking at patients whose tumour was not completely removed, and saw that they were still experiencing seizures, concluding that the incomplete resection as a being a failure. This then causes the patient to undergo a second surgery and remove the tumour in which case causing a complete resection.  Outcomes  Recurrence of the tumour is highly unlikely if the patient undergoes a complete resection since the tumour is completely taken out. Most of the tumours observed in patients are benign tumours, and once taken out do not cause neurological deficits. However, there have been incidents where the tumour was malignant. There have been cases where the malignant tumour has made a reoccurrence, and this happens at the site of the residual tumour in which an incomplete resection has been done. In this case, a second operation has to be done in order to completely remove the malignant tumour. In a study done with Daumas Duport and Varlet, 2003, they have found that there has been one case so far that the tumour has come back, however, in that particular case the patient underwent an incomplete resection, which led them to perform a second surgery in order to remove it completely. This evidence shows that surgery and complete resections are one of the better approaches in treating dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours. Furthermore, a longer period of epilepsy, and patients older in age are less likely to have a full recovery and remain seizure free. This is the case because their body is not able to recover as quickly, as it would for a child who has had one seizure before. Therefore, it is crucial to diagnose and perform the surgery early in order to make a full recovery.  Epidemiology  Children are much more prone to exhibit these dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours than adults. The mean age of onset of seizures for children with DNTs is 8.1 years old. Few other neurological deficits are associated with DNTs, so that earlier detection of the tumour before seizure symptoms are rare. DNTs are found in the temporal lobe in 84% of reported cases. In children, DNTs account for 0.6% of diagnosed central nervous system tumours. It has been found that males have a slightly higher risk of having these tumours. Some familial accounts of DNTs have been documented, though the genetic ties have not yet been fully confirmed.  History  Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours were usually found during investigation of patients who underwent multiple seizures. The tumours were encountered when the patient required surgery to help with the epilepsy to help with the seizures. The term DNT was first introduced in 1988 by Daumas-Duport, terming it dysembryoplastic, suggesting a dysembryoplastic origin in early onset seizures, and neuroepithelial to allow the wide range of possible varieties of tumours to be put into the category. In 2003 and 2007, DNT was made into further subsets of categories based upon the displayed elements within the tumour.

About 60% of the district's territory is covered by forests, mostly pine. Swamps occupy another 3.6%. History Sts. Peter and Paul Lutheran (Finnish) Church, Toksovo Originally, the area of the district was populated by Finnic peoples, and historically was changing hands between Sweden and Russia; in particular, at some point it belonged to the Novgorod Republic, and from the 15th century, it was annexed together with all Novgorod Lands by the Grand Duchy of Moscow; it belonged to the Vodskaya pyatina, one of the five pyatinas of Novgorod Lands. In 1617, according to the Treaty of Stolbovo, the west of the area was transferred to Sweden, and in 1721, according to the Treaty of Nystad, it was transferred back by Russia. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, it became a part of Saint Petersburgsky Uyezd, and in 1755, Shlisselburgsky Uyezd was established, and the current area of the district became split between the two uyezds. In 1914, the uyezd and the governorate were renamed Leningradsky. On February 14, 1923 Shlisselburgsky Uyezd was merged into Petrogradsky Uyezd. In January, 1924 the uyezd and the governorate were renamed Leningradsky. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Leninsky District, with the administrative center in the settlement of Vsevolozhskoye, was established. The governorates were also abolished, and the district was a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. It included parts of former Leningradsky Uyezd. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished as well, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On August 19, 1930 Leninsky District was abolished and merged into newly established Leningradsky Prigorodny District with the administrative center in the city of Leningrad. Another district established on August 1, 1927 was Pargolovsky District with the administrative center in the settlement of Pargolovo III. It was a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast and included parts of former Leningradsky Uyezd. On August 19, 1930 Pargolovsky District was abolished and split between Kuyvozovsky District and newly established Leningradsky Prigorodny District. On August 19, 1936 Leningradsky Prigorodny District was abolished and split between the town of Leningrad and Krasnoselsky, Slutsky, Mginsky, Vsevolozhsky and Pargolovsky Districts. Krasnoselsky, Slutsky, Vsevolozhsky, and Pargolovsky Districts were established on that day to accommodate the areas previously belonging to Leningradsky Prigorodny District. On August 19, 1936 Vsevolozhsky District, with the administrative center in the suburban settlement of Vsevolozhskoye, was established on the areas which previously belonged to Leningradsky Prigorodny District. It also included urban-type settlements of Imeni Morozova and Dubrovka. On November 27, 1938 a number of suburban settlements, including Vsevolozhskoye, were merged into the urban-type settlement of Vsevolozhsky, which became the center of the district. During World War II, the district was not occupied, and played an important role in the Siege of Leningrad: The goods were transported to Leningrad across the ice on the Lake Ladoga, to Kokkorevo, and then to Leningrad across the district (the Road of Life). On December 8, 1955 some areas in the south of the district were transferred to the city of Leningrad. On February 1, 1963 the urban-type settlement of Vsevolozhsky was renamed Vsevolozhsk and granted the status of town of oblast significance. In 2010, the administrative division of Leningrad Oblast was harmonized with the municipal division, and Vsevolozhsk was made the town of district significance. On 29 June 2018, the former village of Kudrovo was granted a town status. Another district established on August 19, 1936 was Pargolovsky District with the administrative center in the settlement of Pargolovo. It included areas which previously belonged to Leningradsky Prigorodny District and Toksovsky District. On November 9, 1938 Pargolovo became an urban-type settlement. During World War II, in Pargolovsky District battles between Soviet and Finnish armies took place.

Chadbourne, was a 400 lawyer firm, which operated from 12 offices, in ten countries. Chadbourne was probably best known for its global practice in project finance and energy, international insurance and reinsurance practice, multi-jurisdictional litigation in courts from Rhode Island to Russia, and corporate transactions. On February 21, 2017, Norton Rose Fulbright and Chadbourne & Parke agreed to merge into a combined firm known as Norton Rose Fulbright, with about 4,000 lawyers and annual revenue around $2 billion. Overview In addition to its United States work, the firm has established substantial practices in Western, Central and Eastern Europe, Turkey, the Middle East and Latin America. In 2014, the firm moved to its home at 1301 Avenue of the Americas. Prior to 2014, the firm had been located at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, where it occupied eight floors. The firm moved to Rockefeller Plaza from its original Wall Street home in 1973 in order to become more accessible to its national and international clients. An even earlier ‚Äúmove‚Äù occurred in 1935 when it formed one of the first branch offices of a New York law firm in Washington, DC. Beginning in 1990 in Moscow, Chadbourne established offices in England, Poland, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, receiving a significant boost in its Eastern Europe network from the dissolving firms Altheimer & Gray and Coudert Brothers. In March 2008, the firm acquired the Mexico City office of the New York firm Thacher Proffitt & Wood as well as an associated team of lawyers in New York focusing on Latin America-related arbitration and transactions. Its newest offices opened in S√£o Paulo, Brazil and Istanbul, Turkey respectively. The firm also has a small satellite office in China. Chadbourne's clients included Thomas Edison, Winston Churchill, James Joyce and the Wright brothers. In 1924, Tom Chadbourne orchestrated the consolidation of New York City's subway system. The firm's success in two landmark cases before the United States Supreme Court in the 1980s created the legal framework for development of the cogeneration and independent power production industries. In its successful representation of French and U.S. clients in the DeLorean sports car fiasco in Northern Ireland, the disclosure of Cabinet minutes was compelled for the first time in British history. The first ever approval for entry of a foreign law firm in India was obtained for Chadbourne and Parke. Practices Main areas of practice include arbitration, antitrust, commercial and products liability litigation, corporate finance, employment law and ERISA, energy/renewable energy, insolvency/financial restructuring, insurance and reinsurance, intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, private funds, project finance, real estate, securities litigation and regulatory enforcement, special investigations and litigation, trusts and estates and government contract matters and US and international tax. In 2012, Chadbourne acted as counsel on the winning and runner-up deals of Power Finance and Risk Magazine's \\"Renewables Deal of the Year\\" Awards. Chadbourne's project finance practice is consistently ranked in the top tier by legal guides such as Chambers Global - The World‚Äôs Leading Lawyers for Business. The firm's primary projects focus is on energy, telecommunications and toll roads. The firm's insolvency and financial restructuring group had an impressive record of achieving successful outcomes for its clients in Chapter 11 cases and corporate restructurings both in the United States and abroad. Chadbourne played leading roles in mega-cases such as Tribune Company, ASARCO, Technical Olympic USA (TOUSA), VeraSun Energy, Lehman and AbitibiBowater. Chadbourne was among the premier international law firms serving the Latin America region. Demonstrating breadth and depth in corporate, project finance, insurance and disputes related matters in the region, the firm's multi-disciplinary and multi-jurisdictional Latin America practice was ranked across the board by legal guides Chambers Latin America - The World‚Äôs Leading Lawyers for Business and Legal 500 Latin America. The firm's European offices werepredominantly staffed by nationals of those countries who provide legal services and advice on local law and foreign direct investment. Chambers Europe - The World‚Äôs Leading Lawyers for Business (2012) ranked 15 attorneys from Chadbourne's Russian, Central Europe and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) offices as leaders in their field, including partners in the Moscow, Warsaw and Kyiv offices. In February 2008, Chadbourne formed a climate change practice, led by Gov. Pataki and Mr. John Cahill. The practice drew on the experience of Chadbourne's transactional, insurance, regulatory, energy, environmental, litigation and public policy attorneys, and includes expertise in market-based carbon cap and trade programs. This was closely followed by the launch, in April 2008, of a firm-wide \\"Green Initiative.\\" to implement more environmentally-sustainable practices in the firm's daily practices. This implemented sustainable work-place practices that enabled the firm to reduce its carbon footprint and make a significant positive impact on the environment. In April 2008, Chadbourne formed a nanotechnologies practice, drawing on the firm's existing practices in energy, insurance, private equity, intellectual property, litigation and products liability.

When first developed in the 18th century, it was a major technical achievement, as accurate knowledge of the time over a long sea voyage is necessary for navigation, lacking electronic or communications aids. The first true chronometer was the life work of one man, John Harrison, spanning 31 years of persistent experimentation and testing that revolutionized naval (and later aerial) navigation and enabling the Age of Discovery and Colonialism to accelerate. The term chronometer was coined from the Greek words œáœÅœåŒΩŒøœÇ (chronos) (meaning time) and meter (meaning measure) in 1714 by Jeremy Thacker, an early competitor for the prize set by the Longitude Act in the same year. It has recently become more commonly used to describe watches tested and certified to meet certain precision standards. Timepieces made in Switzerland may display the word \\"chronometer\\" only if certified by the COSC (Official Swiss Chronometer Testing Institute).  History  The marine \\"Chronometer\\" of Jeremy Thacker used gimbals and a vacuum in a bell jar. To determine a position on the Earth's surface, it is necessary and sufficient to know the latitude, longitude, and altitude. Altitude considerations can naturally be ignored for vessels operating at sea level. Until the mid-1750s, accurate navigation at sea out of sight of land was an unsolved problem due to the difficulty in calculating longitude. Navigators could determine their latitude by measuring the sun's angle at noon (i.e., when it reached its highest point in the sky, or culmination) or, in the Northern Hemisphere, to measure the angle of Polaris (the North Star) from the horizon (usually during twilight). To find their longitude, however, they needed a time standard that would work aboard a ship. Observation of regular celestial motions, such as Galileo's method based on observing Jupiter's natural satellites, was usually not possible at sea due to the ship's motion. The lunar distances method, initially proposed by Johannes Werner in 1514, was developed in parallel with the marine chronometer. The Dutch scientist Gemma Frisius was the first to propose the use of a chronometer to determine longitude in 1530 The purpose of a chronometer is to measure accurately the time of a known fixed location, for example Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This is particularly important for navigation. Knowing GMT at local noon allows a navigator to use the time difference between the ship's position and the Greenwich Meridian to determine the ship's longitude. As the Earth rotates at a regular rate, the time difference between the chronometer and the ship's local time can be used to calculate the longitude of the ship relative to the Greenwich Meridian (defined as 0¬∞) using spherical trigonometry. In modern practice, a nautical almanac and trigonometric sight-reduction tables permit navigators to measure the Sun, Moon, visible planets, or any of 57 selected stars for navigation at any time that the horizon is visible. The creation of a timepiece which would work reliably at sea was difficult. Until the 20th century, the best timekeepers were pendulum clocks, but both the rolling of a ship at sea and the up to 0.2% variations in the gravity of Earth made a simple gravity-based pendulum useless both in theory and in practice. = First examples = Henry Sully (1680-1729) presented a first marine chronometer in 1716 Christiaan Huygens, following his invention of the pendulum clock in 1656, made the first attempt at a marine chronometer in 1673 in France, under the sponsorship of Jean-Baptiste Colbert.The maze of ingenuity: ideas and idealism in the development of technology Arnold Pacey New p.133ff In 1675, Huygens, who was receiving a pension from Louis XIV, invented a chronometer that employed a balance wheel and a spiral spring for regulation, instead of a pendulum, opening the way to marine chronometers and modern pocket watches and wristwatches. He obtained a patent for his invention from Colbert, but his clock remained imprecise at sea. Huygens' attempt in 1675 to obtain an English patent from Charles II stimulated Robert Hooke, who claimed to have conceived of a spring-driven clock years earlier, to attempt to produce one and patent it. During 1675 Huygens and Hooke each delivered two such devices to Charles, but none worked well and neither Huygens nor Hooke received an English patent. It was during this work that Hooke formulated what is known as Hooke's Law. John Harrison's H1 marine chronometer of 1735 The first published use of the term was in 1684 in Arcanum Navarchicum, a theoretical work by Kiel professor Matthias Wasmuth. This was followed by a further theoretical description of a chronometer in works published by English scientist William Derham in 1713. Derham's principal work, Physico-theology, or a demonstration of the being and attributes of God from his works of creation, also proposed the use of vacuum sealing to ensure greater accuracy in the operation of clocks. Attempts to construct a working marine chronometer were begun by Jeremy Thacker in England in 1714, and by Henry Sully in France two years later. Sully published his work in 1726 with Une Horloge invent√©e et execut√©e par M. Sulli, but neither his nor Thacker's models were able to resist the rolling of the seas and keep precise time while in shipboard conditions.A Chronology of Clocks Drawings of Harrison's H4 chronometer of 1761, published in The principles of Mr Harrison's time-keeper, 1767.The principles of Mr Harrison's time-keeper In 1714, the British government offered a longitude prize for a method of determining longitude at sea, with the awards ranging from ¬£10,000 to ¬£20,000 (¬£2 million to ¬£4 million in terms) depending on accuracy. John Harrison, a Yorkshire carpenter, submitted a project in 1730, and in 1735 completed a clock based on a pair of counter-oscillating weighted beams connected by springs whose motion was not influenced by gravity or the motion of a ship. His first two sea timepieces H1 and H2 (completed in 1741) used this system, but he realised that they had a fundamental sensitivity to centrifugal force, which meant that they could never be accurate enough at sea. Construction of his third machine, designated H3, in 1759 included novel circular balances and the invention of the bi-metallic strip and caged roller bearings, inventions which are still widely used. However, H3's circular balances still proved too inaccurate and he eventually abandoned the large machines.A description concerning such mechanism as will afford a nice, or true, mensuration of time John Harrison, 1775, p.14 \\"..no ponderosity in a pendulum or a balance, can rightly or ever make up the want of velocity; and indeed velocity was very much wanting in my three large machines..\\" Ferdinand Berthoud's marine chronometer no.3, 1763 Harrison solved the precision problems with his much smaller H4 chronometer design in 1761. H4 looked much like a large five-inch (12 cm) diameter pocket watch. In 1761, Harrison submitted H4 for the ¬£20,000 longitude prize. His design used a fast-beating balance wheel controlled by a temperature-compensated spiral spring. These features remained in use until stable electronic oscillators allowed very accurate portable timepieces to be made at affordable cost. In 1767, the Board of Longitude published a description of his work in The Principles of Mr. Harrison's time-keeper. A French expedition under Charles-Fran√ßois-C√©sar Le Tellier de Montmirail performed the first measurement of longitude using marine chronometers aboard Aurore in 1767. = Modern development = Pierre Le Roy marine chronometer, 1766, photographed at the Mus√©e des Arts et M√©tiers in Paris In France, 1748, Pierre Le Roy invented the detent escapement characteristic of modern chronometers.Britten's Watch & Clock Makers' Handbook Dictionary & Guide Fifteenth Edition p.122 In 1766, Pierre Le Roy created a revolutionary chronometer that incorporated a detent escapement, the temperature-compensated balance and the isochronous balance spring: Harrison showed the possibility of having a reliable chronometer at sea, but these developments by Le Roy are considered by Rupert Gould to be the foundation of the modern chronometer. The innovations of Le Roy made the chronometer a much more accurate piece than had been anticipated. Harrison's Chronometer H5 of 1772, now on display at the Science Museum, London Ferdinand Berthoud in France, as well as Thomas Mudge in Britain also successfully produced marine timekeepers. Although none were simple, they proved that Harrison's design was not the only answer to the problem. The greatest strides toward practicality came at the hands of Thomas Earnshaw and John Arnold, who in 1780 developed and patented simplified, detached, \\"spring detent\\" escapements, Pierre Le Roy had developed the detached spring detent escapement around 1748, but abandoned the concept. moved the temperature compensation to the balance, and improved the design and manufacturing of balance springs. This combination of innovations served as the basis of marine chronometers until the electronic era. Ferdinand Berthoud chronometer no. 24 (1782), on display at the Mus√©e des Arts et M√©tiers, Paris The new technology was initially so expensive that not all ships carried chronometers, as illustrated by the fateful last journey of the East Indiaman Arniston, shipwrecked with the loss of 372 lives. However, by 1825, the Royal Navy had begun routinely supplying its vessels with chronometers. It was common for ships at the time to observe a time ball, such as the one at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, to check their chronometers before departing on a long voyage. Every day, ships would anchor briefly in the River Thames at Greenwich, waiting for the ball at the observatory to drop at precisely 1pm. This practice was in small part responsible for the subsequent adoption of Greenwich Mean Time as an international standard. (Time balls became redundant around 1920 with the introduction of radio time signals, which have themselves largely been superseded by GPS time.) In addition to setting their time before departing on a voyage, ship chronometers were also routinely checked for accuracy while at sea by carrying out lunar or solar observations. In typical use, the chronometer would be mounted in a sheltered location below decks to avoid damage and exposure to the elements. Mariners would use the chronometer to set a so-called hack watch, which would be carried on deck to make the astronomical observations. Though much less accurate (and expensive) than the chronometer, the hack watch would be satisfactory for a short period of time after setting it (i.e., long enough to make the observations). Although industrial production methods began revolutionizing watchmaking in the middle of the 19th century, chronometer manufacture remained craft-based much longer. Around the turn of the 20th century, Swiss makers such as Ulysse Nardin made great strides toward incorporating modern production methods and using fully interchangeable parts, but it was only with the onset of World War II that the Hamilton Watch Company in the United States perfected the process of mass production, which enabled it to produce thousands of its Hamilton Model 21 and Model 22 chronometers of World War Two for the United States Navy & Army and other Allied navies. Despite Hamilton's success, chronometers made in the old way never disappeared from the marketplace during the era of mechanical timekeepers. Thomas Mercer Chronometers still makes chronometers to the present day. Without their accuracy and the accuracy of the feats of navigation that marine chronometers enabled, it is arguable that the ascendancy of the Royal Navy, and by extension that of the British Empire, might not have occurred so overwhelmingly; the formation of the empire by wars and conquests of colonies abroad took place in a period in which British vessels had reliable navigation due to the chronometer, while their Portuguese, Dutch, and French opponents did not.Alfred T. Mahan, The Influence of Sea Power on History: For example: the French were well established in India and other places before Britain, but were defeated by naval forces in the Seven Years' War. The most complete international collection of marine chronometers, including Harrison's H1 to H4, is at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in London, UK.  Characteristics  German). Note fusee to transform varying spring tension to a constant force The crucial problem was to find a resonator that remained unaffected by the changing conditions met by a ship at sea. The balance wheel, harnessed to a spring, solved most of the problems associated with the ship's motion. Unfortunately, the elasticity of most balance spring materials changes relative to temperature. To compensate for ever-changing spring strength, the majority of chronometer balances used bi-metallic strips to move small weights toward and away from the centre of oscillation, thus altering the period of the balance to match the changing force of the spring. The balance spring problem was solved with a nickel-steel alloy named Elinvar for its invariable elasticity at normal temperatures. The inventor was Charles √âdouard Guillaume, who won the 1920 Nobel Prize for physics in recognition for his metallurgical work. The escapement serves two purposes. First, it allows the train to advance fractionally and record the balance's oscillations. At the same time, it supplies minute amounts of energy to counter tiny losses from friction, thus maintaining the momentum of the oscillating balance. The escapement is the part that ticks. Since the natural resonance of an oscillating balance serves as the heart of a chronometer, chronometer escapements are designed to interfere with the balance as little as possible. There are many constant-force and detached escapement designs, but the most common are the spring detent and pivoted detent. In both of these, a small detent locks the escape wheel and allows the balance to swing completely free of interference except for a brief moment at the centre of oscillation, when it is least susceptible to outside influences. At the centre of oscillation, a roller on the balance staff momentarily displaces the detent, allowing one tooth of the escape wheel to pass. The escape wheel tooth then imparts its energy on a second roller on the balance staff. Since the escape wheel turns in only one direction, the balance receives impulse in only one direction. On the return oscillation, a passing spring on the tip of the detent allows the unlocking roller on the staff to move by without displacing the detent. The weakest link of any mechanical timekeeper is the escapement's lubrication. When the oil thickens through age or temperature or dissipates through humidity or evaporation, the rate will change, sometimes dramatically as the balance motion decreases through higher friction in the escapement. A detent escapement has a strong advantage over other escapements as it needs no lubrication. An impulse from the escape wheel to the impulse roller is nearly dead-beat, meaning little sliding action needing lubrication. Chronometer escape wheels and passing springs are typically gold due to the metal's lower slide friction over brass and steel. Chronometers often included other innovations to increase their efficiency and precision. Hard stones such as ruby and sapphire were often used as jewel bearings to decrease friction and wear of the pivots and escapement. Diamond was often used as the cap stone for the lower balance staff pivot to prevent wear from years of the heavy balance turning on the small pivot end. Until the end of mechanical chronometer production in the third quarter of the 20th century, makers continued to experiment with things like ball bearings and chrome-plated pivots. Marine chronometers always contain a maintaining power which keeps the chronometer going while it is being wound, and a power reserve to indicate how long the chronometer will continue to run without being wound. Marine chronometers are the most accurate portable mechanical clocks ever made, achieving a precision of around a 0.1 second per day or less than one minute per year. This is accurate enough to locate a ship's position within 1‚Äì2 miles (2‚Äì3 km) after a month's sea voyage. Chronometer rating In strictly horological terms, \\"rating\\" a chronometer means that prior to the instrument entering service, the average rate of gaining or losing per day is observed and recorded on a rating certificate which accompanies the instrument. This daily rate is used in the field to correct the time indicated by the instrument to get an accurate time reading. Even the best-made chronometer with the finest temperature compensation etc. exhibits two types of error, (1) random and (2) consistent. The quality of design and manufacture of the instrument keeps the random errors small. In principle, the consistent errors should be amenable to elimination by adjustment, but in practice it is not possible to make the adjustment so precisely that this error is completely eliminated, so the technique of rating is used. The rate will also change while the instrument is in service due to e.g. thickening of the oil, so on long expeditions the instrument's rate would be periodically checked against accurate time determined by astronomical observations. Today Omega 4.19 MHz Ships Marine Chronometer, French Navy issued Ships and boats commonly use electronic aids to navigation, mostly the Global Navigation Satellite Systems. However celestial navigation, which requires the use of a precise chronometer, is still a requirement for certain international mariner certifications such as Officer in Charge of Navigational Watch, and Master and Chief Mate deck officers, and supplements offshore yachtmasters on long-distance private cruising yachts.Yachting Chronometer and Sextant, Accessed 25 May 2013, publisher=Nautische Instrumente Modern marine chronometers can be based on quartz clocks that are corrected periodically by GPS signals or radio time signals (see radio clock). These quartz chronometers are not always the most accurate quartz clocks when no signal is received, and their signals can be lost or blocked.

They are commonly found around urchin barrens, as the sea urchin is a favorite food. They also eat clams, snails, abalone, sea cucumbers and other sea stars. In Monterey Bay, California, they will feed on dead or dying squid. Although the sunflower sea star can greatly extend its mouth, for larger prey, the stomach can extend outside the mouth to digest prey, such as gastropods like abalone.Sea stars and relatives, Edmonds Discovery Programs, City of Edmonds, Washington. Easily stressed by predators such as large fish and other sea stars, they can shed arms to escape, which will grow back within a few weeks. They are preyed upon by the king crab. =Reproduction= Sunflower sea stars can reproduce sexually through broadcast spawning. They also have separate sexes. Sunflower sea stars breed from May through June. In preparing to spawn, they arch up using a dozen or so arms to hoist their fleshy central mass free of the seafloor and release gametes into the water for external fertilization. The microscopic sea star larvae float and feed near the surface for two to ten weeks. After the planktonic larval period, the larvae settle to the bottom and transform into juveniles.

When the dam was constructed, little effort was made to cut the trees that would soon be underwater. It was believed that the trees would soon die and decompose once submerged. While this was true for many of the trees, there are still many living Cypress trees in the middle of the lake, there are still many dead trees that have not fallen down, and many large areas, particularly on the northern half of the lake above the Highway 280 bridge, that have stumps below the water line. The stumps, popular with some fishermen, can be risky to recreational boaters. The lake borders five counties in Southwest Georgia: Crisp, Dooly, Lee, Sumter and Worth.

The software is written using Open CASCADE in C++ for the engine (geometry, topology, viewers, data management, ...), Java for the GUI and data are stored in extensible mark-up language XML. GeoModeller has started to revolutionise the working practices, data standards and products of a geological survey as a whole. The software takes into account all structural geology data such as dip, dip directions, strike, hingelines and axialtrace to build the geometry of geological units.  A brief outline of the methodology  GeoModeller utilizes a Digital Terrain Model, surface geological linework, cross-sections, geophysical interpretation and drillhole borehole data to enable the geologist to construct cross sections, or 3D models. 3D Geostatistical interpolation (co-kriging) using all the data (location of interface, dip, direction, ...) produces a 3D implicit function representing a solid model. The model build may take in account if necessary a network of geologic faults. The model could be represented by triangulated objects each corresponding to one of the geological units present. Geologists can draw the model in their sections to obtain a fence diagram. The geologist can use their knowledge to add information in the 3D space until he obtain a 'right' model.  Inversion of the 3D model  In geological and mining or oil exploration applications, seismic profiles as well as gravity and magnetic data are often available. Interpreted seismic cross-sections directly provide data that can be processed directly as geometric constraints for 3D modelling. On the other hand, gravity and magnetic data provide indirect constraints. Presently, a 3D geological model is considered as the initial state of a constrained inverse modelling of this data. That inversion is based on an iterative method, which is applied to a discrete version of the domain under study. This inversion formulation allows separate inversion of either gravity or magnetic data or simultaneous inversion of both datasets and tensor components of gravity and magnetic field . The final result is a probabilistic 3D geological model.  References  * Lajaunie Ch., Courrioux G., Manuel L. (1997).

In Switzerland, only timepieces certified by the Contr√¥le Officiel Suisse des Chronom√®tres (COSC) may use the word chronometer on them. Outside Switzerland, equivalent bodies, such as the Japan Chronometer Inspection Institute, have in the past certified timepieces to the same internationally recognised standards, although use of the term has not always been strictly controlled. History The term chronometer was coined by Jeremy Thacker of Beverley, England in 1714, referring to his invention of a clock ensconced in a vacuum chamber. The term chronometer is also used to describe a marine chronometer used for celestial navigation and determination of longitude. The marine chronometer was invented by John Harrison in 1730. This was the first of a series of chronometers that enabled accurate marine navigation. From then on, an accurate chronometer was essential to open-ocean marine or air navigation out of sight of land. Early in the Twentieth Century the advent of radiotelegraphy time signals supplemented the onboard marine chronometer for marine and air navigation, and various radio navigation systems were invented, developed, and implemented during and following the Second World War (e.g., Gee, Sonne (a.k.a. Consol), LORAN(-A and -C), Decca Navigator System and Omega Navigation System) that significantly reduced the need for positioning using the onboard marine chronometer. These culminated in the development and implementation of global satellite navigation systems (GSN-GPS) in the last half of the 20th century. The marine chronometer is no longer used as the primary means for navigation at sea, although it is still required as a backup, since radio systems and their associated electronics can fail for a variety of reasons. Once mechanical timepiece movements developed sufficient precision to allow for accurate marine navigation, there eventually developed what became known as \\"chronometer competitions\\" at astronomical observatories located in Europe. The Neuch√¢tel Observatory, Geneva Observatory, Besancon Observatory, and Kew Observatory are prominent examples of observatories that certified the accuracy of mechanical timepieces. The observatory testing regime typically lasted for 30 to 50 days and contained accuracy standards that were far more stringent and difficult than modern standards such as those set by COSC. When a movement passed the observatory, it became certified as an observatory chronometer and received a Bulletin de Marche from the Observatory, stipulating the performance of the movement. Because only very few movements were ever given the attention and manufacturing level necessary to pass the Observatory standards, there are very few observatory chronometers in existence. Most observatory chronometers had movements so specialized to accuracy that they could never withstand being used as wristwatches in normal usage. They were useful only for accuracy competitions, and so never were sold to the public for usage. However, in 1966 and 1967, Girard Perregaux manufactured approximately 670 wristwatches with the Calibre 32A movement, which became Observatory Chronometers certified by the Neuchatel Observatory, while in 1968, 1969 and 1970 Seiko had 226 wristwatches with its 4520 and 4580 Calibres certified. These observatory chronometers were then sold to the public for normal usage as wristwatches, and some examples may still be found today. The observatory competitions ended with the advent of the quartz watch movement, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which generally has superior accuracy at far lesser costs. In 2009, the Watch Museum of Le Locle renewed the tradition and launched a new chronometry contest based on ISO 3159 certification. In 2017 the Observatory Chronometer Database (OCD) Observatory Chronometer Database (OCD) went online, which contains all mechanical timepieces (\\"chronometres-mecaniques\\") certified as observatory chronometers by the observatory in Neuchatel from 1945 to 1967, due to a successful participation in the competition which resulted in the issuance of a Bulletin de Marche. All database entries are submissions to the wristwatch category (\\"chronometres-bracelet\\") at the observatory competition. The term chronometer is often wrongly applied to timekeeping instruments fitted with an additional mechanism that may be set in motion by pushbuttons to enable measurement of the duration of an event. Such an instrument is in fact a chronograph or chronoscope. It may of course be chronometer-certified, provided it meets the criteria set for the standard. Mechanical chronometers A mechanical chronometer is a spring-driven escapement timekeeper, like a watch, but its parts are more massively built. Changes in the elasticity of the balance spring caused by variations in temperature are compensated for by devices built into it.The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2008, Columbia University Press Chronometers often included other innovations to increase their efficiency and precision. Hard stones such as diamond, ruby, and sapphire were often used as jewel bearings to decrease friction and wear of the pivots and escapement. Chronometer makers also took advantage of the physical properties of rare metals such as gold, platinum, and palladium. =Complications= In horological terms, a complication in a mechanical watch is a special feature that causes the design of the watch movement to become more complicated. Examples of complications include: * Tourbillon * Perpetual calendar * Minute repeater * Equation of time * Power reserve * Moon phases * Chronograph * Rattrapante * Grande sonnerie More recent times Quartz and atomic timepieces have made mechanical chronometers obsolete for time standards used scientifically and/or industrially. Most watchmakers do still produce them. However, they are mostly considered status symbols promoted by luxury watchmakers as a symbol of fine craftmanship and aesthetics. Certified chronometers More than 1.8 million officially certified chronometer certificates, mostly for mechanical wrist-chronometers (wristwatches) with sprung balance oscillators, are being delivered each year, after passing the COSC's most extreme tests and being singly identified by an officially recorded individual serial number. According to COSC, a chronometer is a high precision watch capable of displaying the seconds and housing a movement that has been tested over several days, in different positions, and at different temperatures, by an official, neutral body (COSC). Each movement is individually tested for several consecutive days, in five positions and at three temperatures. Each movement is individually measured. Any watch with the denomination \\"chronometer\\" contains a certified movement and matches the criteria in ISO 3159.

A port has been made for PlayStation Portable. An expansion for the Windows version of the game, entitled Silverfall: Earth Awakening, was released in 2008. Silverfall: Gold Edition was also released in 2008, containing the main game as well as the expansion. Silverfall shares many similarities with popular games, Diablo and Diablo 2. It also has strong influences from Sacred. Players choose a character from one of four races (Human, Elf, Troll, Goblin) and develop their \\"class\\" (fighter, archer, mage, etc.) by assigning various skills as they level up. Characters can be either male or female, and gameplay will differ slightly based on the selection. Silverfall is a quest-based game which centers around a conflict between nature and technology, allowing players to develop an allegiance to one of these areas, which allows development of additional skills and the ability to use certain alignment-based items. However, there is no 'good' or 'evil' side to aligning with either technology or nature, as both will have quests that require the player to perform dubious and altruistic acts. A 'nature' player may be asked to kill the overseer of a group of workers who no longer want to pollute the world with their factory, and a 'technology' player may be asked to exploit natural resources that will result in a loss of the livelihood of a nearby people. At the same time, either player may be asked to promise a union leader a bribe in order to break up a strike, to the detriment of his fellow workers. Gameplay Players have the ability to take on companions and summon various creatures (such as zombies, lost souls, robots and elementals) to assist them in their quests. Known companions include: * Morka (Female Troll - ice magic/healer); aka \\"Morka the Good\\" - found in Refugee Camp * Gort (Male Troll - \\"tank\\" fighter); aka \\"Lord Gort\\" - found in Graybay * Danselame (Male Elf - fighter/berserker) - found in swamp, near elf village * Alina (Female Elf - fire magic) - found on road in wilderness * Portix (Male Goblin - archer) - found in Druid village * Dril (Female Goblin - shadow magic/healer); aka \\"Dril the Mechalchemist\\" - found in Cloudworks * Tanya (Female Human - guns) - found in Cloudworks Desert * Hulart (Male Human - air magic) - found in Gaian wilderness All companions require that some quest be performed before they will join the player's party, and depending on the player's attitude towards them throughout the game they may offer more quests. They will also initiate dialogues at various moments throughout the adventure, volunteering information on the area and/or their backstory. Skills are broken up in to 3 main categories: * melee and ranged combat (further divided into melee, ranged, technique) * use of magic (further divided into elemental, light, shadow) * racial and alignment (further divided into nature, technology, race) Each of these 9 sub-categories comes with its own \\"skill tree\\" for the player to choose from. Players receive 4 skill points each time they gain a level, and can add them to the skills of their choice. Each individual skill can have a maximum of 10 points. Players receive 4 attribute points each time they gain a level, and can add them to the attributes of their choice. the four attributes are strength, constitution, agility and intelligence. Items can also be used to modify attributes. As with most role-playing games, these four attributes have a direct impact on the way the player's character evolves. Spending points in agility will increase their effectiveness with a bow, spending points in strength will increase their damage with melee weapons. Intelligence directly affect the amount of 'Power' the character has to spend on magic and special attacks and Constitution directly affects the amount of health the character has. Items can be found as loot from killing monsters, bought from merchants or won as quest rewards. All items range in quality from ordinary to unique, as well as ranging in level (i.e. an item may be short sword level 38 ultimate). A particular item's level and quality is highly dependent on the area obtained and the character's level, rarely ranging far from the characters level at the time they obtain the item. In the players inventory, and the inventories of their companions, there are slots for body armour, gloves, boots, a backpack, an earring, a necklace, a ring, a helmet, ranged weapons and two hand weapon slots, the off- hand slot of which can be used for either a secondary weapon or a shield. The player has the ability to decide what is in these slots not only on their own character, but on both of their companions, though all items not in use are kept in a 'communal' inventory, rather than three individual inventories. The equipment a character can equip is dependent not only on their strength, but also on their allegiance, i.e. A nature player cannot equip technological implants. Silverfall, like most other RPGs, has both campaign quests essential to the storyline and optional, secondary quests. NPC's offering quests will show up on the mini-map as green dots, and a green arrow on the mini-map will show the direction the player needs to go in to complete the selected secondary quest. Secondary quests are beneficial for the experience the character receives for completing them, the rewards offered, the loyalty shifts between nature and technology and the possibility of companions joining. Campaign quests are given to the character by plot central NPCs, such as the child of the Archmage of Silverfall whom the PC meets at the beginning of the game. The arrows for these quests show up as yellow on the mini-map and generally have smaller rewards than those offered by secondary quests. Plot The plot of Silverfall begins with the city of Silverfall being destroyed by an unnamed evil force, later identified as the Shadow Mage. This section of the game is considered the tutorial, as the Player assumes the identity of the Archmage of Silverfall in defense of the city, rather than their own character, and pop-ups explain the basic workings of the game. At the end of the tutorial, the Archmage can either kill the as-yet-unnamed evil or be killed by him, which then possesses the Archmage's body. The Player then finds themselves in control of their own character in the middle of a camp of refugees from the fallen Silverfall. At the request of the Archmage's child (their sex depending on that of the player character, always the opposite thereof) the player must undertake basic quests in the surrounding swamp to protect the camp, find supplies, etc. The Archmage's child has known the player for years, and some sort of romantic involvement is hinted at in some of the dialogues. With the safety of the refugee camp established, the PC is asked to go to the city of Cloudworks, a technologically aligned city in the middle of a desert, in search of the Archmage. After settling the strike occurring, the player is granted access to Upper Cloudworks, where the king requests they investigate a noble who has been acting oddly. After storming her house, the player finds she was also corrupted by the Shadow Mage, and is sent to the robot factory to face-off the possessed Archmage of Silverfall. The killing blow is struck by the Archmage's son/daughter who managed to find their way through the robot factory before the player, but took no steps to confront the Shadow Mage until the player arrived (for the added drama, it would seem). The Shadow Mage then leaves the Archmage's body and possess the Archmage's child. The player character then returns to the ruined Silverfall to find the water supply has been contaminated by the living dead summoned by the Shadow Mage, and must be purified by Gaian druids who can be found to the North. Unfortunately, the druid have their own problems, with the holy water needed to purify Silverfall's supplies only available in a cave inhabited by beastmen. The player must fight their way through the cavern to the Chieftain of the Beastmen, who refuses to supply the needed water until the undead are cleaned out of their caves. After the player has completed this task, they must return to the Gaian druids for the water to be blessed. As the player arrives, the druid's village is being raided by elves corrupted by the influence of the Shadow Mage, and the player must kill the sorcerer in charge of the raid. After this victory, the druids agree to bless the water, but ask that the player character kill the Prince of the corrupt Elves to prevent further attacks. The player is then forced to fight their way into the heart of the Corrupt Elves' camp and slay the Prince, who with his dying breath explains the Shadow had promised him victory over the druids who had banished him so he would again have a land for his people. The Archmage's child then appears (now corrupted by the Shadow Mage) and ask the player to join them, but the player must refuse in light of the suffering of the people of Silverfall. Returning to the druids results in the player receiving the water to cleanse Silverfall's supplies. Unfortunately, the cleansing of the city's water supply isn't the last hurtle on the way to rebuilding Silverfall. Upon returning to the city, the player finds the king has been killed, the crown stolen, and the princess kidnapped. So the player's next action is to hunt down the attackers, apparently based in Greybay. The player can then choose one of two ways to reach Greybay: (1) to be transported directly to the Greybay docks, which results in a fierce battle, or (2) to walk, which takes much longer but avoids the heaviest fighting. Once in the Greybay docks, the player must fight their way through the ship belonging to the Princess' kidnappers and kill the captain. On his body, directions are found to the Necroraider graveyard where the Princess is being held. Once more, the player manages to fight their way through hordes of monsters to their goal: the crypt of the creator of the Necroraiders, Iznahel. Upon entering the crypt, the player is met by a ghost, revealed to be Iznahel, who taunts the player with words apparently from the Archmage of Silverfall's corrupted child. The spectre is met twice more before revealing the Princess has been turned into a ghoul, which the player must defeat, at which point Iznahel himself attacks. Upon his death (or 'dissipation' as he is already dead and attacks the player as a ghost), the player finds records regarding the Shadow Mage that has been plaguing Silverfall. These records reveal, amongst other things, that a way to destroy the Shadow was created, and is now kept in the nearby, snow-bound duchy of Steelight. The player must then fight their way through a snowy wilderness to find the small town of Steelight. However, once there, it is no simple matter getting a hold of the stone necessary to defeat the Shadow Mage. The current Duke of Steelight's health is rapidly ailing, and his mother fears for the continuity of their bloodline. She asks the player to find her son's illegitimate heir, whom she exiled several years before, in exchange for the stone to save the Archmage of Silverfall's child. With little choice but to accept, the player must find their way through an icy labyrinth inhabited by 'ice fairies', to find the child's mother. Once the child's mother is located, she tells the player that her son has been kidnapped by the frozen fey, and the player must then track him down. Returning to the labyrinth, the player slaughters scores of fiends, and tracks down the heir to Steelight's duchy, finding he was, in fact, being used by the king of the ice fairies as a vessel of some sort. Once the child is rescued, the player returns to Steelight and is granted access to the ancestral tomb of Steelight's ruling family. Which has, unfortunately, been taken over by the restless dead. The player then fights their way to the grave of the founder of Steelight, to find he has returned as a ghost, drawn back by the terrible happenings that began in Silverfall. The player receives the stone to cleanse the Archmage of Silverfall's child from the corruption of the shadow. Conveniently, the player doesn't have to track their childhood companion down, as they appear on the scene and beg the player not to 'kill' them with the stone. The player, however, ignores the shadow and proceeds to save their friend, who just has time to say a heartfelt thank you before the King of Darkness arrives and kills them. The player attacks in a rage, but the mastermind behind Silverfall's destruction and the many other schemes the player has tried to thwart manages to escape, talking about bring the God of Destruction into the world. With little left for the player to do but stop the impending destruction of the world, the player returns to Silverfall, and is told the only way to stop the summoning of the God of Destruction is to travel underneath the mountains and find the evil, subterranean dwarves in league with the King of Darkness and kill him before he can complete the ritual. The passage under the mountains, however, has been overrun by gigantic hostile insects, which the player must fight through to find the dwarven city. The dark king is creating a portal in the dwarven palace, and even though the player mortally wounds him, he manages to escape through it to Blaize, the capital city, where he plans to use the temple to summon the God of Destruction. The player follows him through, to find Silverfall and her allies have gathered and are about to launch a frontal assault, during which the player might just be able to fight their way to the temple to defeat the King once and for all. After cutting their way through wave upon wave of shadow knights and magma beasts, the player reaches the temple just as the Shadow King is nearing the end of the ritual, and witnesses the Avatar of the God of Destruction kill him, and turn on the player. The player defeats the avatar in an epic battle, and is declared the King or Queen of the land (because \\"who else would rule?\\"). The final movie shows all the major settlements happily recovered and the land prospering.

She has worked on the genetics of the immune system and cancer and has lobbied her country to invest in science. She is married to fellow scientist Jerry Adams, also a WEHI scientist, whom she met while studying for her PhD at the University of Cambridge, England.  Education and personal life  Suzanne Cory was raised in the Kew suburbs of Melbourne, Australia. She attended Canterbury Girls' Secondary College, followed by University High School, Melbourne. Her further education includes undergraduate studies at the University of Melbourne and earning a PhD from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in Cambridge, England. Cory attended the LMB at the same time as the Nobel Prize winners Francis Crick, known for his co-discovery of the structure of DNA, and Frederick Sanger, who revolutionised nucleic acid sequencing. While obtaining her PhD, Cory used Sanger's RNA sequencing techniques to identify the sequence of transfer RNA. Also, during her time at the LMB, Cory met her current husband, Jerry Adams, a scientist from the United States. The two scientists later married and had two daughters.  Research and accomplishments  Following her time at the LMB, Cory traveled to the University of Geneva for her post-doctoral studies. While in Geneva, she focused on sequencing the RNA of R17 bacteriophage for the purpose of using it as a model. In 1971, Cory and her husband began their research at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, located in Melbourne, Australia. The two scientists helped introduce new scientific technology and methods they had been exposed to in Geneva and Cambridge, which helped expand and better the molecular biology research in Australia. They initially chose to study the genetic component of immunity, discovering that antibody genes are a combination of pieces and can be arranged in a variety of ways. This discovery helped explain the diversity of the immune system and its ability to fight a large array of harmful cell invaders. After a decade of studying the immune system, Cory's lab switched their focus to cancer and the genetic components of various cancers. Her lab discovered the genetic mutations that lead to Burkitt's lymphoma and Follicular lymphoma. One of the main focuses of their cancer cell research is on cell proliferation and cell death. In particular, the oncoprotein Myc and the Bcl-2 protein family are of interest to her current research lab. Bcl-2 is an important family of intracellular proteins that helps regulate apoptosis, or cell suicide. Bcl-2, paired with other regulators, prevents caspases from being activated. The caspases, a type of protease, remain inactive until signaled through a cascade to degrade the proteins that make up a cell. Cory's lab has developed Bcl2-blocking agents called BH3 mimetics, which, when paired with low-dose chemotherapy, have had positive results treating specific types of aggressive lymphomas. Cory is the immediate past President of the Australian Academy of Science. She was the first-elected female President of the Academy and took office on 7 May 2010 for a four-year term, replacing the former president, Professor Kurt Lambeck. Since its formation in 1954, there has only been one other female president of the Australian Academy of Science, Professor Dorothy Hill, who filled in for Professor David Forbes Martyn after his death in 1970. Cory was the Director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI), from 1996 until 30 June 2009 and remains a faculty member, having rejoined the institute's Molecular Genetics of Cancer Division. Her current research focuses on genetic changes in blood cancers and the effects of chemotherapeutic drugs on the cancer cells. Cory's work has been published in research journals including Blood (journal), The EMBO Journal, Nature (journal), Cell Death & Differentiation, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. The Suzanne Cory High School opened in Cory's honour in 2011. The public high school caters to 800 students from grades 9-12. Qualified students gain entry to the school through a three-hour aptitude test, which is also used for placement into three other highly selective Australian high schools.

Transfiguration, 1555, Diocesan Museum, Cortona Cristofano or Cristoforo Gherardi, also known as il Doceno, (November 25, 1508 ‚Äì April 1556) was an Italian painter of the late-Renaissance or Mannerist period, active mainly in Florence and Tuscany. Biography He was born in Borgo San Sepolcro and also called il Doceno dal Borgo. He was the pupil of the painter Raffaellino del Colle, in whose shop he encountered Rosso Fiorentino and Giorgio Vasari. He painted under Vasari's direction, the one assistant of Vasari's whom Freedberg singles out. In 1536 Vasari invited him to Florence to assist in producing the decorations for the ceremonial entry of Charles V into Florence. The following year, in the reaction after Duke Alessandro's death, Gherardi was among those banished from Florence, so his work for Vasari was confined to projects outside Florence, until his banishment was lifted in 1554 and he was permitted to return. In the long interval he had painted the Visitation of Mary to Elizabeth for the church of San Domenico, Citt√† di Castello; church decorations in San Sepolcro; and works for the Vitelli,He painted at their Castello Bufalini in San Giustino in Umbria, along with Giovanni Battista Cungi; and at their palazzo in Citt√† di Castello (Freedberg 1993:454). who were long-term patrons.

Personal life Phillips graduated from Independence High School in Charlotte in 1987 before working for his father's truck equipment company. After competing in short tracks across the Carolinas, he moved to NASCAR's Sportsman Division. He also worked as a fabricator, volunteer firefighter, and preacher. He also volunteered at a local racing school occasionally and was a devout Baptist, serving as the youth minister at his local church, serving as a mentor for many of the children there. He was nicknamed ‚ÄúBubby‚Äù due to his large, intimidating stature. By all reports, he was an extremely kind man, sometimes referred to as a gentle giant. He was married to Jennifer, a young woman he met on pit road in 1990 before one of his races while she was looking for autographs. They lived together in Mint Hill, NC and had no kids. Career While little is known about his career, it‚Äôs known that Russell independently owned and drove the #57 car. Most of his career, he was a middle of the pack driver and hardly got attention from the media, but he started making a name for himself in 1995 with strong runs. He received sponsorship from local companies such as Mullis Well Drilling, Quesco, and later in his career, Hendrix Office Machines.

The crash occurred on lap 17 of the 67-lap event; up to that point, Phillips was in tenth place and had led three laps. His Oldsmobile was hit by the car of Steven Howard, who steered high to avoid a two-car spinout.

Until 1996, NASCAR cars were not yet required to be equipped with the \\"Earnhardt bar\\", a roof-support bar running down the middle of the windshield, designed to prevent fatal roof collapse in roof-first accidents. His roll bars failed to protect the roof; both the roll bars and the roof itself were sheared completely off the car, exposing the interior of the driver compartment and grinding Phillips and the compartment against the wall and fence, killing him instantly. When the vehicle came back down onto the track on its wheels, there was a massive \\"gaping hole\\" where the roof had been. Phillips, whose body was mutilated by the track's steel catch fence and a caution light fixture at high speed, was both dismembered and decapitated, in what a photographer on-scene described, \\"as gruesome a wreck as I can ever recall\\".Sportsman Driver Killed At Charlotte In video footage taken at the scene of the accident, the first rescuer is initially shown running to the car, then immediately turning away after seeing Phillips' body and realizing the hopelessness of any attempt at resuscitation.

The Racecourse was inaugurated on 25 June 1812, by The Mauritius Turf Club (MTC) which was founded earlier in the same year by Edward Alured Draper, who served in different capacities, namely as Chief of Police, Colonial Secretary, Collector of Customs, Civil engineer, Registrar of Slaves, Magistrate and Colonial Treasurer.The Mauritius Turf Club is the oldest horse- racing club in the Southern Hemisphere and the second oldest in the world. The race track follows a very selective right hand oval path and is relatively small in size, with a circumference of 1,298 meters (4,258.5 ft) and width between 12 and 14 meters (39 and 46 feet). The home-straight extends uphill and is 225 meters (738 ft) long. When Mauritius gained independence on 12 March 1968, the event including the flag hoisting ceremony was held here. Since then and for many years, the racecourse has seen the annual celebration of the accession to independence. Today, the Champ de Mars attracts tens of thousands of people on each racing day during the racing season from late March to early December and has become the ultimate meeting place for racing fanatics from all over the island and even from abroad. The track has also played a fundamental role in propelling horse racing as the most popular sport and form of entertainment among the local population. History Before 1810, the area was a military training ground for French troops. The aim of the founders of the Mauritius Turf Club to set up horse racing at the Champ de Mars was to reconcile the French settlers with the English administration who had conquered the island in December 1810. They were convinced that the convivial atmosphere of horse racing would foster unity between the two communities and ensure social peace and harmony after years of fighting in the Indian Ocean. The new Governor, Sir Robert Farquhar and his wife of French origin, Maria Lautour, actively supported the organization of horse racing, the latter offering the first gold cup after the club's history to mark the occasion. When he came to Mauritius, Colonel Edward Draper enthusiastically promoted horse racing at the Champ de Mars for some twenty years, racing his own thoroughbreds, often riding them in competition, to the point that he became known as the ‚ÄúFather‚Äù of the Mauritius Turf Club. The main road leading to it is a landmark known to racing enthusiasts as ‚ÄúRue Government‚Äù, Champ de Mars racecourse is nestled at the foot of lovely hills. It is the oldest racecourse in the southern hemisphere and the second oldest in the world. Within its premises stands a statue of King Edward VII by the sculptor Prosper d‚Äô√âpinay, and the Malartic Tomb, an obelisk to a French governor. In the 19th century, the only permanent boxes at the Champ de Mars were those reserved for the Governor, the Mayor of Port Louis and MTC officials. Temporary boxes were built and hired on the spot on race days, and over the years, new boxes were erected. In 1906 the MTC purchased a wooden house at 26, Pope Hennessy Street, Port Louis and it served as MTC offices for about forty years. Permanent stands were built in 1909 and they were improved in 1927, 1939 and 1954. During the past decades, new facilities were added while retaining the colonial aspects of the racecourse. The attendance record at the Champ de Mars was set in 1984 when more than 100,000 people turned up at the Maiden Cup, the most prestigious race in the Mauritian racing calendar. Nippy Regen, owned by the Gujadhur stable, won the race and was ridden by Adrian Walkinshaw.

In the book, Junie's whole face was scarred but was changed to only one side for the film. Rehearsals for the film took place in June 1969 during which time, Minnell's mother, Judy Garland, died. Filming started in July 1969 at the Salem Hospital in Salem, Massachusetts. Filming continued until September 1969 and was shot in Massachusetts, including Hammond museum, as well as in Naples, Florida; Sequoia National Park; Santa Monica Pier; and the Kona Kai Club on Shelter Island, San Diego. The scene in the cemetery where Minnelli appeared nude was filmed at the Blue Hills Cemetery in Braintree, Massachusetts and resulted in a misdemeanor complaint from family members of those buried there. A \\"Liza Minnelli Bill\\" was introduced in Massachusetts the following year with a six month prison sentence and $1,000 fine for anyone shooting in cemeteries without permission.

Roger Ebert was one of the few critics who did not dislike the film and particularly praised the performances of Minelli, Coco and Moore. Ebert summed up his review: > The ending is not convincing, alas; we're never quite sure what happened to > the Howard character, or why. And surely in 1970 people don't make tender > speeches and then die on cue in their lover's arms. But, on balance, the > movie works and tells us something about three or four good people who are > trying to cope. That's enough.

Javanese culture is the culture of the Javanese ethnic group in Indonesia, part of the Indonesian culture. Javanese culture is centered in the Central Java, Yogyakarta and East Java provinces of Indonesia. Due to various migrations, it can also be found in other parts of the world, such as Suriname (where 15% of the population are of Javanese descent), the broader Indonesian archipelago region, Cape Malay, Malaysia, Singapore, Netherlands and other countries. The migrants bring with them various aspects of Javanese cultures such as Gamelan music, traditional dances and art of Wayang kulit shadow play. The migration of Javanese people westward has created the coastal Javanese culture that is distinct from inland Sundanese culture in West Java. Being the largest ethnic group, the Javanese culture and people influence Indonesian politics and culture, a process sometimes described as Javanization. Literature The five Pandawa brothers from the Hindu epic Mahabharata, narrated in the Javanese Wayang kulit. Javanese literature tradition is among the earliest and the oldest surviving literature traditions in Indonesia. The translations of Hindu epic Ramayana and Mahabharata into old Javanese language took place during the era of Medang Kingdom and Kediri kingdom around 9th to 11th century. The Smaradhana is also composed during Kediri kingdom, and it became the prelude of later Panji cycles that spread as far as Siam and Cambodia. Other literary works include, Ken Arok and Ken Dedes, based upon Pararaton, the story of the orphan who usurped his king, and married the queen of the ancient Javanese kingdom. During the reign of Majapahit several notable works was produced. Nagarakretagama describes Majapahit during its height. Tantu Pagelaran dated from Majapahit period explained the mythical origin of the island and its volcanic nature. Kakawin Sutasoma, written by Mpu Tantular during the reign of the Majapahit. It is the source of the motto of Indonesia, Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, which is usually translated as Unity in Diversity, although literally it means '(Although) in pieces, yet One'. The kakawin teaches religious tolerance, specifically between the Hindu and Buddhist religions. Other works includes Babad Tanah Jawi is a literature which relates to the spread of Islam in Java and Babad Dipanagara which tells the story of Prince Diponegoro. Spirituality =Religion= =Majapahit empire= Historically, Javanese follow a syncretic form of Hinduism, Buddhism and Kebatinan. The Majapahit empire religious tolerance in their society can be summed as Bhinn√™ka tunggal ika tan hana dharma mangrwa or They are indeed different, but they are of the same kind, as there is no duality in Truth. Starting from the 15th century, Islam and Christianity came to Java and slowly spread. Due to internal and external conflicts, Majapahit collapsed in the 16th century. Islam spread quickly under the new Islamic monarchs. While the spread of Christianity was supervised by colonial powers. All the new religions were not taken literally but instead interpreted by the Javanese according to the Javanese traditional values, creating a new set of religious beliefs unique to local culture. =Islam= Islam first came in contact with Java during Majapahit periods, when they traded or made tributary relations with various states like Perlak and Samudra Pasai in modern-day Aceh. Sufism played a major role in affecting the Islamic understanding of Javanese in the fourtheenth century and affected the local understanding of afterlife and spirits, such as jinn, demons and ghosts.Muhaimin, A.G. (2006). The Islamic Traditions of Cirebon: Ibadat and Adat among Javanese Muslims. ANU E Press. pp. 35. . The introduction of Salafi Islam to the island by the new Muslim monarchs was not always peaceful however, Javanese, nobles and peasants who rejected the new rulers were either conquered or fled to neighboring Bali where they contributed heavily to the Balinese Hindu religion and culture. Some Hindus who remained in Java retreated themself to more remote area such as Tenger near the Mount Bromo to avoid proselytizion. During the islamization of Java, Sunan Kalijaga was one of the Walisanga which was active in promoting a more moderate form of Islam in Java, he was later appointed as advisor in the new Mataram Sultanate. Most Javanese follow the Shafi‚Äòite tradition of Sunnism, although mostly following an esoteric interpretation of their religion, while only 5-10 percent of Javanese follow puritanian traditions. Salafi Muslims are the strongest in northern coast bordering the Java Sea, where Islam was first brought to the island. =Christianity= A minority of Javanese also follow Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism), which are rather concentrated in Central Java (particularly Surakarta, Magelang and Yogyakarta for Catholicism). =Hindu- Buddhist= Another minority are Buddhists and Hindus, they are mostly found in East Java, The Javanese Tengger tribe is still practicing Javanese-Hindu till today. =Kebatinan= Kebatinan are principles embodying a search for the inner self but at the core is the concept of the peace of mind, connection with the universe, and with an Almighty God. Although Kebatinan is not strictly a religious affiliation, it addresses ethical and spiritual values as inspired by Javanese tradition. It is not a religion in usual sense of the word, like Islam, Judaism, or Christianity. There are no scriptures such as the Bible or the Qur'an, nor are there prophets. During the Soeharto era, this minority is acknowledged and protected as \\"penganut kepercayaan\\". Ceremonies Many traditional Javanese customs or festivals such as meditation, slametan, naloni mitoni, patangpuluhdinanan, nyatus, nyewu have their roots in the kebatinan belief. Javanese of other beliefs modify them accordingly, incorporating Muslims, Christian or Hindu prayers instead. Details of the ceremonies differ from one community to the other. =Grebeg Maulud= Grebeg Maulud at Surakarta Grebeg Maulud is a traditional ceremony held by the royal court of Keraton Surakarta and Jogjakarta, to commemorate the birth of Islam's holy messenger, Muhammad. This ceremony was first held during the reign of the Demak Dynasty dating back to the 15th century. The ceremony starts with prayers in the grand mosques, a parade and a carnival of the people. =Javanese wedding= There are several variations of Javanese wedding, depending on the custom and social standing of the couple. Popular variation includes Surakartan, Jogjakarta, Paes Kesatrian, and Paes Ageng. The wedding rituals will include Siraman, Midodareni, Peningsetan, Ijab (for Muslims) or wedding sacrament (for Christians). Siraman The bride and groom to be are showered at their respective homes, by families and close friends. Prayers are also given hoping for a good tide. Midodareni A night before a Javanese wedding, the bride-to-be has her last dinner with her family, female friends are also invited. Traditional cuisine and prayers are given. Later, the groom's family will also come, bringing Peningsets (offerings to the bride family to seal the tomorrows wedding) in which the bride-to-be is hidden in her room. Only the female relatives of the groom can visit the bride-to-be. =Naloni Mitoni= Held for the first pregnancy of a woman, when the pregnancy is in its seventh month. Family and close friends are invited. The mother-to-be is shrouded with seven layers of batik, symbolizing hope for a good child and delivery. Prayers and traditional food are also served. =Selapanan= Held when a child is 35 days, a ritual celebrating the new life. Family members and close friends will come to the event. The child's hair and nails are shaved. prayers, religious readings and a slametan is a common part of the event. After the event, cakes, sweets and eggs (symbolising the new life) will be shared. =Tedhak Sithen= Held when a child is around eight months old. Family members are invited, to celebrate a child starts walking. =Khitan= For a boy, khitan, or circumcision, is an important transition toward adulthood. The ritual usually held when the boy is 6 to 12 years old. Following the circumcision it is customary to sacrifice a goat, hold a slametan and wayang kulit (shadow puppet) performance. Circumcision is one factor that differentiate the Javanese with related Balinese and Tenggerese, which still predominantly Hindu. =Ruwatan Gembel= The day Hindu children of the Dieng community shave their hair. A large offering ceremony to the Gods at the temples are given. Afterwards the community arranges a festival. Tourists normally flock to see the event. =Slametan= Prayers to hope for good tidings. Normally tumpeng is served. =Patangpuluhdinanan, Nyatus, Nyewu= Prayers given on the 40th, 100th, and 1000th days since a person deceased. =Nyekar= Before the month of Ramadhan, family members visit the graves of their loved ones, praying for their well being. =Labuan= A kejawen ceremony, where kebatinan believers throws a shroud to the sea or mountain, to throw away bad luck. Social structure Javanese priyayi and servants, 1865. The American anthropologist Clifford Geertz in the 1960s divided the Javanese community into three aliran or \\"streams\\": santri, abangan and priyayi. According to him, the Santri followed an orthodox interpretation Islam, the abangan was the followed a syncretic form of Islam that mixed Hindu and animist elements (often termed Kejawen), and the priyayi was the nobility. But today the Geertz opinion is often opposed because he mixed the social groups with belief groups. It was also difficult to apply this social categorisation in classing outsiders, for example other non-indigenous Indonesians such as persons of Arab, Chinese and Indian descent. Social stratification is much less rigid in northern coast area, which is much more egalitarian. =Sultans= The Keratons, the royal palaces of the Yogyakarta Sultanate and the Surakarta Sunanate, are the central of the Javanese culture and social events. Although they are not ruling monarchs, they are still highly revered and look upon in the society. When addressing to the Sultan, a person is expected to speak in the refined \\"kromo inggil\\", but today formal bahasa Indonesia is also accepted. Not all Javanese were once subjects of the Yogyakarta Sultanate and the Surakarta Sunanate. =Priyayi= The Priyayis were once part of the ruling aristocrats, they have little function today. Some of Indonesia's ruling political figures are descendants of the priyayis. They are now part of the general society and work in numerous fields. =Villages= Villages are an important administrative unit in Java. It is divided into two types: Desa with elective leadership, usually in rural areas, and Kelurahan, where the leadership is appointed by Indonesian government, usually in urban areas. Village administration is managed by officers, still called with their traditional Javanese names. These are lurah (village chief), assisted by offices of carik (village secretary), kamituwa (officer for social affairs), jagabaya (officer for security), and modin (office for Islamic affairs and rituals, derived from Arabic Imam ad-Din, or leader of the faith). These officers traditionally didn't get paid in cash, but allotted a portion in the village's public land to be farmed, called tanah bengkok. In modern-day Indonesia, Village chief is elected directly by universal suffrage of the villagers, who are 17 years old and above, or already married. As literacy rate was low before independence, it is customary for the rival candidates to use common items as their campaign symbol, such as fruits, vegetables or traditional foods. The village chief election is usually non-partisan. =Family= Culturally, Javanese people adopt a bilateral kinship system, with male and female descendants having equal importance. As such there is no preference on having a male heir like paternalistic cultures in India or China. It is not customary for Javanese to have a surname. Women have a high degree of autonomy and are respected in Javanese culture. In a traditional marriage, it is the groom's family who chooses the bride from a selection of prospects. Prior to the wedding, the groom's family will give the bride's family a dowry. Afterwards, the bride's family is responsible for paying for the wedding. The groom's family can help financially, but they are not obliged to do so. Traditionally, divorce is not acceptable, but it was acceptable for the husband to take a second wife or a mistress. Young Javanese normally do not follow these customs, and today most Javanese women will resist infidelity and opt for a divorce. Divorce is becoming acceptable in Java.

Javanese is a member of the Austronesian family of languages and is closely related to, but distinct from, other languages of Indonesia. It is notable for its great number of nearly ubiquitous Sanskrit loans, found especially in literary Javanese. This is due to the long history of Hindu and Buddhist influences in Java. Most Javanese in Indonesia are bilingual, being fluent in Indonesian and Javanese. In a public poll held circa-1990, approximately 12% of Javanese used Indonesian, around 18% used both Javanese and Indonesian, and the rest used Javanese exclusively. The Javanese language was commonly written with a script descended from the Brahmi script, natively known as Hanacaraka or Carakan. Upon Indonesian independence it was replaced with a form of the Latin alphabet. While Javanese was not made an official language of Indonesia, it has the status of 'regional language' for communication in the Javanese-majority regions. The language also can be viewed as an 'ethnic language' because it is one of the defining characteristics of the Javanese ethnic identity. Occupations Village in the slope of Mount Semeru, East Java. Colonial period painting. In Indonesia, Javanese can be found in all occupations, especially in the government and the military. =Farming= Traditionally, most Javanese are farmers. This was especially common because of the fertile volcanic soil in Java. The most important agricultural commodity is rice. In 1997, it was estimated that Java produced 55% of Indonesian output of the crop. Most farmers work small-scale rice field, with around 42% of farmers cultivate less than 0.5 hectare of rice field. In region where soil is less fertile of where rainy season is short, other staple crops is cultivated, such as cassava. =Blacksmithing= A decorative kris with a figure of Semar as the handle. The bilah has thirteen luk. For the Javanese, blacksmiths are traditionally valued. Some blacksmiths fast, and meditate to reach perfection. Javanese blacksmiths provide a range of tools such as farming equipment and to cultural items such as gamelan instruments and kris. Majapahit rigidly use fire-arms and cannonade as a feature of warfare. The Javanese bronze breech-loaded swivel-gun, more correctly known as a meriam was used ubiquitously by the Majapahit navy and unfortunately pirates and rival lords. The demise of the Majapahit empire also cause the flight of disaffected skilled bronze cannon-smiths to Brunei, modern Sumatra and Malaysia, and the Philippines lead to near universal use of the swivel-gun, especially on trade vessels to protect against prevalent marauding pirates, in the Makassar Strait.Thomas Stamford Raffles, The History of Java, Oxford University Press, 1965, , 1088 pages. Keris is an important item, with many heirloom kris made by master blacksmiths holding significant historical value. The design of the keris, with its snake like blade, is to tear apart an opponents abdomen, making the injury more severe. While the Javanese canting, enables them to make intricate Batik. Kota Gede is famous for its silverworks and silver handicrafts. =Batik= Batik textiles are a traditional pastime for women, although some villages specialize in batik, such as Pekalongan, Kauman, Kampung Taman, and Laweyan. =Wood carving= Javanese woodworkers making traditional masks during the Dutch East Indies era. The Javanese art of wood carving is traditionally applied to various cultural attributes such as statues, (wayang-)dolls, and masks. Calendar :See Javanese calendar The Javanese calendar is used by Javanese people concurrently with two other calendars, the Gregorian calendar and the Islamic calendar. Gregorian calendar is the official calendar of Indonesia while the Islamic calendar is used by Muslims and Indonesian government for religious worship and deciding relevant Islamic holidays. Javanese calendar presently used mostly for cultural events (such as Satu Sura). The present Javanese calendar system is a lunar calendar adopted by Sultan Agung in 1633, based on the Islamic calendar. Previously, Javanese people used a solar system based on the Hindu calendar. Unlike many other calendars, the Javanese calendar uses a 5-day week known as the Pasaran cycle. This is still in use today and superimposed with 7-day week of the Gregorian calendar and Islamic calendar to become what is known as the 35-day Wetonan cycle. Art Javanese origin artforms are among the best known in Indonesia and the whole archipelago. The famous Javanese wayang puppetry culture was influenced by Hindu and Buddhist traditions. The Wayang repertoire stories, lakon, are mostly based on epics from India; Ramayana and Mahabharata. These epics and stories influenced wayang puppetry as well as Javanese classical dances. The influences from Islam and the Western world also can be found. The art of batik, and kris dagger are of Javanese origin. =Music= Gamelan musical ensembles are found in both Java and Bali. All of these artforms holds important position, and function within Javanese culture and tradition. Architecture Traditional Javanese house. Candi Plaosan in Prambanan (9th century). Throughout their long history, the Javanese have produced many important buildings, ranging from Hindu monuments, Buddhist stupa, mortuary temples, palace complexes, and mosques. The paragon of religious monuments are Hindu temple of Prambanan and Buddhist temple of Borobudur. Both of them 9th centuries temples which are UNESCO World Heritage Site. Both are located near city of Yogyakarta in the slope of Mount Merapi. Meanwhile, example of secular building can be seen in ruins of former capital city of Majapahit Kingdom (14th to 16th century AD) in Trowulan, East Java. The complex covers an area of 11 km x 9 km. It consists of various brick building, ranging from 20 to 40 meter-wide canal, purification pools, temples and iconic split gates. The capital complex is currently being considered as a candidate for becoming a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Traditional Javanese building can be identified by its trapezoid shaped roof supported by wooden pillars. Another common feature in Javanese building is pendopo, a pavilion with open-side and four large pillars. The pillars and other part of the buildings can be richly carved. This architecture style can be found at kraton or palace of the Sultanates of Yogyakarta (palaces of Hamengkubuwono and Pakualaman) and Surakarta (palaces of Pakubuwono and Mangkunegaran). Traditional mosques in Java maintain a distinctive Javanese style. The pendopo model is used as main feature of the mosque as its prayer hall. A trapezoidal roof is used instead of the more typically Muslim dome. These roofs are often multi-tiered and tiled. In addition to not using domes, traditional Javanese mosques also often lack minarets. The split gate from earlier Hindu-Buddhist period is still used in many mosques and public buildings in Java. Some notable examples of mosques using traditional Javanese architecture include Agung Demak Mosque, Menara Kudus Mosque and the Grand Mosque of Banten. The Kudus Mosque is also of note because it incorporates Hindu-style stone architecture.  Names  Javanese do not usually have family names or surnames. Many have just a single name. For example, Sukarno or Suharto. Javanese names may come from traditional Javanese languages, many of which are derived from Sanskrit. Names with the prefix Su-,which means good, are very popular. After the advent of Islam, many Javanese began to use Arabic names, especially coast populations, where Islamic influences are stronger. Commoners usually only have one-word names, while nobilities use two-or-more-word names, but rarely a surname. Due to the influence of other cultures, many people started using names from other languages, mainly European languages. Christian Javanese usually use Latin baptism names followed by a traditional Javanese name. Some people use a patronymic. For example, Abdurrahman Wahid's name is derived from his father's name (Wahid Hasyim) who was an independence fighter and minister. In turn, Wahid Hasyim's name was derived from that of his father: Hasyim Asyari, a famous cleric and founder of the Nahdlatul Ulama organisation. Cuisine Example of Javanese cuisine. Clockwise: fried tempeh, mlinjo crackers, gudeg with rice wrapped in teak leaf, green chili sambal and sliced lime. Nasi tumpeng, the quintessentially Javanese rice dish, symbolises the volcano. Javanese cuisine and culture place an important role in rice, the staple food of the island. Among Javanese it is considered not to have a meal if a person hasn't eaten rice yet. It is also important part of identity that differentiate Javanese with foreigners that eat bread (the Europeans) and resident of other island who eat sago (for example Moluccans). Rice is also symbol of development and prosperity, while cassava and tuber is associated with poverty. Javanese cuisine is varied by regions. Eastern Javanese cuisine has preference for more salty and hot foods, while the Central Javanese prefer sweeter foods. Famous food in Javanese cuisine is for example Rujak Cingur, a marinated cow lips and noses, served with vegetable, shrimp prawn and peanut sauce with chili. Rojak Cingur is considered traditional food of Surabaya in East Java. Gudeg is a traditional food from Yogyakarta and Central Java which is made from young Nangka (jack fruit) boiled for several hours with palm sugar, and coconut milk. Pecel, a type of peanut sauce with chili is a common ingredient in Javanese cuisine. It is used in various type of Rujak and Gado-gado. It can also be used as stand alone sauce with rice and prawn, egg and vegetables as Nasi Pecel (Pecel rice). Tumpeng, is a rice served in the shape of a conical volcano, usually with rice colored yellow using turmeric. It is an important part of ceremony in Java. Tumpeng served in landmark events such as birthday, moving house, or other ceremonies. Traditionally, Tumpeng is served alongside fried chicken, boiled egg, vegetables, goat meat on a round plate made from bamboo called besek. A notable food in Java is tempeh, a meat substitute made from soy bean fermented with mold. It is a staple source of protein in Java and popular in the world as an excellent meat substitute for vegetarians.

The battle was critical in determining the outcome of the Battle of Jinzhou and, consequently, that of the entire Liaoshen Campaign. The battle is more commonly known as the blocking battle at Tashan (), and is widely regarded by the communists as the first of the three most crucial blocking operations (along with the Battle of Heishan a week later and the Battle of Xudong from the Huaihai Campaign) during the Chinese Civil War. The name \\"Tashan\\" (), literally translated to \\"Pagoda Mountain\\", was short for Tashanbao (, meaning \\"Pagoda Mountain fort\\"). Contrary to its name, there were neither pagoda nor mountains and the only defensive bunkers were the ones hastily built by the communists temporarily for the upcoming battle. The place was actually a village of 100 or so households, some 30 km away from Jinzhou, with the main road to Jinzhou passing directly through the center of the village. Prelude After encircling Jinzhou, the communists were facing an incoming Nationalist reinforcement of a total of 11 divisions (not counting the Nationalist air and naval assets), and were well aware of the importance of stopping Nationalist reinforcements from reaching Jinzhou. The PLA deployed a total of eight divisions and an artillery brigade at Tashan, with Cheng Zihua (), the commander of the Northeast Field Army's 2nd Corps, in charge. In order to better assist local commanders, Luo Ronghuan got approval from Lin Biao to send Su Jing (), a senior staff officer at general headquarters of the communist force in Northeast China, to Tashan. However, the local communist commanders, especially those of 4th Column, resented Luo Ronghuan‚Äôs decision to send Su Jing. After he arrived at the headquarters of 4th Column, they jokingly referred to him as the equivalent of an ancient Chinese imperial army overseer, feeling that Luo Ronghuan and Lin Biao were doubtful they were competent enough to accomplish their assigned mission. Luckily, the excellent work of the political commissar of the 4th Column, Mo Wenhua (), was able to resolve the issue and the communists avoided the kind of factional disputes that existed in the nationalist camp. Order of battle Attackers: National Revolutionary Army (Nationalist) order of battle: *The 54th Army (3 divisions) *The 62nd Army (3 divisions) *2 divisions from the 39th Army *21st Division of the 92nd Army *The 62nd Division *The Independent 95th Division *Naval and air assets Defenders: People's Liberation Army (Communist) order of battle: *The 4th Column (3 divisions) *The 11th Column (3 divisions) *Rehe Independent 4th Division *Rehe Independent 6th Division *An artillery brigade Battle The battle started before dawn on October 10, 1948, at 3:00 AM, with the Nationalists successfully launching a surprise attack with numerical and technical superiority, taking the Fishing Mountain (Da Yu Shan,)Island at low tide. Da Yu Shan Island was a critical position, in that whoever controlled the islands would threaten the flank of Tashan. The grave danger was realized by the commander of the communist 4th Column, Wu Kehua (), who immediately ordered a counterattack to retake the island. The mission was successfully accomplished, and the island remained firmly in communist hands for the remainder of the battle. Although Nationalist aircraft dropped over 5,000 heavy bombs on communist positions‚Äîwhich were also pounded by Nationalist naval shelling‚Äîthe attack was not well coordinated because Nationalist commanders on the ground lacked the authority to command air and naval assets, which were under the direct control of Chiang Kai-shek and his high command. As a result, the communists were able to dig in underground without suffering significant casualties, despite most of their fortifications above the ground being demolished by Nationalist attacks from air and sea. Despite Nationalist encouragements including a half-million-dollar incentive reward for each troop, repeated Nationalist charges against communist positions were beaten back‚Äîthe communists even at one point used Nationalist corpses to improvise temporary fortifications, which proved to be a psychological shock to the attacking Nationalist troops. As a result, the Nationalists were unable to advance any further towards Jinzhou. On October 15 the news of the fall of Jinzhou had reached Nationalist reinforcements at Tashan. Realizing there was no longer any reason for further attack, and fearful of an all-out counterattack by the communists‚Äîwho now had additional troops freed up from the conquest of Jinzhou to reinforce Tashan‚Äîthe Nationalists made a hasty retreat at noon, leaving behind a total of 6,549 killed. The battle concluded with a victory for the communists, whose casualties included 7,827 killed, 15,922 wounded, three captured and 22 missing. Outcome The communists' successful repelling of Nationalist forces at Tashan was one of the most important factors contributing to the Nationalist loss in the Battle of Jinzhou, and consequently the nationalist defeat in the Liaoshen Campaign. It could be argued that the Nationalist failure had much more to do with internal power struggles and factional problems among themselves, and Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist generalissimo, came in for some blame. The communists would have had little chance of stopping Nationalist reinforcements if Wei Lihuang‚Äôs original battle plan had been carried out by the capable commander, Chen Tie (), Wei Lihuang‚Äôs deputy. Putting the deputy commander-in-chief in command illustrated that the local Nationalists realized the importance of this battle, but such moves were completely negated by the Nationalist supreme commander himself. Chiang Kai-shek selected Que Hanqian () to replace Chen Tie, and Que Hanqian was directly commanded by Chiang, not taking orders from Wei Lihuang; because of this, the original Nationalist plan was ruined. Chiang‚Äôs move also alienated other Nationalists in Northeast China, who felt that he did not trust them and judged them incompetent. As a result, they lost the incentive to work with Que Hanqian, because if he achieved success in defeating the communists, it would only strengthen Chiang‚Äôs original negative opinion of them. The commander of the Nationalist 62nd Army, Lin Weichou (), had openly clashed with Que Hanqian and refused to take orders from him. It wasn't only the commanders sent by Chiang Kai-shek who could not get along with the local commanders; they also could not get along with each other. Que Hanqian was constantly interfered with by Luo Qi (), the other senior commander was also sent by Chiang, and Luo Qi constantly filed secret reports to Chiang informing on other commanders‚Äô behavior, including Que Hanqian, who was accused by Luo Qi of not being enthusiastic about his mission. It was obvious that Nationalist commanders were not able to effectively conduct operations under such conditions. Not only were the Nationalist frontline commanders unable to effectively command their army units, they were also completely incapable of directing any air and naval assets. Chiang had ordered the Nationalist air force and navy to provide support, but without giving any authority to commanders on the ground to use them directly; even Que Hanqian and Luo Qi could not direct air and naval assets without going through Chiang first. As a result, Nationalist naval shelling and air strikes were not coordinated with ground offensives to any great effect. Another reason for ineffective Nationalist air and naval operations was that all Nationalist officers, including Chiang himself, had doubts as to the success of the mission, and the Nationalists were faced with a dilemma: should they risk the few valuable air and naval assets they had to a plausible lost cause (especially when the overall situation in Northeast China would not change for the better even if the battle was won), or should they preserve these resources to be used elsewhere where the Nationalists had brighter prospect? The decision was difficult and certainly limited the usage of these assets. The personality of the Nationalist commanders was also a contributor factor to their defeat. Hou Jingru () and Hui De‚Äôan (), the commander and deputy commander of the Qinhuangdao-Jinxi garrison, were capable commanders originally tasked to assist Chen Tie. However, despite their excellence, Hou and Hui were extremely loyal and blindly obedient to Chiang Kai-shek and would not voice any complaints regarding their superior's mistakes. This was evidenced by the fact that, after the 21st Division of the NRA 92nd Army under the command of Hou Jingru was annihilated in the Autumn Offensive of 1947 in Northeast China (which was not his fault), Hou did not voice any complaints to his superior Chen Cheng and Chiang. As a capable military commander, Hou Jingru had reached the same conclusion as his superior Chen Cheng: Northeast China was a lost cause for the Nationalists, who would be much better off if they had given up the region and use the freed troops elsewhere where they were in better positions, and recapture the region when things had turned better. However, unlike his outspoken superior Chen Cheng, who openly advocated this idea, Hou kept quiet and faithfully carried on to the end the impossible tasks set by Chiang. Hou had earned Chiang‚Äôs deep trust, but this would come at a heavy price: when Chiang personally sent two of his senior officers to replace the much more capable Chen Tie, Hou and Hui did not voice their concern regarding two new commanders' incompetence. At the same time, Hou and Hui were also aware of the Nationalist problems they could not solve, and not wanting to be scapegoats for failure, the two chose to wait by not going to help the two new senior commanders, who out of jealousy did not want them to be involved anyway. The primary reason Chiang Kai-shek decided to intrude on the chain of command by sending two of his own senior officers to take over command of the battle was the result of difference in strategic vision between him and Wei Lihuang, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces in Northeast China. Chiang was still obsessed with holding as much land as long as he possibly could, while Wei Lihuang believed that Nationalists should conserve manpower even if that meant ceding lands temporarily. However, for Chiang and most of the Nationalist high command, surrendering lands was politically unacceptable.

Life  Besiki was born and raised in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital. He came of a noble family, which claimed descent from the ancient city of Gibeon (Georgian: Gabaoni) in Palestine. The poet himself frequently used the surname Gabaoni, a variant of Gabashvili. Besiki's father, Zakaria, was a Georgian Orthodox priest and a confessor of King Teimuraz II. Zakaria was excommunicated and banished in 1764, but Besiki was allowed by King Erekle II to stay at the royal court where he received his education and began his career of a minstrel, his early style being influenced by Persian poetry and his older contemporary, the polyglot Tbilisite Armenian poet Sayat-Nova. Despite his younger age, Besiki gained many enemies at the court due largely to his satires and, most importantly, his insulting attacks on Catholicos Anton I. Rumors in Georgia have also linked Besiki with Erekle‚Äôs sister Ana, who was about 28 years older, mainly on the grounds of his love poem ·Éì·Éî·Éì·Éù·É§·Éê·Éö·É° ·Éê·Éú·Éê·Éñ·Éî·Éì (\\"On Queen Ana\\"). In 1777, he was accused of impiety by Catholicos Anton, who named him as the Antichrist and denounced him to the King. As a result of this conflict, Besiki was banned from Tbilisi and had to move to the Kingdom of Imereti (western Georgia), where he was welcomed and appointed a chancellor by Solomon I. Later, he was involved in the brief war for the throne of Imereti after Solomon‚Äôs death and served as a diplomat under the next Imeretian king, Solomon II. Again, Besiki found himself implicated in the court‚Äôs intrigues. His troubadour affection to Solomon II‚Äôs younger wife, Ana, n√©e Orbeliani, might well have been the reason for his being sent by the king on dangerous missions, the last of which to Imperial Russia, was intended to secure Russian protection for Imereti during the Russo-Turkish War (1787‚Äì1792). For three years, he accompanied the Russian Field Marshal Potyomkin in the campaign against the Ottoman Empire, and suddenly died at Ia≈üi, Moldavia (25 January 1791), where he was buried.Rayfield, Donald (2000), The Literature of Georgia: A History: 2nd edition, pp. 124-6. Routledge, . In 2019, a statue of Besiki was inaugurated in Iasi, Romania.Besiki statue opened in Romania TV Imedi  Poetry  Due to Besiki‚Äôs turbulent life and permanent travels abroad, many of his manuscripts were irretrievably lost. He died unpublished, but hundreds of manuscript copies circulated for decades after his death; the titles and notes to many poems may be inventions of amateur copyists. Besiki's diverse poetic legacy is notable for its sheer musicality and spontaneity.Mikaberidze, Alexander (2007). \\"Besiki (Bessarion Gabashvili)\\". Dictionary of Georgian National Biography .

His heroic poetry includes the poems ·Éê·É°·Éû·Éò·Éú·É´·Éò·É°·Éê·Éó·Éï·Éò·É° (\\"On the Battle of Aspindza\\") and ·É†·É£·ÉÆ·Éò·É° ·Éù·Éõ·Éò (\\"The Battle of Rukhi\\"), both of them dedicated to the Georgian military victories over the Turkish and Abkhaz- Circassian forces, respectively. In \\"On the Battle of Aspindza\\", Besiki praises the martial prowess of the Georgian army at the Battle of Aspindza (1770) and eulogizes military talents of Prince David Orbeliani, a Georgian vanguard commander and himself a poet of some talent.Baramidze, A.G., Gamezardashvili, D.M. (2001), Georgian Literature, p. 45. The Minerva Group, Inc., . At the same time, the poem is a graphic denunciation of the Russian commander Todtleben who had abandoned his Georgian allies just before the battle. Besiki also mastered satirical poetry, ·É†·É´·Éê·Éö-·Éì·Éî·Éì·Éê·Éõ·Éó·Éò·Éö·Éò·Éê·Éú·Éò (\\"The Mother- in-Law and the Daughter-in-Law\\"), and ·É≠·Éê·Éë·É£·Éê ·Éù·É†·Éë·Éî·Éö·Éò·Éê·Éú·Éñ·Éî (\\"On Chabua Orbeliani\\"), being noteworthy examples. The poet made use of some new methods in versification, in the composition, and coined some new words, renovating and enriching Georgian poetry with fresh metaphors. Besiki has left a remarkable trace in the history of Georgian literature. In particular, his poetry heavily influenced Georgian Romanticists of the early 19th century and resounded again in their works on several occasions.

Prelude Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also rooted from the fact that Chiang Kai-shek had realized that his nationalist regime simply had neither the sufficient troops nor enough transportation assets to deploy his troops into the Japanese-occupied regions of China. Unwilling to let the communists who had already dominated most of the rural regions in China to further expand their territories by accepting the Japanese surrender and thus would consequently control the Japanese occupied regions, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Japanese and their turncoat Chinese puppet regime not to surrender to the communists and kept their fighting capabilities to ‚Äúmaintain order‚Äù in the Japanese occupied regions, fighting off the communists as necessary, until the final arrivals and completion of the deployment of the nationalist troops. As a result, most members of the Japanese puppet regimes and their military forces rejoined the nationalists. However, most of these former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime forces were not from Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs own clique, but instead, they were mainly consisted of troops of warlords who were only nominally under the Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs before World War II, since they were nationalists in name only and mostly maintained their independent and semi-independent status. These warlords were only interested in keeping their own power and defected to the Japanese side when Japanese invaders offered to let them keep their power in exchange for their collaborations. After World War II, these forces of former Japanese puppet regimes once again returned to the nationalist camp for the same reason they defected to the Japanese invaders. Obviously, it was difficult for Chiang to immediately get rid of these warlords for good as soon as they surrendered to Chiang and rejoined nationalists, because such move would alienate other factions within the nationalist ranks, and these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords could still help the nationalists to gain more territories by holding on to what was under their control until Chiang completed the deployment of his own troops to take over. Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs objective was to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, which proved to be an extremely fatal mistake for him and his nationalist regime later on, as shown in this conflict. Nationalist Strategy In accordance with his strategy to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, Chiang Kai-shek and his followers had hoped that these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords who rejoined the nationalists would be able to hold on to the regions long enough for Chiang to deploy his own troops by holding off communists. If the communists were victorious in such conflicts, however, the result would still benefit to Chiang and China because the power of these warlords would be reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, and the warlord problem plagued China for so long could thus be greatly reduced, while at the same time, communists would be weakened by the fights and Chiang's own troops would have easier time to take control. For the former nationalist turned Japanese puppet regime forces, these warlords and their troops had no problem of following Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs orders, and they were eager to prove themselves. These warlords and their troops were well aware that due to the collaboration with the Japanese invaders during the Second Sino-Japanese War, they were well hated by the general population in China, including those nationalists who refused to surrender to the enemy and fought the enemy until the eventual victory. Therefore, in the impending demilitarization after World War II, they were certainly be disarmed and discharged, which would probably be the best outcome and the power of these warlord would be reduced or even completely eliminated as a result. Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs ordering them not surrendering to the communists and fighting off the communists was a savior for them because by carrying out such orders, these warlords and their troops could legitimize themselves and thus retain their power by fighting the communists who were targeted as rebels by Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime. Communist Strategy The communist strategy was much simpler than that of the nationalists because there was not any huge division within the communist rank like that of the nationalist. The communists already earned considerable popular support by being the only Chinese force left in the region fighting the Japanese invaders and their puppet regime after the nationalist withdrew, and after successfully establishing communist bases in the rural regions where better life was provided to the general populace in comparison to that of Japanese occupied regions, the general Chinese populace agreed that the communists were well deserved to represent the China to accept the invaders‚Äô surrender in the region and takeover the regions occupied by the invaders. The battle After those former nationalist-turned Japanese puppet regime force had rejoined the nationalists after the end of World War II, they refused to surrender to the communists, the only Chinese force in the region according to Chiang Kai- shek‚Äôs order. This had obvious lead to numerous clashes with the communists and the local population that strongly supported the communists, and eventually the full scale battle between the two sides erupted in December 1945. The communist 7th Column of the New Fourth Army and the Independent Brigade of the communist Central Jiangsu Military District joined their forces in attacking the positions held by the former nationalist-turned Japanese puppet regime force who rejoined the nationalist, and with strong popular support, the communists easily overwhelmed their nationalist adversary and by the time the battle concluded in the end of December 1945, over sixteen major cities, towns and vast area along the highway from Yangzhou to Taizhou, Jiangsu including Yiling (ÂÆúÈôµ), Embankment Head (Tangtou, Â°òÂ§¥) and the Village of Guo (Guocun, ÈÉ≠Êùë) had fallen into communist hands. Outcome Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also showed that Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs attempt to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together proved to be a fatal mistake. Although the result of the campaign turned out exactly like Chiang Kai-shek and his subordinates had predicted, and consequently the power of the warlords in this region was indeed reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, so that the warlord problem plagued China for so long was thus reduced for this particular region, and Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs secondary objective was achieved here, any positive gains obtained by the nationalists were negated by the politic fallout. The reason was that this success of achieving the secondary objective came at a huge cost in nationalists‚Äô loss of popular support in this region formerly dominated by the Japanese, because the local population had already blamed nationalists for losing the regions to the Japanese invaders, while reassigning these former Japanese puppet regime forces as the nationalist forces to fight the communists, the only Chinese force left in the regions, only further alienated the local populace and strengthened the popular resentment to Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime.

The Duchy of Mirandola c. 1732 History The Pico were a noble family first known for one Hugh, a vassal of Matilda of Tuscany in the 11th century. In the following centuries, members of the family were podest√† in Modena and Reggio Emilia, until, in 1311, Francesco Pico received by emperor Henry VII the fiefs of Quarantoli and San Possidonio in reward of his help during the war against the Este. In 1353 Paolo Pico obtained by the bishops of Reggio the fief of San Martino Spino, and in the following year emperor Charles IV freed the Pico from the dominance of the bishops, placing Mirandola directly under the imperial suzerainty. In 1432 Giovanni Pico received by emperor Sigismund the title of count of Concordia. The city was strongly fortified, and, in the course of the Italian Wars, it was allied with France. It was besieged two times by the Papal troops under Julius II (1511), who personally attacked its walls, and Julius III (1551‚Äì1552). In the second occasion, the fortress resisted successfully under the command of Ludovico Pico and Piero Strozzi. In 1597, after returning under the imperial umbrella, Mirandola obtained the title of city and the Picos were named princes of Mirandola and marquesses of Concordia. In 1617 Alessandro I was finally declared duke. The main economical activities in Renaissance times were animal husbandry, agriculture and, starting from the 17th century, silk clothes. The duchy however suffered from internal crisis and the numerous military operations in the area, such as in 1630 when it was ravaged by the imperial troops. The last lord was Francesco Maria Pico, who was charged with treason after having been forced to cede the fortress to the French. The duchy was acquired by the Duchy of Modena under the House of Este, who bought it for 175,000 golden doppie.

The main battlefield was centered on two cities, Datong and Jining. Prelude After the Chinese Civil War had broken out in full scale on June 22, 1946, the communists had many difficulties. Zhangjiakou, the capital of the communist base in border area of Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei was sandwiched between nationalist strongholds both in the east and the west. The nationalist stronghold Datong in the west was guarded by the nationalist 38th Division, the 5th Cavalry Division, the 6th Cavalry Division and some local security forces totaling 20,000. In an attempt to eliminate the nationalist threat of Zhangjiakou, the communist decided to first take the nationalist stronghold of Datong in the west by concentrating a total of thirty regiments from nine brigades, and out of the nine brigades, five brigades were to be deployed to assault the city itself, while the remaining four brigades were deployed at regions of Zhuozi Mountain (Zhuo Zi Shan, ÂçìËµÑÂ±±), Earth Castle (Tu Cheng Zi, ÂúüÂüéÂ≠ê), Merchant Capital (Shang Du, ÂïÜÈÉΩ) and Cool Castle (Liang Cheng, ÂáâÂüé) near Jining to stop and ambush the nationalist reinforcement. Order of battle Defenders: nationalist order of battle: *The 38th Division *The 5th Cavalry Division *The 6th Cavalry Division *A security regiment *The 35th Army *The Newly Organized 31st Division *The 11th Division *The 17th Division *Two divisions from the 3rd Army *4 cavalry divisions *The 101st Division *Newly Organized 32nd Division *The Newly Organized 4th Cavalry Division Attackers: communist order of battle: *Units from the 2nd Column of the communist Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Military Region *Units from the 3rd Column of the communist Shanxi-Chahar- Hebei Military Region *Units from the 4th Column of the communist Shanxi- Chahar-Hebei Military Region *Independent 1st Brigade of the communist Shanxi- Suiyuan Field Army *Independent 3rd Brigade of the communist Shanxi-Suiyuan Field Army *The 358th Brigade of the communist Shanxi-Suiyuan Field Army *The cavalry Brigade of the communist Shanxi-Suiyuan Field Army *Local militia units The Campaign On July 31, 1946, the communists launched their assaults on the nationalist outposts outside Datong and by August 4, 1946, the defenders were forced to withdrew behind the city wall after suffering more than 2,000 casualties. The enemy begun their assault on the city itself on September 14, 1946 and by September 4, 1946, Northern Pass (Bei Guan, ÂåóÂÖ≥), Train station at the Western Pass (Xi Guang, Ë•øÂÖ≥) in the outskirt of the city had fallen into enemy hands. By this time, the nationalist 35th Army, two divisions of the nationalist 3rd Army, and 4 nationalist cavalry divisions totaling more than thirty thousand attempted to reinforce the besieged Datong by attacking communist held Jining from Hohhot in three fronts. The communists, in turn, decided to deploy three brigades and local militia to continue the siege of Datong while the rest of force totaling more than forty thousands would be deployed to fight the nationalist reinforcement. After taking Zhuozi Mountain (Zhuo Zi Shan, ÂçìËµÑÂ±±) to the west of Jining on September 10, 1946, the nationalist the Newly Organized 31st Division, the 11th Division, and the 17th Division attempted to attack Jining from north and west under the air cover, but they were beaten back by the communists. On September 11, 1946, the communists launched a counteroffensive on the nationalist reinforcement retreating toward Crouching Dragon Mountain (Wo Long Shan, ÂçßÈæôÂ±±) and Head Bad Mountain (Nao Bao Shan, ËÑëÂåÖÂ±±), badly mauling the nationalist 11th Division and the 17th Division, killing more than 5,000 nationalist troops. On September 12, 1946, the nationalist 101st Division followed by the Newly Organized 32nd Division and the Newly Organized 4th Cavalry Division came to take Jining in full force. By September 13, 1946, the nationalist reinforcement reached Jining and begun their attack on the city, and the communists were forced to abandon the city in the evening on the same day. By September 16, 1946, the communists withdrew their siege on Datong and the campaign concluded with nationalists suffering over 12,000 casualties and the communists suffered several thousand casualties. Outcome For the nationalists, the campaign was a failure because although the nationalists were able to beat off enemy attacks on the two cities, majority of rural area in the region had fallen into the enemy hands, and the nationalists defenders of the two cities were isolated, which greatly drained the nationalists resources later as the nationalists attempted to re-supply the isolated cities, resulting in nationalist defense lines overly stretched. Furthermore, the nationalists were infatuated with conquering as much land as possible instead of inflicting heavy casualties on their enemy, resulting in enemy being escaped with relatively few numerical losses in comparison to that of nationalists themselves. One of such nationalist blunders made in the campaign was that in their attack on Jining, the nationalists did not besiege the city and thus the enemy defending the city were able to withdraw. However, such mistake was intentional because the nationalist commander Fu Zuoyi was not willing to sacrifice his own troops for Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan. Similarly, Yan Xishan was not willing to sacrifice his own troops for Chiang and Fu Zuoyi either. As a result of lack of corporation, the enemy was able to successfully withdraw, and eventually returned with vengeance and the lessons learnt in this campaign, and the nationalists would consequently have to pay a heavy price later. However, their enemy had suffered equally if not greater because although the communists had managed in inflicting greater number of casualties on the nationalists, they had failed to achieve their original goal of capturing Datong and Jining. The communist failure was mainly due to the grave underestimation of the enemy strength. Not only the communists had failed to achieve absolute numerical superiority, which by Mao Zedong's definition at the time, should be at least three or four times than the opposing sides, and with absolute technical inferiority as in the case of this campaign, it should even be five or six times. As a result of failing to achieve absolute numerical superiority, the communist troops with absolute technical inferiority lost in this campaign were the cream of the crop: these were the combat hardened veterans with great experiences resulted from years of fighting. Although the communists were able to later boost their strength by drafting local militia into their regular army which swelled to a much larger size than it was before the campaign, there was a fatal flaw of the newly formed communist force: those militia were only good at guerilla tactics and had no knowledge on regular warfare, and as result, both the individual fighting capability and the fighting capability as military formations of these new troops were greatly inferior than that of veterans killed in the campaign. Additionally, many if not most of these new guerrilla fighters were illiterate and could not operate modern weaponry captured from the nationalists, and since most of the combat hardened veterans with experience were killed, there were not enough trainers to train these new troops either. These factors led the communist loss of Zhangjiakou later in the Battle of Zhangjiakou, and the result this campaign is therefore classified as a stalemate at the best if not a communist defeat.

The route overlaps with other A-roads for several sections of its length. It is a faster route from Teignmouth to Salcombe than the A379 which meets it at both ends. It is under the control of Devon County Council as highway authority. Route The A381 starts in Teignmouth from a junction with the A379 at Shaldon Bridge, following the Teign Estuary to Kingsteignton, where it overlaps the A380 to cross the River Teign. At the Penn Inn Roundabout it then continues west on a short dual carriageway into central Newton Abbot and southwest to Totnes. Here it overlaps the A385 to cross the River Dart and the main London-Penzance railway line. From a junction on the west of Totnes it rises southwards into the South Hams. This section of the road is an important link to the national road network for the town of Dartmouth (served by the A3122) as the alternative A379 via Torbay is reliant upon the Dartmouth Higher Ferry with its associated fares and peak- time queues. As the road approaches Kingsbridge it enters the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and skirts around the edge of the town, overlapping for a short distance with the A379 road before finally turning south to Salcombe. An identically-numbered spur from this road turns back eastward to Kingsbridge. History Former alignment of A381 in Totnes before bypass The constant pressure of traffic through the narrow streets of Totnes town centre prompted the construction of the Western Bypass around the edge of the town, together with a second crossing of the River Dart at Brutus Bridge in 1982. The tight-knit nature of the town centre's development, quickly thinning to countryside, meant that relatively few buildings needed demolition to facilitate construction of the new road. In 1991 and 2006 the route through and around Kingsbridge was redrawn twice, when the section northwest of Kingsbridge was downgraded to B-road status leaving a gap in the route, and subsequently diverted to the former route of the B3197 around the west side of the town leaving the original section through West Alvington as a spur of the new road. As a rural main road, the A381 has been the scene of multiple accidents. During 2008-2010 there were three fatal accidents on the section from Totnes to Halwell, prompting Devon County Council to implement a Casualty Severity Reduction Scheme, improving road markings and signage. On Sunday 20 May 2012 a section of the road through Totnes was part of the Olympic Torch procession for the London 2012 Olympics.

The screenplay by Harry Kleiner is based on the lyrics and book by Oscar Hammerstein II, from the 1943 stage musical of the same name, set to the music of Georges Bizet's 1875 opera Carmen. The opera was an adaptation of the 1845 Prosper M√©rim√©e novella Carmen by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal√©vy. Carmen Jones was a CinemaScope and DeLuxe Color motion picture that had begun shooting within the first 12 months of Twentieth Century Fox's venture in 1953 to the widescreen format as its main production mode. Carmen Jones was released in October 1954, exactly one year and one month after Fox's first CinemaScope venture, the Biblical epic The Robe, had opened in theatres. In 1992, Carmen Jones was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot Set during World War II, the story focuses on Carmen Jones, a \\"shameless vixen\\" who works in a parachute factory in North Carolina. When she is arrested for fighting with a co-worker who reported her for arriving late for work, the leader of the Army guards, Sgt. Brown assigns handsome Corporal Joe to deliver her to the civilian authorities over 50 miles away. This is much to the dismay of Joe's fianc√©e Cindy Lou, who had agreed to marry him during his leave prior to his reporting for flight school and an eventual officer's commission. While en route, Joe wishes to deliver his prisoner as soon as possible to return to Cindy Lou and his leave. He decides to save time by taking his jeep over a road warned unsuitable for motor vehicles that is half the distance to the town where he is taking Carmen. Carmen suggests she and Joe stop for a meal and a little romance, and his refusal intensifies her determination to seduce him. Their army jeep ends up hopelessly stuck in a river. Carmen suggests they spend the night at her grandmother's house nearby and continue their journey by train the following day, and that night Joe succumbs to Carmen's advances. The next morning he awakens to find a note in which she says although she loves him, she is unable to deal with time in jail and is running away. Joe is demoted to private and locked in the stockade for allowing his prisoner to escape. Cindy Lou arrives for a visit just as a rose from Carmen is delivered to him, prompting her to leave abruptly. Having found work in a Louisiana nightclub, Carmen awaits his release. One night champion prizefighter Husky Miller enters with an entourage and introduces himself to Carmen, who expresses no interest in him. Husky orders his manager Rum Daniels to offer her jewelry, furs, and an expensive hotel suite if she and her friends Frankie and Myrt accompany him to Chicago, but she declines the offer. Just then, Joe arrives and announces he must report to flying school immediately. Angered, Carmen decides to leave with Sgt. Brown, who also has appeared on the scene, and Joe severely beats him. Realizing he will be sentenced to a long prison term for hitting his superior, Joe flees to Chicago with Carmen. Tired of being cooped up in a shabby rented room, Carmen gets dressed and leaves under the guise of buying groceries. Since he can't leave the room at all lest he be arrested, Joe questions her. Carmen becomes annoyed and tells him that she does what she wants. Carmen goes to Husky Miller's gym to ask Frankie for a loan, but she says although she has clothes, furs and diamonds, she has no actual cash. Frankie tries to convince Carmen to sit in Husky's corner so they all can be well taken care of, but Carmen is in love and refuses to double time Joe. Husky believes she is back to finally be with him, but she refuses his advances before leaving so he tells his entire entourage that they are cut off financially until they produce Carmen (who he nicknames Heatwave). Carmen then pawns a piece of jewelry so she can buy groceries before returning to the room. When she returns not only with a bag of groceries but a new dress and shoes, Joe questions how she paid for them. Offended that he is accusing her of cheating, the two argue and she leaves to Husky's hotel suite dressed in her new clothes to spend time with her friends. Frankie begins to fortune tell with cards and Carmen takes it all lightly until she draws the nine of spades. She interprets it as a premonition of her impending death and chooses to enjoy the rest of her life no matter how long it is. Cindy Lou arrives at Husky's gym in search of Carmen since she is the only one who knows where Joe is. Frankie tells her to give up on Joe because he is nothing but trouble. An angry Joe arrives having evaded capture and intent on getting Carmen back. Although Cindy Lou is present, he ignores her while ordering Carmen to leave with him. Husky intervenes and he is threatened by a concealed knife Joe has brought with him. Husky's people try to get him to stand down due to his fighting prowess, but can't since Joe won't stop. Joe is hit with a few blows before Carmen helps him get away. Joe asks why if she no longer loves him, but she reveals it's because she can't bear to see anyone cooped up. She then tells Cindy Lou to go home and find someone worthy of her. After leaving, Cindy Lou expresses to herself how silly it is trying to save a man who not only doesn't love her but has left her for another woman. Joe escapes the Military Police and attends Husky's big fight. Dressed to the nines, Carmen, her friends and Husky's entourage escort Husky to the ring. He falters in the first round, but comes back to beat his opponent in the second. Husky runs to Carmen's loving arms after winning, but they are parted after he is put up on his entourage's shoulders. Joe grabs Carmen as she is following Husky to his dressing room and pulls her into a storage room, where he begs her to return to him. Angry that she has moved on, he claims he should have killed her. In a matter of fact manner, she tells him that what they had is over and there is no going back for them. When Carmen continues to rebuff him and says he needs to kill her or let her go, Joe strangles her to death. A janitor finds him as he goes to alert the military police. He realizes he is now going to die for committing murder. Production The Broadway production of Carmen Jones by Billy Rose opened on December 2, 1943 and ran for 503 performances.Carmen Jones at the Internet Broadway Database When he saw it, Otto Preminger dismissed it as a series of \\"skits loosely based on the opera\\" with a score \\"simplified and changed so that the performers who had no operatic training could sing it.\\" In adapting it for the screen, he wanted to make \\"a dramatic film with music rather than a conventional film musical,\\"Preminger, Otto, Preminger: An Autobiography. New York: Doubleday 1977. , p. 133 so he decided to return to the original source material‚Äîthe Prosper M√©rim√©e novella‚Äîand hired Harry Kleiner, whom he had taught at Yale University, to expand the story beyond the limitations imposed upon it by the Bizet opera and Hammerstein's interpretation of it.Hirsch, Foster, Otto Preminger: The Man Who Would Be King. New York: Alfred A. Knopf 2007. , p. 211 Preminger realized no major studio would be interested in financing an operatic film with an all-Black cast, so he decided to produce it independently. He anticipated United Artists executives Arthur B. Krim and Robert S. Benjamin, who had supported him in his censorship battles with The Moon Is Blue, would be willing to invest in the project, but the two felt it was not economically viable and declined.Preminger, p. 134 Following the completion of his previous film, River of No Return, Preminger had paid 20th Century Fox $150,000 to cancel the remainder of his contract,Hirsch, p. 207Preminger, p. 132 so he was surprised when Fox head Darryl F. Zanuck contacted him and offered to finance the film while allowing him to operate as a fully independent filmmaker. In December 1953, he accepted $750,000 and began what became a prolonged preproduction period. He hired cinematographer Sam Leavitt as director of photography, Herschel Burke Gilbert as musical director, and Herbert Ross as choreographer and began to scout locations.Hirsch, p. 212 On April 14, 1954, six weeks before principal photography was scheduled to begin, Preminger was contacted by Joseph Breen, who was in the final months of his leadership of the office of the Motion Picture Production Code. Breen had clashed with Preminger over The Moon Is Blue and still resented the director's success in releasing that film without a seal of approval. He cited the \\"over-emphasis on lustfulness\\" in Carmen Jones and was outraged by the screenplay's failure to include \\"any voice of morality properly condemning Carmen's complete lack of morals.\\"Bogle, Donald, Dorothy Dandridge: A Biography. New York: Amistad 1997. , p. 266 Preminger agreed to make some minor adjustments to the script and even filmed two versions of scenes Breen found objectionable, although he included the more controversial ones in the final film.Hirsch, pp. 212-213 Because he himself was sensitive to the issue of racial representation in the film, Preminger had no objections when Zanuck urged him to submit the script to Walter Francis White, executive secretary of the NAACP, who had no objection to it.Bogle, p. 268 Theatrical poster for the film Carmen Jones Preminger began to assemble his cast. Harry Belafonte, a folk singer who recently had introduced Calypso music to a mainstream audience, had only one film to his credit, but he had just won the Tony Award and Theatre World Award for his performance in John Murray Anderson's Almanac, and Preminger cast him as Joe. Pearl Bailey's sole screen credit was the 1948 film Isn't It Romantic?, but she had achieved success as a band singer and was familiar to television audiences from her appearances on Your Show of Shows, so she was assigned the role of Frankie. Joe Adams was a Los Angeles disc jockey with no acting experience, but Preminger felt he had the right look for Husky.Hirsch, p. 213 Diahann Carroll auditioned for the title role, but she was so terrified of the director she could barely focus on the scene,Carroll, Diahann with Firestone, Ross, Diahann: An Autobiography. Boston: Little, Brown 1986. , p. 50 and Preminger cast her in the small supporting role of Myrt instead. Finally, every black actress from Eartha Kitt to Joyce Bryant was tested for the role of Carmen. Preminger was familiar with Dorothy Dandridge but felt she was incapable of exuding the sultry sex appeal the role of Carmen demanded, particularly after having seen Dandridge's performance as a demure schoolteacher opposite Belafonte in Bright Road (1953).Bacon, James. (1958, December 7). \\"Dandridge Belies Sexy Movie Roles\\", Milwaukee Sentinel, page E6 Her agent's office was in the same building where Preminger's brother Ingo worked, and he asked Ingo to intercede on his client's behalf. At his first meeting with Dandridge, Preminger told her she was \\"lovely\\" and looked like a \\"model\\" or \\"a beautiful butterfly,\\" but not Carmen,Dandridge, Dorothy and Conrad, Earl, Everything and Nothing: The Dorothy Dandridge Story. New York: Abelard-Schuman 1970. , p. 156 and suggested she audition for the role of Cindy Lou. Dandridge took the script and left, and when she returned she was dressed and behaved exactly as Preminger envisioned Carmen. The director was impressed enough to schedule a screen test for mid-May, after Dandridge completed a singing engagement in St. Louis. In the interim he cast Juilliard School graduate Olga James as Cindy Lou.Hirsch, pp. 215-218 On May 21, Preminger announced Dandridge had been cast as Carmen. Initially thrilled by the prospect of playing one of the best film roles ever offered an African- American female, Dandridge quickly began to doubt her ability to do it justice. After several days, she told her agent to advise Preminger she was backing out of the project. The director drove to her apartment to reassure her and assuage her fears, and the two unexpectedly began a passionate affair.Hirsch, pp. 218-219Dandridge and Conrad, p. 158 Although Dandridge and Belafonte were known singers, neither sang opera. Marilyn Horne and LeVern Hutcherson were hired to record their vocals, and soundtrack recording began on June 18. Horne later recalled, \\"Even though I was at that time a very light lyric soprano, I did everything I possibly could to imitate the voice of Dorothy Dandridge. I spent many hours with her. In fact, one of the reasons I was chosen to do this dubbing was that I was able to imitate her voice had she been able to sing in the proper register.\\"Carmen Jones at Turner Classic Movies Following three weeks of rehearsal, filming in CinemaScope began on June 30. Preminger had opted to remain in California for the shoot, with El Monte doubling for the Southern exteriors and the Chicago interiors being filmed at the Culver Studios. Principal photography was completed in early August, and Preminger and the Fox publicity studio began promoting both the film and its star. Dandridge was featured in Ebony and photographed for the cover of Life and appeared on a live television broadcast on October 24, four days prior to the opening, to sing two songs from the film.Hirsch, pp. 220-223 The opening title sequence is the first film title sequence created by Saul Bass, and marked the beginning of Bass's long professional relationship with Preminger. Bass also designed the film posters for the movie. The film had its world premiere at the Rivoli Theatre in New York City on October 28, 1954. The following February, it opened in London and Berlin, and in both cities it played for more than a year in exclusive first-run engagements. Because of a technicality in French copyright laws on order of the estate of composer Georges Bizet (who wrote the opera on which the film was based), the film was banned in France until 1981. However, it was permitted to open the 1955 Cannes Film Festival, where for the first time Preminger and Dandridge openly flaunted their relationship. Soon after Cannes, Dandridge was offered the role of Tuptim in the screen adaptation of The King and I, but Preminger, acting as both lover and mentor, urged her not to accept a supporting role after proving her worth as a star. Dandridge complied but later regretted her decision, certain it had been instrumental in starting the slow but steady decline of her career.Hirsch, pp. 230-231Dandridge and Conrad, p. 173 Cast * Dorothy Dandridge as Carmen Jones, who pursues Joe because he alone ignores her; her singing voice is dubbed by Marilyn Horne * Harry Belafonte as Joe, a soldier selected for flight school; his singing voice is dubbed by LeVern Hutcherson * Pearl Bailey as Frankie, one of Carmen's best friends *Olga James as Cindy Lou, a young woman who loves Joe‚Äîand whom Joe loves until he falls in love with Carmen * Joe Adams as Husky Miller, contender for heavyweight boxing champion of the world and pursuer of Carmen; his singing voice is dubbed by Marvin Hayes * Brock Peters as Sergeant Brown, who, in his envy of golden \\"fly boy\\" Joe, tells Cindy Lou that Joe volunteered to take Carmen to jail when in reality he gave him no choice; he also forces him into a fight, leaving him to face a 4-plus-year jail sentence or run * Roy Glenn as Rum Daniels, Husky's manager; his singing voice is dubbed by costar Brock Peters * Diahann Carroll as Myrt, another close friend of Carmen; her singing voice is dubbed by Bernice Peterson Song list *\\"Send Them Along\\" ‚Äì Chorus *\\"Lift 'Em Up an' Put 'Em Down\\" ‚Äì Children's Chorus *\\"Dat Love\\" (\\"Habanera\\") ‚Äì Carmen *\\"You Talk Jus' Like My Maw\\" ‚Äì Joe and Cindy Lou *\\"You Go For Me\\" ‚Äì Carmen (Note: This song is the shortest reprise of \\"That's Love\\" in the soundtrack.) *\\"Carmen Jones is Going to Jail\\" ‚Äì Chorus *\\"There's a Cafe on the Corner (\\"S√©guedille\\") ‚Äì Carmen *\\"Dis Flower (\\"Flower Song\\") ‚Äì Joe *\\"Beat Out Dat Rhythm on a Drum (\\"Gypsy Song\\") ‚Äì Frankie *\\"Stan' Up an' Fight (\\"Toreador Song\\") ‚Äì Husky Miller *\\"Whizzin' Away Along de Track (\\"Quintet\\") ‚Äì Carmen, Frankie, Myrt, Dink, and Rum *\\"There's a Man I'm Crazy For\\" ‚Äì Carmen, Frankie, Mert, Rum, and Dink *\\"Card Song\\" ‚Äì Carmen, Frankie, and Chorus *\\"My Joe (\\"Mica√´la's Prayer\\") ‚Äì Cindy Lou *\\"He Got His Self Another Woman\\" ‚Äì Cindy Lou *\\"Final Duet\\" ‚Äì Carmen and Joe *\\"String Me High on a Tree\\" ‚Äì Joe Note: After the intro of the \\"Gypsy Song\\", there is a drum solo played by a drummer named Max and as the crowd hears it, they yell, \\"Go, Max!\\" The drummer is jazz percussionist Max Roach. Critical reception Bosley Crowther of The New York Times called the film \\"a big musical shenanigan and theatrical tour-de-force\\" and added, \\"In essence, it is a poignant story. It was in the opera of Bizet, and it is in the rich nostalgic folklore of the American Negro in the South. But here it is not so much poignant as it is lurid and lightly farcical, with the African American characters presented by Mr. Preminger as serio-comic devotees of sex ... The incongruity is pointed when these people break into song to the wholly surprising and unnatural aria airs from Bizet's opera. The tempos are alien to their spirits, the melodies are foreign to their moods, but they have at those classical numbers as though they were cutting rugs. And whatever illusions and exaltations the musical eloquence might remotely inspire are doused by the realistic settings in which Mr. Preminger has played his film ... There is nothing wrong with the music‚Äîexcept that it does not fit the people or the words. But that did not seem to make much difference to Mr. Hammerstein or Mr. Preminger. They were carried away by their precocity. The present consequence is a crazy mixed-up film.\\"The New York Times review Variety wrote that Preminger transferred the play from stage to screen \\"with taste and imagination in an opulent production\\" and directed \\"with a deft touch, blending the comedy and tragedy easily and building his scenes to some suspenseful heights. He gets fine performances from the cast toppers, notably Dorothy Dandridge, a sultry Carmen whose performance maintains the right hedonistic note throughout.\\"Variety review In a 2007 review in The Guardian, Andrew Pulver rated it three out of five stars and observed, \\"Underneath its obvious charms‚Äîslinky Dorothy Dandridge, brawny Harry Belafonte and a handful of memorable numbers relocated from Bizet's original‚Äîthe 1954 film version of Oscar Hammerstein's all-black Broadway musical now feels like a relic from the gruesome social straitjacket that was segregation; every frame, you feel, is freighted with the tension imposed by the never-appearing white folks. It was, however, laudable in its desire to showcase the talents of African-American performers who were denied opportunities in Hollywood.\\"The Guardian review TV Guide rated the film three out of four stars, calling it \\"intermittently successful\\" and \\"saved by a terrific cast\\" despite \\"Preminger's heavy-handed\\" direction.TV Guide review The British television network Channel 4, in an evaluation for its viewers, went so far as state it was \\"a truly dreadful film. Preminger can't be faulted for ambition, but for once, his execution is sorely lacking ... Dandridge's tough, hip-swinging, steely eyed Carmen goes some way to redeeming things, but the part is too fractured by the imposition of another singing voice, bad dubbing, and the alien tone of the songs.\\"Channel 4 review\\\\--link needs renewal James Baldwin, in his 1955 published essays Notes of a Native Son, devotes his critical attention to the movie with the essay \\"Carmen Jones: The Dark Is Light Enough\\".. . the essay -- \\"Carmen Jones: The Dark Is Light Enough,\\" James Baldwin.

They are founding and continuing full members of the Scottish Rugby Union and play home games at Kings Park, Dalkeith. The club played in East Regional League Division Two for season 2016-2017. History The club was formed in 1898, with the first match being against Edinburgh Institution 2nd XV (now Stewart's Melville) on 14 October of that year. Dalkeith won 60‚Äì0 with six tries being scored. Although there are no details of the team that played that day, a team photograph from 1899 hangs in the clubhouse, recording the names of those who pioneered the game in the area at that time. The club's first president was J.C. Paterson and the captain was J. Warden, a farmer at Wester Cowden. During the first year, the club also played against Morningside, Brunstone, Heriots 2nd XV and Watsonians 3rd XV. Clubs played in 1899 included Heriots, Royal High School, Edinburgh University, Peebles and Corstorphine, with J. Duncan captaining the side that season. The first annual supper was held in the Cross Keys Hotel on 9 March 1990 where a presentation of a pipe was made to the club referee, George Goldie of Eskdale Lodge. The club ceased playing in 1915, due to the First World War; the captain that year was R.Stewart and the president was Sir Henry Dundas. The club did not reform until February 1934 when a meeting of interested players met at the Scientific Hall and elected president George Dick. Club colours of red, white and green were adopted and the first match against local rivals Lasswade was played on 29 September at Kirkbank. The club played a further three seasons until amalgamations were first mooted, Musselburgh RFC called a meeting to discuss with the other clubs in Midlothian the possibility of amalgamating under the Musselburgh name. As this was found to be unacceptable to most of those present the proposal did no proceed, however at a meeting held in October the members of Dalkeith and Lasswade decided to join forces and due to their greater number of members it was decided to play under the Lasswade name. The Second World then intervened and this had a direct result on the reformation of Dalkeith RFC as a separate entity. In March 1946, the club was reformed under George Dick as President and Captain Jim Penman. The first match was played on 19 September against Rosyth. Mr S.B. Syme from Newtongrange gifted a set of navy blue jerseys to the club. At a meeting in the band hall in Newtongrange the former colours of red, white and green were reaffirmed as the club colours. From 1946 to 1956 matches were still played at Kirkbank with a byre used as a changing room and a cold water tap and two tubs as washing facilities. During this time, accountant Pat Shaw became president. The lease of an old guardhouse at the King's Line Barracks, Newbattle, was negotiated, which was converted into clubrooms. Notable players during this year were Adam Robson (1949) who went on to play for Hawick and gain 22 caps for Scotland before coming president of the Scottish Rugby Union and Brian Henderson who played for Edinburgh Wanderers and gained 12 Scottish Caps. The Diamond jubilee of the club was celebrated on 27 March 1958 in the Unicorn Inn. In the spring of 1959 the club moved to King's Park with the tennis pavilion being used as the changing rooms. A celebration match was played in April 1959. 1963 saw the inception of the Dalkeith Shield, a 15-a-side knockout tournament for clubs in the Lothians. The tournament runs to this day and is the longest running 15-a-side tournament in Scotland. Clubs who completed in the early years of competition include Haddington, Currie and Preston Lodge. By the late 1960s the club planned to improving the dilapidated clubhouse and changing facilities. Bill Dunnett, who was president from 1966 to 69, was instrumental in the development of the new clubhouse, opened on 6 September 1972. A match to herald the opening was held between Dalkeith and a Scottish International Side which included Sandy Carmichael, Ian McLauchlan, Jim Telfer, Jim Renwick, Andy Irvine, Dougie Morgan, Arthur Brown, Colin Telfer, Nairn McEwan and former Dalkeith member Jock Bertinussin. Notable Dalkeith players of the era were Bill Ingram who played for Melrose and the South District team, and Tom Jack who played for Gala. Businessman David Murray played for the club until he lost both legs in a car accident when driving home from a match. During the 1970s National Leagues were introduced and Dalkeith entered the 7th Division in season 1976‚Äì77. The clubs were runners-up in that year and gained promotion to Division 6 alongside Stirling County. The following year the club became champions, having beaten Stirling in front of one of the largest crowds ever seen in King's Park. Subsequent progress was only made to Division 5, and since then, the lower reaches of Division 6 & 7\\\\. Dalkeith did finally manage to win their own Shield tournament in 1976, and again in 2001 and 2004.

It was first aired on May 9, 2007, on ABC. The episode was directed by Bobby Roth and written by Elizabeth Sarnoff and Drew Goddard.Audio commentary for \\"The Man Behind the Curtain\\", Season 3 DVD set of Lost Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) reluctantly leads John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) to Jacob, the mysterious leader of the Others. The episode is the first to feature flashbacks recounting Ben's backstory. Plot =Flashbacks= Emily Linus (Carrie Preston), gives birth to her son in a forest. Afterwards, her husband Roger (Jon Gries), carries her and the baby to the roadside outside Portland, where a car carrying Horace Goodspeed (Doug Hutchison) and Olivia (Samantha Mathis) soon stops to help them. Emily dies after telling Roger to name the baby Benjamin. Seven years later, Ben (Sterling Beaumon) and his father arrive at the Island to work for the DHARMA Initiative, of which Horace is a member. At one point, Ben sees another vision of his dead mother. This, along with his drunken father blaming him for his mother's death, prompts Ben to sneak into the jungle in search of her. He encounters Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), one of the \\"Hostiles\\" who are native to the island. Ben tells Richard that he wants to join the Hostiles on the grounds of not liking the DHARMA Initiative. Richard tells Ben that if he truly wants this, then he must be very, very patient. Years later, Ben, now a young man working for DHARMA, helps his father Roger load a van. (This is the same van that Hurley had found in \\"Tricia Tanaka is Dead\\"). After confronting his father about forgetting his birthday again, Roger suggests they go for a drive together after their work is done, to have some father-son time. After parking atop a hill, Ben asks his father if he blames him for the death of his mother. Roger simply answers \\"What do I know\\", and promises to try and remember Ben's birthday the following year. But Ben, fed up after years of neglect and abuse, pulls out a gas mask and bids his father goodbye before filling the van with a gas that kills Roger. Ben returns to the barracks, where all the DHARMA workers have died from the same gas, and Alpert and his men emerge wearing masks. As Alpert's men start picking up the bodies, Alpert offers to go and collect Roger's, but Ben tells him to \\"leave him out there\\". =Locke and the Others= John Locke arrives at the Others' camp carrying his father's body on his back, and demands that Ben tell him everything about the Island. Ben tells him that the true leader of the Others is named Jacob, and denies Locke's request to see him. Ben also tells John that he was not born on the island. (Actually born \\"outside Portland\\") as we see at the beginning of this episode. Soon after, Mikhail Bakunin (Andrew Divoff) stumbles into the camp and talks about a parachutist who landed on the Island, Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason). To convince Ben to bring him before Jacob, Locke beats Mikhail unconscious, while Tom and Richard do not intervene. Ben and Locke arrive at Jacob's cabin. They enter, but Locke cannot see anyone inside. Ben introduces Locke to Jacob and gestures towards an empty chair, to which he starts talking. Locke tells Ben that he is crazy and pathetic. Just as Locke is about to exit the house, an odd and deep voice says \\"Help me\\". Locke pulls out a flashlight, and suddenly, objects in the room begin to violently fly about, windows shatter, and Ben is flung against a wall as a strange man is briefly seen sitting in the chair. Locke and Ben run out of the house. The following day, Locke still does not believe Jacob is real, and says he will expose Ben as a fraud. Locke notices that Ben is leading them back by a different path, and Ben then leads him to mass grave full of skeletons clothed in DHARMA uniforms. Ben tells Locke that he helped kill his own people when it became clear that the DHARMA workers could not coexist with the natives, and then shoots Locke, who falls into the pit. Locke reveals Jacob said \\"Help me\\", and Ben replies that he certainly hopes Jacob helps him, as he departs leaving Locke for dead. =At the Beach= At the survivors' camp, James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway) plays Juliet Burke's (Elizabeth Mitchell) tape for Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly). Later that night, the survivors are introduced to Naomi and the tape is played for all to hear. Just then, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Juliet return to the camp. Juliet tells Sawyer to play the other side of the tape, which is Ben's plan to lead a team to kidnap all the fertile women. Juliet reveals that she has already told Jack about it, and that they were still thinking of a plan. Production The episode's title references The Wizard of Oz, as the question of how powerful Ben and the Others as a whole are is compared to \\"the ferocious and majestical Wizard of Oz, and there was in fact this very small man behind the curtain.\\" Jacob, the mysterious entity who rules the Others, made its first physical appearance. For the scene in the cabin, actor Michael Emerson wrote Jacob's unspoken lines so that it would seem more like a normal conversation was transpiring between the two. Damon Lindelof describes Richard Alpert's encounter with the young Ben, and Ben and Locke's approach to the cabin as analogous to that of the choosing of the Dalai Lama by the Panchen Lama: \\"Richard Alpert might be construed as some sort of a Panchen Lama, as he has a conversation with this boy who sees something that he wasn't supposed to see, and now I think Ben finds himself in the role of Panchen Lama as he brings Locke into this cabin, in an attempt to sort of determine whether the island has chosen him to be its new surrogate. The opening scene, in which we see Ben's mother giving birth to him in a forest, was meant to trick the audience into thinking that the scene took place on the Island - much as the openings of \\"Man of Science, Man of Faith\\" and \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" were intended to do the opposite. The part of Emily Linus, Ben's mother, was played by actress Carrie Preston, the real- life wife of Michael Emerson. They had also worked together in other works, such as the 2004 film Straight-Jacket. Preston was cast as Ben's mother following Emerson telling people at parties that she was desperate for a part on the show.Denise Martin (September 15, 2008). \\"'Lost' star Michael Emerson: What you didn't know\\". The Los Angeles Times. Retrieved on September 30, 2008. Director Bobby Roth said the 1970s scenes try to convey the decade's \\"full of hope\\" spirit, where \\"people try to create a new world\\". The interior design for the DHARMA installations tried to be utopic, but utilitarian. Awards Michael Emerson submitted this episode for consideration for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards, an award he would go on to be nominated for. He lost to fellow cast member Terry O'Quinn for his own submitted episode \\"The Man from Tallahassee\\".

The label also scored many hits on the Billboard Hot 100 pop music chart during this time.  Life and career  Raised on a farm in Middleton, Tennessee, Stewart moved to Memphis in 1948 after graduating from high school. He worked at Sears and the First National Bank and then was drafted into the United States Army. After serving for two years, Stewart returned to his job as a bank clerk in Memphis in 1953.Cogan, Jim; Clark, William, Temples of sound : inside the great recording studios, San Francisco : Chronicle Books, 2003. . Cf. pp. 65‚Äì66. Stewart was a part-time fiddle player and joined a local country music group, the Canyon Cowboys. He worked days as a banker at Union Planters Bank. In 1957, Stewart launched his own record label, then called Satellite Records, which issued country music and rockabilly records. His sister, Estelle Axton, mortgaged her home to invest in her brother's venture by buying an Ampex 300 tape recorder. In 1959, the label moved into the former Capitol Theatre in Memphis. (The label's name 'STAX' is a combination of STewart and AXton) The auditorium was converted to studio space, and the stage was made into the a control room. To save money, Stewart did not level the floor. This created unique acoustics, which are noticeable in the recordings made there, with many featuring a heavy, bassy sound. After selling millions of records during its history, Stax went bankrupt in 1976. Stewart kept a low profile and intensely protected his privacy. When he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002, he sent his granddaughter Jennifer to the induction ceremony to accept the award on his behalf.

The proclamation was printed in the Polish and Lithuanian languages after Polish forces captured Vilnius in the Vilna offensive during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. It was a statement of Pi≈Çsudski's political intentions, and contained a blueprint for his Miƒôdzymorze federation. The declaration was sharply criticized by both Polish and Lithuanian nationalists. In issuing the proclamation bilingually, Pi≈Çsudski was appealing to the Lithuanians, hoping to recreate the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. The style of the proclamation, the ideas contained within it, and the dramatic turn of phrase were definitely Pi≈Çsudski's, and reflected his position on the political and military situation he wished to resolve. Pi≈Çsudski pledged to ordain \\"elections which would take place on the basis of secret, universal and direct voting, without distinction between the sexes\\" and to \\"create an opportunity for settling your nationality problems and religious affairs in a manner that you yourself will determine, without any kind of force or pressure from Poland.\\" Pi≈Çdudski's proclamation was aimed at showing good will both to Lithuanians and international diplomats. It succeeded with the latter, as the proclamation dealt a blow to the image of 'Polish conquest' and replaced it with the image of 'Poland fighting with Bolshevik dictatorship and liberating other nations'. However, the Lithuanians who demanded exclusive control over the city saw the proclamation as a facade for Polish imperialism. Pi≈Çsudski's words also caused much controversy on the Polish political scene as they were not debated in the Sejm. This caused much anger among Pi≈Çsudski's opponents from the National Democracy faction. Deputies from Polish People's Party demanded incorporation of the Vilnius Region into Poland, and even accused Pi≈Çsudski of treason. However Pi≈Çsudski's supporters in the Polish Socialist Party managed to deflect those attacks.

In early 1996 the two cities were successful in obtaining an $850,000 grant of Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) for the Greenway.Maryville Alcoa Daily Times Nov 30, 1998; Trail of Two Cities is a landmark of long term effort, cooperation Between 1996 and 1998 the two parks were connected by a three-mile (5 km) extension entirely within the city of Alcoa. During the same period Maryville extended the Greenway from the Greenbelt to the Maryville Intermediate School. On October 15, 1998 the Maryville Alcoa Greenway was dedicated. The Greenway was immediately well received by the public and by early 1999 plans were already underway for extensions.Maryville Alcoa Daily Times Feb 25, 1999; Enjoying a trek along the Greenway The result was Alcoa extended a spur through the Springbrook Corporate Center. The two cities also completed an eastern connector between the Greenbelt and Springbrook Park. Today the Greenway is well lighted and marked, providing numerous opportunities for picnics, play, and exercise while connecting the two cities and providing a nine-mile linear recreational facility. Alcoa Main (4 miles) Beginning at Mile Marker 0 (the line between Maryville and Alcoa), the Greenway proceeds north for to the Springbrook Corporate Center Spur, then east to the Alcoa Duck Pond at mile 3, then north through Springbrook Park to Hunt Road, ending at mile 4.

UCLA English Department He specializes in nineteenth-century British literature.  Biography  Grossman was born in Oxford, England, in 1967 to Marc and Penelope Grossman. He attended Milton Academy in Milton, Massachusetts. He received his Bachelor of Arts in English and religion from Brown University in 1989, and his PhD in English from the University of Pennsylvania in 1996.  Scholarship  Grossman's first book, The Art of Alibi: English Law Courts and the Novel, was published by The Johns Hopkins University Press in 2002. The book examines early nineteenth-century crime fiction's relation to the law courts prior to detective fiction's invention in the 1840s. It falls into the interdisciplinary field of law and literature as well as early Victorian studies. Charles Dickens's Networks: Public transport and the Novel (Oxford), his second book, examines the history of public transport's systematic networking of people and how this revolutionized perceptions of time, space, and community, and how the art form of the novel played a special role in synthesizing and understanding that revolution. Focusing on a trio of road novels by Charles Dickens, this study looks first at a key historical moment in the networked community's coming together, then at a subsequent recognition of its tragic limits, and, finally, at the construction of a revised view that expressed the precarious, limited omniscient perspective by which passengers came to imagine their journeying in the network. Since 2011, Grossman has been co-editor of the journal Nineteenth-Century Literature. Grossman's academic interests include the history, form, and sociology of the novel, and narrative and temporality.

It is located in Selston, Nottinghamshire, England. The headteacher is Mr Paul Halcro.Featured on the college's website homepage at www.selstonhighschool.notts.sch.uk.  History  The school was previously called Matthew Holland School, named after the chairman of the local education committee at the time of its construction, who lived locally. The name change was the subject of much debate as it had been known as Matthew Holland for more than half a century. The building was constructed in the late 1930s, and during the war was on standby for use as a hospital until being established as an educational institution in late 1945 or early 1946. After a long campaign, the school obmmunity College, and subsequently received specialist funding. This funding has not only supported the arts departments within the college, but has been a catalyst for many improvements benefiting the whole student community. In September 2012 the school opened with a new brand, uniform and a name that signalled the start of a new year set to be full of changes under the leadership of the new headteacher, Mr Kevin Gaiderman. The school was renamed to Selston High School. Previously a community school administered by Nottingham Government, Seigh School was converted to academy status in April 2016. The school is now part of the Two Counties Trust which includes Ashfield School and Swanwick Hall School. However Selston High School continues to coordinate with Nottinghamshire County Council for admissions. In September 2015 Mr John Maher formerly Deputy Headteacher at Ashfield School became headteacher at Selston following the departure of Mr Kevin Gaiderman.  Demographics  The College is a mixed school with around 700 pupils. The Primary schools which feed Selston High are Holly Hill Primary School, Jacksdale Primary School, Bagthorpe Primary School, Underwood CofE Primary School, and Brinsley Primary School. Over 90% of students directly transfer from these schools to the school.  Academic performance  Having previously been deemed 'Satisfactory' Selston High School was found to be 'Good' in all areas by Ofsted in its February 2014 inspection sam In 2016 the school was the only local state school to be awarded 4 star status on the basis of its official performance data by an independent website SchoolGuide.co.uk In its 2015 GCSE Maths results 69% of students made 3+ levels of progress with 41% making above expected progress. These results have risen from 2014 and are well above the national average. In its 2015 GCSE English results 69% of students made 3+ levels of progress with 433% making above expected progress. These results have risen from 2014 and are in line with the national average. In 2015 67% of students achieved 5 or more GCSEs at grade C or higher. This score is above the 2015 national average and has risen from last year's figure. In 2015 13% of students achieved 5 or more GCSEs at grade A or A*. In 2015 the school Best 8 Value Added Score was 1001.1 this is above the national average figure of 1000 indicating students make above average progress during their time at the school  Premises  This school is a smaller than average secondary school but students have access to a full range of facilities. It has a Main Hall with a stage, tiered seating and sound desk, tennis and netball courts, a large playing field with running track and lots more. Students even have the use of Selston Leisure Centre and the public library, next door. In the past, the state of the school was always upon the agenda of school council meetings since it had long been criticised by the students for the building's aged looks. However, the school made an effort to change the working environment for the students; they installed new carpets, new desks, renewed the furnishings in all the science rooms, turned Room One into a conference centre and created a high tech. visitors reception area. Some students at the school complained that the classrooms, in particular the ones along the south-east fa√ßade, got unbearably hot in summer because the old wooden windows along these corridors, if opened, could have potentially put students and staff at risk. However, the windows were subsequently replaced.

It was released on April 1, 1975 by Avco Embassy Pictures. The film was produced by the New York Institute of Technology, under the supervision of its founder, Alexander Schure, who was the project's director.Beck, Jerry (2005), pp. 295‚Äì6. Nearly three decades before the release of this full-length adaptation, stop-motion innovator George Pal made a 1947 Puppetoon which was also based on Tripp and Kleisinger's work. The Paramount short was nominated for a Best Animated Short Oscar, but lost to Warner Bros. Cartoons' Merrie Melodies cartoon, Tweetie Pie. Premise A young tuba named Tubby sets off on a quest to find a song of his own. He visits a circus and ventures into the forest while on the way to Singing City. Voice cast *Paul Tripp as Narrator *Dick Van Dyke as Tubby the Tuba *David Wayne as Pee-Wee the Piccolo *Pearl Bailey as Mrs. Elephant *Jack Gilford as The Herald *Ray Middleton as The Great Pepperino *Jane Powell as Celeste *Cyril Ritchard as The Frog *Ruth Enders as The Haughty Violin *Hermione Gingold as Ms. Squeek Production Tubby the Tuba had his start as the main character in a 1945 children's story for orchestra and narrator, by Paul Tripp and George Kleinsinger, originally performed by Tripp himself, and recorded most famously by Danny Kaye, though many other actor-narrators have performed the piece on record as well, including David Wayne (who also provided a voice for the '71 feature film). The success of the Decca Records track encouraged George Pal, the Puppetoon artist, to make a 1947 short based on it. It would later receive an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Short. A full-length version of Tubby the Tuba was announced in 1974 by Alexander Schure, the millionaire founder of the New York Institute of Technology. He set up the production at its Westbury, New York facilities, in the Animation Department, Visual Arts Center and Tech Sound Lab of that campus. In order for it to compete with the works of children's film leader Disney, he rounded up a celebrity cast (led by Dick Van Dyke and Pearl Bailey), as well as Tripp, the librettist, and a man known as \\"the dean of Broadway musical directors,\\" Lehman Engel. Schure, however, did not know anything about the animation process at the time he started working on it. Because of this, he hired the industry's best artists from the Eastern Seaboard, among whom were Sam Singer from Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse, and John Gentilella from the classic Popeye series. Schure found the progress on the new Tubby was very slow, hindered by the tedious frame-by-frame process occasionally encountered in the hand-drawn art. In response, he turned to an interest in the then-young field of computer graphics, and recruited several consultants and scientists from NYIT so that the project could go on. Two of the later crew members were Edwin Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith, the future founders of Pixar Studios. Thus, it should have marked the first time that computers were ever used in the making of an animated feature, but it ended up being done the conventional way after all. When the film wrapped up production, the first test screenings did not do as well as the crew had hoped it would. As a result, Catmull removed Sam Singer's name from the final prints, taking a credit in Singer's place. He later went on to say about the initial reaction to Tubby: Of director Schure, Catmull's partner Smith observed: \\"We realized [‚Ä¶] that he really didn't have what it takes to make a movie.\\" Neither of the duo were satisfied with what the finished film had to offer. Release In 1974, some time after the end of its production, independent distributor Avco Embassy acquired the rights to release Tubby worldwide. The film came out in select U.S. markets during the following Easter holiday. The feature-length Tubby has been generally forgotten in the annals of animation history since its original run, but on September 11, 2006, a small label called Pegasus brought out a Region 2 DVD in the United Kingdom. To date, it has only received minor VHS releases in North America, including: *Children's Video Library (1983) *Vestron Video (1985) *Family Home Entertainment (Early 1990s) *Sony Wonder (1995) See also *Timeline of CGI in film and television *List of animated feature-length films References : IMDb incorrectly lists the release year as 1976; Allmovie, 1977.

Along with Steven Pinker and others, Gat argues that war is in decline in today's world. He is currently Ezer Weizman Professor of National Security and in his second term (first from 1999‚Äì2003) as Chair of the Department of Political Science at Tel Aviv University. He is the founder and head of the University's Executive Masters Program in Diplomacy and Security. Gat is also a Major in the Israeli Army.(August 2013) Azar Gat Gat holds a doctoral degree from the University of Oxford (1984‚Äì86), an MA from Tel Aviv University (1979‚Äì83), and a BA from the University of Haifa (1975‚Äì78). He has been Alexander von Humboldt Fellow at the University of Freiburg, Germany; Fulbright Fellow at Yale University, USA; British Council Scholar at the University of Oxford, Great Britain; Visiting Fellow at the Mershon Center, Ohio State University, USA; Goldman Visiting Israeli Professor at Georgetown University, USA; and Koret Distinguished Visiting Fellow for Israel Studies at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, USA. Gat's War in Human Civilization, published in 2006 by the Oxford University Press, was named one of the best books of the year by The Times Literary Supplement. Research Azar Gat started his career focusing on military history and strategy, exemplified in his 1989 book The Origins of Military Thought from the Enlightenment to Clausewitz, a book frequently cited especially in relation to Carl von Clausewitz. Over the years he has broadened his scope to include causes, especially the prehistoric causes of war. > In conclusion, let us understand more closely the evolutionary calculus that > can make the highly dangerous activity of fighting over resources > worthwhile. In our societies of plenty, it might be difficult to comprehend > how precarious people's subsistence in pre-modern societies was (and still > is). The spectre of hunger and starvation always loomed over their heads. > Affecting both mortality and reproduction (the latter through human sexual > appetite and women's fertility), it constantly, in varying degrees, trimmed > down their numbers, acting in combination with disease. Thus, struggle over > resources was very often evolutionarily cost-effective. In War in Human Civilization (2006) and following up in Victorious and Vulnerable: Why Democracy won in the 20th Century and How it is Still Imperiled, Gat argues that the world has been becoming steadily more peaceful for thousands of years. He finds that there are two major steps to this process. The first came with the emergence of the state: When populations entered into a social contract with the state, they gave up parts of their autonomy in return for the state taking care of their security. The second step came with modernization and the industrial revolution, which led to economic growth and interdependence and a corresponding increase in affluence and standard of living. It also brought with it liberal democracies and nuclear deterrence. Both these steps and all of these factors led to a reduction in wars and war casualties. In other words, peace has become profitable and therefore more common. At the same time, there are still countries less affected by this development, and war is more frequent in these parts of the world. In claiming that war is in decline, Gat aligns with Steven Pinker, Joshua Goldstein, and Robert Muchembled, who all argue the same although they identify different causal mechanisms behind the phenomena. Gat's broad views on war and its links to culture and human nature are similar to those of Steven A. LeBlanc and Steven Pinker. He incorporates viewpoints from ethology, evolution, evolutionary psychology, anthropology, archaeology, history, historical sociology, and political science. See especially his seminal 2006 book War in Human Civilization. Another example is the paper \\"The Human Motivational Complex: Evolutionary Theory And The Causes Of Hunter- Gatherer Fighting.\\", blockquoted above and cited in \\"Evolutionary Psychology, Memes and the Origin of War\\". Gat believes in the antiquity of the nations. In his view, ancient Egypt, Israel and classical Athens were national states.Umut Ozkirimli, Theories of Nationalism: A Critical Introduction, Macmillan Education UK, 2017, pp. 71, 72 Makes references to A.

Throughout different points in the story, the adult Jehan of some realities struggles to reconcile her religious upbringing and \\"visions\\" with her scientific profession; in the end, however, an aged Jehan finds satisfaction in the explanation of Hugh Everett's theory regarding the possibility of alternate realities, which fits with her personal experiences.

He was born in Pretoria into a significant diamond-mining family (his grandfather, Sir Thomas Cullinan, a diamond mine owner, gave his name to the Cullinan Diamond) and Patrick attended Charterhouse School and Magdalen College, Oxford University in England (where he read Italian and Russian). After his studies, he returned to South Africa, where he worked as a sawmill owner and farmer in the Eastern Transvaal. With Lionel Abrahams, he founded the Bateleur Press in 1974, and the literary journal The Bloody Horse: Writings and the Arts in 1980. Through the journal (the title taken from a poem by Roy Campbell) Cullinan sought to re-establish the standing of poetry in South Africa. Influences included John Betjeman, W. B. Yeats, Eugenio Montale, Rimbaud, and Dante Collections Cullinan's poetry collections include The Horizon Forty Miles Away (1973), Today Is Not Different (1978), The White Hail in the Orchard (1984) and Selected Poems 1961 - 1991 (1992). The volume The White Hail in the Orchard contains what Cullinan called 'versions' by which he meant loose translations from the Italian poetry of Eugenio Montale. Cullinan's poetry, often (in his earlier works) permeated by the Transvaal landscape, is most often concerned with the personal rather than the political; with emotional and metaphysical themes, such as his poem \\"My Predawn Owl\\". Exemplified by this poem, his work is carefully crafted, often lyrical, and at one with the tradition of W. B. Yeats. His work draws from the cultural tradition inspired by major figures such as Dante and Eugenio Montale. While he was inspired and informed by such European tradition, Cullinan firmly identified himself as an African writer: > I spent seven years, from the age of 14 to 21 in Europe (mainly, because I > had no choice, in England), so I certainly ingested a great deal of > European-ness. Therefore, when I came back to South Africa at the age of 21, > I had a problem. Was I in fact a European, or an African? I remember sitting > in a cottage in the Eastern Transvaal, on the Escarpment, thinking it > through one night. When I woke up in the morning, I didn't have to think of > it any longer: I was an African, and I always would be.\\" In addition to volumes of his poetry, Cullinan also published a biography of Robert Jacob Gordon (a Dutch traveller and soldier): Robert Jacob Gordon 1743 - 1795: The Man and His Travels at the Cape (1992), a semi-autobiographical work of prose fiction: Matrix (2002), and most recently, a collection of the letters of Bessie Head: The Imaginative Trespasser (2005). Just before his death, Cullinan published a significant new collection of his works spanning over thirty years, _Escarpments_. Apartheid Cullinan accepted the fact that writers ought to have been involved in the fight against apartheid in South Africa, while acknowledging the fact that is it difficult to produce a satisfactory political poem. Criticism has been levelled at Cullinan - that his work, throughout the Apartheid years in South Africa, did not engage with \\"the struggle\\" against apartheid. In the first edition of The Bloody Horse, Cullinan wrote: > To talk of 'literature', of good writing, of art may be obscene or almost > obscene in a society as self-destructing, engrossed in conflict as this one > is. But the important word is almost. For however cluttered by violence and > potential annihilation a society may find itself, it is the writers and the > artists who portray the reality of this process... There are multiple ways > of telling the truth.\\" This may be as good an encapsulation as any of the position of Cullinan's poetry in its political context. Cullinan believed that it was \\"the fanatical belief that politics is more important than art\\" which was slowing the process of South African poetry becoming \\"more sophisticated\\" and \\"less provincial\\": a limitation which he hoped the \\"New South Africa\\" after the first democratic elections in 1994 would remove.\\"A Modern Sense of Disquiet\\": Patrick Cullinan interviewed by Michael King and Stephen Watson in New Contrast Literary Journal, December 1992. Honors Cullinan won significant recognition in South Africa, and enjoys a reputation as arguably the most prominent South African poet alive at the end of the 20th century. Among the prizes he won are the Slug Award, the Olive Schreiner Prize, three Pringle Awards, the Sanlam Literary Award and the Merit Award (Cape Town Historical Society). In April 2003, the Republic of Italy conferred the title of ‚ÄòCavaliere‚Äô on him for his translations of Italian poetry, in particular the work of Eugenio Montale. Fellow poets Cullinan maintained close contact with other poets writing in South Africa, notably Gus Ferguson. Before their deaths, he was a friend and fellow writer to Lionel Abrahams, Guy Butler, Douglas Livingstone and Stephen Watson. Cullinan made a significant contribution to South African poetry through his encouragement of young writers, both through his teaching, and through his willingness to mentor, support and constructively criticise. During his time at Oxford, he was similarly mentored by John Betjeman (who became a significant correspondent,) - and so represented a unique link between a lyrical English verse tradition and following generations of English-speaking South African poets. Prior to his retirement and his devotion to full-time writing, he lectured for many years at the University of the Western Cape. In retirement, he lived in Cape Town, South Africa.

Born in Birmingham in 1968, Brown played for several clubs, including Shrewsbury Town, Bolton Wanderers and Preston North End. Career  Brown was probably most well known for playing for Shrewsbury Town during the late 80's and 90's, in which during this period he joined the club three times. His most famous moment at the club is most likely scoring the goal which kept Shrewsbury in the Football League in May 2000. He is also the record league appearance holder at Shrewsbury, with 418 appearances spread out over his three periods as a Town player. He first joined the club as an apprentice before breaking into the first team a year later. He then made 174 league starts before joining Bolton Wanderers in 1991. He then returned to Shrewsbury a year after in 1992, playing until 1994, and then leaving for Preston North End. He then returned yet again in 1996, and this time spent 5 years at Shrewsbury until 2001, during which time he made himself a fans favourite after scoring the crucial goal in Shrewsbury's bid to stay in the Football League during 1999‚Äì2000 season. It was after he left Shrewsbury for the final time that his career took him to many other lower division clubs, the likes of Rochdale, Boston United (where he won a Football Conference winners medal in 2002), Nuneaton Borough and Chester City (the club who had been relegated thanks to his Shrewsbury heroics in 2000) signed him, but he only stayed at each club for a short period. In September 2007 Mickey Brown joined West Midlands (Regional) League Premier Division side Shawbury United from Newtown. He has since left the club. In June 2009 he joined Shrewsbury Town F.C as part-time fitness coach. Mickey has been \\"knighted\\" by many fans for his endeavours on the pitch in particular his performance against Exeter City in the last match of the 1999‚Äì2000 season. Many fans refer to him as \\"Sir\\" Mickey Brown for this alone. The fans often sing \\"Mickey Brown sent Chester Down\\" to the tune of Go West as tribute to the club's Great Escape.

Paul, their original intention being to supply films for viewing in the Edison kinetoscope. Projected, the film premiered on 14 January 1896 when Acres showed it to the Royal Photographic Society in Hanover Street, London, using his \\"Kinetic Lantern\\", along with various other films made during the period Acres was working with Paul. Acres had screened some of these films (but not this film) to the Lyonsdown Photographic Society a few days before, on 10 January 1896, just two weeks after the first public screening by the Lumi√®re Brothers in Paris. Following its successful screening in London the film was taken to the United States where it was shown on 23 April 1896 at Koster and Bial's Music Hall in New York City with a series of American movies made by the Edison's company. Despite its simple nature, Rough Sea at Dover became one of the most popular and widely screened early British films. Content The film consists of two distinct shots of different locations which have been edited together. It is not possible to tell with certainty whether these were edited together in the original release version. The first shot is of the rough sea as heavy waves crash against Admiralty Pier in Dover. The second shot is from a different location along a riverbank showing a view of fast- flowing water. It has been speculated that this second half of the footage has been taken from Niagara Falls No. 1: The Upper River Just Above The Falls a film made by Acres late in 1895. Current status Given its age, this short film is available to view or download. It has also featured in a number of film collections such as Primitives and Pioneers.

Because it had the clearest signal of any station on the base, and because it sounded as professional as a large-market station, WFBS became a major success.Michael Futch, \\"Spring Lake Station Dead for a While,\\" The Fayetteville Observer, November 29, 1998 From 1963 to the mid-1970s, the station was owned by Radio Smiles, a group owner of several AM radio stations in North Carolina, including stations in Kinston (WISP), Graham WSML, Raleigh (WRNC) and others.http://boards.radio-info.com/smf/index.php?topic=82137.0 2010 March 24 The station‚Äôs original studios and offices were located on the second floor of the Professional Building in downtown Spring Lake. The tower/transmitter site was a former cow pasture on NC Highway 210, one mile north of Spring Lake.Personal knowledge of this editor. .Discussions with station manager Jerry England, 1978. Between 1966 and 1969, a fire originating in a dentist‚Äôs office in the Professional Building destroyed the station‚Äôs studios and offices. The station built the new WFBS Broadcast House studio and office building at the transmitter site and moved into it prior to 1969.Discussions with station manager Jerry Oakley, 1966‚Äì1969. On February 8, 1969, a fire started underneath the control room of the Broadcast House studio building. The fire spread very quickly, fueled by the plastic insulation of cables installed on the underside of the floor, as well as gasoline and a gasoline powered lawnmower stored nearby. The burning plastic rapidly filled the building with dense smoke. Station personnel tried to save what they could, but the toxic smoke forced them to leave the building with almost nothing. The fire spread from the basement through the studios to the attic. It heavily damaging the back half of the building, collapsed parts of the floor and ceiling, and destroyed the control room, news studio, racks of equipment, and both production rooms. The offices were undamaged by fire, but received substantial smoke damage. The station resumed broadcasting from a temporary studio in the transmitter building. The station offices were moved to a residential style mobile home temporarily located near the studio building while the building was repaired. Conditions were cramped. The bathtub of the mobile home was used as a makeshift filing cabinet. In the mid-1970s the station was purchased by Jerry Oakley, its long-time general manager. In 1979, the station was sold to William Britt,FCC application list at http://svartifoss2.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_list.pl?Facility_id=19875 a North Carolina attorney. In 1980, the station changed to a \\"soft soul\\" music format and was very successful for a short timeDiscussion with station manager, 1980. For a period of time between 1980 and 1987, the station was programmed with the Z Rock hardcore metal rock music format, and operated with call letters WRZK.Discussion with former station DJ. On June 27, 1988, the station was transferred to Evangel Christian School, Inc. Evangel Christian School changed the call letters to WCIE to match their FM station in Lakeland, Florida, WCIE- FM (91.1). The letters stood for \\"Where Christ is Everything.\\" In September 1989 Evangel stopped providing WCIE with programming by satellite, so the station had to increase its original programming from five hours a week to all the time. WCIE was also non-commercial and did not even charge pastors for airing their messages; an annual \\"Share-a-Thon\\" provided the station with its funding.Ingrid Sauceda, \\"Christian Station Finds 'Blessing,'\\" The Fayetteville Observer, November 13, 1989. For a period of time prior to October 1991, the station \\"went dark\\" and did not transmit.Conversation with former station engineer Terry Jordan, 1991. On January 18, 1996, the station was sold to W & V Broadcasting. For nine months prior to February 14, 1999, W & V Broadcasting, owned by William and Vera Hollingsworth, worked to return WCIE to the air. According to general manager Tammie Hollingsworth, WCIE had been off the air two years when it came back as a black gospel station airing the same programming as co-owned WMFA. The station made its return despite a break-in that resulted in the loss of thousands of dollars of equipment.Bonnie Carlson, \\"WCIE Is Battling Crime to Stay on Air,\\" The Fayetteville Observer, February 23, 1996.Michael Futch, \\"Family Revives Stations with Gospel Music Format,\\" The Fayetteville Observer, April 12, 1996. Late in 1998, WCIE went off the air again because the Highway 210 site was sold to a new owner who did not want the station's tower there. This required the transmitter/tower site to be moved about ¬º mile north to a new location. Late in 1999, the station was sold to Jeffrey Andrulonis's Colonial Radio Group, Inc., owner of WFAI, and the planned format was \\"1450 The Sports Animal.\\"Michael Futch, \\"Station May Offer New Sports Format,\\" The Fayetteville Observer, August 29, 1999.

WCIE aired the area's only local sports-talk show, hosted by Allen Smothers.Michael Futch, \\"All-Sports Radio Station Is on the Air,\\" The Fayetteville Observer, January 20, 2002. Late in June 2002, WCIE became a Spanish language station, the first in the area, with the name \\"Mexicana Musical 1450 AM,\\" and WFAY took over the sports talk format. The new WCIE format would include Spanish Contemporary, tropical music, banda, ranchera, tejano, salsa, and regional Mexican.Michael Futch, \\"Radio Station to Go Spanish,\\" The Fayetteville Observer, June 22, 2002. Early in 2004, Roberto Vengoechea became the new general manager, and \\"La Nueva Radio Latina\\" included an increased focus on Latin and Caribbean listeners, not just Mexicans. In addition to news and information, WCIE played tropical, salsa, merengue and cumbia music. One reason for the changes: the various ethnic groups on the area military bases.Michael Futch, \\"WCIE-AM Grows on Audience,\\" The Fayetteville Observer, February 29, 2004.

He played the majority of his professional career for the club Reims, winning five French championships and appearing in two European Cup finals. He is considered as one of the best central defender of his time.http://www.eurosport.fr/football/robert-jonquet-est- mort_sto1788217/story.shtml Nicknamed \\"The Hero of Highbury\\" after an outstanding individual performance against England in London in 1951, Jonquet was integral to the French national teams of the 1950s, playing at the World Cup finals of 1954 and 1958. Playing career =1946‚Äì1956= During his youth, Jonquet played in the surrounding countryside of southern Paris in Ch√¢tenay-Malabry, and afterwards for the Soci√©t√© Sportive Voltaire. In 1946/47, he played his first season at Reims in the division 1. He became a first-team player, and in the spring 1947, he was called up for the first time to the French national team. Jonquet was relatively short (1.76 m) for his playing position, but as a libero, played with elegance and talent in the number 5 shirt, rather than in the mould of a typical centre-back \\"destroyer\\". In the 1948/49 season he won his first French championship, 1950 the Coupe de France, followed in 1953 by his second French championship and the Latin Cup. In the year after he participated with Les Bleus in its first World Cup finals in Switzerland; in 1955 he won the French championship again, the French Supercup, was finalist in the Latin Cup and the following year (1956) reached with Reims the final of the newly born European Cup, losing to Real Madrid 3:4. Two further high points of these years took place on international fields: in October 1951 with the France he played in London against England (which included Alf Ramsey and Billy Wright). Jonquet's superb game helped France obtain a 2:2 draw, and on the next morning a newspaper headline referred to him as \\"The Hero of Highbury\\".FFF : Equipe de France de Football, football, fiche, Bleus, actualit√©, vid√©o, reportage, photo The \\"hero\\" also played in a European selection which defeated England in a friendly match in 1955. =A main player in one of the best teams of Europe= Robert Jonquet's fellow players with Reims reads like a Who's Who of French football during the 1950s: between goalkeeper (Dominique Colonna) and offensive forces (Raymond Kopa, Michel Hidalgo, L√©on Glovacki, Jean Vincent, Just Fontaine, Roger Piantoni, Ren√© Bliard) stood safe defensive players such as Roger Marche, Armand Penverne, Albert Batteux, Michel Leblond, Jean Wendling ‚Äì and evenly over one decade for Jonquet, who is the only players who played in two finals of the European Cup as well as two finals of the Latin Cup. Albert Batteux by the way accompanied and supported Jonquet career over this time in three different ways: as a fellow players (until 1950), as a manager (1950‚Äì1959) and as French national football coach (starting from 1955). =1957‚Äì1961= The 1957/58 season held further titles but also included probably the blackest hour for Jonquet. With Reims he won the treble of the French Championships Cup and Super Cup. In addition he participated in its second soccer world championship, at 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden where France finished third. However its misfortune in the semi-final (see below) prevented Jonquet's participation in the match for third place (6: 3 against Germany).FFF : Equipe de France de Football, football, fiche, Bleus, actualit√©, vid√©o, reportage, photo After the second European Cup final against rival Real Madrid (1959, 0:2) Raymond Kopa returned from Los Merengues to Reims ‚Äì and Jonquet won his fifth French championship in 1960 and his third Super Cup.

He played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Cincinnati Royals and the Boston Celtics from 1963 to 1968, and from 1968 to 1971, for the American Basketball Association's Indiana Pacers. He is the only player to have played on an NCAA championship team, an ABA championship team, and an NBA championship team. Early life Thacker was born in and grew up in Covington, Kentucky across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, the son of William and Velma Arvin Thacker. He attended Our Savior's High School until integration closed it in 1956. He then attended the all-black William Grant High School, where he played basketball. He averaged 31.7 points per game as a junior and led the team to a 26‚Äì5 record. As a senior, he averaged 33.8 points as the team went 31‚Äì7. He scored 36 points in his final high school game as the team lost the Kentucky state championship game, 85‚Äì84. In 1959 he needed a few credits to earn his degree, so he attended Holmes High School during the summer and graduated. College career Thacker attended the University of Cincinnati and played three varsity seasons for the Bearcats under coach Ed Jucker. As a sophomore in 1960‚Äì61, he averaged 12.3 points per game and was named All-Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) as the Bearcats won the league title. The Bearcats finished the season with a record of 27‚Äì3 and, on March 25, 1961, Cincinnati, led by the balanced attack of Thacker, Bob Wiesenhahn, Tony Yates, Paul Hogue and Carl Bouldin, won the NCAA Championship with a 70‚Äì65 overtime win over the Ohio State Buckeyes. As a junior in 1961‚Äì62, Thacker averaged 11.0 points per game and was again All-MVC. The Bearcats again captured the MVC and posted a 29‚Äì2 record. With Ron Bonham and George Wilson replacing the departed Wiesenhahn and Bouldin, the Bearcats again captured the NCAA title on March 24, 1962, again over Ohio State, 71‚Äì59. As a senior in 1962‚Äì63, he averaged 15.8 points per game, led the team in assists with 4.0 per game, and was named the team MVP. He was also named All-MVC for the third consecutive season. In addition, he was a consensus first-team All- American along with teammate Bonham. The Bearcats, with the same starting lineup as the year before except for Larry Shingleton replacing the departed Hogue, won the league crown yet again and, for the third straight season, advanced to the NCAA championship game. However, on March 23, 1963, the Bearcats lost to Loyola University Chicago. Professional career Thacker was chosen in the first round (fifth overall) of the 1963 NBA draft as a territorial pick by the Cincinnati Royals. During his three seasons with the Royals, he played about nine minutes per game as a backup guard, averaging 2.8, 2.5, and 3.7 points per game, respectively during the 1963‚Äì64 through 1965‚Äì66 seasons. On May 1, 1966 he was drafted by the Chicago Bulls in the NBA expansion draft, but he decided to retire and did not play that season. On August 4, 1967, he returned to the NBA and was signed as a free agent by the Boston Celtics. It turned out to be a fortuitous trade for Thacker. Averaging about 12 minutes per game and 4.2 points and 2.5 rebounds per game, he earned a championship ring as the Celtics won the NBA title in a six-game finals series over the Los Angeles Lakers. He also posted a career single-game high of 17 points twice, on February 11, 1968 against the Lakers and again on March 7 against the Bulls. After Thacker's fourth NBA season, on May 6, 1968, he was drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA expansion draft. However, he opted to play in the American Basketball Association (ABA) for the Indiana Pacers. In 1968‚Äì69, playing just 18 games, he averaged 5.4 points, 3.7 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game, all career personal bests. In 1969‚Äì70, he played 70 games, averaging 2.7 points per game and helped the Pacers capture the ABA championship in six games over the Los Angeles Stars. In his third and final ABA season of 1970‚Äì71, he played eight games and his seven-year professional career ended. Coaching career He became the first African-American coach at the University of Cincinnati, leading the women's basketball program from 1974 to 1978. Thacker was the second coach for the Cincinnati Bearcats women's basketball team and would go on to have an 55‚Äì43 record over four seasons, leading three winning campaigns during his coaching time. Personal life Thacker earned both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from the University of Cincinnati. He is also a member of the Beta Eta chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. Thacker owns his own small business, Tom Thacker Enterprises, in Cincinnati. He has served as deputy director of the Cincinnati Urban League, and he also served as a teacher with Cincinnati Public Schools. In 1986, he was inducted into the Northern Kentucky Sports Hall of Fame and, in 1989, into the Northern Kentucky Black Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Ohio Basketball Hall of Fame at the 11th Annual Ceremony on May 21, 2016 in Columbus.

Schlink first released in 1933 by the Vanguard Press and manufactured in the United States of America. Its central argument propounds that the American population is being used as guinea pigs in a giant experiment undertaken by the American producers of food stuffs and patent medicines and the like. Kallet and Schlink premise the book as being ‚Äúwritten in the interest of the consumer, who does not yet realize that he is being used as a guinea pig‚Ä¶‚Äù Summary The book's key proposition is that a significant portion of the products sold to the public‚Äîparticularly pharmaceuticals and food products‚Äîare released with little regard for or knowledge of how these products adversely affect the consumer. Corporations, often knowingly, release products which either do not do what they purport to do, or have dangerous side effects or defects. Furthermore, many officials and government departments, namely, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, have fallen victim to regulatory capture. The book goes on to state that the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 is not effective in arresting these trends, and real reform or consumer protection is obstructed by the powerful connections that offending corporations have with the government. > If the poison is such that it acts slowly and insidiously, perhaps over a > long period of years (and several such will be considered in later > chapters), then we poor consumers must be test animals all our lives; and > when, in the end, the experiment kills us a year or ten years sooner than > otherwise we would have died, no conclusions can be drawn and a hundred > million others are available for further tests. The authors develop ideas such as synergy effects, and the precautionary and substitution principles. They claim that many toxic substances, even in low concentrations, can act together to cause much more harmful effects than each substance would individually. Prolonged exposure to low amounts of toxic substances, even at very mild concentrations, can potentially have serious negative health impacts that consumers are not made aware of. These impacts are felt by all consumers because harmful substances are being ingested by consumers because of the use of dangerous pesticides, herbicides and other chemicals in food production. Preservatives are particularly criticized, and the increase in canned or packaged foods is cited as evidence of an increasing risk of such synergy effects because of the large amount of chemical byproducts these products include. The book argues that many products would not be sold if properly labeled, and this failure to police product labeling has been a key failing of the Food and Drug Administration. Extensive reform and overhaul in government regulation and inspection of the food and drug industry is needed in order to adequately protect consumers from corporations and manufacturers who do not place the health of the consumer before profit. Examples cited include beauty products, which in the first quarter of the 20th century were found to contain arsenic, lead and even radium, the health effects of which were not understood or known to consumers at the time. The true label for a pineapple pie, they argue, would be closer to this: > Corn starch-filled, glucose-sweetened pie with made with sub-standard canned > pineapple, artificial (citric acid) lemon flavor and artificial coal tar > color. The book takes particular aim at the pharmaceutical market in the United States during the period, citing extensive lists of drugs which are often the subject of very strong and widespread campaigns of media promotion as \\"wonder- drugs,\\" yet which do not have any effect on the conditions they purport to cure, and often carry with them serious side effects that are not revealed to consumers. The authors claim that advertising for these drugs is deliberately misleading and uses a variety of dishonest techniques from false testimonials to fake experts. The authors also question the value of statements made by scientists who vouch for the safety of products, citing the example of a dean of the College of Pharmacy of Columbia University who had vouched for the safety of a drug that later proved fatal to many. In the final analysis, the authors encourage consumers to be more active and questioning in their purchasing habits. Consumers should be vigilant in finding out more information about products and ingredients, and boycotting producers and their products that contain dangerous ingredients. They also call for stronger laws, tougher penalties for offending companies, and a much more concerted effort from authorities to implement consumer protection laws. The book concludes with the statement that \\"Above all, let your voice be heard loudly and often, in protest against indifference, ignorance, and avarice responsible for the uncontrolled adulteration and misrepresentation of foods, drugs, and cosmetics.\\" Reception The book proved to be extremely popular and a national bestseller in the years immediately following its release, and at least 13 printings of the book were published in the first six months of publication. Public reaction to the book was very strong. Many people were shocked at the extent of food contamination and drug side-effects, and 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs, along with several other books of a similar nature, were published during a period when a new consumer movement emerged.Jackson, C. \\"The Ergot Controversy: Prologue to the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act\\" J Hist Med Allied Sci 1968; XXIII: 248-257 It is often cited, along with American Chamber of Horrors by Ruth deForest Lamb, as being one of the key catalysts for increased government regulation over food and drugs in the United States which led to the passage in 1938 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.Mannion, M. \\"Frankenstein Foods\\" The Journal of the Mindshift Institute, Vol.4, 2002 The book was also the subject of strong opposition from several quarters‚Äînot just vested interests such as the drug companies, but also from the medical fraternity. The book was frequently criticized for being sensational propaganda, and many at the time questioned the credentials of the authors (both engineers) and the accuracy of the claims.Kyrk, H. The Journal of Business of the University of Chicago, Vol. 6, No. 4 (Oct., 1933) Several professionals in the medical industry also pointed to the unscientific and spurious conclusions reached, with one commenting on \\"data fantastically exploited and erroneously interpreted,\\" \\"extreme and unrealistic conclusion[s]\\" and \\"authors with technical qualifications more pronounced in the art of sensationalism than [in] the sciences of biology, chemistry, or public health.\\"Tobey, J. Am J Public Health. 1933 May; 23(5): 530‚Äì531 Today, many of the authors' scientific conclusions are indeed thought to have been mistaken. For example, they claimed that bran (roughage) has many negative effects on the intestine, which contradicts today's view that bran in moderation is beneficial to the intestines. However, it still remains an influential book on the topic of consumer affairs. Nearly forty years later, in 1972, John G. Fuller published his expose of the food, drug and cosmetic industries, honoring Kallet and Schlink by entitling his book 200,000,000 Guinea Pigs: New Dangers in Everyday Foods, Drugs and Cosmetics. In the Introduction, Fuller wrote, \\"Today, nearly forty years later, the situation is worse, not better. ‚Ä¶ Time bombs are ticking away in several dark corners. ‚Ä¶ It is 1933 all over again‚Äîmultiplied by logarithms. The difference is only a matter of form.\\"  References  Bibliography *  Further reading  * * Category:1933 non-fiction books Category:Food safety in the United States Category:Vanguard Press books Category:Works about consumer protection Category:Books about United States legal history Category:American non-fiction books Category:Literary collaborations ","title":"100,000,000 Guinea Pigs"},{"id":"10555905","text":"The Helper station is a railroad station in Helper, Utah.

It is served by Amtrak's California Zephyr, which runs once daily between Chicago and Emeryville, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area. Description The station is located on the north side of the tracks and south of 600 South at 300 West. It is easily accessible from 200 West and has six paved parking spaces. There are no services provided at the station (i.e., ticketing, restrooms, lounge, etc.). The station is within walking distance of downtown Provo. The station is located within a Quiet Zone, so all trains (including Utah Transit Authority's FrontRunner and Union Pacific's) do not routinely sound their horns when approaching public crossings within this corridor although they do sound their bells. Even though UTA's FrontRunner commuter rail line uses the same right-of-way through downtown Provo that is used by the California Zephyr, UTA built a separate station of the same name. That station is located one block east on the south side of the tracks. However, there is easy pedestrian access between the two stations and the UTA connecting intra-county and local bus routes. The FrontRunner provides commuter rail service north to Salt Lake City and Ogden, and stops in between. History The station is on the site of a previous station constructed by the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad in 1910. This building remained in use until 1986 when, increasingly dilapidated, it was demolished. The station was little more than a plexiglas bus shelter along the tracks until 2002,, when it was replaced by three decorative shelters, one of which is mostly enclosed and heated. The new station opened 14 May 2002 and cost $120,000 with funds coming from Provo City, Amtrak, and a federal grant. In-kind contributions were also provided by Provo City. Beginning in 1983, both the Desert Wind (with service from Chicago to Los Angeles) and the Pioneer (with service from Chicago to Seattle) previously stopped at the Provo Station. Service by the Pioneer was dropped when that train was rerouted through Wyoming in 1991 (the train was later discontinued altogether in 1997). Service by the Desert Wind ended when Amtrak discontinued that train in 1997 (at the same time as the Pioneer was discontinued). Although the ultimate western end of the line for the Desert Wind was in Los Angeles (southwest of the Provo Station), the train route ran north to Salt Lake City before heading south to its next stop in Milford, Utah (Delta from 1983-1988).

Silvestre was the son of the lieutenant colonel of artillery Victor Fern√°ndez and Eleuteria Silvestre. In 1889 he enrolled in the Toledo Infantry Academy, where he met with the future high commissioner of Spanish Morocco, D√°maso Berenguer. He committed suicide on the battlefield following the disastrous defeat at Annual of 22 July 1921 suffered by the Spanish army under his command.Henry Marchat Henry. \\"La France et l'Espagne au Maroc pendant la p√©riode du Protectorat (1912-1956)\\", Revue de l'Occident musulman et de la M√©diterran√©e, no. 10, 1971. p. 84. Career =Cuba= Silvestre first saw action in 1890 at the age of 19 in a skirmish as a cadet against the Mambises guerrillas seeking independence in Cuba. In February 1895, a full-blown rebellion broke out in Cuba, known as the Cuban War of Independence. After he attended the academy, Silvestre returned to Cuba in 1895 to fight against the Mambises until the Spanish lost the 1898 Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in which he received 16 wounds altogether and received a severe incapacity of the left arm that he disguised very well.Perry, James Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them, Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 276 During his time in Cuba, the aggressive Silvestre had a marked preference for cavalry charges and fighting hand to hand against the Mambises and was widely liked and respected by the men under his command.Woolman, David Rebels in the Rif, Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1988, p. 45. A charismatic, charming man whose nickname was Manolo, Silvestre was a great womaniser who fathered scores of illegitimate children by the various women he seduced. In the words of the American historian David Woolman: \\"Silvestre was a real-life character as flamboyant as any to be found in the pages of a romantic novel\\". Silvestre was a very brave but reckless junior officer in Cuba, where he was seriously wounded during a cavalry action, but as a general, he was hopelessly inept and owned his rapid rise up the ranks to the patronage of his best friend, King Alfonso XIII, who used his position of commander-in-chief to promote his favourite officers. After the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Silvestre served as a military aide to the king, who became his patron. When Alfonso ascended to the Spanish throne in 1886, Spain could at least pretence to be a world power, as Spain had colonies in the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Pacific. The great shattering event of Alfonso's childhood had been the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898, which saw Spain defeated by the Americans and the loss of Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam, and shortly afterward, Spain sold the Carolines and Mariana islands to Germany. As a result, Spain's empire now consisted only of Spanish Guinea, in Central Africa, and some footholds on the Moroccan coast. Alfonso had taken the losses of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War very badly and supported the africanistas, who longed to conquer for Spain a new empire in Northern Africa to compensate for the lost empire in the Americas and Asia.Perry, James Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them, Edison: Castle Books, 2005, p. 274. As a militarist educated by army officers and an africanista, Alfonso liked swashbuckling, macho generals who might conquer for him an African empire; which explained why Silvestre became a royal favourite. Alfonso was fascinated by Silvestre's flamboyant and colourful personality, which made him popular \\"both with his troops and with the ladies.\\" =Spanish Morocco= In 1904, after many postings to peninsular regiments, he was dispatched to the Spanish exclave of Melilla on the Mediterranean Rif coast of North Africa, where he proved to be an excellent negotiator but also a fierce and an unpredictable man. In 1912, he occupied Larache and in 1918, he became the Commandant-General of Ceuta. As such he reported to the High Commissioner, a position that was filled by D√°maso Berenguer. Silvestre and Berenguer had once been friends at the military school, but they had fallen out as Silvestre was actually senior on the officer's list although Berenguer's position as High Commissioner meant that Silvestre had to take orders from him. Berenguer regarded Silvestre as reckless but was unwilling to rein him in largely because his friendship with the king, who had the final say over who was promoted and when.Perry, James Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them, Edison: Castle Books, 2005, p. 277 Silvestre led several campaigns against Mulai Ahmed er Raisuni, a notorious North Moroccan brigand, from 1913 to 1920. After a long struggle, Silvestre defeated Raisuni in October 1919 in the Battle of Fondak Pass. Although Raisuni and most of his troops managed to slip away, they eventually joined forces with the Spanish authority against rival rebel leader Abd el-Krim. Raisuni's army was key to the Spanish capture of Larache and Arcila and to contain Abd El-Krim's offensives in 1923 and 1924, but he ended up as a prisoner of Abd El-Krim, who had him executed in 1925. Silvestre as a colonel in his office in 1913 After stopping in Ceuta, Silvestre marched in 1920 to take command of the Command of Melilla from where in January 1921 he led the Rif invasion, to stop the local resistance, now led by Abd el-Krim. Berenguer commanded from his headquarters at T√©touan, south of Ceuta, and Silvestre was based at Meilila, 130 miles away, a command arrangement that did not facilitate smooth co-operation between the two generals. In March 1921, Silvestre met Berenguer aboard the old cruiser Princesa de Asturias to plan the operations in the spring.Perry, James Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them, Edison: Castle Books, 2005, l. 277. Silvestre dismissed the Moroccans as an enemy, said he had all the troops and equipment that he needed, and causally mentioned: \\"The only way to succeed in Morocco is to cut off the heads of all the Moors\\". French Marshal Hubert Lyautey, who commanded the forces in French Morocco, complained that the Spanish lacked sufficient cultural sensitivity and often gratuitously offended the Islamic traditions of the Moroccans by openly engaging the services of the ubiquitous prostitutes, who followed the Spanish Army everywhere in Morocco; by engaging in harassment of Muslims on the streets; by dishonest and bigoted treatment of Moroccan tribal chiefs; and by all too often simply assuming that an \\"iron fist\\" approach was the best way to deal with the Moroccans. Lyautey criticised the Spanish Army in Morocco in general, but Silvestre exemplified it perfectly with his arrogance that led him to dismiss the Moroccans as hopelessly inferior and his firm belief in the \\"iron fist\\". The operation was risky and dangerous since the Spanish soldiers were very poorly trained and scared of the Rifians. Silvestre's force comprised 20,000 Spanish soldiers, as well as 5,000 regulares, as Moroccans in the Spanish Army were called. Of the Spanish troops, well over half were completely illiterate conscripts from the poorest elements of Spanish society and had been sent to Morocco with minimal training. Despite Silvestre's assurances that his equipment was sufficient to defeat the Rifians, about three quarters of the rifles at the Melilla arsenal were in shoddy condition because of poor maintenance, and a report from late 1920, which Silvestre had never bothered to read, warned that many of the rifles in Melilla arsenal were unusable or more of a danger to the soldier who was firing them than to the enemy.Perry, James Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them, Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 278 The average Spanish soldier in Morocco in 1921 was paid the equivalent of US$0.34 per day and lived on a simple diet of coffee, bread, beans, rice and the odd piece of meat. Many soldiers bartered their rifles and ammunition at the local markets in exchange for fresh vegetables. The barracks that the soldiers lived in were unsanitary, and medical care at the few hospitals was very poor. Up in the mountains, Spanish soldiers lived in small outposts known as blocaos, which the American historian Stanley Payne observed: \\"Many of these lacked any sort of toilet, and the soldier who ventured out of the filthy bunker risked exposure to the fire of lurking tribesmen\\".Perry, James Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them, Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 278. Continuing a practice first began in Cuba, corruption flourished in the venal Spanish officer corps, with goods meant for the troops being sold onto the black market, and the funds intended to build road and railroads in Morocco ended up in the pockets of senior officers. A shockingly high number of Spanish officers could not read maps, which explains why Spanish units so frequently got lost in the Rif. In general, studying war was not considered to be a good use of an officer's time, and most officers devoted their time in Melilla in words of the American journalist James Perry to \\"gambling and whoring, sometimes molesting the native Moorish women\\". Morale in the army was extremely poor, and most Spanish soldiers just wanted to go home and leave Morocco forever. Because of the prostitutes from Spain, who attached themselves in great number to the Spanish bases in Morocco, venereal diseases were rampant in the Spanish Army, as it was the great dream of many Spanish soldiers to contract a venereal disease so he could invalidated out of service and sent home to Spain. Silvestre was well aware of the poor morale of his soldiers, but he did not regard it as a problem since he believed that his enemy was so inferior that the problems afflicting his troops would not be an issue. General Silvestre with other senior officers of the Spanish Armed Forces. Silvestre had spread out his troops in 144 forts and blockhouses (blocaos) from Sidi Dris on the Mediterranean across the Rif to Annual and Tizi Azza and on to Melilla. A typical blockhouse held about a dozen men while the larger forts had about 800 men. Silvestre, known for his boldness and impetuosity had pushed his men too deep into the mountains hoping to reach Alhucemas Bay without undertaking the necessary work to built a logistical support network capable of supplying his men out in the blocaos up in the Rif mountains.Alvarez, Jose \\"Between Gallipoli and D-Day: Alhucemas, 1925\\" pages 75-98 from The Journal of Military History, Vol. 63, No. 1, January 1999, p. 81. Krim had sent Silvestre a letter warning him not to cross the Amekran River, or he would die.Perry, James Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them, Edison: Castle Books, 2005, p. 279 Silvestre commented to the Spanish press about the letter: \\"This man Abd el- Krim is crazy. I'm not going to take seriously the threats of a little Berber caid [judge] whom I had at my mercy a short time ago. His insolence merits a new punishment\\".Perry, James Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them, Edison: Castle Books, 2005, p. 279. Krim allowed Silvestre to advance deep into since he knew that the Spanish logistics were, in the words of the Spanish historian Jose Alvarez, \\"tenuous\\" at best. In late May 1921, Silvestre had his first inking of trouble, as he received reports that his supply columns he was sending up into the Rif were regularly being destroyed. As Silvestre had pushed his men very deep into the Rif, and his forts and blocaos held little in the way of food, the ambushes threatened to bring down the entire chain that Silvestre had built. On 29 May 1921, Silvestre wrote to Berenguer for the first time that the campaign against Krim might be more than a \\"mere kick in the pants\\" and that he needed more troops fast. However, in the words of Perry, \\"this stupid man\\" marched across the Amekran River to occupy the village Abaran on June 1, 1921. Most of the soldiers were regulares who promptly mutinied, murdered their Spanish officers and declared that they were now joining the jihad that Krim had proclaimed against the Spanish. After the debacle, Berenguer paid an emergency visit to Melilla to meet with Silvestre to \\"suggest\\" the latter to suspend his attempts to push over the Amekran River until Berenguer could \\"pacify\\" his zone south of Ceuta and start a supporting offensive from the west. Silvestre wanted to hear nothing of Berenguer's \\"suggestions\\" and said that unless he received a direct order to stop, he could continue his attempts to push Spanish power beyond the Amekran. Silvestre was so angry with the \\"suggestions\\" that he attempted to attack Berenguer and had to be restrained by the other officers. Though Berenguer continued to \\"suggest\\" to Silvestre caution in a steady stream of telegrams over the following days and advised no operations beyond the Amekran, he never ordered Silvestre to stop for fear of angering Silvestre's patron, Alfonso XIII, which meant that the stubborn Silvestre continued to press on. The local resistance began to believe that they were able to defeat the Spanish when, on June 1, 1921, it took the position from Abarr√°n, killing many Spanish soldiers in combat. On June 8, 1921, Silvestre again sent his men south of the Amekran to start building a fort at Igueriben. Krim then out a proclamation to all the Berber tribes of the Rif: \\"The Spaniards have already lost the game. Look At Abaran! They have left their dead mutilated and unburied, their souls vaguely wandering about, tragically denied the delights of Paradise!\\"Perry, James Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them, Edison: Castle Books, 2005 pages 279-280. The Rifians now surrounded the new Spanish base at Igueriben and used captured Spanish artillery to bring down fire on the Spanish.Perry, James Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them, Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 280. Then, Silvestre sent a telegram to Berenguer saying that the situation had become \\"somewhat delicate\\" and that he desperately needed more troops. Silvestre now started to worry, as he had much trouble sleeping and eating. However, Silvestre's doubts were quietened when King Alfonso sent him a telegram, whose first line was \\"Hurrah for real men!\\", and it urged his favorite general to stay the course and not to retreat. With that, any possibility of retreat vanished, as Silvestre would never displease the king. Moroccan child. The Spanish garrison at Igueriben was cut off but could communicate with the fort at Annual via heliograph. From the heliograph, Silvestre learned that the men at Igueriben had no water and been reduced to drinking the juice from tomato cans, then vinegar and ink, and finally their own urine. With the dehydrated men of Igueriben in desperate condition, a relief force from Annual was sent down on July 19 but was ambushed and destroyed, with 152 Spanish killed. On July 21, Silvestre sent down another relief force of 3000 men, which was likewise ambushed and defeated.  Battle of Annual  After the fall of Igueriben on July 22, the rebels attacked the Spanish military camp. Silvestre, who had been acting more and more irrationally since the previous setbacks, ordered Major Julio Benitez to break out, which led to Benitez and most of his men being hacked to death by the Moroccan tribesmen, who rarely gave the Spanish much mercy. Only 11 survivors of Igueriben managed to reach the fort at Annual, and 9 of them died within hours of heat exhaustion. Then, Silvestre fell to pieces, chewed obsessively at his mustache and talked gibberish to himself as he paced back and forth, wondering what he should do. Matters were decided for Silvestre as Krim decided to follow up his victory at Igueriben by besieging the Annual fortress, and a few hours later, his tribesmen had surrounded Annual.Perry, James Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them, Edison: Castle Books, 2005, p. 281. At that point, a panic-stricken Silvestre, who having previously underestimated Krim now swung to the other extreme and called a council of war to announce he was ordering a general retreat back to the coast. Silvestre sent his last message on the radio to Madrid at about 4:55 a.m. that he would start a retreat to the coast later that morning. Silvestre failed to organize an orderly retreat, not least because for reasons of machismo, he was unwilling to admit to his men that they would be about to retreat. At about 10 am on 22 July 1921, the 5000 men of the Annual started to march out of the fort without being told why. As the Spanish marched in such a disorganised fashion with no officers to give them direction or orders that in the words of the British historian Admiral Cecil Usborne: \\"Units broke up and became incoherent\\", as men started to head off in every direction amid \\"the terrible heat and dust of the Moroccan summer\\". With Spanish having no order, the Moroccans had no trouble cutting them down with writhing fire, which, in turn, led to the Spanish taking off helter-skelter with every man for himself to the mountains. The Rif tribesmen cut them down with their swords, and others were \\"shot down like rabbits\\" with the smiling tribesmen openly standing up to shoot down the Spanish as if it was all a game to them. The Rifians used up almost all of their ammunition, but they captured so many Spanish guns and ammunition as to come out of the battle with more ammunition than they had started with.Perry, James Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them, Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 282. In the meantime, the Rifians had smashed through the gates of the Annual and went about killing every Spaniard they encountered. The Rifians gave no mercy and cut down not only the Spanish soldiers but also the Spanish prostitutes, who had followed the troops up into the Rif. While that was happening, Silvestre stood on the parapet of the Annual fortress, watching his army being destroyed. With the exception of one cavalry unit, the Cazadores de Alc√°ntara, the entire garrison of about 5000 men were lost. Silvestre reportedly further demoralised his men by yelling at them, \\"Run, run, the bogeyman is coming!\\" as they attempted to rally following their initial defeat.Woolman, David S. Rebels in the Rif: Abd el-Krim and the Rif Rebellion (Stanford: University Press, 1988), 91 Silvestre's comments about the \\"bogeyman\\" were his only contributions to the command of his army during the Annual battle. Of the 570 Spaniards who survived the \\"Disaster of Annual\\", the 326 who were taken prisoner were released in January 1923 after the Spanish state paid a ransom of four million pesetas. The survivors consisted of 44 officers, 236 soldiers, 10 civilians and 33 prostitutes and their children. Death According to some witnesses, Silvestre, upon seeing the disaster, went into his tent and committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. Whether dead by his own hand or like most of his staff killed in the turmoil of the retreat, the only remnant of Silvestre appears to have been his scarlet and gold general's sash. Captain Fortea, one of the few Spanish prisoners taken at Annual, reported that Abd el-Krim wore the sash during the pursuit. Abd el-Krim himself told the writer J. Roger-Mathieu that this and other insignia had been brought to him by one of his men.Woolman, David Rebels in the Rif, Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1988 page 91. A total of 15,000 Spanish soldiers fell in the days from July 22 to August 9; most died during the Battle of Annual (known as the Disaster of Annual to Spanish historians). Krim followed up his victory at Annual by laying siege to all of the blocaos in the Riff mountains, none of which had much food or water stored, and all of which he took. After the Annual rout, Spanish morale collapsed and there was very little attempt at organized resistance, with the commanders of every blocao making no effort at any organized retreat. On that final day, Silvestre's deputy, General Felipe Navarro y Ceballos-Escalera, surrendered with his men at the sprawling fort of Mount Arruit.

Born in Tubberadora, County Tipperary, Maher first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-five when he made his senior debut in the 1895 championship. Maher went on to play a key part for Tipperary in what was a hugely successful era, and won five All-Ireland medals and five Munster medals. Maher was the first player to captain a team to All-Ireland success on three occasions. At club level Maher won three championship medals with Tubberadora. Maher's retirement came following the conclusion of the 1904 championship. Biography Mikey Maher was born in Tubberadora, County Tipperary in 1870. He was educated at the local national school and later worked on the family farm. Maher was the second eldest in a family of four boys, all of whom had a great interest in the game of hurling. Maher's older brother, Jack, won two All-Ireland medals in the 1890s. Two of Maher's nephews, Sonny Maher and Michael Maher, won All- Ireland medals with Tipperary in the 1950s and 1960s. In retirement from hurling Maher returned to working on the family farm. In 1918 he moved to a farm in Galbally, County Limerick where he spent the rest of his life. Mikey Maher died in 1947. Playing career =Club= Maher played his club hurling with his local Tubberadora club and enjoyed much success. He won senior county championship titles with the club in 1895, 1896 and 1898. Tubberadora never again won another senior county title. =Inter-county= Maher first came to prominence on the inter-county scene with Tipperray in 1890. Cork, however, were the standard bearers in the province of Munster at the time. In 1895 Maher was selected to captain the Tipperary senior hurling team. That year Tipp faced Limerick in the provincial final and the game turned into a rout. Tipperary won the game by 7-8 to 0-2 giving Maher his first Munster title. Tipperary later played Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final to be played at what is now Croke Park. Tipp took a 1-6 to 1-0 lead at half- time and went on to hammer ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô by 6-8 to 1-10 at the final whistle. Tipperary's Paddy Riordan is said to have scored all but one point of his team's total as Maher collected his first All-Ireland title. Maher was captain again in 1896 as Tipperary played Cork in the Munster final. That game had to end before the official finish and a replay took place. Tipp easily won the replay by 7-9 to 2-3. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Tipperary play Dublin at the famous Jones's Road ground. Tipp scored a goal in the very first minute and took a 4-6 to 0-1 lead at half-time. The game turned into a rout as Tipperary won by 8-14 to 0-4 giving Maher a second All-Ireland title. This game still holds the record as the most one-sided All-Ireland final. Tipp surrendered their provincial crown in 1897, however, the team took on Cork in the 1898 Munster final. That game had to be abandoned due to fading light, however, Maher collected a third provincial title as Tipp easily defeated ‚Äòthe Rebels‚Äô in the replay. Galway fell heavily in the penultimate game of the championship, allowing Tipp to advance to the All-Ireland final against Kilkenny. In a high-scoring and exciting game Kilkenny were on top for the first twenty-five minutes. In the second-half Tipp took the upper hand with Maher scoring three goals. A 7-13 to 3-10 score line gave Tipp the victory and gave Maher a third All-Ireland title as captain. 1899 saw Tipperary defeat Clare in the provincial decider giving Maher his fourth Munster title. It was another rout as the 5-16 to 0-8 score line suggests. This victory allowed Maher's team to advance directly to the All-Ireland final where Wexford provided the opposition. Wexford held Tipp for the first fifteen minutes; however, they still took a 2-6 to 1-3 lead at half-time. Maher's side went on the rampage in the second half and finished with a score of 3-12 to 1-4. The Wexford team walked off the field with ten minutes left in the game because they couldn't find a substitute for an injured player. Tipp were awarded the title and Maher collected his fourth All-Ireland title. In 1900 Tipperary trounced Kerry by 6-11 to 1-9 in the provincial final, giving Maher his fifth Munster title. Tipp later narrowly defeated Kilkenny in the All-Ireland semi- final before trouncing Galway in the ‚Äòhome‚Äô All-Ireland final. This was not the end of the championship campaign because, for the first year ever, the ‚Äòhome‚Äô finalists had to take on London in the real All-Ireland final. The game was a close affair with both sides level at 0-5 with eight minutes to go. London then took the lead; however, they later conceded a free. Maher stepped up, took the free and a forward ‚Äòcharge‚Äô carried the sliothar over the line. Tipp scored another goal following a weak puck out and claimed the victory. It was Maher's fifth and final All-Ireland title. He retired from inter-county hurling shortly afterwards.

As an adherent of the Four Field School of American anthropology, he stresses the integration of physical anthropology, linguistics, archaeology, and cultural anthropology in solving anthropological problems. Career Since 1965, Fleming had been affiliated with Boston University, continuing to the present as Research Fellow in the African Studies Center and Emeritus Professor of Anthropology. He conducted extensive field work in Northeast Africa, mostly in Ethiopia. Using data from field work by himself and others, Fleming studied and published touching each of the four language groupings in Ethiopia: Semitic, Cushitic (1976),Fleming, Harold. 1964. ‚ÄúBaiso and Rendille: Somali Outliers.‚Äù Rassegna di Studi Etiopici XX. 35‚Äì96.

Early in his career, Fleming published a paper (Fleming 1969) that outlined an important taxonomic proposal, claiming that what had up to then been known as the \\"Western Cushitic\\" language family was not a part of Cushitic at all, but instead makes up a sixth primary branch of Afroasiatic, for which he coined the name Omotic. The proposal has since been widely but not universally accepted. He continued in the vein of solving taxonomic problems involving the languages spoken in Africa and worldwide (Fleming 1976, 1987, 1988, 1991, 2002, 2006, etc.). Fleming was a vocal advocate of, and practitioner in, the effort to extend the application of historical linguistic methods as far as possible into the past. He recommended integrating its results with those of physical anthropology, genetics, and archaeology, in order to produce a unified view of human prehistory. Fleming was also a strong supporter of the sometimes controversial proposals of Joseph Greenberg, emphasizing the success of Greenberg's classification of \\"1500 [African] languages into four large taxa where almost all have stayed ever since\\" (Fleming 2000-2001). In 1986, Fleming met the young members of the \\"Moscow Circle\\" of historical linguists. He was deeply impressed by the long- range linguistic probing of scholars in Moscow who were trying to extend genetic taxonomy of human languages beyond the levels achieved in the 1950s and 1960s. In the fall of 1986, Fleming began circulating letters to linguists and anthropologists outside of Russia. By the fourth issue (November 1987), the newsletter had acquired a more formal appearance and the name Mother Tongue. In 1989, what had been the \\"Long Range Comparison Club\\" was legally incorporated as the Association for the Study of Language In Prehistory (ASLIP).Mother Tongue - Long Ranger Fleming has served as President of ASLIP (1988‚Äì1996), Secretary-Treasurer (1996‚Äì98), and Vice President and Acting Treasurer (2004‚Äìpresent). ASLIP's mission is \\"to encourage international, interdisciplinary information sharing, discussion, and debate among biogeneticists, paleoanthropologists, archaeologists, and historical linguists on questions relating to the emerging synthesis on language origins and ancestral human spoken languages.\\" Since 1995, ASLIP has published the journal Mother Tongue.

Little is known of this king who has not left any inscriptions. Artatama is referred to in the Amarna letters as an ancestor who established an alliance with Thutmose IV of Egypt. According to modern interpretation of scarce available sources, Artatama came to power when the Mitanni kingdom was severely weakened by the Hittite invasion.Bryce, p. 144. Facing the perils of fighting a war on two fronts, the Hittites in the north and Egypt in the south, Artatama approached Amenhotep II with an offer of peaceful division of contested lands in Syria. A peaceful resolution of an old conflict could grow into a political and military alliance, but the Egyptians suspected foul play and denied definite answer for years.Bryce, pp. 144-145. At one point during the reign of Thutmose IV they proposed a marriage between Thutmose and Artatama's daughter, but for unknown reasons Artatama rejected the offer.Bryce, p. 145. The Egyptians had to make seven consecutive marriage proposals before Artatama finally agreed. Thus, Artatama may have been the father of Queen Mutemwiya and the maternal grandfather of Amenhotep III. Artatama was succeeded by his son Shuttarna II. Notes Sources * Bryce, Trevor (2005).

It is understood that the poem was written in the Haworth parsonage, two years after Bront√´ had left Roe Head, where she was unable to settle as a pupil. At that time, she had already lived through the death of her mother and two of her sisters. As the daughter of a parson, Bronte received a rigorously religious education, which is evident in much of her work. \\"Lines\\" is representative of much of her poetry, which broke Victorian gender stereotypes by adopting the Gothic tradition and genre of Romanticism, allowing her to express and examine her emotions. Throughout their lives, the Bront√´ children struggled with leaving their own home in Haworth to which they felt so closely attached. The gender prejudice of the nineteenth century left little choice for young women like Bront√´ who were seeking employment, occupation or education. It was widely accepted that females would hold self-effacing roles as housewives, mothers, governesses or seamstresses. Any poetry written by females was expected to address issues of religion, motherhood and wifehood on an instructive and educative level. The Bront√´s subverted these stereotypes, choosing to write on topics such as death and love. The family lived in a parsonage opposite the church graveyard and was plagued with poor health and loss of life; inevitably death appears frequently in the writings of each. The poem The poem is structured in four stanzas of four lines each:  Criticism  The poem begins prominently with \\"I die\\", immediately setting the tone for the poem which describes Bront√´'s feelings concerning death. Bront√´ gives the impression of indifference to death. Death will free her from \\"earthly cares\\" and \\"distress\\". It is possible to interpret this attitude as death as relief from the suffering she has endured while mourning the losses in her family. As a teenager, it seems strange for Bront√´ to be writing of her own death; however the presence of death in her life would have been inescapable. Using metaphor, she describes a \\"sea of gloom\\" over which she passes to be \\"anchored\\". This appears to be her interpretation of life as uncertain and relentless. She sees security in death which will allow her to \\"rest\\" and remain \\"safe\\" from the torment of \\"tears\\" and \\"mourning\\". It is by now clear, at the end of the second stanza, that death itself is a desirable escape from the repercussions it brings into life. Bront√´ continues with the metaphor of life as the \\"Ocean\\", using adjectives such as \\"dark\\" and \\"drear\\" to describe it negatively. It becomes apparent that death is a safe haven for Bronte. Death is represented by the \\"shore\\", where the troubles of \\"storms\\" and \\"fears\\" cannot reach. The final stanza is more positive and adopts a different perspective on life and death. Displaying her religious beliefs, she pitches the insignificant length of time against the afterlife which will last for \\"eternity\\". Life is \\"nothing to eternity\\", especially when the afterlife can unite Bront√´ with her lost family members. She seeks to prove the greatness of such a place where \\"ages never die\\". With enjambment and without punctuation, Bront√´ creates the effect that life is transient, death is close and that the pains and \\"fears\\" of living will not be endured for long.

It is also frequently called Neues Bauen (\\"New Building\\". The New Objectivity remodeled many German cities in this period. Werkbund and Expressionism Gropius and Meyer's Fagus Factory The earliest examples of the style actually date to before the First World War, under the auspices of the Deutscher Werkbund's attempt to provide a modern face for Germany. Many of the architects who would become associated with the New Objectivity were practicing in a similar manner in the 1910s, using glass surfaces and severe geometric compositions. Examples of this include Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer's 1911 Fagus Factory or Hans Poelzig's 1912 department store in Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw). However, in the aftermath of the war these architects (as well as others such as Bruno Taut) worked in the revolutionary Arbeitsrat f√ºr Kunst, pioneering Expressionist architecture, particularly through the secret Glass Chain group. The early works of the Bauhaus, such as the Sommerfeld House, were in this vein. Expressionism's dynamism and use of glass (whether for transparency or colour effects) would be a mainstay of the New Objectivity. Effects of De Stijl and Constructivism The turn from Expressionism towards the more familiarly Modernist styles of the mid-late 1920s came under the influence of the Dutch avant-garde, particularly De Stijl, whose architects such as Jan Wils and JJP Oud had adapted ideas derived from Frank Lloyd Wright into cubic social housing, inflected with what Theo van Doesburg called 'the machine aesthetic'. Also steering German architects away from Expressionism was the influence of Constructivism, particularly of VKhUTEMAS and El Lissitzky, who stayed in Berlin frequently during the early 1920s. Another element was the work in France of Le Corbusier, such as the proposals for the concrete 'Citrohan' house. In addition, Erich Mendelsohn had already been veering away from Expressionism towards more streamlined, dynamic forms, such as in his Mossehaus newspaper offices and the Gliwice Weichsmann factory, both 1921‚Äì2. Early houses and estates Bruno Taut, Onkel-Toms-H√ºtte, Wilskistrasse, Berlin Perhaps the earliest examples of the 'New Building' in Germany were at the 1922 Bauhaus exhibition, Georg Muche's Haus am Horn, and in the same year, Gropius/Meyer's design for Chicago's Tribune Tower competition. However, the fullest early exploration of a new, non- expressionist avant-garde idiom was in the 1923‚Äì24 'Italienischer Garten' in Celle by Otto Haesler. This was the first Modernist Siedlung (literally \\"settlement\\", though \\"estate\\" would be more precise), an area of new-build social housing characterised by flat roofs, an irregular, asymmetrical plan, with houses arranged in south-facing terraces with generous windows and rendered surfaces. Contrary to the 'white box' idea later popularised by the International Style, these were frequently painted in bright colors. The strongest proponent of color among the housing architects was Bruno Taut. New Frankfurt Ernst May, 'Zig-Zag Houses' in Frankfurt The major expansion of this came with the appointment of Ernst May to the position of city architect and planner by the Social Democratic administration of Frankfurt-am- Main. May was trained by the British garden city planner Raymond Unwin, and his Siedlungen showed garden city influence in their use of open space: they totally repudiated the nostalgic style of Unwin's projects such as Hampstead Garden Suburb. May's 'New Frankfurt' would be enormously important for the subsequent development of the New Objectivity, not only because of its striking appearance but also in its success in quickly re-housing thousands of the city's poor. However, their advanced techniques often alienated the building profession, much of whom were made superfluous by the lack of ornament and speed of construction. May would also employ other architects in Frankfurt such as Margarete Sch√ºtte-Lihotzky (where she developed the Frankfurt kitchen) and Mart Stam. The immediate effect of May's work can be seen in Gropius's 1926 Siedlung Dessau-T√∂rten in Dessau (built around the same time as the more famous Bauhaus building), which also pioneered prefabrication technology. That Germany had become the centre of the New Building ‚Äì as it was called, in preference to 'the New Architecture' ‚Äì was confirmed by the Werkbund's Weissenhof Estate of 1927, where despite the presence of Le Corbusier and JJP Oud, most of the architects were German speaking. Further, Werkbund Estate-exhibitions were mounted in Wroc≈Çaw and Vienna in subsequent years. Functionalism and the Minimum Dwelling Bruno Taut, flats in Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg The architects of the New Objectivity were eager to build as much cost-effective housing as possible, partly to address Germany's postwar housing crisis, and partly to fulfill the promise of Article 155 of the 1919 Weimar Constitution, which provided for \\"a healthy dwelling\\" for all Germans. This phrase drove the technical definition of Existenzminimum (subsistence dwelling) in terms of minimally-acceptable floorspace, density, fresh air, access to green space, access to transit, and other such resident issues. At the same time there was a massive expansion of the style across German cities. In Berlin, architect-planner Martin Wagner worked with the former Expressionists Bruno Taut and Hugo H√§ring on colourful developments of flats and terraced houses such as the 1925 Horseshoe Estate, the 1926 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' (Onkel-Toms-H√ºtte) and the 1929 'Carl-Legien-Siedlung', through the auspices of the Trade Unionist building society GEHAG. Taut's designs featured controversially modern flat roofs, humane access to sun, air and gardens, and generous amenities like gas, electric light, and bathrooms. Critics on the political Right complained that these developments were too opulent for 'simple people'. The progressive Berlin mayor Gustav B√∂ss defended them: \\"We want to bring the lower levels of society higher.\\" Similar experiments in municipal socialism such as the Viennese Gemeindebau were more stylistically eclectic, so Frankfurt and Berlin's authorities were taking a gamble on public approval of the new style. Karl Schneider, flats in Hamburg, 1929 Elsewhere, Karl Schneider designed Estates in Hamburg, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe designed low-cost houses in Berlin's Afrikanische Strasse (and in 1926, a monument to Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht) while straight- aligned, and to their critics, schematic Zeilenbau flats were built to the designs of Otto Haesler, Gropius and others in Dammerstock, Karlsruhe. The term Functionalism began to be used to denote the rather severe, nothing superfluous ethos of the New Objectivity, being used as early as 1925 by Adolf Behne in his book Der Moderne Zweckbau (\\"The Modern Functional Building\\"). In 1926, practically all Modernist German architects organised themselves into a group known as Der Ring, which attracted criticism from soon to be-Nazi architects like Paul Schultze-Naumburg, who formed in response. In 1928 the CIAM had formed, and its earliest conferences, dedicated to questions of Existenzminimum were dominated by the social programmes of German architects. Spread of the New Objectivity Student halls of residence, ADGB Trade Union School, 1928‚Äì1930 A leftist, technologically oriented wing of the movement had formed in Switzerland and the Netherlands, the so-called ABC Group. It was made up of collaborators of El Lissitzky such as Mart Stam and Hannes Meyer, whose greatest work was the glassy expanse of the Van Nelle Factory in Rotterdam. The clean lines of the New Objectivity were also being used for schools and public buildings, by May in Frankfurt, in Hannes Meyer's ADGB Trade Union School in Bernau and Max Taut's Alexander von Humboldt School in Berlin, as well as police administration and office buildings in Berlin under Martin Wagner. Cinemas, which would be very influential on Streamline Moderne picture palaces, were designed by Erich Mendelsohn (Kino-Universum, now Schaub√ºhne am Lehniner Platz, Berlin, 1926) and Hans Poelzig (Kino Babylon, Rosa-Luxemburg-Strasse, Berlin, 1927‚Äì28) A composite style that used the new forms with more traditional masonry building was developed by Poelzig with his Haus des Rundfunks in Berlin and IG Farben Building in Frankfurt, and by Emil Fahrenkamp in his undulating Berlin Shell-Haus. Meanwhile, Erich Mendelsohn's architecture had developed into a 'dynamic functionalism' for commerce, seen in his curvaceous department stores such as the Columbus-Haus in Berlin (demolished in the 1950s) and in the Schocken Department Stores, in Stuttgart (demolished in the 1960s) Chemnitz and Wroc≈Çaw. In Munich Robert Vorhoelzer and Robert Poeverlein founded the \\"Bayerische Postbauschule\\" and built many modernist post offices while the architectural mainstream of 1920s and 1930s Munich still preferred the nostalgic \\"Heimatstil\\". The Great Depression, beginning in 1929, had a disastrous effect on the New Building, because of Germany's financial dependence on the USA. Many estates and projects planned in Frankfurt and Berlin were postponed indefinitely, while the architectural profession became politically polarised, something symbolised by the sacking in 1930 of the Marxist Bauhaus director Hannes Meyer‚Äîwho had stressed, with his collaborators Ludwig Hilberseimer and Mart Stam, the importance of working class and collective housing‚Äîto be replaced by Mies van der Rohe, whose Barcelona Pavilion and Tugendhat House had gained him a reputation as a purveyor of luxury to the rich, and proceeded to turn the Bauhaus into a private school. Dispersal and exile Flats in Berlin-Siemenstadt, Hans Scharoun Important work within Germany continued into the early 1930s, particularly the Ring's Siemensstadt Estate in Berlin, which was planned by Hans Scharoun as a more individual and humane version of the 'existence minimum' residential housing formula. But the political mood turned uglier through that time, with open hostile press, and direct pressure on Jewish and/or Social Democratic architects to leave the country. Many prominent German modernists went to the Soviet Union. Since 1920, Moscow had been the site of the Russian state-run art and technical school, a close parallel to the Bauhaus, Vkhutemas, and there had been significant cultural connection through the cross-fertilization of El Lissitzky. Russia had colossal plans for entire cities of worker housing, and an eye on acquiring German expertise. Ernst May, Stam, and Sch√ºtte-Lihotzky moved there in 1930 to design New Towns like Magnitogorsk, with Hannes Meyer's so-called 'Bauhaus Brigade' and Bruno Taut soon to follow. But the Russian experiment was over almost before it started. Working conditions proved hopeless, supplies impossible to get, and the labor unskilled and uninterested. Stalin's acceptance of the \\"retrograde\\" Palace of Soviets entry in the February 1932 competition provoked a strong reaction from the international modernist community, particularly Le Corbusier. The modernists had just lost their biggest client. Internal Russian politics led to vicious in-fighting among Russian architects' unions, and an equally vicious campaign against foreign 'specialists'. Some designers did not survive the experience. Others would leave Germany for Japan, or for the sizable German-exile community in Istanbul. Major architects in the modernist community ended up as far afield as Kenya, Mexico, and Sweden. Adolf Rading's Mohren Pharmacy in Wroc≈Çaw Others left for the Isokon Project and other projects in England, then eventually to the United States, where Gropius, Breuer and Berlin city planner Martin Wagner would educate a generation of students at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. More popularly, in the United States, the publication of Philip Johnson and Henry-Russell Hitchcock's groundbreaking International Style MOMA exhibition and book of 1932 established an official \\"canon\\" of the style, with an emphasis on Mies, Gropius, and Le Corbusier. Attention to these three came as the expense of the Social Democratic context of Neues Bauen, and the architectural logic of state-sponsored mass-produced dwellings. Johnson and Hitchcock derided 'fanatical functionalists' like Hannes Meyer for building for \\"some proletarian superman of the future\\". Although stripped of its social meaning and intellectual rigor on import to the USA, the New Objectivity would nevertheless be enormously influential on the postwar development of Modern architecture worldwide. Characterization of New Objectivity as an architectural style to begin with would have provoked strong disagreement from its practitioners. In the words of Gropius, they believed that buildings should be \\"shaped by internal laws without lies and games,\\" and that the practice of building would transcend the use of ornament and any stylistic categorization. In German the phrase Neues Bauen, dating from a 1919 book by Erwin Gutkind, captures this idea, because Bauen connotes 'construction' as opposed to 'architecture'.Gutkind built e.g. the residential complex of Neu- Jerusalem (Berlin) in forms of the New Objectivity.

The fruit is a pod 15‚Äì30 cm long and 2.5-5.0 cm broad, containing six to twelve seeds.Ali (1973) In the West Indies and certain parts of South America this tree is known as a 'Shak Shak Tree' because of the sound the seeds make in the pod. In Tamil Nadu , the tree is known as 'vaagai' as the ancient kings of the Sangam Age had worn the garland made by this flower whenever they win battles .

George Bentham placed the species in its present genus, but other authors believed that the plant described by Linnaeus was the related Albizia kalkora as described by Prain (based on the Mimosa kalkora of William Roxburgh), and erroneously referred to this species as Albizia lebbeck. However, Francisco Manuel Blanco used Mimosa lebbeck to refer to Albizia retusa ssp. retusa. In addition, the specific epithet is occasionally misspelled lebbek.USDA (1994), ILDIS (2005) Junior synonyms are: * Acacia lebbeck (L.) Willd. * Acacia macrophylla Bunge * Acacia speciosa (Jacq.) Willd. * Albizia latifolia B.Boivin * Albizia lebbeck (L.) Benth. var. leucoxylon Hassk. * Albizia lebbeck (L.) Benth. var. pubescens Haines * Albizia lebbeck (L.)

(orth.var.) * Mimosa sirissa Roxb. * Mimosa speciosa Jacq. :Mimosa speciosa Thunb. is Albizia julibrissin. * Pithecellobium splitgerberianum Miq. There also exists a genus named Lebeckia, in reference to the lebbeck. It is not closely related to A. lebeck however, but a member of the Faboideae, a different legume subfamily.

He held various offices before being installed as Worshipful Master of Lodge No. 26 in Dublin on 24 June 1746. He moved to London in 1748, possibly working as a journeyman painter, and possibly with a view to expanding his father's business. He would later work as a wine merchant, like his father. He was married to Elizabeth Dermott but his will does not list any children. He lived in Aldgate, Mile End and Stepney. He served as Grand Secretary of the Ancient Grand Lodge of England from 1752 to 1771. He wrote and published the Book of Constitutions of this Grand Lodge for the Ancient Grand Lodge of England, which he titled the Ahiman Rezon. Above all, it was Dermott's drive and tenacity that is credited with turning an association of six London lodges in 1751 into a viable and successful Grand Lodge, with lodges throughout England and the colonies. Early life Laurence Dermott was born sometime during 1720, the son of a successful merchant, Thomas Dermott. Thomas and his brother Anthony traded in a variety of goods, and were also wine merchants and ship owners. Although the family traded from Dublin, Laurence was probably born in the family home near Strokestown, County Roscommon. He was initiated into Freemasonry on 14 January 1740-41, according to official records. (New Year still occurred on 25 March, and this method of writing the year was employed to disambiguate the period between 1 January and 24 March.) He became Master of Lodge 26 in Dublin in 1746. His early initiation may indicate that he was following a family tradition by becoming a Freemason. Also in 1746, he became a Royal Arch mason, which would later significantly affect English Freemasonry. He moved to London in 1748, most histories giving his occupation as \\"Journeyman Painter\\". Given that he was later a successful wine merchant, he may have moved to England on family business.MacDermot Roe Family Genealogical Site Ken MacDermotRoe, Freemasonry and the MacDermots, 2012, retrieved 5 October 2012 Dermott and Grand Lodge Dermott joined a lodge affiliated to the Premier Grand Lodge of England (the Moderns) on his arrival in London, but he quickly found a home in one of the unaffiliated Irish lodges. His arrival in the history of masonry occurred on 5 February 1752, at the Griffin, a tavern in Holborn, when the Grand Committee of the new Grand Lodge elected him as their second Grand Secretary.Intercol Site Yasha Beresinger, Laurence Dermott: Extraordinary Man and Mason, 16 January 2012, retrieved 6 October 2012 At the next meeting, it was Dermott who examined the \\"Leg of Mutton Masons\\", Thomas Phealon and John Mackey. He found that they initiated Freemasons for the price of a leg of mutton, pretended to teach the secrets of the Royal Arch (which they evidently thought was a rainbow), and claimed to teach a masonic ritual for making men invisible. On 1 April, he succeeded in persuading the committee to replace the bye-laws written by the first secretary, John Morgan, with the bye-laws of his own lodge in Dublin.Witham Matthew Bywater, Notes on Laurence Dermott G.S. and his Work, London, 1884. n.b. Most of this book is composed from quotes from Grand Lodge minutes. The \\"historical\\" narrative is based on Preston, and therefore unreliable and not used. In 1756, Dermott finally printed the constitutions of the new Grand Lodge, entitled Ahiman Rezon. He probably finished them two years earlier, but delayed publication until the society should find a noble patron to act as Grand Master. After several false starts, the Earl of Blessington agreed to undertake the role, and the volume was then dedicated to him. The constitutions themselves were based on, if not copied from, Spratt's Irish Constitutions, which in turn were based on Anderson's Constitutions, written for the Moderns some three decades earlier. Like Anderson's book, a section of songs was appended, many written by Dermott himself. At the beginning, in place of Anderson's incredible history of the craft, is a humorous account of his own attempt to write a better one, the vision that halted him, and the puppy that ate the manuscript. There is also an explanation of the difference between his own Grand Lodge and the earlier Grand Lodge of England, or \\"the Moderns\\", a name which was coined before Dermott, and sticks to them up to present day. In the following three editions published during Dermott's lifetime, there is a reasoned argument that a man contemplating becoming a Freemason should not join the Moderns, because the changes in their ritual meant that he could not be recognised in any other jurisdiction. There is also an increasing amount of sarcasm, parody, and outright scorn directed at the Moderns, whose greatest masonic symbols are the knife and fork. This was gradually edited out in the editions published after his death. The book sold well, and raised the profile of the new Grand Lodge, enabling it to become a truly national phenomenon, warranting lodges abroad and in the Army.Association of Atholl Lodges , Ray Sheppard, Ahiman Rezon, retrieved 8 July 2012Google books, Laurence Dermott, Ahiman Rezon (pdf) retrieved 30 June 2012 A curious entry in the minutes of July 1753 reads, \\"The Grand Secretary humbly begged that the lodge would please to appoint some certain person to deliver the summons's for the future, that he the said secretary was under the necessity of delivering or paying for delivery for some months past, as he was obliged to work twelve hours in the day for the Master Painter who employed him.\\" Gould, in his history of Freemasonry, took this as evidence of poverty. The \\"Master Painter\\" may have been James Hagarty, who presided over the lodge meeting that employed Dermott as Grand Secretary.Gould's History of Freemasonry Vol 2 (1933 edition) retrieved 7 October 2012 The Grand Tyler and the Grand Pursuivant were accordingly saddled with the summonses. In October, Dermott was delegated to \\"attend and regulate all processions, and at Funerals take particular care that all persons walk in proper rotation\\". He made no objection to this charge on his time. Dermott remained Grand Secretary until 1771, at which time he was made Deputy Grand Master. As the Grand Master was at the time little more than a figurehead, it was Dermott who presided at meetings, and effectively ruled Grand Lodge. At the end of his tenure as secretary, he had been absent on several occasions due to being laid low with gout. His last appearance in lodge was in 1789, evidently in failing health. He died in 1791. The location of his grave is unknown. Legacy Laurence Dermott had a strong, pugnacious presence that made him many enemies. On one occasion he had to defend himself in Grand Lodge from a charge of not being a regularly initiated Freemason. (His accuser was expelled.) He was also an accomplished writer, orator, and teacher of masonry, as well as being the administrator who is credited with preserving and leading the Ancients through most of their history as an independent Grand Lodge. It is thanks to him that the United Grand Lodge, as it currently stands, inherits the infrastructure of the Moderns, but takes its ritual from the Ancients.Pietre Stones H. L.

In common law jurisdictions, assessors are usually non-lawyers who sit together with a judge to provide either expert advice (such as on maritime matters) or guidance on local practices. The use of assessors nowadays is quite rare. In some jurisdictions, such as Fiji, assessors are used in place of juries. An assessor's opinion or view of a case is not binding on a judge. The term \\"assessor\\" is also very generally applied to persons appointed to ascertain and fix the value of rates and taxes, and in this sense the word is used in the United States (see Assessor (property)).

This is usually done by an office called the assessor or tax assessor. Governments need to collect taxes in order to function. Federal, state and local governments impose tax assessments against real property, personal property and income. The word tax assessment is used in different ways but often refers to a tax liability owed by a taxpayer. In the case of property, a tax assessment is an evaluation or an estimate of value that is typically performed by a tax assessor. The assessment leads to an ‚Äúassessed value,‚Äù which is a base number used in the calculation of the property tax. There is a relationship between the assessed value and the tax liability. The higher the assessment, the higher the tax bill. In some jurisdictions, the assessed value is meant to equal the market value of property. In other areas, the market value is multiplied by an assessment ratio to arrive at the assessed value. Once a tax assessor determines the assessed value, it is multiplied by a tax rate, called a ‚Äúmill rate,‚Äù to arrive at the amount of the property tax. Most state statutes give taxpayers a right to appeal the assessed value concluded by the assessor. An initial step in the appeal process is for the taxpayer to make an independent estimate of market value and to compare it against the assessed value.https://apartmentpropertyvaluation.com/apartment-property-tax- appeals United States Jeff Davis County Board of Assessors' vehicle In local government in the United States, an assessor, also called a tax assessor, is an appointed or elected official charged with determining the value of each taxable property in a county, municipality, or township; this information is then used by the local governments to determine the necessary rates of taxation to support the community's annual public budgets.

The Western Rifle Division () was formed during the Russian Civil War,M. K. Dziewanowski, The Foundation of the Communist Party of Poland, American Slavic and East European Review, Vol. 11, No. 2.

It was reduced to a brigade and disbanded after the end of the Russian Civil War in 1921. The first formation of the 52nd during the existence of the Soviet Union occurred during the interwar period in 1935. After the first formation of the division was promoted to Guards status as the 10th Guards Rifle Division during World War II in late December 1941, a second formation of the division fought on for the duration in several Fronts. The second formation was disbanded in 1946 after the end of the war. A third formation of the division was formed by renumbering the 315th Rifle Division in 1955 during the Cold War, becoming a motor rifle division in 1957.  Russian Civil War  The Western Division was formed in August 1918 in the area of Moscow and Tambov at the initiative of Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL) and the Polish Socialist Party-Left (PPS-Lewica), part of the Moscow Military District. A Polish communist regiment, the Red Regiment of Revolutionary Warsaw (Czerwony Pu≈Çk Rewolucyjnej Warszawy) made up its cadre, and in the beginning it was mostly composed of Polish volunteers. According to its order of battle (below) each of its brigades consisted of two battalions of infantry and one battalion of cavalry. During the Polish-Soviet War it was part of the Western Army from November of that year, and it fought against the Lithuanian and Belarusian Self-Defence units and later the Polish Army of the newly created Second Polish Republic in the opening phase of the Polish-Soviet War. Spearheading the Russian westward offensive of 1918-1919 ('Target Vistula') it took Wilno in January 1919; it sustained heavy losses during the fights at Baranowicze against forces of Gen. Stanis≈Çaw Szeptycki (part of Operation Wilno, a Polish counteroffensive). Following these losses, in June 1919 the division was heavily reinforced with Russians, Belarusians and Ukrainians and lost its Polish character; it was then (9 June) renamed as 52nd Rifle Division of the Red Army. Commanders of the division were commissars Stanis≈Çaw Bobi≈Ñski and Stefan ≈ªbikowski. Between March and July, the division fought against Polish troops in the area of Minsk and Molodechno. In August it fought in the direction of Baranovichi, then in the area of Borisov and Berezino in September and October, and in the area of Lepel in November. In November, the 52nd was transferred south to join the 14th Army, fighting against the Armed Forces of South Russia on the Southern Front. The division transferred to the 8th Army in December, to the 9th Army in February 1920, and to the 13th Army in April. It fought against Pyotr Wrangel's White Army in Crimea, advancing towards Melitopol between May and July. In August and September the 52nd fought in the defense of the Kakhovka bridgehead. In September it was transferred to the 6th Army, fighting in the Northern Taurida operation of the Southern Front in October and November. During the operation, the 52nd fought in the area of Agayman and Nyzhni Sirohozy, and was temporarily directly subordinated to the front command in November. Between 7 and 17 November, the division fought in the Perekop‚ÄìChongar operation, crossing the Sivash and helping to capture the Ishun fortified position. The operation concluded with the final defeat and evacuation of the White Army in Crimea. In December, the 52nd protected the Black Sea coast in the estuaries of the Dnieper and Bug. On 13 December it received the honorific Yekaterinburg. In early 1921, the division participated in the suppression of anarchist leader Nestor Makhno's Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine in the Nikolayev area. In accordance with orders of the Kharkov Military District of 23 April and 11 June and a 6th Army order of 29 April, the 52nd was reorganized as the 52nd Separate Rifle Brigade, directly subordinated to the district headquarters. It was soon renumbered as the 136th and by a district order of 12 October was used to form the 1st Brigade of the 25th Rifle Division.  1st formation  In accordance with a Moscow Military District directive of 11 April 1935, the division was formed at Yaroslavl from a cadre provided by the 18th Rifle Division. It was part of the Moscow Military District until 1936, when it relocated to the Belorussian Military District. The 52nd Rifle Division took part in the invasion of Poland in 1939 and the Winter War with FinlandPoirer and Connor, Red Army Order of Battle from November 1939 to March 1940. It became part of the Leningrad Military District for the latter. At the outbreak of the German invasion in 1941, the 52nd was in the far north, near Murmansk. On 25 June, the 158th and 112th Regiments were transferred by sea to the 14th Rifle Division. Due to its skill in defending the vital port of Murmansk the 52nd Rifle Division became one of the first and few formations raised to Guards status in the Arctic, as the 10th Guards Rifle Division on Dec. 26. The division remained in that region until late 1944, when it was transferred to 2nd Belorussian Front and took part in the invasion of Germany.Charles C. Sharp, Red Guards: Soviet Guards Rifle and Airborne Units 1941 to 1945, Nafziger, 1995, p 46  2nd Formation  A new 52nd Rifle Division formed on Mar. 1, 1942 at Kolomna in the Moscow Military District. The division was completed in about three months. It arrived at the front in late July 1942, as part of 30th Army, in Kalinin Front, just in time to participate in the First Rzhev‚ÄìSychyovka Offensive Operation. The 52nd, along with the rest of 30th Army, was transferred to Western Front in August.Charles C. Sharp, Red Swarm, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, Nafziger, 1996, p 19 The division was quickly worn down in these battles of attrition very near the town of Rzhev but, along with the 2nd and 16th Guards Rifle Divisions, was able to liberate the key village of Polunino and advance 6 km to the outskirts of the town during the following months.Petr Mikhin, Guns Against the Reich, Pen & Sword Books Ltd., Barnsley, UK, 2010, pp 47-48 After rebuilding, on the last day of 1942 the 52nd began moving south to Southwestern Front.Mikhin, p 48 It took part in the Soviet offensive towards Kharkov in early 1943, serving at various times in the 1st Guards Army, the Popov Mobile Group, and the 3rd Tank Army. This effort did not go well for the division, as it was assaulted and partially overrun by German forces. By the end of the winter the 52nd was in 57th Army, the former 3rd Tank Army, where it remained with few exceptions until the end of 1944. From March to July the division was dug in along the line of the Donets River.Mikhin, p 66 In August 1943, the division moved with 57th Army to Steppe Front, coming under command of Col. A.Ia.

The 52nd entered and helped expand the Soviet Kremenchug-Dnepropetrovsk bridgehead across the Dnepr River before digging in along the Ingulets River for the winter. Along with its 57th Army, the division was moved to 3rd Ukrainian Front in February 1944, and took part in the successful early stages of the spring offensive to the Dniestr River,Mikhin, p 100 before being halted in the First Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive. In August a new offensive was launched, and the 52nd played a role in the destruction of the German and Romanian forces in this southern sector. After the capture of Belgrade on Oct. 20, due to losses the division again went into reserves in the town of Ruma, rebuilding to a strength of 6,000 men by the end of December.Mikhin, p 162 The division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner in recognition of its \\"courage and valor\\" in the capture of Belgrade on 14 November. In January 1945, 52nd was transferred to 4th Guards Army, and later that same month to 46th Army, which was shifted to 2nd Ukrainian Front in March.Sharp, Red Swarm, p 20. In April the division was given part of the credit for the capture of Vienna and got that city's name as an honorific. On 1 May 1945 the division was with 18th Guards Rifle Corps, 53rd Army, in 2nd Ukrainian Front, alongside 109th Guards Rifle Division and 317th Rifle Division.BSSA via tashv.nm.ru It ended the war with Germany fighting near Prague.Mikhin, p 208 Along with its Army, the division was railed across Siberia to take part in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria.

It stars Victoria Abril, Imanol Arias and Antonio Valero. The film is a psychological thriller. A middle class woman torn between her love for her spouse and her ill ex-husband, both of them were her childhood friends. Intruso received five nominations to the Goya Awards in 1994 including Best Picture. Plot Luisa, a middle class housewife living in Santander, Northern Spain, has a comfortable existence with her husband Ramiro, who has a successful medico-dental career. They have two children: Ramir√≠n and √Ångela. One winter day, Luisa, stopping in a traffic light, spots her ex-husband, √Ångel, who is selling tissues on the streets. After that brief encounter, the next day, Luisa looks for √Ångel in the area where she saw him before. She finds him wandering about the city in destitution. Overcome with sentimentality and, over Ramiro's objections, Luisa takes √Ångel into her home in an effort to help him and rebuild the friendship the three of them once had. Luisa is convinced that destiny has reunited them. Luisa, √Ångel and Ramiro were three inseparable friends in their childhood and youth. Once they became adults, they formed an uneasy love triangle in which the two men were rivals for Luisa's affection. Luisa married √Ångel, but two years later, she left him to marry Ramiro, who she thought was the one she was mean to be with. Ramiro is not pleased to see again his former friend who by now he wishfully presumed to be dead. Unwillingly, he accepts √Ångel's presence. He thought √Ångel was working in construction living a prosperous life in South America. However, after his divorce from Luisa's, √Ångel spent all his money in a restless life. He reappears after more than ten years of absence, broke and ill. √Ångel still loves Luisa and has never overcome his feelings of resentment about their divorce. He still wears the ring she gave him in their first and only wedding anniversary. The ring has the inscription: P.R.E.O.M. that stands for: To be reunited in the other world (). Initially overwhelmed by Luisa's mystical and deranged streak, √Ångel tries to leave but √Ångela brings him back home. He has fits, foaming, and blood in the mouth. Medical results show that he is terminally ill. Soon, Ramiro and √Ångel shift from friends to enemies and have a bitter confrontation. Luisa is torn between them. She loves √Ångel as a part of herself, but also loves her husband and beyond reason, wants to have them both. √Ångel establishes a friendship with the couple's little children, Ramirin and √Ångela. The girl is more sympathetic and the boy, always taking his father side, is a little hostile. √Ångel spellbinds them both with his offbeat stories and his directness. He takes them to a short trip to the beach where he reenacts with them a scene from his own childhood. He sees in the children the reflection of his own youth and his erstwhile friendship with Luisa and Ramiro. While √Ångel is at the beach, Ramiro and Luisa find out that √Ångel is terminally ill and has very little time to live. Ramiro hopes he can wait out √Ångel's declining health, while Luisa does not accept the medical verdict. As √Ångel's health worsens, Luisa insists upon caring for him in the house rather than sending him off to a hospital. He is soon bedridden and in constant pain. Luisa makes love to him, and when she returns to Ramiro in their bedroom, she has sex with her husband. She loves them both intensely and equally. When √Ångel condition worsens, he falls into coma, Luisa, alone through force of will brings him back to life to the astonishment of her husband and children. She takes √Ångel to bed, and in spite of his illness makes love to him. She does not deceive her husband, she tells him so right after. Ramiro takes the information with resignation knowing that the end is near for his rival. When √Ångel is at death's door, Ramiro prepares a lethal doze of anesthetic to accelerate his death. In the final moment, the dying man makes a final, desperate bid to steal his ex-wife away from her new spouse. He grasps the hypodermic needle with its overdose of anesthetic and kills Ramiro. Dragging himself to his rival's marital bed, √Ångel dies next to Luisa. Luisa then takes a ring with P.R.E.O.M. written on the inside from her dresser and puts it on the now dead Ramiro, to bring the two ex-friends and rivals together in the after life. Luisa and the children follow two funeral cars to the cemetery, both coffins have written: to be reunited in the other world. Production Intruso was originated with the international success of Amantes, a film, like Intruso, directed by Vicente Aranda, scripted by him with the collaboration of Alvaro del Amo and produced by Pedro Costa. Vicente Aranda was filming El Amante Biling√ºe when Pedro Costa proposed him to make what would become Intruso. Aranda was still filming El Amante Biling√ºe but he started pre-production before finishing the previous film. Intruso began to be filmed just days, after the conclusion of El Amante Biling√ºe. Both films appeared in 1993. El Amante Biling√ºe opened in theaters in April 1994 and Intruso six months later. Cast After teaming in Amantes, director Vicente Aranda and star, Victoria Abril reunited again in Intruso, their ninth collaboration. Imanol Arias plays the role of √Ångel, a man who has seen his life destroyed by those who now are giving him shelter. He becomes the catalyst of the conflicting love triangle in which their encounter derives. Imanol Arias had worked with Vicente Aranda before in El Lute, a film that was an artistic and commercial success. He was also the star of Aranda's previous film El Amante Biling√ºe. The role of the husband, after being declined by other actors, fell on Antonio Valero, who had worked with Vicente Aranda and Imanol Arias in El Lute. Na√≠m Thomas, who played √Ångel as a child, has had a successful acting and singing career in Spain. *Imanol Arias as √Ångel *Victoria Abril as Luisa * Antonio Valero as Ramiro * Alicia Rozas as √Ångela * Carlos Moreno as Ramir√≠n * Rebeca Roizo as Luisa as a child * Na√≠m Thomas as √Ångel as a child * Alejandro S√°nchez as Ramiro as a child * Alicia Agut as Juliana Themes One of the main themes of Intruso is the destructive potential of obsessive passion and its links with death and sex. Intruso forms with Amantes (1991) and Celos (1999) a trilogy of films about love as uncontrollable passion that ends tragically. These three films directed by Vicente Aranda are loosely based in real crime stories. Analysis Intruso concern an impossible love triangle that ends in murder. Aranda's direction is concise, its style austere, unadorned and atoned with the claustrophobic and dark atmosphere of the film. Jose Luis Alcaine's cinematography is dark and cold. The camera has a fondness for darkened bedrooms intense two- shots winter light according to the dark plot line. Some elements of Intruso resemble Emily Bront√´'s novel Wuthering Heights. Luisa assertion that she loves √Ångel like a part of herself is similar to Catherine Earnshaw's close self-identification with Heathcliff in the novel. Luisa's love for √Ångel and Ramiro also resembles Catherine Earnshaw's split interest between Edgar Linton and Heathcliff. Luisa like Catherine has chosen the placid commodity of a quiet life with Edgar (Ramiro ) over the riskiest alternative of Heathcliff (√Ångel).The rivalry of the two former friends for Luisa's affection also resembles Edgar and Heathcliff dispute over Catherine. √Ångel as Heathcliff comes back after years of absence to disrupt the couple's life. Luisa's attitude to √Ångel's illness reflects Heathcliff's reaction to Catherine's death. Novel and film end in the graveyard. In once scene, √Ångel and Ramiro are in Ramiro's consulting room. The drama is heightened by strong white light from the windows. √Ångel tells him directly of his hatred for him, of the atrocious tortures he has imagined in the years of absence. Ramiro takes a step towards him and equally directly gives him his version of ‚Äú the painful truth ‚Äú, that Luisa made a mistake marrying √Ångel and corrected it by marrying Ramiro. The white light on his face heightens his chilly candor. The reverse shot shows √Ångel, now with tears and intensity on his face. The two men swap positions and √Ångel rage and desperation increases. Again, they are face to face closer now, than before. Violently √Ångel grasps Ramiro by the arms and to the words ‚Äú I still love her madly ‚Äú kisses him ferociously first in both cheeks and then with ambiguous intensity and eyes closed, kisses him on the lips. Underlying the pure vengeful intend. Ramiro is forced into being a momentary fantasy substitution for Luisa. There is another interpretation, that of a homoerotic undercurrent, from the intensity of the adolescent triangle. Ramiro's reaction is of a threat with his fits ‚Äú if you that again I‚Äôll punch you face in‚Äô The scene carries the classic violence of homosocial rivalry over into the arena of male rape, and yet it allows a violent tenderness, not between Angel and Ramiro now, but between √Ångel and what he has lost. √Ångel triumphant, vehement and sensuality charged confession to Ramiro on the way from the clinic on the day of the news, that he ahs slept Luisa again. Ramiro's‚Äô reaction is a mixture of misplaced loyalty. Emotional dysfunction and self-interest, all conformed with the codes of male friendship. Act as he does Ramiro's‚Äô attitude bring upon him and his family the tragic of the double murder, because neither he understand his wife of the situation. The mystical and sometimes deranged character of Luisa is formed of sheer emotion and feeling. In the most impressive scene of the films, Luisa revived the comatose √Ångel with sheer vital force, without any help, she drags him to the swimming pool, where she introduces his head in the water, which makes him react. At the same time that she has to carry a weight superior to her own and in front of her husband and children, who are witness of the miracle of √Ångel's resurrection. Luisa very riotously exhorts √Ångel to open his eyes and live in a monologue that is, a beautiful declaration of love.‚Äú Wake up, I order it to you. Repeat with me, I don‚Äôt wanna die, I don‚Äôt wanna die. Live for me, so I can tell you, I love you, I love you, a million times. Live, so you can look at yourself in my eyes, so you can feel the warmest of my hands in your forehead. Look at that (pointing out to the moon) she is there, more beautiful than ever, she reflects tomorrow's light. Don‚Äôt you wanna see the morning's sun? Open your eyes, tell your name aloud, I order you to yell your name (she slaps him and continues). Hold on; help me, fight for your life. It is inside of you what doesn‚Äôt let you live. Spit it out. You have to live for me (she lays him down on the edge of the swimming pool), I shouldn‚Äôt have left you. I want you to feel pain, pain, the pain of being alive (she submerges his head in the water until the dying man reacts, coughing) Tell your name, I‚Äôm Angel and I wanna live (he complies) \\"Wait for me, I‚Äôm Angel\\". Reception Intruso did not enjoy the commercial or critical success of Amantes.

Demographics According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, San Antonio spans an area of and has 87,205 inhabitants (42,843 men and 44,362 women). Of these, 83,435 (95.7%) lived in urban areas and 3,770 (4.3%) in rural areas. The population grew by 11.6% (9,047 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.  Governmental Administration  Partial view of the facade of the Illustrious Municipality of San Antonio. As a commune, San Antonio is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a communal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Omar Vera Castro, who is advised by six councilors: * Pedro Pi√±a Mateluna (PC) * Ram√≥n Silva Suazo (PDC) * Danilo Rojas Barahona (RN) * Fernando N√∫√±ez Michellod (PS) * Jose Martinez Fuentes (Ind., Concert of Parties for Democracy) * Omar Morales M√°rquez (PRSD) Within the electoral divisions of Chile, San Antonio is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Mrs. Mar√≠a Jos√© Hoffmann (UDI) and Mr. V√≠ctor Torres (PDC) as part of the 15th electoral district, (together with Santo Domingo, Cartagena, El Tabo, El Quisco, Algarrobo and Casablanca). The commune is represented in the Senate by Francisco Chahu√°n Chahu√°n (RN) and Ricardo Lagos Weber (PPD) as part of the 6th senatorial constituency (Valpara√≠so-Coast).  Tourism  The zone will give way to a tourist route that will have cuisine, with the emerging cuisine being based on shellfish and oenology. This initiative is supported by a program called The Seaboard Program of the Poets supported by CORFO, or in Spanish \\"el programa litoral de los Poetas de la CORFO.\\" The new route explains that it will unite the circuit to the local productions, chefs and wine vineyards, like the vineyards of Matetic, Casa Mar√≠n, Amayna, Lo Abarca, and Malvilla. Also, with the support from the Program of Tourism and Interests by CORFO, in the last year, wine growers, food industries, and tourism have initiated a process of trainings and associations under the concept of a good cuisine being the local identity. = Tourist Attractions = On the seaside of the city of San Antonio there is a walk called ‚Äúel Paseo Bellamar‚Äù (the beautiful sea walk), a mall called ‚ÄúMall Arauco San Antonio‚Äù, and a casino called ‚Äúel Casino del Pac√≠fico‚Äù (the casino of the Pacific), where you can see the merchant ships, and the activities of fishermen and the port workers. From here and in the cove called ‚Äúla caleta Pintor Pacheco Altamarino‚Äù (the cove of the painter Pacheco Altamarino), tours are offered in boats through the bay of the port and in the San Antonio fishing market fish and shellfish are sold. There is also a national monument called ‚ÄúGr√∫a 82‚Äù where it is possible to observe seals in the rock piles of the sector. Another attraction is the Municipal Museum of Natural Sciences and Archaeology of San Antonio, with its collections principally dedicated to the natives that lived in the zone of the central sea of Chile, and the wildlife in the area. This museum contains huge skeletons of sea mammals, among those is the blue whale, a garden with natural species, aquariums, and the rescue and rehabilitation center of wild fauna. Another important attraction is the panoramic viewpoint on the hill of Cristo del Maipo (Christ of Maipo), the hill of Centinela, and the viewpoint of the 21st of May. In the sector of Llolleo, you can find the parade ground, also known as ‚ÄúLa Plaza del Folclor‚Äù (The Plaza of Folklore), and the hill viewpoint of ‚ÄúCristo del Maipo‚Äù (Christ of Maipo). The handcrafting town of Lo Gallardo, is also an important attraction; the river Maipo, with an impressive river mouth that starts at fisherman's cove; the Leyda reservoir with abundant aquatic birds; and the small village of Cuncum√©n, a typical Chilean country town on the side of the Maipo river.

The formation of the Ancient Grand Lodge brought together lodges and Masons who, believing themselves to be part of an older, original Masonic tradition, had chosen not to ally themselves with the previously formed Moderns Grand Lodge of 1717. The title Ahiman Rezon has been often said to be of the Hebrew language and variously mean \\"to help a brother\\", \\"will of selected brethren\\", \\"The secrets of prepared brethren\\", \\"Royal Builders\\" and \\"Brother Secretary\\". Upon more inspection however the words Ahiman and Rezon are two Biblical figures. Ahiman1 Chronicles 9:17 was one of four Levite gatekeepers appointed by King David, the others being Shallum, Akkub, and Talmon who guarded the Holy of Holies. Rezon,1 Kings 11:23-25 a fallen prince, eventually came to lead a group of Marauders to seize Syria where he became king and was constantly entangled in feuds against King Solomon. The reason why Laurence Dermott used it, and what it meant to him, remains a mystery however some have speculated that Dermott chose these names to show exactly how the Ancient Freemasons felt in relation to the Modern Freemasons. Ancients sought to retain a purist form of Freemasonry, which they viewed as being holy. The Modernist sought to change Masonry, and were in the process removing the old ways entirely. Dermott saw the Ancients akin to Ahiman, guarding the Holiest of Holies-Masonry, and likewise to Rezon as his movement (the Ancient Freemasons) were rivaling the Modernist movement, much like Rezon's rivalry with King Solomon who had become unclean in the eyes of the Lord. The Ahiman Rezon prepared by Smith in 1781, and used by Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, as well as Daicho's edition of 1807, used by the Grand Lodge of Ancient York Masons of South Carolina, are both based on the original text written by Laurence Dermott, which was first published in A.D. 1756 or the year of Masonry A.L. 5756. History The first edition of the Ahiman Rezon was published in 1756, a second one in 1764. By the time the Ancients and Moderns united in 1813, eight editions had been published. The original edition, written by Laurence Dermott, Grand Secretary of the Ancient Grand Lodge, contains a parody of the histories of Freemasonry such as that in Anderson's 'Constitutions', in which Dermott resolves to write a history of the Craft by purchasing all the previous histories and then throwing them 'under the table'. He then describes a fabled meeting with four 'sojourners from Jerusalem' who were present at the building of Solomon's temple, making them at least two thousand years old, whose 'memories' were possibly failing them. This satire continues the tradition of the Scald Miserable Masons who staged mock processions and disrupted the Grand Lodge's annual procession. Dermott's political purpose in writing the Ahiman Rezon is revealed in his short history of famous leaders of the ancient world who were of 'mean extraction, that is poor, such as Tamerlane the son of a herdsman, and on the cover which shows the arms of the Worshipful Company of Masons as well as those of the Freemasons, possibly in an attempt to re-connect Freemasonry to its operative and artisan roots. The Grand Lodges of Pennsylvania and South Carolina are the only two jurisdictions in the U.S. that continue to call their Constitution by this name. In Section 12 of the Pennsylvania Ahiman Rezon, under Historical Notes, it states the following: :The first Book of Masonic law published by the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania was entitled: \\"Ahiman Rezon abridged and digested\\" as a help to all that are or would be Free and Accepted Masons.\\" It was prepared by the Grand Secretary, Rev. Brother William Smith, D.D., Provost of the University of Pennsylvania, and was almost entirely a reprint of Dermott‚Äôs work; it was approved by the Grand Lodge 22 November 1781, published in 1783, and dedicated to Brother George Washington. Ahiman Rezon of 1764 \\"C H A R G E I. :Concerning GOD and Religion :A MASON is obliged by his tenure to observe the moral law as a true Noachida*; and if he rightly understands the craft, he will never be a stupid atheist nor an irreligious libertine, nor act against conscience. :In antient times, the christian masons were charged to comply with the christian usages of each country where they traveled or worked ; being found in all nations, even of divers religions. :They are generally charged to adhere to that religion in which all men agree (leaving each brother to his own particular opinion; ) that is, to be good men and true, men of honour and honesty, by whatever names, religions, or persuasions they may be distinguished ; for they all agree in the three great articles of Noah, enough to preserve the cement of the lodge. :Thus masonry is the center of their union, and the happy means of conciliating persons that otherwise must have remained at a perpetual distance. :*Sons of Noah, the first name of Free-Masons.\\" Google Books: Laurence Dermott, Ahiman Rezon 1764 (retrieved 29 July 2012) See also * Anderson's Constitutions * Masonic Manuscripts References Category:1751 books Category:1764 books Category:Masonic books ","title":"Ahiman Rezon"},{"id":"10556572","text":"Mousampur is a small village in Alwar district of Rajasthan, a state in northern India.

Katy is the sister of Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas), and has been central to several storylines, prominently Clare Cunningham's (Gemma Bissix) revenge. In July 2016, after Warren returned to the village, he revealed that Katy had died from a drug overdose, and feels immensely guilty as he was in prison at the time of her death. Later, revealed on 1 February 2017 that her nephew Joel Dexter (Rory Douglas-Speed) and Bart McQueen (Jonny Clarke) supplied her with the drugs, leading to her death. Character creation and casting Katy was created by Bryan Kirkwood as a sister for existing character Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas). Hannah Tointon was cast in the role, but she quit after one year to try other parts. Of her departure Tointon stated: \\"It's been brilliant and it's been a really difficult decision to leave. I always said that I'd only do a year and I feel that now is the right time to leave and try something new.\\" The character was killed off-screen to facilitate a storyline involving Warren which aired in 2016.  Storylines  Katy was first mentioned by her older brother, Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas), whilst having a conversation with Justin Burton (Chris Fountain). He said that she and Louise Summers (Roxanne McKee) were his only weaknesses. Katy made her first appearance on 30 April 2007. Justin took a liking to Katy as soon as she entered the village but soon changed his mind after finding out she was Warren's sister. Katy received ¬£1,000 from brother Warren as a bribe to move back to America, but she refused to leave and took the money anyway. Katy fancied Justin but he told her to stop \\"hassling him\\", so she left him alone. However, she wasn't yet aware of why he was so scared of her brother Warren. Katy has begun working for her brother Warren at The Loft, but he got angry when a customer tried it on with her. Warren punched the customer and told him he would 'kill him if he tried it on with his little sister again'. She found out the truth about Justin and Warrens treatment of Justins ex-girlfriend Becca Dean (Ali Bastian) through Louise. Although she was disgusted by his behaviour, after listening to his side of the story, the pair reconciled. Shortly after, Katy travelled to London to see some old friends, but not before sleeping with Justin, who told her he loved her. She replied in kind, then the two swapped treasured possessions, Justin giving her the only thing his sister Mel had left when she died, a friendship bracelet, and she gave him a bracelet her parents had given her. Once Katy returned to Hollyoaks, Clare Cunningham (Gemma Bissix) informed Warren that Justin and Katy were sleeping together. This resulted in Justin taking a beating from Warren after catching them in bed, leading to the police stepping in and arresting Warren, after being tipped off by Clare. Katy recently found out that Warren murdered Sean; this resulted in her and Justin running away together, until Justin found out that Katy had left Mel's bracelet back at the flat. Justin said he had to go back and get it, as it was the only thing he has left. He eventually found her bracelet and ran back to Katy, forgetting his mobile. When Warren found his mobile he read the texts by Katy and discovered that her and Justin were planning on running away together; this resulted in him running Justin over with a van, leading to an ear-piercing scream from a devastated Katy. Justin ended up in the hospital with broken legs. Warren revealed in later episodes that Katy and himself had been fostered as children. They loved their foster brother Sperncer dearly but his mother treated them abusively. She would lock Warren outside or in cupboards for days and would physically abuse Katy. When Warren tried to help Katy, he was thrown out; Katy soon followed him. She then began working in Louise's salon after Warren stated that he did not want blokes 'perving' at her. Katy was still not aware of Warren's anger, or that he is capable of murder. After returning to the flat she found Louise passed out on the sofa surrounded by empty bottles and Louise informed her of Warren's arrest for Clare's attempted murder. Katy went to visit her brother in prison but he failed to convince her that he wasn't behind the attack and she left telling him that she didn't know who he was anymore, because of the person he had become. After Warren's release from prison she decided to enroll at Hollyoaks Community College instead of going away to university in London, as this would allow her to spend more time with her boyfriend and brother. After Clare leaving Hollyoaks, Warren decided to have a party, and Katy went back to the flat to change, to find someone already there. This person kidnapped Katy. Later, Warren, along with Justin and Max Cunningham (Matt Littler), tried to find her. It was revealed that Clare took Katy, tied her up and gagged her. The reason Clare kidnapped Katy is because Katy's boyfriend Justin pushed Clare from The Loft balcony and Clare wants revenge, so she uses Katy as bait in a trap to kill Justin. Clare tells Warren that he must kill Justin to see Katy alive again with Clare saying she will kill Katy if Warren does not kill Justin. Clare tells Warren, Justin and Max to meet her and Katy at the docks where Clare can identify Justin's dead body. Clare then turns up in her bright red sports car with Katy by her side still tied up and gagged. Clare then discovers that she has been tricked and Justin is still alive and faking his death so that they can get Katy back. Warren, Justin and Max tried to persuade her to return Katy, but Clare was so angry that she had been tricked that she bundled Katy into her car and drove off. A dramatic and dangerous high speed car chase ensued, but Clare's car went out of control and Katy and Clare plunged into the water below a very tall quarry. Katy started struggling underwater and began to drown but was saved by Warren & Justin while Clare was presumed to have drowned and died. Katy is left shaken by the kidnapping, not speaking to people for days after it happened. She was shown to be frightened in her sleep and even after a visit from Max who begged her not to let Clare ruin another life, it took her time to recover. Warren later reassured Max, who was struggling to cope with his own feelings of guilt and remorse over the incident, that he and Katy had no problems with him and they both recognised that Max was not to blame for any of Clare's actions. But Katy felt she was no longer able to trust Justin after the events of the kidnapping and also because he let Warren take the fall for his crime, resulting in her telling him things were over between them when he tried getting her to talk to him by setting up a romantic meal. However she does admit to still have feelings for him. Katy applied to study Law at Hollyoaks Community College, but was shocked to discover her name was not on the class register. The enrollment office had made a mistake and claimed the course was full. Katy was very distressed by this and called on Warren for help who tried talking to the enrollment officer, but it did no good. Eventually Katy was able to secure her place on the course with the help of Louise who threatened to tell the enrollment officer's boss about his inappropriate activities on the job. Katy's first day didn't go according to plan. She was late when she couldn't find one of her books and then walked into John Paul McQueen (James Sutton), spilling water all over herself. When John Paul tried to help her dry herself she accused him of trying to feel her up. Later Warren properly introduced the two and explained that John Paul was gay. The two developed a quick friendship, mocking the people in the SU bar. Katy later agreed to go to the Freshers Ball with John Paul. Justin also went to the Freshers Ball with Danny in an attempt to win back Katy. At first, Katy was uninterested but later agreed to listen to Justin. However, after returning from the toilet she walked in on Justin attempting to break up one of the numerous fights that had broken out, this one between John Paul and Nancy. Assuming Justin had picked a fight with John Paul, Katy again dismissed Justin and left with John Paul. Katy had another brush with death when she decided to attend John Paul's house warming and Kris Fisher's (Gerard McCarthy) welcome back party, and ended up being one of the many people who became unconscious due to carbon monoxide poisoning. This was due to Jessica Harris getting the boiler fixed on the cheap by Danny Valentine. She was saved by her ex-boyfriend Justin, who called an ambulance before taking all the unconscious bodies out of the room with help from Danny. During her stay in hospital, Katy decides to get back together with Justin saying that she still loves Justin and he is going to stay with her in hospital. When Justin told Katy he was going to help Nancy fight for custody of Charlie, she talked him out of it telling him that the court would bring up everything that happened between him and Becca. After a secret visit to Charlie in hospital, Justin told her that he was sorry and that he loved her and things would soon be back to normal between them. However, he has now joined with Nancy to fight for custody of Charlie, which Katy does not yet know about. Katy has been getting closer to housemate Zak Ramsey over the past few weeks after Justin becoming more distant and more involved over Charlie. In an episode on Friday 22 February 2008 Zak and Katy had a shopping trolley race and had much fun, afterwards they kissed. Zak however was left heartbroken when he saw Justin and Katy making up, meaning Katy had chosen Justin over him. However, as Justin is getting closer to Nancy and more and more distant to Katy, Katy confides in Zak. They end up passionately kissing in The Loft and she eventually chooses Zak over Justin. On Tuesday 18 March 2008 Katy and Zak had sex and Katy said to Zak that her and Justin were over although on 19 March as she goes to tell Justin its over she finds he has cooked a meal so they can spend some quality time together and she fails to tell him it is over whilst Zak waits for her return. On Friday 4 April 2008 Louise caught Katy and Zak snogging in the Loft toilets but after a talk Louise promised she would not tell Justin. On the same day Sean's body was found and Warren later confessed to Louise that he killed Sean, however Louise was furious with Katy when Louise found out Katy already knew that Warren killed Sean. As revenge on Katy, Louise exposed Katy's affair with Zak to Warren and Katy was furious when Louise agreed she would be an alibi for Warren on the night of Sean's death as Louise did not want Warren to go to prison and claimed she still loved Warren although Katy wanted Warren to hand himself in to the police and pay for his crimes. Katy then verbally attacked both Warren and Louise saying \\"Oh this will be one to tell the children, oh sit down mummy and daddy want to tell you something\\", Katy then started hitting Warren and left in a rage claiming Warren and Louise were disgraceful and sick. On Wednesday 9 April 2008, Justin caught Katy and Zak snogging each other in the student halls. On Thursday 10 April 2008, Katy decided she was going to leave Hollyoaks Village for good, and as she was waiting for her taxi Justin stopped her and Katy and Justin had an extremely tearful farewell. As Katy got into her taxi Justin told her that he will always love her. As Katy was on her way out of Hollyoaks, Louise and Warren stopped the taxi and Louise violently dragged Katy out of the car and Louise confronted Katy, but Warren told Louise to let her stay and Katy had a talk. Warren desperately tried to persuade Katy to stay in Hollyoaks but she refused. Katy and Warren had a talk and Katy told Warren she could not cope with lying about Sean. Katy then got into the taxi and left Hollyoaks Village for good. On 22 July 2016, Warren tells Sienna Blake (Anna Passey) that Katy recently died of a drug overdose. On 1 February 2017, it was revealed via recorded video footage that both Joel Dexter and Bart McQueen were involved in supplying the drugs that caused Katy to overdose.

Robinson in Hazelwood Cemetery in Grinnell, IA. William C. Robinson (September 24, 1884 in Redfield, South Dakota - March 11, 1916 in near Grinnell, Iowa) was an early American aviator. Robinson moved to Grinnell in 1896 at age 12. He was a handyman, tinkerer, and bicycle repairman who designed and built his own flying machine. In 1911, with the help of Charles Hink, Robinson constructed a 60 horsepower radial motor for his monoplane. His innovations for the radial motor were revolutionary. In 1914 he set a record for non-stop flight, carrying mail from Des Moines to Kentland, Indiana. Later he founded the Grinnell Aeroplane Company. Robinson perished while flying his biplane, attempting to set an altitude record on March 11, 1916. His aircraft was witnessed climbing to altitude, before drifting down like a falling leaf, and gliding to a landing, which was controlled enough to leave skid marks, but rough enough to rupture the fuel tank and ignite the aircraft. Hypoxia was suspected among other reasons for the crash, but the fire made it impossible to verify the exact cause. On June 18, 1988, the Grinnell Regional Airport was dedicated and named Billy Robinson Field.

The film was first released in Hong Kong on October 8, 2009, and in the United States on October 23, 2009. It received mixed reviews from film critics and was a box office bomb, earning worldwide on a budget. Plot Toby Tenma is a teenage boy who lives in Metro City, a futuristic city-state that floats above the now- polluted surface of the earth. Toby's father, Dr. Tenma, is a famous roboticist and Minister of Science, but has a distant relationship with Toby. Dr. Tenma meets the city's obstructive and corrupt leader President Stone to demonstrate a new, advanced defensive robot called the Peacekeeper, to be powered by Dr. Tenma's best friend Dr. Elefun's newest creations, the Blue and Red Cores, two energy cores that emit respective opposing positive and negative energy. Against the scientists' warnings, Stone, desperate to win re- election, loads the Red Core into the Peacekeeper. This causes it to go berserk and Toby, who had snuck into the room, is accidentally disintegrated by the Peacekeeper before it can be shut down. A distraught-driven Tenma secretly constructs an android replica of Toby, and programs him with all of his human self's memories, but also makes his body with built-in defenses to protect him. Powered by the Blue Core, Toby is activated and believes himself to be his human self, but although he has his human self's mind and a similar personality, it makes him become an unfortunate reminder to Tenma about Toby's human death. Toby discovers his robot capabilities including the ability to understand non-talking robots and rocket-powered flight, but he flies away upon learning from Tenma of his origins and being rejected by him, much to Elefun's sadness. Stone has his forces pursue Toby, but the battle leads to him falling off the city edge to the surface when Stone's flagship blasts him with missiles. Tenma escapes arrest by agreeing to deactivate Toby and give up the blue core. Toby awakens in an enormous junkyard, created from the redundant robots of Metro City, having been dumped by it. He meets a group of orphaned children, illiterate but smart Zane, twins Sludge and Widget, and the oldest Cora, who also holds a grudge against Metro City, that are accompanied by a dog-like waste disposal robot named Trashcan. Toby also meets the members of the Robot Revolutionary Front (RRF), Sparx the brains, Robotsky the muscle, and Mike the Fridge, who plan to free robots from mankind's control, but are very inept and bound by the Laws of Robotics. While attempting to recruit him for their cause, they rename Toby \\"Astro\\". After a brief standoff, Astro departs with the children and finds, contrary to the belief of the citizens of Metro City, that people still live on the surface. He is taken in by the caretaker of the orphans Hamegg, a robot repairman who also runs a robot fighting ring and claims his love for robots. The next day, Astro comes across an old, offline construction robot named Zog, whom he revives through sharing some of the Blue Core's energy. Hamegg accidentally scans Astro, finding out he is really a robot and paralyzes him with his electrical blaster the next day to use him in the fighting ring. Astro reluctantly defeats Hamegg's fighters until Zog is deployed. He refuses to fight Zog and finds that Zog refuses to fight him. When Hamegg cruelly assaults them both, Zog, who predates the Laws of Robotics, fights back and attempts to kill him. However, Astro protects Hamegg, showing mercy to the former. Stone's forces arrive to take Astro back to Metro City, and he willingly surrenders himself and goes with them. Reuniting with Tenma and Elefun, Astro agrees to be deactivated, apologizing to his father for not being a satisfying way to replace his human self. Realizing even though Astro was not Toby, he is still his son, Dr. Tenma reactivates him and lets him escape. Furious, Stone reloads the Red Core into the Peacekeeper to send it after Astro, only for it to absorb him and take on his personality. The Peacekeeper then absorbs weapons and buildings, causing it to become as big as skyscrapers and terrorizes Metro City, prompting Astro to battle it. During the fight, as Astro's surface friends try to help him, Metro City's power station is destroyed, causing it to fall to the ground. Astro uses his superhuman strength to help it land safely. The Peacekeeper tries absorbing Astro to obtain his core, but the connection of their cores causes them both pain before separating them. Dr. Tenma finds Astro and informs him if the two cores unite, they will be destroyed. When the children are captured, Astro selflessly flies into the Red Core, destroying the Peacekeeper. Stone survives but is arrested for his actions. Elefun and the children find Astro's body, slightly damaged but lifeless. Zog however, revives Astro by sharing back the Blue Core energy that revived him. As Astro reunites with all his friends and his father, the city is suddenly attacked by a monstrous cycloptic extraterrestrial, and Astro Boy immediately leaps into action.

Production =Development= In 1997, Sony Pictures Entertainment purchased the film rights to Astro Boy from Tezuka Productions, intending to produce a live-action feature film. Todd Alcott was set to write the screenplay, but the film halted in 2000 when Steven Spielberg began A.I., another film with a robot boy who replaces a dead child. In December 2001, Sony hired Eric Leighton to direct an all-CGI film, with Angry Films and Jim Henson Productions producing it for a 2004 release. A screenplay draft was written, but the film did not go into production, and Leighton left in early 2003 to pursue other film projects. In June 2004, animator and Dexter's Laboratory creator Genndy Tartakovsky was hired to direct a live- action/animatronics/CGI feature film. After writing the script, the film didn't go into the production, and Tartakovsky left next year to direct 3-D-animated feature films at a new studio, Orphanage Animation Studios. Few months later it was revealed, that he was set to direct The Dark Crystal sequel, The Power of the Dark Crystal, another co-production with Jim Henson Productions. In September 2006, it was announced that Hong Kong-based animation firm Imagi Animation Studios would produce a CGI animated Astro Boy film, with Colin Brady directing it. A year later, the studio made a three- picture distribution deal with Warner Bros. and The Weinstein Company, which also included TMNT and Gatchaman. In 2008, Summit Entertainment took over the film's distribution rights. The same year, Brady was replaced with David Bowers, who previously directed Flushed Away, the last project under the relationship between DreamWorks Animation and Aardman, the creator of Wallace & Gromit. =Design= Image of Astro Boy in an early prerelease footage When adapting the film for a western audience and making the leap from 2D to 3D, some changes to Astro had to be made. The more challenging was his kawaii portrayal, part of which were his large eyes and curly eyelashes, features that the filmmakers thought made him too feminine. Imagi had several discussions on how round and curvy Astro's body proportions should be and in the end they were made slimmer. The by-product of these changes was Astro's Caucasian look. In early development Astro's design was younger, resembling his iconic design of a 6-year-old boy. The design team changed that and made him look like a 13-year-old to appeal to a larger audience. They also gave him a white shirt, and a blue jacket since they thought it would be strange to have a normal boy running around without one. They also replaced his heart- shaped energy core with a glowing blue one. =Music= The score to Astro Boy was composed by John Ottman, who recorded his score with a 95-piece orchestra and choir at Abbey Road Studios. A soundtrack album was released on October 20, 2009, by Var√®se Sarabande Records. Songs in Astro Boy not composed by John Ottman are as follows: Breezy Day, composed by Roger-Roger. All Right, written by Daniel Goffey, Gaz Coombes, and Michael Quinn and performed by Supergrass. Marching Down the Field, composed by Harry Edwards. Release =Marketing= Beginning in May 2009 and continuing through September 2009, IDW Publishing published a \\"prequel\\" and comic book adaptation of the film as both mini-series and in graphic novel format to coincide with the North American release of the film in October 2009. A model of a motionless Astro Boy waiting to be powered up was set up at Peak Tower, Hong Kong, outside Madame Tussauds Hong Kong in September 2009. A panel of the film was held at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 23, 2009. =Home media= Astro Boy was released in the US on DVD and Blu-ray March 16, 2010, by Summit Entertainment. Both releases include two new animated sequences; a featurette with the voice cast including Nicolas Cage, Kristen Bell, Freddie Highmore, and Donald Sutherland, among others; three other featurettes about drawing Astro Boy, making an animated movie and getting the Astro Boy look; and an image gallery. In Japan a special Limited Edition Astro Boy Premium Box Set was released. It featured the same content from the US release with the exception of it spanning on two DVDs (One the film, the other special features with two bonus features exclusive to Japanese) and has both English and Japanese dub (along with English and Japanese subtitles.) The box set also comes with a DVD (containing a single story on Astro's first flight and an image gallery), Dr Tenma's Project Notes (featuring 80 pages of 3-D-CGI models, character art and set designs from the film), a Micro SD (featuring the motion manga Atomu Tanjo (Birth of Astro Boy) originally written by Osamu Tezuka), a postcard of 1980 Astro Boy flying, a small bookmark (that is actually a reel from the film inside a plastic cover), and Astro's blueprints from the film. Reception =Critical response= The film received mixed reviews from film critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 50% of 137 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 5.6 out of 10. The site's general consensus is that \\"While it isn't terribly original, and it seems to have a political agenda that may rankle some viewers, Astro Boy boasts enough visual thrills to please its target demographic.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns an average rating out of 100 to reviews from film critics, has a rating score of 53 based on 22 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B and wrote of the film having \\"little too much lost-boys-and-girls mopiness\\", but \\"Astro Boy is a marvelously designed piece of cartoon kinetics...\\" Glenn Whipp of the Los Angeles Times gave the mixed review claiming \\"The kids won't get it but will enjoy the big, climactic robot rumpuses, which owe a heavy debt to Brad Bird's The Iron Giant\\". =Box office= The film was a flop in Japan, appearing at the bottom of the opening week's Top 10 rankings and earning only $328,457. Conversely, the film was very successful in China, breaking a box-office record for a CGI animated film. This follows the same pattern as Dragonball Evolution and Speed Racer, other American-produced films based on Japanese sources that were not big hits in the land of their origin but were very successful in China. The film also was a box office bomb in the U.S., opening at #6, grossing $6.7 million, losing out to the similarly retro Where the Wild Things Are. It remained in the Top 10 for three weeks. When it closed in January 2010, it had a total gross of $20 million. Due to these factors, the film would only produce a worldwide gross of $44.6 million against a $65 million budget. Video game A video game based on the film was released on October 20, 2009, by D3 Publisher to coincide with the film's theatrical release. The Wii, PlayStation 2 and PSP versions were developed by High Voltage Software, and the Nintendo DS version by Art Co., Ltd.

Biography Yosef Sprinzak was born in Moscow, Russia but following the expulsion of Jews in 1891 moved with his family to Kishinev where he was a founder of the Tze'irei Zion (Zion Youth). He began medical school at the American University in Beirut in 1908 and settled in Palestine in 1910, during the Second Aliyah (1904‚Äì1914). Along with Eliezer Kaplan Sprinzak headed Hapoel Hatzair (\\"The Young Worker\\") a Zionist socialist faction formed in 1905 and one of the organisations that consolidated to form Mapai in 1930. Its members were pro-British and supported Chaim Weizmann.Sofer, 2003, pp. xi; xii; 99. He was a founder of the Histadrut in 1920 and acted as secretary general of the organisation from 1945 to 1949. His son Yair Sprinzak also served in the Knesset. Another son, Aharon David Sprinzak, an Israeli Air Force pilot, was killed in action during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. His grandson, Ehud Sprinzak (1940-2002) was one of Israel's foremost experts on counterterrorism and far-right Jewish groups. Political career Sprinzak was elected to the position of speaker of the provisional parliament on 15 July 1948,Goldberg, 2003, p. 32. a role in which he helped lay the foundations of Israel's parliamentarism.Sofer, 1998, p. 115. He was elected to the first Knesset in 1949 as a member of Mapai, and became the Speaker of the new body. He was re-elected and remained speaker in both the second and third Knessets. As part of his role as speaker, Sprinzak became acting President of Israel when Chaim Weizmann fell ill from 12 December 1951. After Weizmann's death on 9 November 1952 Sprinzak served as interim President until inauguration of Yitzhak Ben-Zvi on 10 December 1952. References Bibliography * Goldberg, Giora (2003).

This list includes chancellors of the reign of Wu Zetian, which she referred to as the \\"Zhou dynasty\\" (), rather than \\"Tang\\" ().  Origins  Ouyang Xiu, the author of the New Book of Tang, asserts that the Tang dynasty inherited its bureaucracy from its dynastic predecessor, the Sui Dynasty, under which the founder Emperor Wen of Sui divided his government into five main bureaus: * Sh√†ngsh≈´shƒõng (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ) -- The Department of State Affairs * M√©nxi√†shƒõng (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ) -- The Chancellery * N√®ish«êshƒõng (ÂÖßÂè≤ÁúÅ) -- The Legislative Bureau (note different tone than the eunuch bureau below) * M√¨sh≈´shƒõng (ÁßòÊõ∏ÁúÅ) -- The Palace Library * N√®ish√¨shƒõng (ÂÖß‰æçÁúÅ) -- The Eunuch bureau (note different tone than the legislative bureau above), later changed by Emperor Wen's son Emperor Yang of Sui to Di√†nn√®ishƒõng (ÊÆøÂÖßÁúÅ) Under Emperor Wen, the executive bureau was regarded as the most important, and he had his most honored officials such as Gao Jiong, Yang Su, and Su Wei lead it at various points. Its heads were generally regarded as chancellors (as it always had two heads, known as the Sh√†ngsh≈´p√∫sh√® (Â∞öÊõ∏ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ)). Ouyang asserts, however, that the heads of the examination and legislative bureaus were also considered chancellors.New Book of Tang, vol. 61.  Tang reorganization  The Tang dynasty founder Emperor Gaozu initially followed the Sui's system of governance, including the five- bureau organization. However, he deviated from his predecessors by creating a single head for the executive bureau, known as the Sh√†ngsh≈´l«êng (Â∞öÊõ∏‰ª§) and appointed the office to his second son and future emperor L«ê Sh√¨m√≠n (Êùé‰∏ñÊ∞ë).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 185. After Li Shimin became emperor in 626, the office was left vacant because none of his officials dared to occupy it. Thus from the year 626 the executive bureau was headed by its two vice-directors, the Sh√†ngsh≈´p√∫sh√®.Charles Hucker, A Dictionary of Official Titles in Imperial China (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1985), p. 394, entry 4826. Around this time, probably by Emperor Taizong's orders, the institution of multiple chancellors was formalized, with the heads of the executive, examination, and legislative (which was renamed the Zh≈çngsh≈´shƒõng (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ)) bureaus regarded as the chancellors. As there were often, but not always, more than one head for the examination and legislative bureaus, there were not necessarily only four chancellors. Emperor Taizong's reign also began to designate certain high- level officials, even though they were not heads of one of the bureaus, as chancellors, with titles such as CƒÅny√π Ch√°ozh√®ng (ÂèÉË±´ÊúùÊîø, literally \\"participator in the administration's governance\\"). Yet later in 643, he revised the designation and formalized it as the T√≥ngzh≈çngsh≈´m√©nxi√†sƒÅnp«ên (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏âÂìÅ, literally meaning \\"equivalent to the officials with the third rank from the Zh≈çngsh≈´ and the M√©nxi√†\\") ‚Äî because the heads of the legislative bureau, the Zh≈çngsh≈´l«êng (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§), and the examination bureau, the Sh√¨zh≈çng (‰æç‰∏≠), were of the third rank. These officials were rendered as \\"chancellors de facto'\\" Sh√≠zh√¨z«éixi√†ng (ÂØ¶Ë≥™ÂÆ∞Áõ∏) by the Chinese historian Bo Yang in his modern Chinese edition of the Zizhi Tongjian. Throughout Tang history, the names of the examination and legislative bureaus were changed multiple times, and so the designation of T√≥ngzh≈çngsh≈´ M√©nxi√† SƒÅnp«ên was frequently changed in response thereof. For example, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong, when the legislative bureau was briefly known as the Z«êw√©ishƒõng (Á¥´ÂæÆÁúÅ) and the examination bureau the Hu√°ngm√©nshƒõng (ÈªÉÈñÄÁúÅ), the chancellors de facto were known as the T√≥ng Z«êw√©i Hu√°ngm√©n SƒÅnp«ên.New Book of Tang, vol. 62. A lesser designation, with the same powers, was created in 682 during the reign of Emperor Gaozong, and was initially known as the T√≥ng Zh≈çngsh≈´ M√©nxi√† P√≠ngzhƒÅngsh√¨ (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã, literally \\"equivalent to the participators from the Zh≈çngsh≈´ and the M√©nxi√†\\"), rendered by Bo as \\"chancellors de facto second grade.\\" Later in Tang history, after the Anshi Rebellion, while the chancellor-de facto designation was not officially abolished, it was no longer in use, as the last chancellor to be designated as such was Li Lin, in 757‚Äì758,However, one of Li Lin's contemporaries, L√º Yin, was said to have carried the title as well when he became chancellor in 759 until his removal in 760, but the table of chancellors in the New Book of Tang did not indicate such.

Furthermore, after 705,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 208. the heads of the executive bureau were no longer considered chancellors unless they received the chancellor-de facto designation of either kind.Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 45. Throughout the early dynasty until the second reign of Emperor Ruizong in 710, variations of the Canyu Chaozheng also continued appearing, including Canzhi Jiwu (ÂèÉÁü•Ê©üÂãô, literally \\"participator in important matters\\"), Canzhang Jimi (ÂèÉÊéåÊ©üÂØÜ, literally \\"participator in national secret matters\\"), Canzhi Zhengshi (ÂèÉÁü•Êîø‰∫ã, literally \\"participator in governance matters\\"), Canmou Zhengshi (ÂèÉË¨ÄÊîø‰∫ã, similarly in meaning to Canzhi Zhengshi) also appeared, which Bo rendered as \\"chancellors de facto of the third class.\\" The chancellors periodically met together at the Zhengshi Tang (Êîø‰∫ãÂ†Ç, literally \\"the Hall of State Matters\\"), originally physically located within the examination bureau. In 683, when Pei Yan, then the head of the examination bureau, became the head of the legislative bureau, the Zhengshi Tang was moved from the examination bureau to the legislative bureau. Later, during Emperor Xuanzong's reign, when Zhang Shuo became chancellor, he changed the name to Zhongshu Menxia (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã), apparently employing a double entendre, as when the terms were put together, they meant, \\"within the doors of the Zhongshu.\\"New Book of Tang, vol. 46. Zhang also reorganized the Hall by creating five offices under the chancellors‚Äîin charge of civil service, state secrets, military matters, governance, and criminal law, respectively. Later in the dynasty‚Äîstarting during the reign of Emperor Suzong ‚Äî the chancellors begin to rotate off-days so that at least one would always be on duty; when submissions were to be made to the emperor, they were signed in the names of all chancellors, whether on duty or not. The name of their meeting place also changed back to Zhengshi Tang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 225.  List of Tang chancellors  This list includes the chancellors during the Zhou Dynasty of Wu Zetian, even though the propriety of considering it as part of the Tang Dynasty is disputed.

Liu Youqiu, who held the title as Zhi Junguo Zhongshi, was the last person to hold any variation of the title as chancellor as a regular title, although Pei Du would hold the title of Pingzhang Junguo Zhongshi (Âπ≥Á´†ËªçÂúãÈáç‰∫ã) briefly in 830. Toward the end of the dynasty, Li Zhirou was briefly put temporarily in charge of the Office of the Chancellors in 895 with the designation Quanzhi Zhongshu Shi (Ê¨äÁü•‰∏≠Êõ∏‰∫ã) and therefore could be regarded as a chancellor as well (and was listed in the table of chancellors in the New Book of Tang); similarly, Lu Guangqi went through two similar titles. * Zhang Liang (643‚Äì646) (as Canyu Chaozheng (ÂèÉË±´ÊúùÊîø)) * Chu Suiliang (644‚Äì647, 648) (as Canyu Chaozheng) * Xu Jingzong (645)Xu Jingzong, Gao Jifu, and Zhang Xingcheng were referred to as de facto chancellors by the New Book of Tang, vol. 61, but this appeared to be a temporary measure during the Goguryeo campaign with Emperor Taizong out of Tang territory and Li Zhi in charge temporarily. Xu, Gao, Zhang (each of whom would be later made chancellor) were not again referred to as chancellors until they were made chancellors after Emperor Taizong's death, even though they were not explicitly removed.

The Ancient Grand Lodge of England, as it is known today, or The Grand Lodge of the Most Ancient and Honourable Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons (according to the Old Constitutions granted by His Royal Highness Prince Edwin, at York, Anno Domini nine hundred and twenty six, and in the year of Masonry four thousand nine hundred and twenty six) as they described themselves on their warrants,J. Brown, Masonry in Wigan, Platt 1882 was a rival Grand Lodge to the Premier Grand Lodge of England. It existed from 1751 until 1813 when the United Grand Lodge of England was created from the two Grand Lodges. They are now called the Antients, in contrast to the Moderns, the original Grand Lodge which its critics, notably Laurence Dermott, said had moved away from the ritual of Scotland, Ireland, and now the Antient Grand Lodge. This Grand Lodge was also informally called the Atholl Grand Lodge because the Third and Fourth Dukes of Atholl presided over it as Grand Masters for half of its 62-year existence.Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon The Formation of the Grand Lodge of the Antients, I. R. Clarke, Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, vol 79 (1966), p. 270‚Äì73, retrieved 16 September 2012 Although the Grand Lodge never spelled Antient with a 't', the convention was followed by the Moderns, and continues to be used by United Grand Lodge. Some confusion arises from the Ancients' own documentation. Their seals are inscribed Grand Lodge in London of Free and Accepted Masons According to the Old Institution(s), while in their masonic certificates, issued to new members, they called themselves the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of England according to the Old Constitutions.J. Ramsden Riley, Masonic Certificates, Quatuor Coronati Antigrapha, Vol VIII, 1891 History From about 1721, the new Grand Lodge which had been formed in London in 1717, and would soon spread to the rest of England, Wales, and abroad, pursued a policy of self-publicity and expansion that did not always sit well with other Freemasons. They abandoned the old methods of \\"drawing\\" lodges with chalk, (erased with a mop) in favour of tape and portable metal letters.F. De P. Castells, The Origin of the Masonic Degrees, (reprinted) Kessinger Publishing, 2003, pp 39‚Äì40 In 1735 they refused admission to the Master and Wardens of an Irish lodge who claimed to be a deputation from Lord Kingston, then Grand Master of Ireland and past Grand Master of the English Grand Lodge. The Irish masons were offered admission if they would accept the English constitution, which they refused.The Minutes of the Grand Lodge of Freemasons of England, 1723‚Äì1739, Quatuor Coronatorum Antigrapha,Vol 10, 1913, p 259 In the 1730s the English Grand Lodge had changed their ritual to stay ahead of public exposures. During this period, London absorbed many economic migrants from Ireland. Those who were already masons were often repelled by the changes introduced by the English Grand Lodge, and either formed their own lodges, or joined one of the many unaffiliated lodges in the capital. In 1751, five of these, and a sixth that had just been formed, united to form a rival Grand Lodge, which quickly became an umbrella organisation for the other unaffiliated lodges in England. This success must be seen as a triumph of the energy, wit, and sheer belligerence of their second Grand Secretary, Laurence Dermott. Most of what we know of him comes from the minutes of Grand Lodge and from his book of constitutions. The Grand Committee met on the first Wednesday of every month, and on 5 February 1752, Dermott replaced John Morgan as Grand Secretary. The next month he dealt with the \\"Leg of Mutton\\" masons, two men who had initiated masons into the Royal Arch for the price of a leg of mutton, but on examination by Dermott, knew nothing of the degree. They also claimed to teach a masonic method of achieving invisibility. In April he persuaded his brethren to replace Morgan's bye-laws with those of his own lodge in Dublin. June saw Dermott installing the Grand Officers. The lodge met as usual on Wednesday 2 September, and were treated to a lecture on their ritual by Dermott. Due to the change that year from the Julian to the Gregorian Calendar, the next day was Thursday 14 September, losing 11 days. The actual business of the lodge was conducted at an \\"emergency\\" meeting on the 14th, ensuring both dates appeared in the minutes.Witham Matthew Bywater, Notes on Laurence Dermott G.S. and his Work, London, 1884. Dermott gave them a book of constitutions, inexplicably entitled \\"Ahiman Rezon, or a Help to a Brother\\". It was modeled on Spratt's Irish Constitutions, which in turn were modeled on Anderson's constitutions. The introductory history was replaced by a satirical account of Dermott's attempt to write a better one (which would trace Freemasonry to before the Creation). The publication of the first edition, in 1756, may have been delayed until the society had found a noble sponsor to act as Grand Master. He arrived in the form of the Earl of Blessington, who had already served as Grand Master in Ireland. The second edition, in 1764, compared the ancient practices of the new Grand Lodge with the works of the \\"Moderns\\". The older Grand Lodge had been castigated as the \\"Moderns\\" since the 1720s, and the term is still used today. Dermott's characterisation of the Moderns is scathing and satirical, and with each succeeding edition during his lifetime, more scorn is heaped on the society that deviated from the established landmarks of the order, and whose greatest masonic symbols were the knife and fork. After his death, in 1791, successive editors of Ahiman Rezon progressively excised the insults.Association of Atholl Lodges Ray Sheppard, Ahiman Rezon,retrieved 23 September 2012Google books Ahiman Rezon (pdf), 2nd edition, London, 1764, retrieved 30 June 2012 The Ahiman Rezon, although divisive, proved popular, and the Ancients flourished. They were recognised by the Grand Lodges of Ireland and Scotland, who continued to view the innovations of the Moderns with suspicion. A low point in relations between the two Grand Lodges was reached in the 1770s, when William Preston, then assistant Grand Secretary of the Moderns, attempted to poison the relationship between the Ancients and the Grand Lodge of Scotland. After Dermott's death, the two Grand Lodges moved slowly towards union. The need for unity was underlined during the Napoleonic wars, when the leaders of the Ancients, Moderns, and the Grand Lodge of Scotland acted together to prevent their lodges becoming proscribed organisations.Pietre Stones The Unlawful Societies Act of 1799, Dr Andrew Prescott, from M. D. J. Scanlan, ed., The Social Impact of Freemasonry on the Modern Western World The Canonbury Papers I (London: Canonbury Masonic Research Centre, 2002), pp. 116‚Äì134, retrieved 13 July 2012 However, the actual process of unification did not start until 1811, when the Moderns started the administrative process of returning their ritual to a form acceptable to the other British Grand Lodges. The final union was in the hands of two sons of the King, the Duke of Sussex, the Grand Master of the Moderns, and the Duke of Kent. Kent had already effected a union in Canada by simply abolishing the Moderns, and merging their lodges with those of the Ancients. The new Grand Lodge, the United Grand Lodge of England, retained the infrastructure of the Moderns, and the ritual of the Ancients.Encyclopedia of Freemasonry retrieved 17 July 2012 Revival in Lancashire In 1823, the mishandling of grievances of a few Lancastrian masons led to an attempt to revive the Ancients in what has come to be known as the Wigan Grand Lodge. Mistrust of the new Grand Lodge was already simmering when the Provincial Grand Lodge meeting at Manchester in 1818 asked that the book of constitutions be amended to state that a lodge must hand back its warrant if membership falls below 7, instead of the 5 stated.The minimum number is still 5, UGLE constitutions, rule 188. Further concern was shown when some masons in Bath were told that it was \\"not desirable to make the Number of (Royal Arch) Chapters in any place equal to the Number of Lodges.\\" The low minimum implied that it was possible to run a lodge without Deacons, in the manner of the Moderns ritual, and the Ancients had looked on the Royal Arch as the fourth degree, making the formation of a Chapter the duty of every lodge. These queries, prompted by a concern as to a creeping return, or even imposition, of Modernism on old Ancient's lodges, were ignored by Grand Lodge. This led to a more strongly worded remonstrance in 1820. As the local province failed to deal with increasing animosity, in 1822 the 34 masons who signed the last document were suspended by Grand Lodge, and one Liverpool lodge was erased. Although many of the rebels returned to the fold or left masonry altogether, the harshness of their treatment drew support from other lodges in the North West of England. A new Grand Lodge was formed in Liverpool in 1823, calling itself the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of England according to the Old Constitutions. From 1825, it met only in Wigan. As the original dispute was gradually forgotten, its twelve or more lodges were re-absorbed by UGLE, although the last did not rejoin until 1913. It ceased to function as a Grand Lodge in 1866.E. B.

He attended Newcome's School in Hackney, where he acquired a taste for drama; in May 1802 he presented a five-act comedy at Covent Garden entitled The Word of Honour, followed the next season by another at Drury Lane entitled The High Road to Marriage; both were moderately successful, with his first major achievement being a \\"grand legendary melodrama\\", The Sleeping Beauty, presented at Drury Lane in May 1805.

None are believed to have been printed, bar some portions of Sleeping Beauty. He succeeded to the baronetcy on 26 January 1815, as the only surviving son of his father, William Charles Farrell-Skeffington, 1st Baronet of Skeffington Hall, Leicestershire (but did not inherit Skeffington Hall itself, which had been sold in 1814). However, he had never married, and the title became extinct on his death for lack of an heir. He was a noted dandy and was consulted on dress and style by the Prince Regent.

The story from which Malanka originates  The Ukrainian New Year obtained the name Malanka from a Christianized folk tale of pagan origin, as collected and published by a Ukrainian ethnographer. The story is based on the creator god Praboh, and his four sons and one daughter. One of his sons was the Devil, the second son was St. George (Yar-Yarylo), the third St. John (Rai), and the fourth was Lad or Myr (Peace). The one daughter is an earth goddess named Lada, who had two children: a son called the Moon and a daughter \\"Spring-May\\", later referred to as Mylanka because she was loving (–º–∏–ª–∞). As mother Earth, she was responsible for the blooming of flowers and the greenery of spring. In a version of the myth of Hades and Persephone, Mylanka's evil uncle (the Devil) desired her presence in the underworld and abducted her one- day when the Moon was hunting. While she was gone, the Earth was left without spring and once she was released from the vices of the Devil, flowers began to bloom and greenery spread around the world. Ukrainians celebrate Malanka to symbolize the onset of spring.  Ukrainian traditions  On the morning of this day the second ritual kutia is prepared‚Äîthe \\"generous\\" kutia. Unlike the \\"bahata\\" kutia on Sviat Vechir, it is made with non-Lenten ingredients. As is done on Sviat Vechir, the kutia is placed in the pokuttia (the corner of the house opposite the pich (stove), where the icons are hung). In addition, the women bake mlyntsi (pancakes), and make pyrihs and dumplings with cheese, to give as gifts to the carolers and \\"sowers\\". Food is given a very important role: on Malanka, as it is believed that the more variety on the table that day, the more generous next year will be. The dishes should be very satisfying, but, for example, cooking fish is a bad sign, because happiness can \\"pour\\" out of the home. Pork dishes are definitely prepared, as this animal symbolizes abundance in the house. Traditionally, pork is prepared as kholodets (meat in aspic), blood and pork sausages, vershchaky (roasted pork marinated in beet kvas), salo (lardo), stuffed whole pig, and more. In the evenings and until midnight, the carolers stroll by the houses of the village. According to ancient tradition, New Year's caroling by the \\"malankary\\", like Christmas caroling, occurs after sunset, that is, when evil spirits rule. Teenaged girls, alone or in a group, run around to their neighbors to carol. They are rewarded with food and sweets. Young men also go about on Malanka. This is called \\"leading M–∞lanka\\". Young men in masks express good wishes, and amuse with funny songs, dances, and skits. One of them is usually dressed in women's clothing and is called Melanka. According to custom, after finishing their ritual rounds, the next morning the young men went to a crossroads to burn the \\"Did or \\"Didukh\\"‚Äîa sheaf of grain that had stood in the pokuttia since Sviat Vechir (Christmas Eve)‚Äîand then jumped over a bonfire. This was meant to cleanse them after dealing with the evil spirits all night. The next day, when it began to grow light, the young men go to \\"sow grain\\". The grain is carried in a glove or bag. First they visit their godparents and other relatives and loved ones, then their neighbors. Entering the house, the sower sows grain and greets everyone with the New Year: I sow, I sow, I sow, I greet you with the New Year! Good fortune, and good health in the New Year, May your fields bear better this year than last, Rye, wheat and any grains, Hemp piled to the ceiling in large rolls. Be healthy for the New Year and Basil's Day! God grant us this! The first sower to visit on New Year's day brings happiness to the house. According to popular belief, girls do not bring happiness, only boys do, and therefore it is not appropriate for girls to go \\"sowing\\".  Malanka celebrations in North America In North America, Ukrainian organizations have created events at banquet halls to help celebrate Malanka. These events are Ukrainian versions of a New year's Eve ball. They typically occur a week after Christmas Eve (Old Calendar), but not necessarily falling on 13 or 14 January; they are usually held on an ensuing Friday or Saturday night. These \\"Malanky\\" gather the whole local Ukrainian community, and allow people to enjoy themselves while honoring their cultural background. People come to these events ready to socialize and celebrate the New Year with friends and family. The event provides a nice dinner, often with raffles and prizes to be won, and usually ends with a zabava (dance). At midnight, once everyone cheers for the New Year, individual and pair polka dancing is stopped and the kolomyika begins. When the kolomyjka is finished, everyone resumes to their previous dancing and continue to party the night away. Malanka is often the last opportunity for partying before the solemn period of Lent which precedes Easter.

His music has been heard on the New York stage, major TV networks, and in many recordings.  His Early Years  Binyumen was born in the East New York section of Brooklyn, NY, the youngest of four children. His father, Mordkhe Schaechter, was a native of the city of Chernivtsi / CernƒÉu»õi / Czernovitz, which was part of Romania when Mordkhe was born, and since World War II has been a part of Ukraine. Binyumen's mother, Charlotte Schaechter n√©e Saffian, was born in Brooklyn and grew up in the Bronx. Her parents had come from the towns of Holoskove and Orynyn, both in Ukraine. Binyumen's family moved to Bainbridge Avenue in the Bronx in January 1966, where the family lived for some 40 years. Atypically for American families, Binyumen's parents spoke only Yiddish with the children, and insisted that the children answer in Yiddish. He attended P.S. 56 and J.H.S 80 in the Bronx, then the High School of Music and Art (now called LaGuardia High School), Columbia University and the Manhattan School of Music. During that time, he was trained classically as a composer and pianist, studying piano at the Hebrew Arts School (now the Lucy Moses School) with Natan Brand, and composition privately with Dr. Miriam Gideon and then with John Corigliano, Jr. But when Binyumen heard the score to Pippin while he was at Columbia University, he became fascinated with American musical theatre and began composing his first musical theatre songs shortly afterward. After graduating from Manhattan School of Music, he decided to pursue a career as a composer in musical theatre.  His Musical Work  Off-Broadway, Ben's music has been represented in Naked Boys Singing (fourth longest-running show in Off-Broadway history, with a subsequent film release), Pets! (Dramatic Publishing), That‚Äôs Life! (Outer Critics Circle nominee), Too Jewish? (Drama Desk, Outer Critics Circle nominee) and Double Identity. In its review of Double Identity, The New York Times wrote, ‚ÄúAmong its [the show's] assets...is the ear-catching score by Ben Schaechter, whose wide-ranging gifts have buoyed recent hit revues like That‚Äôs Life! and Too Jewish?‚Äù His revue It Helps to Sing About It is the winner of 2018 Bistro Award for outstanding revue . Binyumen is the conceiver, musical director/arranger, and translator of a half-dozen Yiddish musical theater works, including The Shtetl Comes to Life and From Kinahora to Coney Island. Most recently, they have featured his actor-singer daughters, Di Shekhter-tekhter (a.k.a. Reyna Schaechter & Temma Schaechter) as the three of them have traveled the world performing in Yiddish since their debut in Paris in 2008. A documentary film / concert video of \\"Di Shekhter-tekhter\\" ‚Äì When Our Bubbas And Zeydas Were Young: The Schaechter Sisters On Stage ‚Äì was released on DVD in 2012 by Ergo Media. It was directed by Josh Waletzky, Academy Award-nominated documentary film director, known for his films Image Before My Eyes and Partisans of Vilna. Binyumen is the conductor of the outstanding Jewish People's Philharmonic Chorus, a 50-voice, largely a cappella intergenerational Yiddish chorus. Defying the stereotypes of Yiddish music, the works performed by the JPPC include Yiddish cantatas, oratorios and operettas, Classical works that have been translated into Yiddish (including works by Beethoven, Handel, Mendelssohn, Shostakovich and Tchaikovsky), and shorter 4-part Yiddish choral arrangements of Yiddish theatre music, Holocaust music, contemporary songs, and more. Venues where the JPPC has performed over the past decade include Symphony Space, Alice Tully Hall, Cathedral of St. John the Divine, West Point Military Academy, the North American Jewish Choral Festival, and Shea Stadium. The JPPC released its first CD in 2006, Zingt! A Celebration of Yiddish Choral Music.  His Non-Musical Work  Almost all of Binyumen's non-musical work has involved the Yiddish language. As an actor, he was featured, in Anna Deveare Smith's one-woman show at Carnegie Hall, as the \\"simultaneous\\" on-stage Yiddish translator for a couple of her monologues. He also translated into Yiddish the first-ever film (DVD) with an option of Yiddish subtitle translations, The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg. Binyumen has also done quite a bit of translating of both prose, song lyrics and aria lyrics from Yiddish into English, from English into Yiddish, and even from Italian and French into Yiddish. Apart from translating, he was for a dozen years the Coordinator of the Yidish-vokh, an annual week-long all-Yiddish summer retreat sponsored by Yugntruf Youth for Yiddish, an organization that was co-founded in 1964 by his father to promote Yiddish as an active, spoken language. The Yidish-vokh still occurs every summer. Most recently, Binyumen has begun giving lectures and leading workshops entitled Ashkenazic Family Names: What Those Names Mean, and What What They Mean Means, premiering it at the North American Jewish Choral Festival in the summer of 2014, and with upcoming engagements at KlezKamp (December 2014) and elsewhere.  Family  Schaechter is a member of a leading family in Yiddish language and cultural studies. His father, Dr. Mordkhe Schaechter, was an influential linguist of the Yiddish language, writing and editing many articles, magazines, journals, terminologies and textbooks in Yiddish and on Yiddish. His mother, Charlotte (Charne) Schaechter, spent much of her life as an accompanist to Yiddish singers. His aunt, Beyle Schaechter-Gottesman, was a Yiddish poet and songwriter and spiritual guide to many of the Klezmer musicians in the world today. Among his three sisters, Rukhl Schaechter is a journalist with the Yiddish Forward, and host of the on-line Yiddish cooking program, Est gezunterheyt!; Gitl Schaechter-Viswanath is a Yiddish poet and editor, and she sings in the Jewish People's Philharmonic Chorus; and sister Eydl Reznik teaches Yiddish among the ultra-Orthodox community in Tsfat, Israel. Schaechter and his sisters all speak only in Yiddish with their children, giving their parents 16 Yiddish- speaking grandchildren.

It ran on minicomputers from Prime Computer and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Development The system was initially developed by two graduates of Liverpool University, Dr John Davison and John Watts in the early 1970s. They took their work to architects Gollins Melvin Ward (GMW Architects) in London in the late 1970s, and developed it whilst working on a project for Riyadh University. It became the Really Universal Computer Aided Production System (RUCAPS), and from 1977 was sold through GMW Computers Ltd in several countries worldwide. The term 'building model' (in the sense of BIM as used today) was first used in papers in the mid-1980s: in a 1985 paper by Simon Ruffle,Ruffle S. (1985) \\"Architectural design exposed: from computer-aided- drawing to computer-aided-design\\" Environments and Planning B: Planning and Design 1986 March 7 pp 385-389. and later in a 1986 paper by Robert AishAish, R. (1986) \\"Building Modelling: The Key to Integrated Construction CAD\\" CIB 5th International Symposium on the Use of Computers for Environmental Engineering related to Building, 7‚Äì9 July. \\\\- then at GMW Computers - referring to the software's use at London's Heathrow Airport.cited by Laiserin, Jerry (2008), Foreword to Eastman, C., et al (2008), op cit, p.xii RUCAPS was a significant milestone in the development of building modellers, selling many hundreds of copies during the early 1980s when CAD was rare and expensive, and introducing thousands of architects to computer aided design. It is regarded as a forerunner to today's BIM software, and is seen by some writers, e.g.: Jerry Laiserin, as the inspiration behind Autodesk's Revit: :While Autodesk Revit may not contain genomic snippets of Reflex code, Revit clearly is spiritual heir to a lineage of BIM \\"begats\\" ‚Äî RUCAPS begat Sonata, Sonata begat Reflex, and Reflex begat Revit.Laiserin, J. (2003) \\"LaiserinLetterLetters\\" (see Laiserin's comment to letter from John Mullan), The Laiserin Letter, January 06 2003. RUCAPS was superseded in the mid-late 1980s by Sonata, developed by Jonathan Ingram. This was sold to T2 Solutions (renamed from GMW Computers in 1987), which was eventually bought by AliasWavefront but then \\"disappeared in a mysterious, corporate black hole, somewhere in eastern Canada in 1992.\\" Ingram then went on to develop Reflex, bought out by Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC) in 1996. =Comparison with BIM= In 1984, RUCAPS was described as a 2¬Ω dimensional interactive system, closer to the philosophy of 2D interactive systems such as ARK/2 or DAISY,Reynolds, R.A. (1984) Computer Methods for Architects, Butterworths, London. pp 78-79. and concentrating on the rapid production of 2D drawings (plans, elevations and sections). During the early 1980s, Ingram worked on a supplementary 3D file structure for RUCAPS, where, by running a separate program and with manual intervention, a flat 3D file could be generated, allowing the production of perspectives and images. RUCAPS did carry the 'weather vane' concept from UK-based Applied Research's Building Design System, BDS, now found in most modern BIM systems, but did not have interactive 3D windows or rule-based language - core characteristics of today's BIM applications. The system RUCAPS was a building modelling system. It used the concept, introduced by BDS, of 2¬Ω dimensional representation of components, straddling the divide between two dimensions (2D, i.e. flat) and three (3D). Here, all the elements of the design were placed in space in three dimensions, but each element, such as a window, door, chair or wall, was modelled in a series of 2D views. These views were of the plan and two elevations, each of which were drawn conventionally, as though on the side of a glass box. The \\"box\\" was then moved about the design and placed. By looking down on the model the plan view of the whole model was visible, and from the side just the elevation was seen. Because moving the component, or \\"box\\", moved both the plan view and the elevations for it, the plans and elevations remained in harmony, and designer's time was saved. RUCAPS consisted of 38 different programs. For example, there was a program to generate the geometry for building components, another to assemble them into groups, and another to assemble those sub-assemblies into a model of the building. A dozen or more modules took care of printing, copying of floors, printing schedules, and so on. In the way of the time, the user directed operations by calling up the relevant program module rather than, as today, selecting from a menu. A large computer screen displayed the building model. The screen, or sometimes two screens, was controlled from a keyboard for launching programs, and typing in coordinate data. Basic components were given several 2D views, from the top and sides. The information was usually coded onto A4 sheets of paper, and typed in as a series of coordinates. Once available to use in the building module, the components would be located using a large digitizer. This permitted a base drawing to be taped down, and used for locating the new components. The screen was then used to help ensure accuracy. Along the bottom of the digitizer was a template with commands which could be selected as required, so the keyboard was often not required. Assembly was aided for many users by the familiar look of the large digitizer, which looked much like the drawing boards common at the time. To aid the process of aclimatistion, the digitizer was used with an electronic pen, which made placing components both quick and accurate. MIni computers were used to power the system. Initially single-user, the system soon graduated to larger computers that could handle eight or more workstations simultaneously. The nature of building modeling systems is that very little information needs to be transferred from the database to the workstation, so performance levels were good despite what looks like limited equipment. Most early display screens were monochrome, but later RUCAPS systems were colour. All were using vector graphics, which was a step up from the earlier storage tubes. Plotters were large format and pen based, using amid of roller ball pens and Rotring wet ink pens of several thicknesses and colour. RUCAPS was expensive, as was all CAD at the time, so its use was confined to large building projects. It was then necessary to have several people working on the same model. An early multi-user system was developed, allowing single building models to be worked on simultaneously by many people. It was a system that employed layers, where components were allocated categories allowing groups of them to be switched off or on when the drawings were produced. Layering allowed, for example, drainage to be printed separately from electrical components, but still maintained on the single model. No 3D was available in RUCAPS though a totally separate 3D modelling and perspective hidden-line program called AUTOPROD written by Col. Nigel Hitch was sold alongside RUCAP. There was no database or modelling connection of any sort between RUCAPS and AUTOPROD. No clash- detection or calculations were undertaken on the model, but some hiding of one component by another was possible so that external walls showed on elevations while the internal elements were concealed in a 2¬ΩD fashion.

In 1834 a medical school attached to the hospital was formally founded. In 1939 a newly built hospital and medical school opened in Horseferry Road, Westminster. In 1994 the hospital closed, and its resources were moved to the new Chelsea and Westminster Hospital at the old St Stephen's Hospital site in Fulham Road. History =Foundation= Henry Hoare the Good, portrait by Michael Dahl 19th century engraving of the building at Broad Sanctuary which was home to Westminster Hospital from 1831 to 1939 Map of the location of the Westminster Hospital (top left) relative to Westminster Abbey and the Palace of Westminster \\\\---- Edward Stanford's map London, 1862 The Westminster Hospital was established in 1719 as a charitable society \\"for relieving the sick and needy at the Public Infirmary in Westminster\\", and promoted by Henry Hoare (1677‚Äì1725), otherwise \\"Good Henry\\", son of Sir Richard Hoare and a partner in Hoare's Bank, and his associates the writer William Wogan, a vintner called Robert Witham, and the Reverend Patrick Cockburn. In 1719, a house was rented in Petty France, to accommodate the new Infirmary for the Sick and Needy, which opened in 1720 with 10 beds. The following document, which may be styled the first annual report of this institution, dated 1720, hung framed and glazed on the wall of the secretary's room as at about 1878: :\\"Whereas a charitable proposal was published in December last (1719), for relieving the sick and needy, by providing them with lodging, with proper food and physick, and nurses to attend them during their sickness, and by procuring them the advice and assistance of physicians or surgeons, as their necessities should require; and by the blessing of God upon this undertaking, such sums of money have been advanced and subscribed by several of the nobility and gentry of both sexes and by some of the clergy, as have enabled the managers of this charity (who are as many of the subscribers as please to be present at their weekly meetings), to carry on in some measure what was then proposed:‚Äîfor the satisfaction of the subscribers and benefactors, and for animating others to promote and encourage this pious and Christian work, this is to acquaint them, that in pursuance of the foresaid charitable proposal, there is an infirmary set up in Petty France, Westminster, where the poor sick who are admitted into it, are attended by physicians, surgeons, apothecaries, and nurses, supplied with food and physick, and daily visited by some one or other of the clergy; at which place the society meets every Wednesday evening for managing and carrying on this charity, admitting and discharging patients, &c.;\\" =Moves in the eighteenth century= The hospital grew to 31 beds by 1724, necessitating a move in that year to Chappell Street (later renamed Broadway). In 1733, a disagreement between the Governors and the medical staff led to a mass exodus of medical staff, who went on to set up what became St George's Hospital. Meanwhile, the Infirmary continued with its existing Governors and moved to new premises in Buckingham Gate in 1735, where it was known as the Westminster Infirmary for the Sick and Infirm. By 1757 there were 98 beds and the site was expanded with building work and the acquisition of neighbouring property. By 1760, it was known simply as the Westminster Hospital, as it remained for the rest of its existence. =Broad Sanctuary site= In 1831, a new site at the Broad Sanctuary opposite Westminster Abbey was acquired, and a new and spacious hospital building was completed and opened in 1834, of an embattled quasi-Gothic character, erected by Messrs. Inwood at a cost of ¬£40,000. The hospital was situated by the Broad Sanctuary and the northern side of the nave of Westminster Abbey, between the Sessions House and Victoria Street, and accommodated about 200 in-patients, and the total number of patients relieved annually, in an 1878 account, was about 20,000. According to the same 1878 description, \\"Patients are admitted by order from a governor, except in cases of accident, which are received, without recommendation, at all hours of the day or night\\". It was the first subscription hospital erected in London, and was incorporated in 1836.Westminster: King St, Great George St and the Broad Sanctuary in Old and New London: Volume 4 (1878), pp. 26‚Äì35, from British History Online The original building was substantially rebuilt in 1895, and a clinical laboratory was opened by Lord Lister in 1899. In 1924, the Westminster Hospital closed for one year while the building was substantially refurbished. =Move to Pimlico= In 1938, the Westminster Hospital moved again. The new building was in St John's Gardens, Westminster, and included The Queen Mary Nurses' Home (sleeping 250) and a Training School, both opened in 1938, followed in 1939 by the opening of the new Westminster Hospital building opposite, in Horseferry Road. The new building was hit by bombs in 1940 and suffered from a nearby landmine explosion in 1941, but continued to operate. Upon the foundation of the National Health Service in 1948, the Westminster Hospital was placed in a new \\"Westminster Group of Hospitals\\", which included, also, the Gordon Hospital, the Westminster Children's Hospital and the All Saints' Hospital. In 1950, they were joined by Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton, bringing the total number of beds in the Westminster Group to 1,090. The Wolfson School of Nursing was built in Vincent Square in 1960, and a new wing for the hospital building, linked by a bridge, was opened in 1966. In 1990, the Westminster Hospital had 403 beds. =Transfer to the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital= In 1992, the Westminster Hospital closed, and in 1993 re-opened, as the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, in a new purpose-built building in Fulham Road. As well as the name, continuity is provided by portraits from the old building which hang in the Board Room of the new; together with a Veronese painting in the new hospital chapel and some of the stained-glass there. Meanwhile, the old buildings were converted into luxury flats called Westminster Green, which preserve the fa√ßade of the original hospital building. The previous buildings in Broad Sanctuary survived until destroyed by a fire in 1950; the Queen Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, in a completely different style, now stands on the site. Famous patients Malvina Longfellow (1889‚Äì1962), a silent movie actress of the 1920s, died at the Hospital on 2 November 1962, having been admitted from her flat in South Street, Mayfair.\\"Cunliffe, Malvina Virginia\\", in Probate Index for 1962 at probatesearch.service.gov.uk, accessed 6 August 2016 The Conservative Member of Parliament Airey Neave died at the hospital on 30 March 1979, after being badly wounded by a car bomb as he drove out of the nearby House of Commons that day. Ernest Tidyman, American author of Shaft and Academy Award winning screenwriter of The French Connection, also died in Westminster Hospital on 14 July 1984 of a perforated ulcer and complications.

Structure  A Reverse Morris Trust is used when a parent company has a subsidiary (sub-company) that it wants to sell in a tax- efficient manner. The parent company completes a spin-off of a subsidiary to the parent company's shareholders. Under Internal Revenue Code section 355, this could be tax-free if certain criteria are met. The former subsidiary (now owned by the parent company's shareholders, but separate from the parent company) then merges with a target company to create a merged company. Under Internal Revenue Code section 368(a)(1)(A), this transaction could be largely tax-free if the former subsidiary is considered the \\"buyer\\" of the target company. The former subsidiary is the \\"buyer\\" if its shareholders (also the original parent company's shareholders) own more than 50% of the merged company.  History  The original Morris Trust structure was the result of a favorable ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in 1966 in the case of Commissioner v. Mary Archer W. Morris Trust.367 F.2d 794 (4th Cir. 1966), at . The original Morris Trust structure is similar to the above Reverse Morris Trust structure. Instead of a former subsidiary merging with a target company, however, the parent company would merge with the target company. Following several leveraged Morris Trust transactions similar to the original Morris Trust transaction, but involving cash and bank loans rather than mere stock, Congress enacted Internal Revenue Code Section 355(e) in 1997.Section 355(e), added by section 1012(a) of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, Public Law No. 105-34 (Aug. 5, 1997), generally effective for certain distributions after April 16, 1997; see also section 6010(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, Public Law No. 105-206, 112 Stat. 685 (July 22, 1998). This provision imposes additional taxation on the distribution in the spin-off step whenever a 50% interest in a spun off company is transferred tax-free in the two years following a spin- off.  Examples  Verizon wished to sell its access lines to FairPoint Communications, Inc. Rather than simply selling these assets to Fairpoint, Verizon created a subsidiary to which it sold these assets. Verizon distributed the shares of this new subsidiary to Verizon's shareholders. The parties then completed a Reverse Morris Trust with Fairpoint, where the original Verizon shareholders had a majority ownership of the newly merged company and the Fairpoint management ran the new company. Verizon was able to divest their access lines in a tax-free manner and continued to focus on higher growth wireless business. Procter & Gamble Co. was planning to sell its Pringles line of snacks to Diamond Foods Inc. in a leveraged, reverse Morris Trust split-off. The Pringles business was to be transferred to a separate subsidiary which would assume approximately $850 million of debt. The two companies were unable to finalize the deal and, in February 2012, Procter & Gamble found another buyer in the Kellogg Company. Procter & Gamble used a similar transaction structure when it sold Folgers coffee to J.M. Smucker in 2008. Procter & Gamble used the same transaction structure with the sale of 43 of its beauty brands on July 9, 2015 to Coty, Inc. Lockheed Martin divested a portion of its IS&GS; business to Leidos in a $5 billion transaction in early 2016. The transaction included a $1.8 billion one-time special cash payment to Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin shareholders received 50.5% equity in Leidos. On February 2, 2017, Entercom announced that it had agreed to acquire CBS Radio. The sale was conducted using a Reverse Morris Trust so that it was tax- free.

It forms a one-way pair of streets with Lombard Street that run west‚Äìeast through downtown Baltimore. For most of their route, Pratt Street is one-way in an eastbound direction, and Lombard Street is one way westbound. Both streets begin in west Baltimore at Frederick Avenue and end in Butcher's Hill at Patterson Park Avenue. Since 2005, these streets have been open to two-way traffic from Broadway until their end at Patterson Park. Although Lombard is also a two-way street from Fulton Avenue to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, Pratt is still one-way eastbound in this area. To the east of Patterson Park, both Pratt and Lombard Streets start again. Pratt continues as a side street from Linwood Avenue until Haven Street. Pratt Street has historic significance as the location of the Baltimore Riot of 1861. Today it is known for being an important gateway into the Inner Harbor, connecting it with the Baltimore Light Rail line. It is for the latter reason that the city decided to redesign the street and surrounding area to be more pedestrian-friendly. Pratt Street is named for Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden a supporter of Civil liberties in the 18th Century, and not the noted Baltimorean Enoch Pratt (1808-1896). Pratt Street appears on maps of Baltimore as early as 1801.

While many details remain unclear, many claim that she took the decision to follow the ancient custom and died on the funeral pyre of her husband, while the general feeling is that she was forced by the villagers onto the pyre, perhaps after having been given some sedatives. After she had burnt to death, the place was converted into a memorial and thousands of people from surrounding regions started visiting it, though afterwards the area was sealed in order not to promote sati as a legitimate action, and to prevent similar incidents happening in the future.

A second recording, released on the Decca label in 1947, was spoken and sung by Danny Kaye and later featured on his Hans Christian Andersen album, along with the sequel, Tubby the Tuba at the Circus. The song traces its origins back to World War II, following the attack on Pearl Harbor. After Tripp and Kleinsinger performed their first musical piece, the tuba player quipped: \\"You know, tubas can sing, too.\\" With this in mind, Tripp wrote the tale of a tuba who found a melody to play, and the pair then made a song out of it.History of \\"Tubby the Tuba\\" at official site.

Betts attended the University of Liverpool, where he read English Literature and English Language, and originally trained to become an actor but later changed course to begin writing plays. Betts stated that part of the reason for this transition was the difficulty he faced as an actor without an agent and that playwriting allowed him to \\"exercise all my instincts as an actor without actually having to live the life\\". In 1999 Alan Ayckbourn invited him to be the resident dramatist at Scarborough's Stephen Joseph Theatre. A Listening Heaven premiered there that year before a second production took place at the Edinburgh Royal Lyceum in 2001. The play was nominated as the TMA Best New play that year. During this period Betts was enjoying success on the London fringe at the Battersea Arts Centre with plays like Incarcerator, a drama in rhyming couplets and The Biggleswades at the White Bear Theatre Club. Also in that year (2001), his play Clockwatching initiated a series of co-productions between the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond and The Stephen Joseph Theatre, producing theatre in the round. Betts works in two very distinct styles: a darkly comic social realism, reminiscent of the plays of Ayckbourn or Mike Leigh, and a more tragic, poetic style of a kind associated with dramatists such as Howard Barker. His brutal anti-Blair satire The Unconquered, in a touring production by Scotland's Stellar Quines Theatre Company, won the 2007 Best New Play award at the Critics' Awards for Theatre in Scotland. Critical reception for Betts's plays has been mostly very positive: The Daily Telegraph claims he has a \\"profound and highly original theatrical voice\\", while Liz Lochhead (the former makar or national poet of Scotland) suggests he \\"is just about the most original and extraordinary writer of drama we have.\\" Michael Billington in his **** Guardian review of Invincible commented that \\"Torben Betts should be a bigger name.\\" Invincible played at the Orange Tree Theatre March/April 2014 to great critical and popular acclaim and is the fourth of his plays to premiere at that theatre, following Clockwatching (2001), The Company Man (2010) and Muswell Hill (2012). The production transferred to London's St. James Theatre in July 2014, again receiving glowing reviews across the board (see the review in the London Evening Standard, Paul Taylor's review and Alice Jones' interview with the playwright also in the Independent). He also wrote the screenplay for the British independent feature film Downhill, which was released in cinemas nationwide on 30 May 2014. The Independent said \\"his screenplay for this engaging, quintessentially British road/rambling movie combines knockabout comedy with surprisingly bleak observations.\\" A revival of his acclaimed 2012 play Muswell Hill transferred to London's Park Theatre in February 2015, while his political tragedy, centring on the 2015 General Election, (What Falls Apart) opened at Newcastle's Live Theatre in April of that year. A production of his version of Anton Chekhov's The Seagull opened at Regent's Park Open Air Theatre on 24 June 2015, directed by Matthew Dunster. (See the review in Time Out.) He has also adapted Get Carter for Northern Stage, Newcastle, where it opened in February 2016, garnering 4- and 5-star reviews. See Betts' article about adapting the Ted Lewis novel in the Independent and the Guardian review. The Original Theatre Company embarked on a four-month UK tour of Invincible in 2016, which it remounted in 2017. His political tragi-comedy (The National Joke), directed by Henry Bell, played in rep at the Stephen Joseph Theatre over the summer of 2016. See the BBC's interview with the playwright, June 2016. A major tour of Invincible (in Spanish Invencible) took place throughout Spain over 2016/17, including runs at the Teatro Arriaga in Bilbao and at the Teatros del Canal in Madrid. The production starred Maribel Verdu and Pilar Castro and was directed by Daniel Veronese. The play was remounted in September 2019 with the same cast. In 2017 the play was produced in New York, Argentina and the Czech Republic. On 3 December 2017 a major production opened at the Teatr 6.pietro in Warsaw, directed by Eugeniusz Korin. Another production opened in Gdansk in the summer of 2019. Further productions in 2020 are taking place in Athens, Ostrava, Lima, Buenos Aires and Santiago. In November/December 2017 the off-Broadway company the Barrow Group produced the US premiere of his 2012 play Muswell Hill. His most recent play Monogamy toured the UK before a five-week run at London's Park Theatre in June/July 2018. It starred Janie Dee, Patrick Ryecart, Charlie Brooks and Genevieve Gaunt. A second UK tour of the play (revised and retitled as Caroline's Kitchen) took place in the first half of 2019 before taking part in the Brits- off-Broadway Festival. The remount starred Caroline Langrishe, Aden Gillett, James Sutton and Jasmyn Banks. The play opened at Teatr Wzpolczesny in Warsaw on 18 January 2020.

It was led by Pak Hon-yong. The party was outlawed by the U.S. occupation authorities due to the party being an aggravating opposition to South Korea and the US, but the party organized a network of clandestine cells and was able to obtain a considerable following. It had around 360 000 party members. In 1947 the party initiated armed guerrilla struggle. As the persecution of party intensified, large sections of the party leadership moved to Pyongyang. The party was opposed to the formation of a South Korean state. In February‚ÄìMarch 1948 it instigated general strikes in opposition to the plans to create a separate South Korean state. On April 3, 1948 the party led a popular uprising on Jeju island, against the unilateral declaration of the foundation of the Republic of Korea. In the suppression of the revolt, thousands of islanders were killed (see Jeju massacre). In one of its first official acts, the South Korean National Assembly passed the National Traitors Act in September 1948, which among other measures, outlawed the Workers' Party of South Korea. On June 30, 1949 the party merged with the Workers' Party of North Korea, forming the Workers' Party of Korea.KBS WORLD Radio The WPNK leader Kim Il-sung became party chairman, whereas Pak Hon-yong became deputy chairman.

It can be used to decide whether a particular vector is a codeword and is also used in decoding algorithms. Definition Formally, a parity check matrix, H of a linear code C is a generator matrix of the dual code, C‚ä•. This means that a codeword c is in C if and only if the matrix-vector product (some authorsfor instance, would write this in an equivalent form, cH‚ä§ = 0.) The rows of a parity check matrix are the coefficients of the parity check equations. That is, they show how linear combinations of certain digits (components) of each codeword equal zero. For example, the parity check matrix :H = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{cccc} 0&0&1&1 1&1&0&0 \\\\end{array} \\\\right] , compactly represents the parity check equations, :\\\\begin{align} c_3 + c_4 &= 0  c_1 + c_2 &= 0 \\\\end{align}, that must be satisfied for the vector (c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4) to be a codeword of C. From the definition of the parity-check matrix it directly follows the minimum distance of the code is the minimum number d such that every d - 1 columns of a parity-check matrix H are linearly independent while there exist d columns of H that are linearly dependent. Creating a parity check matrix The parity check matrix for a given code can be derived from its generator matrix (and vice versa). If the generator matrix for an [n,k]-code is in standard form : G = \\\\begin{bmatrix} I_k  P \\\\end{bmatrix}, then the parity check matrix is given by : H = \\\\begin{bmatrix} -P^{\\\\top}  I_{n-k} \\\\end{bmatrix}, because : G H^{\\\\top} = P-P = 0. Negation is performed in the finite field Fq. Note that if the characteristic of the underlying field is 2 (i.e., 1 + 1 = 0 in that field), as in binary codes, then -P = P, so the negation is unnecessary. For example, if a binary code has the generator matrix : G = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{ccccc} 1&0&1&0&1  0&1&1&1&0  \\\\end{array} \\\\right], then its parity check matrix is : H = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{ccccc} 1&1&1&0&0  0&1&0&1&0  1&0&0&0&1  \\\\end{array} \\\\right]. It can be verified that G is a k \\\\times n matrix, while H is a (n-k) \\\\times n matrix. Syndromes For any (row) vector x of the ambient vector space, s = Hx‚ä§ is called the syndrome of x. The vector x is a codeword if and only if s = 0. The calculation of syndromes is the basis for the syndrome decoding algorithm.

Although massively outnumbered, the Israeli forces managed to hold their positions and on the fourth day of the battle the Syrians withdrew, just as the Israeli defenses were almost at the point of collapse. Background An Israeli An Israeli Sho't Kal, an upgraded Centurion tank On Rosh Hashana eve, the Israeli 7th Brigade was ordered to move one battalion to the Golan Heights to strengthen the Barak Armored Brigade, under the command of Yitzhak Ben Shoham. The brigade commander Avigdor Ben-Gal concluded that something would happen on Yom Kippur. He ordered his artillery troops to survey the area and prepare targets and firing tables. He held a meeting with his battalion commanders to go over the main points of the operational plans that were previously implemented in the Israeli Northern Command. Without notifying his superiors, he took them on a tour of the front line. By 12:00 on Yom Kippur, 6 October, the brigade was concentrated in the Nafakh area.Herzog (1975), p. 66. Nafakh was an important military base at the junction of the Petroleum Road, which crosses diagonally the northern Golan Heights, and a road which leads down to the strategic Bnot Yaakov Bridge over the Jordan River and into northern Israel. Israeli Intelligence estimated that Syria had more than 900 tanks and 140 batteries of artillery immediately behind the Syrian line. The Syrian 7th Division was one of the units ready to attack. The actual number of Syrian tanks was about 1,260. Each Syrian infantry division had one infantry brigade, one mechanized infantry brigade, and one armored brigade. The infantry and mechanized infantry brigades each had three infantry battalions, a battalion of forty tanks, an AA artillery battalion and a field artillery battalion. The armored brigade had three battalions of forty tanks each. The division also had a regiment of division field artillery, a divisional AA field artillery regiment, a reconnaissance regiment with a company attached to each brigade and a chemical company with a section attached to each brigade. The total force of the division was about 10,000 men, 200 tanks, 72 artillery pieces and 72 anti-aircraft guns and SAMs. The 7th Division, under the command of Brigadier-General Omar Abrash, had about 80% of its tanks and APCs. There were also independent armored brigades with about 2,000 men and 120 tanks each.Dupuy (2002), pp. 440-41. One of the independent brigades attached to Abrash's division was a Moroccan brigade.Asher and Hammel (1987), p. 275 In the rear were the 1st and 3rd Armored Divisions, with 250 tanks each. The Syrian attack force was backed by at least 1,000 artillery pieces.Boyne (2002), p.36 The Syrian plan was for the 7th Division to break through near Ahmadiyeh in the north while the 5th Division did the same near Rafid in the south. This would lead to the double envelopment of most of the Israeli forces in the Golan. Each division was to advance in two echelons, the 7th Division to strike westward through El Rom and Wassett while the 5th Division advanced to the Arik Bridge north of the Kinneret.Dupuy (2002), p. 442. If the 5th Division broke through, or if both the 5th and 7th did, the 1st Division would drive between the 5th and 9th for Nafakh to attack the Israeli forces caught between the pincers of the 5th and 7th.Dupuy (2002), p. 443. The Israeli forces in the Golan were 170 tanks and 60 artillery pieces divided between the 7th and the Barak brigades. Prelude At 10:00 on Yom Kippur, Ben-Gal and other brigade commanders convened with General Yitzhak Hofi in Nafakh, where Hofi told them that Intelligence was estimating the Syrians would attack that day, at around 18:00. The 7th Brigade was assigned as a reserve force around Nafakh and was to prepare for a counterattack in either the north or south sector, or to split and support both. Ben-Gal then drove to meet one battalion in Sindiana and address the officers. He called an orders group at Nafakh for 14:00, assuming it would give his second Battalion enough time to organize. As they gathered to wait for him, the Syrian artillery and planes began to attack. Ben-gal's men ran back to their battalions while Ben-Gal moved the headquarters out of the camp. After an hour, he was ordered to move to the northern sector in the Kuneitra area and to transfer the 2nd battalion to the southern sector, under command of the Barak Brigade. The 7th Brigade was left in charge of the northern sector from Kuneitra northwards with two battalions.Herzog (1975), pp. 66-67 As part of his usual strategy, Ben-Gal decided to maintain a reserve force, and began building a third battalion. He transferred a company from one battalion and placed it under the command of his armored infantry battalion, thus creating a third battalion framework with tanks. With reinforcements, the new battalion gradually became a proper one: Ben-Gal now had three battalions available for maneuvering purposes. He received Lieutenant-Colonel Yair Nafshi's 74th Battalion, which was in the line with the fortifications in the northern sector. With Nafshi's battalion, the brigade had about 100 tanks. The first battalion was stationed on the Purple Line. The line began at the fortification A1, directly east of Mas'ade on the foothills of Mount Hermon, and ran south about six kilometres to Mount Hermonit.Herzog (1975), p. 67 Valley of Tears in 2010 Battle =First day= At 13:55, while Nafshi's sector came under a heavy artillery barrage, several soldiers along the Purple Line reported that the Syrians were removing the camouflage nets from their tanks and artillery. Ben Shoham ordered his battalion commanders, Nafshi and Oded Erez, to deploy their nearly seventy Centurion tanks in prepared battle positions.Asher and Hammel (1987), p. 81 Nafshi was at Kuneitra when the order came to deploy his platoons and move his headquarters somewhere safer. He immediately ordered his troops to leave the town, and the tanks to advance while the soft vehicles fell back. Erez's 53rd Battalion was moved to the southern Golan.Asher and Hammel (1987), p. 82 One of Nafshi's platoons of three tanks was near the Wassett crossroads when Syrian jets attacked Tel Abu Nida. When the jets departed, the crews began moving to the bunker line. After one kilometre, they came under large-caliber artillery fire. Before 14:00, Nafshi reported to his brigade headquarters that his battalion was ready for combat and was manning the Booster ridge.Asher and Hammel (1987), p. 85 The Syrian 85th Infantry Brigade assault column reached the Israeli anti-tank ditch before its officers noticed that the engineers were not in the vanguard. They decided to dismount tank crewmen and mechanized infantrymen and rush them on foot to improvise crossings. This halted the attack in full Israeli view and exposed the men to Israeli fire.Asher and Hammel (1987), p. 91 Nafshi ordered his men to destroy the bridging tanks. During the afternoon the Israelis destroyed most of the Syrian bridging tanks within sight, putting them out of action with shots fired at a range of . Only two of the bridging tanks managed to reach the anti-tank ditch north of A3. The Syrians threw two bridges and a company of ten tanks crossed the ditch. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) was called into action, but many planes were shot down. The first close combat commenced in the 74th Battalion's northernmost sector, against the Moroccan Brigade of thirty tanks. One Israeli Centurion was hit, and an Israeli platoon that was sent northward to guard the Dan Road was caught between the Moroccans moving against Tel Shaeta and a Syrian battalion closing in from the west. Avner Landau's company, now with seven Centurions, was also threatened and could not help. Nafshi delegated the area north of Hermonit to his deputy, Major Yosef Nissim, and reinforced the sector with Captain Eyal Shaham's company, leaving a company from the Armor School Tank Battalion as a tactical reserve. In forty minutes, every Barak Brigade Centurion in the northern Golan was committed.Asher and Hammel (1987), p. 92 Nissim ordered Shaham to reinforce the trapped platoon around Tel Shaeta, and ordered his deputy, Lieutenant Asaf Sela, to cover the area south of Tel Shaeta, which could provide easy access to Hermonit, with one platoon. The Moroccans continued to fire at Tel Shaeta, but did not advance, and the Syrian battalion was stopped when its leading vehicles were destroyed on the roadway. The Syrian battalion commander decided to move southward and try to penetrate between the Dan Road and Hermonit. He was unaware that he was moving between the forces of Shaham and Sela, who prepared a trap. They opened fire just before 15:00, using superior positions. After a little more than two hours, the Syrians withdrew, leaving behind their bridging tanks, a bulldozer tank, two BRDMs and six main battle tanks. Shaham's company lost two Centurions. Just before nightfall, Shaham noticed three SU-100 gun carriers and a truck close to Nissim's position, from which Nissim could not engage them. Shaham directed Sela, who could not see the Syrians, to intercept them. Sela, accompanied by one other Centurion, opened fire at the rear of the Syrian force and destroyed them at a range of 200 to 300 meters.Asher and Hammel (1987), pp. 92-93 Two Syrian tanks attempted to cross the open ground to the anti-tank ditch in the unguarded area south of Nissim's sector. The Syrian companies began moving toward that area, hoping to cross just before nightfall.Asher and Hammel (1987), p. 93 As darkness fell, Nafshi ordered one company to move forward towards the Syrian bridges across the ditch to destroy the tanks that had crossed. The Syrian company that crossed was hit by Landau's tanks and destroyed after half an hour. The bridgehead was sealed.Asher and Hammel (1987), p. 94 In late afternoon, Hofi decided that the Barak Brigade's 65 tanks could not contain the Syrian attack alone, and committed the 7th Brigade's 105 Centurions. Believing that the northern sector was more crucial than the southern sector because of the Kuneitra Gap, he ordered Ben Gal to assume command of the area from Bunker 107 northward. The Barak Brigade was now put in charge of the southern sector, already occupied by Erez's 53rd Battalion. The 74th Battalion was transferred to the 7th Brigade, while the newly arrived 82nd Battalion, under the command of Captain Meir \\"Tiger\\" Zamir, and two companies from the newly arrived 75th Armored Infantry Battalion from the 7th Brigade to the Barak Brigade. Avigdor Kahalani's 77th Battalion, which was familiar with the terrain after having worked there for a week, was returned to the 7th Brigade. Ben Gal decided to create a personal reserve by attaching one company of the 82nd Battalion to the 7th Brigade's headquarters. After an hour, the 82nd Battalion was transferred to the Barak Brigade.Asher and Hammel (1987), pp. 106-107 By nighttime, Nafshi was placed under the command of the 7th Brigade. The Syrians kept advancing in columns, using colored lights and flags to distinguish units. Some of them struck Israeli minefields. The Israeli forces did not have adequate optical equipment for night fighting, and had to gauge the position of the Syrian forces by their noise and artillery flares. Nafshi's battalion kept changing positions to avoid tank hunters. The fortifications were under heavy attack by tanks and infantry and were calling for help. Nafshi told them to go underground and provided them with supporting artillery fire.Herzog (1975), p. 79 Abrash committed his division's 78th Armored Brigade in the northern sector at 22:00. He was behind schedule, but expected to make up for it if the 78th Brigade could reach and secure the Kuneitra-Mas'ade Road, four and a half kilometres west of its starting line. It was believed that achieving this mission would cause the Israeli defenses to collapse. Each of the 82nd Brigade's ninety-five T-55 tanks was equipped with a specially designed infrared nightscope. The night was brightly moonlit.Asher and Hammel (1987), pp. 140-141 The 82nd Brigade moved up the valley just two and a half kilometres from the Kuneitra-Masada Road. Ben Gal used his artillery for illumination, and ordered his men to remain silent until the Syrians were well within range. By 22:00, the Syrian tanks were within 800 meters of the Israeli positions. Both sides lost tanks to the terrain. Captain Yair Swet, a 77th Battalion company commander, was ordered to move to Booster and lost two tanks as a result. One crew managed to extricate its tank and use it to pull the other, but the delay distracted the battalion.Asher and Hammel (1987), p. 142 Lieutenant-Colonel Yosef Eldar, commander of the 75th Armored infantry Battalion and responsible for the area penetrated by the 78th Brigade, was wounded, and Ben Gal ordered Kahalani to assume responsibility. At this point, Kahalani's companies were scattered across seventeen kilometres between Hermonit and Bunker 109. One Syrian tank was discovered only after Kahalani ordered one of the companies to turn off their lights. A Syrian anti-tank unit tried to advance down the Bnot Yaakov Road, in front of Bunker 107, not knowing it was occupied. The Israelis opened fire and after a brief battle the Syrians retreated. The 78th Brigade and its supporting units hunkered down.Asher and Hammel (1987), pp. 143-144 Some may surmise this was due to the swift reaction time of the Israeli crews compared to the Syrian tank crews. As the Israeli's were often firing at least two or more shells to the Syrians one, this would prove a major factor in offsetting the disparity of the forces.Abraham Rabinovich (2004), pp. 148 =Second day= On the dawn of 7 October, the area between Hermonit and Booster was named \\"Valley of Tears\\" because of the great number of burning tanks lying across it.Herzog (1975), p. 106 At 07:00, Israeli Skyhawks began flying over the southern Golan. The first four came down from the southwest and within seconds, they were hit by Syrian surface-to-air missiles (SAM). Several minutes later, another foursome approached and two were shot down.Rabinovich (2005), p. 185 At 08:00, the 78th Tank Brigade of the 7th Division launched a second attack. It advanced along a 4 kilometre wide front in the valley in the direction of Wassett. The 75th Battalion was fighting a Syrian brigade, at ranges varying from . Meanwhile, the 74th Battalion in the north was attacked by two Syrian battalions, supported by an armored infantry force in APCs, most of which were destroyed.Herzog (1975), pp. 106-107 The Syrian objective in this attack was a wadi running in the direction of Wassett along the base of Hermonit. Shaham was killed just before 13:00, a short time before the Syrians withdrew.Asher and Hammel (1987), p. 191 The 77th Battalion was moved from south of Kuneitra to the central sector at Hermonit. Kahalani was ordered to leave a small force to the south to protect the brigade flank. The 74th Battalion, having lost about ten tanks, remained in the north. The company Kahalani left behind was attacked in the afternoon, but the attacking Syrian force of about twenty tanks was destroyed.Herzog (1975), p. 107 The 7th Brigade lost three company commanders in the morning fighting, and over a dozen tanks were damaged or destroyed, none of which were replaced. Late in the day, Ben Gal met with Kahalani and Eldar, who was wounded, on the southern slope of Booster to review the events. Meanwhile, Kahalani's deputy, Major Eitan Kauli, supported the forces fighting in that sector. With troops from the 75th Battalion, he began rearming, refueling, and salvaging tanks and APCs. Three Centurions at a time were withdrawn from the front-line positions and worked over at Wassett. This gave the crewmen a chance to eat, drink, and rest, and improved the brigade's morale.Asher and Hammel (1987), p. 192 The Syrians attacked the central sector again at 22:00 with artillery. The 7th Division was joined by the 64th and 66th Field Artillery Regiments with the 81st Brigade, led by T-62 tanks, which were turned over from the General Headquarters to allow Abrash to mount a new offensive around the Tapline-Wassett crossroads in the north- central Golan. The 81st Brigade arrived five hours after it was ordered out of the Kiswe, Syria Military Base. With 400 artillery pieces, the 85th Infantry Brigade was to commit a company each of tanks and infantry to its divisional northern sector. The 78th and 81st Brigades were to commit over a hundred infantry-supported tanks in the divisional central sector, and the 121st Mechanized Brigade was to press some of its assault on Kuneitra with the help of BRDM-mounted Sagger anti-tank missiles. All units were to be equipped with anti-tank weapons, mostly RPGs. In total, about 500 tanks were to attack at 22:00.Asher and Hammel (1987), pp. 193-194 Nafshi's force of five tanks at Bunker 107 was the first to report the new Syrian attack. Given the small size of his force, Nafshi's position was vulnerable when faced with this heavy attack, and his tank's turret was damaged. He decided to allow the T-62s to close in on his position in order to reduce the Syrian advantages of numbers and night-vision. Close to 22:00, the Syrians approached within 450 meters of the bunker. He hit two tanks and whispered commands through his microphone. After four minutes, 25 Syrian tanks were destroyed and their attack disturbed. Nafshi's force suffered no casualties. Most of the Syrian artillery fire fell on the Israeli units in the north. Kahalani warned his men to remain on the lookout for antitank squads.Asher and Hammel (1987), pp. 194-195 The Israeli brigade, with fewer than 40 tanks, was facing approximately 500 Syrian tanks. Due to the Israelis' lack of night-fighting equipment, the Syrians reached within close range, and a battle commenced at ranges of . The Syrian tanks and commandos bypassed the Israelis and destroyed many tanks with RPGs. At 01:00, the Syrians retreated, trying to evacuate damaged tanks and wounded. Ben-Gal struck the area with artillery and used the interval to refuel and reload. At 04:00, the Syrians renewed their attacks. This time, they attacked mainly with artillery and did not renew any major tank assaults. Only in the 7th Brigade's southern sector, the 7th Syrian Division 121st Mechanized Brigade was able to hold on.Asher and Hammel (1987), p. 196 At dawn, 130 Syrian tanks and many APCs were lying in the valley, many of them behind or between the Israeli positions. During the night, two Syrian infantry battalions attacked the position on Hermonit and were fought off by fewer than twenty Israeli infantry troops from the Golani Brigade. Dozens of bodies were left lying on the battlefield.Herzog (1975), pp. 107-108 =Third day= On 8 October, the 7th Brigade fought against elements of the 7th Infantry Division, the 3rd Armored Division and independent units, including the Assad Republican Guard. On the brigade's southern flank, Zamir's company fought an armored force that had entered the area during the night. Zamir's force of seven tanks held the attack and eliminated about thirty Syrian tanks, two APC companies and twenty vehicles. In the afternoon, three individual Syrian tank battalion concentrations with armored infantry tried to break through in the Hermonit area. The Syrian artillery identified the Israeli positions and inflicted most of its casualties. The 7th Brigade lost about 50 dead and many wounded, and were left with fewer than 45 working tanks. Ben-Gal decided to create a reserve of five tanks under the command of his operations officer, whom he ordered to move back about half a kilometre away and prepare to block a Syrian breakthrough.Herzog (1975), p. 108 At dusk, Abrash's tank was hit just as he was getting it ready for a new attack, and he was killed.Dupuy (2002), p. 457 At night, the Syrians attacked the central sector towards Booster. Ben-Gal ordered Zamir's company to counterattack from the flank and the rear of the enemy. Zamir's seven tanks managed to break the attack.Herzog (1975), pp. 108-109 =Fourth day= Abandoned Syrian T-62 tanks on the Golan Heights. A destroyed Syrian T-55 tank at Nafakh on the Golan Heights. The Northern Command was trying to put together a command reserve, but could only assemble the survivors of the 53rd Battalion. The Barak Brigade had almost ceased to exist: Its commander and key staff officers were dead, and almost all of its troops and equipment were absorbed into other brigades. Lieutenant-Colonel Yossi Ben Hanan arrived the night before to take command of what was left of it. He had been the commander of the 53rd Battalion until two weeks earlier, and was on his honeymoon when the war started. He was sent to reorganize the brigade. He teamed with Erez, who had escaped from Tel Faris on Monday morning, and Shmuel Askarov, the 53rd Battalion's deputy commander, to start repairing tanks.Asher and Hammel (1987), pp. 232-233 At 1800, he reported to his division commander, General Rafael Eitan that he was ready to bring forward the thirteen Centurions he had repaired thus far, and was ordered to head for Nafakh. He was on his way when the IAF confirmed that about 100 Syrian tanks were headed toward the 7th Brigade's sector. One air photo depicted a complete Syrian battalion of thirty-eight T-62s and four BMPs.Asher and Hammel (1987), p. 234 At dawn on 9 October, the Syrians launched the heaviest artillery barrage thus far, using Katyusha rockets and MiG-17s. Seven Syrian helicopters flew over the Israeli positions to Buq'ata, where four of them discharged commando forces. At 08:00, a Syrian force of 100 tanks and a large number of APCs began to advance. The Israelis opened fire at maximum range but the Syrian advance continued. The Israeli commanders were exposed in their turrets and the artillery caused the number of casualties among them to grow significantly. Ben-Gal ordered his force to leave the high ramps and withdraw some to escape the artillery concentrations.Herzog (1975), p. 109 Nafshi was ordered to join the 7th Brigade's area. He entered the battle with six tanks and was hit. He joined another tank and left A3. He ordered all the men under cover and requested Israeli artillery shelling of the position for protection. Later that day, he organized a supply convoy to A3. His tank was hit by a Syrian bazooka near Kuneitra and the tank behind him reported him dead. Nafshi continued with three APCs past Booster and entered A3 with the supplies.Herzog (1975), p. 110 When the 7th Brigade withdrew from the hill, the artillery stopped and Syrian tanks mounted the hill to fire at them. Ben- Gal's 7th Battalion had only six tanks and was acting as a brigade reserve, Nafshi had six tanks, and the operations officer was patrolling Buq'ata for the commandos. Zamir was fighting on Tel Git and was running out of ammunition, so he asked for permission to withdraw and reload. Ben-Gal refused at first, but relented when he was told there was only one shell per tank. Ben-Gal consulted Eitan and decided to counterattack. The 7th Battalion began to move up the hill and saw the Syrian tanks.Herzog (1975), pp. 110-111 Kahalani called the other Israeli tanks behind the ramp and got little response, since they were from different units and were operating on different frequencies. The brigade communications officer cut into every company's net, but they still did not respond to Kahalani. Kahalani's gunner knocked out the Syrian tank at the top of the hill, and another one was hit by an Israeli tank from the rear of the ramp.Rabinovich (2005), pp. 296-297 In the north, the 74th Battalion was fighting with fewer than half its tanks. Ben-Gal feared that it might not be able to hold out, and ordered it to leave three tanks in the sector and move to the northern flank of the battle to face the Assad Republican Guard, which was trying to use the dead ground to move towards El Rom. The battalion commander was killed in this battle. Ben-Gal ordered the 77th Battalion to take command of the 74th Battalion. The 77th Battalion then fought two battalions of T62 tanks that got by the 7th Brigade and were about behind it. The 77th Battalion moved to the high ground around the valley and destroyed the Assad Republican Guard force. All the forces in the central sector, down to only about fifteen tanks, were at this point under Kahalani's command, fighting at ranges of from their original positions on the ramps. The Syrians passed them and fired on them from behind. The 7th Brigade was fighting in all directions. Tanks from both sides got mixed up with the other side and struck by both sides' artillery fire.Herzog (1975), p. 111 Several Syrian Mi-8 helicopters flew over the valley toward El Rom. At this point, Eitan heard that Syrian infantry was approaching Buq'ata, north of El Rom. If the 7th Division were to break through, it could join the infantry force and proceed to Dan and Kiryat Shmona, inside Israel.Dupuy (2002), p. 458 Ben-Gal described the battle to Eitan and told him he was not sure he could hold on. Eitan asked him to hold on for another half-hour. At this point, the remaining eleven tanks of the Barak Brigade arrived, and Eitan directed them to Ben- Gal.Herzog (1975), pp. 111-112 Eitan told Ben-Gal of Ben-Hanan's force. Kahalani called Captain Emi Palant, the senior officer behind the ramps, to use a signal flag to get the tank commanders' attention and direct them to the ramp, but waving the flag got no response. Palant fired his machine gun at the side of the nearest tank to get the commander to look out, and the message was passed. He ran from tank to tank and rapped on their turrets to get their attention before returning to his own tank and starting to move forward. No tank followed. Kahalani heard a sergeant from the 74th Battalion and ordered him to take his position and guard the wadi. The sergeant replied he did not have any shells left. Zamir, who was flanking his position to the south, reported a massive Syrian attack and asked for permission to move the remaining tanks to Zamir's company to a better position slightly to the south. Ben-Gal refused. Kahalani reported that he was unable to control the tanks, which kept drifting to the rear. Ben-Gal said he would try to get him more tanks. Kahalani ordered the sergeant to take his place, saying the Syrians would not try to attack if they saw his tank.Rabinovich (2005), p. 298 Kahalani moved towards the tanks behind the rampart and told their commanders to raise their flags if they heard him. He saw ten tanks, and most raised their flags. Two Israeli planes accidentally bombed them, but none of the tanks were hit.Rabinovich (2005), p. 299 On the southern sector, Zamir reported that he was out of ammunition and could no longer hold out on Booster. His force was left with two shells per tank. He radioed Ben-Gal that he could no longer hold on. Ben-Gal asked him for ten more minutes. Zamir's tank ran out of shells, and he began to fill his pockets with grenades and withdraw.Herzog (1975), p. 113 Kahalani reached the tanks behind the ramps and told them they were going to retake the ramp. He started moving and a few other tanks slowly followed. Two Syrian tanks were knocked out, but the tanks behind him began to pull back. Ben-Gal informed him on the radio that several tanks, under the command of Eli Geva, were on their way. Kahalani managed to convince the other tanks to follow him. The tank next to him hit a Syrian tank that came over the ramp. The tanks' hatches were open, and eventually they could see the valley. Syrian tanks were moving forward, away. The Israeli tanks opened fire. Kahalani ordered them to shoot only at moving tanks. Geva's force reached the ramp and joined the battle. The Syrians fired a heavy artillery barrage. When it subsided, Kahalani could see no Syrian tanks moving ahead. Zamir had two tanks left and requested permission to withdraw, but Ben- Gal turned him down. He began to withdraw just as a force from the south, under the command of Ben Hanan, was arriving. Askarov took a position near Ben Hanan and the rest of the unit formed a battle line. Ben Hanan's face was wounded and he passed command to Askarov to get treatment.Rabinovich (2005), pp. 300-301 The force then destroyed about thirty Syrian tanks. The 7th Brigade was left with seven tanks, and Ben-Gal told Eitan he could no longer hold on. Suddenly A3, surrounded by Syrian forces, reported that the Syrian supply trains were turning around and withdrawing. Dennie Agmon, Eitan's intelligence officer, told him that the Syrian General Staff had decided to retreat.Rabinovich (2005), p. 301 The Syrian forces, having lost over 500 tanks and APCs, began to withdraw. Aftermath An abandoned tank in a memorial near the Valley of Tears, Golan Heights The 7th Brigade, including reinforcements, totaled some twenty tanks. It began to pursue the Syrians but stopped at the anti-tank ditch. About 260 tanks were lying in the valley. The Syrians lost over 500 tanks and APCs and the Israelis lost 60 to 80 armored vehicles. One brigade from the 7th Division was taken out of action for three days and then reorganized as a battalion.Pollack (2002), p. 491 Eitan told the 7th Brigade over the radio: \\"You have saved the people of Israel\\". Ben Gal told Kahalani: \\"You are the true savior of the people of Israel\\".Dupuy (2002), p. 459 In the afternoon, the brigade's tanks pulled back a few at a time for ammunition and fuel. Ben Gal told Kahalani that the brigade has been ordered to counterattack into Syria. Eitan asked him to attack the next day, so as not to allow the Syrians time to reorganize, but Ben Gal asked for a day to allow his men to rest and refill the ranks. Kahalani was later awarded the Medal of Valor for his performance in the battle. Decades after the battle, analysts were still presenting differing reasons for the Syrian withdrawal. In 1990, Patrick Seale argued that the reason why the Syrians were stopped was the superiority of the IAF, which was free to devote all of its attention to the Syrian front.Seale (1990), p. 209 In 2002, Kenneth Pollack wrote that the Syrian forces did not look for an alternative axis of advance and rolled forward without defending their flanks.Pollack (2002), p. 506 In 1998, Martin Van Creveld suggested the explanation that on October 8 (though the Syrians did not withdraw until more losses on October 9), when Israel felt that the battle was being lost, it threatened Syria with a nuclear strike.Van Creveld (1998), p. 232 References =Bibliography=   * * =Further reading= * * Category:Battles of the Yom Kippur War Category:Tank battles ","title":"Valley of Tears"},{"id":"10557596","text":"The Lat√©nium is an archeology museum located in Hauterive, a suburb of Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland. Its name refers to the famous nearby site of La T√®ne which gave its name to the Second European Iron age. The Lat√©nium is composed of a park and a museum building which also harbours the archaeological section of the Heritage Offices of the State of Neuch√¢tel, as well as the chair of prehistory of the University of Neuch√¢tel. The museum and its park are built on what used to be three archaeological sites that were excavated during the construction of the A5 motorway. Theses sites date from the Upper Paleolithic, Bronze Age and Neolithic. The park features dolmens and glacial erratics, reconstitutions of prehistoric and antique devices (a La T√®ne house, a Gallo- Roman ship and a Celtic bridge, notably), and modern works of art. The museum displays the Bevaix boat, a Gallo-Roman ship found in Bevaix. Items from periods comprised between the Paleolithic to the Middle Ages are on display, including the remains of a Magdalenian hunting camp.  History  The Lat√©nium is the biggest archaeological museum in Switzerland. The permanent exhibition features around 3000 objects coming from excavations mostly realised in the Canton of Neuch√¢tel. These objects are picked from the 525000 pieces that form the museum's collections and span 50'000 years of Europe's past. = Archaeology in Neuch√¢tel during the 19th and 20th century = During the second half of the 19th century, many lake dwellings were found on the banks of lakes Neuch√¢tel, Bienne and Morat during a period dubbed \\"lake dwellings fever\\" (fi√®vre lacustre in french). The Jura waters correction lowered lake Neuch√¢tel height by 2.7 m which resulted in dozens of lake dwellings sites exiting from the waters. This made access to the artifacts far easier. Later, the construction of the A5 motorway (from Yverdon-les-Bains to Solothurn) alongside the north bank of Lake Neuch√¢tel led to the discovery of about 500'000 artifacts, many of them got included into the museum's collections. = Creation = The concretisation of the idea of a new museum entirely dedicated to archaeology in the canton took 22 years, from the first motion before the Grand Council of Neuch√¢tel to the inauguration of the museum in 2001. It also took the people of the Canton of Neuch√¢tel approval, the projects was accepted with 66% of the votes on June 9, 1996. = Awards = In 2003, the Lat√©nium received the European Museum of the Year Award awarded by the Council of Europe the for its contribution for a better understanding of the european cultural heritage. The Lat√©nium was the first swiss museum to receive the award. In 2018, it received the Medal for archaeological mediation of the International Union for Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences. The Lat√©nium's commitment to the popularisation of archaeology and for the social valorisation of the protection of the cultural heritage got the museum the award.

The store was open for approximately 16 months before failing, and the building is now the Denver laboratory for the medical testing company Quest Diagnostics. The multi-use complex of buildings is now re-purposed under various ownership entities. Early days In its earlier days, the land on which the shopping center was built had two incarnations: Beginning in 1922, Merchants Park sports arena, home of the Denver Bears baseball team; and then later Merchants Park Shopping Center, which opened in 1951, with an appearance by Hopalong CassidyRocky Mountain News, Sept 21, 1951, p.23 The shopping center had a Walgreen Drugs, Miller's Supermarket, and a Joslin's Department Store, which opened on March 21, 1952. North of Merchants Park was a huge warehouse and retailing operation of Montgomery Ward. The Denver Tramway Company's South Division Car Barn was located at Broadway and Alaska Pl. near the Montgomery Ward's site, and was the scene of some of the violent events of the Denver streetcar strike of 1920. Development Broadway Plaza Shopping Center was the idea of Allan S. Reiver, a Denver real estate developer, who had redeveloped a number of historic buildings in downtown Denver. Influenced by the high-flying 1980s, he envisioned Broadway Plaza as a high-end shopping destination, despite it being built in a working class and industrial neighborhood. Reiver's company Realities, Inc. signed a contract to develop Printemps locations around the United States, the first being at Broadway Plaza. Reiver's partner at Broadway Plaza, former Atlantic Richfield Co CEO Robert O. Anderson, played a major part in convincing Printemps to locate in Denver.Denver Post March 31, 1986 p.C-1 Land for the giant project was purchased in 1984 with financing from Red Hill Savings, a division of Hill Financial of Red Hill, Pa. The shopping center was to have three components: Printemps and the International Collection of boutique stores; the Denver Design Center, and an office building renovated from the Montgomery Ward complex. The shopping center opened in late 1986, and by late 1987, numerous smaller stores were closing in the International Collection, despite being offered free rent before the opening of Printemps. Printemps Printemps opened November 6, 1987, and saw much traffic for its beginning months. As business slowed, a double-decker bus was put into operation to shuttle shoppers from downtown. The department store closed in April 1989. Before closing, the owners attempted to sell the Denver franchise itself as well as rights for future stores in the United States. Retailing experts saw the failure of the store as being due to the price point of the merchandise and its location; Cherry Creek Shopping Center, which was being rebuilt at that time, might have been a better location for Printemps; this was a common opinion even before Broadway Plaza was built. The department store, now Quest Diagnostics Restructuring In mid-1988, during the decline of Printemps and high vacancies in the project, Reiver lost control of Broadway Plaza and the Printemps store. Hill Financial forced Reiver to sell his interest in the project to a new partnership, Western Equities, which renamed the project Broadway InterPlaza. The investment at Broadway Plaza was one investment that led to the 1980s S&L; failure of Hill Financial. Today After the department store closed, the space was used for a short period as an event center, before being occupied by Quest Diagnostics. Part of the International Collection is now used by the culinary arts program of the Art Institute of Colorado. The Montgomery Ward building was torn down on February 14, 1993, and replaced by a development called Broadway Marketplace, a collection of big-box retailers, such as Kmart, Office Max, Sam's Club, and an Albertson's (now Safeway) grocery store. Broadway Marketplace was initially developed by Homart (the real estate development arm of Sears), along with the Denver Urban Renewal Authority (DURA). Kmart closed in March 2017. Future In 2009 the Denver City Council approved a General Development Plan for the Denver Design District, by which D4 Urban LLC will create a large transit-oriented development in the original Broadway Plaza area and adjacent properties southwest of Broadway and Alameda Ave. The name \\"Denver Design District\\" is already in use for the Denver Design Center portion.

This may or may not be in addition to other charges. In exchange for the retainer, doctors agree to provide enhanced care, including principally a commitment to limit patient loads to ensure adequate time and availability for each patient.\\"Concierge Medicine: Greater Access for a Fee\\", PBS NewsHour, PBS television, July 9, 2012 The practice has been referred to as concierge medicine, retainer medicine, membership medicine, cash-only practice, and direct care. While all \\"concierge\\" medicine practices share similarities, they vary widely in their structure, payment requirements, and form of operation. In particular, they differ in the level of service provided and the fee charged. Estimates of U.S. doctors practicing concierge medicine range from fewer than 800 to 5,000.  Business model  There are typically three primary types of concierge medicine business models practiced today. Variations of these models exist, although most models usually fall into one of the following categories. The Fee for Care ('FFC') is an annual retainer model, where the patient pays a monthly, quarterly, or annual retainer fee to the physician. The retainer fee covers most services provided by the physician in his/her office. Often, vaccinations, lab work, x-rays, and other services are excluded and charged for separately on a cash basis. The Fee for Extra Care ('FFEC') is similar to the FFC model, however, the additional services are charged to Medicare or the patient's insurance plan. Some of the benefits and services typically included in these two retainer models are: same day access to your doctor; immediate cell phone and text messaging to your doctor; unlimited office visits with no co-pay; little or no waiting time in the office; focus on preventive care; unhurried atmosphere; cell phone, text message, and online consultations; prescription refills; and convenient appointment scheduling. FFC or retainer plans may typically not be purchased with pre-tax dollars utilizing HSA and/or FSA accounts because it is not a fee incurred for a service. Instead, it functions more as an insurance policy where fees are paid in anticipation of an expense. There is also a hybrid concierge model where physicians charge a monthly, quarterly, or annual retainer or membership fee for services that Medicare and insurers do not cover. These services may include: email access; phone consultations; newsletters; annual physicals; prolonged visits; and comprehensive wellness and evaluations plans. For all covered services, these providers will bill Medicare and insurance companies for patient visits and services covered by the plans.\\"Business Models Used In CONCIERGE MEDICINE\\" Concierge Medicine Today, 2011 This model allows the physician to continue to see their non- retainer patients while billing their \\"concierge\\" patients a fee for the increased or \\"special\\" services. Some concierge practices are cash-only or 'direct' primary care practices and do not accept insurance of any kind. In doing so, these practices can keep overhead and administrative costs low, thereby providing affordable healthcare to patients.\\"Cash-Only Healthcare Still Works\\" Physicians Practice Journal, July 2008 Concierge physicians care for fewer patients than those in a conventional practice, ranging from 50 patients per doctor to 1,000, compared to 3,000 to 4,000 patients that the average traditional physician now sees every year.\\"On Panel Size\\" Physicians Practice Journal, June 2005 All generally claim to be accessible via telephone or email at any time of day or night or offer some other service above and beyond the customary care. The annual fees vary widely, ranging, on average, from US$195 to US$5,000 per year for an individual with incremental savings when additional family members are added. The higher priced plans generally include most \\"covered\\" services where the client is not charged additional fees for most services (labs, xrays, etc.). Some of the other benefits of concierge healthcare are: in-home visits, worldwide access to doctors, and expedited emergency room care. An informal one-year summary of findings related to the concierge medicine marketplace in the US was released in February 2010. The summary of the study concluded that at the end of 2009, over 66% of current U.S. concierge physicians operating practices were internal medicine specialists; and the second most popular medical specialty in concierge medicine was family practice. The study also noted that the number of concierge dental and pediatric practices increased markedly since February 2009. In 2004, the Government Accountability Office counted 146 such practices, mostly concentrated on the US east and west coasts with practices such as MDVIP, 1 on 1 MD, and Signature MD being among the oldest. the American Medical Association did not track the number of concierge practices because the concept was so new.\\"Boutique Medicine: When wealth buys health\\", CNN.com, October 19, 2006. Lower-cost concierge medical business models have also been attempted, such as GreenField Health in Portland, Oregon, which charged an annual fee between $195‚Äì$695 depending on age. Another is One Medical Group, the first major low-cost concierge medical group to attempt this model in a large scale, which requests a $199 annual membership fee.\\"Concierge Medical Care With a Smaller Price Tag\\", NYTimes, January 31, 2011.  Vs. direct primary care  Both are variants of the traditional practice of medicine or primary care most common in the United States during the twentieth century. They represent a financial relationship that changes the sole dependency on a traditional insurance model. Direct primary care (DPC) is a term often linked to its companion in health care, 'concierge medicine'. Although the two terms are similar and belong to the same family, 'concierge medicine' encompasses many different health care delivery models, 'direct primary care' being one of them. =Similarities= Direct Primary Care practices, similar in philosophy to their concierge medicine lineage, bypass insurance and go for a more 'direct' financial relationship with patients and also provide comprehensive care and preventive services.\\" CONCIERGE MEDICINE FOR PATIENTS\\" signatureMD =Differences= DPC practices remove one of the financial barriers to accessing care whenever it is needed: the DPC annual fee often includes most or all physician services. This model does not rely on insurance co-pays, deductibles, or co-insurance fees, in contrast to models such as MDVIP and 1 on 1 MD, where the annual fee is structured to cover a wellness planmdvip.com 1 on 1 MD so that doctors may charge insurance or Medicare for most other services. DPC is a mass-market variant of concierge medicine, distinguished by its low prices. Simply stated, the biggest difference between direct primary care and retainer based practices is that DPC takes a flat rate fee whereas models usually charge an annual retainer fee and promise more access to the doctor.  History  The concierge medicine model, although not the term, originated with MD¬≤ International, which was founded in 1996 in Seattle by Dr. Howard Maron and Dr. Scott Hall. At the time, Maron was physician for the Seattle SuperSonics sports team, and sought to provide luxury primary care services similar to what he had been providing these athletes. MD¬≤'s model included physician patient loads of 50 families, dramatically reduced compared with the conventional American patient load of about 3,000 patients per year. Advantages include very quick access to your personal physician as needed, and the ability to see doctors in any of 10 major cities at a greatly increased cost.\\"The Highly Attentive Approach,\\" Worth magazine, July 2005. MD¬≤ clients have insurance to cover additional services beyond primary care, but MD¬≤'s fees cover the full costs of their services and MD¬≤ does not bill insurance. MD¬≤'s approach became widely known very quickly, and many physicians sought to emulate the model in a less costly fashion. MDVIP emerged as a competitor to MD¬≤ with a similar model, but they opted to bill insurance in addition to charging client fees and have patient loads of up to 600. This enabled them to charge substantially lower rates. By 2010, one quarter of all doctors operating with a concierge medicine model were affiliated with MDVIP. In 2017, a new company named Forward, started by former Google and Uber employees with strong venture capital support, began offering concierge medicine services for per month. Common services include 24/7 phone access, same-day appointments, short waiting times, preventative health and wellness services, and accompaniment when seeing specialists or in the emergency room. By 2000, there were a handful of concierge medicine providers in the United States. In 2005, there were about 500 physicians practicing using the model. By 2008, there were over 100,000 people contracting with about 300 physicians. By 2010, there were over 5,000 physicians in over 500 providers using the model. From 2012-2018, the Physicians Foundation has conducted a biennial survey of physicians and found that between 4.5-8.8% plan to switch to a concierge model each time. In 2012, there were 4,400 private physicians ‚Äì a 25% increase from 2011.  Controversy  The concept of concierge medicine has been accused of promoting a two-tiered health system that favors the wealthy,\\"Your Own Private Doctor\\" by Mary Duenwald, Departures magazine, November/December 2004. limits the number of physicians to care for those who cannot afford it, and burdens the middle and lower class with a higher cost of insurance. Detractors contend that while this approach is more lucrative for some physicians and makes care more convenient for their patients, it makes care less accessible for other patients who cannot afford (or choose not) to pay the required membership fees.United States Government Accountability Office, Report to Congressional Committees, \\"Physician Services: Concierge Care and Characteristics and Considerations for Medicare,\\" August 2005. In early 2008, it was reported that one health insurer was dropping from their provider networks some physicians who charge an annual fee. Another insurer also expressed opposition to annual fees. Other insurers do not oppose concierge medicine as long as patients are clearly informed that the fees will not be reimbursed by their health plan.Lynn Cook, \\"Insurers, doctors at odds over 'concierge' care\\", Houston Chronicle, March 13, 2008. In 2003 and 2005, several members of Congress introduced or cosponsored bills that would have prohibited physicians from charging retainer fees. No action was taken, and it appears that no similar bills have been introduced in more recent Congresses. In the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, the Congress directed the GAO to study concierge care and its impact on Medicare patients. The GAO report, published in 2005, concluded that the \\"small number of concierge physicians makes it unlikely that the approach has contributed to widespread access problems\\". In its comments on that report, DHHS noted its agreement with GAO's findings and stated that it would continue to monitor the trend. No specific information is available on monitoring activities.  In popular culture  The USA Network television series Royal Pains focuses on such a doctor's introduction to the practice of concierge medicine. A young doctor becomes a for hire physician for the wealthy residents of the Hamptons. Also on USA Network television series Rush focuses on a doctor who serves a very specific clientele, the kind with a lot of cash and a lot of secrets. The Robin Cook novel Crisis focuses on a medical malpractice trial involving a doctor practicing concierge medicine.

Joining Burgess on the songwriting team was Al Perkins, Kevin McCord, Roslyn Lee, Vee Allen, Jack Hall, Jackie Myers, and long time MCA recording artist Al Hudson of One Way. The album was recorded at United Studio, Detroit, Michigan. Produced by Roy Glover and Al Perkins, the project also included experienced engineer Mike Iacopelli. Following the recording sessions in Detroit, the tapes were handed over to Kevin Gray at MCA's Whitney Recording Studios in Glendale, California for mastering and track listing - the track sequence is thought to have been decided in Detroit. The final result was absolutely incredible. At the time of recording and the release of the finished album, Burgess Gardner was working as a Jazz tutor at the California State University, Fullerton. Music Year 2000 entered the UK's Jazz Fusion Few Chart at Number 1 on 19 April 1983 (Blues and Soul magazine Edition 379), joining the ranks of several acclaimed albums of the day including Lonnie Liston Smith's Dreams of Tomorrow and Earl Klugh's Low Ride. In addition, Burgess's album stood shoulder to shoulder with Joe Sample\\"s The Hunter also on MCA and riding high in the US and UK. Burgess Gardner's first solo album also did well in the US and UK Jazz Charts and the album registered on both US and UK Soul Album charts thanks to the track Shoot Your Best Shot which was being played heavily in clubs on both sides of the atlantic. Shoot Your Best Shot was premiered in the UK as the album's most commercial offer by Robbie Vincent on his Radio London Show in early April when the album was still on pre-release white label promo, with MCA making a decision to put out on a UK 12\\" white label promo single backed with Limited Edition. The official single released by MCA was Nice 'n' Greasy.

Shortly after the demise of Kryah, Tom and James hooked up again in 2006 with Alistair Griffin, as the founding members of Alistair's new band \\"Albion\\",(both leaving after the initial few months to form The Station Club), and also began writing songs for his follow up album to 2004'S \\"Bring It On\\". Some of these songs featured with the second line-up of \\"Albion\\" until \\"Albion\\" Split in 2007. =The Station Club= The Station Club line up with Tom Martin (second L) and James Martin (R) In September 2006 The Station Club was formed. The band was originally a three piece and featured singer/songwriter Mike Wilson, Tom on bass and James on keys, with Adam Swales joining the trio on drums. The band performed their first gig on 16 March 2007 at Fibbers in York. In June 2007 Adam left the band (after their first three live performances) and was quickly replaced by ex- Kryah drummer Dan Chantrey. After three years together, singer Mike Wilson left the band, citing personal reasons. Without a singer the rest of the band decided to take an indefinite sabbatical. Mike Wilson still occasionally writes songs with the twins. =VEGA= They are currently members of melodic rock/AOR band VEGA. VEGA were formed following a meeting between the twins, Nick Workman and Dan Chantry at the Z Rock Festival at JBs in Dudley, May 29/30th 2009. VEGA has released five studio albums to date: *Kiss of Life (2010) Frontiers *What the Hell (2013) Spinefarm Records/Ninetone *Stereo Messiah (2014) Frontiers *Who We Are (2016) Frontiers *Only Human (2018) Frontiers Songwriting During 2002 the twins formed a songwriting team with Alistair Griffin. Writing and producing for Dutch dance star \\"Do\\",(Dominique van Hulst), the most notable collaboration was a ballad called Angel by My Side which featured on her 2004 album \\"Do\\" which reached No. 3 in the Netherlands album charts. The single charted top 10 in The Dutch National Chart and also featured as the title track for Joan Collins film \\"Ellis in Glamourland\\". James and Tom came runner up in Song of the Year on Melodic Rock's Melrock Awards 2006 with \\"Million Miles\\" written for House of Lords. To date, and excluding VEGA, the twins have had around 100 of their songs recorded by rock acts around the world including House of Lords, Danger Danger vocalist Ted Poley, Tommy Funderburk, Khymera and Sunstorm. In April 2010 the twins signed a publishing deal with Chrysalis and are now writing songs for artists signed to the label.

The Apostles appointed successors, known as bishops, and they in turn appointed other bishops in a process known as Apostolic succession. Over time, five Patriarchates were established to organize the Christian world, and four of these ancient Patriarchates remain Orthodox today. Orthodox Christianity reached its present form in Late Antiquity (in the period from the 3rd to the 8th century), when the Ecumenical Councils were held, doctrinal disputes were resolved, the Fathers of the Church lived and wrote, and Orthodox worship practices settled into their permanent form (including the liturgies and the major holidays of the Church). In the early medieval period, Orthodox missionaries spread Christianity towards the north, to the Bulgarians, Serbs, Russians and others. Meanwhile, a gradual process of estrangement took place between the four Eastern Patriarchates and the Latin Church of Rome, culminating with the Great Schism in the 11th century, in which Orthodoxy and the Latin Church (later called the Roman Catholic Church) separated from each other. In the Late Middle Ages, the Fall of Constantinople brought a large part of the world's Orthodox Christians under Ottoman Turkish rule. Nevertheless, Orthodoxy continued to flourish in Russia, as well as within the Ottoman Empire among the latter's Christian subject peoples. As the Ottoman Empire declined in the 19th century and several majority-Orthodox nations regained their independence, they organized a number of new autocephalous Orthodox churches in Southern and Eastern Europe. The Eastern Orthodox jurisdictions with the largest number of adherents in modern times are the Russian and the Romanian Orthodox churches. The most ancient of the Eastern Orthodox communities existing today are the churches of Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, Constantinople, and Georgia.Tomas Spidlik, The Spirituality of the Christian East: A systematic handbook, Cistercian Publications, Kalamazoo, Michigan, 1986. Kallistos Ware, The Orthodox Church, St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, London, 1995. Robert Payne, The Holy Fire: The Story of the Fathers of the Eastern Church, St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1997. Early Christianity =Apostolic era= Christianity first spread in the predominantly Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman Empire. The Apostles traveled extensively throughout the empire, establishing communities in major cities and regions, with the first community appearing in Jerusalem, followed by communities in Antioch, Ethiopia and others. Early growth also occurred in the two political centers of Rome and Greece, as well as in Byzantium (initially a minor centre under the Metropolitan of Heraclea, but which later became Constantinople). Orthodoxy believes in the apostolic succession that they believe was established by the Apostles in the New Testament; this played a key role in the communities' view of itself as the preserver of the original Christian tradition. Historically the word \\"church\\" did not mean a building or housing structure (for which Greek-speakers might have used the word \\"basilica\\") but meant a community or gathering of like peoples (see ekklesia). The earliest Ecclesiology would posit that the Eucharistic assembly, under the authority and permission of a Bishop, is what constitutes a Church. As St. Ignatius of Antioch said, \\"Let no man do anything connected with the Church without the bishop. Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist, which is [administered] either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church. It is not lawful without the bishop either to baptize or to celebrate a love- feast.\\"Ignatius of Antioch, Epistle to the Smyrnaeans VIII The original church or community of the East before the Great Schism comprised: * the Greek churches founded by Saint Paul * the Antiochian and Asia Minor churches founded by Saint Peter * the Coptic (or Egyptian) churches founded by Saint Mark (including, at the time, the Ethiopians of Abyssinia) * the Syriac (or Assyrian) churches in Upper Mesopotamia * the Georgian church, traditionally founded by Saint Andrew and Saint Nino * the Armenian church, traditionally founded by Saint Jude and Saint Bartholomew * the church of Jerusalem, founded by Saint James, as well as the churches of Samaria and Judea, together comprising \\"the Holy Land\\". The church of Rome by tradition was founded by both Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Systematic persecution of the early Christian church caused it to become an underground movement. The first above-ground legal churches were built in Armenia (see Echmiadzin). Armenia became the first country to legalize Christianity (around 301 AD) under King Tiridates III and also embrace it as the state religion in 310 AD. However, illegal churches before \\"Christian legalization\\" are mentioned throughout church history; for example, in the City of Nisibis during the persecutions of Diocletian. Of the underground churches that existed before legalization, some are recorded to have existed in the catacombs of Europe i.e. Catacombs of Rome and also in Greece (see Cave of the Apocalypse, The Church of St George and the church at Pergamon) and also in the underground cities of Anatolia such as Derinkuyu Underground City (also see Cave monastery and Bab Kisan). Also noteworthy are the Church of St Peter in Antioch and the Cenacle in Jerusalem. =Patristic Age= Much of the official organizing of the ecclesiastical structure, clarifying true from false teachings was done by the bishops of the church. Their works are referred to as Patristics. This tradition of clarification can be seen as established in the saints of the Orthodox Church referred to as the Apostolic Fathers, bishops themselves established by apostolic succession. This also continued into the age when the practice of the religion of Christianity became legal (see the Ecumenical Councils). The Biblical canon began with the officially accepted books of the Koine Greek Old Testament (which predates Christianity). This canon, called the Septuagint or seventy, continues to be the Old Testament of the Orthodox faith, along with the New Testament's Good news (gospels), Revelations and Letters of the Apostles (including Acts of the Apostles and the Epistle to the Hebrews). The earliest text of the New Testament was written in common or Koine Greek. The texts of the Old Testament had previously been translated into a single language, Koine Greek, in the time of Ptolemy II Philadelphus in 200 BC. \\"The Letter Of Aristeas\\", R.H. Charles-Editor, Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1913 The early Christians had no way to have a copy of the works that later became the canon and other church works accepted but not canonized. Much of the original church liturgical services functioned as a means of learning these works. Orthodox Church services today continue to serve this educational function. The issue of collecting the various works of the eastern churches and compiling them into a canon, each being confirmed as authentic text was a long protracted process. Much of this process was motivated by a need to address various heresies. In many instances, heretical groups had themselves begun compiling and disseminating text that they used to validate their positions, positions that were not consistent with the text, history and traditions of the Orthodox faith. =Divine Liturgy= Liturgical services, especially the Eucharist service, are based on repeating the actions of Jesus (\\"do this in remembrance of me\\"), using the bread and wine, and saying his words (known as the words of the institution). The church has the rest of the liturgical ritual being rooted in Jewish Passover, Siddur, Seder, and synagogue services, including the singing of hymns (especially the Psalms) and reading from the Scriptures (Old and New Testament). The final uniformity of liturgical services became solidified after the church established a Biblical canon, being based on the Apostolic Constitutions and Clementine literature. =Bible= In the Orthodox view, Bible represents those texts approved by the church for the purpose of conveying the most important parts of what it already believed. The oldest list of books for the canon is the Muratorian fragment dating to c. 170 (see also Chester Beatty Papyri). The oldest complete canon of the Christian Bible was found at Saint Catherine's Monastery (see Codex Sinaiticus) and later sold to the British by the Soviets in 1933.BBC NEWS Technology Oldest known Bible to go online Parts of the codex are still considered stolen by the Monastery even today. These texts (as a whole) were not universally considered canonical until the church reviewed, edited, accepted and ratified them in 368 AD (also see the Council of Laodicea). Salvation or Soteriology from the Orthodox perspective is achieved not by knowledge of scripture but by being a member of the church or community and cultivating phronema and theosis through participation in the church or community.Saint Cyprian wrote, \\"A man cannot have God as his Father if he does not have the Church as his Mother.\\" Stated the other way around, Georges Florovsky said: \\"Outside the Church there is no salvation, because salvation is the Church.\\"NPNF2-01. Eusebius Pamphilius: Church History, Life of Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine Christian Classics Ethereal Library Pentarchy By the 5th century, Christian ecclesiology had organized a hierarchical \\"pentarchy\\", or system of five sees (patriarchates), with a settled order of precedence. The first four of the patriarchs were located in the largest cities of the Roman Empire, while the fifth was in Jerusalem, a city deriving its importance from being the place where the Christian Church was founded, despite its relatively small size. All five locations also had Christian communities who traced their lineage back to one or several Apostles. Thus, in order of precedence, the five patriarchates (and the Apostles claimed as founders by each patriarchate) were as follows: * Rome (founded by Sts. Peter and Paul), currently in Italy. This was the only Pentarch in the Western Roman Empire, and is now better known as the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church. * Constantinople (St. Andrew), currently in Turkey * Alexandria (St. Mark), currently in Egypt * Antioch (St. Peter), currently in Syria * Jerusalem (St. James), currently in Israel Two patriarchates are noted to have been founded by St Peter, the patriarchate of Rome and the patriarchate of Antioch. The Eastern churches accept Antioch as the church founded by St Peter (see the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch and the Syriac Orthodox Church). Byzantine period Hagia Sophia at night It was in the establishment of the Eastern Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great that Christianity was legalized (Edict of Milan, 313). It was not until then, that systematic Roman persecution of Christians stopped, although it did resurface later, though temporarily, under Roman Paganism (Emperor Julian the Apostate). Christianity as Orthodox was not established as the State Religion in the Eastern part of the Roman Empire until Theodosius I convened The First Council of Constantinople or the (second ecumenical council) in 381. This council put an end to the Arianism controversy by establishing the Trinitarian doctrine. Legalization included the calling of the Ecumenical Councils to resolve disputes and establish church dogma on which the entire church would agree. Thus defining what it means to be a Christian in a universal or broad sense of the word the Greek word for universal being katholik√≥s or catholic. These councils being also the continuation of the church council tradition that predated legalization (see Synod). According to Joseph Raya, \\"Byzantine culture and Orthodoxy are one and the same.\\".Raya, The Byzantine Church and Culture In the 530s the second Church of the Holy Wisdom (Hagia Sophia) was built in Constantinople under emperor Justinian I, to become the center of the ecclesiastical community for the rulers of the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantium. The first church had been destroyed during the Nika riots. =Ecumenical councils= These Pre Ecumenical councils include the Council of Jerusalem c. 50, Council of Rome (155), Second Council of Rome 193 AD, Council of Ephesus 193 AD, Council of Carthage (251), Council of Iconium 258 AD, Council of Antioch (264), Councils of Arabia 246‚Äì247 AD, Council of Elvira 306 AD, Council of Carthage (311), Synod of Neo-Caesarea c.314 AD Council of Ancyra 314 AD, Council of Arles (314). The first ecumenical council in part was a continuation of Trinitarian doctrinal issues addressed in pre- legalization of Christianity councils or synods (for examples see Synods of Antioch between 264‚Äì269AD and Synod of Elvira). As such, they constitute a permanent standard for an Orthodox understanding of the Trinity, the person or hypostasis of Christ, the incarnation.Papadakis, Aristeides. History of the Orthodox Church The tradition of councils within the church started with the apostolic council of Jerusalem, but this council is not numbered as an ecumenical council. It was convened to address the Abrahamic tradition of circumcision and its relation to converted Gentiles (Acts 15). Its decisions are accepted by all Christians,Karl Josef von Hefele's commentary on canon II of Gangra notes: \\"We further see that, at the time of the Synod of Gangra, the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the Greeks, indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show. Balsamon also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty-third Apostolic Canon, expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by St. Augustine in his work Contra Faustum, where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few. But still, as late as the eighth century, Pope Gregory the Third 731 forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days. No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be one of the undisputed Ecumenical Synods, can be of greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuser, like other laws.\\" and later definitions of an ecumenical council to conform to this sole Biblical council. The First seven Ecumenical Councils were held between 325 (the First Council of Nicaea) and 787 (the Second Council of Nicaea), which the Orthodox recognize as the definitive interpretation of Christian dogma. ; First Council of Nicaea (Nicaea, 325) : convoked by the Roman Emperor Constantine, condemning the view of Arius that the Son is a created being inferior to the Father. ; Second Ecumenical Council (Constantinople, 381) : defining the nature of the Holy Spirit against those asserting His inequality with the other persons of the Trinity. Under Theodosius I this council marks the end of the Arian conflict in the Eastern Roman Empire.. ; Third Ecumenical Council (Ephesus 431) : affirmed that Mary is truly \\"Birth giver\\" or \\"Mother\\" of God (Theotokos), contrary to the teachings of Nestorius. ; Fourth Ecumenical Council (Chalcedon, 451) : affirmed that Jesus is truly God and truly man, without mixture of the two natures, contrary to Monophysite teaching. ; Fifth Ecumenical Council (Constantinople, 553) : interpreting the decrees of Chalcedon and further explaining the relationship of the two natures of Jesus; it also condemned the teachings of Origen on the pre-existence of the soul, and Apocatastasis. ; Sixth Ecumenical Council (Constantinople, 681) : declaring that Christ has two wills of his two natures, human and divine, contrary to the teachings of the Monothelites. ; Seventh Ecumenical Council (Nicea, 787) : called under the Empress Regnant Irene, it affirmed the making and veneration of icons, while also forbidding the worship of icons and the making of three-dimensional statuary. It reversed the declaration of an earlier council that had called itself the Seventh Ecumenical Council and also nullified its status (see separate article on Iconoclasm). That earlier council had been held under the iconoclast Emperor Constantine V. It met with more than 340 bishops at Constantinople and Hieria in 754, declaring the making of icons of Jesus or the saints an error, mainly for Christological reasons. The Orthodox Church also recognizes the Fourth Council of Constantinople in 879 as Ecumenical, and continues to participate in dogmatically binding councils. Confronting Arianism Eusebius of Caesarea The First Ecumenical Council was convened to address the divinity of Christ once more (see Paul of Samosata and the Synods of Antioch) but this time through the teachings of Arius, an Egyptian presbyter from Alexandria, who taught that Jesus Christ was created, albeit divine, and not God in essence: both the Father and the Son where of \\"like\\" essence or being (see homoiousia) but not of the same essence or being (see homoousia). Much of the controversion was over the kenotic phrasing that Christ expressed in the New Testament to express submission to God the Father.Orthodox Dogmatic Theology: A Concise Exposition Protopresbyter Michael Pomazansky pages 92‚Äì95. This Ecumenical council declared that Jesus Christ was a distinct from God in existence (hypostasis or persona). Jesus was God in essence, being and nature (ousia or substantia). The first council did not end the conflict. When Emperor Constantine I was baptized, the baptism was performed by an Arian bishop and relative, Eusebius of Nicomedia. Also the charges of Christian corruption by Constantine (see the Constantinian shift) ignore the fact that Constantine deposed Athanasius of Alexandria and later restored Arius, who had been branded a heresiarch by the Nicene Council. After his death, Constantine I was succeeded by two Arian Emperors Constantius II (son of Constantine I) and Valens. It was not until the co-reigns of Gratian and Theodosius that Arianism was effectively wiped out among the ruling class and elite of the Eastern Empire. Theodosius' wife St Flacilla was instrumental in his campaign to end Arianism. This later culminated into the killing of some 300,000 Orthodox Christians at the hands of Arians in Milan in 538AD.Atrocity statistics from the Roman Era Iconoclasm Andrei Rublev's Trinity The Iconoclasm (730‚Äì787 and 813‚Äì843) was a movement within the Byzantine church to establish that the Christian culture of portraits (see icon) of the family of Christ and subsequent Christians and biblical scenes were not of a Christian origin and therefore heretical.Epitome, Iconoclast Council at Hieria, 754 The group destroyed much of the Christian churches' art history, until it was later defined as heretical itself under the Seventh Ecumenical council. The iconoclasts considered the tradition of icons as contrary to the ban on 'graven images', interpretated in a narrow sense as 'engraved or carved'. This forbade many of the ornaments that Moses was commanded to create in the passages right after the commandment was given, i.e., cherubim., as well as the Cross and other holy artifacts. The Orthodox Church understands this in a wider sense as a ban on no carved images: the people of God are not to create idols and then worship them. =Tensions with the Papacy= Furthermore, the loss of the Patriarchate of Alexandria following the schism regarding the Council of Chalcedon (451), which led to the separation between the Byzantine Church and the Alexandrian Coptic Church, as well as the fall of the Patriarchates of Antioch and Jerusalem following the conquest of Palestine and Syria during the rise of Islam, made the theory of the Pentarchy more of a simple theory, than a practical reality. These events also led to the Patriarch of Constantinople centralizing more power in his office, acting alone as the sole Patriarch remaining in the East until the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453. Two basic problems‚Äîthe primacy of the bishop of Rome and the procession of the Holy Spirit‚Äîwere involved. These doctrinal differences were first openly discussed during the patriarchate of Photius I. Rome began to interpret her primacy among the Pentarchy of five sees in terms of sovereignty, as a God-given right involving universal jurisdiction in the Church. The churches of the East gave the Roman See primacy but not supremacy, i.e. the Pope being the first among equals, but not as an absolute authority with the ability to make infallible statements.The Orthodox Church London by Ware, Kallistos St. Vladimir's Seminary Press 1995 The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church by Vladimir Lossky, SVS Press, 1997. () James Clarke & Co Ltd, 1991. ()History of Russian Philosophy by Nikolai Lossky History of Russian Philosophy by Nikolai Lossky p. 87 Photian schism Photius refused to accept the supremacy of the pope in Orthodox matters, or accept the Filioque clause that had been added to the Nicene Creed by the Latin church, and was later the theological breaking point in the ultimate Great Schism in the 11th century. The controversy also involved ecclesiastical jurisdictional rights in the Bulgarian church. Photios did provide concession on the issue of jurisdictional rights concerning Bulgaria, and the papal legates made do with his return of Bulgaria to Rome. This concession, however, was purely nominal, as Bulgaria's return to the Byzantine rite in 870 had already secured for it an autocephalous church. Without the consent of Boris I of Bulgaria, the papacy was unable to enforce any of its claims. Mission to Great Moravia Prince Rastislav In Great Moravia, the two brothers encountered Frankish missionaries from Germany, who represented the Latin branch of the Church, more particularly representing the Holy Roman Empire as founded by Charlemagne, and committing to linguistic and cultural uniformity. They insisted on the use of the Latin liturgy, and regarded Moravia as their rightful mission field. Conversion of Eastern and Southern Slavs Orthodox churches in Vologda, Russia In the 9th and 10th centuries, Christianity made great inroads into Eastern Europe: first in Bulgaria and Serbia, then followed by Kievan Rus'. For a period of time, there was a real possibility that all of the newly baptized South Slav nations, Bulgarians, Serbs, and Croats would join the Western church, but in the end, only the Croats joined. The Serbs were baptised during the reign of Heraclius (610‚Äì641) by \\"elders of Rome\\" according to Constantine Porphyrogenitus in his annals (r. 913‚Äì959). The forming of Christianity as state religion dates to the time of the Eastern Orthodox missionaries (Saints) Cyril and Methodius during Basil I (r. 867‚Äì886), who baptised the Serbs sometime before helping Knez Mutimir in the war against the Saracens in 869, after acknowledging the suzerainty of the Byzantine Empire. A Serbian bishopric (Diocese of Ras) may have been founded in Stari Ras in 871 by Serbian Knez Mutimir, confirmed by the Council of Constantinople in 879‚Äì80.Serbian Orthodox Diocese of Raska and Prizren The Serbs and Bulgarians adopt the Old Slavonic liturgy instead of the Greek.De Administrando ImperioThe wars of the Balkan Peninsula: their medieval origins In 863, a mission from the Patriarch of Constantinople converted King Boris I of Bulgaria to Christianity. Boris realized that the Christianization of his subjects by the Byzantine mission would facilitate the undesired spread of Byzantine influence in Bulgaria, as the liturgy was carried out in the Greek language, and the newly established Bulgarian Church was subordinate to the Church of Constantinople. A popular revolt against the new religion prompted the King to request that the Bulgarian Church be granted independence, which was refused by Constantinople. Boris turned to the Pope, and the arrival of the Roman clerical mission concluded the activity of the Byzantine mission, which was ordered by the King to leave Bulgaria. Constantinople nervously watched the events taking place in their northern neighbour, because a pro- Rome Bulgaria threatened its immediate interests. A religious council was held in the summer of 867 in the Byzantine capital, during which the Roman Church's behaviour was harshly condemned. As a personal culprit, Pope Nicholas I was anathematized. In a letter to Boris, the Byzantine emperor Michael III expressed his disapproval of Bulgaria's religious reorientation and used offensive language against the Roman Church. The old rivalry between the two Churches burned with new power. The Roman mission's efforts were met with success and King Boris asked Pope Nicholas I to appoint Formosa of Portua as Bulgarian Archbishop. The Pope refused, and his successor Pope Adrian II turned out to be even more disinclined to comply, so Boris turned again to Constantinople. This resulted in the creation of an autonomous national (Bulgarian) Archbishopric. In the next 10 years, Pope Adrian II and his successors made desperate attempts to reclaim their influence in Bulgaria, but their efforts ultimately failed. The foundations of the Bulgarian national Church had been set. The next stage was the implementation of the Glagolitic alphabet and the Slavonic language as official language of the Bulgarian Church and State in 893 AD. St. Clement, St. Naum and St. Angelaruis returned to Bulgaria, where they managed to instruct several thousand future Slavonic clergymen in the rites using the Slavic language and the Glagolitic alphabet. In 893 AD, Bulgaria expelled its Byzantine clergy and proclaimed the Slavonic language as the official language of the Bulgarian Church and State. Great Schism In the 11th century the East‚ÄìWest Schism took place between Rome and Constantinople, resulting in a separation between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church (with both claiming to represent the sole legitimate continuation of the original Church). There were doctrinal issues like the filioque clause and the authority of the Pope involved in the split, but these were exacerbated by cultural and linguistic differences between Latins and Greeks. Prior to that, the Eastern and Western halves of the Church had frequently been in conflict, particularly during the periods of iconoclasm and the Photian schism. The Orthodox Byzantine Greeks perceived the Papacy as taking on monarch type characteristics that were not inline with the Church's historical tradition as can be seen in the words of Archbishop Niketas of Nicomedia of the 12th century: =Hesychast controversy= Gregory Palamas Under church tradition the practice of Hesychasm has it beginnings in the bible, Matthew 6:6 and the Philokalia. It is a form of constant purposeful prayer or experiential prayer, explicitly referred to as contemplation. The tradition of contemplation with inner silence or tranquility is shared by all Eastern asceticism movements, having its roots in the Egyptian traditions of monasticism exemplified by such Orthodox monastics as St Anthony of Egypt. The Hesychasts stated that at higher stages of their practice they reached the actual contemplation-union with the Tabor Light, i.e., Uncreated Divine Light or photomos seen by the apostles in the event of the Transfiguration of Christ and Saint Paul while on the road to Damascus. It is depicted in icons and theological discourse as tongues of fire.Byzantine Theology: Historical Trends and Doctrinal Themes by John Meyendorff pg 172 Around the year 1337, Hesychasm attracted the attention of a learned member of the Orthodox Church, Barlaam, a Calabrian monk who at that time held the office of abbot in the Monastery of St Saviour's in Constantinople and who visited Mount Athos. There, he encountered Hesychasts and heard descriptions of their practices, also reading the writings of the teacher in Hesychasm of St Gregory Palamas, himself an Athonite monk. Trained in Scholastic theology, Barlaam was scandalized by Hesychasm and began to campaign against it. As a teacher of theology in the Scholastic mode, Barlaam propounded a more intellectual and propositional approach to the knowledge of God than the Hesychasts taught. In particular, he took exception to the Hesychasts doctrine to the nature of the uncreated light, the experience of which was said to be the goal of Hesychast practice. Barlaam held this concept to be polytheistic, inasmuch as it postulated two eternal substances, a visible (immanent) and an invisible God (transcendent). On the Hesychast side, the controversy was taken up by Antonite St Gregory Palamas, afterwards Archbishop of Thessalonica, who was asked by his fellow monks on Mt Athos to defend Hesychasm from Barlaam's attacks. St Gregory was well-educated in Greek philosophy (dialectical method) and thus able to defend Hesychasm. In 1341 the dispute came before a synod held at Constantinople and was presided over by the Emperor Andronicus; the synod, taking into account the regard in which the writings of the pseudo- Dionysius were held, condemned Barlaam, who recanted and returned to Calabria, becoming a bishop in the Roman Catholic Church. Three other synods on the subject were held, at the second of which the followers of Barlaam gained a brief victory. In 1351, at a synod under the presidency of Emperor John VI Cantacuzenus, Hesychast doctrine and Palamas' Essence-Energies distinction was established as the doctrine of the Orthodox Church. One of Barlaam's friends, Gregory Akindynos, who originally was also a friend of Gregory's, later took up the controversy. Another opponent of Palamism was Manuel Kalekas who sought to reconcile the Eastern and Western Churches. Following the decision of 1351, there was strong repression against anti-Palamist thinkers, who ultimately had no choice but to emigrate and convert to Catholicism. This exodus of highly educated Greek scholars, later reinforced by refugees following the Fall of Constantinople of 1453, had a significant influence on the first generation (that of Petrarca and Boccaccio) of the incipient Italian Renaissance. =Eastern monastic or ascetic tradition= Icon Depicting Souls Ascent to Heaven With the elevation of Christianity to the status of a legal religion within the Roman Empire by Constantine the Great, with the edict of Milan (313), many Orthodox felt a new decline in the ethical life of Christians. In reaction to this decline, many refused to accept any compromises and fled the world or societies of mankind, to become monastics. Monasticism thrived, especially in Egypt, with two important monastic centers, one in the desert of Wadi Natroun, by the Western Bank of the Nile, with Abba Ammoun (d. 356) as its founder, and one called Scetis in the desert of Skete, south of Nitria, with Saint Makarios of Egypt (died c. Egypt 330) as its founder. These monks were anchorites, following the monastic ideal of St. Anthony the Great, Paul of Thebes and Saint Pachomius. They lived by themselves, gathering together for common worship on Saturdays and Sundays only. This is not to say that Monasticism or Orthodox Asceticism was created whole cloth at the time of legalization but rather at the time it blossomed into a mass movement. Charismatics as the ascetic movement was considered had no clerical status as such. Later history developed around the Greek (Mount Athos) and Syrian (Cappadocia) forms of monastic life, along with the formation of Monastic Orders or monastic organization. The three main forms of Ascetics' traditions being Skete, Cenobite and Hermit respectively. =Crusades= Conquest of the Orthodox city of Constantinople by the crusaders in 1204 Prince Alexander Nevsky defeats the Teutonic Knights at the Battle of the Ice in 1242 (20th century work) The final breach between Greeks and Latins is often considered to have arisen after the capture and sacking of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Crusades against Orthodox Christians by Roman Catholic crusaders were not exclusive to this crusade nor the Mediterranean. The sacking of Constantinople and the Church of Holy Wisdom, the destruction of the Monastery of Stoudios, Library of Constantinople and the establishment of the Latin Empire in Constantinople and also throughout West Asia Minor and Greece (see the Kingdom of Thessalonica, Kingdom of Cyprus) are considered definitive though. This is in light of Roman Catholic atrocities not exclusive to the capital city of Constantinople in 1204 starting the period in Greece referred to as Frangokratia. The establishment of the Latin Empire in 1204 was intended to supplant the Orthodox Byzantine Empire. This is symbolized by many Orthodox churches being converted into Roman Catholic properties and churches like Hagia Sophia and Church of the Pantokrator, and it is viewed with some rancor to the present day. Some of the European Christian community actively endorsed the attacking of Orthodox Christians.\\"The Sack of Constantinople by the Crusaders\\" The Teutonic Order's failed attempts to conquer Orthodox Russia (particularly the Republics of Pskov and Novgorod), an enterprise endorsed by Pope Gregory IX,Christiansen, Erik (1997). The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books, 287. . can also be considered as a part of the Northern Crusades. One of the major blows for the idea of the conquest of Russia was the Battle of the Ice in 1242. With or without the Pope's blessing, Sweden also undertook several crusades against Orthodox Novgorod. Many Orthodox saw the actions of the Catholics in the Mediterranean as a prime determining factor in the weakening of Byzantium which led to the Empire's eventual conquest and fall to Islam.\\"Fourth Crusade, 1202‚Äì1204\\" Even after Greek control of Byzantium was re-established, the empire never recovered the strength it had had even in 1200, and the sole effect of the fourth crusade was to weaken Europe's chief protection against the Turks. Some Orthodox see a continuation of Roman Catholic hostility in the establishment of the Uniate or Eastern Catholic Churches (see the sainting of Bissarion in 1950).Unia In 2004, Pope John Paul II extended a formal apology for the sacking of Constantinople in 1204; the apology was formally accepted by Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople. Many things that were stolen during this time: holy relics, riches, and many other items, are still held in various Western European cities, particularly Venice. =Establishment of the Roman Catholic Latin Empire= After the Sack of Constantinople in 1204 AD by Roman Catholic Crusaders as part of the fourth crusade, much of Asia Minor was brought under Roman Catholic rule and the Latin Empire of the East was established. As the conquest by the European crusaders was not exclusive to the fourth crusade, many various kingdoms of European rule were established. After the fall of Constantinople to the Latin West, the Empire of Nicaea was established, which was later to be the origin of the Greek monarchy that defeated the Latin forces of Europe and re-established Orthodox Monarchy in Constantinople and Asia Minor. Ottoman period In 1453AD, the city of Constantinople the last stronghold of the Byzantine Empire fell to the Ottoman Empire. By this time, Egypt had been under Muslim control for some seven centuries. Jerusalem had been conquered by the Umayyad Muslims in 638, won back by Rome in 1099 under the First Crusade and then finally reconquered by the Ottoman Muslims in 1517. Under Ottoman rule, the Greek Orthodox Church acquired power as an autonomous millet. The ecumenical patriarch was the religious and administrative ruler of the entire \\"Orthodox nation\\" (Ottoman administrative unit), which encompassed all the Orthodox subjects of the Empire, but was dominated by ethnic Greeks. Under the Ottoman Empire, violence against non-Muslims was common. One of the worst such episodes occurred under Yavuz Sultan Selim I.In Memory Of The 50 Million Victims Of The Orthodox Christian HolocaustHistory of the Copts of Egypt These event include the atrocities against, among others, the Serbs in AD 1804‚Äì1878 the Greeks in AD 1814‚Äì1832,History of THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE and the Bulgarian AD 1876‚Äì1877History of BULGARIA (also see Phanariote).

Christian Greek orthodox Neomartyrs: A Case Study Stavronikita monastery, South-East view =Religious rights= The Orthodox Church was an accepted institution under the Ottomans, in contrast to Catholicism which was associated with enemy Austria, and actually grew in size during Ottoman rule. This included the building of churches and monasteries. =Fall of the Ottoman Empire= The fall of the Ottoman was precipitated by the Roman Catholic and Orthodox disputed possession of the Church of the Nativity and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. During the early 1850s, the two sides made demands which the Sultan could not possibly satisfy simultaneously. In 1853, the Sultan adjudicated in favour of the French, despite the vehement protestations of the local Orthodox monks. The ruling Ottoman siding with Rome over the Orthodox provoked outright war (see the Eastern Question). As the Ottoman Empire had been for sometime falling into political, social and economic decay (see the Sick Man of Europe) this conflict ignited the Crimean War in 1850 between Russia and the Ottoman Empire. =Persecution by the \\"Young Turks\\"= Systematic massacres took place in 1894‚Äì1896 when Sultan Abdul killed 300,000 Armenians throughout the provinces. In 1909 government troops killed, in the towns of Adana alone, over 20,000 Christian Armenians. Also, in the first two decades of the 20th century, there were massacres of Greeks, Slavs, and Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, culminating in the Armenian, Greek and Assyrian genocides. As a result, the 20th century saw a sharp decline of the number of Orthodox Christians, and of Christians in general, in the Anatolian peninsula amidst complaints of Turkish governmental repression of various Eastern and Oriental Orthodox groups.Massacres, Resistance, Protectors: Muslim-Christian Relations in Eastern Anatolia during World War I, by David Gaunt, 2006The Forgotten Genocide: Eastern Christians, the Last Arameans, p.195, by S√©bastien de Courtois =Republic of Turkey= During the Lausanne Conference in 1923, the Turkish and Greek sides after some discussions accepted the proposal of a population exchange. Muslims in Greece (save the ones in Eastern Thrace) were expelled to Turkey, and Greek Orthodox people in Turkey (save the ones in Istanbul) were expelled to Greece. In September 1955, a pogrom was directed primarily at Istanbul's 100,000-strong Greek minority.Speros Vryonis, The Mechanism of Catastrophe: The Turkish Pogrom of September 6‚Äì7, 1955, and the Destruction of the Greek Community of Istanbul, New York: Greekworks.com 2005, The pogrom greatly accelerated emigration of ethnic Greeks from the Istanbul region (the former Constantinople), reducing the 200,000-strong Greek minority in 1924 to just over 5,000 in 2005.

Russia Kizhi Transfiguration church The success of the conversion of the Bulgarians facilitated the conversion of other East Slavic peoples, most notably the Rus', predecessors of Belarusians, Russians, and Ukrainians. By the beginning of the 11th century most of the Slavic world, including, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Russia had converted to Orthodox Christianity. Bulgaria's Church was officially recognized as a Patriarchate by Constantinople in 927, Serbia's in 1346, and Russia's in 1589. Through a series of Wars with the World of Islam the church did indeed establish itself as the protector of Orthodoxy (see the Eastern Question and the Russo-Turkish wars). =Under Mongol rule= Russia lay under Mongol rule from the 13th through the 15th century. The Mongol invasion of Rus of 1237‚Äì1242AD led to what is called the Tatar period in Russian history. This period led to great calamity for the internal structure of Russia. Much of Russia was ruled by Mongols and Russian Princes (of whom had limited power). The eventual end of the reign of the Golden Horde is said to have begun with the Battle of Kulikovo 8 September 1380. Which involves the famous Orthodox legend of Monk and Russian champion Alexander Peresvet and his death that mark the battle's beginning. The final pseudo-battle or face off that ended Mongol rule in Russia was the Great stand on the Ugra river in 1480AD. The death toll (by battle, massacre, flooding, and famine) of the Mongol wars of conquest is placed at about 40 million according to some sources.Twentieth Century Atlas ‚Äì Historical Body Count =Synodal period= Churches of the Moscow Kremlin, as seen from the Balchug The Russian Orthodox Church held a privileged position in the Russian Empire, expressed in the motto, Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality, of the late Russian Empire. It obtained immunity from taxation in 1270, and was allowed to impose taxes on the peasants. At the same time, it was placed under the control of the Tsar by the Church reform of Peter I in the 1721, who replaced the Russian patriarchate by the Most Holy Synod, which was run by an official, titled Ober-Procurator, appointed by the Tsar himself. The church was involved in various campaigns of russification,Natalia Shlikhta (2004) \\"'Greek Catholic'-'Orthodox'-'Soviet': a symbiosis or a conflict of identities?\\" in Religion, State & Society, Volume 32, Number 3 (Routledge) and, as a consequence, it was accused of participating in anti-Jewish pogroms.It is no coincidence that in the entry on 'Orthodoxy' in the seventh volume of the Kratkaya Evreiskaya Entsyklopedia, devoted to the Russian Orthodox Church (pp. 733‚Äì743), where numerous examples are given of persecution of the Jews in Russia, including religious persecution, no evidence is given of the direct participation of the church, either in legislative terms or in the conduct of policy.

But once again we must emphasise that unlike the Western churches, 'antisemitic policies were not conducted in the name of the Russian Orthodox Church'. http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?id=787 In modern times, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn has been accused of antisemitism for his book Two Hundred Years Together, where he alleges Jewish participation in the political repression of the Soviet regime (see also Hebrew and Byzantine relations).Solzhenitsyn breaks last taboo of the revolution Russia Guardian UnlimitedRussian Jews charge Solzhenitsyn with altering history Solzhenitsyn's book Two Hundred Years Together is a historical study of the relationship between Russian Orthodox Christians and Jews in Russia from 1772 to modern times.Solzhenitsyn New Book, Soviet Repression, Jews ‚Äì Johnson's Russia List 1-25-03Lydia Chukovskaya ‚Äì Interview with Solzhentisyn about \\"200 Years Together\\" The Church, like the Tsarist state was seen as an enemy of the people by the Bolsheviks and other Russian revolutionaries. =Soviet Union= The Russian Orthodox Church collaborated with the White Army in the Russian Civil War (see White movement) after the October Revolution.

This included the Eastern European bloc countries as well as the Balkan States. Since some of these Slavic states tied their ethnic heritage to their ethnic churches, both the peoples and their church were targeted by the Soviet and its form of State atheism.President of Lithuania: Prisoner of the Gulag a Biography of Aleksandras Stulginskis by Afonsas Eidintas Genocide and Research Center of Lithuania / 9789986757412 / 9986-757-41-X pg 23 \\"As early as August 1920 Lenin wrote to E.

Christ the Savior Cathedral Moscow after reconstruction In the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to less than 500. Between 1917 and 1940, 130,000 Orthodox priests were arrested. The widespread persecution and internecine disputes within the church hierarchy led to the seat of the Patriarch of Moscow being vacant from 1925 to 1943. Some 20,000 people were executed just outside Butovo, a good percentage of which were Orthodox clergy, ascetics, and laymen.New York Times article on Shrine to Stalins killing fields In the Soviet Union, in addition to the methodical closing and destruction of churches, the charitable and social work formerly done by ecclesiastical authorities was taken over by the state.

In some other communist states such as Romania, the Orthodox Church as an organisation enjoyed relative freedom and even prospered, albeit under strict secret police control. That, however, did not rule out demolishing churches and monasteries as part of broader systematization (urban planning), state persecution of individual believers, and Romania stands out as a country which ran a specialised institution where many Orthodox (along with peoples of other faiths) were subjected to psychological punishment or torture and mind control experimentation in order to force them give up their religious convictions (see Pite»ôti Prison). However, this was only supported by one faction within the regime. The Communist authorities closed down the prison in 1952, and punished many of those responsible for abuses (twenty of them were sentenced to death).Dumitru Bacu, The Anti-Humans.

An Incursion into the History of Romanian Communism\\"), Editura Curtea Veche, Bucharest, 2005 China Eastern Catholic or \\"Byzantine Rite\\" churches Domes of a Ukrainian Catholic parish in Simpson, Pennsylvania The Eastern Catholic Churches make up 2% of the membership of the Roman Catholic Church and less than 10% of all Eastern Christians. Most Eastern Catholic churches have counterparts in other Eastern churches, whether Assyrian or Oriental Orthodox, from whom they are separated by a number of theological differences, or the Eastern Orthodox churches, from whom they are separated primarily by differences in understanding of the role of the Bishop of Rome within the College of Bishops. The Eastern Catholic churches were located historically in Eastern Europe, the Asian Middle East, Northern Africa and India, but are now, because of migration, found also in Western Europe, the Americas and Oceania. =Origins= The Maronite Church and the Syro-Malabar Church are Eastern Catholic churches that never broke communion with the Church of Rome. Within the Antiochian church the Eastern Catholic movement started after the Ottoman Turks' conquest of Antioch in the early 15th century, under whose control it remained until the breakup of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I. During this period, in 1724, the Church of Antioch was again weakened by schism, as a major portion of its faithful came into communion with the See of Rome. The resultant body is known as the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, which maintains close ties with the Orthodox and is holding ongoing talks about healing the schism. The movement to reestablish communion with the See of Rome within East-Central Europe was started with the 1598‚Äì1599 Union of Brest, by which the \\"Metropolia of Kiev-Halych and all Rus'\\" entered into relationship with the Roman Catholic Church. A century later, a similar movement occurred in Romania, as described on the website of Delia Despina Dumitrica. =Conflict between Eastern Catholics and Eastern Orthodox= Since the beginnings of the Uniate movement, there have been periodic conflicts between the Orthodox and Uniate in Poland and Western Russia.Pg. 97 During the Time of Troubles there was a plan (by the conquering Polish monarchy) to convert all of Russia to Roman Catholicism. Patriarch Hermogenes was martyred by the Roman Catholics during this period (see also Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìMuscovite Commonwealth). The Eastern Catholic churches consider themselves to have reconciled the East and West Schism by keeping their prayers and rituals similar to those of Eastern Orthodoxy, while also accepting the primacy of the Bishop of Rome. Some Orthodox charge that joining in this unity comes at the expense of ignoring critical doctrinal differences and past atrocities. From the perspective of many Eastern Orthodox, Eastern Catholicism is a ploy by Roman Catholicism to undermine and ultimately destroy their church by undermining its legitimacy and absorbing it into the Roman Catholic Church. It is feared that this ploy would diminish the power to the original eastern Patriarchs of the church and would require the acceptance of rejected doctrines and Scholasticism over faith. We are Orthodox from Czechoslovakia. God permitted for us to be greatly tested. We feel, He is burning and testing us like gold in a crucible. We also feel, we are not like gold to survive this fire without the help of God and support of our brothers throughout the world. We beg you therefore to pray for us to the Lord and the Most Holy Theotokos, that Orthodoxy in Czechoslovakia recover her freedom and equal rights with all the other Christian communities and overcome her enemies. The Orthodox Faith was taught to us by the holy brothers Cyril and Methodius in 863. After the repose of Saint Methodius, in 885, the latins expelled the Orthodox priests from Great Moravia and destroyed all their works. Orthodoxy survived only in Carpathia, in the east of our country. The Pope of Rome, unhappy of the fact that the Church (Orthodox) continued to exist, instituted the Unia of Uzgorontzcy in 1649, in which of the 1,200 priests, they allowed only 63. For 300 years the Uniates worked tirelessly to uproot Orthodoxy. Following World War II, people began to return en-masse to the Orthodox Church, which became free again and powerful. But the years of happiness and peace did not last. In 1968 God allowed the first test. The Country recognized the Unia (which called itself \\"Greek Catholic Church\\"), which with the forbearance of the State started to torment the Orthodox followers. They confiscated by force our churches and threw the priests with their families to the street. And nobody came to our support. For a while we thought that everything was finished.... However, our Lord and the Most Holy Theotokos had mercy on us and we did not perish completely. The Uniates \\"allowed\\" us to continue our worship in our churches, which however we had to share with them. Since then we continuously drink daily from the bitter cup of hatred and malice. The devil however cannot rest, seeing that Orthodoxy still survived in Czechoslovakia. He then unleashed the Uniates against us. They now demanded that we hand over all our churches to them with all their wealth and heritage. If this happens then we will have to worship on the street. What would then happen? The happenings of 885, 1649 and 1968? From past history we have bitter experience of the hardships that Rome visited upon us through its Unia. Brothers we seek your help. Terminate all discussions with the Roman Catholics as long as the Unia problem remains unresolved. Come to us and give us courage. You and we are one body, the body of Christ. Let the world know about our suffering brought on by the Uniates. They say they are Christians but are not. Christians have love for their fellow man. Let the papists sent their church letters to the idolaters, not to the Orthodox of Czechoslovakia and the Ukraine. Here live Christians and not idolaters.

Modern history All Saints Belmore, New South Wales, Australia The various autocephalous and autonomous churches of the Orthodox Church are distinct in terms of administration and local culture, but for the most part exist in full communion with one another, with exceptions such as lack of relations between the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) and the Moscow Patriarchate (the Orthodox Church of Russia) dating from the 1920s and due to the subjection of the latter to the hostile Soviet regime.

The community and seat of the patriarchate according to Orthodox tradition was founded by St Peter and then given to St Ignatius, in what is now Turkey. However, in the 15th century, it was moved to Damascus in response to the Ottoman invasion of Antioch. Its traditional territory includes Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and parts of Turkey, while there is a large autonomous diaspora diocese in North America.

Since the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the Church of Cyprus has been engaged in a struggle between rejoining the mainland Church of Greece, being reunited with the Turkish state and independence. **Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria claims succession from the Apostle Mark the Evangelist who founded the Church in the 1st century, and therefore the beginning of Christianity in Africa. It is one of the five ancient patriarchates of the early Church, called the Pentarchy. Sometimes called the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria to distinguish it from the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria. In Egypt, members of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate were also called Melkite, because the favorable orientation of the Byzantine Emperor towards the Council of Chalcedon. The term Melkite is currently used to describe the Melkite Greek Catholic Church members. Since the schism occurring as a result of the political and Christological controversies at the Council of Chalcedon (451), the Greek Orthodox have liturgically been Greek-speaking. After the Arab conquest of North Africa in the 7th century the Orthodox were a minority even among Christians, and remained small for centuries. Today, the Patriarchate of Alexandria in Egypt comprises some 300,000 Orthodox Christians, the highest number since the Roman Empire. *Georgian Orthodox Church. The first Eparchy was founded in Georgia, traditionally by the Apostle Andrew. In 327, Christianity was adopted as the state religion by the rulers of Iberia (Eastern Georgia). From the 320s, the Georgian Orthodox Church was under the jurisdiction of the Apostolic See of Antioch. The Georgian Orthodox Church become autocephalous (independent) in 466 when the Patriarchate of Antioch elevated the Bishop of Mtskheta to the rank of \\"Catholicos of Kartli\\". On March 3, 1990, the Patriarch of Constantinople re-approved the autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church (which had in practice been exercised or at least claimed since the 5th century) as well as the Patriarchal honour of the Catholicos. Today the Georgian Orthodox Church has around 5 million members around the world (of whom about 3,670,000 live within Georgia) and administers, , 35 eparchies (dioceses). *The Bulgarian Orthodox Church lost its autocephalous status after the fall of Bulgaria to the Ottoman Empire. Bulgarian autocephaly was restored in 1953. Saint Sava Cathedral with the monument of Saint Sava *Serbian Orthodox Church gained autocephaly in 1219, patriarchate status in 1345, while it was abolished in long periods during the Ottoman period. The Patriarchate was reunited in 1919‚Äì22. *Romanian Orthodox Church. Today the largest self-governing Church after Russia, it was declared autocephalous in 1885 and became a patriarchate in 1925. =Oriental Orthodoxy= The Coptic Cross *Oriental Orthodox Churches. The Orthodox Church is often referred to as Eastern Orthodox Church in order to distinguish it from the Oriental Orthodoxy (despite the fact that eastern and oriental are synonyms). The (Eastern) Orthodox Church strives to keep the faith of the seven Ecumenical Councils. In contrast, the term \\"Oriental Orthodoxy\\" refers to the churches of Eastern Christian traditions that keep the faith of only the first three ecumenical councils. Both the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches formally believe themselves to be the continuation of the true church and the other to have fallen into schism, although in the past 20 years much work has been done toward ecumenism or reconciliation between the Oriental and Eastern Orthodox churches. There has been an attempt to achieve ecumenism (Russian: sobornost) between the Antiochian and Oriental Orthodox churches. At Chambesy in Switzerland, plenary talks were held resulting in agreements in 1989, 1990 and 1993. All official representatives of the Eastern Orthodox and the Oriental Orthodox reached agreement in these dialogues that the Christological differences between the two communions are more a matter of emphasis than of substance. Although elements in a number of the Eastern Orthodox Churches have criticized the apparent consensus reached by the representatives at Chambesy, the patriarch and holy synod of the Antiochian Orthodox Church welcomed the agreements as positive moves towards a sharing in the Love of God, and a rejection of the hatred of insubstantial division. As recommended in the Second Chambesy Agreement of 1990, the Antiochian (Eastern) Orthodox Patriarch Ignatius IV formally met with the Syriac (Oriental) Orthodox Patriarch, Ignatius Zakka I, on 22 July 1991. At that meeting, the two patriarchs signed a pastoral agreement which called for \\"complete and mutual respect between the two churches. \\" It also prohibited the passing of faithful from one church to the other, envisaged joint meetings of the two holy synods when appropriate, and provided for future guidelines for inter- communion of the faithful and Eucharistic concelebration by the clergy of the two churches. The Church of Antioch expects these guidelines to be issued when the faithful of both churches are ready, but not before. Patriarch Ignatius has also overseen participation in a bilateral commission with the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, which is exploring ways of healing the 18th century schism between the Melkite Catholics and the Antiochian Orthodox. In an unprecedented event, Melkite Patriarch Maximos V addressed a meeting of the Orthodox holy synod in October 1996. The members of the holy synod of Antioch continue to explore greater communication and more friendly meetings with their Syriac, Melkite, and Maronite brothers and sisters, who all share a common heritage.Agreed Official Statements on Christology with the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches ‚Äì OrthodoxWiki Minority communities Distribution of Eastern Orthodoxy in the world by country =European minorities= The Orthodox Churches in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, and Poland have seen drastic changes since the fall of Communism. The Czech Church has recognized contemporary New Martyrs, such as Gorazd (Pavlik) of Prague. The Albanian Orthodox Church split from the Greek Orthodox Church and declared its independence (autocephaly) in 1922. The recognition of the primate by Constantinople came in 1937. =Churches in Asia= Judging from the New Testament account of the rise and expansion of the early church, during the first few centuries of Christianity, the most extensive dissemination of the gospel was not in the West but in the East. In fact, conditions in the Parthian empire (250 BC ‚Äì AD 226), which stretched from the Euphrates to the Indus rivers and the Caspian to the Arabian seas, were in some ways more favourable for the growth of the church than in the Roman world. And though opposition to Christianity increasingly mounted under successive Persian and Islamic rulers, Christian communities were eventually established in the vast territory which stretches from the Near to the Far East possibly as early as the first century of the church. * Chinese Orthodox Church * Japanese Orthodox Church * Korean Orthodox Church * Philippine Orthodox Church See also * Christian Church * Church Fathers * Eastern Orthodox Christian theology * History of Arab Christians * History of Christianity * History of Eastern Christianity * Pentarchy * Seven Ecumenical Councils * Eastern Orthodoxy in Greece * Western Rite Orthodoxy * Eastern Orthodoxy in North America * Timeline of Eastern Orthodoxy in North America Other Eastern apostolic churches: * Oriental Orthodoxy * History of Oriental Orthodoxy * Church of the East * Eastern Rite Roman Catholicism Historical writers: * Metropolitan Hilarion (Alfeyev) * James H.

He collaborated with a fellow composer, George Kleinsinger. Tripp was the creator of the 1945 \\"Tubby the Tuba\\", a piece of classical music for children that has become his best-known work. He authored several books, including Rabbi Santa Claus and Diary of a Leaf.  Early years  Tripp was born in New York City. Tripp attended Brooklyn College and City College of the City University of New York, and he held a master's degree in education. During World War II, he served in the Army Signal Corps.  Career  Early in his career, he was the host of Mr. I. Magination, which was aired by CBS from 1949 to 1952 featuring him as a train engineer who took children through a tunnel to meet with representatives of different occupations. Tripp later hosted Birthday House, a live (later taped) daily morning children's show on WNBC that aired in New York for four years, starting in 1963. A book of his, The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, was produced as a movie in Rome in 1966, for which Tripp provided the screenplay and played a lead role. Tripp and his wife, Ruth Enders Tripp, used many avenues to engage children in educational activities and collaborated on many educational programs for children. Among those programs, they hosted a TV news magazine for teens titled On The Carousel, which was seen Saturday mornings on the CBS TV network from June 5, 1955 to September 26, 1959. Every week the Tripps would engage their viewers and studio audiences in craftmaking, hobbies, science projects, art, history, and musical and dramatic offerings...including a live presentation of \\"Tubby The Tuba\\". On The Carousel won the NYC Emmy for \\"Best Children's Educational TV Series\\" in 1957. Tripp hosted two children's TV shows - It's Magic! which was seen Saturday nights on CBS TV during the summer of 1955, and he also would serve as the second host and performer of the WOR TV Channel 9 Looney Tunes Show weekday evenings from Monday January 12, 1959 to Friday July 10, 1959. In 1963, Tripp and his wife created Birthday House, on which one fortunate New York area child would get to celebrate his or her birthday with their friends at a fictitious enchanted cottage where the Tripps led them in educational games, introduced them to celebrities, sang songs, and enjoyed gifts and a birthday cake wheeled out toward the end of the show. Birthday House aired from April 1963 through September 1967. It earned WNBC a special award at the 1964 New York City Emmys for quality children's programming. Ruth Enders Tripp died in 1999. Tripp's final recording project was released in 1996 on Angel/EMI Records as Tubby the Tuba and Friends. The orchestral tracks \\"Tubby the Tuba\\", \\"The Story of Celeste\\", \\"Adventures of a Zoo\\", and \\"Peepo the Piccolo\\" were recorded by the Radio Orchestra of Bratislava under the baton of Stephen Gunzenhauser. A final track, \\"Tubby the Tuba Meets a Jazz Band\\", was recorded in New York City with Bob Stewart on tuba, Jimmy Owens on trumpet, Paquito D'Rivera on clarinet, Marco Katz on trombone, Chuck Folds on piano, John Thomas on percussion, and Oliver Jackson on drums. Paul Tripp is the narrator on this recording. Several of the same instrumental tracks appear on a 2006 release called Play it Happy on Koch Records that features Meredith Vieira on \\"Tubby the Tuba\\" and \\"Tubby the Tuba Meets a Jazz Band\\",\\" and Tripp on \\"The Story of Celeste\\". He also acted in other dramas on television, in the theater, and in movies. Among his television appearances were two 1962 roles on the TV series Perry Mason, which starred Raymond Burr. First, he played Howard Langley in \\"The Case of the Lonely Eloper\\"; then, he played Steven Banks in \\"The Case of the Double-Entry Mind\\". Tripp also appeared in The Twilight Zone as an extraterrestrial in \\"The Fugitive\\" (Season 3, Episode 25). However, Tripp's most enduring television role was an episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show, \\"Sally Is a Girl\\". Tripp played the part of Ted Harris, a would-be boyfriend for Sally Rogers. Broadway Tripp's Broadway credits included The 49th Cousin (1960), Seeds in the Wind (1948), Temper the Wind (1946), Army Play-by Play (1943), Jeremiah (1939), An Enemy of the People (1937), and Cyrano de Bergerac (1936).

He is known for his gruff voice, playful lyrics, and fingerpicking guitar style. History Moock's interest in traditional music started at a young age when his father took him to see Pete Seeger and Arlo Guthrie in concert. What he heard and saw that evening affected him strongly. While invigorated by the music, he noticed how the audience became part of the event by joining in the singing. A few years later he discovered Woody Guthrie's Library of Congress recordings. After graduating from Williams College in 1995, Moock moved to Boston and launched his performing career at open mikes and local coffeehouses. In 1997 he released his debut album, Walking Sounds, and followed it with the eight-song mini-album Bad Moock Rising in 1999. By 2002, Moock had traveled extensively throughout the East and Midwest, performing at some of the top listening rooms and outdoor events in the country, including the Newport Folk Festival, the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, the Boston Folk Festival, the Old Town School of Folk Music in Chicago, The Birchmere in Washington D.C., and the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville. In 2003 he made his first trip to Europe, where he performed at the Bergen Music Fest in Norway. Many more European tours would follow, with performances in Norway, France, Germany, Belgium, Poland, the Netherlands, and the UK. Back in the U.S., Moock won some prestigious songwriting competitions, including those at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, Sisters Folk Festival, and the Great Waters Music Festival. Alastair says that he's always been moved by music \\"that connects me to progressive issues and social involvement. It's always been a big part of what I've wanted to do as a musician.\\" That social involvement has resulted in Moock often organizing benefits to help those in need. In May 2007, his album Fortune Street, produced by David \\"Goody\\" Goodrich, was released in the United States and Europe by Corazong Records. In his review of the album for Sing Out!, Scott Sheldon wrote \\"There are no simple songs on Fortune Street; each grapples with hard times, deep feelings, or dramatic moments in history.\\" The album includes two historical ballads: \\"Woody's Lament\\" exploring Woody Guthrie's internal conflict between his family and the pull of the road, and \\"Cloudsplitter,\\" a modal mountain dirge based on Russell Banks' novel about the life of abolitionist John Brown. In 2010, Moock began to turn his attention to performing for kids and families. He has since put out five albums for families which, between them, have earned a GRAMMY nomination, three Parents‚Äô Choice Awards Gold Medals, the ASCAP Joe Raposo Children's Music Award, and first place in the International Songwriting Contest. The New York Times has called him \\"a Tom Waits for kids\\" and The Boston Globe has written that, \\"in the footsteps of Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie, Alastair Moock makes real kids music that parents can actually enjoy.\\" Moock says his album, \\"Singing Our Way Through: Songs for the World‚Äôs Bravest Kids,\\" is the one \\"nearest and dearest to his heart.\\" In July 2012, one of Alastair‚Äôs twin children was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. The Singing Our Way Through project began when Alastair started co-writing songs with her in the hospital. Over the next several months, Moock continued to write and collect songs that reflected his family‚Äôs experiences. Moock decided he wanted to record an album for other families traveling similar paths. With the help of a crowd funding campaign which raised nearly $28,000, he was able to raise the money he needed to make the album he wanted to record. In January 2013, Moock went into the studio with friends and collaborators from the world of Americana music, including Chris Smither, Mark Erelli, Aoife O'Donovan (vocalist for the 2013 Grammy-winning \\"Goat Rodeo Sessions,\\" Best Folk Album), and family music artists Rani Arbo, The Okee Dokee Brothers (2013 Grammy- winners, Best Children's Album), Elizabeth Mitchell (2013 Grammy-nominee, Best Children's Album), and co-producer Anand Nayak. Upon its release in July 2013, \\"Singing Our Way Through\\" was called \\"a masterpiece\\" by Salon.com and was chosen as a \\"Best Kids Music\\" pick by People Magazine.People Magazine, August 2013. Retrieved August 22, 2013. Moock was also interviewed by Katie Couric and on GMA Live (the \\"Good Morning America\\" webcast). Eventually, \\"Singing Our Way Through\\" went on to garner a 2014 Grammy Award nomination. and gold medals from the Parents' Choice Foundation and the National Parenting Publications Awards. With the help of album sales and his crowd funding campaign, Moock has so far been able to send out nearly 3,000 free physical and digital copies to patient families and hospitals around the country. Moock's 2020 album for families, \\"Be a Pain: An Album for Young (and Old) Leaders,\\" is described by Moock's publicity team as: The album features guest performances from a diverse group of musicians including Sol y Canto, Alisa Amador, Reggie Harris, Mark Erelli, Melanie DeMore, Kris Delmhorst, Rani Arbo, Crys Matthews, Sean Staples, Heather Mae, Boston City Singers, and GRAMMY-nominated producer Anand Nayak. On the album's release in March 2020 Nora Guthrie, daughter of folksinger Woody Guthrie and director of Woody Guthrie Publications wrote, \\"How lucky we are to have Alastair Moock around these days! When too many adults are role modeling the pursuit of fame, fortune, or personal gain, Alastair‚Äôs songs encourage our kids to pursue goodness, kindness, awareness and courage. Adults might listen up!\\" Moock once again ran a crowd-funding campaign for this album, raising over $13,000 to allow him to give away free copies of the album, along with free programming on social justice history, to underserved schools in the Boston region and beyond.

In the series, he is a first-year Japanese high- school student who becomes a gofer to avoid being bullied. His running ability improves and he is noticed by Yoichi Hiruma, the American football team's captain, who gets him to join the Deimon Devil Bats as the team's running back under the name \\"Eyeshield 21\\". Sena has appeared in other media from the series, including video games, original video animations (OVAs) and light novels. When he created a protagonist to the series, Inagaki intended to create a \\"wimp\\" who is a good athlete, then he decided the series main theme, American football, and eventually created Sena. In the 2003 anime OVA which preceded the anime series, he is voiced by Romi Park; however, she was replaced by Miyu Irino in the 2005 Japanese anime television series. In the English adaptation, he is voiced by Yuri Lowenthal. Sena has been well received by manga and anime publications. Merchandise has been created for the character, including action figures, cosplay pieces and resin and ceramic statues. Development and voice portrayal When Inagaki was planning the Eyeshield 21 series, he wanted to create a \\"protagonist that was wimpy at the beginning, yet could perform outstandingly in a sports game\\"; from this premise, he choose American football as the main theme, eventually creating Sena. Inagaki has said that he is a fan of the St. Louis Rams and Marshall Faulk (a running back on the Rams). Inagaki said that seeing how Faulk ran inspired him to create the character. He chose Sena's name as an homage to the Brazilian Formula One driver Ayrton Senna. In the first adaptation of the Eyeshield 21 manga, a 2003 Jump Festa OVA titled The Phantom Golden Bowl, he was voiced by voice actress Romi Park. The subsequently adaptation, however, did not use Park; rather Miyu Irino was chosen to be Sena's voice actor. Kokoro Kikuchi provided his voice while his younger self. In the English dubbing, the role has been played by Yuri Lowenthal. Appearances =In Eyeshield 21= Because of his diminutive stature and weak appearance, Sena is bullied by his classmates in primary school; he is protected by Mamori Anezaki, his only friend. A new student, Riku Kaitani, teaches Sena how to outsprint his tormentors. Sena uses his running ability to be a gofer, which allows him to improve his running and dodging ability. Soon after entering senior high school Sena is coerced into playing American football by Yoichi Hiruma, who recognizes Sena's running ability and forces him to join the American football club, the Deimon Devil Bats. To conceal his identity Sena and to keep him from being recruited by other teams, Sena wears a green eyeshield and Hiruma picks the alias \\"Eyeshield 21\\" after a famous Japanese athlete in the United States. The Deimon Devil Bats enter the spring tournament; they lose to the Ojo White Knights, but Sena decides to stay on the team because he finds it fun. They train for the autumn tournament, hoping to be the best team in Tokyo and advance to the Kanto tournament and the Christmas Bowl (between the best high-school American football teams in Japan). Despite Hiruma's desire to keep the identity of Eyeshield 21 a secret, Sena reveals his identity to his teammates when they are training in the United States. He later reveals his identity to Mamori and everyone against Bando Spiders, when Hayato Akaba claims to be Eyeshield 21. Sena eventually beats Akaba, claiming the title of Eyeshield 21. At the Kanto tournament, after defeating Shinryuji Naga, his rival Ojo White Knights' Seijuro Shin, and the Hakushu Dinosaurs, Sena is the tournament's MVP and the Devil Bats win the chance to play in the Christmas Bowl. In the big game, Sena proves his right to the name by defeating Takeru Yamatothe original Eyeshield 21and winning the championship. After winning the Christmas Bowl, Sena is asked to create a national team with Monta, Yamato and Taka Honjo. The four split up to find players for a Japanese team for the International Youth American Football tournament. They advance to the finals against the U.S., and the game ends in a tie. Two years later, Sena plays for Notre Dame in the U.S. during the last half of his last year in Deimon. He returns to Japan to attend Enma College, opposing some of his former teammates (students at other colleges) as they compete to play in the Rice Bowl (the game between the best college American- football teams). =In other media= Sena has made several appearances outside the Eyeshield 21 anime and manga. He appears in both of the original video animations produced for the series: helping the Deimon Devil Bats to defeat the Uraharajuku Boarders in the Golden Bowl in the first OVA, and surviving on a desert island (after Hiruma leaves him and his teammates to train) in the second. As the series' title character, Sena is playable in all Eyeshield 21 games. These usually feature the manga's original story, but Eyeshield 21: Devilbats Devildays features other storylines. In Eyeshield 21: Max Devil Power!, Sena can play for teams other than the Devil Bats. He also appears in the crossover games Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars as a supporting character. Reception The character of Sena has been well received by manga readers and as the series continued he went on to become one of the most popular characters among the Eyeshield 21 reader base, having consistently placed near the top of the Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump character popularity polls of the series. In the first poll he placed first, and second in two others (behind Hiruma). He was also chosen by the readers the one who would win a \\"Stars Showdown\\" against Seijuro Shin, as well as the best running back in the series. In an interview, Miyu Irino said about Sena: \\"he can be pathetic and weak\\" but \\"in case of emergency\\" Sena can be \\"incredibly cool\\". Merchandise based on his character has been released, including action figures, cosplay pieces, and resin and ceramic statues. Several publications for manga and anime have commented on Sena's character. Ain't It Cool News' Scott Green qualified Sena as \\"a rather likable put upon hero and visually interesting lead\\". Carlo Santos of Anime News Network (ANN) noted Sena fell into \\"the archetypal sh≈çnen protagonist\\" and \\"the underdog who falls and gets up over and over again\\" mold, but praised Sena, calling him \\"the polar opposite of those talkative, obnoxious, up-and-at-'em heroes that populate so many other series\\". Writing for Mania.com, Jarred Pine also called Sena an archetypical character but noted him as a \\"very likeable\\" character. Pine praised his debut, saying that it \\"was a memorable one, as it was both intense and hilarious\\". Later, he stated that a lead you can cheer for is essential to a sports manga, commenting that Sena \\"fills that role quite well.\\" The contrast with \\"Sena's hard effort and Hiruma's trickery and devilish nature\\" was also praised by Pine. His doormat characteristics was initially \\"worrying\\" according to Manga Life's Kevin Hill who said he became \\"far more likeable\\" once he meets up Hiruma and Kurita. Zac Bertschy of ANN said that Sena, \\"unlike so many other sh≈çnen sports heroes, stops moping around and doubting himself and generally tries his damndest\\"; he is \\"introspective, kind, and resourceful, something most sh≈çnen heroes can't claim by the third volume of their respective series\\". Chris Homer of The Fandom Post also shared the feeling that Sena is a \\"typical protagonist\\", but remarked how he develops into a more confident character, which \\"is key to the series\\" and makes him \\"a more than acceptable protagonist\\".

In 1831 he became curator at the observatory in Breslau, and was appointed in 1836 to an honorary professorship at the University of Breslau. In the night from 20 April to 21 April 1835, Boguslawski detected a comet, estimated its course, and reported it to Herr Geheimer Ober-Regierungs-Rath. For this, the comet (also known as 1835 I) was named after him. He also did valuable observations and calculations of Biela's, Encke's and Halley's Comets, published contributions in astronomy magazines and participated in the publication of the magazine Uranus from 1842 to his death in 1851.

The group included Communist Party members, and so-called \\"fellow travelers\\" who closely followed the Communist Party's political line without being formal party members, as well as individuals sympathetic to specific policies being advocated by the organization. The League's policy objectives changed over time in accord with the shifting party line of the CPUSA. Beginning as an anti-fascist organization in 1935, the League turned to an anti-war position following the signing of the Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939 and to a pro-war position after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. The organization was prominent in the defense of Republican Spain during the Spanish Civil War and in providing financial and moral support to writers in need in the United States and internationally. The organization was terminated in January 1943. Organizational history =Formation= The League of American Writers was established by the First American Writers Congress, a gathering held from April 26‚Äì28, 1935.\\"League of American Writers,\\" in Special Committee on Un- American Activities, House of Representatives, Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix ‚Äî Part IX, Communist Front Organizations, Second Section. Washington: US Government Printing Office, 1944; pg. 967. (According to member Myra Page, it started on May 1, 1935‚ÄìMay Day. ) The organization was affiliated with the International Union of Revolutionary Writers (IURW) as well as the International Association of Writers for the Defense of Culture and was the American equivalent of the British League of Writers.Franklin Folsom, Days of Anger, Days of Hope: A Memoir of the League of American Writers, 1937‚Äì1942. Niwot, CO: University Press of Colorado, 1994; pg. 29. Initial members included: Alexander Trachtenberg of International Publishers, Franklin Folsom, Louis Untermeyer, Bromfelds, I.F. Stone, Millen Brand, Arthur Miller, Lillian Hellman, and Dashiell Hammett, and Myra Page. In an article in the magazine of the IURW, International Literature, League of American Writers member Alan Calmer noted that the new organization sprung from a decision made at the 1934 convention of the Communist Party's John Reed Clubs: > The chief malady of the revolutionary culture movement was characterized at > the second national conference of the John Reed Clubs in 1934 as the old > malady of sectarianism. ... Pointing to these handicaps, the delegates to > the conference instructed their executive committee to take the initiative > in sponsoring a broad conference of left-wing authors ... A new organization > committee was formed, which gradually involved more and more sympathetic > writers into the leadership of the committee which issued the \\"Call for an > American Writers Congress\\" at the beginning of 1935.Alan Calmer in > International Literature, no. 7, 1935, pp. 73‚Äì75; quoted in Investigation of > Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix ‚Äî Part IX, > pp. 967‚Äì968. The convention call for establishing the first Congress of American Writers declared that capitalism was rapidly crumbling and sought to gather the \\"hundreds of poets, novelists, dramatists, critics, short story writers and journalists\\" who recognized \\"the necessity of personally helping to accelerate the destruction of capitalism and the establishment of a workers' government.\\"Text of the Call for the American Writers Congress of 1935, The New Masses, January 22, 1935, pg. 20. The founding convention of the League was called to order at the Mecca Temple in New York City, attended by 400 invited \\"writer-delegates\\" in front of a total audience of nearly 5,000.Milton Howard, \\"5,000 Greet Writers Who Pledge Fight on Fascism, War: 400 Authors Gather in Parley to Discuss Their Role in Fight\\" The Daily Worker, vol. 12, no. 102 (April 29, 1935), pg. 3. Although later called a \\"front group,\\" the Communist Party's role in the League of American Writers was never secret. Earl Browder, General Secretary of the CPUSA, delivered the keynote address to the delegates of the First Congress of the League of American Writers at its opening session.Earl Browder, \\"Text of Speech by Browder at American Writers Congress,\\" The Daily Worker, vol. 12, no. 102 (April 29, 1935), pg. 3. Browder acknowledged that writers were typically \\"skeptical of all political parties, if not contemptuous.\\" He continued: > They find, however, in the new life in which they participate, there is a > political party which plays an increasingly influential role, the Communist > Party. They find it necessary to define their attitudes towards this Party > which actively participates in their chosen world. They see that this Party > is a force in fine literature, as well as in strikes, in unemployment > struggles, in battling for Negro rights, even in reactionary Congress ... > Yes, the Communist Party is a force, in every phase of the life of the > masses, even that of poets, dramatists, novelists, and critics. Joining Browder in addressing the delegates to the organization's founding convention was CPUSA political committee member Clarence Hathaway, who greeted the Congress in the name of \\"the entire staff of The Daily Worker,\\" the official newspaper of the Communist Party.Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix ‚Äî Part IX, pg. 969. Other leading CPUSA activists addressing the gathering included Moissaye Olgin of the Yiddish-language Morning Freiheit, Joseph Freeman of The New Masses, and Alexander Trachtenberg of International Publishers, part of the CPUSA's publishing arm.Alexander Bloom, Prodigal Sons: The New York Intellectuals and Their World. New York: Oxford University Press, 1987; pg. 400, footnote 56. The group declared itself to be \\"a voluntary association of writers dedicated to the preservation and extension of a truly democratic culture.\\" Waldo Frank was elected the first president of the new organization.Franklin Folsom, Days of Anger, Days of Hope: A Memoir of the League of American Writers, 1937‚Äì1942. Niwot, CO: University Press of Colorado, 1994. The governing Executive Council elected by the first Congress included Frank, Freeman, Trachtenberg, Michael Gold, Granville Hicks, Malcolm Cowley, Josephine Herbst, Albert Maltz, Kenneth Burke, Harold Clurman, Hart, Josephson, Lawson, Scheider, Seaver, Genevieve Taggard and Alfred Kreymborg. =Development= The League of American Writers was a dues based organization, with annual dues set at $5 per year, payable in advance on January 1 of each year.The Bulletin of the League of American Writers, vol. 3, no. 3 (January 1938), pg. 3. Participants who were members of local or regional chapters paid dues to that organization, with $2 of the $5 remitted to the National Office; others stood as members at large and paid dues directly to New York. Although the League of American Writers was technically a \\"mass organization\\" of the CPUSA in the sense that it sought to unite party members with non-party individuals sharing the general Communist Party orientation, membership in the organization was limited by design to the literary elite. Several months after the April 1935 founding congress, membership in the group was reported as only 125 ‚Äî far fewer than the 400 who had attended the founding convention as delegates.Harvey Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism: The Depression Decade. New York: Basic Books, 1984; pg. 353. \\"Applications for membership flow in, but the standard is kept high, membership is granted only to creative writers whose published work entitles them to a professional status,\\" noted Isidor Schneider. According to the group's formal membership application, membership in the League was \\"open to all writers whose work has been published or used with reasonable frequency in channels of communication of more than local scope, including magazines, newspapers, the radio, the stage, and the screen.\\"\\"Application for Membership\\" in The Bulletin of the League of American Writers, vol. 3, no. 3 (January 1938). In addition, members had to accept and observe a set of 7 membership aims: > 1\\\\. To enlist writers in all parts of the United States in a national > cultural organization for peace and democracy and against fascism and > reaction. 2\\\\. To defend the political and social institutions that guarantee > a healthy atmosphere for the perpetuation of culture ... 3\\\\. To stimulate > the interest of other writers in our program ... 4\\\\. To support progressive > trade union organization, especially among professionals and in the liberal > arts. 5\\\\. To effect an alliance, in the interest of culture, between > American writers and all progressive forces in the nation. 6\\\\. To support > the People's Front in all countries. 7\\\\. To cooperate with similar > organizations of writers in other countries. The League of American Writers was governed by Congresses held every two years. The organization also had a number of local chapters which conducted various fundraising activities and events designed to raise public awareness about matters of concern to the League. Chapters were maintained in New York City, Washington, DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and Minneapolis.Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix ‚Äî Part IX, pg. 978. The organization published an official newsletter, The Bulletin of the League of American Writers. A number of prominent writers were enlisted in the cause over the next several years, including Thomas Mann, John Steinbeck, Ernest Hemingway, Theodore Dreiser, James Farrell, Archibald MacLeish, Lillian Hellman, Nathanael West, Elsa Gidlow and William Carlos Williams. The participation of many of these literary luminaries in League affairs was often nominal, limited to signature of an occasional petition. This effort at gathering prominent figures was assisted by a muting the explicitly revolutionary language and communist tone of the organization by the time of its June 1937 second convention.Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism, pg. 354. The 1937 convention was a more subdued affair than the high-profile 1935 launch, with its opening at Carnegie Hall attended by 50 \\"writer-delegates.\\"\\"Writers to Open Congress: Rep. Bernard, Stewart Will Speak at Carnegie Hall,\\" The Daily Worker, vol. 14, no. 133 (June 4, 1937), pg. 1. The keynote speech was delivered by Ernest Hemingway, newly returned from the Spanish Civil War. Hemingway denounced fascism as \\"a lie told by bullies\\" and declared that \\"a writer who will not lie cannot live or work under fascism.\\"Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism, pg. 355. Excerpts from the film The Spanish Earth were shown to the audience. Communist Party General Secretary Earl Browder again spoke to the 1937 convention, emphasizing the CPUSA's \\"Popular Front\\" analysis that the world was divided into \\"two great warring camps, democracy against fascism\\" and leaving it to writers to \\"adjust their own work to the higher discipline of the whole struggle for democracy.\\"Earl Browder, \\"Speech of Earl Browder: Second Congress of American Writers,\\" The Daily Worker, vol. 14, no. 135 (June 5, 1937), pg. 1. Gone was talk of the collapse of capitalism and the duty of writers to speed its demise as participants in the class struggle; now the task at hand, in Browder's view, was the building of \\"broad unity of all democratic and progressive forces ... against the menace of fascist barbarism.\\" Frank was replaced as President of the League in 1937, owing to his questioning of the evidence and verdicts being rendered at the great \\"Show Trials\\" in Moscow.Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix ‚Äî Part IX, pg. 970. He was replaced as President by Donald Ogden Stewart. The professional head of the organization as Executive Secretary from 1937 to 1942 was Communist Party stalwart Franklin Folsom. The League touted seven prominent Vice-Presidents during the last years of the 1930s, including Van Wyck Brooks, Erskine Caldwell, Malcolm Cowley, Paul DeKruif, Langston Hughes, Meridel LeSueur, and Upton Sinclair.Letterhead from July 1939 in Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix ‚Äî Part IX, pg. 976. The 3rd Congress of the League of American Writers, held in New York City in June 1939, once again opened with a Friday night public session at Carnegie Hall. Poet Langston Hughes delivered the keynote address, in which he likened the situation of American blacks to that of the Jewish minority in Germany, with but one difference: \\"Here we may speak openly about our problems, write about them, protest, and seek to better our conditions. In Germany the Jews may do none of those things.\\"Langston Hughes, \\"'We Want America to Really Be America for Everybody,' Says Langston Hughes,\\" The Daily Worker, vol. 16, no. 133 (June 5, 1939), pg. 7. Hughes' speech was broadly democratic and did not include revolutionary sloganeering. =Publications= The League of American Writers somewhat irregularly published a mimeographed newsletter for its members, The Bulletin of the League of American Writers.A virtually complete run of this publication may be found in the League of American Writers Papers at the University of California, Berkeley. This material has been microfilmed and appears at the start of microfilm reel 1. Circulation was small, with a press run of 700 copies cited in an issue from November 1937, and few specimens seem to have survived.\\"An Apology to Californians,\\" The Bulletin of the League of American Writers, vol. 3, no. 2 (November 1937), pg. 16. In 1937 the League of American Writers sent out surveys to over 1,000 American writers asking their position on the Spanish Civil War. Some 418 returned the survey forms, with 410 supporting the Loyalists to the Spanish Republic, 7 professing neutrality, and only one ‚Äî Gertrude Atherton ‚Äî supporting General Francisco Franco and his nationalist forces.Folsom, Days of Anger, Days of Hope, pp. 30‚Äì31. In accord with the CPUSA's political line, no effort was made to contact writers known to be sympathetic to Leon Trotsky. When Max Eastman, a translator of Trotsky and opponent of Joseph Stalin, was inadvertently mailed a survey form, Eastman's reply was excluded at the insistence of Communist Party newspaper editor Moissaye Olgin. The other replies were distilled into a pamphlet published by the League of American Writers, entitled Writers Take Sides. =Decline and dissolution= Theodore Dreiser, photographed in 1933, was the Honorary President of the League of American Writers in 1941. With the signing of the Nazi-Soviet Pact in the fall of 1939, the League of American Writers turned its official policy from one of advocacy of collective security against fascism in Europe to one of opposition to the so-called \\"imperialist war,\\" in accord with a change in the political line of the Communist International and the CPUSA. This abrupt reversal was not cost-free to the organization, however, as series of prominent members of the League of American Writers left the group's ranks. Those exiting during this \\"Yanks Are Not Coming\\" period included Archibald MacLeish, Malcolm Cowley, Van Wyck Brooks, Thomas Mann, and Granville Hicks, among others.Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix ‚Äî Part IX, pg. 971. In January 1940, the League formed a Keep America Out of War Committee. This group's members included: Lillian Hellman, Dashiell Hammett, Lawrence A. Goldstone, Eleanor Flexner, Len Zinberg, Shaemas O'Sheel, and Sonia Raiziss, among others. Theodore Dreiser was honorary president of the League of American Writers in 1941.Franklin Folsom, \\"Notes on Writergate: Harassment against League of American Writers, Monthly Review, May 1995. Published online by CBS MoneyWatch.com The League again abruptly shifted its political position, ending its anti-war stance, with the German invasion of the USSR in the summer of 1941. Echoing another abrupt change of the political line of the CPUSA, the League of American Writers became advocates of American entry into World War II in defense of the Soviet Union. The League of American Writers was terminated in January 1943.Folsom, Days of Anger, Days of Hope, pg. 265.

The Court held that both firms and lawyers have a fiduciary duty of loyalty to their clients and so lawyer or firm cannot represent a client whose interests may be adverse to the interests of another client unless there is consent and a reasonable belief that the interests will not be adverse. This greatly expanded the old rules of conflict of interest which required actual knowledge of confidential information before a lawyer was in conflict. Background David Lloyd Neil was accused of a series of criminal charges. In his prior job he retained the legal services of a solicitor from an Edmonton law firm. Neil's assistant, Helen Lambert, had hired Gregory Lazin from the same firm to represent her in the relation to the charges. Lazin sat in on an interview with Neil's lawyer in order to gain advantage for his client. In a second incident, Lazin was approached by an old client of Neil named Doblanko who believed that Neil had fabricated a divorce document. Lazin referred him to the same police officer who was investigating Neil's other charges. The issue was whether Lazin created a conflict of interest by assisting in establishing the charges against Neil, when he was a past client. Ruling of the Court Justice Binnie, writing for the Court, dismissed the appeal. He held that the firm owed a duty of loyalty to Neil and should not have communicated with the other parties. Binnie used the case as an opportunity to survey the meaning of a lawyer's duty of loyalty. He takes a strong stance, arguing that the duty is an essential to the integrity of the profession and the administration of justice. Loyalty promotes effective legal representation. Impact While the \\"bright-line rule\\" stated in Neil was obiter to the case at hand, in 2007 it became the ratio for determining the later SCC case of Strother v. 3464920 Canada Inc. Although Strother was decided in part by a divided Court, the later case of Canadian National Railway Co. v. McKercher LLP in 2013, decided by a unanimous Court, clarified Canadian jurisprudence in this field.

The Court also found that defendants had failed to establish a good faith effort to fulfil their disgorgement obligations because, among other things, they used available funds for large personal expenses such as courtside seats to Golden State Warriors games, charters of aircraft for personal trips, Goldfarb's mortgage payment and numerous personal vacations, rather than to pay disgorgement.News account of Civil Contempt judgement Philanthropy Lawrence Goldfarb helped launch the Joe Toucan Diabetes Project.

The bus station is on Elder Street, where the buses enter, with pedestrian access also at St Andrew Square. Buses and coaches serve Glasgow, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Perth, Dundee, Aberdeen and Fife. Megabus and National Express also serve the station to destinations that are mainly in England and Wales. The bus station is along with the adjacent Multrees Walk development, which includes Harvey Nichols and many other high-end retailers and was designed by the Edinburgh office of the architectural firm CDA. From May 2014, the bus station has been served by the adjacent St Andrew Square tram stop of Edinburgh Trams, with a direct connection to and from Edinburgh Airport. History St Andrew Square bus station was opened in April 1957 by the operator Scottish Motor Traction, with 16 stances over 5 platforms and underground subways connecting the platforms. By the late 1960s, an office block had been built above the station. Its building supports ate into the platforms and so reduced the available space. The station closed on 2 July 2000, as part of developments of the site, which included a new bus station and Scotland's first Harvey Nichols store.\\"Buses\\", August 2000, vol. 52, no. 545, p. 21, \\"St Andrew's Back to Square one\\", by Gavin Booth. During its reconstruction, a number of issues appeared. Several bus operators complained that the departure fees were too high and planned not to transfer services back into the bus station.Bus firms stall over new station charges, The Scotsman, 14 May 2002. Plans were considered that would have moved the bus station within four years to a new redevelopment at Waverley. In a report to councilors, the director of city development, Andrew Holmes, said: \\"With the delivery of this project now a firm prospect in the next few years, there are potentially opportunities for accommodating integrated facilities for strategic bus services\\".City changes gear over bus station, The Scotsman, 16 May 2002. The new, more modern bus station opened in February 2003, four months late. It was built and is owned by Coal Pension Properties, as part of the redeveloped site, and is leased by The City of Edinburgh Council.Company sued over poor workmanship at ¬£4m bus station, The Scotsman, 10 January 2011. Since the station reopened, major issues have repeatedly arisen. Within days of its opening, bus drivers were complaining that the ramp into the station was too steep and was catching the bottom of their vehicles. That problem was resolved within a week, with minor changes were made to the ramp. In 2003, faulty ceiling tiles had to be replaced to ensure that they did not fall onto passers-by.¬£4m bus station's tiles fall off walls, The Scotsman, 5 September 2003. In 2007, roof planes shut the bus station after they become detached from the roof, which reoccurred with high winds in May 2011. Also in 2007, the offices above the station were flooded, which resulted in the ceiling collapsing and so needing extra support for nearly three years. In 2011, The City of Edinburgh Council took Balfour Beatty to court over their claims of poor workmanship in connection to the bus station because of emergency work that needed to be carried out. One city council source said: \\"A new facility like this should have been much sturdier, even in bad weather.... The council only leases the bus station, but has had to pay to carry out repairs to ensure it is safe enough to open up for passengers. The final designs and work have simply not been up to scratch\\".

Cookies are generally prepared by family members in advance of the reception. It is typically a tradition in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Youngstown, Ohio. Cookie tables are included in primarily Italian, Polish or Catholic wedding receptions. Other groups that also have cookie tables or cookie platters are the Greeks, Slovaks, Serbian Orthodox, Austrian/Hungarian, and Scandinavians. The inclusion of a cookie table is more widely known where those of Italian ancestry settled, and also in some cases, of the other groups mentioned above. Where a settlement did not consist of sizable numbers of Italian or Eastern European groups, the number of those who were familiar with cookie tables decreased. Cookie tables were better known in the east than in the mid-west, south, southwest or west. Research by the Arms Family Museum of Local History in Youngstown discovered the dominant areas for cookie tables were northeastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, including New Castle, Pennsylvania. Cookie tables were also well known in West Virginia, Virginia, New York, New Jersey and Delaware. States where they were unknown or not present included Washington, California, Texas and Nevada.

The Northern Rail Nines group matches, quarter and semi finals were held at the ground in July 2009 with the finals taking place at Bloomfield Road, Blackpool. History Fylde Rugby Club were founded in 1919 and first used the Woodlands for rugby union in May 1920. During the Second World War, the Army took over the ground. In 1946 the President, G.W. Parkes, welcomed back members from the forces and the ground was purchased for ¬£7,000. It was named the Woodlands Memorial Ground in recognition of those members who gave their lives during World War II. In the 1950s, the dressing rooms were erected. It was in 1964 that the second England trial was held at Fylde and Sir Laurie Edwards opened the new pavilion extension. In 1970 the North West Counties played the Fijian Tourists at the Woodlands and attracted a record gate of 7,600. Fylde Rugby Club ran up significant debts in trying to compete in National One in the years 1997-9 and had to sell a small portion of the Woodlands grounds in order to re-establish financial health. With the receipts of the sale, a period of re-development of facilities of all kinds at the Woodlands began in January 2005. The new clubhouse opened in October 2005 and houses 500 people. In June and July Blackpool Panthers played three rugby league games at Woodlands whilst Bloomfield Road was being reseeded. The Blackpool Panthers beat Keighley Cougars and Workington Town and lost to Gateshead Thunder. In October 2006 a contract was signed between the Blackpool Panthers and Fylde R.F.C. for an initial period of six years, covering the seasons 2007‚Äì2012. The administrative and commercial base of the Blackpool Panthers, as well as the National League games moved to the Woodlands Memorial Ground.

Phreatomagmatic eruptions are volcanic eruptions resulting from interaction between magma and water. They differ from exclusively magmatic eruptions and phreatic eruptions. Unlike phreatic eruptions, the products of phreatomagmatic eruptions contain juvenile (magmatic) clasts.Heiken, G. & Wohletz, K. 1985. Volcanic Ash. University of California Press, Berkeley It is common for a large explosive eruption to have magmatic and phreatomagmatic components. Mechanisms Several competing theories exist as to the exact mechanism of ash formation. The most common is the theory of explosive thermal contraction of particles under rapid cooling from contact with water. In many cases the water is supplied by the sea, for example with Surtsey. In other cases the water may be present in a lake or caldera-lake, for example Santorini, where the phreatomagmatic component of the Minoan eruption was a result of both a lake and later the sea. There have also been examples of interaction between magma and water in an aquifer. Many of the cinder cones on Tenerife are believed to be phreatomagmatic because of these circumstances. The other competing theory is based on fuel-coolant reactions, which have been modeled for the nuclear industry. Under this theory the fuel (in this case, the magma) fragments upon contact with a coolant (the sea, a lake or aquifer). The propagating stress waves and thermal contraction widen cracks and increase the interaction surface area, leading to explosively rapid cooling rates. The two mechanisms proposed are very similar and the reality is most likely a combination of both. Deposits Phreatomagmatic ash is formed by the same mechanisms across a wide range of compositions, basic and acidic. Blocky and equant clasts with low vesicle content are formed. The deposits of phreatomagmatic explosive eruptions are also believed to be better sorted and finer grained than the deposits of magmatic eruption. This is a result of the much higher fragmentation of phreatomagmatic eruptions. =Hyaloclastite= Hyaloclastite is glass found with pillow basalts that were produced by non-explosive quenching and fracturing of basaltic glass. These are still classed as phreatomagmatic eruptions, as they produce juvenile clasts from the interaction of water and magma. They can be formed at water depths of >500 m, where hydrostatic pressure is high enough to inhibit vesiculation in basaltic magma. =Hyalotuff= Hyalotuff is a type of rock formed by the explosive fragmentation of glass during phreatomagmatic eruptions at shallow water depths (or within aquifers). Hyalotuffs have a layered nature that is believed to be a result of dampened oscillation in discharge rate, with a period of several minutes.Starostin, A. B., Barmin, A. A. & Melnik, O.E. 2005. A transient model for explosive and phreatomagmatic eruptions. Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research, 143, 133‚Äì51. The deposits are much finer grained than the deposits of magmatic eruptions, due to the much higher fragmentation of the type of eruption. The deposits appear better sorted than magmatic deposits in the field because of their fine nature, but grain size analysis reveals that the deposits are much more poorly sorted than their magmatic counterparts. A clast known as an accretionary lapilli is distinctive to phreatomagmatic deposits, and is a major factor for identification in the field. Accretionary lapilli form as a result of the cohesive properties of wet ash, causing the particles to bind. They have a circular structure when specimens are viewed in hand and under the microscope. A further control on the morphology and characteristics of a deposit is the water to magma ratio. It is believed that the products of phreatomagmatic eruptions are fine grained and poorly sorted where the magma/water ratio is high, but when there is a lower magma/water ratio the deposits may be coarser and better sorted.Carey, R. J., Houghton, B. F., Sable, J. E. & Wilson, C. J. N. 2007. Contrasting grain size and componentry in complex proximal deposits of the 1886 Tarawera basaltic Plinian eruption. Bulletin of Volcanology, 69, 903‚Äì26. Surface features Crest of old tuff ring, including part of the maar crater of a monogenetic volcano, Tenerife, Canary Islands. The maar crater has been used for agriculture. There are two types of vent landforms from the explosive interaction of magma and ground or surface water; tuff cones and tuff rings. Both of the landforms are associated with monogenetic volcanoes and polygenetic volcanoes. In the case of polygenetic volcanoes they are often interbedded with lavas, ignimbrites and ash- and lapilli-fall deposits. It is expected that tuff rings and tuff cones might be present on the surface of Mars.Keszthelyi, L. P., W. L. Jaeger, C. M. Dundas, S. Mart√≠nez-Alonso, A. S. McEwen, and M. P. Milazzo, 2010, Hydrovolcanic features on Mars: Preliminary observations from the first Mars year of HiRISE imaging, Icarus, 205, 211‚Äì29, .Bro≈æ P., and E. Hauber, 2013, JGR-Planets, Volume 118, 8, 1656‚Äì75, \\"Hydrovolcanic tuff rings and cones as indicators for phreatomagmatic explosive eruptions on Mars\\" . =Tuff rings= Tuff rings have a low profile apron of tephra surrounding a wide crater (called a maar crater) that is generally lower than the surrounding topography. The tephra is often unaltered and thinly bedded, and is generally considered to be an ignimbrite, or the product of a pyroclastic density current. They are built around a volcanic vent located in a lake, coastal zone, marsh or an area of abundant groundwater. Koko Crater is an old extinct tuff cone in the Hawaiian Island of Oahu. =Tuff cones= Tuff cones are steep sloped and cone shaped. They have wide craters and are formed of highly altered, thickly bedded tephra. They are considered to be a taller variant of a tuff ring, formed by less powerful eruptions. Tuff cones are usually small in height. Koko Crater is 1,208 feet.USGS: Maars and Tuff Cones Examples of phreatomagmatic eruptions Fort Rock, an eroded tuff ring in Oregon, US. =Minoan eruption of Santorini= Santorini is part of the Southern Aegean volcanic arc, 140 km north of Crete. The Minoan eruption of Santorini, was the latest eruption and occurred in the first half of the 17th century BC. The eruption was of predominantly rhyodacite composition.Taddeucci, J. & Wohletz, K. 2001. Temporal evolution of the Minoan eruption (Santorini, Greece), as recorded by its Plinian fall deposit and interlayered ash flow beds. Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research, 109, 299‚Äì317. The Minoan eruption had four phases. Phase 1 was a white to pink pumice fallout with dispersal axis trending ESE. The deposit has a maximum thickness of 6 m and ash flow layers are interbedded at the top. Phase 2 has ash and lapilli beds that are cross stratified with mega-ripples and dune like structures. The deposit thicknesses vary from 10 cm to 12 m. Phases 3 and 4 are pyroclastic density current deposits. Phases 1 and 3 were phreatomagmatic. =1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo= Fort Rock, as seen from the ground. Mount Pinatubo is on the Central Luzon landmass between the South China Sea and the Philippine Sea. The 1991 eruption of Pinatubo was andesite and dacite in the pre-climactic phase but only dacite in the climactic phase. The climactic phase had a volume of 3.7‚Äì5.3 km3.Rosi, M., Peladio-Melosantos, M. L., Di Muro, A., Leoni, R. & Bacolcol, T. 2001. Fall vs flow activity during the 1991 climactic eruption of Pinatubo Volcano (Philippines). Bulletin of Volcanology, 62, 549‚Äì66. The eruption consisted of sequentially increasing ash emissions, dome growth, 4 vertical eruptions with continued dome growth, 13 pyroclastic flows and a climactic vertical eruption with associated pyroclastic flows.Hoblitt, R. P., Wolfe, E. W., Scott, W. E., Couchman, M. R., Pallister, J. S. & Javier, D. 1996. The climactic eruptions of Mount Pinatubo, June 1991. In: Newhall, C. G. & Punongbayan, R. S. (eds). Fire and Mud; eruptions and lahars of Mount Pinatubo, University of Washington Press, pp. 457‚Äì511. The pre-climactic phase was phreatomagmatic. =Lake Taupo= The Hatepe eruption in 232+/-12 AD was the latest major eruption at Lake Taupo in New Zealand's Taupo Volcanic Zone. There was minor initial phreatomagmatic activity followed by the dry venting of 6 km3 of rhyolite forming the Hatepe Plinian Pumice. The vent was then infiltrated by large amounts of water causing the phreatomagmatic eruption that deposited the 2.5 km3 Hatepe Ash. The water eventually stopped the eruption though large amounts of water were still erupted from the vent. The eruption resumed with phreatomagmatic activity that deposited the Rotongaio Ash.Wilson, C. J. N. & Walker G. P. L. 1985. The Taupo Eruption, New Zealand I. General Aspects.

It is about three girls who live in Washington D.C. who have never met until a priest named Abdel brings them together. They each can cast spells from the Book of Thoth and have the power of transformation. They each have a birthmark in their hair and a ring that the goddess Isis gave them. They are Descendants of Horus. The Sisters have to stop the cult of Anubis from bringing chaos and destruction into the world. If they fail, they will spend eternity with the demons at the edge of chaos. The series is unfinished due to poor sales. The introduction Meri, Sudi, and Dalila are three girls who live in Washington, D.C., but have little else in common. Or so they think. When an ancient magic is revealed, so are their true identities as SISTERS OF ISIS. The Sisters of Isis Sudi Going to high school at Lincoln High, Sudi (starring in The Summoning (Book #1) and The Haunting (Book #4)) is popular and loves to party with her best friend, Sara, who has no idea about Sudi's new life. She has identical twin sisters, Nicole and Carrie, who are three years younger and lives with both of her parents. At first she is reluctant and does not believe in magic but eventually she accepts her fate. In the first book, Brian had broken up with her yet he keeps on showing up whenever she is in trouble. Sudi fears Brian but has not told the other Sisters why. She was born in Nebraska and has blond hair and blue eyes. The animal she can transform into is the Bennu bird. In the third book, Sudi and Scott begin dating. In The Haunting Zack confesses his love to her but she does not know how she feels about him. He said that he only joined the cult because he saw a bird flying over the water and his friends told him that it must be her. He was promised that they would be together. She has the power to move the stars. Her friends, Sara and Brian, find out the truth about who she really is. Meritaten 'Meri' Stark A tomboy, Meri (starring in Divine One (Book #2)) accepted her fate sooner than Sudi did. She is from California and her mother is a senator. She was born in Cairo, Egypt and was an orphan before her mother adopted her. She is named after the daughter of the pharaoh Akhenaton and his wife, the famous beauty Nefertiti. She sometimes has body guards but ever since she discovered her identity, she refuses them. She can transform into and understand cats. She goes to Entre Nous Academy. Her mother illegally adopted her because the day she saw Meri, she felt pulled to her by magic. She has a crush on Abdel and they begin an unofficial relationship. Abdel tells Meri that she was the reason he became an Hour priest. Before she moved to D.C., she was in a girl band but her mother's advisors thought it was inappropriate. Dalila Was raised by her overprotective Egyptologist uncle, Anwar Serenptah. Her parents died in a cave-in when she was seven. She stars in Enchantress (Book #3). She first thought that she was being prepared to marry a king or prince, not fighting ancient gods. She rejects her fate but is the first to accept it. At first she transformed into Ammut but Abdel said she was supposed to shape-shift into a fire-breathing cobra like the goddess Wadjet. She has a shaved head and her birthmark is above her right temple. As of the second book, her hair was grown out to a pixie cut and hid her marking. Is the most knowledgeable about myths and she can belly dance. She has been protected and home-schooled by her uncle. She dates Sudi's friend Carter but he broke up with her because he had joined the cult. He left her for her protection. Book summaries Book #1: The Summoning Sudi is thrilled when she finds a mysterious invitation in her locker. Only one person could have invited her to dinner at Sky Terrace‚Äîher not-so-secret crush, Scott. But when she shows up to meet him, things don't go as planned. Instead of Scott, she finds a strange guy named Abdel, with two girls she's never met before. Abdel claims Sudi and the other girls are the descendants of Egyptian pharaohs, powerful ancestors who have given them magical gifts and powers of transformation. At first, Sudi refuses to buy any of it. But when evil forces begin to threaten her world, she has no choice but to believe. Book #2: Divine One Now that Meri has moved from California to Washington, D.C., her laid-back lifestyle has been given a preppy makeover. Her nose ring and flip-flops have been replaced with a boring gray-and-blue school uniform for the exclusive and ultra-snooty Entre Nous Academy. And with her mom, Senator Stark, deciding to run for her party's presidential nomination, Meri is being forced into the spotlight more than ever. She wants desperately to fulfill her obligations as a Sister of Isis‚Äîbut have things already spun too far out of her control? Book #3: Enchantress Fifteen-year-old Dalila has never lived a normal life. Homeschooled by her uncle and hopelessly sheltered from the outside world, she's used to being different. Lately, Dalila has discovered she has magical powers of transformation and the ability to cast spells from the Book of Thoth. But when Dalila makes a terrible mistake, she finds herself in a race to recover powerful magic. Book #4: The Haunting Strange things are happening to Sudi. And when her date with her new crush Raul turns into a huge disaster, Sudi can't deny the truth anymore‚Äîshe's got a ghost on her hands. But instead of being scared, Sudi sees this as an opportunity; it's like having a special pet that can spy for her and play tricks on her nemesis, Michelle. Only this friendly ghost turns out to be not so friendly, and Sudi quickly discovers that it is actually a mut, one of the dangerous dead who tormented the ancient Egyptians. Sudi, Meri, and Dalila are soon caught up in the spirit's brutal plan to wreak havoc in the world. Will the magic of the Sisters of Isis be strong enough to stop it?

Path Royce Brook does not have a definite starting point, as it consists of several bodies of water flowing into it within its watershed. However, the website for the Royce Brook Watershed states that it starts at the edge of Sourland Mountain at .Stony Brook-Millstone Watershed  Watershed Assessment It tends to run north-east and eventually empties into the Millstone River in Manville at , which is subsequently deposited into the Raritan River. Name The origins of the creek's name is unknown, but there is a street that runs parallel to it in Hillsborough called, \\"Royce Brook Road.\\" Also, there is a local golf club called, \\"The Royce Brook Golf Club.\\" One of the earliest settlers of Hillsborough (other than Lenape) was a man named John Royce. It is documented that during the late 17th century he owned a large piece of land. This land is pretty much what is now the entire town of Manville. Flooding As with the Millstone River, the Royce Brook can flood to extreme heights. The power of Hurricane Floyd was such that it literally changed the landscape surrounding the creek and deposited much sediment into the lands surrounding it. A resident whose backyard borders Royce Brook estimates that during Hurricane Floyd, the average height in that particular area rose at least - compared to its estimated average at . The majority of rainstorms with enough water erode the riverbed and deposit debris and pollution into the river. A storm on 15 April 2007 deposited over of rain into Royce Brook, which was the most recorded since 1882. However, flooding was less severe than during Hurricane Floyd, which deposited approximately 6 to of rain, and therefore resulted in less damage than the April flood. Pollution Royce Brook was tested for pollutants during rainstorms in July and October 2006. Tests included dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate, phosphate, total dissolved solids, electroconductivity, temperature, and pH. It was found to have low dissolved oxygen levels and very high phosphate levels. The researcher of this project suggests that such contamination is from farms or lawns upstream which could be using soils with pesticides on them (which contain phosphates), and the phosphates will flow into Royce Brook during a rainstorm was runoff. High levels of phosphates have been documented as encouraging too many aquatic plants to grow, using dissolved oxygen from the water (limiting it to the fish), which could be the situation in Royce Brook. Additional evidence of high phosphate levels is that the pH of Royce Brook consistently tested as basic, and fertilizers tend to be basic. Also, water flowing over large stones in Royce Brook usually results in large bubbles on the surface of the water, which is usually regarded as a result of high phosphate levels. An earlier research project was conducted in the late summer of 2004, at the same location of where the 2006 testing occurred. It tested for some of the same factors (e.g. DO, nitrate, phosphate, and pH) as the 2006 test; but was not tested during a rainstorm. There were similar results: dissolved oxygen levels were low, phosphate levels were high, and pH levels were basic (even though the pH tested as normal). A high level of pollution exists in Royce Brook, especially rusting iron, soda cans, plastic bottles, and plastic bags which was documented in the research project of the summer 2006.

The four-day sweep of Tsotsin-Yurt erupted into armed clashes with Chechen separatists, ending in a stalemate with disputed casualty figures. Russian forces were accused of widespread human rights violations, including pillaging, ethnic cleansing and forced disappearances. Background The Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (Chechnya) had been de facto independent from Russia since the beginning of the First Chechen War in 1994. During this independence the secular government weakened, and Chechnya came under the increasing influence of warlords and Islamist rule. In August 1999, the War of Dagestan began when Chechen Islamists invaded the Russian state of Dagestan, but were defeated by the Russian military in a month. The War of Dagestan was used as a casus belli to trigger the Second Chechen War, when Russian federal troops entered Chechnya and ended its independence. By June 2000, the war had entered an \\"insurgency phase\\", where Russian troops would perform several day-long zachistka () operations that became notorious for their human rights violations. Operation The operation by the Russian Spetsnaz special forces in Tsostin-Yurt, a large village near Argun south-east of the Chechen capital of Grozny, started on December 30, 2001. Reportedly, an armed conflict broke out and resulted in a disputed number of deaths among combatants and civilians, as well as 11 forced disappearances. The Russian casualties included at least two commandos killed and 11 wounded. Three Chechen rebel fighters who were surrounded in a house were also confirmed killed. The Russian government sources, however, presented the incident as a fierce battle in which 21 to 43 rebel fighters were killed, according to the differing figures by Russian officials.Myths and Truth about Tsotsin-Yurt, Memorial Aftermath =Abuses= According to the Russian human rights group Memorial, the operation was accompanied by gross and massive violations of human rights and of Russian law. Accusations included pillage and wanton destruction of civilian property, desecration of a mosque, massive robberies and extortion, and beatings and torture of around 100 detainees in the \\"filtration point\\", of which 11 were forcibly disappeared and five were found to be brutally murdered. There was also reported use of human shields by the Russian forces. Foreign media sources reported the murders of 37, or even 80, civilians during the course of the operation, but this was not confirmed by the Memorial. According to the April 2002 Amnesty International report, \\"The fate and whereabouts of the 11 people named in the original urgent action, who were detained by Russian security forces during the December 2001-January 2002 raid on Tsotsin-Yurt, is unknown.\\" According to a March 2002 open letter, during the war 41 residents of Tsotsin-Yurt died or disappeared during so-called mopping-up operations, more than 20 died of wounds inflicted by gunfire or bombings, five were killed at checkpoints, six were tortured to death, and 12 were picked up for questioning in their homes, some as long as two years before, and had yet to return.Chechen Village Sends Out Call for Help, The St. Petersburg Times, March 12, 2002 =Other zachistka operations in Tsotsin-Yurt= A zachistka operation had occurred in Tsotsin- Yurt two months earlier in October to November 2001, where Russian troops were accused of abuses again residents. Another zachistka then occurred in the village a month after in February 2002, following an attack on a Russian military vehicle, which also resulting in a various human rights violations, including civilian killings, property destruction and looting.Tsotsin-Yurt residents protested against killing and ‚Äòmopping-up‚Äô operation, Prague Watchdog, February 23rd 2002\\"Mopping Up\\" Operations in the Village of Tsotsin- Yurt, Memorial References Category:Conflicts in 2001 Category:Conflicts in 2002 Tsotsin-Yurt Tsotsin-Yurt Tsotsin-Yurt Category:Battles involving Chechnya Tsotsin-Yurt Category:Mass murder in Russia Category:Mass murder in 2001 Category:Mass murder in 2002 Category:December 2001 events in Asia Category:January 2002 events in Asia ","title":"Tsotsin-Yurt operation"},{"id":"10558430","text":"Polylepis australis, also known locally as tabaquillo or que√±oa is a tree endemic of central Argentina, member of the family Rosaceae. The genus Polylepis originated in the eastern South America, Andean forests. The plant has small, pinnate leaves, 7‚Äì10 cm long, normally composed of five or seven leaflets. In harsh winters, Polylepis australis survives by producing rolls of loose, papery like exfoliating brownish bark; the rough outer covering of the woody stem of tree. The southernmost stands of Polylepis australis are located in the high C√≥rdoba mountains of central Argentina (1,200‚Äì2,884 m above sea level). South American Polylepis mountain forests are recognised as being one of the most endangered forest ecosystems in the world. During a reforestation project, D. Renison (University of C√≥rdoba, Argentina) found that the germination of Polylepis australis stands decreases significantly with decreasing tree coverage. The first results of additional studies carried out in collaboration with Isabell Hensen (University of Halle, Germany) indicate that a clear negative correlation exists between the viability of seeds of Polylepis australis and the degree of human influence on the woodland stands. Seeds of Polylepis australis exhibited a great variation in terms of mass and percent seed germination among individual trees and among geographical regions.

Education Cadieux was born in Montreal, Quebec in 1955.https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/women/030001-1154-e.html She received her BA in Visual Arts from University of Ottawa. Teaching * Concordia University, 1991 ‚Äì present; * Guest professor, √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, 1994; * √âcole nationale des beaux-arts in Grenoble, 1996; Works Genevi√®ve Cadieux is a photographer who frequently works with audio- visual materials in her large-scale public installations in urban settings. Cadieux's work confronts identity, gender, and the body. She presents the body as a landscape, focusing on small details close-up, such as mouths, bruises, and scars. Cadieux's early career was mainly in film photography. Her 1989 work, Hear Me With Your Eyes, was featured at the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery and consisted of large-scale photographic prints of a woman displaying sexually evocative facial expressions. Over time, Cadieux's work has shifted to integrating video and audio content, such as her Broken Memory. The piece employed glass sculpture representative of the human body and a recorded reading of a 17th-century poem by Sister Juana In√©s de la Cruz. A notable video work by Cadieux was included as the inaugural piece of the 2002 The 59th Minute: Video Art on the Times Square Astrovision, an undertaking by Creative Time and Panasonic wherein the 59th minute of each hour of the day saw an artistic image in place of regular programming. Cadieux's Portrait celebrated the regeneration and renewal of spring, featuring footage of a solitary tree, a lonely survivor of the 1998 ice storm in Montreal. La Voie Lact√©e, 1992 One of Cadieux's most prominent works is her 1992 piece La Voie lact√©e, a photograph of a woman's red lips displayed on the rooftop of the Mus√©e d'art contemporain de Montr√©al. It has since become an icon of Montr√©al. In 2011, a sister piece, La Voix lact√©e, was commissioned by the Soci√©t√© de transport de Montr√©al as a gift for the Paris Metro, in exchange for the Hector Guimard Parisian metro entrance at Square-Victoria-OACI station. Based on the theme of the French language binding France and Quebec, it features a mosaic reproduction of La Voie lact√©e, accompanied by a poem by Anne H√©bert. It was installed at Saint-Lazare station. In 2019, her work FLOW/FLOTS was unveiled at Rideau station of the O-Train, Ottawa.

It consists of Piers 1, 1¬Ω, 3 and 5, is one of the largest surviving pier complexes along San Francisco's Embarcadero. The Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 20, 2002. Construction With construction spanning over a decade and led by Chief Engineer of the State Harbor Commission, Frank G. White, Piers 1, 1¬Ω, 3 and 5, were opened in 1918. Unlike the piers south of the Ferry Building that were designed in the Mission and Gothic Revival styles, the piers north of the Ferry Building were built in the Beaux-Arts architecture style, similar to New York City's Chelsea Piers. The timber-frame bulkhead buildings, covered in stucco, are each two stories high, punctuated by two-story arches. Behind these formal building are the areas more closely associated with the functioning of the port--the piers and transit sheds. Concrete or timber piers extend east behind the bulkhead buildings, connected to the system of wharves upon which the bulkhead buildings rest. Steel truss and timber frame buildings, accommodating the loading and unloading of ships are built upon the piers, with open aprons for circulation. Early history These were the only group of piers in the Port of San Francisco dedicated chiefly to inland trade and transport. These connections facilitated the growth of communities in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys and fostered California's agricultural business that led the state to become the richest in the nation, as well the fifth largest economy in the world. The Delta King and Delta Queen provided overnight connections between San Francisco and Sacramento from Pier 1¬Ω, making it an important gateway for public travel to the interior of the state. Pier 3 and Pier 5 served primarily freight shipping, with a variety of companies sharing the bulkhead office and warehouse spaces and the huge transit sheds which originally extended the full length of the finger piers for more than 700 feet (212 m) east from the wharf on the Embarcadero. World War II The San Francisco waterfront piers played a crucial role in the Pacific theater during World War II. With the outbreak of the war, San Francisco's waterfront became a military logistics center; troops, equipment and supplies left the Port in support of the Pacific theater. Almost every pier and wharf was involved in military activities, with troop ships and naval vessels tied up all along the Embarcadero. In addition, the military briefly set up antiaircraft guns and searchlights at piers along the waterfront from 1941 to 1942. The Coast Guard, Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Maritime Service Enrolling Office occupied Pier 5. Modern times After the war, the piers fell into disuse, as ports in Oakland, Alameda and Richmond were better equipped to respond to the conversion to containerization. Piers 1¬Ω and 5 were early examples of finding new uses for buildings which form a valuable part of the city's environment. The former Passenger Waiting Room of Pier 1¬Ω was converted into an architect's waterfront office, and the bulkheads of Piers 1¬Ω and 5 were used as professional office space. While many of the piers were demolished, Piers 1 ¬Ω, 3 and 5 remain the most visible from the Ferry Building and Market Street, still the main thoroughfare of the city. In January 2001, San Francisco based Pacific Waterfront Partners, LLC was selected by the Port of San Francisco to redevelop the historic Piers 1¬Ω, 3 and 5. The project focuses on preserving and rehabilitating the historic maritime design of the Northeast Waterfront and the Ferry Building Waterfront while enhancing the public use and access to the historic and scenic waterfront setting.

It was the 381st listed operation during the Iraq war in 2003List of coalition military operations of the Iraq War Black Eagle was an operation in which U.S. Polish, and Iraqi troops battled gunmen loyal to anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr in the town of Al Diwaniyah, which is the capital of Iraq's Al-QƒÅdisiyyah Governorate, for control of the city. U.S. warplanes targeted insurgent positions with Hellfire missiles in and near the city. As of 7 April 2007, Iraqi officials have verified six insurgents killed and 39 captured. On 10 April 2007, combat operations had been declared to have ended and the operation continued into the reconstruction phase. There is no relation to Operation Black Eagle II that took place in January 2007. Overview Operation Black Eagle took place in the city of Al Diwaniyah. This city is the capital of Al-QƒÅdisiyyah Governorate. The population of it was estimated to be around 500,00 people. It is currently the 14th most populated city in all of Iraq. It was the location of an insurgent uprise that was to be neutralized. Operation Black Eagle's intention was to disrupt militia activities that were being armed with illegal weapons. It was in response to violence in the area that threatened to destabilize the region. At 6:30 AM, forces began to enter the city and start their mission. They were able to detain 39 militia personnel. On Day 2, they were able to seize an unspecified number of weapon caches. The caches included 27 90mm rockets, six claymore mines, five crates of C-4 explosives, eight explosively formed projectiles, four EFP cones and other EFP-making materials, one roll of detonation cord, 14 hand grenades, 12 blasting caps for explosives, six rolls of copper wire, one global positioning system, 13 fully loaded AK-47 ammunition magazines, 900 PKC machine gun ammunition rounds, two PKC machine gun barrels, one PKC machine gun butt stock, one mortar system sight, and five ballistic vests.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2007/04/mil-070407-mnfi01.htm On April 10, the final day of the operation, citizens in the city were to be given more unrestricted movement and the cordon around the city would be opened up for them.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/oif-black- eagle.html Participants 4 countries were a part of the conflict in Al Diwaniyah. The United Kingdom were not heavily involved in this operation. Poland forces helped slightly and one Polish soldier was KIA. American forces included 1st squadron 14th Cavalry Regiment of 3rd brigade, 2nd infantry division and the 0800 Military Transition Team. These Teams took charge of the operation and with the help of the 8th Iraqi Special Forces division and the Multi-National Division-Baghdad, saw to its completion. The 8th Iraqi Special Forces unit was voted as one of the best Iraqi units.https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03IRAQ-t.html The group that opposed those forces were the Mahdi Army, an army of revolutionary Shi'ite Muslims. The American forces had 6 soldiers die, while the Iraqi Special Forces had 29 soldiers killed. On the other side, the Mahdi Army had 25 of its members killed and 39 insurgents were captured. Aftermath Immediately after the conclusion of the operation, the city felt much more regulated. Those that were members of the militia were no longer in the city, as they were detained or were killed. Insurgents tended to use car bombs as a way to assault American or Iraqi forces. The seizure of some of those bombs and explosive devices were instrumental in thwarting the incoming attacks. In mid- May however, heavy fighting erupted in the city.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/iraq_casualties_may07.html On 11 August 2007, a roadside bomb hit the convoy of the governor of Diwaniya, Khalil Jalil Hamza, killing him along with the province's police chief Brigadier Khalid Hassan.Aswat Aliraq See also *Operation Lion's Leap List of coalition military operations of the Iraq War References External links *Multi National Force Iraq Website *Defense America *CNN *Defenselink *Central Comman Website Category:Military operations of the Iraq War in 2007 Category:Military operations of the Iraq War involving the United States Category:Military operations of the Iraq War involving Iraq Category:Military operations of the Iraq War involving Poland Category:April 2007 events in Asia ","title":"Operation Black Eagle"},{"id":"10558569","text":"Nora Gal (1927) Nora Gal (), full name Eleonora Yakovlevna Galperina (, April 27, 1912 in Odessa - July 23, 1991) was a Soviet translator, literary critic, and translation theorist. Biography She was born on April 27, 1912 in Odessa. Her father was a medical doctor and her mother a lawyer. As a child, she moved to Moscow with her family. After several unsuccessful attempts she was admitted to the Lenin Pedagogical Institute, from which she graduated. She then completed her post-graduate studies with a thesis on the French poet Arthur Rimbaud and published articles on classical and contemporary foreign literature (Guy de Maupassant, Byron, Alfred de Musset). She married literary critic Boris Kuzmin and later became editor of his selected works. When she was still a schoolgirl she published some poems, while during her student years she switched to prose. Towards the end of the 1930s, she wrote many articles on contemporary foreign literature. She started her active career as a translator during World War II, and after the war she devoted herself to translating authors such as Jules Renard, Alexandre Dumas, p√®re and H. G. Wells. In the 1950s, she translated \\"Le Petit Prince\\" by Antoine de Saint- Exup√©ry, novels by J.D. Salinger, and \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" by Harper Lee into Russian. She became a widely respected and prominent translator. In the last period of her activity she tackled such masterpieces as \\"The Stranger\\" by Albert Camus and \\"Death of a Hero\\" by Richard Aldington, as well as books by Thomas Wolfe, Katherine Anne Porter, and by a number of science fiction authors, including Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke, Roger Zelazny and Ursula K. Le Guin. In 1972, she wrote Words Living and Words Dead (–°–ª–æ–≤–æ –∂–∏–≤–æ–µ –∏ –º—ë—Ä—Ç–≤–æ–µ), a manual on voice that contains numerous examples of translation, both good and bad. There, she challenged conventions and advocated lively word choice and sentence structure over passive, cluttered, and official tone, simplicity and flow over the accepted heavy, cold, and technical style; if it makes more sense but sounds rustic, then so be it. It was subsequently revised and had been reprinted four times by 1987. It has recently been reprinted twice in 2001 and 2004.

Carpal boss VR-3D-Reconstruction Carpometacarpal bossing (or metacarpal/carpal bossing) is a small, immovable mass of bone on the back of the wrist. The mass occurs in one of the joints between the carpus and metacarpus of the hand, called the carpometacarpal joints, where a small immovable protuberance occurs when this joint becomes swollen or bossed. The joint between the index metacarpal and the capitate is a fibrous non-mobile joint. Some people have a gene that leads to this growth. It looks like arthritis (bone spurs on each side of the joint) on X-ray. It looks like a ganglion on the hand, but more towards the fingertips.  Clinical significance  The carpometacarpal joint is usually found at the base of the second and third metacarpal bones at the point where they meet the small bones of the wrist. Bosses are usually painless and will never cause more than a slight ache. They tend to be of manageable size, but on occasion the extensor tendons can slide over the bump, which can be annoying. Sometimes there is a ganglion cyst along with the boss. Often, this condition will be mistaken for a ganglion cyst because of its location and external appearance. Carpometacarpal boss is uncommon and there is not much scientific data. Its etiology has yet to be fully defined, but can be congenital in the form of an accessory ossicle (os styloideum) or may be acquired from trauma, repetitive use, or degenerative osteophytosis. The condition usually begins to show in the 3rd or 4th decade.

The band was based in Los Angeles and existed from early 1975 to October 1976. Though the group was short-lived and never released a proper full-length album, they are known for being led by guitarist Ron Asheton of The Stooges. History After The Stooges imploded in 1974, former Stooges lead guitarist Ron Asheton formed a new band, ultimately acquiring drummer Dennis \\"Machine Gun\\" Thompson, bass player Jimmy Recca and keyboardist Scott Thurston. For a while, the new band shared rehearsal space at a house owned by Ray Manzarek, during his collaboration with Stooges' lead singer Iggy Pop. When The New Order's first singer Jeff Spry was forced to quit the band (due to jail time incurred from a drinking/quaalude related DUI coupled with failure to perform community service), The New Order's first drummer, K.J. Knight, recommended Dave Gilbert as a replacement. K.J. and Gilbert had both been veterans of the 1971/1972 incarnations of Ted Nugent's Amboy Dukes. After keyboardist Scott Thurston quit, his position was filled by a second guitarist, Ray Gunn, another Detroit veteran who was recommended by Dennis Thompson. Leading up to the making of The New Order's first demo tapes, long time Blue √ñyster Cult producer, Sandy Pearlman, was approached to produce the band but ultimately this didn't come together. The back cover of the Declaration of War album bears the inscription: \\"This album is dedicated to the CULT\\", furthering the links with the Blue √ñyster Cult. A projected collaboration with '60s and '70s rock impresario, Kim Fowley, was also talked about, but never came to fruition. After The New Order After The New Order, Asheton and Thompson formed New Race with Radio Birdman's lead singer Rob Younger, lead guitarist Deniz Tek and bass player Warwick Gilbert. This band started and ended in 1981, with no studio material recorded, but three live albums released, with two of the three first released on Revenge Records, then re-released recently on Vivid Sound Corporation. Some years after leaving The New Order, singer Jeff Spry and his guitarist brother, Joe Spry, formed the new wave band, Felony, which had a much played 1983 hit song (\\"The Fanatic\\") on the influential Los Angeles radio station, KROQ-FM. The song was featured on the soundtrack to the 1983 movie, Valley Girl. A video was made from \\"The Fanatic\\" \\"The Fanatic\\" video was shot in Hollywood, California in 1983 and aired on MTV. The Fanatic video includes a cameo of Jeffrey Spry with his first wife, SAG actress, Lucrecia Sarita Russo. On March 9, 1991, Jeff Spry shot himself, leaving behind his second wife, Tamara and daughters, Desirae & Natasha. His real name was Jeffrey Scott Spirelli. Following The New Order's split in the fall of 1976, Dave Gilbert eventually joined The Rockets, a band formed in 1972 out of Mitch Ryder and The Detroit Wheels. The Rockets recorded six albums, on three major labels, from 1977 to 1983. Dave Gilbert died in 2001 from cancer of the liver after a lifetime struggle with drugs and alcohol addictions, although he had embraced sobriety sometime before being diagnosed with cancer. Discography =First album and Declaration of War= The New Order recorded demos twice in Los Angeles: First in 1975 with Jeff Spry as lead singer and then in 1976 with Dave Gilbert as lead singer. Both recordings were later released with a production by Neil Merryweather in 1977 as a single album \\"The New Order\\", on the Fun Records/Isadora label and distributed by RCA Records. The album's lo- fi quality was the result of it being produced from Ron Asheton's inferior cassette copies, instead of the original master tapes. The album was later reissued with different cover art and a bonus track as Declaration of War in 1987. Declaration of War was reissued again in 1991, this time on CD. =Victim of Circumstance= In 1989, Victim of Circumstance was released on vinyl and CD on the Revenge Records label. This release consisted of eight unreleased rehearsal recordings, with side one of the original vinyl release presented as four bonus tracks on the CD version. In April 2008, the CD was re-released on the Japanese import label, Vivid Sound Corporation. This new release has the same title and track listing as Victim of Circumstance, but has the same cover art as the original 1977 vinyl release - although \\"The New Order\\" logo's font has been revamped and changed. Vivid Sound Corporation also re-released the second and third live albums by the related Ron Asheton/Dennis Thompson band, New Race.

The film stars Carmen Maura, Andr√©s Pajares, and Gabino Diego as a trio of travelling players performing for the Republic, who inadvertently find themselves on the nationalist side during the closing months of the Spanish Civil War. The film was selected as the Spanish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 63rd Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Plot Carmela, Paulino, and Gustavete - who is mute as the result of an explosion - are a trio of travelling vaudeville performers. Amidst the chaos of the Spanish Civil War, they are in the town of Montejo, entertaining republican troops with their variety show. They are survivors who are motivated, not exactly by patriotism, but by a desire for self-preservation. Their show consists of four acts. It begins with Carmela singing and dancing a traditional song. The audience is enthusiastic during her performance, but the mood changes completely when the sound of approaching nationalist planes is heard. As the planes fly overhead, Paulino reads a poem by Antonio Machado which introduces a note of patriotic fervour in accordance with republican feeling in 1938. The seriousness of the moment is followed by a comic routine in which Paulino twists himself into a variety of ridiculous postures in an attempt to break wind. The fourth and final act is a 'tableau vivant' in which Carmela represents justice while Paulino brandishes the republican flag and they sing a song of freedom. The dangers and deprivation that they encounter in the republican side encourage the trio to go to Valencia. To obtain gasoline for the trip Carmela has to distract a republican truck driver while Paulino and Gustavete steal the fuel. They make this difficult journey on a misty night and inadvertently end up in nationalist territory. They are detained by a nationalist officer and are incriminated by the republican flag they carry amongst their props. They are arrested and taken as prisoners to the local school, which serves as a prison camp where the republicans are held. Carmela befriends a fellow prisoner: a Polish soldier member of the International Brigade and is surprised that he has come to fight in Spain, a foreign land whose name he cannot even pronounce. In an atmosphere of mounting tension and terror, some of the prisoners are taken away to be shot. Carmela, Paulino and Gustavete are driven away in an army car. They are convinced that they are also going to be killed, but instead they are taken to the local theatre where they meet an Italian officer, Lieutenant Amelio di Ripamonte. Surprisingly, the lieutenant, learning that they are performers, wants them to take part in a show he has been planning to entertain the nationalist troops. They must stage a burlesque of the Republic in exchange for their freedom. For the variety show that they are to perform to the nationalists, Paulino rewrites their old script. From the outset, the fiery and patriotic Carmela is defiant and unwilling to go along with it, displaying her true convictions as an anti- fascist. However, Paulino persuades her that since their lives are at stake she must collaborate in the performance of the now anti-republican numbers. On the day of the show, both artists are indisposed as Carmela has her period and Paulino has an upset stomach from eating a rabbit which Gustavete, writing on his slate, now confirms to have been a cat. The presence of the Polish prisoners, who have been brought to witness a mockery of their ideals, greatly upsets Carmela, and she initially refuses to perform a number involving the republican flag. Structurally, the show is largely similar to the one they used to perform for the republican troops. Musical numbers are followed by a poem, now read by the lieutenant. The third act involves a comic sketch, \\"The Republic goes to the Doctor\\". In this simplistic parody, Paulino plays a gay republican doctor who is visited by a female patient, the Spanish Republic, played by Carmela. She claims that she has been made pregnant by a Russian lover, played by Gustavete. In a number which gives full scope to all the possible sexual innuendos the audience cares to imagine, Carmela invites the doctor to insert his thermometer in her, to which he refuses, making the excuse that it is broken. Carmela, increasingly irritated by the mockery of the Republic and enervated by the presence of the Polish soldiers, gradually loses heart in her performance, and her frustration at the mockery of the ideals she holds dear seethes to the surface jeopardizing the credibility of the parody. The sketch quickly disintegrates as the Polish soldiers begin to rebel in the galleries and the fascists become infuriated. The scene comes to a climax as Carmela starts singing 'Ay Carmela' and lowers the republican flag to expose her breasts in defiance of the earlier cries of 'Whore!' from the audience. A nationalist officer then emerges from the stalls, raises a pistol and shoots Carmela in the forehead. Gustavete suddenly recovers his voice, calling out in anguish, but Carmela falls to the floor dead. The next scene shows Paulino and Gustavete visiting Carmela's rudimentary grave which they decorate with flowers and the latter's chalk board, now redundant since Gustavete regained his voice when Carmela was shot. The only words here are spoken by Gustavete ‚Äì \\"Come on, Paulino\\" ‚Äì as he leads him away. The two men take to the road again and the song \\"¬°Ay Carmela!\\" rises in the background closing the film as it had begun and taking it into the credits. Cast * Carmen Maura as Carmela * Andr√©s Pajares as Paulino * Gabino Diego as Gustavete * Mauricio De Razza as Lieutenant Ripamonte * Jos√© Sancho as Captain Production  Made in 1990, ¬°Ay Carmela! was director Carlos Saura‚Äôs twenty- third, feature-length film and, in his own words, the first in which he was able to treat the subject of the Civil War with any kind of humour: \\"I would have been incapable a few years ago of treating our war with humour‚Ä¶ but now it is different, for sufficient time has passed to adopt a broader perspective, and here there is no doubt that by employing humour it is possible to say things that it would be more difficult, if not impossible, to say in another way\\".Edwards, Indecent Exposures, p. 116 In Saura's earlier films, allusions to the war and to its consequences were characterized by violence and brutality, and if there was any humour at all it was grim and ironic. Despite the fact that the action in ¬°Ay Carmela! is set fully in the War, Saura's treatment of it employs comic effects, including farce. The film is based on the play of the same name by the Valencian dramatist, Jos√© Sanch√≠s Sinisterra. The play was a success in Spain and was translated to English and staged in London.Edwards, Indecent Exposures, p. 130 The play focuses entirely on the two principal characters, Carmela and Paulino, and tells their story largely in flashback. When it begins, Paulino is alone and depressed, for Carmela is already dead, the victim of a fascist bullet at their last performance as variety artist. In the first part of the play Carmela returns as a ghost to converse with Paulino, blaming him for all that has happened, and in the second part evokes in detail the fatal performance. The play contains only two characters and a single setting.Edwards, Indecent Exposures, p. 117 Saura adapted the play with the help of scriptwriter Rafael Azcona who had worked with him many times before but with whom he had broken in 1975 prior to the making of Cria Cuervos. Saura opened up the story and presented it not in flashback but in a linear manner. This allowed Saura to follow the journey of Carmela and Paulino during the two days in which they travel from Republican to Nationalist territory, performing their act in both camps. It also allowed much more scope for the relationship and the characters of Carmela and Paulino to evolve and in relation to the events in which they find themselves caught up. It also enable Saura to depict other characters and locations which are mentioned in the play, in particular, Gustavette, the traveling companion of Carmela and Paulino, and the Italian officer and theatre director, Lieutenant Amelio di Ripamonte. The town where the action occurs and the theatre in which the final third of the film is located are also depicted. Some artistic resonance evoke memories of Ernst Lubitsch's 1942 comedy To Be or Not to Be.Schwartz, The Great Spanish Films, p. 102 The film takes its title from the song \\"Ay Carmela\\", which begins and ends the film. Originally a song from the War of Independence against Napoleon, it had been adapted and became the favourite song of the Republican soldiers and of the International Brigade during the Spanish Civil War.

She was president of the committee of the Lady Northcote Free Kindergarten for ten years (1928‚Äì1938) and joined the executive of the Free Kindergarten Union (FKU), becoming president in 1939. In 1940, she was 'headhunted' by the Australian Red Cross Society, when they asked her to become its principal commandant. In this capacity, she travelled widely, both inspecting and establishing Red Cross services and activities. She resigned from this position in 1946 and immediately resumed her presidency of the FKU, picking up where she left off as an energetic leader who tirelessly lobbied the government for greater support for pre- school training. Ill health forced her to resign in 1949, but she maintained her interest and activism in the area of early childhood development. She died in 1973, aged 84, leaving large bequests to the organisations she supported in her lifetime: the FKU, the Australian Red Cross and the Anglican Church.

Personal history Just as the 1980s marked the return of Aerosmith -- \\"one of the most dramatic comebacks ever in rock\\"Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times‚Äîthey also underlined the rise to prominence of the band's personal manager, Tim Collins. At the age of 14, Collins joined a band called Tax Free.Band later renamed itself to Connection Playing guitar in the band, Collins also took responsibility for booking gigs for the band and handling their finances. While playing in the band and going to school, Collins worked full-time at Anderson-Little as a clothing salesman and used the money he earned to buy the band a sound system and a truck. When Tax Free replaced Collins in 1970, they told Collins that \\"you make a better manager than a guitarist\\" and asked Collins if he would manage them.Waltham News Tribune Now the Daily News Tribune Before ‚ÄúTax Free‚Äù, Tim had formed the band ‚ÄúValley Decision‚Äù; with Tim on Guitar, John Voymus on keyboard, Kevin Wormsley on drums and Bill Walsh on bass guitar. All the members of the band attended St. Mary‚Äôs High School in Waltham, Massachusetts. Named after a Walt Whitman poem,‚ÄùVD‚Äù even competed in a Battle of the Bands in Waltham, Massachusetts‚Äîat least, they did not come in last! By this point, Collins graduated from Bentley College in Waltham, Massachusetts, where he majored in Organizational Behavior and Marketing. As he continued to manage Tax Free, Collins opened Bands Unlimited Productions, which booked local talent in the Boston area that played all of the local colleges and night clubs. In 1977, he signed The Fools,The Fools official website a young rock band with a novel edge. They rose to high regional prominence very quickly. In order to gain the clout to develop them, he moved to New York City in 1978 to work for Castle Music Productions Inc., where he brought The Fools. Collins worked for artist manager Peter Casperson, known for his work with some of the great folk-rock artists of the era including Jonathan Edwards, Martin Mull, Orphan, and Duke and the Drivers.Duke And The Drivers Official Website While working at Castle Music,the company managed to get The Fools signed to EMI Records. The Fools, with the support of the larger organization at Castle Music, experienced success with the hits \\"Psycho Chicken\\" and \\"It‚Äôs a Night for Beautiful Girls\\". In 1979, \\"Psycho Chicken\\", an X-rated parody of The Talking Heads' \\"Psycho Killer\\", exploded over the airwaves of Boston. The band was so excited that they followed up almost immediately with another hit, \\"It's a Night for Beautiful Girls\\". Shortly thereafter, EMI Records signed the band and sent them to tour the U.S. with The Knack. \\"The tour was a smashing success.\\" After the tour, the band headed to Miami to record their debut album Sold Out. Collins also met Jonathan Edwards, who is known for his million selling hit \\"Sunshine.\\" Collins left Castle Music on April 1, 1979 and started Collins/Barrasso Agency. Steve Barrasso, his new partner, was a local Boston musician whose musical career with a band called Calamity Jayne was cut short by a lung condition. Thankfully, though, the two met and Steve convinced Tim to leave Castle and start their own business. The Collins/Barrasso Agency established its headquarters in Allston, MA. The Collins/Barrasso Agency became the place to be for New England-based regional recording artists. Some of the many talented musicians who were on the roster included Jonathan Edwards, Aztec Two- Step,Aztec Two-Step Official Website The James Montgomery Blues Band,James Montgomery Duke and the Drivers,On Facebook: Duke and the Drivers Orleans,Official Site Orleans and many others. They also produced and procured talent from the major agencies for college shows and larger concert venues throughout New England. History with Aerosmith In the early 1980s, Tim Collins worked as the manager for The Joe Perry Project, the solo project created by guitarist Joe Perry who had left Aerosmith in 1979. In 1984, Collins orchestrated the reformation of the original Aerosmith. He succeeded when guitarists Joe Perry and Brad Whitford rejoined the band in April 1984. He believed he could make Aerosmith the biggest band in the world by 1990, if he reformed the original band and helped to orchestrate an intervention on the band members that led to them getting clean and sober. Aerosmith officially reformed in May 1984 and hired Collins as their manager. After every major record label passed on signing Aerosmith to a recording contract in the summer of 1984, Collins, with the help of the infamous music attorney Brian Rohan, inspired legendary A&R; man John Kalodner to sign Aerosmith to Geffen Records. The band toured extensively and created their first album after the reunion of the classic lineup in 1985, titled Done with Mirrors. However, the album was not the success they had hoped for, the band was not receiving mainstream publicity, and the drug addictions of the band members and their attempts to quit drugs on their own weren't working. Collins and his team, with the help of Dr. Louis Cox PhD. of New York City, orchestrated a drug and alcohol intervention on lead singer Steven Tyler. Tyler entered a drug rehabilitation program at the Caron Foundation in Pennsylvania that was extremely successful for him. The rest of the band members followed suit shortly thereafter. One of the major things Collins had Aerosmith agree to was the appearance of Tyler and Perry on Run-DMC's cover of Aerosmith's song \\"Walk This Way\\". The collaboration and subsequent video made Aerosmith a household name again and opened the band up to a new generation. By the time their next album, Permanent Vacation, was released in 1987, all of the band members had gotten clean, and Collins was now working hard to make sure the band won their fame back, through his namesake \\"Collins Management\\". By this point in time, Kalodner and Collins had forged a creative partnership that was a winning combination. They enlisted the help of top-notch outside songwriters and producers to work with the band in recording their albums, had the band touring the world extensively with up-and-coming acts opening for the band, including the (then soon to be) legendary Guns N' Roses, he enlisted the help of top-notch music video directors, and was now having the band make numerous appearances in television, movies, video games, major festivals, and the like, helping to win over a new generation of fans, while retaining their old fanbase. Between 1987 and 1994, Aerosmith released three albums and a compilation album (Permanent Vacation, Pump, Get a Grip, and Big Ones) which sold a combined 23 million copies in the United States alone, won the band three Grammy awards, and numerous Video Music Awards. When the 18-month Get a Grip Tour concluded at the end of 1994, the band wanted to take an extensive break and take their time in recording their next album (Nine Lives), this one for Columbia Records. However, Columbia records pressured Collins and the band, who wanted time off. Collins and his team created more structure for the band to achieve a quicker means by which to meet their contractual obligations to Columbia Records. This was ill received by the band. Recording for Aerosmith was historically a long and arduous process which often caused contention between the band members. The band took extensive vacations and Tyler and Perry were working with producer/songwriter Glen Ballard in the mid-1990s, writing, recording, and rehearsing songs, in sessions including ones in Miami, Florida. Some of the Columbia executives felt that since Tyler and Perry were working independently with Ballard in penning songs and that the entire band would not be working together for months at a time, that the band in whom they had a $50 million dollar investment in had the potential of breaking up. However Tyler and Perry were noted for writing songs together and then having the band record the songs during recording sessions. Additionally, drummer Joey Kramer was sidelined during pre-production due to health problems. Columbia was afraid that Collins, with whom they made the recording deal, was losing control of the band. This excessive pressure caused problems between Collins and Aerosmith. The members of Aerosmith, while grateful for all the help Collins and John Kalodner had given them in helping the band resurrect and rise back to mainstream popularity and acceptance, fired Collins in July 1996. Life After Aerosmith Tim Collins has been active in many capacities in the music, recovery, and business community. Some of his activities include: *Member of the Board of Trustees of Berklee College of Music *Board of Advisors Caron Foundation (Alcohol Recovery Treatment Center) *A member of the Board of Advisors of Musicians Assistance Program (MAP) (now called MusiCares), a part of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. *Through his namesake Collins Management, Tim is well known for his work as a \\"turn-around\\" consultant, and is in high-demand by artists, corporations, and non-profits around the globe. *A frequent lecturer and guest speaker at many colleges. *He resides in Arizona, where he is very active in the design and implementation of 12 Step Recovery Programs, mentoring of students, environmental activities, dog training (for disabilities and rescue), writing, and photography. In 2009, Tim Collins did an interview for the Biography Channel, which later appeared on the A&E; Network. An article in the Boston Globe mentioned that Collins' interview on Biography's Aerosmith special was a \\"real surprise\\" since it was his first interview since being fired, thirteen years prior.Joan Anderman, Bio: same old song and dance. Boston Globe, June 4, 2009. Retrieved 2016-10-01. \\"I've never done an interview like this, but time heals all wounds,\\" Collins told the Boston Herald. \\"They said Steven (Tyler) wasn't going to participate and had squelched a lot of people. I just think they're America's greatest rock band, and I wanted to set the record straight. I was only supposed to do 30 minutes, but I let them keep me on tape for 4.5 hours.\\" Collins mentioned that his participation in the rock doc prompted Aerosmith guitarists Joe Perry and Brad Whitford to talk after seeing a raw cut of Collins' footage. Collins was asked by the Herald directly if he would consider coming back to manage the band. \\"I haven't spoken to them. I really couldn't imagine it,\\" Collins said. \\"Life moves on.\\" In the summer of 2009, by total coincidence, Collins and Tyler literally bumped into each other in the lobby at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Denver, CO, where there was an exchange of deep feelings, reminiscent of days gone by. Regarding the incident, Collins said \\"It's always nice to have a situation come full circle, and to be friends (once again) with someone who was so important in your earlier life.\\" References Further reading *Walk This Way: The Autobiography of Aerosmith by Stephen Davis and Aerosmith Category:Aerosmith Category:American music managers ","title":"Tim Collins (manager)"},{"id":"10558900","text":"Lexington Christian Academy can refer to any of several schools: *Lexington Christian Academy (Kentucky) *Lexington Christian Academy (Massachusetts) ","title":"Lexington Christian Academy"},{"id":"10558913","text":"158 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps, is a reserve regiment of the British Army's Royal Logistic Corps.

The film formed part of the first commercial presentation of the Lumi√®re Cin√©matographe on 28 December 1895 at the Salon Indien, Grand Caf√©, 14 Boulevard des Capuchins, Paris. Production As with all early Lumi√®re movies, this film was made in a 35 mm format with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1. It was filmed by means of the Cin√©matographe, an all-in-one camera, which also serves as a film projector and developer. Plot Four men stand holding what appears to be a blanket, while one wearing a hat stands watching. A sixth man then runs towards them and attempts to jump into the blanket. He attempts this unsuccessfully twice in a row failing to jump high enough. On the third attempt he is able to jump and spin in the air, nearly clearing in the blanket. The man who are holding it then flip it a little in the air causing him to fall to the ground. His fourth attempt is more successful and he is able to roll on the blanket and land on his feet at the other side. He runs around for a fifth and final attempt but this is less successful and he gets stuck in the blanket and has difficulty getting out despite the attempts by the four men to throw him free.

Life Moses was born in Donington near Lincoln. He was educated at Bedford School, University College School, London and Exeter College, Oxford. He was ordained as a priest of the Church of England by Bishop Samuel Wilberforce in 1870. Moses attended his first s√©ance with Lottie Fowler in 1872. Charles Williams and Daniel Dunglas Home were the next mediums he visited. Five months after his introduction to spiritualism, he claimed to have experienced levitation. The automatic scripts of Moses began to appear in his books Spirit Teachings and Spirit Identity. The scripts date from 1872 to 1883 and fill 24 notebooks. All but one have been preserved by the London Spiritualist Alliance. Moses published Psychography. A Treatise on One of the Objective Forms of Psychic or Spiritual Phenomena in 1878. In it, he coins the term \\"psychography\\" (from psycho and graphy) for the spiritualist concept of channeling messages from the dead via automatic writing (also known as \\"independent writing\\", \\"direct writing\\" or \\"spirit writing\\"). Moses was one of the first vice-presidents of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR).Janet Oppenheim. (1988). The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914. Cambridge University Press. p. 138. \\"Moses became one of the first vice-presidents and council members of the SPR\\" Other early members included Frederic W. H. Myers, Henry Sidgwick and Edmund Gurney. In 1886 and 1887 in a series of publications the SPR exposed the tricks of the medium William Eglinton. Because of this, some spiritualist members including Moses resigned from the SPR.Janet Oppenheim. (1988). The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914. Cambridge University Press. pp. 139-140. Moses endorsed the spirit photography of √âdouard Isidore Buguet, however, Buguet was exposed as a fraud.Joseph McCabe. (1920). Spiritualism: A Popular History From 1847. Dodd, Mead and Company. pp. 151-173 Moses had supported Buguet in an article for Human Nature in May 1875.John Mulholland. (1938). Beware Familiar Spirits. C. Scribner's Sons. p. 150. \\"Stainton Moses warmly endorsed Buguet in an article printed in May, 1875. In June, 1875, the French government arrested Buguet for fraud. At his trial he made a complete confession, and the police seized and produced his \\"spirit\\" doll and the collection of heads that fitted on it.\\" After Burguet was exposed later in the same year, Moses insisted that Buguet was still a genuine medium and he had been bribed to make a false confession.Frank Podmore. (1902). Modern Spiritualism: A History and Criticism. Volume 2. London: Methuen & Co. pp. 120-123.Simeon Edmunds. (1966). Spiritualism: A Critical Survey.

The first existed from 1893 until World War I, the second from 1922 until 1957. The name derives from the showman Buffalo Bill Cody, whose circus played on the grounds of the first velodrome. The first velodrome The V√©lodrome Buffalo was not far from the Porte Maillot in Paris, at Neuilly-sur- Seine. It opened in 1893. The writer Tristan Bernard was director of the track in 1895. He is supposed to have introduced the practice of ringing a bell to announce the last lap of a race. Several world records were set in this velodrome. Henri Desgrange set the first ratified hour record on 11 May 1893 covering 35.325 km. In May 1893 a rider called Cassignard set the world kilometre standing start record at 1 minute and 28 seconds. On 27 September 1893 French cycling star Charles Terront left Saint Petersburg in Russia to cycle the across Poland and Germany before arriving at the V√©lodrome Buffalo after 14 days and 7 hours. The Bol d'Or 24-hour race began at the track in 1894 and was frequently run there. The track was renovated in 1902 to accommodate 8,000 spectators. The concrete track, was reduced from 333 to 300 metres. The original velodrome was demolished during World War I and the land used for an aeroplane factory. The second velodrome Le Stade Buffalo was near Paris, at Montrouge. It opened on 24 September 1922 and was demolished in 1957. It could accommodate 30,000 spectators for football matches and 40,000 for boxing matches. It housed a concrete cycling track. It continued to occasionally host the Bol d'Or cycle race. This stadium hosted three international football matches: on 13 January 1924 France beat Belgium 2‚Äì0 in front of 27,000 spectators; on 21 February 1921 they beat Ireland 4-0 and on 7 December 1930 they drew 2‚Äì2 with Belgium. On 2 January 1938 the stadium hosted the inaugural rugby league test match between Australia and France, won 35-6 by Australia.

The company was established in 2002 by Geoff Hatton, and won a contract with the US government in 2007 to design an unmanned aerial vehicle. The GFS Projects design uses the CoandƒÉ effect, unlike the failed 1950s Avrocar project. The GFS Projects design is mechanically simpler, using negative upper surface air pressure caused by the Coanda effect. Scale prototypes capable of controlled flight have existed since 2005, constructed by both GFS Projects Ltd and amateur (enthusiast) UAV builders. GFS is an abbreviation of Geoff's Flying Saucer.  Technical background  The concept of creating a disk or polygonal aircraft has been around for many years and there are numerous patent applications but the first relying on the Coanda effect acting on the upper surface alone was first put forward in a paper by R.

It has been described as the \\"seminal case\\" on jurisdictional issues. Facts Wet sulfur was loaded onto two ships docked in British Columbia causing damage to them. An action was brought in England by the Liberian owners of the Spiliada for the damage to the ship against the sulfur exporter. The owners of the second ship, the Cambridgeshire also brought an action in England. Both ships were insured by English insurers. The plaintiffs applied for leave to serve the defendants ex juris. The trial judge granted leave. The defendant successfully appealed. The Court of Appeal held that the expenses alone and the existence of a B.C. limitation period were not enough to allow the claim to come to England. Prior to the present case, an application for a stay or dismissal of proceedings falling within the proper jurisdiction of the court could only be granted on very narrow grounds. As stated in prior jurisprudence, the court could only stay the proceedings on the grounds that the suit was \\"oppressive, vexatious or an abuse of process\\" and that \\"the stay would not cause an injustice to the plaintiff\\".Maharanee of Baroda v Wildenstein [1972] 2 All ER 689, quoting St Pierre v South American Stores (Gath & Chaves) [1935] All ER Rep 408 Judgment The appeal was allowed. Lord Goff wrote the lead judgment, with which all other Lords concurred. Lord Templeman wrote a concurring judgment which expanded on certain points, with which Lord Griffiths and Lord Mackay concurred. In his judgment, Lord Goff summarised what he felt to be the current state of the law governing forum non conveniens: #A stay will only be granted where the court is satisfied that there is some other available forum in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice. #The burden of proof rests on the claimant to persuade the court to exercise its discretion to grant a stay, but if the court is satisfied that there is another available forum which is prima facie the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, the burden will then shift to the plaintiff to show that there are special circumstances by reason of which justice requires that the trial should nevertheless take place in this country. #Where there is some other forum which is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, the burden resting on the defendant is not just to show that England is not the natural or appropriate forum for the trial, but to establish that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than the English forum. #Where there exists some other forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, the court will look first to see what factors there are which point in the direction of another forum. Such factors may include the availability of witnesses, the law governing the relevant transaction, and the places where the parties respectively reside or carry on business. #If the court concludes at that stage that there is no other available forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, it will ordinarily refuse a stay. # If however the court concludes at that stage that there is some other available forum which prima facie is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, it will ordinarily grant a stay unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless not be granted. In his concurrence, Lord Templeman noted the complexity of the case at hand, observing that, \\"In the present case, a vessel managed partly in Greece and partly in England, flying the flag of Liberia and owned by a Liberian corporation is said to have been damaged by a cargo loaded by a British Columbia shipper and carried from Vancouver to India. Both sets of insurers are English.\\" He declared: Significance Spiliada has since been adopted in numerous jurisdictions including Canada, Singapore,Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp v PT Airfast Services Indonesia [1992] 2 SLR(R) 345 (CA); ; New Zealand, and Hong Kong. The standard, however, has been rejected by Australia, where it has been held that a local court can only decline to exercise jurisdiction if it can be established that it is a clearly inappropriate forum., subsequently affirmed in This has been subject to subsequent debate.

Biography Born in Revere, In 1665 Ferdinand Charles received the imperial investiture on the Duchy of Mantua with the ceremony of Coronation at the Cathedral of St. Peter. The first act of the government of the Duke was to try to curb the abuses that occurred in the collection of court fees. At the same time, is implemented the reform of public order of the Duchy.Cronologia di Mantova Ferdinando Carlo, although he was a very intelligent man and attentive to the world of music (a great lover of music, in 1700 the composer Tomaso Albinoni he dedicated his second opera in press), however, proved more inclined to women and to do charitable works, rather than to hold two strategic potentates as they were then the duchies of Mantua and Monferrato. Ferdinand Charles first married Anna Isabella Gonzaga (d. 11 August 1703), daughter of Ferrante III Gonzaga, sovereign Duke of Guastalla. This marriage was arranged by the assistance of his aunt empress dowager Eleanor Gonzaga, and took place in 1671. Anna Isabella Gonzaga was the heir of the Duchy of Guastalla and Luzzara, and her rights transferred these areas, which had long been a source of conflict between the two Gonzaga lines, to the Mantua line of the Gonzaga dynasty. During the years of the government of the Duke Ferdinando Carlo, the duchy of Mantua had a period of development and autonomy in respect of the Empire. This aroused the suspicions of the Spain which, fearing the strengthening of the small state of Mantua, decided to suspend payment of the annual contribution of 50,000 crowns a garrison of Casale, thus provoking the wrath of the Duke of Mantua.Ferdinando Carlo Gonzaga Frustrated by the Austrians in the conquest of Guastalla, he concluded a pact with Louis XIV of France on December 8, 1678, selling Casale. In this context his minister, Count Ercole Antonio Mattioli, might have become the Man in the Iron Mask, being imprisoned in Pinerolo since April 1679 for disclosing this pact to the enemies of France. The duke denied everything, but concluded a new pact with the French in 1681, obtaining thereby a yearly pension of sixty thousand lire, a career as an army general, and a part in any future French conquests in Italy. The French occupied Casale on September 29, 1681, and the Duke of Mantua lost respect in Italy. Portrait of Ferdinando Carlo Gonzaga, attributed to Frans Geffels, c. 1671 Although the Lorraine-Elbeufs were reckoned among the princes √©trangers at the court of France, as a cadet branch (Elbeuf) of a non-reigning cadet branch (Guise) of the House of Lorraine, it was not their custom to marry crowned heads. Nevertheless, following the death of his first wife, Ferdinando sought Suzanne Henriette de Lorraine's hand in pursuit of an heir and a dynastic alliance with another reigning ducal house under French influence. She was the daughter of Charles de Lorraine, Duke d'Elbeuf by his third wife, Fran√ßoise de Montault de Navailles, daughter of Philippe de Montault, Duke de Navailles. Duke Ferdinando Carlo married Mademoiselle d'Elbeuf in Milan on 8 November 1704. To the French, her husband was known as Charles de Gonzague.Foucault (comte). Histoire de L√©opold I, duc de Lorraine et de Bar, p√®re de l'Empereur, 1856, p.430 This marriage was childless. Ferdinando Carlo again chose the French side in the War of the Spanish Succession. In 1701, when the anti-French coalition forces conquered Mantua, he fled to Casale, leaving his consort Anna Isabella Gonzaga behind as regent during his absence. He paid heavily for his choice, when the French were chased back over the Alps in 1706. after the death of Duchess of Mantua, Ferdinando Carlo Gonzaga his appointment Prime Minister Ascanio Andreasi thus constituting the 'last state board Ducale, with the task of keeping at bay the internal changes of the state Mantovano against war.i Tre consigli di Governo Already declared a traitor in 1701 by Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor, he was blamed with felony by the Diet of Regensburg, 30 June 1708, and all his possessions were confiscated. The House of Savoy obtained the remaining half of Montferrat, having already conquered the first half in the War of the Mantuan Succession in 1631. The Duchy of Mantua became Austrian and ceased its independent existence. Ferdinando Carlo died the same year in Padua.

Her visage inspired numerous literary works. In the United States, the mask is also known as La Belle Italienne.FELICECALCHI: La Belle Italienne, accessed 27 July 2012 History According to an often-repeated story, the body of the young woman was pulled out of the River Seine at the Quai du Louvre in Paris around the late 1880s.Elizabeth Bronfen, Over her Dead Body: Death, Femininity and the Aesthetic, MUP, 1992, p. 207 Since the body showed no signs of violence, suicide was suspected. A pathologist at the Paris Morgue was, according to the story, so taken by her beauty that he felt compelled to make a wax plaster cast death mask of her face. It has been questioned whether the expression of the face could belong to a drowned person. According to other accounts, the mask was taken from the daughter of a mask manufacturer in Germany.\\"l'Inconnue de la Seine\\" by Anja Zeidler The identity of the girl was never discovered. Claire Forestier estimated the age of the model at no more than 16, given the firmness of the skin. In the following years, numerous copies were produced. The copies quickly became a fashionable morbid fixture in Parisian Bohemian society. Albert Camus and others compared her enigmatic smile to that of the Mona Lisa, inviting numerous speculations as to what clues the eerily happy expression in her face could offer about her life, her death, and her place in society. The popularity of the figure is also of interest to the history of artistic media, relating to its widespread reproduction. The original cast had been photographed, and new casts were created from the film negatives. These new casts displayed details that are usually lost in bodies taken from the water, but the apparent preservation of these details in the visage of the cast seemed to only reinforce its authenticity. Critic Al Alvarez wrote in his book on suicide, The Savage God: \\"I am told that a whole generation of German girls modeled their looks on her.\\" According to Hans Hesse of the University of Sussex, Alvarez reports, \\"the Inconnue became the erotic ideal of the period, as Bardot was for the 1950s. He thinks that German actresses such as Elisabeth Bergner modeled themselves on her. She was finally displaced as a paradigm by Greta Garbo.\\"Alvarez, Al. The Savage God. A Study of Suicide. New York & London: W.W. Norton & Company, 1971. Page 156. As of 2017 a workshop called L'Atelier Lorenzi in Arcueil made plaster death masks from a 19th- century mold, which is said to be that of L'Inconnue de la Seine. Artistic portrayals = Literature =  English literature  The earliest mention can be found in Richard Le Gallienne's 1900 novella The Worshipper of the Image, in which an English poet falls in love with the mask, eventually leading to the death of his daughter and the suicide of his wife. An image of L'Inconnue has been used on the cover illustration for the family history mystery novel A Habit of Dying by D. J. Wiseman.\\"A Habit of Dying\\" by DJ Wiseman  German literature  The protagonist of Rainer Maria Rilke's only novel, Die Aufzeichnungen des Malte Laurids Brigge (1910), reflects: In 1926 Ernst Benkard published Das ewige Antlitz, a book about 126 death masks, writing about our subject that she is \\"like a delicate butterfly to us, who, carefree and exhilarated, fluttered right into the lamp of life, scorching her fine wings.\\"\\"... uns jedoch ein zarter Schmetterling, der, sorglos beschwingt, an der Leuchte des Lebens seine feinen Fl√ºgel vor der Zeit verflattert und versengt hat.\\" Reinhold Conrad Muschler's 1934 widely translated best-selling novel Die Unbekannte tells the maudlin story of the fate of the provincial orphan Madeleine Lavin, who has fallen in love with the British diplomat Lord Thomas Vernon Bentick and, after a romance, commits suicide in the Seine when Bentick returns to his fianc√©e. This novel was turned into a film of the same name in 1936. A male pathologist was said to have recorded the face of an unidentified young woman who, around the age of sixteen, according to his story, had been found drowned in the Seine River at Paris, France around the late 1880s. The man at the Paris Morgue was so taken by her beauty that he worked for hours to make a plaster cast of her face. She was considered so beautiful that the worker said: \\"Her beauty was breathtaking, and showed few signs of distress at the time of passing. So bewitching that I knew beauty as such must be preserved.\\" The cast was also known as \\"Bewitching Woman\\", a nickname that never caught on. The cast was also compared to the Mona Lisa, and other famous paintings and sculptures so much that, in the following years, copies of the mask became fashionable figures in Parisian Bohemian society. Other accounts state that the cast was taken from a young German mistress (also said to be the man's natural-born daughter) who bore the child of a mask-maker who sold the cast and then committed suicide (in the Seine River) when her baby was stillborn. Other examples appear in: * Alfred D√∂blin's essay, \\"Of Faces, Pictures, and their Truth\\" (\\"Von Gesichtern, Bildern, und ihrer Wahrheit\\"), published as an introduction to photographer August Sander's 1929 collection Face of our Time (Antlitz der Zeit). * Hertha Pauli's 1931 story \\"L'Inconnue de la Seine\\", which first appeared in the Berliner Tageblatt * √ñd√∂n von Horv√°th's play based on his friend Hertha Pauli's story, written in 1934 and titled Eine Unbekannte aus der Seine * Claire Goll's 1936 short story \\"Die Unbekannte aus der Seine\\", in which the protagonist peers into a death mask and dies from a heart attack caused by delusion and guilt as he believes he recognizes the face as his daughter's * U-Boat commander Herbert A.

Vladimir Nabokov's 1934 poem L'Inconnue de la Seine, written in Russian, was published in Poslednie Novosti in 1934. It has been argued that this poem has as much to do with the Slavic myth of rusalka as with the mask itself.D. Barton Johnson (1992), \\"L'inconnue de la Seine\\" and Nabokov's Naiads, Comparative Literature, 44, 3, p. 225-248.  American literature  L'Inconnue is referenced in William Gaddis' 1955 novel The Recognitions. My Heart for Hostage by Robert Hillyer also contains a scene where the protagonist visits a morgue to see if a L'Inconnue is that of his beloved. Caitl√≠n R. Kiernan writes about L'Inconnue as the model of Resusci Anne in her novel The Drowning Girl (2012). The story is deeply tied to the themes and images of the book. Referenced as the origin of the CPR doll by Chuck Palahniuk in \\"Exodus\\", a story in Haunted. She is also referenced in Letters from Paris by Juliet Blackwell, who gave a speculative narrative of L'Inconnue in the form of flashbacks and lending her the name Sabine.  French literature  Maurice Blanchot, who owned one of the masks, described her as \\"a young girl with closed eyes, enlivened by a smile so relaxed and at ease ... that one could have believed that she drowned in an instant of extreme happiness\\".\\"... une adolescente aux yeux clos, mais vivante par un sourire si d√©li√©, si fortun√©, ... qu'on e√ªt pu croire qu'elle s'√©tait noy√©e dans un instant d'extr√™me bonheur\\" In Louis Aragon's 1944 novel Aur√©lien, L'Inconnue played a significant role as one of the main characters attempts to rejuvenate the mask from various photographs. At the beginning of the 1960s Man Ray contributed photographs to a new edition of the work. In 2012, Didier Blonde wrote a novel called L'inconnue de la Seine, about a man in Paris who stumbles upon a copy of the mask in an antiques store, and who tries to find out more about the girl it was modelled after. The book was published by Gallimard (Blanche). = Ballet = In 1963, Bentley Stone choreographed a version of L'Inconnue to music by Francis Poulenc for the Stone-Camryn Ballet. It premiered with a cast that included Ruth Ann Koesun and John Kriza.

Kaback, M.D. is a geneticist, physician, and Professor of Pediatrics and Reproductive Medicine, and chief of the Division of Medical Genetics, at the University of California‚ÄìSan Diego. He is best known for his role in the discovery and development of an enzyme assay method of screening for Tay‚ÄìSachs disease, a rare and fatal genetic disorder. This test allowed for cost-effective screening of large populations, the first such test in medical genetics. Because no large scale genetic screening had ever been done before, Kaback became involved in public health aspects of screening, including the education of target populations and genetic counseling. Although no cure for Tay‚ÄìSachs disease has been found, antenatal genetic screening has virtually eliminated the disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population in both the United States and Israel. In 1979, Kaback served on the first National Institutes of Health (NIH) panel to recommend antenatal diagnosis in cases where a couple might be at risk for conceiving a child with a hereditary disease or congenital defect. The panel brought together physicians, scientists, consumers, and others in order to develop a consensus statement for use by health care providers. In the NIH Consensus Development Program, panel members are selected for their expertise to serve as judges of evidence, and must have no prior conflicts of interest. Panel members addressed issues concerning the relative risks and benefits of genetic screening, including the costs and risks of the screening procedures themselves. It was the first NIH panel to provide recommendations for genetic screening, and its findings have since been revised many times.

The week-long sweep of Alkhan-Kala erupted into armed clashes with Chechen separatists, and the initial raid resulted in the death of Arbi Barayev, a high-ranking Chechen insurgent commander and organized crime leader. Background The Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (Chechnya) had been de facto independent from Russia since the beginning of the First Chechen War in 1994. During this independence the secular government weakened, and Chechnya came under the increasing influence of warlords and Islamist rule. In August 1999, the War of Dagestan began when Chechen Islamists invaded the Russian state of Dagestan, but were defeated by the Russian military in a month. The War of Dagestan was used as a casus belli to trigger the Second Chechen War, when Russian federal troops entered Chechnya and ended its independence. By June 2000, the war had entered an \\"insurgency phase\\", where Russian troops would perform several day-long zachistka () operations in Chechen villages. Operation On 22 June 2001, Russian troops launched a zachistka on Alkhan- Kala, a large village south-west of Grozny, triggering an armed clash with Chechen separatists. Alkhan-Kala was the home village of Arbi Barayev, one of the most powerful separatist warlords in Chechnya and founder of the Special Purpose Islamic Regiment, an Islamist organized crime syndicate that had terrorized Chechnya during its de facto independence after the First Chechen War. Officially, Barayev was reported killed in action in the initial raid, and his body was later handed over to his family.https://www.webcitation.org/603Eg25Td?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1406317.stm Barayev's death had previously been reported by Russian media several times, only to re-emerge unscathed every time, however, after the raid the Kavkaz Center announced that \\"Special Islamic commander Arbi Barayev has become a martyr.\\" The battle between Russian forces and Chechen separatists continued for six days and resulted in the massive destruction of Alkhan-Kala, with house-to-house fighting leaving dozens of homes destroyed. According to the Russian officials, many of Barayev's accomplices were killed and some 800 villagers were taken into the custody. FEDERAL FORCES RESPOND TO REBEL ATTACKS WITH PUNITIVE \\"CLEANSING\\" OPERATIONS.

From 1849 through the 1865/1866 season, when he resigned, Eisfeld often served as conductor of the New York Philharmonic Society.Thomas (1905), p. 149 In this period it was customary for the conductor to change from season to season, sometimes with two men sharing the duties. On 18 February 1851, he began a series of quartet concerts, the first being given at Hope Chapel. Eisfeld was also the first conductor of the Brooklyn Philharmonic Society, which was founded in 1857.Thomas (1905), p. 144 He continued in this position, alternating with Theodore Thomas between 1862 and 1865, before Thomas took over. This period also saw the composition of some brief works by Eisfeld.see Library of Congress scans under his name, some reproduced at IMSLP On Eisfeld's return trip from a visit to Europe in September 1858, he was one of the few survivors of the burning of the steamship where he was lashed to a platform and so drifted on the ocean, without food, for nearly two days and nights. Eisfeld never recovered from this extraordinary prostration, returning to Germany in 1866, and remained there until his death in Wiesbaden at 66.

The company operates in over 20 countries with 36 manufacturing plants, eight research and development facilities and 28 sales offices. History Cabot Corporation was founded by Godfrey Lowell Cabot in 1882 when he applied for a patent for a \\"carbon black making apparatus\\". The company incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1960. In 1993, a team of Cabot researchers developed a process for modifying the surface of carbon, allowing chemists and researchers to prepare surface modified carbon black products with properties never before associated with carbon materials. This breakthrough led to the development of new technologies and products including aqueous inkjet colorants, for printer ink the basis of Cabot's Inkjet Colorants business unit, which was founded in 1996. In 2003, Cabot developed a commercialized process that allows continuous production of aerogels under ambient conditions, which was the start of the company‚Äôs Aerogel business. In 2009, Cabot completed construction of and began operating two additional rubber black production plants at its carbon black plant in Tianjin, China, increasing capacity to 150,000 metric tons. In July 2012, Cabot purchased Norit NV, the largest producer of activated carbon, for $1.1 billion. Cabot sold its Supermetals business, which produced tantalum, niobium and related alloys, in 2011 to Global Advanced Metals Pty Ltd. Safety, health and environmental =Safety record= The company has reduced total recordable injuries by over 25% in the last five years. However, the company experienced two fatalities in 2011. The severity of incidents has caused the company to look at all aspects of workplace safety. =Environmental record= Sam Bodman, CEO of Cabot during the coltan boom, was appointed in December 2004 to serve as President Bush‚Äôs Secretary of Energy. Under Bodman‚Äôs leadership from 1987 to 2000, according to Jason Leopold, Cabot was one of the U.S.‚Äôs largest polluters, accounting for 60,000 tons of airborne toxic emissions annually. Cabot reduced its Environmental Non-Conformance events (ENCs), from a high of over 80 incidences in 2008, to 17 in FY 2012. The company defines an environmental non-conformance event as a reportable spill or release, a Notice of Violation, a public complaint or certain permit deviations. The company invested over $35 million in FY 2011 on environmentally-related capital projects to improve efficiency and maintain regulatory compliance. The company‚Äôs goal is a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emission intensity by 2020, using 2005 as the baseline year. One example of greenhouse gas reduction is a heat recovery advancement project to convert exhaust heat to steam at the company‚Äôs fumed metal oxides plant in Rheinfelden, Germany. The steam produced is used in the plant if needed or sold to a neighboring company. The project has the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 1,400 MTs each year. =Responsible care= In 2010 Cabot joined the American Chemistry Council, and as such is obliged to implement the Council‚Äôs Responsible Care program as part of a global initiative. Cabot is implementing RC 14001, which incorporates the requirements of both the ACC Responsible Care and the ISO 14001 Management Systems, for all its manufacturing facilities, beginning with those in North America. =Sustainability= Cabot‚Äôs 2010/2011 sustainability report, titled \\"Sustainability Matters: Cabot Corporation‚Äôs 2010/2011 Sustainability Report,\\" met all the informational requirements to receive an Application Level C certification from the Global Reporting Initiatives. Cabot‚Äôs adherence to GRI reporting standards affirms its commitment to more transparent and thorough reporting. Awards In 2012, Cabot Corporation was selected as a Bronze Winner for the Ninth Annual Team Massachusetts Economic Impact Awards. They were also selected as one of CR Magazine‚Äôs 100 Best Corporate Citizens for 2012. The American Chemistry Council honored Cabot with the Responsible Care Performance Award in April 2012 for helping the ACC meet industry-wide safety and product stewardship targets. In April 2012, Cabot ranked forty-fourth among the top 100 leading companies that demonstrated superior management, mitigation and adaptation in the field of climate innovation. Cabot was awarded a 2012 Leadership Award for the Massachusetts Excellence in Commuter Options Awards. Board of directors Cabot Corporation‚Äôs Board of Directors is chaired by non-executive John F. O'Brien, retired President and Chief Executive Officer Allmerica Financial Corp.

As of August 1, 2018, the station is silent.F.C.C.'s list of silent A.M. stations as of March 7, 2019; retrieved March 14, 2019. History of WBIG In 1925, Jefferson Standard Life Insurance bought WNRC (Wayne Nelson Radio Company) and changed the call letters to WBIG (\\"We Believe In Greensboro Where Business Is Good.\\"). Among the programs that aired on the station: Arthur Godfrey, Jack Benny, and murder mysteries. In its early days, the station was located in the basement of the O. Henry Hotel. Bluegrass musician Bill Monroe, a resident of the area, was one of the country music performers who played live in the studio. According to former WKEW owner Bill Mitchell, Manoree, the tonic that sponsored Monroe's show, \\"helped get you going.\\" WBIG also had its own 10-piece orchestra. In 1934, Jefferson Standard sued to collect $790 in overdue rent from WBIG, which had its facilities at the top of the Jefferson Standard Building, claiming the station was attempting to get out of paying by having Guilford Broadcasting take over the license. In 1980, WBIG was the number one station in Guilford County. For more than 20 years, Bob Poole, the \\"Duke of Stoneville,\\" was a DJ. \\"The smooth, deep-voiced morning man for the old BIG ... would whistle with his theme song each day and ... went down nice and easy, like a first cup of coffee.\\" Dusty Dunn was a long-time morning host, his sidekick was Buddy Bray, and Jim Pritchett was sports director. Lloyd Gordon, the news and programming director, said that Jefferson-Pilot signed off WBIG on November 20, 1986, because the station was not making money.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqjLzfIi83k Dunn and Ken Karns were among those still working there at the time. History of WWBG On December 9, 1994, Walt Cockerham announced that the former WBIG would return to the air with its old frequency, but the call sign was no longer available. (A station in Aurora, Illinois would adopt the WBIG callsign in 1991.) During the year after WKEW changed from news/talk, Truth Broadcasting bought several stations in the Greensboro area, including the one that would be called WWBG, the call sign that the new station was assigned by the Federal Communications Commission on August 21, 1992. Truth Broadcasting planned to do what WKEW had done. This meant news, talk, sports and community affairs relating to Greensboro. On November 1, 1999, Dunn and Bray returned to 1470 AM. Dunn said, \\"It's like being home. We've got the old morning crew back together.\\" The news/talk format only lasted until January 1, 2002, because, program director David Albright said, it was not profitable and a number of Spanish-speaking people wanted a radio station of their own. \\"La Movidita\\" was already airing on WTOB in Winston-Salem. In 2003, Truth Broadcasting stopped selling time to La Movidita, which moved to its former home WSGH. Que Pasa moved from WSGH to WWBG and WTOB. WTOB began airing separate programming in 2013.

The term natural substances refers to those substances found in nature that have not had man- made changes made in their molecular structure. They are used as medicine for human being and animal, internally and externally for curing disease, e.g., Senna and Cinchona. A crude drug is any naturally occurring, unrefined substance derived from organic or inorganic sources such as plant, animal, bacteria, organs or whole organisms intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in humans or other animals.  Morphology or Organoleptic Characters of Crude Drugs  Identification of the crude drug by organoleptic characters is one of the important aspects of pharmacognostical study. Morphological study follows a special terminology which must be known to a pharmacognostist. The morphological terminology is derived from botany and zoology, depending upon the source of the crude drug. In general, color, odor, taste, size, shape, and special features, like touch, texture, fracture, presence of trichomes, and presence of ridges of crude drugs are studied under morphology. Aromatic odor of umbelliferous fruits and sweet taste of liquorice are the example of this type of evaluation. The study of form of a crude drug is morphology, while description of the form is morphography. However, shape and size of crude drugs as described in official books should only be considered as guidelines and may vary depending upon several factors. For example, color of the crude drug may fade if it gets exposed to sunlight for very long duration or if, the drug is not stored properly. Depending upon the condition under which the drug is growing or cultivated, i.e., availability of proper irrigation, fertilizers or even high temperature, may influence the size may be available and the crude drugs if grown in adverse conditions may be of small size. Color of the flowers as in case Catharanthus roseus and Catharanthus alba, presence of thorns in case of Asparagus recemosus and absence in Asparagus officinalis, arrangement of flowers in case of Withania semnifera or Witharia coagulens can help in differentiating the varieties of the same plant. Arrangement of cracks and wrinkles in case of stem bark of varieties of Cinchona bark, or the color of ALOE can separate in varieties. The adulteration of seed of Strychnos nux- vomica with the seed of Strrychnos nux-blanda or Strychnos potatorum, caraway with Indian dill, Alexandrian senna with dog senna or palthe senna are identified by morphological means. In case of a cellular products (Unorganized Drugs), form of the drug depends totally on the method of preparation of the drug. Thus, gum acacia is found in the form of ovoid tears, while tragacanth is marketed as vermiform ribbon with longitudinal striations.  Overview  Eli Lilly crude drug case for pharmacy students to study: contains 216 different specimens Crude drugs are unrefined medications in their raw or natural forms. Prior to the 1950s, every pharmacy student learned about crude drugs in pharmacognosy class. Pharmacognosy is the study of the proper horticulture, harvesting and uses of the raw medications found in nature. Raising, harvesting and selling crude drugs was how many large pharmaceutical companies started out. Companies such as Eli Lilly and Company sold crude drugs to pharmacists to save them time and money, but the early pharmacy graduate would know how to raise their own crude drugs if need be.  Evaluation  To evaluate means to identify it and to determine its quality and purity, the identity of a drug can be established by actual collection of the drug from a plant or animal that has been positively identified. The evaluation of drug involves a number of methods that may be classified as follows: # Organoleptic and morphological evaluation: Evaluation by means of organs of senses knowing the color, odor, taste, size, shape and special features like texture. # Microscopic: For identification of the pure powdered drug. This method allows more detailed examination of a drug and their identification by their known histological characters. Microscope by the virtue of its property to magnify, permits minute sections under study to enlarge so that leaf constants, stomatal index, palisade ratio can be determined. # Biologic: Pharmacological activities of drugs are evaluated by bioassays. When the estimation of potency of crude drug or its preparations are done by means of measuring its effect on living organisms like bacteria, fungal growth, or animal tissue, it is known as biological effect of the drug, compared to the standard drug. By these methods, a crude drug can be assessed and further clinical trial can be recommended. # Chemical: Chemical assays are best to determine potency and active constituents. It comprises different test and assays. The isolation, purification and identification of active constituents are the methods of evaluation. Quantitative chemical test such as acid value, saponificaion value etc are also covered under these techniques. # Physical: Physical constants are applied to active principles. These are helpful in evaluation with reference to moisture content, specific gravity, density, optic rotation etc.  History  Creighton University College of Pharmacy crude drugs circa 1910 The usage of crude drugs dates to prehistoric times. Traditional medicine often incorporates the gathering and preparation of material from natural sources, particularly herbs. In such practice, the active ingredients and method of action are largely unknown to the practitioner. In recent history, the development of modern chemistry and application of the scientific method shaped the use of crude drugs. Eventually, the use of crude drugs reach a zenith in the early 1900s and eventually gave way to the use of purified active ingredients from the natural source. Currently the use and exploration of crude drugs has again gained prominence in the medical community. The realization that many completely unknown substances are yet to be discovered from crude drugs has created a new interest in pharmacognosy and has led to many medical breakthroughs. In 1907, the Pure Food and Drug Act was implemented and standardization of crude drugs took place. Often the USP would specify what percentage of active ingredient was needed to claim a crude drug met USP standards. An example of standardization would be as follows (from the United States Pharmacopeia):2007 USP > Opium is the air-dried milky exudate obtained by incising the unripe > capsules of Papaver somniferum Linne or its variety album De Candolle (Fam. > Papaveraceae). Opium in its normal air-dried condition yields not less than > 9.5 percent of anhydrous morphine.

It is a definitive procedure that produces a test result. In order to ensure accurate and relevant test results, a test method should be \\"explicit, unambiguous, and experimentally feasible.\\", as well as effective and reproducible. A test can be considered an observation or experiment that determines one or more characteristics of a given sample, product, process, or service. The purpose of testing involves a prior determination of expected observation and a comparison of that expectation to what one actually observes. The results of testing can be qualitative (yes/no), quantitative (a measured value), or categorical and can be derived from personal observation or the output of a precision measuring instrument. Usually the test result is the dependent variable, the measured response based on the particular conditions of the test or the level of the independent variable. Some tests, however, may involve changing the independent variable to determine the level at which a certain response occurs: in this case, the test result is the independent variable. Importance In software development, engineering, science, manufacturing, and business, its developers, researchers, manufacturers, and related personnel must understand and agree upon methods of obtaining data and making measurements. It is common for a physical property to be strongly affected by the precise method of testing or measuring that property. As such, fully documenting experiments and measurements while providing needed documentation and descriptions of specifications, contracts, and test methods is vital. Using a standardized test method, perhaps published by a respected standards organization, is a good place to start. Sometimes it is more useful to modify an existing test method or to develop a new one, though such home-grown test methods should be validated and, in certain cases, demonstrate technical equivalency to primary, standardized methods. Again, documentation and full disclosure are necessary. A well-written test method is important. However, even more important is choosing a method of measuring the correct property or characteristic. Not all tests and measurements are equally useful: usually a test result is used to predict or imply suitability for a certain purpose. For example, if a manufactured item has several components, test methods may have several levels of connections: * test results of a raw material should connect with tests of a component made from that material * test results of a component should connect with performance testing of a complete item * results of laboratory performance testing should connect with field performance These connections or correlations may be based on published literature, engineering studies, or formal programs such as quality function deployment. Validation of the suitability of the test method is often required. Content Quality management systems usually require full documentation of the procedures used in a test. The document for a test method might include: * descriptive title * scope over which class(es) of items, policies, etc. may be evaluated * date of last effective revision and revision designation * reference to most recent test method validation * person, office, or agency responsible for questions on the test method, updates, and deviations * significance or importance of the test method and its intended use * terminology and definitions to clarify the meanings of the test method * types of apparatus and measuring instrument (sometimes the specific device) required to conduct the test * sampling procedures (how samples are to be obtained and prepared, as well as the sample size) * safety precautions * required calibrations and metrology systems * natural environment concerns and considerations * testing environment concerns and considerations * detailed procedures for conducting the test * calculation and analysis of data * interpretation of data and test method output * report format, content, data, etc.  Validation  Test methods are often scrutinized for their validity, applicability, and accuracy. It is very important that the scope of the test method be clearly defined, and any aspect included in the scope is shown to be accurate and repeatable through validation. Test method validations often encompass the following considerations: * accuracy and precision; demonstration of accuracy may require the creation of a reference value if none is yet available * repeatability and reproducibility, sometimes in the form of a Gauge R&R.; * range, or a continuum scale over which the test method would be considered accurate (e.g., 10 N to 100 N force test) * measurement resolution, be it spatial, temporal, or otherwise * curve fitting, typically for linearity, which justifies interpolation between calibrated reference points * robustness, or the insensitivity to potentially subtle variables in the test environment or setup which may be difficult to control * usefulness to predict end-use characteristics and performance * measurement uncertainty * interlaboratory or round robin tests * other types of measurement systems analysis  See also  *Certified reference materials *Data analysis *Design of experiments *Document management system *EPA Methods *Integrated test facility *Measurement systems analysis *Measurement uncertainty *Metrication *Observational error *Replication (statistics) *Sampling (statistics) *Specification (technical standard) *Test management approach *Verification and validation References =General references, Books= * Pyzdek, T, \\"Quality Engineering Handbook\\", 2003, * Godfrey, A.

Born Herbert Mulkey, he hyphenated his name after having it made fun of in school. Mul-Key attended Harper High School in Atlanta, where he was an all-city player. However, his attitude was criticized by coaches, and he did not receive a college scholarship. Yet, he was able to play at Alabama State College but for only one season. After that he worked a series of jobs and served in the Navy. Childhood friend Harold McLinton told Mul-Key of an open try-out for the Redskins. Mul-Key borrowed money from his parents and friends to travel to Washington, D.C. to attend the tryout held by George Allen and the Redskins in 1971. Allen was impressed by his speed, running 40 yards in under 4.5 seconds on a wet field, and signed him to the rookie minimum salary of $12,000. He was the only player ever signed from these tryouts, which were more public relations stunts than an actual talent search. Mul-Key got his only start in 1972, rushing for almost 100 yards against the Dallas Cowboys. For most of the time on the team, he served as a kick returner. In pre-season in 1973 Mul-Key ran the first kickoff at Rich Stadium back 102 yards for a touchdown. He went to the Pro Bowl after the 1973 season as a kick returner. Mul-Key injured his shoulder in his first season and had surgery in the off-season after the 1974 season. He was cut before the 1975 season.

Biography In 1827, he began studies with Adolph Zimmerman in Zittau, and later he studied with organist-composer Adolph Hesse in Breslau. By 1842, he was conducting and playing the cello in Breslau. Eventually, Bergmann conducted orchestras in Vienna, Breslau, Budapest, Warsaw, and Venice. Motivated by his implication in the revolutions of 1848 in Vienna,Wittke (1952), p. 295. Bergmann came to the United States in 1850 as first cellist in the Germania Orchestra, a touring band of young German musicians, mostly refugees. When the conductor of that orchestra resigned the same year, Bergmann took over.Upton (1908), p. 52 The Germania Orchestra subsequently based itself in Boston before disbanding in 1854 after giving 800 concerts over its career. During this period Bergmann directed the Germanians in performances with the Handel and Haydn Society of that city, including the Boston premiere of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.H. Earle Johnson, Hallelujah, amen!: The Story of the Handel and Haydn Society of Boston (Boston: Bruce Humphries, 1965), 75 After this Bergmann went to Chicago and was immediately invited to direct the Chicago Philharmonic Society. However, he left after giving only two concerts because the Chicago musicians intrigued against him.Upton (1908), p. 259 In 1854, he went to New York City to conduct the M√§nnergesangverein Arion, a choral group of German-born men. When Theodore Eisfeld, conductor of the New York Philharmonic Society, became sick for the last concert of the 1854‚Äì1855 season, Bergmann replaced him, directing Wagner's Tannh√§user overture. This concert was so successful that Bergmann became sole conductor for the 1855‚Äì1856 season.Thomas (1905), p. 36 In 1859 he conducted the American premiere of Tannh√§user at the Stadt Theater. It was the first performance of a Wagner opera in America. He also played cello in a renowned piano quintet that included Theodore Thomas on first violin and William Mason on piano. In addition to the Philharmonic, he also conducted a choral group, the New York Harmonic Society which later became the Mendelssohn Union. Bergmann organized and conducted a German music festival, held in the Winter Garden Theatre, in 1855, and in 1856 introduced German opera at Niblo's Garden. He conducted Italian as well as German opera in New York. Eisfeld returned to conduct the Philharmonic Society for the 1856‚Äì1857 and 1857‚Äì1858 seasons, but Bergmann returned to the podium the next season, and shared the podium with Eisfeld between 1859 and 1865. In 1865 Eisfeld returned to Europe, and Bergmann continued as sole conductor of the Philharmonic Society until his death in 1876. Bergmann's life and career declined after 1870. Bergmann suffered from alcoholism. Since 1864, there had been a rival orchestra conducted by Theodore Thomas to contend with. And the panic of 1873 exacerbated the Philharmonic's financial problems. In 1876, the Philharmonic board requested his resignation, and his wife, whose name has been lost to history, died. In his autobiography, Theodore Thomas described Bergmann as \\"a talented musician and a fair 'cello player\\"Thomas (1905), p. 35 but went on to criticize him as follows: George Upton wrote:Upton (1908), p. 55 Conductors of the New York Philharmonic Society, 1855‚Äì1876 * 1855‚Äì1856 Bergmann * 1856‚Äì1858 Theodore Eisfeld * 1858‚Äì1859 Bergmann * 1859‚Äì1865 Bergmann and Eisfeld * 1865‚Äì1876 BergmannThomas (1905), p. 149 References Bibliography  Category:1821 births Category:1876 deaths Category:People from D√∂beln Category:People from the Kingdom of Saxony Category:American conductors (music) Category:American male conductors (music) Category:German-American Forty-Eighters Category:Music directors of the New York Philharmonic Category:19th-century conductors (music) Category:19th- century American musicians Category:19th-century male musicians ","title":"Carl Bergmann (musician)"},{"id":"10559853","text":"Tuba-Zangariyye or Tuba az-Zanghariyya (, ) is a Bedouin town in the Northern District of Israel.

October 05, 2011 During a visit to the mosque, the Chief Sephardic Rabbi of Israel, Shlomo Amar, and Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi Yona Metzger, jointly condemned the act and conveyed a message of reconciliation to the village residents. Amar said that he saw it as his duty to set a personal example for the respect one must show to places holy to different religions. He stresses that in lieu of proof, the act may have not been committed by Jews, and the attempt to ascribe the act to price tag activists may be in fact a blood libel. He also added that if the arsonist was in fact Jewish ‚Äì he was subject to some of the Jewish laws of Dinei Rodef.Kobi Nahshoni, 'Rabbi Amar: Mosque arson may be blood libel,' in Ynet, 4 October 2011: 'the attempt to ascribe the act to \\"price tag\\" activists is basically a \\"blood libel\\".

The circumstances of the attack were questioned by some media sources, who suggested the possibility of an inside job. The graffiti that defaced the walls was written with coal and not paint. It was written on a part of the wall that was not obscured by soot, but rather below the soot-covered section. The mosque was located near village homes, and several others were closer to the main highway, several miles away. A Bedouin resident of the village went on television to say he thought the attack on the local mosque was perpetrated by Arabs local residents rather than Jews. According to Bassem Souad, \\"A Jew will not come and burn down this mosque. The one who burned the mosque is one of our own. I say this because I am not afraid of anyone. He is from the village, to my great regret.\\"Mosque arson blamed on locals In response several shots were fired at his home.

Originally concerned with the practice of Freemasonry in London and Westminster, it soon became known as the Grand Lodge of England. Because it was the first Masonic Grand Lodge to be created, convention calls it the Premier Grand Lodge of England in order to distinguish it from the Most Ancient and Honourable Society of Free and Accepted Masons according to the Old Constitutions, more usually referred to as the Ancient Grand Lodge of England, and the Grand Lodge of All England Meeting at York. It existed until 1813, when it united with the Ancient Grand Lodge of England to create the United Grand Lodge of England.Douglas Knoop, The Genesis of Freemasonry, Manchester University Press, 1947 The basic principles of the Grand Lodge of England were inspired by the ideal of tolerance and universal understanding of the Enlightenment and by the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century. Foundation Table of lodges affiliated to the Grand Lodge, 1735. The Grand Lodge was founded shortly after George I, the first Hanoverian king of the Kingdom of Great Britain, ascended to the throne on 1 August 1714 and the end of the first Jacobite rising of 1715.The foundation of the first Grand Lodge in context Officially, the Grand Lodge of England was founded in London on St. John the Baptist's day, 24 June 1717, when four existing Lodges gathered at the Goose and Gridiron Ale-house in St. Paul's Church-yard in London and constituted themselves a Grand Lodge. The four lodges had previously met together in 1716 at the Apple-Tree Tavern, \\"and having put into the Chair the oldest Master Mason (now the Master of a Lodge), they constituted themselves a Grand Lodge pro Tempore in due form.\\" It was at that meeting in 1716 that they resolved to hold the Annual Assembly and Feast and then choose a Grand Master from among themselves, which they did the following year. All four lodges were simply named after the public houses where they were accustomed to meet, at the Goose and Gridiron Ale-house in St. Paul's Church-yard (Lodge now called Lodge of Antiquity No. 2); the Crown Ale- house in Parker's Lane off Drury Lane; the Apple-Tree Tavern in Charles Street, Covent Garden (Lodge now called Lodge of Fortitude and Old Cumberland No. 12); and the Rummer and Grapes Tavern in Channel Row, Westminster (Lodge now called Royal Somerset House and Inverness Lodge No. IV). While the three London lodges were mainly operative lodges, the Rummer and Grapes, by the Palace of Westminster, appears to have been primarily a lodge of accepted and speculative gentlemen masons.Jones, Bernard E.; Freemasons' Guide and Compendium, pg. 171; 1950, 1982, Publ. by Harrap Ltd., London. Coil, Henry Wilson; \\"England, Grand Lodge of\\", pg. 232. Coil's Masonic Encyclopedia, 1961, 1996, Macoy Publ. Co., Richmond Virginia; Little is known of Anthony Sayer, the first Grand Master, but the next, George Payne, rose to a high position within the Commissioners of Taxes. Payne served as Grand Master twice, in 1718‚Äì19, and 1720‚Äì21. The year in between was taken by John Theophilus Desaguliers, a scientist, clergyman, and a pupil of Newton. Thereafter, every Grand Master was a member of the nobility, although in these early years, it is unlikely that they were anything more than figureheads. The intention was to raise the public profile of the society, which evidently succeeded. In 1725, aside from London Lodges, the minutes of Grand Lodge show lodges at Bath, Bristol, Norwich, Chichester, Chester, Reading, Gosport, Carmarthen, Salford, and Warwick, and embryonic Provincial Grand Lodges in Cheshire and South Wales. Grand Lodge was outgrowing London. The Book of Constitutions George Payne took it upon himself to write the General Regulations of a Free Mason, which were recited at his second installation as Grand Master in 1720. Very little is known of the period from 1717 to 1721, due to lack of minutes and written material, but sometime during this period the Revd. Dr. James Anderson was either commissioned or took it upon himself to write The Constitutions of the Free-Masons containing the History, Charges, Regulations, & of that most Ancient and Right Worshipful Fraternity: For use of the Lodges. According to Anderson, he was commissioned to digest the old Gothic Constitutions of Freemasonry. The book was submitted for approval to Grand Lodge, and published by order of the Grand Master in 1723, with the addition of the outgoing Grand Masters method of constituting a new Masonic Lodge. It started with Desagulier's dedication to the previous Grand Master, John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu. There followed a long \\"Historical\\" introduction, tracing Freemasonry back to biblical times, a set of six \\"Charges\\" (masonic obligations), an expanded version of Payne's Regulations, Grand Master Wharton's method of constituting a new lodge, and finally a section of songs. For the first time, all of Freemasonry, except for the ritual, was available in a printed book. Anderson received no remuneration from the pocket editions which started to appear in the 1730s, which may have inspired the revised edition of 1738.Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon Lionel Vibert, Anderson's Constitutions of 1723, The Builder, August 1923Anderson's Constitutions Franklin's reprint, retrieved 13 November 2012 Expansion and conflict Hogarth's Night The drunk receiving the contents of a bucket is wearing a masonic master's jewel, and his servant's sword indicates a tyler. The man with the mop may be an allusion to the Tyler erasing chalk marks from the lodge floor. The Rummer and Grapes on the inn sign depict one of the four lodges which founded Grand Lodge The new Grand Lodge was evidently not immediately attractive to the older \\"St. John's\\" or independent lodges, who already found much to dislike about the organisation. It had been their custom to mark the lodge out in chalk, which would be erased with a mop and bucket. This began to be replaced with tape and thin metal letters, hence an advertisement in a London newspaper in 1726 for a lecture on \\"Ante-Diluvian Masonry. Showing what innovations have lately been introduced by the Doctor and some other of the Moderns, with their Tape, Jacks, and Movable Letters, Blazing Stars, etc., to the great indignity of the Mop and Pail.\\"F. De P. Castells, The Origin of the Masonic Degrees, (reprinted) Kessinger Publishing, 2003, pp. 39‚Äì40 The second quarter of the 18th century saw the London organisation flourish as the Grand Lodge of England. However, the rapidity of growth saw some lodges fail in their first year. A crop of disaffected ex-masons brought a few published exposures, the most successful being Pritchard's \\"Masonry Dissected\\", in 1730. As this contained a recognisable representation of all three degrees, with the secrets that would supposedly ensure admission to a Masonic Lodge, Grand Lodge made a few changes to their ritual and password which took them out of step with the new Grand Lodges in Ireland and Scotland. This also widened the gulf between a relatively new Grand Lodge, and many unaffiliated lodges in the country, who viewed with extreme suspicion any departure from the \\"Ancient Landmarks\\".Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon The Formation of the Grand Lodge of the Antients, I. R. Clarke, Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, vol 79 (1966), p. 270-73, retrieved 28 June 2012 When, in 1721, the Grand Lodge secured John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu as their first noble Grand Master, a foot parade was staged at his installation. This became an annual event, with later processions being conducted in carriages. As every notable admission into the fraternity was heralded in print, an aura of elitism attracted scorn, and the annual processions attracted ridicule and finally, physical parody. In the 1740s, being followed down the road by the \\"Scald Miserable Masons\\" became too much, and Masonic Processions were banned by Grand Lodge in 1747. Ancients and Moderns In 1751, a group of unaffiliated lodges of mainly Irish membership formed the Grand Committee of what would become the Most Ancient and Honourable Society of Free and Accepted Masons according to the Old Constitutions, now known as the Ancients. This society, which adhered to what it believed to be an older and more authentic ritual than the original Grand Lodge, grew rapidly under the influence of Laurence Dermott, who was Grand Secretary from 1752 to 1771, and deputy Grand Master intermittently thereafter. (As the Grand Masters of the period were mainly noble figureheads, it was the Deputy Grand Master who actually directed the Grand Lodge.) It also benefited from early recognition by the Grand Lodges of Ireland and Scotland. Dermott wrote a new Book of Constitutions for his Grand Lodge, entitled Ahiman Rezon. Published in 1756, the first edition expressed a wish for reconciliation with the other Grand Lodge. The second edition, in 1764, turned on their \\"unconstitutional fopperies\\". The Premier Grand Lodge were already referred to as the \\"Moderns\\", and Dermott made sure that the epithet stuck, his own Grand Lodge becoming known to history as the Ancients. Succeeding editions heaped ever more scorn on the Premier Grand Lodge. Dermott's prose was bitingly sarcastic, and witty. Ahiman Rezon sold well.Association of Atholl Lodges Ahiman Rezon, Ray Sheppard, retrieved 8 July 2012Internet Archive Ahiman Rezon (pdf) retrieved 30 June 2012 Also in 1764, a lodge of Edinburgh masons, who had only joined the previous year, seceded to the Moderns. These were instrumental in the formation of the first Grand Chapter of Royal Arch masonry. Among their members was William Preston, who within a decade, had become a valued writer and lecturer on Masonry. The success in the 1770s of Preston's lectures, and his book, entitled \\"Illustrations of Masonry\\", led to his appointment as assistant Grand Secretary, and his election as Master of the Lodge of Antiquity, formerly the Goose and Gridiron, and reputedly the oldest lodge in the constitution.Phoenix Masonry Gordon P. G. Hills, Brother William Preston, an Illustration of the Man, his Methods and his Work. Prestonian Lecture, 1927 Preston's position as Assistant Grand Secretary enabled him to correspond with the Grand Lodge of Scotland, casting doubt on the regularity of the Ancients, and attempting to sever the ties between the Ancients and the Scots. This was a predictable failure, and further poisoned the relationship between the two London Grand Lodges. The huge influx of new masons at Preston's Antiquity led to discontent among the longer serving lodge members, and he also managed to fall out with Grand Secretary Heseltine. When he and a few others walked to lodge from church in their regalia one Sunday, his enemies made the incident into an unauthorised procession. Preston unrepentantly cited Antiquity's precedence as a founding \\"time immemorial\\" lodge, and was expelled, taking half of Antiquity with him. They allied themselves with the Grand Lodge of All England at York, and for ten years, from 1779 to 1789, became the Grand Lodge of All England South of the River Trent.Witham Matthew Bywater, Notes on Laurence Dermott G.S. and his Work, London, 1884 Whilst the new Grand Chapter had been set up with the Grand Master, Lord Blayney, at its head, Grand Secretary Heseltine continued to write to Provincial Lodges assuring them that Royal Arch masonry had no part in regular masonry, although he was himself one of the founders of Grand Chapter.Phoenix Masonry Bernard E.Jones, Freemason's Book of the Royal Arch, revised Carr, 1966, retrieved 23 September 2012 Thomas Dunckerley, the Grand Superintendent of the new Grand Chapter, had considerable success in spreading Royal Arch, Mark, and Templar masonry in the Southern provinces of the Moderns, and assisted Heseltine and Preston in starting to move Freemasonry out of inns and into dedicated masonic buildings. The official attitude towards the Royal Arch remained antagonistic, which proved difficult as the two Grand Lodges moved towards union in the next century.Thomas Dunckerley, his life, labours, and letters by Henry Sadler, London, 1891Pietre-Stones The Fourth Degree in the Craft, Yasha Beringer, retrieved 19 July 2012 Union with the Ancients Relations between the two major bodies in English Freemasonry experienced a thaw in the 1790s. It is hard not to correlate this with the death of Dermott in 1791, and the progressive editing out of his vitriol from Ahiman Rezon, but other factors contributed. John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl became Grand Master of the Ancients, and Francis Rawdon- Hastings, Earl of Moira became Acting Grand Master of the Moderns (the Grand Master being the Prince of Wales). Neither of these noblemen was content to be a mere figurehead, and in 1799 they were forced to act together, in company with representatives of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, to keep Freemasonry from being outlawed. Fear of Napoleon's spies prompted the Unlawful Societies Act, prohibiting any association bound by secret oaths, and the united representations of the three Grand Lodges induced the Government to make a specific exception of the lodges of Freemasons.Pietre Stones The Unlawful Societies Act of 1799, Dr Andrew Prescott, from M.

Scanlan, ed., The Social Impact of Freemasonry on the Modern Western World The Canonbury Papers I (London: Canonbury Masonic Research Centre, 2002), pp. 116‚Äì134, retrieved 13 July 2012 Progress towards union remained slow, until the Moderns formed the \\"Lodge of Promulgation\\" in 1809, for the purpose of reverting their ritual to a point where it was in step with the Ancients, the Scots and the Irish.Pietre-Stones Lodges of Instruction, Yasha Beresiner, retrieved 17 July 2012 One of their resolutions was that the ceremony of installation (of a new master of a lodge) was part of \\"Antient\\" masonry. They then obliged their own uninstalled masters and the masters of the London lodges to undergo the ritual in three meetings during December 1810 and January 1811.Phoenix Masonry R. F. Gould, History of Freemasonry, vol II, (rev Wright 1936), p. 229 That year, the Moderns formally told the Ancients that they had resolved to return to the older ritual, and the process of union began. At the end of 1812, the Earl of Moira resigned to take up the post of Governor of India, and the Duke of Sussex became Grand Master on the resignation of his brother, the Prince Regent. On 1 December 1813, the Duke of Atholl resigned the leadership of the Ancients. The Duke of Kent, the older brother of Sussex and the father of Queen Victoria took over. He had already united the Ancients and Moderns in Canada. He simply merged the lodges of the Moderns with the nearest lodge of the Ancients. In other words, he abolished the Canadian Moderns.Encyclopedia of Freemasonry retrieved 17 July 2012 So it was that on the Feast of St. John the Evangelist, 27 December 1813, the two English Grand Lodges came together to form the United Grand Lodge of England, with the Duke of Sussex as Grand Master.

Ortmann is a three-time world champion, winning the 1995 WPA World Nine-ball Championship and both the 2007 and 2010 Straight pool world championships. Ortmann is the second player (after Earl Strickland) to win three world championships. With fourteen wins, he is one of the most successful players at the European Pool Championships. Ortmann is the second to Ralf Souquet on the Euro Tour, winning fourteen events. Ortmann was the first player from Europe to win the U.S. Open Straight Pool Championship, in 1989. He has represented Europe eight times in the annual Mosconi Cup competition between 1994 and 2004, and was on the winning side in 1995 and 2002. With 44 German national medals, Ortmann is one of the most successful German pool players of all time. In 1996, he was the first cue sports player to receive the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, the highest sporting award given in Germany. Ortmann was inducted into the Straight Pool Hall of Fame in an August 2013 ceremony in New York City. The following year, he was inducted into the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame. Career =Early career= Ortmann was born and raised in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. At age six he began playing on a pool table in the basement of his parents' restaurant. Ortmann won his first championship in 1985 at age 17 (the 8-Ball Junior European championships), defeating Sweden's Per Anda in the final. The following year he won his first German national championship (the straight pool championship), after meeting Thomas Engert in the final. Ortmann studied in Munich to become an electronics technician, and at age 20 he became the manager of a billiard centre with 80 pool and billiard tables. He was the first player from Europe to win the U.S. Open Straight Pool Championship in 1989. He won the event despite it being his first trip outside the Continent. As a relative unknown, Ortmann defeated Steve Mizerak in the final. Ortmann also won his first of many adult European Pool Championship events that year, beating Waldemar Markert in the straight-pool final. =Professional career (1993‚Äì2010)= He entered his first Euro Tour event in 1993, finishing second at that year's German Open and winning the following events in Austria and Hungary. Ortmann won his second US championship later that year, again in straight pool. He won five Euro Tour events the following year (four in a row), and finished second twice. During the nine-event season, Ortmann reached the finals seven times. He won his first world championship (the 1995 WPA World Nine-ball Championship), playing the American Dallas West in the final. In 1996, Ortmann was the first cue-sports player to receive the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt; fellow pool player Ralf Souquet won the award the following year. Ortmann won the winner-take-all International Challenge of Champions event in 1997. He was runner-up two years later, losing the final to Francisco Bustamante. In 2000, however, Ortmann defeated Bustamante in the final for his second championship. Ortmann formed Ortmann Billiards, a pool-product manufacturer and retailer, in 2004. Although the company specializes in cue sports such as pool, snooker and carrom, it also supports air hockey, darts and poker. Ortmann reached the final of the 2004 World Pool Masters, but was defeated 6‚Äì8 by Thomas Engert. Two years later, he joined the International Pool Tour and continued competing in events sanctioned by other organizations. Ortmann won the 2007 WPA World Straight Pool Championship, defeating Danny Barouty 200‚Äì56, Dennis Orcollo 200‚Äì7, and Danny Harriman 200‚Äì123 to reach the final. There, he defeated Huidji See 200‚Äì171 for his second world championship. Ortmann made the tournament's third-highest , a 131. He also played in the 2007 World Pool Masters, defeating Naoyuki ≈åi 8‚Äì3 in the first round before losing 3‚Äì8 in the quarter-finals to David Alcaide. Ortmann reached the quarter-finals of the 2008 world straight pool championship (which he won the previous year) before losing to Jasmin Ouschan 133‚Äì200. He progressed to the semifinals the following year, defeating Earl Herring and Jonni Fulcher before losing to Mika Immonen. Ortmann won his third world championship in 2010, defeating Immonen in the straight-pool final. Since the straight-pool tournament (also known as the World Tournament) is no longer sanctioned by the WPA, Ortmann remains the last official world straight-pool champion. He is the second player to win three world championships, after Earl Strickland (who won the nine-ball championship in 1990, 1991 and 2002). =Later career (2010‚Äìpresent)= Ortmann reached the semifinals of the 2010 World Pool Masters in May of that year, defeating Darren Appleton, Thorsten Hohmann and Thomas Engert before losing 3‚Äì8 to Toru Kuribayashi. He entered the 2011 WPA World Eight-ball Championship and defeated Mika Immonen 7‚Äì2 in the double-elimination round before losing in the round of 32 to Ronato Alcano. Ortmann defeated in the first knockout round, followed by Nick van den Berg and Li Hewen, before losing to eventual champion Chang Jung-Lin the following year. His Euro Tour wins include the 2009 Netherlands Open. This victory, Ortmann's 14th on the tour, placed him second on the all-time list of winners behind Ralf Souquet (23). He has reached the semifinals of a tour event 35 times, with eight second-place finishes. Otmann was inducted into the Straight Pool Hall of Fame during a ceremony in New York City in August 2013. Two years earlier, he said: \\"It would be a great honor for me to be one day inducted into the Straight Pool Hall of Fame with the greatest players in straight pool.\\" In 2014, Ortmann was inducted into the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame with promoter and historian Charles Ursitti. He is a three-time European player of the year, receiving the award in 1990, 1993, and 1996. =Team events= Ortmann first represented Europe at the Mosconi Cup in the first competition in 1994 with the United States winning 16‚Äì12. The following year, Ortmann competed in the Continent's first win, and Ortmann was also on the winning side in 2002. The 2002 victory with Ortmann was described by six-time snooker world champion Steve Davis as \\"one of the best moments of my career\\". Ortmann competed in the team on eight occasions (1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2002, 2004), and was the non-playing captain in 2003. Ortmann's eight appearances is the fifth most of any European player. At the World Cup of Pool, Ortmann has represented Germany three times. He and Thomas Engert reached the 2006 semifinals, losing to eventual winners Efren Reyes and Francisco Bustamante of the Philippines. In 2007, Ortmann and Christian Reimering lost in the first round to Singapore's Chan Keng Kwang and Toh Lian Han. He and Ralf Souquet reached the 2010 semifinals, where they were defeated by eventual winners Li Hewen and Fu Jianbo of China. Ortmann appeared at the World Team Championship in 2010 and 2012, reaching the quarter-finals in 2010.

Early life Turkish-Cypriot Tolga Kashif was born in London. Before going on to further education, Kashif went to Forest School. His compositional and conducting studies at the Royal College of Music led him subsequently to Bristol University with Derek Bourgeois. He had his professional d√©but with the London Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, resulting in further collaborations with the City of London Sinfonia, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, Northern Sinfonia and the Wren Orchestra. He has been the Music Director of the London Amadeus Choir, which is thought to have influenced the choral elements of Queen Symphony. In 1992 he became the Associate Conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra, with whom he has enjoyed many successful orchestral concerts, particularly at the Barbican Arts Centre (formerly Barbican Hall). Kashif's work overseas has also been highly reputable. He has conducted the Polish National Symphony and the St Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1989, he worked with the London Royal Philharmonic Orchestra abroad in a series of successful concerts held as part of the Istanbul International Festival of the same year. In 1991 he was assigned the position of Permanent Guest Conductor of the Presidential Symphony Orchestra. The Music Sculptors As of 1989, Kashif's role as a creative partner in \\"The Music Sculptors\\" ‚Äì one of the principal companies specialising in sound-to-picture ‚Äì saw him combining his roles as Composer, Conductor and Producer. He worked with some more highly regarded ensembles, including the BBC Symphony, BBC Scottish Symphony and the English Chamber Orchestra. Through this programme, he co-wrote the soundtrack for Silver Fox Films' children's animation First Snow of Winter (1999), which won a British Academy of Film and Television Arts Award, a Royal Television Award and a Prix Jeunesse. Following the film's success, Kashif co-wrote the music to The Second Star to the Left (2001). He also co-wrote the soundtrack for Where the Heart Is, Q.E.D. (BBC TV series) and the BBC's documentary series concerning the Gulf War: Fighting the War. Kashif musically directed the BBC Children in Need's Platinum-selling single, Perfect Day (1997). Not only did it win many accolades and media awards, but it grossed ¬£2,125,000 for Children in Need. From 2000 to the present, he has worked with music engineer Steven Price on various advertising campaigns for Blockbuster, Vodafone, Nokia, Marmite and Zurich Insurance, to name a few. Musical Collaborations Kashif co-wrote the original score for the feature film, The Criminal (2000), with Mark Sayer-Wade, his partner at The Music Sculptors. He conducted the world premiere of his composition, The Garden of the Prophet (2000) with the English Chamber Orchestra at the Barbican Arts Centre. In 2004 he both produced and arranged Choreography for Sony Classical Records and Maksim Mrvica's Variations Part I&II; for EMI. In the same year, he conducted the ECO in Roland Chadwick's The Revealing. Kashif worked with the London Metropolitan Orchestra when recording 3 tracks for Amy Nuttall in her crossover album for EMI Classics: Best Days (2005). He used 33 strings, flutes, oboes, horns, trumpets and trombones for the songs, and they were recorded by engineer Geoff Foster at AIR Lyndhurst Hall. Kashif has worked closely with Lesley Garrett. In an interview, she claimed they go back a long way and that he has a real understanding of her sound. For her cassette, The Singer (2002), he was the conductor. He then orchestrated all of the songs in her album, When I Fall in Love (2007). This ballad collection reached no 11 in the UK Album Chart. Kashif was also invited by the famous Korean Rock Icon, Seo Taiji, to collaborate and combine Seo Taiji's past music and extraordinary hits, with Kashif's noteworthy orchestral composition and respected talent. The two presented their works at \\"The Great Seo Taiji Symphony\\" Concert held in Seoul, South Korea at the Seoul World Cup Stadium on 27 September 2008. Many Korean critics expected this collaboration to be \\"one of the most interesting projects done in Korea, yet.\\" In fact, the concert was such a huge success that an encore performance was given in December 2008. National Foundation for Youth Music In March 2002, Kashif received a commission from the NFYM to write a song for youth: Drop In the Ocean, with additional lyrics by Richard Stilgoe. The composer went on record explaining his inspiration behind the music. \\"The well known phrase 'a drop in the ocean' to me represents a universal choice for humanity; either to view ourselves as separate and insignificant or each of us as a unique part of the whole, the 'ocean' of consciousness. I think it is important for children to understand that however small we may feel at times, we all have a crucial part to play both now and in the future. May we never lose the child in us.\\" The song was recorded by the New London Children's Choir at Abbey Road Studios. It was premiered at the Royal Festival Hall, and was so successful that it received a further performance at the Commonwealth Day Observance at Westminster Abbey in the presence of Her Majesty Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. Its subsequent CD and Education Pack was mailed to every school in the country. Future Talent Along with his good friend Lesley Garrett, Kashif is a patron of the registered charity, Future Talent. This organisation strives for the high prioritisation of music in Primary schools across the UK ‚Äì they \\"nurture the musical talent of the future\\". On their website, Kashif explains why he is a proud sponsor. \\"As a child I was fortunate enough to benefit from encouragement and teaching from a wide range of sources. Through music I have had the privilege to experience remarkable moments and have seen its capacity not only to please and harmonise, but also to heal. I have great pleasure in serving Future Talent\\". Queen Symphony =History= Kashif spent two years composing the Queen Symphony. He conducted the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in its debut on Wednesday 6 November 2002. It was performed in the Royal Festival Hall and broadcast on ABC TV to a wide European audience. That night, it received a standing ovation from over two thousand people. This concert was attended by Jer Bulsara (Freddie Mercury's mother), drummer Roger Taylor and guitarist Brian May. They \\"very much enjoyed it\\" and they said it was \\"very moving indeed\\". After being recorded at Abbey Road Studios in 2002,Tolga Kashif, notes to EMI Classics recording 'Tolga Kashif: Queen Symphony' 5573952 (2002). Queen Symphony was nominated Album of the Year in the 2003 Classical Brit Awards. In 2003, Kashif directed the Northern Sinfonia in UK tours with Lesley Garrett. He conducted the Turkish premi√®re of Queen Symphony at the International Izmir Festival. He also directed the piece in Australia in two sold-out performances at the Sydney Opera House with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. These were broadcast on ABC Classic FM. He also conducted a UK tour in 2007. =Work= In 1974, Freddie Mercury said that he would \\"like people to put their own interpretation\\" on his own songs, and Kashif did just that. It is a work comprising six movements. It is based on around a dozen well-known melodies from the rock band Queen. These include \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"We Will Rock You\\", \\"We Are the Champions\\" and \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\", the latter including a performance by Nicola Loud. Some critics have compared the overall effect with the work of John Williams, notably his Star Wars score. Others have considered the choral elements of the Queen Symphony to be a nod to the rock band's own lavish tendencies, in addition to Kashif's spell as musical director of the London Amadeus Choir. The piece has been performed regularly and in 2004 received US and Dutch premi√®res. The tonal language of the symphony is diverse and draws on much of the Western classical tradition, with Kashif himself listing influences as diverse as medieval music, Romantic music and opera.Kashif (2002). There are concertante passages for piano in the second movement, and for violin and cello in the third. Movements # Adagio misterioso - Allegro con brio - Maestoso - Misterioso - Allegro (Radio Gaga, The Show Must Go On, One Vision, I Was Born To Love You) # Allegretto - Allegro scherzando - Tranquillo (Love Of My Life, Another One Bites The Dust, Killer Queen) # Adagio (Who Wants To Live Forever, Save Me) # Allegro vivo - Moderato cantabile - Cadenza - A tempo primo (Bicycle Race, Save Me) # Andante doloroso - Allegretto - Alla marcia - Moderato risoluto - Pastorale - Maestoso (Bohemian Rhapsody, We Will Rock You, We Are The Champions, Who Wants To Live Forever) # Andante sostenuto (We Are The Champions, Bohemian Rhapsody, Who Wants To Live Forever) The Genesis Suite On 11 October 2010, at the Barbican in London, Tolga Kashif conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in the world premiere of his new composition, The Genesis Suite, based on the music of the Progressive rock band Genesis. The suite was recorded that same year at Abbey Road Studios. It is composed of seven movements, based on different songs from the band. The first movement is a \\"filmic\\" adaptation of the two songs \\"Land of Confusion\\" and \\"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight\\". The second is based on \\"Ripples\\", which is for Piano and Orchestra. The third movement is a Concertante Fantasy for Violin and Orchestra, based on the tune Mad Man Moon, and is the longest piece in the suite (at 16 minutes 40 seconds long). The fourth movement is a comparatively shorter adaptation of \\"Follow You Follow Me\\". The fifth movement is based on \\"Fading Lights\\". The penultimate movement is a solo piano adaptation of \\"Entangled\\".

M. Barrie. Biography Born 20 February 1863, Davies was the second son of Mary Crompton and John Llewelyn Davies, vicar of Kirkby Lonsdale, a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, an early alpinist who was the first ascendant of the third highest mountain in the Alps, and an outspoken foe of poverty and inequality active in Christian socialist groups.Obituary of John Llewelyn Davies, The Times, Friday, 19 May 1916 His sister was suffragist Margaret Llewelyn Davies. His niece was Theodora Llewelyn Davies, the first woman admitted to the British legal profession's Inner Temple in 1920. Davies attended Marlborough College and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was briefly a master at Eton College, but left that position to practice law. Davies in 1905, with his sons Nico (in arms), Jack, Peter, George, Michael (in front) He met Sylvia du Maurier (daughter of cartoonist George du Maurier and sister of future actor Gerald du Maurier) at a dinner party in 1889 and they became engaged shortly thereafter.Birkin, Andrew, J. M. Barrie and the Lost Boys. He married her in 1892, and they had five children, all boys: George (1893‚Äì1915), Jack (1894‚Äì1959), Peter (1897‚Äì1960), Michael (1900‚Äì1921), and Nicholas (1903‚Äì1980). In 1897, his pre- school sons George and Jack became friends with J.M. Barrie, whom they met during outings in Kensington Gardens with their nurse Mary Hodgson and their infant brother Peter. He and Sylvia then met Barrie and his wife Mary at a New Year's Eve dinner party that year, and she took up a close friendship with the writer as well. Although Davies did not encourage the ongoing friendship of his wife and sons with Barrie, and did not share their fondness for him, he did little to stand in the way of it. He permitted Barrie to spend considerable time at the Davies home, and for his family to visit with the Barries ‚Äì who were childless ‚Äì at their country cottage. During one of the holidays the families spent together, Barrie took a series of photographs of the boys' adventures, which he compiled into a photo book titled The Boy Castaways; Barrie gave one of the two copies printed to Davies, who misplaced it on a train.Chaney, Lisa. Hide-and-Seek with Angels ‚Äì A Life of J. M. Barrie, London: Arrow Books, 2005 Barrie's 1901 novel The Little White Bird features characters inspired by Davies' family ‚Äì a boy David in George's age range, and the boy's mother who resembles Sylvia ‚Äì who are befriended by a thinly disguised version of the author. Barrie's play Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, inspired by Davies' boys, debuted in December 1904. The chapters of The Little White Bird featuring Peter Pan were republished in 1906 as Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, with the dedication \\"To Sylvia and Arthur Llewelyn Davies and their boys (my boys)\\". In 1904, the year when Barrie's play debuted, Davies moved with his family out of London when they purchased Egerton House, an Elizabethan mansion house in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. In 1906, he discovered a growth in his cheek which turned out to be a malignant sarcoma. He had two operations, which removed much of his upper jaw, palate, and cheekbone, and the tear duct on that side. This left him disfigured and unable to talk, even with an artificial jaw insert, but failed to remove all of the cancer and left him in considerable pain. Barrie, who had become wealthy from his books and plays, paid for his medical care, and became a regular companion at his bedside, especially in his final months. During this time, Davies described Barrie in a letter to his son Peter as \\"a very good friend to all of us\\". Family accounts differ on just how close the two actually became. Davies died at Egerton on 19 April 1907, at the age of 44. Portrayals In the 1978 BBC mini-series The Lost Boys, he was portrayed by Tim Pigott-Smith. He did not appear in the 2004 film Finding Neverland, nor the 2015 Broadway musical based on it, about Sylvia and Barrie's relationship and the writing of Peter Pan. Although he was alive for most of the events depicted, in the dramatization he was said to have already died when Barrie entered the family's life. This simplified the plot, and avoided the subject of Barrie's influence on the Davies' marriage.

Youth and education Friar was born in 1911 in Imrali, Ottoman Empire, to an American father and a Greek mother. In 1915, the family moved to the United States and Friar became an American citizen in 1920. As a child, Friar had problems with the English language, and so he spent his time on artistic efforts. At a young age, despite his trouble with English, Friar discovered poetry and later he became interested in drama. After reading Ode on a Grecian Urn by John Keats, Friar became fascinated with the energy of the English language and he determined to master it. Friar was educated at a number of institutions, including the Chicago Art Institute, the Yale School of Drama, the University of Iowa, and University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison where he received his bachelor's degree with honors in 1935. He went on to University of Michigan for his master's degree in 1940, and he won the Avery Hopwood Major Award for Yeats: A Vision. Poetry and teaching Although he was dedicated to writing and translating poetry, Friar began teaching to support himself soon after leaving the University of Michigan. He taught English at Adelphi from 1940‚Äì1945, at Amherst College from 1945‚Äì1946, at New York University from 1952‚Äì1953, and at University of Minnesota Duluth from 1953-1954. He also served as a visiting lecturer at UC Berkeley, the University of Illinois, Indiana University, and the Ohio State University. During these years, Friar organized poetry readings for the pleasure of the public. He was the director of the Poetry Center in the YW/YMHA in New York City from 1943-1946 where he encouraged famous poets and amateurs to read their poetry at receptions. From 1951-1952, Friar ran the Theatre Circle at the Circle in the Square Theatre, also in New York City. The plays produced there were primarily from the works of Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, Lillian Hellman, and Archibald MacLeish. During his time at Amherst, Friar became the teacher and first lover of American poet James Merrill. According to Merrill scholar Langdon Hammer, Friar's \\"influence would go on unfolding for the rest of Merrill's poetic career.\\" Editor and translator Friar acted as the editor, from 1960‚Äì1962, of The Charioteer, and from 1963‚Äì1965, of Greek Heritage, two magazines dealing with Greek culture. Friar had been translating poetry from Greek into English, speaking both languages fluently and gaining a perspective on modern Greek poetry. He wrote, translated, and edited innumerable works, including Modern Poetry: American and British (with John Malcolm Brinnin) in 1951, the 1960 translation of Saviors of God and the 1963 translation of Sodom and Gomorrah by Nikos Kazantzakis, and the 1973 anthology Modern Greek Poetry: from Cavafis to Elytis. However, Friar is best known for his translation of Kazantzakis' epic poem The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel. Friar completed this work in 1958 after several years of close collaboration with the author. Some critics declared that Friar lost his way in the double adjectives and complex language of the original (Kazantzakis used ancient vocabulary that is generally unknown to metropolitan scholars), and others agreed that Friar was at his best when he chose the prosaic word over the contrived or archaic. A Time magazine reviewer regarded The Odyssey as \\"a masterpiece. Kimon Friar received from Kazantzakis the ultimate praise: that his translation was as good as the original.\\" Death and honors In 1978, Friar received the Greek World Award. Then, in 1986, he won both a Ford Foundation grant and a National Foundation of the Arts and Humanities grant. He is quoted as saying: \\"I like to say that the poet in a translation should be heard, but the translator should be overheard.\\" He spent his last years in Greece and died on May 25, 1993.

This equates to roughly 11,538 downloads per issue. Format Polyglot's issues were numbered in a volume/issue format that is similar to how printed magazines are numbered; that is, not sequentially. For example, the 27th issue of Polyglot was not \\"Polyglot issue #27\\" but \\"Polyglot Volume #2 Issue #1.\\" Polyglot was formatted as a US letter size PDF. It is divided into two sections, one for \\"traditional\\" games (the term the company uses to describe RPGs, card games, board games, miniatures, etc.) and one for \\"digital\\" games. Every page of Polyglot has a banner image of the top containing Polyglot's logo. There are two different logos, one for the \\"traditional\\" gaming section and one for the \\"digital\\" gaming section. The front page of each of the two sections has a slightly larger logo. The \\"traditional\\" gaming section's logo has the slogan \\"the language of gaming\\" and the digital section's logo simply says \\"digital section.\\" In both sections, the logos have different colors on each page, repeated in sequence (there are 5 different colors for the \\"traditional\\" section\\" and 4 for the \\"electronic\\" section).

Polyglot also regularly has had marketing and publicity material from Mayfair Games (known for Settlers of Catan) and other German game companies. Several miniatures companies also send to Polyglot (usually including color photos of their products) including Games Workshop and Rackham Miniatures. Traditional wargame companies like Amarillo Design Bureau and Avalanche Press also have sent product announcements on a regular basis. Some toy companies (e.g. Briarpatch), conventions (e.g. Gen Con), game industry professional associations (e.g. GAMA, and film festivals (e.g. Fantasia) have also had marketing material appear in Polyglot's \\"Traditional\\" gaming section. The various computer games that have been featured in Polyglot include Activision, id Software, Electronic Arts, MTV (who have a game studio), Ubisoft, and numerous smaller companies.

When spheres are eliminated, adjacent spheres which now form a segment of three or more or the same color will also explode in a chain reaction. During gameplay, the on-screen spheres continuously move forward, pushed by additional small scarabs. If any sphere reaches the player's pyramid, he or she loses a life and is forced to restart the stage. If the player succeeds in eliminating a certain number of spheres without this occurring, new spheres cease to arrive and the level can be completed by removing those which remain. There are a total of 88 rounds of increasing difficulty, plus 13 bonus rounds which the player can play through. In \\"Story mode\\", the player earns titles/rankings as he or she progresses through the various levels. Multiple difficulty settings are available as well, with play at higher settings yielding higher scores. =Levels and stages= The arrangement of the levels of Luxor 2 are similar to the arrangement of rounds in Zuma. There are four levels in the first stage, five in the second, and six in the third. The order of levels repeats after every third stage, however, one stage is added in this repetition. For example, levels 1‚Äì1 to 1-4 are repeated as levels 4‚Äì1 to 4-4, but level 4-5 is added. Levels 4‚Äì1 to 4-5 are repeated as levels 7‚Äì1 to 7‚Äì5, but level 7-6 is added. This is also true for the other levels, except that for the 13th and 14th stage, with five additional levels in 13th stage and four in 14th stage before entering level 14‚Äì5, the last level.  Scoring  In general, 100 points are awarded for each sphere destroyed. The simple destruction of three spheres thus earns 300 points, four spheres 400, etc. However, if you arrange things such that you destroy three spheres which bring together three more spheres, the second set of spheres has a 2X multiplier. With cleverness, you can arrange things such that you have several chain reactions in a row with linearly increasing multipliers at every stage of the chain reaction. At the end of every round (and at times during the round) jewels, rings, and coins are freed. Every stage has coins, and coins have a value of 250 points at all stages of game play (One collects coins less for their value than because every 30 coins earns an extra life.) In contrast to the behavior of coins, jewel and ring values increase in a simple pattern as play progresses.Jewel values were determined through game play and many screen captures to assure that values were read properly. Every stage has two types of jewel and one type of ring. Below are the listed the jewels and rings in the first five stages of play: =Jewels and Rings vs. Stage= Stage 1 (comprising rounds 1‚Äì1 to 1-4) * Orange octahedral jewel (500) * Rose quartz jewel (750) * Gold ring (1000) Stage 2 (comprising rounds 2‚Äì1 to 2-5) * Rose quartz jewel (750) * Gold ring (1000) * Dark purple guitar-pick shaped jewel (1250) Stage 3 (comprising rounds 3‚Äì1 to 3-6) * Gold ring (1000) * Dark purple guitar-pick shaped jewel (1250) * Green octahedral jewel (1500) Stage 4 * Dark purple guitar-pick shaped jewel (1250) * Green octahedral jewel (1500) * Gold and colored-enamel ring (1750) Stage 5 * Green octahedral jewel (1500) * Gold and colored-enamel ring (1750) * Amber icosahedral jewel (2000) Inspecting the above list reveals a pattern, which has been verified to be consistent throughout all 14 stages of game-play. At each stage N, the value of the \\"mean\\" jewel is 500+250*N. Each stage also has a jewel or ring with a value 250 points less than the mean and another valued 250 points greater than the mean. As one advances to the next stage, the least valuable jewel/ring drops out and a new one is added in the most valuable spot. A new ring appears every three stage. Thus at the 14th and highest stage, one would expect the mean jewel to have the value 500+250*14=4000 points. Power-ups The title includes between 13 and 15 different power-ups which can be collected during play. These are earned by successfully setting off three or more explosions in a row. When this occurs, a random power-up falls down towards the player's winged scarab, but is only actually collected if the player correctly positions the scarab to catch it. Once a power-up is collected, it either has an immediate effect, or modifies the next sphere which the player will launch, depending on type. Unique or new power-ups include: * Color Cloud - Causes a cloud effect which changes the color of all spheres it envelopes to the matching color. * Lightning Storm - Causes a series of ten lightning blasts to strike and randomly eliminate spheres. * Net- collects falling objects all across the playfield. * Pharaoh's Dagger - Changes the player's \\"next sphere\\" into a dagger which can be used to destroy any spheres it hits for a period of time. Additional power-ups are modeled after those from existing games, such as one which slows down the movement of the spheres, and one which causes the spheres to move backward for a short while. Cheats (PC version only) In the Options menu, press the Page Up and Page Down at the same to activate the cheat mode. A new button, \\"Cheats\\", will appear. It will be valid only to this specific profile. Cheat mode makes all stages and levels of game play accessible.Cheat information was verified empirically through game play and testing.

Treasures of Knowledge (aka Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? and Carmen Sandiego Treasures of Knowledge) is a point-and-click adventure game in the Carmen Sandiego franchise, released in 2001. For its title, the game does not use the long-standing formula of the previous Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? titles. Instead, the game seems to be based on the structure of the newest version of Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego?, which The Learning Company retitled Carmen Sandiego's Great Chase Through Time. Design =Art= Artist John Hays of Wild Brain Studios designed and directed the character artwork and animation for the game, giving a new makeover from the previous games. =Educational Goals= The idea of the game was to reinforce knowledge of worldwide history, geography, religions, art, architecture and culture of 50 different countries to users in an entertaining and absorbing way. A translator feature was also included to incorporate teachings of foreign languages. In addition each mission encourages players to explore, examine clues, map read, identify landmarks and artifacts and learn words and meanings. The minigames and puzzles also serve to keep the player amused. Players are free to go through the game at their own pace, stopping to thoroughly explore any locale. Plot The protagonists of the game are Julia \\"Jules\\" Argent, an experienced ACME detective and Carmen's former partner, and Shadow Hawkins, a new ACME recruit who is gadget-happy and rather arrogant. Jules and Shadow's personalities frequently bounce off each over the course of the game, similar to how Zack and Ivy were paired up in Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?, in that they had trouble with each other, but in the end, they both got along. The Chief explains that she has paired them together because she believes their personalities complement each other and indeed by the end of the game they appear to have gained some respect for each other's methods (or have at least agreed to disagree.) Carmen steals a rare Franco-Italian edition of The Travels of Marco Polo and then proceeds to steal a MƒÅori wood carving, Incan Quipus and other seemingly random items. Jules and Shadow find that each object Carmen has stolen seems to be tied to a mysterious Portuguese explorer, a lost city with a great treasure and a strange \\"wheel\\" design. On the eighth and final case, Jules and Shadow track down the lost city itself. Once inside the city, however, they find Carmen sitting inside a chamber filled with priceless treasures. Carmen suggests that she may be planning to lock Jules and Shadow away in the city, but Jules insists that Carmen would not do such a thing. Shadow captures Carmen by grabbing her wrist with a grapple launcher, but she inexplicably escapes through the use of a smoke bomb. Jules and Shadow debate if Carmen led them to the treasure for ethical reasons or if she is simply a bad person. Whatever were Carmen's true motivations remain a mystery. Gameplay The game is divided into seven missions. The goal of each missions is to recover one item of the stolen artefacts, which Carmen has hidden in a puzzle somewhere in the world. The user can only unlock this puzzle by collecting items or clues from other countries, often having to solve other puzzles first. A database can be used to find out where a place is and where an item can be found. At the end of each case, the item is found and it is announced that Carmen has stolen something else. Critical reception The Philadelphia Inquirer thought the graphics were \\"hopelessly primitive\\" when compared to contemporary Xbox and PlayStation titles. Learning Village called the title \\"completely updated and significantly enriched\\" when compared to the original 1985 version, and praised both the animation and storyline for being more sophisticated. The Washington Post was disappointed that the animation was reminiscent of a Saturday morning cartoon, but thought the storyline made up for this, ultimately recommending the game. The title was one of four featured in The Learning Company pack called Enhanced Educator Versions; this version of the game had a Class Progress Report that maintained and updated the progress of the player.

She testified that he had sexually abused her since she was eight years old. Sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, she served 18 years. On January 10, 2009, outgoing Missouri Governor Matt Blunt commuted Lannert's sentence and that of another woman convicted under similar circumstances. He said, \\"After an exhaustive review of the facts in both cases, I am commuting the sentences of Stacey Lannert and Charity Carey, who suffered extensive abuse before they took action against the men who raped them and subjected them to other horrible physical and emotional abuse.\\"JOAN MARTELLI, \\"Convicted Murderer Released After 18 Years in Prison\\", ABC News 2020, 26 March 2009, accessed 12 September 2014 Lannert's new sentence of 20 years made her eligible for immediate conditional release, and she was released on January 16, 2009. Lannert founded a resource website and non-profit organization, Healing Sisters, to aid women who have suffered abuse. In 2011, she published a memoir about her experiences, Redemption: A Story of Sisterhood, Survival, and Finding Freedom Behind Bars. Early life and education Stacey Lannert was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1972, the daughter of Deb Underwood and Thomas Lannert. She has said that she was close to her father and he made her feel special, but he was drinking to excess and started sexually abusing her when she was eight, and raped her at nine. Her parents divorced when she was young. Although she tried to tell her mother and a babysitter about her father's rapes, she did not have the language to make them understand, and he had threatened her to keep her quiet. Her sister Christy, two years younger, has said their father physically abused and beat her from when she was in first grade, becoming especially violent when drinking. Stacey Lannert went to live with her mother, then in Guam, six months before the murder. Her sister Christy begged her to return, and Lannert tried to persuade her father to let Christy live with her and her mother. He would not let her go. The crime and the trial At the age of 18, in the town of St. John, Missouri, Lannert shot her father twice while he was sleeping on a sofa. After confessing to killing him, she said that he had repeatedly raped and abused her as a child, threatening her so she would maintain secrecy. She said that, based on fears for her sister, she had decided to kill him to stop him. She testified that on July 4, 1990, she and her sister got home late, entering the house via a basement window at approximately 4:15‚Äì4:30a.m. Seeing a rifle, she decided to kill her father. Finding her father asleep on the sofa, she shot him. This shot broke his collarbone and startled him awake. In fear, Stacey closed her eyes and shot again. The next day, she consulted with an adult friend, who encouraged her and helped her to dispose of the murder weapon. She called the police, initially pretending to have found her father dead on the sofa upon returning home, but then confessed the murder to Lt.Tom Schulte, saying it was because of the years of abuse she had suffered. Stacey Lannert was charged with first degree murder and other felonies. Lannert's lawyer offered the defense of insanity or mental defect after his attempt to use the \\"battered spouse syndrome\\" in her defense. In a pre-trial ruling, the court limited mention of \\"battered spouse syndrome\\" but allowed the defendant to make \\"an offer of proof of self-defense\\". The St. Louis County prosecutor, Bob McCulloch, never called Schulte to testify, although he was the first official to talk with Lannert and had years of experience with sexual abuse victims. The prosecutors alleged that she murdered her father because she wanted his money. Lannert claimed that her father had sexually abused her from the age of eight. She said although she had reported the abuse to her guidance counselor, babysitter, and psychiatrist, no one took action to help her. During his instructions to the jury, the judge refused to include any claim of self- defense: \\"[Under] Missouri law, the self-defense argument was not valid because she wasn't in actual danger at the moment she pulled the trigger.\\" The judge concluded that there was not any basis in the evidence for her claim of self-defense. Despite several expert witnesses having testified and agreed during Lannert's trial (and later appeal) that Lannert showed signs of abuse, the jury found her guilty in 1992 and sentenced her to life imprisonment, without (as required by applicable law) the possibility of parole. Her sister Christy was tried and convicted of conspiracy to commit murder. She was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. She was released on parole after serving two and a half years. Time served and appeals After the judge's sentencing, some members of the jury expressed outrage that facts of sexual and physical abuse suffered by Lannert had not been introduced at the trial. The presiding judge, the Hon. Steven H. Goldman, issued this statement regarding Stacey Lannert's case: > [The] sentence is severe for a 20 year old. It is also somewhat surprising > considering the evidence of sexual abuse by the victim's father...[a] > conventional life sentence would be more appropriate from a comparison > standpoint.\\"Free Stacey Lannert\\" quotes. The Missouri Court of Appeals found in favor of the trial judge. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, issued this statement after Lannert filed a petition for appeal: > The 'absence of aggression or provocation on the part of the defender' > element of the Missouri self-defense statute does not articulate a time > frame during which the initial act of aggression and the act of self-defense > must occur. It is therefore deeply troubling that the jury was not > completely informed of the scope of the abuse Lannert suffered, her fear, or > her rage that her sister may also have been victimized by their father. This > evidence of battered spouse syndrome might have placed Lannert's actions in > proper context, and may have allowed a jury to conclude that Lannert was not > the initial aggressor on the night of her father's death, potentially > resulting in a very different outcome than what she faces today.\\" On March 11, 2003, the court ruled in favor of the original trial judge, though \\"reluctantly.\\" It held that Lannert's appeal failed before the cited standards: > Deadly force may be used in self-defense only when there is (1) an absence > of aggression or provocation on the part of the defender, (2) a real, or > apparently real, necessity for the defender to kill in order to save himself > from an immediate danger of serious bodily injury or death, (3) a reasonable > cause for the defender's belief in such necessity, and (4) an attempt by the > defender to do all within his power consistent with his personal safety to > avoid the danger and the need to take a life. The court rejected Lannert's position that \\"a man who raped his daughter, when she was in the third grade, made him 'the initial aggressor', and the author of his own doom\\". More crucially, the court noted that the battered spouse syndrome does not amount to a defense in itself, but is a support for a claim of self-defense, indicating the frame of mind in which the defendant finds herself at the time of the act. The court declined to override Missouri's rules for jury instruction or interpretation of the battered spouse syndrome law. Lannert, after exhausting all of her appeals, sought from Missouri Governor Matt Blunt either commutation of her sentence to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 15 years (she had already served 18 years) or pardon. She had gained support for clemency. On January 10, 2009, the outgoing governor announced the commutation, after completing an \\"exhaustive review of the evidence,\\" in which he determined that Lannert had suffered extensive abuse by her father, Thomas Lannert. In view of time served, Stacey Lannert was soon released from prison. McCulloch has said he does not believe her claims of abuse. Lannert was described as having been a 'model prisoner,' active in many different community projects, as well as helping other survivors of incest and abuse. She also trained service dogs for the handicapped, in addition to being president of the Outreach program; an organization that brings troubled teens to prison to meet inmates with the incentive to warn them to take a different path in life. Stacey Lannert has since founded Healing Sisters, a resource website and non-profit organization to aid women who have suffered abuse, as well as to work to end sexual abuse in the United States. She has appeared as a guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show on May 14, 2009; The Joy Behar Show on March 16, 2011; and Piers Morgan Tonight on April 20, 2011. In 2011 she published a memoir, written with Kristen Kemp: Redemption: A Story of Sisterhood, Survival, and Finding Freedom Behind Bars.

Users could post keeks to the Keek website using a webcam or via the Keek mobile apps for iPhone, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, or Android. Users could also reply back with text or video comments, known as \\"keekbacks\\", and share content to other major social media networks. There was also an embed option so users could embed their keeks into a blog or website. Origins The word \\"Keek\\" comes from Scots and means a look, especially a quick one. Keek Inc. is based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and has around 45 employees. Keek launched in early 2011 to \\"create a social network that was more authentic and personal. We are committed to delivering the fastest, most engaging social video experience,\\" CEO Isaac Raichyk said in an interview. Reception Keek has been described as \\"the revival of rareware \\", \\"Instagram of video\\" and a \\"micro version of YouTube\\". and is often compared to a combination of other major social media networks such as Facebook, YouTube, Tumblr and Twitter. \\"Keek is more like a combination of YouTube, Facebook and Twitter than its direct competitors.\\" \\"What makes Keek different is that it focuses on short, personal video uploads. A 'keek' can only be 36 seconds long, and is usually uploaded directly from a webcam or smartphone camera. So unlike many of the professional vloggers floating around on YouTube, the content is less polished ‚Äì but also far quicker and reactive. Think of it like Twitter or Tumblr, only this time focused solely on video.\\" Keek has been described as a \\"new wave in social media technology\\" in reaction to the growth it received in 2012. Growth In 2012 the Keek community started generating a large amount of original content posting 66,000 videos per day. With the launch of the Keek mobile apps for iOS and Android in March 2012, there was a significant increase in the community and creation of content. Keek added 2 Million users in October 2012 and served 250 million pageviews. By January 2013 Keek was adding 200,000 users per day to its social network and users were generating 4 million videos per month. In March 2013, Keek announced the launch of verified accounts. Individuals or businesses can qualify for account verification if they are at high risk of impersonation or if they have large audiences on Keek or other social networks. Also in March, Keek launched a BlackBerry version of their app allowing BlackBerry 10 users the ability to share videos on Keek, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Email or via SMS. Between March 2013 and June 2013 Keek added 24 million users to bring its network to a total of 45 million registered users. On May 17, 2013 Keek added a new private messaging feature, allowing users to privately chat using video or text with up to 36 people at once. Keek launched a developer portal with API access on June 14, 2013. The new API program will allow developers to access public keeks, search functionality, user profiles, Klusters and more. Keek launched a Windows phone version of their app on June 27, 2013. In August 2013 Keek reached a total of 58 million users growing at the rate of 250,000 new users a day. Keek has been the top video app in 18 countries globally. However, by October 2013 Keek was struggling to raise more venture capital funding through investment firm Morgan Stanley and was forced to downsize its operation to half a dozen staff members. By November 2013 a reverse takeover bid was announced by oil company Primary Petroleum. The reverse takeover would see Primary Petroleum sell off all of its oil holdings and change its name to Keek Inc, effectively merging the two companies, and bringing Keek to the public stock market. During this time co-founder and CEO Isaac Raichyk left Keek to found a new mobile dating platform called Clover of which he is now CEO. As of June 2014 Keek was set to expand its offices into New York City, and had changed its upper management to include Jamie King as CPO, Lin Dai as CMO, and Alexandra Cameron as the new CEO. On October 31, 2016, Keek was rebranded as Peeks Video. Apps =iOS= The current version of the Keek iOS app is compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch running iOS 6.0 or later.

History The reservoir was built at the end of the 19th century to provide drinking water for parts of southeast Northumberland. Flora and fauna The north shore is mainly vegetated with scrub and woodland, including willow, blackthorn, elder, birch, hawthorn, and hazel. Common spotted orchids grow in the base-rich flushed areas. At the extreme south eastern corner of the site there is an area of marshy grassland with abundant meadow-sweet, wild angelica, common knapweed, and sneezewort and where there is periodic flooding of the shore you can also find species like common spike rush, reed canary grass, lesser spearwort, and amphibious bistort. The presence of four British reptiles; common lizard, adder, slowworm, and grass snake, and five of Britain‚Äôs native amphibians; common frog, common toad, smooth newt, palmate newt, and great crested newt mean that this an extremely valuable and important wildlife site. The grass snake records for Fontburn make this one of the most northerly authenticated colonies of this species in Britain. A Site of Special Scientific Interest, Fallowlees Flush, lies immediately to the west of Fontburn, on the slopes of one of its tributary streams. Fishing The reservoir is regularly stocked with trout and is a favoured place with fresh water anglers. Fontburn Reservoir is one of our smaller waters and consequently has a reputation as being a friendly, family orientated fishery. For more information on visiting Fontburn Reservoir go to NWWaterside Parks. Ancient monuments Close to the reservoir there are ancient Bronze Age sites which are easily reached on foot. The area is also popular with hill walkers.

This can take place in humans and animals and is often attributed to rapid environmental change. Timeline showing a period of mismatch following an environmental change. Mismatch theory represents the idea that traits that evolved in an organism in one environment can be disadvantageous in a different environment. This environmental change leading to evolutionary mismatch can be broken down into two major categories: temporal (change of the existing environment over time, e.g. a climate change) or spatial (placing organisms into a new environment, e.g. a population migrating). Since environmental change occurs naturally and constantly, there will certainly be examples of evolutionary mismatch over time. However, because large-scale natural environmental change ‚Äì like a natural disaster ‚Äì is often rare, it is less often observed. Another more prevalent kind of environmental change is anthropogenic (human-caused). In recent times, humans have had a large, rapid, and trackable impact on our environment, thus creating scenarios where it is easier to observe evolutionary mismatch. Because of the mechanism of evolution by natural selection, the environment (\\"nature\\") determines (\\"selects\\") which traits will persist in a population. Therefore, there will be a gradual weeding out of disadvantageous traits over several generations as the population becomes more adapted to its environment. Any significant change in a population's traits that cannot be attributed to other factors (such as genetic drift and mutation) will be responsive to a change in that population's environment; in other words, natural selection is inherently reactive. Shortly following an environmental change, traits that evolved in the previous environment, whether they were advantageous or neutral, are persistent for several generations in the new environment. Because evolution is gradual and environmental changes often occur very quickly on a geological scale, there is always a period of \\"catching-up\\" as the population evolves to become adapted to the environment. It is this temporary period of \\"disequilibrium\\" that is referred to as mismatch. Mismatched traits are ultimately addressed in one of several possible ways: the organism may evolve such that the maladaptive trait is no longer expressed, the organism may decline and/or become extinct as a result of the disadvantageous trait, or the environment may change such that the trait is no longer selected against.  History  As evolutionary thought became more prevalent, scientists studied and attempted to explain the existence of disadvantageous traits, known as maladaptations, that are the basis of evolutionary mismatch. The theory of evolutionary mismatch began under the term evolutionary trap as early as the 1940s. In his 1942 book, evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr described evolutionary traps as the phenomenon that occurs when a genetically uniform population suited for a single set of environmental conditions is susceptible to extinction from sudden environment changes. Since then, key scientists such as Warren J. Gross and Edward O. Wilson have studied and identified numerous examples of evolutionary traps. The first occurrence of the term \\"evolutionary mismatch\\" may have been in a paper by Jack E. Riggs published in the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology in 1993. In the years to follow, the term evolutionary mismatch has become widely used to describe biological maladaptations in a wide range of disciplines. A coalition of modern scientists and community organizers assembled to found the Evolution Institute in 2008, and in 2011 published a more recent culmination of information on evolutionary mismatch theory in an article by Elisabeth Lloyd, David Sloan Wilson, and Elliott Sober. In 2018 a popular science book appeared by evolutionary psychologists on evolutionary mismatch and the implications for humans Many members of the scientific community continue to explore the effects of evolutionary mismatch in our quickly changing world.  Mismatch in human evolution  = The Neolithic Revolution: transitional context = The Neolithic Revolution brought about significant evolutionary changes in humans; namely the transition from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, in which humans foraged for food, to an agricultural lifestyle. This change occurred approximately 10,000‚Äì12,000 years ago. Humans began to domesticate both plants and animals, allowing for the maintenance of constant food resources. This transition quickly and dramatically changed the way that humans interact with the environment, with societies taking up practices of farming and animal husbandry. However, human bodies had evolved to be adapted to their previous foraging lifestyle. The slow pace of evolution in comparison with the very fast pace of human advancement allowed for the persistence of these adaptations in an environment where they are no longer necessary. In human societies that now function in a vastly different way from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle, these outdated adaptations now lead to the presence of maladaptive, or mismatched, traits. Some modern human populations engage in hunter-gatherer practices. = Human disease =  Obesity and diabetes  Human bodies are predisposed to maintain homeostasis, especially when storing energy as fat. This trait serves as the main basis for the \\"thrifty gene hypothesis\\", the idea that \\"feast-or-famine conditions during human evolutionary development naturally selected for people whose bodies were efficient in their use of food calories\\". Hunter-gatherers, who used to live under environmental stress, benefit from this trait; there was an uncertainty of when the next meal would be, and they would spend most of their time performing high levels of physical activity. Therefore, those that consumed many calories would store the extra energy as fat, which they could draw upon in times of hunger. However, modern humans have evolved to a world of more sedentary lifestyles and convenience foods. People are sitting more throughout their days, whether it be in their cars during rush hour or in their cubicles during their full- time jobs. Less physical activity in general means fewer calories burned throughout the day. Human diets have changed considerably over the 10,000 years since the advent of agriculture, with more processed foods in their diets that lack nutritional value and lead them to consume more sodium, sugar, and fat. These high calorie, nutrient-deficient foods cause people to consume more calories than they burn. Fast food combined with decreased physical activity means that the \\"thrifty gene\\" that once benefit human predecessors now works against them, causing their bodies to store more fat and leading to higher levels of obesity in the population. Obesity is one consequence of mismatched genes. Known as \\"metabolic syndrome\\", this condition is also associated with other health concerns, including insulin resistance, where the body no longer responds to insulin secretion, so blood glucose levels are unable to be lowered, which can lead to type 2 diabetes.  Osteoporosis  Another human disorder that can be explained by mismatch theory is the rise in osteoporosis in modern humans. In advanced societies, many people, especially women, are remarkably susceptible to osteoporosis during aging. Fossil evidence has suggested that this was not always the case, with bones from elderly hunter-gatherer women often showing no evidence of osteoporosis. Evolutionary biologists have posited that the increase in osteoporosis in modern Western populations is likely due to our considerably sedentary lifestyles. Women in hunter-gatherer societies were physically active both from a young age and well into their late-adult lives. This constant physical activity likely lead to peak bone mass being considerably higher in hunter- gatherer humans than in modern-day humans. While the pattern of bone mass degradation during aging is purportedly the same for both hunter-gatherers and modern humans, the higher peak bone mass associated with more physical activity may have led hunter-gatherers to be able to develop a propensity to avoid osteoporosis during aging.  Hygiene hypothesis  The hygiene hypothesis, a concept initially theorized by immunologists and epidemiologists, has been proved to have a strong connection with evolutionary mismatch through recent year studies. Hygiene hypothesis states that the profound increase in allergies, autoimmune diseases, and some other chronic inflammatory diseases is related to the reduced exposure of the immune system to antigens. Such reduced exposure is more common in industrialized countries and especially urban areas, where the inflammatory chronic diseases are also more frequently seen. Recent analysis and studies have tied the hygiene hypothesis and evolutionary mismatch together. Some researchers suggest that the overly sterilized urban environment changes or depletes the microbiota composition and diversity. Such environmental conditions favor the development of the inflammatory chronic diseases because human bodies have been selected to adapt to a pathogen-rich environment in the history of evolution. For example, studies have shown that change in our symbiont community can lead to the disorder of immune homeostasis, which can be used to explain why antibiotic use in early childhood can result in higher asthma risk. Because the change or depletion of the microbiome is often associated with hygiene hypothesis, the hypothesis is sometimes also called \\"biome depletion theory\\". = Human behavior = Behavioral examples of evolutionary mismatch theory include the abuse of dopaminergic pathways and the reward system. An action or behavior that stimulates the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter known for generating a sense of pleasure, will likely be repeated since the brain is programmed to continually seek such pleasure. In hunter-gatherer societies, this reward system was beneficial for survival and reproductive success. But now, when there are fewer challenges to survival and reproducing, certain activities in the present environment (gambling, drug use, eating) exploit this system, leading to addictive behaviors.  Work stress  Examples of evolutionary mismatch also occur in the modern workplace. Unlike our hunter- gatherer ancestors who lived in small egalitarian societies the modern work place is large, complex, and hierarchical. Humans spend significant amounts of time interacting with strangers in conditions that are very different from those of our ancestral past. Hunter-gatherers do not separate work from their private lives, they have no bosses to be accountable to, or no deadlines to adhere to. Our stress system reacts to immediate threats and opportunities. The modern workplace exploits evolved psychological mechanisms that are aimed at immediate survival or longer-term reproduction. These basic instincts misfire in the modern workplace, causing conflicts at work, burnout, job alienation and poor management practices.  Postnatal Depression   Posttraumatic Stress Disorder among Combat Veterans   Gambling  There are two aspects of gambling that make it an addictive activity: chance and risk. Chance gives gambling its novelty. Back when humans had to forage and hunt for food, novelty-seeking was advantageous for them, particularly for their diet. However, with the development of casinos, this trait of pursuing novelties has become disadvantageous. Risk assessment, the other behavioral trait applicable to gambling, was also beneficial to hunter-gatherers in the face of danger. However, the types of risks hunter-gatherers had to assess are significantly different and more life-threatening than the risks people now face. The attraction to gambling stems from the attraction to risk and reward related activity.  Drug addiction  Herbivores have created selective pressure for plants to possess specific molecules that deter plant consumption, such as nicotine, morphine, and cocaine. Plant-based drugs, however, have reinforcing and rewarding effects on the human neurological system, suggesting a \\"paradox of drug reward\\" in humans. Human behavioral evolutionary mismatch explains the contradiction between plant evolution and human drug use. In the last 10,000 years, humans found the dopaminergic system, or reward system, particularly useful in optimizing Darwinian fitness. While drug use has been a common characteristic of past human populations, drug use involving potent substances and diverse intake methods is a relatively contemporary feature of society. Human ancestors lived in an environment that lacked drug use of this nature, so the reward system was primarily used in maximizing survival and reproductive success. In contrast, present-day humans live in a world where the current nature of drugs render the reward system maladaptive. This class of drugs falsely triggers a fitness benefit in the reward system, leaving people susceptible to drug addiction. The modern-day dopaminergic system presents vulnerabilities to the difference in accessibility and social perception of drugs.  Eating  In the era of foraging for food, hunter-gatherers rarely knew where their next meal would come from. As a result, filling their stomachs up with lots of food was advantageous since food was scarce. Intense consumption of high-energy foods was selected for when the availability of food was low and it was more difficult to find. Now, food is readily available, and the neurological system that once helped people recognize the survival advantages of essential eating has now become disadvantageous as it promotes overeating. This has become especially dangerous after the rise of processed foods, as the popularity of foods that have unnaturally high levels of sugar and fat has significantly increased.  Non-human examples  Evolutionary mismatch can occur any time an organism is exposed to an environment that does not resemble the typical environment the organism adapted in. Due to human influences, such as global warming and habitat destruction, the environment is changing very rapidly for many organisms, leading to numerous cases of evolutionary mismatch. = Examples with human influence =  Sea turtles and light pollution  Female sea turtles create nests to lay their eggs by digging a pit on the beach, typically between the high tide line and dune, using their rear flippers. Consequently, within the first seven days of hatching, hatchling sea turtles must make the journey from the nest back into the ocean. This trip occurs predominantly at night in order to avoid predators and overheating. Hatchling sea turtles must make their way back into the ocean. In order to orient themselves towards the ocean, the hatchlings depend on their eyes to turn towards the brightest direction. This is because the open horizon of the ocean, illuminated by celestial light, tends to be much brighter in a natural undeveloped beach than the dunes and vegetation. Studies propose two mechanisms of the eye for this phenomenon. Referred to as the \\"raster system\\", the theory is that sea turtles' eyes contain numerous light sensors which take in the overall brightness information of a general area and make a \\"measurement\\" of where the light is most intense. If the light sensors detect the most intense light on a hatchling's left side, the sea turtle would turn left. A similar proposal called the complex phototropotaxis system theorizes that the eyes contain light intensity comparators that take in detailed information of the intensity of light from all directions. Sea turtles are able to \\"know\\" that they are facing the brightest direction when the light intensity is balanced between both eyes. This method of finding the ocean is successful in natural beaches, but in developed beaches, the intense artificial lights from buildings, light houses, and even abandoned fires overwhelm the sea turtles and cause them to head towards the artificial light instead of the ocean. Scientists call this misorientation. Sea turtles can also become disoriented and circle around in the same place. Numerous cases show that misoriented hatchling sea turtles either die from dehydration, get consumed by a predator, or even burn to death in an abandoned fire. The direct impact of light pollution on the number of sea turtles has been too difficult to measure. However, this problem is exacerbated because all species of sea turtles are endangered. Other animals, including migratory birds and insects, are also victims to light pollution because they also depend on light intensity at night to properly orient themselves. (See Threats to sea turtles for more information.)  Dodo bird and hunting  Dodo birds became completely extinct due to hunting. The Dodo bird lived on a remote Island, Mauritius, in the absence of predators. Here, the Dodo evolved to lose its instinct for fear and the ability to fly. This allowed them to be easily hunted by Dutch sailors who arrived on the island in the late 16th century. The Dutch sailors also brought foreign animals to the island such as monkeys and pigs that ate the Dodo bird's eggs, which was detrimental to the population growth of the slow breeding bird. Their fearlessness made them easy targets and their inability to fly gave them no opportunity to evade danger. Thus, they were easily driven to extinction within a century of their discovery. The Dodo's inability to fly was once beneficial for the bird because it conserved energy. The Dodo conserved more energy relative to birds with the ability to fly, due to the Dodo's smaller pectoral muscles. Smaller muscle sizes are linked to lower rates of maintenance metabolism, which in turn conserves energy for the Dodo. Lacking an instinct for fear was another mechanism through which the Dodo conserved energy because it never had to expend any energy for a stress response. Both mechanisms of conservation of energy was once advantageous because it enabled the Dodo to execute activities with minimal energy expenditure. However, these proved disadvantageous when their island was invaded, rendering them defenseless to the new dangers that humans brought.  Peppered moths during the English Industrial Revolution  Before the English Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and early 19th centuries the most common phenotypic color of the peppered moth was white with black speckles. However, that changed when the Industrial Revolution produced high levels of pollution. Due to the Industrial Revolution the trees blackened in urban regions, causing the original phenotype to stand out significantly more to predators. Natural selection then began favoring the rare dark peppered carbonaria moth in order for the species to camouflage and prevent attacks. The dark moth's population expanded rapidly and by the 1950s vast amounts of England saw carbonaria frequencies rise above 90%. The once favorable white speckled phenotype quickly became mismatched in the new environment. However, in the late 1900s, the English made efforts to reduce air pollution, causing the trees to turn back to their normal shade. The change in color lead the dark skin phenotype to revert from beneficial to disadvantageous. Once again, the moth was not able to adapt fast enough to the changing environment and thus the carbonaria phenotype became mismatched. Since the trees' return to their natural color caused the original phenotype to become advantageous again since it allowed the peppered moth to hide from predators.  Giant jewel beetle and beer bottles  The Jewel Beetle has a shiny, brown exterior similar to that of a beer bottle Evolutionary mismatch can also be seen among insects. One such example is in the case of the Giant Jewel Beetle (Julodimorpha bakewelli). The male jewel beetle has evolved to be attracted to certain features of the female jewel beetle that allow the male jewel beetle to identify a female as it flies across the desert. These features include size, color, and texture. However, these physical traits are seen manifested in beer bottles as well. As a result, male jewel beetles often consider beer bottles more attractive than female jewel beetles due to the beer bottle's large size and attractive coloring. Beer bottles are often discarded by humans in the Australian desert that the jewel beetle thrives in, creating an environment where male jewel beetles prefer to mate with beer bottles instead of female jewel beetles. This is a situation that is extremely disadvantageous as it reduces the reproductive output of the jewel beetle as fewer beetles are mating. This condition can be considered an evolutionary mismatch, as a habit that evolved to aid in reproduction has become disadvantageous due to the littering of beer bottles, an anthropogenic cause. = Examples without human influence =  Information cascades between birds  A group of Nutmeg Mannikins at a bird feeder Normally, gaining information from watching other organisms allows the observer to make good decisions without spending effort. More specifically, birds often observe the behavior of other organisms to gain valuable information, such as the presence of predators, good breeding sites, and optimal feeding spots. Although this allows the observer to spend less effort gathering information, it can also lead to bad decisions if the information gained from observing is unreliable. In the case of the nutmeg mannikins, the observer can minimize the time spent looking for an optimal feeder and maximize its feeding time by watching where other nutmeg mannikins feed. However, this relies on the assumption that the observed mannikins also had reliable information that indicated the feeding spot was an ideal one. This behavior can become maladaptive when prioritizing information gained from watching others leads to information cascades, where birds follow the rest of the crowd even though prior experience may have suggested that the decision of the crowd is a poor one. For instance, if a nutmeg mannikin sees enough mannikins feeding at a feeder, nutmeg mannikins have been shown to choose that feeder even if their personal experience indicates that the feeder is a poor one.  House finches and the introduction of the MG disease  Evolutionary mismatch occurs in house finches when they are exposed to infectious individuals. Male house finches tend to feed in close proximity to other finches that are sick or diseased, because sick individuals are less competitive than usual, in turn making the healthy male more likely to win an aggressive interaction if it happens. To make it less likely to lose a social confrontation, healthy finches are inclined to forage near individuals that are lethargic or listless due to disease. However, this disposition has created an evolutionary trap for the finches after the introduction of the MG disease in 1994. Since this disease is infectious, healthy finches will be in danger of contraction if they are in the vicinity of individuals that have previously developed the disease. The relatively short duration of the disease's introduction has caused an inability for the finches to adapt quickly enough to avoid nearing sick individuals, which ultimately results in the mismatch between their behavior and the changing environment.  Exploitation of earthworm's reaction to vibrations  Worm charming is a practice used by people to attract earthworms out of the ground by driving in a wooden stake to vibrate the soil. This activity is commonly performed to collect fishing bait and as a competitive sport. Worms that sense the vibrations rise to the surface. Research shows that humans are actually taking advantage of a trait that worms adapted to avoid hungry burrowing moles which prey on the worms. This type of evolutionary trap, where an originally beneficial trait is exploited in order to catch prey, was coined the \\"rare enemy effect\\" by Richard Dawkins, an English evolutionary biologist. This trait of worms has been exploited not only by humans, but by other animals. Herring gulls and wood turtles have been observed to also stamp on the ground to drive the worms up to the surface and consume them.

The main campaign against Britain started in January 1915 using airships. From then until the end of World War I the German Navy and Army Luftstreitkr√§fte mounted over 50 bombing raids on the United Kingdom. These were generally referred to as \\"Zeppelin raids\\": although both Zeppelin and Sch√ºtte-Lanz airships were used, the Zeppelin company was much better known and was responsible for producing the majority of the airships used. Weather conditions and night flying conditions made airship navigation and maintaining bombing accuracy difficult. Bombs were often dropped miles off target (one raid on London actually bombed Hull) and accurate targeting of military installations was impossible. The civilian casualties made the Zeppelins an object of hatred, and they were dubbed \\"baby-killers\\". With the development of effective defensive measures the airship raids became increasingly hazardous, and in 1917 the airships were largely replaced by aeroplanes. Although the military effect of the raids was small, they caused widespread alarm, leading to the diversion of substantial resources from the Western Front and some disruption to industrial production. Concern about the conduct of defence against the raids, the responsibility for which was divided between the Admiralty and the Army, led to a parliamentary inquiry under Jan Smuts, whose report led to the creation of the Royal Air Force (RAF) on 1 April 1918. The defence organisation developed by the British was an important precursor of the fighter direction system that would prove vital in winning the Battle of Britain.Fredette 1974, p. 212 The raids were also influential because they led to an overestimation of both the material and psychological effects of the bombing of cities.Fredette 1974, p. 245 A minor consequence of the risk of being driven out of bed at night was the development of night clothes for women. Airships made about 51 bombing raids on Britain during the war. These killed 557 and injured another 1,358 people. More than 5,000 bombs were dropped on towns across Britain, causing ¬£1.5 million in damage. 84 airships took part, of which 30 were either shot down or lost in accidents.Liddell Hart 1934, p. 76. Aeroplanes carried out 27 raids, dropping of bombs for the loss of 62 aircraft, resulting in ground casualties of 835 dead, 1,972 injured and ¬£1,418,272 of material damage.Fredette 1974, p. 266 Early raids A plaque (61 Farringdon Road, London) commemorating a First World War Zeppelin raid on London On 6 August 1914 the German Army Zeppelin Z VI bombed the Belgian city of Li√®ge, killing nine civilians. This was followed by night raids on Antwerp on 25 August and 2 September. In the first month of the war Germany formed the \\"Ostend Carrier Pigeon Detachment\\", a cover name for an aeroplane unit to be used for the bombing of the English Channel ports. During the opening months of the war a German pilot flying a Taube regularly dropped bombs on Paris. The first raid consisted of five small bombs and a note demanding the immediate surrender of Paris and the French nation. Before the stabilisation of the Western Front, German aircraft made a number of raids on Paris, slightly damaging Notre Dame Cathedral. The first bombing raids on England were nuisance raids carried out against Channel ports. German press reports mention a raid carried out on 27 October, but there is no British record of any incident on this date. The first confirmed raid occurred on 21 December, when a Friedrichshafen FF.29 dropped two bombs into the sea near the Admiralty Pier in Dover. These raids, usually carried out by one or two aircraft during daytime, continued throughout the war, with little effect. Campaign against Britain =1915= British recruiting poster from 1915 Advertisement by the Daily Mail for its Zeppelin fund. Proposals to bomb Britain were first made by Paul Behncke, deputy chief of the German Naval Staff, in August 1914.Robinson 1971, p. 50 These were backed by Alfred von Tirpitz, who wrote that \\"The measure of the success will lie not only in the injury which will be caused to the enemy, but also in the significant effect it will have in diminishing the enemy's determination to prosecute the war\\".Robinson 1971, p. 54 The campaign was approved by the Kaiser on 7 January 1915, who at first forbade attacks on London, fearing that his relatives in the British royal family might be injured. Following an attempt on 13 January 1915 which was abandoned because of the weather, the first successful raid took place on the night of 19‚Äì20 January 1915. Two Zeppelins targeted Humberside but were diverted by strong winds, and dropped their bombs on Great Yarmouth, Sheringham, King's Lynn and the surrounding villages. Four people were killed and 16 injured. Monetary damage was estimated at ¬£7,740 (UK¬£ in ).Cole and Cheesman, 1984, p. 24 The raid prompted alarmist stories about German agents using car headlights to guide Zeppelins to their targets, and there was even a rumour that a Zeppelin was operating from a concealed base in the Lake District. An Imperial Order dated 12 February authorised the bombing of London's docks, which was interpreted by the German General Staff as permitting bombing targets east of Charing Cross.Robinson 1971 p. 67 This interpretation was formally accepted by the Kaiser on 5 May 1915.Robinson 1971 p. 69 The first Navy attempts to bomb London, made by L 8, failed owing to poor weather. The first was made on 26 February but turned back due to headwinds: a second attempt ended when the airship flew below the cloud base to check its position and found itself over Belgian army positions near Ostend: riddled by rifle fire, it came down near Tienen and was destroyed by the wind.Robinson 1971 p. 68 A four-airship raid by the Army on 17 March ran into fog and was abandoned, one airship bombing Calais and being damaged on landing. On 20 March the three remaining Army airships set off to bomb Paris; one was lost on the return journey. Two Navy raids failed due to bad weather on 14 and 15 April, and it was decided to delay further attempts until the more capable P-class Zeppelins were in service.Robinson 1971, p. 73 The Army received the first of these, LZ 38, and Erich Linnarz commanded it on a raid on Ipswich on 29‚Äì30 April and another on Southend on 9‚Äì10 May. LZ 38 also attacked Dover and Ramsgate on 16‚Äì17 May, before returning to bomb Southend on 26‚Äì27 May. These four raids killed six people and injured six, causing property damage estimated at ¬£16,898.Cole and Cheesman 1984, pp. 51‚Äì55. Twice Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) aircraft tried to intercept LZ 38 but on both occasions it was either able to outclimb the aircraft or was already at too great an altitude for the aircraft to intercept; the B.E.2 took about 50 minutes to climb to . On 30 May, Captain Linnarz again commanded LZ 38 on the first London raid; LZ 37 was also to be part of the raid but suffered structural damage early on and returned to Namur. Flying from Evere LZ 38 crossed the English coast near Margate at 21:42 before turning west over Southend. London police were warned of an incoming raid around 23:00; a few minutes later small incendiaries began to fall. These devices, weighing , were filled with thermite and the exterior was wrapped in tarred rope.Robinson 1971, p.4 In total some 120 bombs were dropped on a line stretching from Stoke Newington south to Stepney and then north toward Leytonstone. Seven people were killed and 35 injured; 41 fires were started, burning out seven properties and the total damage was assessed at ¬£18,596. Aware of the problems that the Germans were experiencing in navigation, this raid caused the government to issue a D notice prohibiting the press from reporting anything about future attacks that was not mentioned in official statements:Robinson 1971, p.74 previous press reports had contained detailed information about where bombs had fallen. Fifteen defensive sorties were flown against the raiders, only one of whom managed to make visual contact with the enemy. No ground-based guns fired and no searchlights found the airship; one pilot was killed when attempting to land.Cole and Cheesman, 1984, pp. 56‚Äì8 The naval airships also tried to raid London. On 4 June strong winds led the commander of L 10 to misjudge his position, and the bombs were dropped on Gravesend. L 9 was also diverted by the weather on 6‚Äì7 June, attacking Hull instead of London and causing considerable damage.Cole and Cheesman 1984, p.60 On the same night an Army raid of three Zeppelins also failed because of the weather; in an added blow, as the airship returned to Evere they ran into RNAS aircraft flying from Veurne, Belgium. LZ 38 was destroyed on the ground and LZ 37 was intercepted in the air by R. A. J. Warneford in a Morane Parasol, who dropped six Hales bombs on the Zeppelin, which caught fire and crashed into the convent school of Sint-Amandsberg. Two nuns were killed and all but one of the Zeppelin's crew also died. Warneford was awarded the Victoria Cross for his achievement. As a further consequence of the raid both the Army and Navy Zeppelins withdrew from their bases in Belgium:Robinson 1971, p. 77 their vulnerability was now clear. After an ineffective attack by L 10 on Tyneside on 15‚Äì16 June the short summer nights discouraged further raids for some months, and the remaining Army Zeppelins were reassigned to the Eastern and Balkan fronts. The Navy resumed raids on Britain in August. On 9‚Äì10 August, four Zeppelins were directed against London; none reached its target and one, L 12, was damaged by ground fire near Dover and came down in the sea off Zeebrugge. Despite eight attacks by RNAS aircraft the airship was towed into Ostend where it was later dismantled.Cole and Cheesman, pp. 64‚Äì7 The four- Zeppelin raid was repeated on 12‚Äì13 August; again only one airship, L 10, made landfall, dropping its bombs on Harwich.Cole and Cheesman. p. 67 A third four- Zeppelin raid tried to reach London on 17‚Äì18 August; two turned back with mechanical problems, one bombed Ashford, Kent in the belief it was Woolwich, but L 10 became the first Navy airship to reach London. L 10 was also misnavigated, mistaking the reservoirs of the Lea Valley for the Thames, and consequently dropped its bombs on Walthamstow and Leytonstone. 10 people were killed, 48 injured and property damage was estimated at ¬£30,750.Cole and Cheesman 1984, p. 68 Guns were fired at L 10 and a few aircraft took off in pursuit, but the Zeppelin suffered no damage. L 10 was destroyed a little over two weeks later: it was struck by lightning and caught fire off Cuxhaven, and the entire crew was killed.Robinson 1971, p. 384. British map plotting the raid of 7‚Äì8 September Two Army Zeppelins successfully bombed London on 7‚Äì8 September: SL 2 dropped bombs on the Isle of Dogs, Deptford, Greenwich and Woolwich, and LZ 74 was forced to drop weight on its approach and scattered 39 bombs over Cheshunt, before heading on to London and dropping bombs on Bermondsey, Rotherhithe and New Cross. Eighteen people were killed and 28 injured; property damage totalled ¬£9,616. Fog and mist prevented any aircraft taking off, but anti-aircraft guns fired at LZ 74 with no effect.Cole and Cheesman 1984, p. 69 Although these raids had no significant military impact, the psychological effect was considerable. The writer D.H. Lawrence described the raid in a letter to Lady Ottoline Morrell:Boulton, 2000, p. 106. The Navy attempted to follow up the Army's success the following night. Three Zeppelins were directed against London and one against the benzol plant at Skinningrove. L 11 turned back early with engine trouble; L 14 suffered the same problem while over Norfolk: its bombs were dropped on Dereham and the Zeppelin returned home. L 13 reached London, approaching over Golders Green, and Kapit√§nleutnant Heinrich Mathy began bombing around 22:40. The bomb-load included a device, the largest yet carried. This exploded on Bartholomew Close near Smithfield Market, destroying several houses and killing two men. Further bombs fell on the textile warehouses north of St Paul's Cathedral, causing a fire which despite the attendance of 22 fire engines caused over half a million pounds damage: Mathy then turned east, dropping his remaining bombs on Liverpool Street station. The Zeppelin was repeatedly caught by searchlights and all 26 anti-aircraft guns in London were active, but every shell exploded too low and the falling shrapnel caused both damage and alarm on the ground. Three aircraft were in the air. None even saw the Zeppelin; one crashed on landing, killing the pilot. The raid killed 22 people and injured 87:Cross 1991, p. 35. the monetary damage was over one sixth of the total damage inflicted by bombing raids during the war.Robinson 1971 p. 109 After three more raids were scattered by the weather a five-Zeppelin raid which became known as the \\"Theatreland Raid\\" was launched by the Navy on 13 October. Arriving over the Norfolk coast around 18:30 the Zeppelins encountered new ground defences installed since the September raid under the guidance of Sir Percy Scott. These new gun sites proved ineffective, although the airship commanders commented on the improved defences of the city.Robinson 1971, p. 117 A 13-pounder near Broxbourne was put out of action by three bombs dropped from L 15, which continued to London and began bombing over Charing Cross, the first bombs striking the Lyceum Theatre and the corner of Exeter and Wellington Streets, killing 17 and injuring 20. Further bombs were dropped on Holborn: as the airship neared Moorgate it was engaged by a new 75 mm gun sited at the Honourable Artillery Company grounds in Finsbury. L 15 quickly recognised this new threat and jettisoned ballast, dropped only three more bombs (one landing on Aldgate High Street causing much damage) before departing, having suffered some engine damage from the shells. L 13 dropped some bombs around Guildford and later others near Woolwich. L 14 dropped bombs on Otterpool Army Camp near Folkestone, killing 14 soldiers and injuring 12, and later bombed Tonbridge and East Croydon. Both the other Zeppelins, L 16 and L 11, were even further off course. L 16 dropped up to 50 bombs on Hertford and L 11 scattered a few bombs over Norfolk before heading home. In total, 71 people were killed and 128 injured.Cole and Cheesman 1984, p. 73 This was the last raid of 1915, as bad weather coincided with the new moon in both November and December 1915 and continued into January 1916. There were a total 20 raids in 1915, in which 37 tons of bombs were dropped, killing 181 people and injuring 455. =1916= Crater of a Zeppelin bomb in Paris In December 1915 additional P-class Zeppelins and the first of the new Q-class airships were delivered. The Q-class was an enlargement of the P-class, lengthened to , adding two gasbags, and improving both ceiling and bomb-load. Improved defensive measures made raids more hazardous, and several airships were destroyed. By mid-1916, there were 271 anti-aircraft guns and 258 searchlights across Britain, and the introduction of an effective combination of explosive and incendiary bullets gave the defending aircraft their first successes. New types of Zeppelin with improved ceilings restored the advantage, but led to further flying and navigation problems; oxygen was needed to fly at high altitude, the extreme cold led to crew fatigue and technical problems, and the meteorologists of the time did not appreciate the differing wind conditions likely to be met at altitude. Nevertheless, in 1916 twenty-three raids dropped 125 tons of bombs, killing 293 and injuring 691 people. Aerial defences against Zeppelins were haphazard, and divided between the RNAS and the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), with the Navy engaging enemy airships approaching the coast while the RFC took responsibility once the enemy had crossed the coastline. Initially the War Office believed that the Zeppelins used a layer of inert gas to protect themselves from incendiary bullets, and discouraged the use of such ammunition in favour of bombs. The initial trials of incendiary bullets in mid-1915 were unimpressive, and the explosive Pomeroy bullet attracted little official interest. However experiments undertaken in 1916 using a mixture of explosive and incendiary rounds were promising, and the use of this mixture of Pomeroy, Brock, and Buckingham bullets brought the defending aircraft their first victories, using the technique of firing machine guns upwards at 45 degrees into the airship. Ten home defence squadrons were organised by February 1916, with London's defences assigned to No. 19 RAS at Sutton's Farm and Hainault Farm (renamed No. 39 (Home Defence) Squadron in April 1916, who were also allocated North Weald Bassett airfield in August 1916). The number of aircraft varied: in February there were only eight squadrons at less than half-full strength, and by June the number of squadrons had been cut to six and only No. 39 Squadron was at full strength and equipped with the B.E.2c aircraft, which was being outclassed on the Western Front, but provided a stable gun platform suited to night fighting. Zeppelin flagstone, Edinburgh, Scotland Zeppelin bomb dropped on Edinburgh, displayed at the National Museum of Flight The first raid of 1916 was carried out by the German Navy. Nine Zeppelins were sent to Liverpool on the night of 31 January ‚Äì 1 February. A combination of poor weather, difficult navigation and mechanical problems scattered the aircraft across the Black Country hitting Tipton, Wednesbury and Walsall. A total of 61 people were reported killed and 101 injured by the raid.\\"Damage in the Raid.\\" The Times, 5 February 1916, p. 7. Fifteen of the fatalities occurred in the town of Tipton. L 21, captained by Max Dietrich, caused the majority of the damage. Despite ground fog, 22 aircraft took off to find the Zeppelins but none succeeded. Six aircraft were damaged beyond repair and two pilots were killed when attempting to land.Cole and Cheesman 1984, pp. 83‚Äì5. One airship, L 19, crashed in the North Sea because of engine failure and damage from Dutch ground‚Äìfire: all 16 crew were lost. Ordnance Survey map of Airship raid 31 March-1 April 1916 on England Further raids were delayed by an extended period of poor weather and also by the withdrawal of the majority of Naval Zeppelins in an attempt to identify and resolve the recurrent mechanical failures. Raids resumed in March: three Zeppelins set off to bomb Rosyth on 5‚Äì6 March but were forced by high winds to divert to Hull, killing 18, injuring 52 and causing ¬£25,005 damage.Cole and Cheeseman 1984, p. 110 On 30 March ‚Äì 1 April ten airships set off to bomb eastern England and London. Most turned back because of mechanical problems or the weather; L 15 was intercepted by Claude Ridley, who was unable to do more than fire a few rounds at extreme range; it was then damaged by anti-aircraft fire over Purfleet before being attacked by Alfred de Bathe Brandon using Ranken darts. It came down in the sea near Margate, all but one of the crew surviving. Most of the 48 killed in the raid were victims of a single bomb which fell on an Army billet in Cleethorpes.Cole and Cheeseman 1984, pp118-20 The following night two Navy Zeppelins, diverted from London by the weather, bombed targets in the north of England, killing 22 and injuring 130. On the night of 2‚Äì3 April a six-airship raid was made by Army and Navy airships, the Navy targeting the naval base at Rosyth and the Forth Bridge on the east coast of Scotland and the Army targeting London. None of the airships bombed their intended targets; 13 were killed, 24 injured and much of the ¬£77,113 damage was caused by the destruction of a warehouse in Leith containing whisky.Cole and Cheesman 1984 p. 122Robinson 1971 p. 137 A two-Zeppelin raid the following night was prevented from bombing London by the weather and caused no casualties or damage, and another against the north of England on the night of 5‚Äì6 April had little effect: one of the three raiders turned back with mechanical problems, and although the iron works at Skinningrove and a colliery near Bishop Auckland were bombed the casualties only amounted to one dead and nine injured.Cole and Cheesman 1984, p. 124 The wreckage of LZ 76 (L 33) On 28‚Äì29 July the first raid to include one of the new R-class Zeppelins, L 31, took place. These were long, with a capacity of , powered by six engines and capable of operating at , and could carry up to four tons of bombs. The 10-Zeppelin raid achieved very little; four turned back early and the rest wandered over a fog-shrouded landscape before giving up. Adverse weather dispersed two raids on 30‚Äì31 July and 2‚Äì3 August. On 8‚Äì9 August, two Zeppelins were part of a nine airship raid on Hull.Cole and Cheesman 1984, p. 145 The sixth successful London raid was on 24‚Äì25 August when 13 Navy Zeppelins were launched and Heinrich Mathy's L 31 reached London; flying above low clouds, 36 bombs were dropped in 10 minutes on West Ferry Road, Deptford Dry Dock, the station at Norway Street and homes in Greenwich, Eltham and Plumstead. Nine people were killed, 40 injured and ¬£130,203 of damage was caused. L 31 suffered no damage in the attack but several weeks of repair work were needed following a hard landing.Cole and Cheesman 1984, p.149 The biggest raid to date was launched on 2‚Äì3 September, with 12 German Navy airships and four from the German Army taking part. A combination of rain and snowstorms scattered the airships while they were still over the North Sea. None of the naval airships reached London, and only the army's LZ 98 and the newly commissioned Sch√ºtte-Lanz SL 11 achieved their objective. SL 11 came in over Foulness with the intention of attacking the capital from the northwest. It dropped a few bombs over London Colney and South Mimms before it was picked up by a searchlight over Hornsey at about 01:50 and subjected to an intense but ineffective barrage. It was lost in cloud over Wood Green but rediscovered by the searchlights at Waltham Abbey as it bombed Ponders End. At around 02:15 one of the three aircraft in the sky that night finally came into range, a B.E.2c piloted by Lt. William Leefe Robinson flying from Suttons Farm. Robinson fired three drums of ammunition from his Lewis gun, one on each of three passes. After he emptied the third drum, the airship began burning from the stern and was quickly enveloped in flames. It fell to the ground near Cuffley, witnessed by the crews of four of the naval Zeppelins. There were no survivors. For bringing down the first rigid airship downed on British soil and the first 'night fighter' victory Leefe Robinson received the Victoria Cross. The pieces of SL 11 were gathered up and sold by the Red Cross to raise money for wounded soldiers. The loss of SL 11 ended the German Army's interest in raids on Britain. The German Navy remained aggressive,Robinson 1971, p. 179 and a 12-Zeppelin raid was launched on 23‚Äì24 September. Eight older airships bombed targets in the Midlands and Northeast, while four M-class Zeppelins (L 30, L 31, L 32, and L 33) attacked London. L 30 did not even cross the coast, dropping its bombs at sea. L 31 approached London from the south, dropped a few bombs on Kenley and Mitcham and was picked up by searchlights. Forty-one bombs were then dropped in rapid succession over Streatham, killing seven and wounding 27. More bombs were dropped on Brixton before crossing the river and dropping 10 bombs on Leyton, killing another eight people and injuring 30. L 31 then headed home. Also coming in from the south was L 32, delayed by engine problems. It dropped a few bombs on Sevenoaks and Swanley before crossing Purfleet at about 01:00. The Zeppelin then came under anti-aircraft fire as it dropped bombs on Aveley and South Ockendon. Shortly thereafter, at 01:10, a B.E.2c piloted by 2nd Lieutenant Frederick Sowrey engaged L 32\\\\. He fired three drums of incendiaries and succeeded in starting a fire which quickly spread. The Zeppelin came down at Snail's Hall Farm, Great Burstead. The entire crew was killed, with some, including the commander Oberleutnant-zur- See Werner Peterson, choosing to jump rather than burn to death. L 33 dropped a few incendiaries over Upminster before losing its way and making several turns, heading over London and dropping bombs on Bromley at around midnight. As the bombs began to explode, the Zeppelin was hit by an anti-aircraft shell fired from the guns at either Beckton, Wanstead, or Victoria Park despite being at . Dropping bombs now to shed weight, a large number fell on homes in Botolph Road and Bow Road. As the airship headed towards Chelmsford it continued to lose height, coming under fire at Kelvedon Hatch and briefly exchanging fire with a B.E.2c. Despite the efforts of the crew, L 33 was forced to the ground at around 01:15 in a field close to New Hall Cottages, Little Wigborough. The airship was set alight and the crew headed south before being arrested at Peldon by the police. Inspection of the wreckage provided the British with much information about the construction of Zeppelins, which was used in the design of the British R33-class airships. One engine recovered from the wreck was subsequently substituted for two (of four) engines on a Vickers-built machine, the hitherto underpowered R.9. British propaganda postcard, entitled \\"The End of the 'Baby-Killer'\\" The next raid came on 1 October 1916. Eleven Zeppelins were launched at targets in the Midlands and at London. As usual weather played a major role and only L 31 under the experienced Heinrich Mathy, on his 15th raid, reached London. Approaching from Suffolk, L 31 was picked up by the searchlights at Kelvedon Hatch around 21:45; turning away, the airship detoured over Harlow, Stevenage and Hatfield. As the airship neared Cheshunt at about 23:20 it was quickly picked up by six searchlights. Three aircraft of No. 39 Squadron were in the air and closed in. A B.E.2c piloted by 2nd Lieutenant Wulstan Tempest engaged the Zeppelin at around 23:50; three bursts were sufficient to set fire to L 31, and it crashed near Potters Bar with all 19 crew dying, Mathy jumping from the burning airship. His body was found near the wreckage, embedded some four inches in the ground. Tempest had had to dive out of the way of the stricken airship and, possibly suffering from anoxia, crashed without injury on landing.Cole and Cheesman, pp. 174‚Äì6 A raid on 27‚Äì28 November avoided London, instead targeting the Midlands and Tyneside. Nine Navy airships took part. The bombing was largely ineffective, killing four, injuring 37 and causing ¬£12,482 damage. Two airships were shot down by the defending aircraft: L 34 was brought down in flames off the coast at Hartlepool by 2nd Lt. Ian Pyott flying a B.E.2c and L 21 was attacked by three aircraft near Yarmouth: Flt Sub-Lt. Edward Pulling was credited with the victory and awarded a DSO, the other pilots receiving the DFC.Cole and Cheesman 1984 pp. 178‚Äì183 The following day a single LVG CIV made the first German aeroplane raid on London: hoping to hit the Admiralty, six 10 kg (22 lb) bombs fell between Victoria station and the Brompton Road.Cole and Cheesman 1984, p. 184-5 There were no further raids in 1916 although the Navy lost three more craft, all on 28 December: SL 12 was destroyed at Ahlhorn by strong winds after sustaining damage in a poor landing, and at T√∏nder L 24 crashed into the shed while landing: the resulting fire destroyed both L 24 and the adjacent L 17\\\\. =1917= Contemporary illustration of a Gotha crew in action The losses during 1916 caused the Germans to increase the ceiling of their airships. This was first achieved by lightening the existing craft, principally by removing one of the engines. This increased the ceiling to over . Meanwhile, new types with a lightened hull framework were developed.Robinson 1971 pp. 204‚Äì9 In late 1916 Germany had begun planning a daylight bombing offensive against Britain using aeroplanes, called Operation T√ºrkenkreuz' (Turk's Cross). In anticipation of the campaign, Kampfgeschwader der Obersten Heeresleitung 3 (Kagohl 3), nicknamed the \\"England Geschwader\\", was formed, consisting of six Kampfstaffel (Kastas) under the command of Hauptmann Ernst Brandenburg.Fredette 1976, pp. 37‚Äì39. Kagohl 3 initially operated from Sint-Denijs-Westrem and Gontrode in the Ghent area of German-occupied Belgium. The first raid of 1917 took place on 16‚Äì17 March: five high-altitude Zeppelins encountered very strong winds, and none reached their targets.Cole and Cheesman 1984, p. 198. On the return flight L 39 suffered an engine failure and, blown over French-held territory, was brought down in flames by ground fire. The lack of success was repeated on 23‚Äì24 May, when six Zeppelins set out to bomb London but were frustrated by a combination of high winds and thick cloud. A few bombs were dropped on Suffolk, killing one person and causing ¬£599 damage.Cole and Cheesman pp. 201‚Äì5 Daylight Gotha raids Gotha G.IV in flight Kagohl 3 received the first Gotha G.IV aircraft in March, and on 25 May, the squadron commenced Operation Turkenkreuz, sending 23 Gothas to bomb London. Two were forced to turn back over the North Sea due to mechanical difficulties and cloud over London caused the remaining bombers to divert to secondary targets at the Channel port of Folkestone and the nearby Shorncliffe Army Camp. The raid resulted in 95 deaths and 195 injuries, mostly in Folkestone. In Shorncliffe, 18 soldiers (16 Canadian and two British) were killed and 90 were wounded. Nine Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) Sopwith Pups engaged the bombers near the Belgian coast as they returned, shooting one down.Cole and Cheesman 1984, pp. 237‚Äì238. A second attack on 5 June was diverted to Sheerness in Kent but a third raid on 13 June, was the first daylight raid on London, causing 162 deaths and 432 injuries. Among the dead were 18 children, killed by a bomb falling on the Upper North Street School primary school in Poplar.The First Blitz Andrew P Hyde p184Cole and Cheesman 1984, pp243‚Äì6 This was the deadliest air raid of the war and no Gothas were lost. In 1938, Air Commodore Lionel Charlton described the raid as \\"the beginning of a new epoch in the history of warfare\\".Charlton, Lionel. The Air Defence of Britain. London: Penguin Books, 1938 News of the raid was received enthusiastically in Germany and Brandenburg was summoned to Berlin to be awarded the Pour le M√©rite, Germany's highest military honour. On taking off for the return journey, the engine of his aircraft failed, Brandenburg was severely injured and his pilot, Oberleutnant Freiherr von Trotha, was killed.Fredette 1974, pp. 60‚Äì61 The reason for the relatively large numbers of casualties seems to have been ignorance as to the threat posed by aerial bombardment of a city in daylight. Lt. Charles Chabot, a Royal Flying Corps (RFC) pilot on leave recorded that: \\"...Raids hadn't become a very serious thing and everybody crowded out into the street to watch. They didn't take cover or dodge\\". A variety of the bombs used by the Germans As there had been little planning, early attempts to intercept the Gothas were ineffective. Large numbers of British aircraft were put into the air but were unable to climb high enough to engage the bombers. Captain James McCudden was part of the engaging force of 92 aircraft but due to the limited performance of his machine, had no success in intercepting the bombers. On 16‚Äì17 June, an attempted raid by six Zeppelins was met with some success; two airships were unable to leave their shed due to high winds and two more turned back with engine problems. Of the two that reached England, L 42 hit a naval ammunition store in Ramsgate, while L 48, the first U-class Zeppelin, was intercepted near Harwich and attacked by a DH.2 flown by Captain Robert Saundby, a F.E. 2b flown by Lt F. D. Holder and Sgt S. Ashby, and a B.E.12 flown by Pierce Watkins. The Zeppelin came down in flames near Theberton in Suffolk: Watkins was officially credited with the victory.Cole and Cheesman, p.p.250‚Äì4 A further Gotha raid of 22 aircraft was made on 7 July, resulting in 57 deaths and 193 injuries on the ground.Cole and Cheesman p. 260 One hundred sorties were flown against the formation, resulting in one Gotha shot down, three damaged and two fighters shot down. Felixstowe and Harwich were bombed on 22 July and Southend and Shoeburyness on 12 August, with the loss of one Gotha, four others crashing on landing.Fredette 1974, p. 263 On 18 August, the largest raid of the war was attempted, despite a warning of unfavourable weather. Twenty-eight aircraft took off and soon encountered the predicted high winds, after nearly two hours in the air they had made so little progress that Zeebrugge was still in sight. After a further hour the English coast came into sight, revealing that the Gothas were some off course. With barely enough fuel left to return to Belgium, the flight commander called off the attack. The high wind caused two aircraft to come down in the North Sea and others ran out of fuel and were lost making forced landings, two coming down in neutral Holland.Fredette 1974, pp.103‚Äì6 On 22 August 15 aircraft set out to attack Margate and Dover. Five turned back over the North Sea and the rest were met by heavy anti-aircraft fire and fighter aircraft over the Isle of Thanet. Two Gothas were shot down almost immediately and a third was shot down over Dover.Fredette 1974, pp. 107‚Äì8 Night raids Members of Kagohl 3 in front of a Gotha, 1917 The improved British air defences forced Kagohl 3 to abandon daylight raids. While night raids provided a measure of protection from interceptors and anti-aircraft fire, they greatly complicated navigation and landing. Many damaged aircraft limped back to their airfields only to be lost in landing accidents. The first night raid by the Gothas took place on 3 September against Chatham, as an experiment by five aircraft. The 152 deaths included 130 naval recruits whose dormitory was hit, the worst bombing incident of the war.Cole and Cheesman, p. 302 Encouraged by the lack of night defences, a raid on London was carried out the following night. Of the eleven aircraft which set out, nine reached England and five got as far as London; 18 defensive sorties were flown but none made contact. The defensive flights were significant in that the aircraft used included Sopwith Camels, proving that it was practical to fly the type at night. One Gotha failed to return, probably shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Fort Borstal near Rochester.Cole and Cheesman, p.323 Six raids followed at the end of September. These included the first raids on England by the enormous Zeppelin-Staaken Riesenflugzeug of Riesenflugzeug-Abteilung 501. On 24 September 16 Gothas set off and 13 reached England, most bombing Dover and other targets in Kent, with only five reaching London. This coincided with an unsuccessful Zeppelin attack on the Midlands.Cole and Cheesman, pp. 325‚Äì7 The following night 15 Gothas set out, with similar results, only three aircraft reaching London. One of the bombers came down in the North Sea, probably the victim of a Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter flown by Douglas Bell and George Williams of 78 Squadron.Cole and Cheesman pp. 332‚Äì3 On 28 September 25 Gothas and two Riesenflugzeuge took off but most turned back due to adverse weather. Three people were wounded and ¬£129 damage was caused, for the cost of three Gothas lost and six damaged on landing.Fredette 1974, p. 264 The following night seven Gothas and three Riesenflugzeuge took off, killing 40 and injuring 87 for the loss of one aircraft. By this time the population of London was thoroughly alarmed, with up to 300,000 people seeking shelter in Underground stations and others leaving London to sleep in whatever accommodation was available, some in fields.Fredette 1974, pp.143‚Äì4 On 30 September 11 Gothas set off to raid London and on 1 October 18 took off, eleven reaching England. Over 14,000 rounds were fired by British anti- aircraft guns without scoring a hit.Fredette 1974, p.135 By now shells were in short supply and many of the guns had fired so many rounds that their barrels were worn out. The Government reallocated new 3-inch (76.2 mm) guns from arming merchant ships against submarines, to the defence of London. The barrage was also proving hazardous to those on the ground, in that week eight people had been killed and another 67 injured by falling fragments.Fredette 1974, p.146‚Äì7 The RNAS and RFC carried out bombing raids on German bomber airfields at St. Denis-Westrem and Gontrode, forcing the squadrons to relocate to Mariakerke and Oostakker, with the staff headquarters moving to Ghent.Fredette 1974, p. 149‚Äì50 The next raid against England was carried out on 29 October, when three aircraft set out, two diverting to Calais because of the weather and the third dropping its bombs on the Essex coast. The following night a big raid was mounted, the bomb load including large numbers of a newly developed incendiary bomb. 22 Gothas took off, of which over half released their bombs over Kent, with little effect other than the destruction of a gasometer in Ramsgate. Bombs were dropped on the eastern suburbs of London but many of the incendiaries failed to ignite and five aircraft crashed when attempting to land.Fredette 1974, pp.162‚Äì6 Poor weather prevented raids in November and the Gotha crews occupied themselves with training flights. To lessen the chance of a raid meeting adverse weather, in December the Germans began to send out a radio-equipped Rumpler C.IV to make weather observations off the English coast.Fredette 1974, p.166 The weather cleared on 5 December, when 19 Gothas and two Riesenflugzeuge attacked in waves. Casualties were light but over ¬£100,000 of damage was caused, mostly in London. Two Gothas were brought down by anti-aircraft fire and one with an engine disabled, attempted a landing at Rochford aerodrome, struck a tree on approach and crashed. The second aircraft came down near Canterbury and in both cases all the crew survived but a third aircraft and crew was reported missing.Cole and Cheesman, pp. 355‚Äì7 =1918= On 28 January 13 Gothas and two Giants set off, six of the Gothas turning back because of poor visibility. Over a hundred defensive sorties were flown, resulting in one Gotha being shot down after being attacked by two Sopwith Camels from the 40 Squadron RFC, flown by Second Lieutenants Charles Banks and George Hackwill, the first victory for night fighters against a heavier-than-air bomber over Britain; both pilots were awarded the DFC.Cole and Cheesman 1984, pp 385‚Äì8 On the ground, 67 people were killed and 166 injured: the casualties included 14 dead and 14 injured in stampedes, when people queuing for admission to shelters were alarmed by maroons set off as a warning that a raid was expected; another 11 were injured by shrapnel from anti-aircraft fire. Many of the other casualties were caused by a bomb, which fell on the Odhams printing works in Long Acre, which was being used as a shelter.Fredette 1974 pp181‚Äì2 The following night, the first raid undertaken by Giants unaccompanied by Gothas took place. Four aircraft from Rfa 501 took off, one turning back before reaching England and casualties and damage were light. Eighty defensive sorties were flown and one Giant was attacked by five aircraft, one attack succeeding in disabling an engine.Cole and Cheesman, pp. 390‚Äì3 British fighter pilots' efforts against the Giants were handicapped by poor intelligence work, although the existence of these aircraft was known, the information had not been passed on, and many pilots may have underestimated the range from which they were firing. Rfa 501 attacked by itself again on 16 February, four aircraft reached England, one carrying a bomb which, aimed at Victoria station, fell half a mile away on the Royal Hospital, Chelsea.Fredette 1974, p.188 An aircraft attacked the following night, hitting St. Pancras station; 21 people were killed and 32 injured.Cole and Cheesman, pp400‚Äì1 Another Giant raid took place on 7 March: five aircraft reached England, one carrying another bomb, which fell on Warrington Crescent near Paddington station: among the dead was Lena Ford, who had written the lyrics of the popular wartime song Keep the Home Fires Burning.Fredette 1974, pp. 192‚Äì3 On 12 March, five Zeppelins attempted a raid on the Midlands: headwinds caused them to mistake their position and two dropped their bombs in the sea, the rest bombing the Hull area with little effect, their commanders thinking that they were over Leeds. Another raid was attempted the following night but only one of the three airships reached England, bombing Hartlepool. The bombs killed eight people and an RFC pilot was killed when he flew into Pontop Pike near Dipton, County Durham.Cole and Cheesman 1984, pp. 407‚Äì10 A third airship raid took place on 12 April: again the altitude and weather caused navigational problems and although attacks were claimed on a number of towns in the Midlands, most of the bombs fell in open countryside. Seven people were killed, 20 injured and ¬£11,673 damage was caused.Cole and Cheesman 1984, pp410‚Äì1 By the middle of March, the Gotha squadron was once again ready to attack England but had to support the Spring Offensive which started on 21 March, being used to bomb Calais, Dunkirk, Boulogne and troop concentrations and railways.Fredette 1974, p. 194 On 9 May, Rfa 501 suffered a catastrophic blow when four aircraft attempted to bomb Dover. High winds caused them to be recalled when over the Channel, by which time fog had covered their base. One aircraft landed safely, the crew of a second survived a crash in which the aircraft was damaged beyond repair and the remaining two crashed with the loss of all but one member of each crew.Fredette 1974, p. 196 The last and largest aeroplane raid of the war took place on the night of 19 May 1918, when 38 Gothas and 3 Giants took off against London. Six Gothas were shot down by interceptors and anti-aircraft fire and a seventh aircraft was forced to land after a protracted close quarters engagement with a Bristol fighter of 141 Squadron from Biggin Hill, crewed by Lieutenants Edward Eric Turner and Henry Balfour Barwise. This was the first victory of the war for Biggin Hill,Ashmore, Edward B., Air Defense, (London: Longmans, Green, 1929) for which Turner and Barwise were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. The British estimated that of bombs were dropped, although the German figure was . 49 people were killed, 177 injured and damage was ¬£117,317.Cole and Cheesman 1984, pp.423‚Äì6 After this raid, both Kagohl 3 and Rfa 501 were principally used for army support. The development of the B-1E \\"Elektron\\" incendiary bomb, led to a project, Der Feuerplan (The Fire Plan), which involved the use of the whole German heavy bomber fleet, flying in waves over London and Paris and dropping all the incendiaries that they could carry, until they were either all shot down or the crews were too exhausted to fly. The hope was that the two capitals would be destroyed in an inextinguishable blaze, causing the Allies to sue for peace.Hanson, pp. 413‚Äì414 Thousands of Elektron bombs were delivered to forward bomber bases and the operation was scheduled for August and again in early September 1918 but on both occasions, the order to take off was countermanded at the last moment, perhaps because of the fear of Allied reprisals.Cole and Cheesman 1984, p. 416Hanson, pp. 437‚Äì438 The last Zeppelin raid on Britain took place on 5 August 1918, when four Zeppelins bombed targets in the Midlands and the North of England. The airships reached the British coast before dark and were sighted by the Leman Tail lightship north-east of Happisburgh at 20:10, although defending aircraft were not alerted until 20:50. Despite thick cloud two aircraft intercepted the recently commissioned L 70, which was carrying Peter Strasser, F√ºhrer der Luftschiffe of the German Imperial Navy, as an observer. The Zeppelin was shot down in flames with no survivors. Egbert Cadbury and Robert Leckie flying a DH.4 were credited with the victory.Cole and Cheesman 1984, p.440 The remaining airships dropped their bombs blind, relying on radio bearings for navigational information and none fell on land. An attempt was made to salvage the wreckage of L 70 and most of the structure was brought ashore, providing the British a great deal of technical information. The bodies of the crew members were buried at sea.Robinson 1971,pp335‚Äì6 Notes Citations References * Cole, Christopher and Cheesman, E. F. The Air Defence of Great Britain 1914‚Äì1918.

Often this language is also the dominant, or superstrate language, though this is not always the case, as can be seen in the historical Mediterranean Lingua Franca. In mixed languages, there are no superstrates or substrates, but instead two or more adstrates. One adstrate still contributes the majority of the lexicon in most cases, and would be considered the lexifier. However, it is not the dominant language, as there are none in the development of mixed languages, such as in Michif.  Structure  Pidgin and creole language names are often written as the following: Location spoken + Stage of Development + Lexifier language. For example: Malaysian Creole Portuguese, with Portuguese being the lexifier and the superstrate language at the time of the creole development. Often the autoglossonym, or the name the speakers give their contact language, is written Broken + Lexifier, e.g. Broken English. This becomes confusing when multiple contact languages have the same lexifier, as different languages could be called the same name by their speakers. Hence, the names are as stated above in the literature to reduce this confusion.  Name  The word lexifier is derived from the modern Latin word lexicon, meaning a catalogue of the vocabulary or units in a given language.

He was of Greek origin, but born in Palermo, and had an educated background, for he was \\"most learned in Greek and Arabic, and not unskilled in Latin.\\"Houben, 99, quoting an anonymous Latin translator of Ptolemy's Almagest. By the time of his admiralcy, the educated, multilingual Greek or Arab administrator was becoming rare in Sicily. Eugenius' family had been important in the Hauteville administration for generations before him. He was a son of Admiral John and grandson of another Admiral Eugenius.Houben, p.150. He served under William II before being raised to the rank of admiral in 1190.Norwich, 406. His first duties were as an officer of the diwan (Latinised duana or dohana). He bore the title magister duane baronumEnglish: master of the baronial diwan. The Latin title also appears as magister regie dohane baronum in later charters. in September 1174, when he was sent by the king to Salerno to check the accounts of the bailiffs and to authorise the sale of property on behalf of the stratigotus, so he could pay off a loan.Matthew, 225. Though his official duties as magister are unknown, he was also in charge of publishing and disseminating a signaculum of William's whereby all tolls at bridges, roadways, and riverways in the royal demesne were lifted (April 1187).Matthew, 226. Eugenius determined the boundaries of the lands of the church of Santa Sofia of Benevento in 1175 and he arbitrated a boundary dispute between Ravello and Amalfi at Nocera in 1178 and at Minori later that year in September. There he was styled magister regie dohane baronum et de secretis. At this time, he appears to have worked under Walter de Moac. He loyally served Tancred before transitioning to a role in the Hohenstaufen government of Constance and the Emperor Henry VI. He was falsely accused of conspiring against Henry and was briefly held captive in Germany. Eugenius was an accomplished translator and poet and has even been suggested as the person behind the nom de plume \\"Hugo Falcandus\\", a chronicler who wrote a record of events at Palermo from 1154 to 1169. Eugenius was certainly well-placed for such a chronicle. Around 1154, he made a translation from Arabic to Latin of Ptolemy's Optics, which survives in twenty manuscripts.Matthew, 118. He also translated the Sibylline Erythraeon from Greek into Latin, but the only manuscripts of this which survive are thirteenth-century copies based on the prophecies of Joachim of Fiore.Matthew, 115. He wrote Greek poetry, of which twenty-four verses survive in a fourteenth-century manuscript. They were of mediocre quality and written in the style then prevalent at Constantinople.Matthew, 119. The poems give insight to his life and times: he was an intimate of King William I and an associate of the Greek religious communities in Brindisi and Messina. He wrote one poem lamenting his imprisonment (in Germany), blaming it on the evil state of the world, but taking a philosophical approach to his troubles.

The band were originally based in their hometown of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, and were based around the nucleus of Linger and Jacobs who continued the band with a number of diffent bass players. Career Neils Children formed in 1999 at Harlow College where John Linger and Brandon Jacobs were studying music with Tom Hawkins. The band's name came from Linger's obsession with 1960s proto-punk band John's Children; 'Neil' was the nickname of Hawkins, the group's original bassist, due to him apparently resembling Men Behaving Badly star Neil Morrissey. Primarily playing freakbeat-inspired music, the band performed several gigs on the London mod scene, as well as performing in the Harlow Square Rock Contest. In 2000 Hawkins quit the band and went on to become a sound engineer for The Subways. Replacement bassist James Hair was recruited in early 2001. They are seen as forerunners of the mid 2000s 'Southend Scene' which revolved around Junk Club, a club night set up by future Horrors member Rhys Webb, Oliver Abbott, Ciaran O'Shea and John Linger and was considered the most unusual and cutting edge alternative club in the town. Adopted as honorary 'Southenders', Neils Children acted as house band for Junk Club, playing handfuls of shows either as one-off concerts or dates on longer UK tours. The 'Southend Scene' was written about in the pages of NME magazine, the focus of which went on to spawn such groups as The Horrors and These New Puritans, and it has long been noted that Neils Children acted as a catalyst for the scene and the bands involved. They played many concerts in London, Southend, Brighton and other cities, notably playing the Insomniacs Ball in London in 2006, and the London Calling Festival in Amsterdam. John was placed Number 30 of 50 in NME's Cool List in 2005. In June 2005, their single \\"Always the Same\\" peaked at No. 56 in the UK Singles Chart. The group were much in demand as a support act for up and coming UK bands, being invited to support rising British bands such as Razorlight, Bloc Party, The Horrors, Klaxons and Art Brut on tour as well as completing various British headline tours and shows throughout the UK and Europe. In December 2005, Hair left to form Vile Imbeciles with former The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster member Andy Huxley and moved to Brighton, and was replaced by Keith Seymour (formerly of Hope of the States). Bassist Keith Seymour joined the band in 2005 and in 2007, the band received attention in the wake of the critical and commercial success of close long-term friends The Horrors, with whom they toured in April. This line-up recorded and released the most prolific amount of material in the band's catalogue, including the unreleased full-length album Pop/Aural and the band's 2009 album X.Enc. Two Japanese tours were completed alongside European and British dates. In July 2009, Seymour left the group for personal reasons. On 10 September 2009, Neils Children played their debut live show as a short-lived four-piece band, composed of Linger and Jacobs, with Charlie Boyer (bass) and Paul Linger (percussion, samples) of Electricity In Our Homes. The set consisted of five tracks taken from the X.Enc album release and \\"Front on Backwards\\", a song written by Linger on the band's summer 2008 Japanese tour. In August 2010, founder members Linger and Jacobs announced the split of the group, planning the band's last show at 2010's Offset Festival. Originally planned as Linger's solo performance, the duo played a couple of unique arrangements of Neils Children songs, using the second half of the show to showcase their new group, The Drop Five. In late 2012 Neils Children founder members John and Brandon announced that the band would return from hiatus to record a new full-length album Dimly Lit, their first in over four years. Since the album's release, the band have also released a non-album single entitled \\"The Highs and Lows\\", as well as the library/soundtrack-music-themed cassette-only release Serial Music #1. The group are currently working on material to follow up 2013's Dimly Lit. Other work Various members of the band have undertaken side projects. Linger, under the pseudonym of \\"Round\\", was the first member of Neils Children to pursue solo work and recorded in 2007 a few tracks which were posted on MySpace. He performed a solo show at the Experimental Circle Club in Southend. Jacobs performs under the name of Goodnight And I Wish*, and has recorded a number of releases. Linger is also active as a mix engineer and record producer for various projects. He produced the early discography of the London band, Electricity In Our Homes (which features his brother Paul on drums); 2007's The Shareholders Meeting EP and the 2008 singles \\"We Thought It Was, But It Wasn't\\" (Too Pure) and \\"Silver Medal In Gymnastics\\" (4AD). Most recently he produced and mixed two tracks planned for a single release by the Chichester based post-punk band, Disconcerts. Currently he is mixing Moscow- based band Manicure's new album, scheduled for release in April/May 2011. Record labels overseen by band members included Jacob's label Modern Pop, which has released work by Electricity In Our Homes, and Strange Idols; and the Structurally Sound label, founded by the band in 2008 to release their own music and that of associated acts. Linger now also plays bass in the current Neils Children bassist Syd Kemp's band (also called Syd Kemp) with former Dark Horses bassist Harry Bohay on drums.

Community & Service  The range of services is very limited in M√∂lnbo. The proximity to Gnesta and S√∂dert√§lje, as well as the relative proximity to Stockholm is a contributing factor to the limited range of services. Stores tend to open in larger cities instead. Some major chains of stores, for example Konsum (nowadays COOP) have tried to open grocery stores in M√∂lnbo, but failed to keep open due to the limited population. Today, there is one store in M√∂lnbo, and it is combined with a pizzeria, owned by the local celebrity Abbe. The store is called \\"Abbes Livs\\" and the pizzeria is called \\"Abbes Pizzeria\\". M√∂lnbo's greatest era was during the 19th century when the Swedish king had one of his stables close to the village. Celebrities from M√∂lnbo are the musicians who created the band Fresh 'n' Funky. M√∂lnbo has a rich variety of different associations like M√∂lnbo IF (a football club) and M√∂lnbo GF (gymnastics). There are a few municipal services in M√∂lnbo, one of them being a small library.  M√∂lnbo filmfestival (M√∂lnbo film festival)  M√∂lnbo filmfestival is held annually in M√∂lnbo Bio (M√∂lnbo cinema). The festival was highly appreciated, and was a pleasure, not only for the citizens in M√∂lnbo ‚Äì but also for other people as well. After three successful festivals, there has been a break for some years, however M√∂lnbo Bio is still alive, and shows a new movie every Sunday. The cinema is located in the oldest, and nowadays only, Folkets Hus in S√∂dert√§lje. Those who built the house was a group of radical agricultural labourers and workers at the nearby sawmill and at the marble quarry. This contributed to close relationships with the growing central labour movement. In M√∂lnbo Folkets Hus, Keve Hjelm had his first musical performance. Other famous citizens from V√•rdinge who have performed in M√∂lnbo Folkets Hus are Tora Dahl and Harry Martinsson.  Public transport  M√∂lnbo is served by Stockholm commuter rail, the Gnesta‚ÄìS√∂dert√§lje Centrum line. Change to long distance trains can be done at S√∂dert√§lje Syd.

The aircraft was a private venture development and based on the Westland Wapiti. It never entered production. The aircraft is best known as one of the first two to fly over Everest as part of the Houston-Mount Everest Flight Expedition. History The PV-3 design was produced in 1930 as a private venture two-seat aircraft that could be used as either a carrier-based torpedo bomber intended to carry a new lightweight torpedo being developed by the Admiralty, or as an army-co-operation aircraft.Mason 1994, p.221. As such, it was a development of the Wapiti, with an all-metal structure and folding two-bay wings. It was powered by a 575 hp (429 kW) Bristol Jupiter XFA radial engine, having a defensive armament of one forward-firing Vickers machine gun and a Lewis gun on a Scarff ring on the observer's cockpit. It could carry either the planned 1,000 lb (455 kg) torpedo under the fuselage or an equivalent weight of bombs under the wings.James 1991, pp.195‚Äì197. It first flew in February 1931, showing good performance (in particular, a high ceiling) and handling when tested by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Martlesham Heath. Despite this, no orders resulted, and the lightweight torpedo was cancelled.James 1991, p.197. In November 1932, the PV-3 was chosen, together with the Westland PV-6 (the prototype of the Westland Wallace) for the Houston Mount Everest Flying Expedition to fly over and photograph Mount Everest. The aircraft, now registered G-ACAZ, was remodelled with a rear cabin and a 630 hp Bristol Pegasus engine driving a large diameter propeller.James 1991, p.198. It was test flown from Yeovil in the new configuration, and on 25 January 1933 reached a height of 35,000 ft.James 1991, p.200. Flown by Lord Clydesdale with Stewart Blacker as observer and photographer, it was accompanied by the Wallace as, on 3 April 1933, the two aircraft became the first to fly over Mount Everest, flying over Kangchenjunga on 4 April and making a second flight over Everest (as the initial flight had produced inadequate photographs for map-making) on 19 April 1933.James 2008, pp24-25. The PV-3 was later exhibited at Selfridges department store in London in July 1933. In December 1933 the aircraft, given the military serial K4048, was issued to Bristol Aircraft as an engine testbed.Jackson 1988, p.365. The aircraft is also referred to as the Houston-Westland in honour of Lady Houston who had financed the 1933 expedition.

The story begins in medias res: the eponymous Lucy has come from the West Indies to the United States to be an au pair for a wealthy white family. The plot of the novel closely mirrors Kincaid's own experiences. Lucy retains the critical tone of A Small Place but simplifies the style of Kincaid's earlier work by using less repetition and surrealism. The first of her books set completely outside the Caribbean, Lucy, like most of Kincaid's writing, has a strong autobiographical basis. The novel's protagonist, Lucy Josephine Potter, shares one of Kincaid's given names and her birthday. Like Kincaid, Lucy leaves the Caribbean to become an au pair in a large American city. At nineteen, Lucy is older than previous Kincaid protagonists, which lends the book a more mature and cynical perspective than in her previous fiction. Still, Lucy has pangs of homesickness and unresolved feelings about her mother, and she has never lived on her own or seen much of the world. With plenty of room for growth and Lucy becoming a photographer, the story takes the form of a k√ºnstlerroman, a novel in which an artist matures. Lucy also joins the tradition of American immigration literature, tales that recount a newcomer's experience in the United States, such as those seen in Anzia Yezierska‚Äôs Bread Givers, Willa Cather‚Äôs My Antonia, and Julia Alvarez‚Äôs How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents. Along with exploring immigration, Lucy, as does much of Kincaid's work, grapples with tensions between mother and daughter. Colonial themes of identity confusion and the connection between maternal and imperial rule stand out less clearly in Lucy than in Kincaid's earlier books but have an underlying presence in Lucy's relationship with her white, affluent employers, her homeland, and her new surroundings. Plot summary Eager to leave the West Indies, Lucy longs to leave her past behind. She does not feel nostalgic for her childhood and her homeland, where she felt oppressed by toxic colonial and family influences. However, on her arrival to North America, she reflects on the differences between the place that she had previously called home and where she now lives. She feels as if something is wrong because the sun is shining but the air is still cold. Additionally, she recalls fond memories of her grandmother along with her favorite foods from home that her grandmother would cook for her, both of which are no longer available to her. She moves to America to work as an au pair for a well-off family. Although she is initially enamored with their seemingly perfect life, she grows disillusioned with their lifestyle and feels alienated from the family. Despite this, she does grow close to the mother, Mariah, who reminds Lucy of both the good and bad in her own mother. The relationship between Lucy and her mother is a central theme. At one point in her relationship with Mariah, Lucy sees Mariah (her boss) and her mother as the same, because they both try to control Lucy. (At other times, Lucy feels like Mariah's friend.) Lucy also sees a resemblance when she sees Lewis, Mariah's husband, cheats on Mariah, because Lucy's own father cheated on her mother. Throughout the book, Lucy's strained relationship with her mother drives her quest for independence and ability to create her own identity against that of her mother's. Lucy's mother was committed to her father, who had children by multiple other women. Angry that her mother valued proper, committed relationships (and taught Lucy to behave the same way) and still ended up hurt, Lucy attempts to identify herself against her mother through her multiple sexual encounters devoid of emotional attachment. This novel explores Lucy's sexuality as part of her identity search, illustrated through her various sexual encounters with men as well as her homoerotic relationship with her friend Peggy, whom Mariah dislikes for being a bad influence. Lucy's father is not referred to as much as her mother is spoken about, so it is unclear what kind of relationship they have or if she feels as negatively towards him as she does towards her mother. Lucy's father was an older man when he married her mother, and she describes their arrangement as mutually beneficial. Her mother married someone who would not bother her too much, while she was still able to maintain appearances. Likewise, her father in his old age married someone in order to take care of him. Her father had several love affairs and children with other women before he married her mother. Some of these women tried to cause harm to both Lucy and her mother throughout their lives. Lucy's father was raised by his grandmother. His mother left him at the age of five and then at the age of seven his father left to work on the Panama Canal, and he never saw either of them again. His grandmother then died in the middle of the night one night and did not wake up the next morning. Lucy's mother writes her many letters while she works as an au pair, but, feeling betrayed by her mother for funding her half-siblings' education over hers, she refuses to open them. When she receives notice that her father died, she hastily sends her mother money, along with a letter cutting off all communication from her. Further fueling her desire to move away from the disenchanting life of Mariah's family, she leaves on hostile terms with Mariah, moves in with Peggy and begins a relationship with a man named Paul. Despite her newfound independence, she still remains emotionally cut off from her relationships, not returning the love for Paul that he professes to her. Although by the end of the novel she reestablishes a relationship with Mariah, her independence that she sought from childhood has not been fulfilling-the novel ends with Lucy wishing she \\"could love someone so much that she would die from it.\\" Though she attempts to escape her past and detach herself from her roots, she consequently detaches herself from all relationships, leaving her feeling alone. Main characters ;Lucy: The narrator and protagonist who works as an au pair. She is a character of extremes, having conflicting feelings of both homesickness and wanting to escape the influence of her mother and Caribbean motherland. She has many loveless sexual encounters, yet she resents her mother for letting her husband dominate her life, as Lucy's mother gave up her career goals of being a nurse to be with Lucy's father who cheats on her and leaves her with nothing when he dies. Lucy is also at odds with her employer Mariah, who represents another mother figure in Lucy's life; simultaneously existing as a source of comfort and disdain in Lucy's life, similar to the role her mother Annie also plays. Lucy views both her mother Annie and Mariah as caring, comforting, and strong women who allow themselves to fall into the sexist roles that society and their husbands expect of them, thus this brings a range of extreme emotions from Lucy regarding them as they embody what Lucy longs for and disdains simultaneously. ;Annie Potter: Lucy's mother. Because she discourages Lucy's aspirations and instead encourages Lucy's brothers, she resents her and does her best to sever ties with her over the course of the novel. Nevertheless, Lucy's mother is a constant presence in her life, sending her letter and coming to Lucy's mind whenever she leasts expects it. ;Mariah: Lucy's main employer and a doting, yet emotionally strained housewife struggling to maintain a semblance of stability in her family life. ;Lewis: Mariah's husband. He is both physically and emotionally distant, choosing to work away from home for the better part of the novel. It is revealed that he has an affair with Dinah, Mariah's best friend. While Lucy does not feel strongly towards him for a large portion of the novel, she does become decidedly more hostile towards him once she learns of the affair. ;Tanner: The boy with whom Lucy has her first sexual encounter. Though the relationship was purely physical, this begins Lucy's sexual curiosity, which manifests itself in future relationships with Hugh and others. ;Miriam: The youngest daughter of Lewis and Mariah, with whom Lucy develops a special bond ;Dinah: Mariah's best friend and the woman with whom Lewis has an affair. Mariah and Lucy view her differently: Mariah envies her kindness and general outgoing nature, while Lucy is immediately suspicious of both her motives and true nature. ;Peggy: Lucy's best friend, whom she meets while in the United States. Peggy is a carefree woman from Ireland who dazzles Lucy with her knowledge of the city and the people in it. Though the two become friends, Lucy's inability to maintain particularly close relationships with anyone makes this friendship strained towards the end. However, Lucy's decision to rent an apartment with Peggy ultimately signifies a growing sense of independence from both her mother and Mariah. ;Hugh: Lucy's first boyfriend in America and Dinah's brother. Shorter, dark-haired, and good-natured, Hugh instantly makes a strong impression with Lucy. The two become immediately infatuated with each other, beginning a passionate relationship that concerns Peggy. In the end, because she does not love him, she is not sad to see him go. ;Paul: Lucy's lover, who feels more for her than she does for him. Lucy is again warned against dating, as Peggy believes Paul to be a \\"creep.\\" Motifs and themes While attending Queen Victoria girls' school, she was taught to memorise a poem about daffodils. (This poem \\"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\\" was written by William Wordsworth roughly two centuries ago.) The poem recalls the beauty of daffodils that the speaker has seen years ago. Lucy cannot appreciate this beauty, because daffodils do not grow on her island. After reciting the poem, Lucy is applauded and she explains that at this moment she feels fake. She feels like people see her as English on the inside, despite her strong antipathy towards them. The daffodils represent Lucy's alienation from both her education, and from her new home. Lucy's mother continually occupies Lucy's thoughts, exciting fury, scorn, desire, and guilt. Lucy relates a huge sum of her experiences to some memory or opinion about her mother, which proves the power of the mother-daughter bond. The very departure that Lucy hopes to make with her journey to America, however, causes her sorrow, for she believes she'll never again know the kind of love she shared with her mother. Though Lucy determines that she must break with her mother to achieve adulthood, she aches powerful feelings of loss in the process. The seasons also climax differences between Lucy's old surroundings and her new northern climate. Lucy has an attitude toward the seasons that mirrors her mixed feelings about her native country. Though she rises the amount of weather and finds the summers less cruel than at home, in the colder months, she misses the warm sun and lively colors of the island. The seasons, then, highlight both Lucy's inner and outer situations and grant them larger meaning by connecting them to a natural phenomenon experienced by many. Lucy's letters from home brighten her difficult relationship with her mother. As Lucy takes to support her mother's unopened letters on her dresser, she shows a defiance that also betrays her daughterly attachment: she doesn't discard them and doubts the longing she'd feel if she saw her mother's words. When Lucy finally reads the letter listing her father's death and her mother's disaster, she comes to her mother's financial aid but also releases her anger in a letter home, once again representing her mixed feelings. After burning the letters she's saved, Lucy finds herself able to move on. She fixes to leave Lewis and Mariah's apartment and sends a letter home, stating empathy for her mother but also breaking with her by giving an untrue address. Throughout the novel, letters serve as markers of Lucy's struggle to make a new life for herself by dodging her past. The role of Lucy‚Äôs past The driving force of the novel is Lucy's past. The story begins with Lucy arriving in North America and the reader is unsure why she left her home. Lucy is continuously referring to and hinting at past events. As her character develops, one learns that Lucy's past experiences are heavily ingrained into her perspective through which the reader hears the story. As such, Lucy's past is at the root of the recurring themes within the novel. At several points in the story, Lucy makes observations that may be unobvious to the reader. Lucy seems to see thing coming before they happen. Kincaid does this to give the impression that Lucy is notably intelligent, which turns out to be central to the novel. The author spends a lot of time dwelling on Lucy's ability to understand things, as if to point out she has a superior intellect. Readers discover later that the rift between Lucy and her mother was caused by the mother having lower expectations for Lucy. In this manner, Lucy's expression of her intelligence is directly linked to her rebellion from her mother, which happened in the past. Past of course effects future, and Lucy's fallout with her mother also resulted in her inability to love. Lucy finally obtains independence and freedom from her mother but she is unable to love because she believes that she will not be able to love anyone like she loved her mother. Due to the fact that Lucy's mother neglected her and pushed her aside after the arrival of her brothers Lucy can no longer give herself completely to anyone for fear that they will just leave her like her mother did.Kincaid, Jamaica. Lucy. New York: Farrar Straus Giroux, 1990. Another theme that works its way into the novel is the notion of reality. Lucy feels that the people she meets lead fake lives that could be improved if they focus on what matters. She is skeptical of the happiness because of her observations about Lewis and Mariah's relationship. She is also skeptical because of the negative events that happened back home. She was unhappy enough to leave and it is fundamentally difficult for her to believe everyone is as happy as they seem. This has the effect of making Lucy seem pessimistic. From her perspective, however, she is simply realistic. This viewpoint originates from her past experiences. Lucy's identity Throughout the book, we see that there is the subliminal mention of the Bront√´ sisters, Enid Blyton, Paul Gauguin, and Lucifer. Lucy mentions that instead of being named Lucy, she should have been named after one of the Bront√´ sisters (Emily, Anne, or Charlotte). These three sisters were also au-pairs. Since Lucy had gone to a British school, the curriculum involved the books written by the English Bronte authors. This demonstrates how they were the only role-models she knew of, as she was not sent to a higher education institution as her brothers were. Thus, she would have liked to be named after one of the Bront√´ sisters instead to demonstrate both the lack of attachment to her African culture, as well as her longing for her own empowerment. This can also be conveyed through her refusal to become a nurse so that she would not have to follow the orders of \\"higher powers,\\" such as doctors. Furthermore, she identifies with Lucifer because that is the origin of her name (Lucy). This reflects Lucy's embrace of her promiscuous nature, and her non-religiosity. This decimation of the roles her mother expects from her shows her rebelliousness and her resentment against her mother for not supporting her further empowerment in society. Caribbean heritage Lucy is from the West Indies. Jamaica Kincaid is from Antigua and it can be safely assumed that Lucy's character shares the same birthplace. Though this is not stated explicitly, Lucy does make a reference to her home having been named by Christopher Columbus (who \\"never set foot there\\") after a church in Spain. Other evidence includes the similarity of Kincaid's upbringing along with that of Lucy's character and the references to Antigua being a colony despite the increase in decolonisation. Critical response Lucy has often been interpreted through the dual lenses of postcolonial and feminist criticism. Gary E. Holcomb, for example, sees the novel as endorsing a black transnationalist view, as Lucy refuses to be constrained by \\"colonial, racist, and transnational values\\" of either Antigua or the US.Holcomb, Gary E. ‚ÄúTravels of a Transnational Slut: Sexual Migration in Kincaid‚Äôs Lucy‚Äù. Critique: Studies in Contemporary Fiction 44.3 (2003): 295-312. Edyta Oczkowicz similarly describes Lucy's learning to tell her own story as an act of self-translation, in which she must create \\"a new personal 'space'\\" in which her identity \\"does not have to be defined by the roles of either colonized or colonzier.\\" Oczkowicz, Edyta. \\"Jamaica Kincaid's Lucy: Cultural \`translation' as a case of creative exploration of the past\\". MELUS 21.3 (1996): 143. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 2 April 2011. Critics have also focused on the many intertexts on which the novel draws. Diane Simmons details the way in which the novel draws on John Milton's Paradise Lost and Charlotte Bront√´'s Jane Eyre, noting that Bront√´ was Kincaid's favorite author.Simmons, Diane. ‚ÄúJamaica Kincaid and the Canon: In Dialogue with Paradise Lost and Jane Eyre‚Äù. MELUS 23.2 (1998): 65-85. David Yost observes that Lucy contains many correspondences to another Bront√´ novel, Villette‚Äîincluding the names of its primary couple (Lucy and Paul), its plot (an au pair adjusting to a foreign culture), its themes (sexual repression of women and self-recreation through art), and its setting (Villette's Paul dies returning from his Caribbean slave plantation)--arguing that Lucy acts a postcolonial reworking of this earlier text.Yost, David. ‚ÄúA Tale of Three Lucys: Wordsworth and Bront√´ in Jamaica Kincaid's Antiguan Villette\\". MELUS 31.2 (Summer 2006): 141-156. Ian Smith focuses on the scene in which Lucy must memorize Wordsworth's \\"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\\" at her boarding school, despite having never seen a daffodil in Antigua. Noting that this episode recurs throughout Kincaid's work, Smith asserts that the act here of transcending an oppressive and often-nonsensical colonial education is emblematic of Kincaid's oeuvre as a whole.Smith, Ian. \\"Misusing Canonical Intertexts: Jamaica Kincaid, Wordsworth and Colonialism's 'absent things'\\".

The specimen comes from the Barremian-age Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation, near Yizhou. The most notable feature about Xianglong is its bizarre oversized ribs, eight on each side, which were attached to a membrane of body tissue and allowed the lizard to glide. It was an acrodont lizard, and a cladistic analysis indicates it was grouped with iguanians such as agamines, chamaeleonids, and leiolepidines. The fossil specimen found was long, of which was tail, although the describers say it was probably a juvenile. So far this is the only known fossil gliding lizard, though there are other unrelated animals that also use their ribs to glide. Gliding ability Xianglong is one of the few creatures that glide using their ribs. Other creatures, such as the flying squirrel and the Malabar Flying Frog, Rhacophorus malabaricus, have a different membrane attachment, toes to toes or limb to limb. Two creatures use the same way to glide, the present day Flying Lizard (genus Draco, Latin for dragon) and Triassic fossil reptiles such as Kuehneosaurus, but the Triassic look-alikes lived over 100 million years before Xianglong. Despite the \\"rib-span\\", the lizard might have been quite agile in the air, possibly to escape the feathered dinosaurs that coexisted with it.

Warning flagged the rise of post-2000 wave of traditional doom metal. The band was founded by guitarist/singer/songwriter Patrick Walker in 1994 in Harlow, Essex. Warning's music is notable for its down-tempo, progressive, melodic and heavy doom-laden sound; the idiosyncratic and poignant vocals of Patrick Walker; and his introspective, darkly-confessional lyrical themes. The band released two demo tapes, Revelation Looms in Feb 1996 and Blessed By Sabbath in March 1997 which led them to gain underground metal press attention and label interest. Warning debuted in 1999 with The Strength To Dream on Rich Walker's Miskatonic Foundation label. With this album, Warning gained a cult status within doom metal circles, but they soon disbanded after their 2001 European tour with Jack Frost. They regrouped in 2004 to perform at The Doom Shall Rise festival in Germany in 2005, and released second album Watching From A Distance in 2006 to enormous acclaim. It has been heralded as one of the most influential doom metal albums of the past 25 years and one of the landmark metal albums of the last decade. Both albums were re-issued on CD in 2008 by the label Cyclone Empire, The Strength to Dream being re-packaged in new sleeve artwork. Similarly the albums were released by the Metal Supremacy label as gatefold double-vinyl editions limited to 500 copies each, 125 of each pressed on coloured vinyl. Patrick Walker decided to discontinue the band in January 2009 and continues to write and record music as 40 Watt Sun and under his own name. Warning reunited for a one-off performance at the 2017 edition of Roadburn Festival in The Netherlands, where they played Watching From A Distance in full.

Pescarolo Sport was a motorsport team based in Le Mans, France and founded in February 2000 by French racing driver Henri Pescarolo and his friend and partner, French publisher Fran√ßois Granet. They raced in the Le Mans Series and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. In October 2007, Henri Pescarolo purchased Jacques Nicolet's Saulnier Racing and created Pescarolo Automobiles, with the racing team becoming a division of the new company. The Pescarolo Automobiles went into receivership on 15 June 2010. Following a liquidation sale, the company was resold back to Henri Pescarolo and rebranded as Pescarolo Team for the 2011 season. However, the team's financial situation did not improve, and was wound up in January 2013.  Racing history  Although Henri Pescarolo had been racing, and winning, at Le Mans for many decades, he had always been driving for other teams. From 1994 to 1998, Pescarolo had been driving for the Courage Comp√©tition squad with some success, but decided in 1999 that he would like to run his own team for the 24 Hours of Le Mans, although he would remain connected to Courage and would be a customer team of the factory's chassis. The team was initially known as the Pescarolo Promotion Racing Team, and would take a well-deserved ninth-place finish. Following this success, Pescarolo decided that he would retire from racing as a driver, but remain in sports car racing as a team owner. On January 1, 2000, Pescarolo Sport was founded in the town of Le Mans, within the grounds of the Circuit de la Sarthe and near Courage Comp√©tition's headquarters. Pescarolo remained close to Courage, using their C52 chassis, as well as reaching an agreement with Peugeot to supply new turbocharged engines. The team initially concentrated on the Le Mans 24 Hours, although they would also make an appearance at the American Le Mans Series event at Silverstone Circuit. In their first run at Le Mans, the team managed an impressive fourth- place finish for drivers S√©bastien Bourdais, Olivier Grouillard, and Emmanuel Clerico, made even more impressive by the fact that the top three finishers were all from the factory Audi team. With this success, Pescarolo Sport expanded vastly for the 2001 season, purchasing two new Courage C60 chassis (chassis numbers 03 and 04) for use in various races of the American Le Mans Series, European Le Mans Series, FIA Sportscar Championship, as well as the usual entry at Le Mans. Unfortunately the team saw their worst effort ever at Le Mans, with only a single car managing to finish in a distant 13th place. However this trouble was soon reversed in July of that year, when Pescarolo recorded their first win at the 1000km of Estoril, followed two weeks later by a win in front of a home crowd at Magny-Cours for the FIA Sportscar Championship, beating the likes of Ferrari 333 SP, Dome-Judd S101 and Ascari- Judd A410. For 2002, Pescarolo Sport settled on running a full season of the FIA Sportscar Championship, and were able to continue on from their first two wins. The team took two more victories over the course of the season, clinching second place in the teams championship behind Racing for Holland. At Le Mans though, the team did not improve much, recording only a tenth-place finish for their one finishing car. Moving to 2003, the team unfortunately suffered major difficulties. Running in the FIA Sportscar Championship again, the team started the season with a win, but suffered three straight failures to finish in the following races. Although they would win once more, the team had to settle for once again being a runner-up to Racing for Holland in the teams championship. Le Mans saw some improvement, with both car finishing and taking eighth and ninth place, however Pescarolo began to suffer financial woes. Even though the team managed to take second place at the unique 1000km of Le Mans at the end of the year, Peugeot announced their discontinuation of supplying engines to the team, also leading to the loss of sponsorship money. Pescarolo Sport en route to a second-place finish at the 2005 1000km of Spa. With the aid of investment from Sony and promotion of their PlayStation 2 as well as Gran Turismo 4, Pescarolo were able to find the money to purchase new Judd GV5 V10s, as well beginning their first work in engineering. Feeling the Courage C60s were not perfect, Pescarolo Sport began development of new bodywork and mechanical elements in order to increase the cars performance. For the 2004 the cars were renamed as Pescarolo C60s, due to the vast differences between them at standard Courage produced cars. Although still strapped for cash, the team began a one car effort in the new Le Mans Endurance Series due to the FIA Sportscar Championship folding at the end of 2003. Managing to earn points in the first two races of the season, the team finished the year tied for sixth in the championship. At Le Mans however, the team managed to regain some of their past success, with their sole finishing car taking fourth place behind a trio of Audis but also finishing ahead of a fourth Audi. 2005 saw Pescarolo improve rapidly, with the team winning two rounds of the Le Mans Endurance Series season. These wins helped Pescarolo Sport earn their first championship, earning it by a mere two points. This success continued at Le Mans, with Pescarolo earning their best finish ever, a second place behind an Audi, separated by a just two laps, and also making the fastest lap of the race. Pescarolo had been backed heavily to cause an upset and trump the dominant Audis, especially after taking pole position.http://www.planetlemans.com/2007/06/08/a-very-brief-le-mans-24-hours- history-chapter-7/ Pescarolo Sport finally become a dominant, front-running team in 2006. In the Le Mans Series, Pescarolo out performed the competition and were able to sweep the entire season, winning all five races and easily defending their championship title. At Le Mans, the team also repeated their previous success by taking another second place, this time behind the new Audi R10 diesel, although the team did manage to finish ahead of the other R10. = Pescarolo 01 = Following the end of the 2006 season, Pescarolo Sport announced their plans to develop their own, all-new chassis for 2007 in order to comply with new Le Mans Prototype regulations. The new cars, known as Pescarolo 01s, would use a brand-new chassis and bodywork evolved from the previous Pescarolo C60s. However, for the first time, Pescarolo would become a supplier, offering the 01s for sale to customer teams not only in the top LMP1 class, but also in the smaller LMP2 class. A Pescarolo 01-Judd used by Pescarolo Sport in the Le Mans Series Following on from two for Pescarolo Sport, 01s were supplied to Rollcentre Racing and Kruse Motorsport for use in the Le Mans Series season. Pescarolo ran alongside their customers, for the first time running a two car effort for a full season. Pescarolo used a new paint scheme, reminiscent of the Matra-Simcas that Henri Pescarolo ran at Le Mans in the 1970s, by being predominantly blue with red or yellow noses. At the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans, Pescarolo's chassis would perform near the top for most of the race. One of Pescarolo Sport's own cars managed to finish on the overall podium behind the diesel Audi and Peugeot, while the customer Rollcentre Pescarolo finished fourth, marking the best finishes by petrol powered cars in the race. Pescarolo Sport ended the 2007 in second place in the LMP1 standings, behind one Peugeot 908 HDi FAP but ahead of the other, while Rollcentre Racing took fourth. The Kruse LMP2 on the other hand would be unable to complete the season as the car was destroyed in a fire. =2009 until 2013= For the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans, Pescarolo Sport announces that one of the cars Pescarolo will run in the race is the diesel-powered Peugeot 908 HDi FAP loaned from Peugeot itself; they will run in the 24-hour race along with its Pescarolo-Judd original vehicle. For the 2012 season, Pescarolo announced that it would race a new car in the World Endurance Championship based upon the ill-fated Aston Martin AMR-One project. The new car would be designated the Pescarolo 03 and built around the tub of the AMR-One, of which they took delivery of 2. The car was entered in the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans race in the LMP1 class as the #16 Pescarolo 03, but retired within the first two hours of the race due to mechanical issues. Pescarolo also entered the #17 Dome S102.5. The car finished the race but was not classified in the results due to being too far down from the winning Audi R18. After Le Mans, Pescarolo Sport ran into financial difficulties and Henri Pescarolo was forced to lay off much of his team. Pescarolo retained control of the organization, however, and in 2013 announced he would be building a new Pescarolo 02 prototype for the CN2/LMP3 class. In 2014, Pescarolo Team were wound up due to a lack of assets. =New start in 2016= On May 19, 2016, Jocelyn Pedrono, took over Pescarolo Sport and began construction of prototype chassis for the Automobile Club de l'Ouest's driving school at the Le Mans circuit.

In the series, he is the captain of the Deimon Devil Bats, a high school American football club founded by him and two other students. Due to the lack of interest in the sport, Hiruma uses blackmail and threats to recruit players to Devil Bats. Hiruma witnesses Sena Kobayakawa's running abilities and forces the boy to join the team as the running back as soon as he can. Hiruma has appeared in other media from the series, including video games, original video animations (OVAs), and light novels. According to Inagaki, Hiruma was created to be a \\"devil-hero\\", or a kind of anti-hero. Due to this, Murata, the manga's illustrator, tried to give Hiruma a demonic appearance. In the OVA, released before the anime's start, he is voiced by Shin-ichiro Miki. However, in the 2005 Japanese anime television series, he was replaced by Atsushi Tamura, who was chosen by the manga series creators due to his voice, which they believed was perfect for the role. His voice actor in the English adaptation is Derek Stephen Prince. Hiruma has been well received by publications for manga and anime. Numerous pieces of merchandise in Hiruma's likeness have also been released, including decals and statues of ceramic and resin. Development and voice portrayal Riichiro Inagaki, the writer of Eyeshield 21, has said that he developed Hiruma as a character that does not follow the Japanese concepts of emphasis on sportsmanship and effort in the game; instead, Hiruma is \\"only concerned with winning\\". Inagaki intended to make an \\"anti-hero\\" or, as he refers to the concept, a \\"devil-hero\\". Yusuke Murata, the artist, chose to portray Hiruma as looking \\"close to being a demon\\", since he heard from Inagaki that Hiruma had \\"the personality of a demon.\\" Murata has noted that the Devil Bats logo \\"bears a strong resemblance to Hiruma\\". Inagaki also stated that Hiruma's name is a homage to the British former Formula One driver Damon Hill. He also visited a real military base to get inspiration for the one he draw when Hiruma's background is revealed. He was voiced by Shin-ichiro Miki in the first anime adaptation of the Eyeshield 21 manga, a 2003 Jump Festa OVA titled The Phantom Golden Bowl. The subsequent television adaptation, however, did not use Miki; rather, Atsushi Tamura was chosen. Though the animation studio administrated casting, the studio asked Inagaki and Murata for their opinions. The two both felt that Tamura was a \\"perfect fit\\" due to \\"his voice and his style\\". In the English dubbing, the role was voiced by Derek Stephen Prince. Appearances =In Eyeshield 21= Seven years prior to the start of the series, a ten-year-old Hiruma snuck into an American military base, where he witnessed a group of soldiers playing American football. He soon learned the sport's rules and managed to successfully gamble on the winning teams, accumulating a large amount of money. He entered Mao Junior High, where he met Ryokan Kurita, who encouraged Hiruma to create his own team. In order to establish an American football club, Hiruma created an information network to acquire blackmail, allowing him to threaten the vice principal of Mao into allowing the establishment of the club. Gen \\"Musashi\\" Takekura also decided to join, and the three new friends made a pact to reach the Christmas Bowl--the high school football league championship. They decided to join the Shinryuji Naga, but because Kurita could not pass the Shinryuji exam, Hiruma and Musashi went to Deimon High School, and with Kurita established the Deimon Devil Bats. At the beginning of the series, Hiruma and Kurita, now in their second year of high school, attempt to recruit new members to the Deimon Devil Bats. At first, their only successful recruit is Sena Kobayakawa, as Hiruma witnesses his incredible running speed and agility and forces him to be the team's running back. Hiruma additionally hides Sena's identity by making him wear an eyeshield and adopt the moniker \\"Eyeshield 21\\". Hiruma, through intimidation, blackmail, cyber terrorism, and other similar methods, plays a crucial role in the development of the young Devil Bats team. Hiruma's insight and strategic mind, especially his knack for devising trick plays and his psychological games, are critical in the Devil Bats' various matches. His demonic fa√ßade is also seen through by the team manager, Mamori Anezaki, whom he shares a deep understanding with despite constant bickering and teasing. After winning the Christmas Bowl, Hiruma is selected by the Ojo White Knights' Seijuro Shin to be one of Team Japan's two quarterbacks for the International Youth American Football tournament due to his knack for trick plays. Hiruma quickly settles in as the main strategist on the team. Even before this, Hiruma spies on Team USA to acquire information on the ace American players, who are considered by far the favorites to win the tournament. In typical fashion, Hiruma refuses to permit players on the team out of sympathy rather than merit, including his Devil Bats teammates, but does agree with the decision to hold a final tryout as a method of enlisting bench players. Two years later, Hiruma, now in college, is part of the college's American football team, Saikyouda, opposing some of his former teammates (students at other colleges) as they compete to play in the Rice Bowl‚Äîthe game between the best college American football teams. =In other media= Hiruma has made several appearances outside of the Eyeshield 21 anime and manga. He appears in both of the original video animations produced for the series, helping the Deimon Devil Bats defeat the Uraharajuku Boarders in a tournament called the Golden Bowl in the first original video animation, and leaving his teammates on a desert island so they train in the second. Hiruma also appears in all Eyeshield 21 games, which usually feature the original manga story, except for Eyeshield 21: Devilbats Devildays, which features exclusive stories. He also appears in the crossover games Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars as a supporting character. Reception The character of Hiruma has been well received by manga readers, and as the series continued he went on to become one of the most popular characters among the Eyeshield 21 reader base, having consistently placed near the top of the Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump character popularity polls of the series. In the first poll he placed second, behind Sena, but in another two he ranked first. He was also chosen by the readers as the character who would win an \\"Evil Showdown\\" against Agon Kongo, as well as the best quarterback in the series. In an interview, Atsushi Tamura said about Hiruma: \\"I look just like this guy\\"; and stated that he \\"think[s] there is a lot of other people who want to do the Hiruma's role\\". Several pieces of merchandise based on Hiruma have also been released, including decals and statues of ceramic and resin. Several publications for manga and anime have commented on Hiruma's character. Chris Beveridge from Mania.com stated that \\"the outlandish nature of Hiruma with his guns blazing gets old very quickly\\" and considered it a \\"downside\\" to the series. On the other hand, Ain't It Cool News' Scott Green said that \\"impish Hiruma starts out as a unique star.\\" Mania.com's Jarred Pine noted that Hiruma is \\"so completely over-the-top and out of left field that I couldn't help laughing\\" and that his \\"rude, crude, and completely unpredictable\\" behavior \\"makes his character so damn enjoyable\\". Pine concluded that Hiruma's personality was \\"instantly memorable\\" and his \\"unpredictable nature\\" was responsible for making the story \\"so enjoyable\\". The contrast with \\"Sena's hard effort and Hiruma's trickery and devilish nature\\" was also praised by Pine. Writing for Anime News Network (ANN), Carlo Santos praised Hiruma's character design as \\"imaginative\\" with his \\"lanky\\" and \\"demon-like appearance\\" and additionally commented that \\"despite his sheer ruthlessness, it's hard not to laugh as Hiruma enthusiastically resorts to blackmail in recruiting students for the team\\". Erin Finnegan of ANN also noted the \\"demonic-looking\\" aspect of Hiruma, saying he is \\"like a predecessor of Ozu from The Tatami Galaxy with a love of football\\". ANN's Zac Bertschy called Hiruma the \\"most fun\\" character insofar, making note of his \\"brash, menacing and ultimately passionate\\" personality and that \\"in a sense, Hiruma turns the 'kindly old coach-come-mentor who helps the hero along' clich√© on its ear\\". Chris Homer of The Fandom Post considered Hiruma \\"the most memorable part of the show\\", saying he is \\"everyone's favourite and most memorable character\\". Partly because of his \\"sheer insanity\\", demonstrated by his recruiting methods, and partly because of the fact he gradually shows care and trusts for the team Homer wrote that \\"he is an instantly memorable character\\" and \\"so unique in this show (and any show for that matter)\\".

Brief description of the life of an interned boy at the GJR in late 1949-1951 In the late 1940s and well into 1951, the GJR cottages were supervised by husband andwife teams referred to by all as cottage parents and called \\"Aunt\\" and \\"Uncle\\". The GJR was probably 85% self-sufficient. There was the dairy, tailor shop, barber shop, blacksmith shop and the gardens raising much of the fruit and vegetables for the institution. During this period there were 3-4 major cottages housing from 90 to 120 boys. The housing consisted of 3-4 floors. Usually the basement was where the boys remained when not outside working. The basement also provided for showers and individual lockers for each boy. The main floor was primarily the kitchen and dining room. A small TV room was also provided for those boys that qualified for TV privileges. Uncle Milty was the most popular show of the time. The third floor consisted of a bedroom for the cottage parents and several small individual bedrooms, each housing four specially privileged boys. The top floor was totally open, much like a military barracks. WWII metal bunk beds were stacked two high throughout the entire floor. The normal daily routineFor more information on daily life see \\"The Junior Republic; Its History and Ideals\\" by William R. George was to be up at 6:30 a.m. and down into the basement to take care of individual hygiene, then eat breakfast and off to work detail or school. Most of the boys who qualified were sent to the local high school in Grove City. When they returned from school, they went to whatever work area they were assigned. After supper was study time for those who attended school. Saturday morning was also a work period but Saturday afternoons were usually reserved for a movie in the gymnasium. Sunday was visitors' day when family members could come and spend the entire afternoon.

It stars Daniel Gim√©nez Cacho, Aitana S√°nchez-Gij√≥n, Mar√≠a Botto and Luis Tosar.Majar√≠n, Una Vida de Cine, p. 447 Plot Carmen and Antonio are a young couple in love, planning their upcoming wedding. Carmen works in an orange processing factory and Antonio is a long-distance truck driver for the same firm. While driving his truck on a stormy day, Antonio comes across an old picture of a group of people, among whom is Carmen looking friendly with a good-looking young man, who has his arm around her shoulder. When Antonio asks his girlfriend who was the man in the picture, Carmen quickly dismisses Antonio's doubts. The man in the shot was nobody important, she reassures him. In any case, the photograph was taken long before she met Antonio. Unhappy with that answer and feeling that his fiance is hiding something from him, Antonio looks for the truth elsewhere. He questions Luis, his best friend who introduced him to Carmen. Luis, a fellow truck driver, advises him to forget the man and the picture and instead thank his luck to be on the eve of marrying the best-looking girl in town who happens to love him. Unconvinced, Antonio visits Carmen's best friend, Cinta, a salesgirl in a shoe shop. She tells him that the guy was Jos√©‚Äîsomeone she, not Carmen, bedded. But Antonio is still suspicious. Knowing that Cinta is a big flirt now in a relationship with her boss after dumping Luis, Antonio does not really believe her. Consumed by increasing jealousy Antonio explodes and violently confronts Carmen who breaks up their engagement the same day she was trying out her wedding gown. Remorful of his actions, thinking that he went way too far, Antonio recruits the help of Luis and Cinta to ask Carmen to forgive him. Carmen still loves Antonio and they get back together. Though eaten up with jealousy, Antonio goes ahead and marries Carmen, who tries to distract him with passionate sex and promises that she wants only to be a perfect wife and get pregnant. The couple happily settle into their new home. However, once he is back on the road with his truck, Antonio plods ahead with his investigation into Jos√©'s identity. From then on, he would not stop until he finds who is the man in the photograph and what was his relationship with Carmen. Antonio wants to know the truth that he feels everybody is hiding from him. Some fellow truck drivers have known Jos√©, and they lead Antonio to the small town of Montero. Apparently Jos√© has died recently in an accident. At peace knowing that his rival is dead, Antonio gives the news to Carmen, but she tells him that Jos√© is still alive. Cinta has received a letter from Jos√©. Shortly after, Cinta, who has broken her relationship with her boss to go back with Luis, is nowhere to be found. From a prostitute in bar where Jos√© used to work Antonio learns that Jos√© is a good-for-nothing who lives by deceiving women. Tired of hiding the truth, Carmen makes a painful confession. She was madly in love with Jos√© who took advantage of her even to the point of prostituting her for a time. She was rescued by her family. She had a child fathered by Jos√©, but the kid disappeared mysteriously, probably killed by Jos√©. When Antonio finally learns that Jos√© is in Oviedo he goes there to find him. Carmen drops everything and joins Antonio in the search. They take a rifle with them. They arrive in the middle of a rain storm. They spot Jos√© with Cinta hiding from the rain under an umbrella. When Carmen points at them Antonio aims his rifle at his rival, but ultimately is hesitant to shoot. Carmen, more resolute, takes the rifle from Antonio‚Äôs hand and shoots repeatedly at the couple under the umbrella. Jos√© and Cinta fall dead while the heavy rain keeps falling.

It is a shedding card game, i.e. the winning player is the one who disposes of all of their cards (in hand and personal deck) first.  Game play  Each player begins the game with a hand of cards. The number of cards in hand and deck depend upon the number of players in the game. The remaining cards go into a draw pile. The players' castles are built in front of them. The game begins when the person with the lowest card lays a card. = Deal = Cards are dealt 3 at a time, the first set of three dealt to each player is placed face-down. These cards cannot be seen until the draw pile is gone. Players will then have been dealt 6 cards to pick up. Players choose the best 3 cards to place on top of their face down castle. These 6 cards become their entire castle and the three remaining cards become their hand to play with. Players have three cards in their hand at all times until reaching the castle. Players reach the castle without any cards in hand unless required to pick up the discard pile. = Rhythm = Players take turns playing their cards in an increasing order. If a player cannot beat the previous card they must pick up the entire pile. Each time a card is played, a card must be drawn from the deck until it is finished before moving onto the castle. = Clearing a castle = The player chooses to go from left or right on their castle. In all cases the three bottom cards must be played in the same order. The top three cards must be played first. Then the bottom three cards are played in the same order. Only you look at the card next in order on the bottom and you can only look at that card until you get rid of it. When you get rid of the previous card you may look at the card next in line and see if it is playable if not then move onto the next persons turn and wait till you can play it. When the first person‚Äôs castle is cleared then they are the winner. = Specials = Four of a kind clears the pile (clearing pile means all cards under the four of a kind and including the Four of a kind get set aside and are no longer in play) 10- if a 10 is played then it clears the pile of cards ( playing a 10 means you clear the pile by setting all the cards under the 10 and including the 10 aside out of play) 2- if a 2 is played it allows you to play any card you wish to play afterward.

The popular school, with an expanding enrolment, announced in late 2019 it anticipated future enrolment of 1330. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern- ireland-50493109 Foundation The school opened as St Patrick's College on 4 September 1967 on a site at Gortgrib in the Cherryvalley area of east Belfast with Fr. Joseph Conway as President. A sister college of St Malachy's College and St MacNissi's College, Garron Tower. By the previous April, the need for a new boys' grammar school catering for the North Down and East Belfast area had become urgent. There was no provision for Catholic grammar education east of the Lagan and it was clear, given the trends of the time, that there would be no capacity in the existing two Belfast grammar schools for boys (St Malachy's and St Mary's, Christian Brothers) for the September 1967 intake. Three priests from St Malachy's ‚Äì Head of English, Fr Joseph Conway, with Fr John O'Sullivan and Fr Albert McNally were appointed by Bishop William Philbin to found the new diocesan college. The site for the new school was Providence Farm at Cherryvalley. The property had been in the hands of the Diocese of Down and Connor since the middle of the 19th century. The college motto, chosen by Bishop William Philbin, was In omnibus gratias agite ('give thanks in all circumstances') (I Thess, 5:18)  Amalgamation and Senior Administration  In 1984 the college trustees, chaired by Bishop Cahal Daly proposed that from September 1985 the college should become co-educational and remain on the Knock site through amalgamation with the Sacred Heart of Mary Grammar School in Holywood, County Down. This new foundation became known as Our Lady and St Patrick's College, Knock with an enrolment of almost nine hundred pupils, and the motto Gratias Agamus (Let Us Give Thanks).Our Lady & St Patrick's College, Knock ‚Äì College Motto Fr Joseph Conway remained as president of the amalgamated school until 1987 when he was succeeded by Fr Patrick McKenna, who had had a distinguished teaching career in St MacNissi's College, Garron Tower. Fr McKenna served as President for twelve years until 1999 when he left teaching for full-time ministry. John Allen took over as principal of the school, the first lay person appointed to this position. Allen was replaced in the 2008/09 academic year by Dermot G Mullan a former history teacher at the college who had left to be principal at St Patrick's Grammar School, Downpatrick. Mullan retired in June 2018.https://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2018/05/03/news/belfast- school-principal-who-apologised-for-plagiarising-article-to-retire-1320005/ In June 2018 it was announced that the new principal, effective 27 August 2018, would be Deborah McLaughlin, the college's existing vice- principal.https://twitter.com/olspck/status/1011239956440928257?lang=bg  New College Buildings  The original buildings were designed for approximately 800 pupils, but with an average enrolment of 1250 from the late 1990s onwards it was clearly over stretched. There were approximately 30 mobile classrooms in the form of 15 double-room mobiles. In March 2011 all teaching transferred to the new ¬£25 million building, constructed on the existing 18-acre site.\\"Official Opening of Our Lady and St. Patrick's College, Knock 10 February 2012\\" The current (2019) chair of the governors is Leo O'Reilly, former Permanent Secretary of Department for Communities in the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Awards The college was awarded The Sunday Times Northern Ireland secondary school of the year, an award based on a survey of parents, in November 2015. In 2018, it was ranked joint first in Northern Ireland for its GCSE performance with 100% of its entrants receiving five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C, including the core subjects English and maths. In the 2019 Belfast Telegraph League Table, it was ranked joint sixth with 99.4% of its GCSE entrants in the 2017/18 exams receiving five or more grades at A* to C. in 2019 the school was ranked 13th out of 159 secondary schools in Northern Ireland with 88.0% of its A-level students who sat the exams in 2017/18 being awarded three A*-C grades.

Jan Jansz de Bakker van Woerden (Latin name: Johannes Pistorius Woerdensis; 1499 ‚Äì 15 September 1525) was a Roman Catholic priest who was the first priest in the Northern Netherlands to be put to death as a direct result of his beliefs. Biography Jan de Bakker's father was a sexton in Woerden and also tenant of the brickworks, and his surname may have been derived from that profession. Bakker was a pupil of Johannes Rhodius (Hinne Rode), headmaster of St. Jerome School of the Brethren of the Common Life in Utrecht, who was a proponent of Sacramentarianism. The Dutch Sacramentarians rejected the sacraments of the Catholic Church and denied that the host consecrated at Mass was the real body and blood of Jesus Christ. They called indulgences and pilgrimages mere idolatry and were critical of the low moral standards and conduct of the clergy. In 1520 Bakker's father called him back to Woerden, concerned that some of his views were contrary to the Church's doctrine and could get him in trouble with the authorities. Bakker transferred to the Catholic University in Leuven and in 1522 completed his education there. Bakker returned to Woerden, was ordained in Utrecht as a priest, and assisted his father as sexton and deacon. Bakker started to spread his views, some of which are considered heretical by the Church, and in May 1523 he and another priest were arrested by the steward of the castle. After a short while they were released, and it is thought that the two travelled to Wittenberg, but there is no evidence he met with Martin Luther. After he returned he continued his preaching and aggravated his conflict with the Roman Catholic Church by breaking his vow of celibacy and getting married. In the night of May 9, 1525, Bakker was arrested and the next day transferred to The Hague, where was tried by the Inquisition. Refusing to recant, he was defrocked and sentenced to death, and on September 15, 1525 burned at the stake in The Hague. His last words were a quotation of 1 Corinthians 15:55: \\"O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?\\"Last and Near-Last Words of the Famous, Infamous and Those In-Between By Joseph W. Lewis Jr. M.D. His widow saved her life by recanting views similar to her husband's and lived out her life in an abbey.

The history of General Motors (GM), one of the world's largest car and truck manufacturers, dates to more than a century and involves a vast scope of industrial activity around the world, mostly focused on motorized transportation and the engineering and manufacturing that make it possible. Founded in 1908 as a holding company in Flint, Michigan, as of 2012 it employed approximately 209,000 people around the world. With global headquarters at the Renaissance Center in Detroit, Michigan, United States, General Motors manufactures cars and trucks in 35 countries. In 2008, 8.35 million GM cars and trucks were sold globally under various brands. Current auto brands are Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Holden and Wuling. Former GM automotive brands include La Salle, McLaughlin, Oakland, Oldsmobile, Opel, Pontiac, Hummer, Saab, Saturn and Vauxhall and Daewoo. In addition to brands selling assembled vehicles, GM also has had various automotive-component and non-automotive brands, many of which it divested in the 1980s through 2000s. These have included Euclid and Terex (earthmoving/construction/mining equipment and vehicles); Electro-Motive Diesel (locomotive, marine, and industrial diesel engines); Detroit Diesel (automotive and industrial diesel engines); Allison (Aircraft engines, transmissions, gas turbine engines); Frigidaire (Appliances including refrigeration and air conditioning); New Departure (bearings); Delco Electronics and ACDelco (electrical and electronic components); GMAC (finance); General Aviation and North American Aviation (airplanes); GM Defense (military vehicles) and Electronic Data Systems (information technology). 1908‚Äì1929 GM's headquarters from 1923 until 1996, a National Historic Landmark, is now Cadillac Place state office building. General Motors was capitalized by William C. Durant on September 16, 1908, as a holding company. The next day it purchased Buick Motor Company, and rapidly acquired more than twenty companies including Oldsmobile, Cadillac, Oakland, later known as Pontiac, and McLaughlin of Canada. Dr. Campbell, Durant's son-in-law, put 1,000,000 shares on the stock market in Chicago Buick (then controlled by Durant). Durant's earlier company, the Durant-Dort Carriage Company, had been in business in Flint since 1886, and by 1900 was producing over 100,000 carriages a year in factories located in Michigan and Canada. Prior to his acquisition of Buick, Durant had several Ford dealerships. With springs, axles and other key components being provided to the early automotive industry by Durant-Dort, it can be reasoned that GM actually began with the founding of Durant-Dort. GM under Durant's leadership acquired Oldsmobile later in 1908. The next year, he brought in Cadillac, Cartercar, Elmore, Ewing, and Oakland (later known as Pontiac). In 1909, General Motors also acquired the Reliance Motor Truck Company of Owosso, Michigan, and the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company of Pontiac, Michigan, the predecessors of GMC Truck. A Rapid became the first truck to conquer Pikes Peak in 1909. In 1910, Welch and Rainier were added to the ever-growing list of companies controlled by GM. Durant lost control of GM in 1910 to a bankers trust as the deal to buy Ford for $8,000,000.00 fell through, due to the large amount of debt (around $1 million) taken on in its acquisitions. R S McLaughlin Director and friend left at the same time. Durant was forced out of the firm by the stockholders and co-founded the Chevrolet Motor Company in 1911 with Louis Chevrolet. R S McLaughlin in 1915 built Chevrolet in Canada and after a stock buyback campaign with the McLaughlin and DuPont corporations, and other Chevrolet stock holders, Durant returned to head GM in 1916, as Chevrolet owned 54.5% with the backing of Pierre S. du Pont. On October 13 of the same year, GM Company incorporated as General Motors Corporation after McLaughlin merged his companies and sold his Chevrolet stock to allow the incorporation, which in turn followed the incorporation of General Motors of Canada (reverting to General Motors Company upon emergence from bankruptcy in 2009 that left General Motors of Canada Limited as a privately owned Canadian Company). Chevrolet entered the General Motors fold in 1918 as it became part of the Corporation with R S McLaughlin as Director and Vice-President of the Corporation; its first GM car was 1918's Chevrolet 490. Du Pont removed Durant from management in 1920, and various Du Pont interests held large or controlling shareholdings until about 1950. In 1918 GM acquired the Chevrolet stock from McLaughlin Motor Car Company of Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, manufacturer of the McLaughlin automobile since 1907 (later to be renamed McLaughlin-Buick) as well as Canadian versions of Chevrolet cars since 1915. The company was renamed General Motors of Canada Ltd., with R.S. \\"Colonel Sam\\" McLaughlin as its first president and his brother George as vice-president allied with the Corporation 1919. Superior Court of Ontario Canada documents show the Corporation as indirect parent of General Motors of Canada Limited. General Motors of Canada is a 100% owned Canadian Company. 1918 also saw personnel increase at GM. The number of employees grew from about 49,000 workers to 85,000 workers. Many came from the South of the United States, as well as from Europe, to work at GM Michigan facilities. To accommodate them, GM began to build employee housing with the nearly $2.5 million set aside for the project. This would become one of General Motors top 5 expenditures for the year 1919. 1919 also brought changes to employee investment opportunities. Similar to modern-day 401(k) plans, all employees could invest a percentage of their wages or salary. GM proceeded to match every penny that their employees invested. GM's headquarters were located in Flint until the mid-1920s, when they were moved to Detroit. Its building, originally to be called the Durant Building, was designed and began construction in 1919 when Durant was president, was completed in 1923. Alfred P. Sloan became president that year, and the building was officially dedicated as the General Motors Building in 1929.http://criticaldetroit.org/tag/national-register/ GM maintained this headquarters location, now called Cadillac Place, until it purchased the Renaissance Center in 1996. The Buick Division headquarters remained in Flint until 1998 when it was relocated to the Renaissance Center. In 1920, Durant oversaw the start-up of the Sheridan line of cars, manufactured (from 1920 to 1921) in Muncie, Indiana. The Sheridan nameplate has the distinction of being the first automotive brand started from scratch by General Motors. When Buick's D. A. Burke approached Durant about the idea of designing a car from the ground up, and then marketing the car as a bridge vehicle between GM's established divisions of Chevrolet and Oakland (a four-cylinder), and between Buick and Cadillac (an eight-cylinder), respectively. To market the vehicles, Sheridan hired World War I flying ace Eddie Rickenbacker, himself an accomplished automobile racer in his own right. Through prosaic marketing and Rickenbacker's endorsements, Sheridan officials felt the production target of 300 cars a day was not only achievable but profitable as well. Just as production began to ramp up, Durant was fired for the second and final time from General Motors. Since the Sheridan was a Durant pet project, GM, now under Alfred Sloan, was left with Sheridan, one of Durant's more costly but viable caprices. Durant on the other hand knew that the vehicle was soundly engineered and knew what GM paid for the Muncie facility. In May 1921, Durant purchased the rights to the Sheridan and to the Muncie plant, with the intent on using the facility to continue building the Sheridan and Durant's new project, the Durant and Princeton automobiles, now to be built by Durant Motors. In 1925, GM bought Vauxhall of England, and then in 1929 went on to acquire an 80% stake in German automobile manufacturer Opel. Two years later this was increased to 100%. In 1931, GM acquired Holden of Australia. In 1926, GM created the Pontiac as a \\"companion\\" to the Oakland brand, an arrangement that lasted five years. The companion outsold its parent during that period, by so much that the Oakland brand was terminated and the division was renamed, Pontiac. As part of General Motors Companion Make Program, three other companion makes (Buick's Marquette, Oldsmobile's Viking, and Cadillac's LaSalle) were created. Each of these, however, had less staying power than Pontiac and was discontinued within a few years, due in large part to the Great Depression. General Motors acquired control of the 'Hertz Drive-Ur-Self System' (now better known as The Hertz Corporation), the Yellow Cab Manufacturing Company together with its subsidiaries, Yellow Coach Manufacturing Company in 1926 from John D. Hertz who joined the mainboard (John Hertz purchased the car rental business back from GM in 1953 and took it public the following year). GM also acquired the Yellow Coach bus company, and helped create Greyhound bus lines. During this period (and into the 30s), Sloan and his team established the practice of targeting each of GM's automotive divisions to a specific demographically and socio-economically identifiable market segment. Despite some shared components, each marque distinguished itself from its stablemates with unique styling and technology. The shared components and common corporate management created substantial economies of scale, while the distinctions between the divisions created (in the words of GM President Sloan) a \\"ladder of success\\", with an entry-level buyer starting out at the bottom with the \\"basic transportation\\" Chevrolet, then rising through Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, and ultimately to Cadillac. While Ford continued to refine the manufacturing process to reduce cost, Sloan was inventing new ways of managing a complex worldwide organization, while paying special attention to consumer demands. Car buyers no longer wanted the cheapest and most basic model; they wanted style, power, and prestige, which GM offered them. Sloan did not neglect cost, by any means; when it was proposed Chevrolet should introduce safety glass, he opposed it because it threatened profits.Yates, Brock. \\"10 Best Moguls\\", in Car and Driver, 1/88, p.48. Thanks to consumer financing via GMAC (founded 1919), easy monthly payments allowed far more people to buy GM cars than Ford, as Henry Ford was opposed to credit on moral principles. (Nevertheless, Ford did offer similar credit arrangements with the introduction of the Model A in the late 1920s but Ford Credit did not exist until 1959.) GM surpassed Ford Motor Company in sales in the late 1920s. 1929‚Äì1958 =The 1930s= GM logo launched in 1938, used until 1964 In 1930, GM entered aircraft design and manufacturing by buying Fokker Aircraft Corp of America (U.S. subsidiary of Fokker) and Berliner-Joyce Aircraft, merging them into General Aviation Manufacturing Corporation. Through a stock exchange GM took controlling interest in North American Aviation and merged it with its General Aviation division in 1933, but retaining the name North American Aviation. In 1948, GM divested NAA as a public company, never to have a major interest in the aircraft manufacturing industry again. GM did, however, establish their own air transportation, with the creation of the General Motors Air Transport Section (GMATS). General Motors bought the internal combustion engined railcar builder Electro-Motive Corporation and its engine supplier Winton Engine in 1930, renaming both as the General Motors Electro-Motive Division. Over the next twenty years, diesel-powered locomotives ‚Äî the majority built by GM ‚Äî largely replaced other forms of traction on American railroads. (During World War II, these engines were also important in American submarines and destroyer escorts.) Electro- Motive was sold in early 2005. In 1932, GM formed a new subsidiary ‚Äî United Cities Motor Transport (UCMT) ‚Äî to finance the conversion of streetcar systems to buses in small cities. From 1936 the company was involved in an unpublicized project, with others, in what became known as the General Motors streetcar conspiracy to buy out streetcar and intercity train transport operators using subsidiary companies, and convert their operations to use buses. In 1935, the United Auto Workers labor union was formed, and in 1936 the UAW organized the Flint Sit-Down Strike, which initially idled two key plants in Flint, but later spread to half-a-dozen other plants including Janesville, Wisconsin and Fort Wayne, Indiana. In Flint, police attempted to enter the plant to arrest strikers, leading to violence; in other cities the plants were shuttered peacefully. The strike was resolved February 11, 1937, when GM recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for its workers. =World War II= General Motors produced vast quantities of armaments, vehicles, and aircraft for the Allied war effort during World War II. Its multinational interests were split up by the combating powers during the war such that the American, Canadian and British parts of the corporation served the Allied war effort and Adam Opel AG served the Axis war effort. By the spring of 1939, the German Government had assumed day-to-day control of American owned factories in Germany, but decided against nationalizing them completely (seizing the assets and capital). Soon after the war broke out, the nationalization came.. General Motors ranked first among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.Peck, Merton J. & Scherer, Frederic M. The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis (1962) Harvard Business School p.619 GM's William S. Knudsen served as head of U.S. wartime production for President Franklin Roosevelt. The General Motors UK division, Vauxhall Motors, manufactured the Churchill tank series for the Allies. The Vauxhall Churchill tanks were instrumental in the UK campaigns in North Africa. Bedford Vehicles and GM of Canada, CMP manufactured 500,000 logistics vehicles for the UK military, all important in the UK's land campaigns. In addition to the obvious manufacture of motor vehicles for the Allied cause, GM was also a major manufacturer of aircraft. By mainstream accounts, General Motors' German subsidiary (Adam Opel AG) was outside the control of the American parent corporation during World War II. Some historians posit that GM profiteered on both sides, but Alfred Sloan's memoir. presents a description of lost control. However, GM found criticism for its tax avoidance around the Opel topic. During the war, GM declared it had abandoned its German subsidiary, and took a complete tax write-off worth \\"approximately $22.7 million\\", yet after the war, GM collected some $33 million in \\"war reparations\\" because the Allies had bombed its German facilities.Hitler's carmaker General Motors Corporations Specimen Stock Certificate =Post-war growth= At one point GM had become the largest corporation registered in the United States, in terms of its revenues as a percent of GDP. In 1953, Charles Erwin Wilson, then GM president, was named by Eisenhower as Secretary of Defense. When he was asked during the hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee if as secretary of defense he could make a decision adverse to the interests of General Motors, Wilson answered affirmatively but added that he could not conceive of such a situation \\"because for years I thought what was good for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa\\". Later this statement was often misquoted, suggesting that Wilson had said simply, \\"What's good for General Motors is good for the country.\\" At the time, GM was one of the largest employers in the world ‚Äì only Soviet state industries employed more people. In 1955, General Motors became the first American corporation to pay taxes of over $1 billion. GM operated six divisions at this time, one of which (GMC) only sold trucks. The other five settled into a hierarchy, which consisted, from most- to least- prestigious, Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac and Chevrolet. 1958‚Äì1980 By 1958, the divisional distinctions within GM began to blur with the availability of high-performance engines in Chevrolets and Pontiacs. The introduction of higher trim models such as the Chevrolet Impala and Pontiac Bonneville priced in line with some Oldsmobile and Buick offerings was also confusing to consumers. By the time Pontiac, Oldsmobile and Buick introduced similarly styled and priced compact models in 1961, the old \\"step-up\\" structure between the divisions was nearly over. The decade of the 1960s saw the creation of compact and intermediate classes. The Chevrolet Corvair was a flat 6-cylinder (air cooled) response to the Volkswagen Beetle, the Chevy II was created to match Ford's conventional Falcon, after sales of the Corvair failed to match its Ford rival, and the Chevrolet Camaro/Pontiac Firebird was GM's countermeasure to the Ford Mustang. Among intermediates, the Oldsmobile Cutlass nameplate became so popular during the 1970s that Oldsmobile applied the Cutlass name to most of its products in the 1980s. By the mid-1960s, most of GM's vehicles were built on a few common platforms and in the 1970s GM began to further unify body panel stampings. The 1971 Chevrolet Vega was GM's launch into the new subcompact class to compete against the import's increasing market share. Problems associated with its innovative aluminum engine led to the model's discontinuation after seven model years in 1977. During the late 1970s, GM would initiate a wave of downsizing starting with the Chevrolet Caprice which was reborn into what was the size of the Chevrolet Chevelle, the Malibu would be the size of the Nova, and the Nova was replaced by the troubled front-wheel drive Chevrolet Citation. In 1976, Chevrolet came out with the rear-wheel drive sub compact Chevette. In 1974, GM was the first major automobile company to offer airbags as optional equipment in a non- experimental, unlimited vehicle capacity. Called the \\"Air Cushion Restraint System\\", the safety feature was optional on specific full-size Cadillac, Buick, and Oldsmobile vehicles. The occupant safety system proved an unpopular option and was discontinued after the 1976 model year not to return until the 1990s when federal mandates made the system a requirement. While GM maintained its world leadership in revenue and market share throughout the 1960s to 1980s, it was product controversy that plagued the company in this period. It seemed that, in every decade, a major mass-production product line was launched with defects of one type or another showing up early in their life cycle. And, in each case, improvements were eventually made to mitigate the problems, but the resulting improved product ended up failing in the marketplace as its negative reputation overshadowed its ultimate excellence. The first of these fiascos was the Chevrolet Corvair in the 1960s. Introduced in 1959 as a 1960 model, it was initially very popular. But before long its quirky handling eventually earned it the reputation for being unsafe, inspiring consumer advocate Ralph Nader to lambaste it in his book, Unsafe at Any Speed, published in 1965. Coincidentally, by the same (1965) model year, suspension modifications and other improvements had already transformed the car into a perfectly acceptable vehicle, but its reputation had been sufficiently sullied in the public's perception that its sales declined over the next few years, and it was discontinued after the 1969 model year. During this period, it was also somewhat overwhelmed by the success of the Ford Mustang. The 1970s was the decade of the Vega. Launched as a 1971 model, it also began life as a very popular car in the marketplace. But within a few years, quality problems, exacerbated by labor unrest at its main production source in Lordstown, Ohio, gave the car a bad name. By 1977, its decline resulted in termination of the model name, while its siblings along with a Monza version and a move of production to Ste-Th√©r√®se, Quebec, resulted in a thoroughly desirable vehicle and extended its life to the 1980 model year. Oldsmobile sales soared in the 1970s and 1980s (for an all-time high of 1,066,122 in 1985) based on popular designs, positive reviews from critics and the perceived quality and reliability of the Rocket V8 engine, with the Cutlass series becoming North America's top selling car by 1976. By this time, Olds had displaced Pontiac and Plymouth as the #3 best-selling brand in the U.S. behind Chevrolet and Ford. In the early 1980s, model-year production topped one million units on several occasions, something only Chevrolet and Ford had achieved. The soaring popularity of Oldsmobile vehicles resulted in a major issue in 1977, as demand exceeded production capacity for the Oldsmobile V8, and as a result Oldsmobile quietly began equipping some full size Delta 88 models and the very popular Cutlass/Cutlass Supreme with the Chevrolet 350 engine instead (each division of GM produced its own 350 V8 engine). Many customers were loyal Oldsmobile buyers who specifically wanted the Rocket V8, and did not discover that their vehicle had the Chevrolet engine until they performed maintenance and discovered that purchased parts did not fit. This led to a class-action lawsuit which became a public relations nightmare for GM. Following this debacle, disclaimers stating that \\"Oldsmobiles are equipped with engines produced by various GM divisions\\" were tacked onto advertisements and sales literature; all other GM divisions followed suit. In addition, GM quickly stopped associating engines with particular divisions, and to this day all GM engines are produced by \\"GM Powertrain\\" (GMPT) and are called GM \\"Corporate\\" engines instead of GM \\"Division\\" engines. Although it was the popularity of the Oldsmobile division vehicles that prompted this change, declining sales of V8 engines would have made this change inevitable as all but the Chevrolet (and, later, Cadillac's Northstar) versions were eventually dropped. In the 1980 model year, a full line of automobiles on the X-body platform, anchored by the Chevrolet Citation, was launched. Again, these cars were all quite popular in their respective segments for the first couple of years, but brake problems, and other defects, ended up giving them, known to the public as \\"X-Cars\\", such a bad reputation that the 1985 model year was their last. The J-body cars, namely the Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunbird, took their place, starting with the 1982 model year. Quality was better, but still not exemplary, although good enough to survive through three generations to the 2005 model year. They were produced in a much-improved Lordstown Assembly plant, as were their replacements, the Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac Pursuit/G5. 1981‚Äìpresent Roger B. Smith served as CEO throughout the 1980s. GM profits struggled from 1981 to 1983 following the late 1970s and early 1980s recession. In 1981, the UAW negotiated some concessions with the company in order to bridge the recession. GM profits rebounded during the 1980s. During the 1980s, GM had downsized its product line and invested heavily in automated manufacturing. It also created the Saturn brand to produce small cars. GM's customers still wanted larger vehicles and began to purchase greater numbers of SUVs. Roger Smith's reorganization of the company had been criticized for its consolidation of company divisions and its effect on the uniqueness of GM's brands and models. His attempts to streamline costs were not always popular with GM's customer base. In addition to forming Saturn, Smith also negotiated joint ventures with two Japanese companies (NUMMI in California with Toyota, and CAMI with Suzuki in Canada). Each of these agreements provided opportunities for the respective companies to experience different approaches. The 1980s also marked the dismantling of General Motors' medium and heavy trucks, with imported Isuzu trucks taking over at the lighter end and with the heavy-duty business being gradually sold off to Volvo through a joint venture. The decade of the 1990s began with an economic recession, taking its inevitable toll on the automotive industry, and throwing GM into some of its worst losses. As a result, \\"Jack\\" Smith (not related to Roger) became burdened with the task of overseeing a radical restructuring of General Motors. Sharing Roger's understanding of the need for serious change, Jack undertook many major revisions. Reorganizing the management structure to dismantle the legacy of Alfred P. Sloan, instituting deep cost-cutting and introducing significantly improved vehicles were the key approaches. These moves were met with much less resistance within GM than had Roger's similar initiatives as GM management ranks were stinging from their recent near-bankruptcy experience and were much more willing to accept the prospect of radical change. Following the first Persian Gulf War and a recession GM's profits again suffered from 1991 to 1993. For the remainder of the decade the company's profits rebounded and it made market share gains with the popularity of its SUVs and pick-up truck lines. Rick Wagoner had served as the company's Chief Financial Officer during this period in the early 1990s. GM's foreign rivals gained market share especially following U.S. recessionary periods while the company recovered. U.S. trade policy and foreign trade barriers became a point of contention for GM and other U.S. automakers who had complained that they were not given equal access to foreign markets. Trade issues had prompted the Reagan administration to seek import quotas on some foreign carmakers. Later, the Clinton administration engaged in trade negotiations to open foreign markets to U.S. automakers with the Clinton administration threatening trade sanctions in efforts to level the playing field for U.S. automakers.Fingleton, Eamon (May 30, 2009).How the Press Stabbed Detroit in the Back . Unsustainable.org. Retrieved on July 15, 2009. Jos√© Ignacio (\\"I√±aki\\") L√≥pez de Arriort√∫a, who worked under Jack Smith in both Europe (particularly the successful turnaround of Opel) and the United States, was poached by Volkswagen in 1993, just hours before Smith announced that L√≥pez would be promoted to head of GM's North American operations. He was nicknamed Super L√≥pez for his prowess in cutting costs and streamlining production at GM, although critics said that his tactics angered longtime suppliers. GM accused L√≥pez of poaching staff and misappropriating trade secrets, in particular taking documents of future Opel vehicles, when he accepted a position with VW. German investigators began a probe of L√≥pez and VW after prosecutors linked L√≥pez to a cache of secret GM documents discovered by investigators in the apartment of two of L√≥pez's VW associates. G.M. then filed suit in a United States District Court in Detroit, using part of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which left VW open to triple damages (billions of dollars) if the charges were proved in court. VW, faced with a plummeting stock price, eventually forced L√≥pez to resign. GM and Volkswagen since reached a civil settlement, in which Volkswagen agreed to pay GM $100 million and to buy $1 billion worth of parts from GM. After GM's lay- offs in Flint, Michigan, a strike began at the General Motors parts factory in Flint on June 5, 1998, which quickly spread to five other assembly plants and lasted seven weeks. Because of the significant role GM plays in the United States, the strikes and temporary idling of many plants noticeably showed in national economic indicators. In the early 1990s, following the first Gulf War and a recession, GM had taken on more debt. By the late 1990s, GM had regained market share; its stock had soared to over $80 a share by 2000, peaking at $93.63 a share on April 28 and $50 billion capitalization. However, in 2001, the stock market drop following the September 11, 2001 attacks, combined with historic pension underfunding, caused a severe pension and benefit fund crisis at GM and many other American companies and the value of their pension funds plummeted. =Production of SUVs and trucks vs. cars= In the late 1990s, the U.S. economy was on the rise and GM and Ford gained market share producing enormous profits primarily from the sale of light trucks and sport-utility vehicles. In 2001, following the September 11th attacks, a severe stock market decline caused a pension and benefit fund underfunding crisis. GM began its Keep America Rolling campaign, which boosted sales, and other auto makers were forced to follow suit. The U.S. automakers saw sales increase to leverage costs as gross margins deteriorated. In 2004, GM redirected resources from the development of new sedans to an accelerated refurbishment of their light trucks and SUVs for introduction as 2007 models in early 2006. Shortly after this decision, fuel prices increased by over 50% and this in turn affected both the trade-in value of used vehicles and the perceived desirability of new offerings in these market segments. The current marketing plan is to tout these revised vehicles extensively as offering the best fuel economy in their class (of vehicle). GM claims its hybrid trucks will have fuel economy improvements of 25%. =Corporate restructuring and operating losses= After gaining market share in the late 1990s and making enormous profits, General Motors stock soared to over $80 a share. From June 1999 to September 2000, the Federal Reserve, in a move to quell potential inflationary pressures created by, among other things, the stock market, made successive interest rate increases, credited in part for \\"plunging the country into a recession.\\"Ruddy, Christopher (January 31, 2006)Alan Greenspan's Real Legacy . Newsmax. Retrieved on July 8, 2009.Fed funds rate. Retrieved on July 9, 2009. The recession and the volatile stock market created a pension and benefit fund crisis at General Motors and many other American companies. General Motors' rising retiree health care costs and Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB) fund deficit prompted the company to enact a broad restructuring plan. Although GM had already taken action to fully fund its pension plan, its OPEB fund became an issue for its corporate bond ratings. GM had expressed its disagreement with the bond ratings; moreover, GM's benefit funds were performing at higher than expected rates of return. In 2003, GM responded to the crisis by fully funding its pension fund with a $15 B payment; however, its Other Post Employment Benefits Fund (OPEB) became a serious issue resulting in downgrades to its bond rating in 2005. Then, following a $10.6 billion loss in 2005, GM acted quickly to implement its restructuring plan. GM began its Keep America Rolling campaign, which boosted sales, and other automakers were forced to follow suit. The U.S. automakers saw sales increase to leverage costs as gross margins deteriorated. For the first quarter of 2006, GM earned $400 million, signaling that a turnaround had already begun even though many aspects of the restructuring plan had not yet taken effect. Although retiree health care costs remain a significant issue, General Motors' investment strategy has generated a $17.1 billion surplus in 2007 in its $101 billion U.S. pension fund portfolio, a $35 billion reversal from its $17.8 billion of underfunding.Sloan, Allan (April 10, 2007).GM's High-Performance Pension Machine Washington Post, D02. In February 2005, GM successfully bought itself out of a put option with Fiat for $2 billion USD (‚Ç¨1.55 billion). In 2000, GM had sold a 6% stake to Fiat in return for a 20% share in the Italian automaker. As part of the deal, GM granted Fiat a put option, which, if the option had been exercised between January 2004 and July 2009, could have forced GM to buy Fiat. GM had agreed to the put option at the time, perhaps to keep it from being acquired by another automaker, such as DaimlerChrysler, competing with GM's German subsidiary Opel. The relationship suffered and Fiat had failed to improve. In 2003, Fiat recapitalized, reducing GM's stake to 10%. In 2006, GM had begun to apply the Mark of Excellence, which was actually the GM logo. GM had stopped putting their logo on the cars in 2009, but GM did apply the GM logo on some of the early 2010 GM models. In February 2006, GM slashed its annual dividend from $2.00 to $1.00 per share. The reduction saved $565 million a year. In March 2006, GM divested 92.36 million shares (reducing its stake from 20% to 3%) of Japanese manufacturer Suzuki, in order to raise $2.3 billion. GM originally invested in Suzuki in the early 1980s. On March 23, 2006, a private equity consortium including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Goldman Sachs, and Five Mile Capital purchased 78% of GMAC's (now Ally Financial) commercial mortgage arm, then called Capmark, for $8.8 billion. On April 3, 2006, GM announced that it would sell 51% of GMAC (now Ally Financial) as a whole to a consortium led by Cerberus Capital Management, raising $14 billion over three years. Investors also included Citigroup's private equity arm and Aozora Bank of Japan. The group will pay GM $7.4 billion in cash at closing. GM will retain approximately $20 billion in automobile financing worth an estimated $4 billion over three years. GM sold its remaining 8% stake in Isuzu, which had peaked at 49% just a few years earlier, on April 11, 2006, to raise an additional $300 million. 12,600 workers from Delphi, a key supplier to GM, agreed to buyouts and an early retirement plan offered by GM in order to avoid a strike, after a judge agreed to cancel Delphi's union contracts. 5,000 Delphi workers were allowed to flow to GM. In 2006, GM offered buyouts to hourly workers to reduce future liability; over 35,000 workers responded to the offer, well exceeding the company's goal. GM gained higher rates of return on its benefit funds as a part of the solution. Stock value began to rebound - as of October 30, 2006, GM's market capitalization was about $19.19 billion. GM stock began the year 2006 at $19 a share, near its lowest level since 1982, as many on Wall Street figured the ailing automaker was bound for bankruptcy court. But GM remained afloat and the company's stock in the Dow Jones industrial average posted the biggest percentage gain in 2006.2006 takes a soft bounce By Tom Petruno, The Baltimore Sun, Tuesday, December 26, 2006 In June 2007, GM sold its military and commercial subsidiary, Allison Transmission, for $5.6 billion. Having sold off the majority, it will, however, keep its heavy-duty transmissions for its trucks marketed as the Allison 1000 series. During negotiations for the renewal of its industry labor contracts in 2007, the United Auto Workers (UAW) union selected General Motors as the \\"lead company\\" or \\"strike target\\" for pattern bargaining. Late in September, sensing an impending impasse in the talks, the union called a strike, the first nationwide walkout since 1970 (individual plants had experienced local labor disruptions in the interim). Within two days, however, a tentative agreement was achieved and the strike ended. On June 28, 2007, GM agreed to sell its Allison Transmission division to private equity firms Carlyle Group and Onex for $5.1 billion. The deal will increase GM's liquidity and echoes previous moves to shift its focus towards its core automotive business. The two firms will control seven factories around Indianapolis but GM will retain management of a factory in Baltimore. Former Allison Transmission president Lawrence E. Dewey will be the new CEO of the standalone company.GM Agrees to Sell Allison Transmission Unit, The Wall Street Journal, June 29, 2007 Kirk Kerkorian once owned 9.9 percent of GM. According to press accounts from June 30, 2006, Kerkorian suggested that Renault acquire a 20 percent stake in GM to rescue GM from itself. A letter from Tracinda (Kerkorian's investment vehicle) to Rick Wagoner was released to the public to pressure GM's executive hierarchy, but talks failed. On November 22, 2006, Kerkorian sold 14 million shares of his GM stake (it is speculated that this action was due to GM's rejection of Renault and Nissan's bids for stakes in the company as both of these bids were strongly supported by Kerkorian); the sale resulted in GM's share price falling 4.1% from its 20 November price, although it remained above $30/share. The sale lowered Kerkorian's holding to around 7% of GM. On November 30, 2006, Tracinda said it had agreed to sell another 14 million shares of GM, cutting Kerkorian's stake to half of what it had been earlier that year. By the end of November 2006, he had sold substantially all of his remaining GM shares. After Kerkorian sold, GM lost more than 90% of its value, falling as low as $1/share by May 2009. On February 12, 2008, GM announced its operating loss was $2 billion (with a GAAP loss of $39 billion including a one time accounting charge). GM offered buyouts to all its UAW members. On March 24, 2008, GM reported a cash position of $24 billion, or $6 billion less than what was on hand September 31, 2007, which is a loss of $1 billion a month.GM Cash Burn 1B per month - Auto News Report - May 29, 2008 A further quarterly loss of $15.5 billion, the third- biggest in the company's history, was announced on August 1, 2008. On November 17, 2008, GM announced it would sell its stake in Suzuki Motor Corp. (3.02%) for 22.37 billion yen ($230 million)GM to sell stake in Suzuki to raise cash - November 17, 2008 in order to raise much needed cash to get through the 2008 economic crisis. In 2008, 8.35 million GM cars and trucks were sold globally under the brands Vauxhall, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, GM Daewoo, Holden, Pontiac, Hummer, Saab, Saturn, Wuling and Opel of Germany. =Great recession and chapter 11 reorganization= In late 2008 GM, along with Chrysler, received loans from the American, Canadian, and Ontarian governments to bridge the late-2000s recession, record oil prices, and a severe global automotive sales decline (see also automotive industry crisis of 2008‚Äì2009) due to the global financial crisis of 2008‚Äì2009. On February 20, 2009, GM's Saab division filed for reorganization in a Swedish court after being denied loans from the Swedish government. On April 27, 2009, GM announced that it would phase out the Pontiac brand by the end of 2010 and focus on four core brands in North America: Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick, and GMC. It announced that the resolution (sale) of its Hummer, Saab, and Saturn brands would take place by the end of 2009. (By November, however, proposed deals to sell Saturn to Penske and Saab to Koenigsegg had failed to materialize.) The company had previously cancelled Oldsmobile. In 2009, GM had renamed itself as General Motors Company, creating its former appellation: General Motors Corporation. On May 30, 2009, it was announced that a deal had been reached to transfer GM's Opel assets to a separate company, majority-owned by a consortium led by Sberbank of Russia (35%), Magna International (20%), and Opel employees (10%). GM was expected to keep a 35% minority stake in the new company. However, GM delayed acceptance of the deal pending other bids, notably a proposed 51% stake by Beijing Automotive. By early July, a decision had not been made, but Magna remained confident and scheduled a meeting for July 14 to announce its acceptance. After months of deliberation, however, GM decided on November 3, 2009, to retain full ownership of the German carmaker Opel, thus voiding the tentative deal with the Magna consortium. In June 2010, the company established General Motors Ventures, a subsidiary designed to help the company identify and develop new technologies in the automotive and transportation sectors.GM Creates Venture Capital Subsidiary News article from InfoGrok History of General Motors in various countries =General Motors in South Africa= General Motors was criticized for its presence in apartheid South Africa. The company withdrew after pressure from consumers, stockholders and Leon H. Sullivan.Civil Rights Crusader Leon Sullivan Dies It retained a commercial presence, however, in the form of its Opel subsidiary. Right Hand Drive Opel & Vauxhall production took place in GM's Uitenhage plants outside Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape Province, and does so to this day. =General Motors in Argentina= In 1925 General Motors settled down in Argentina and started producing the Double Phaeton standard and the Double Phaeton called \\"Especial Argentino\\". The production was completed with a sedan model, a roadster and a truck chassis also adaptable to transporting of passengers. Sales increased and soon the Oldsmobile, Oakland and Pontiac brands were incorporated into the assembly line; the capacity of the facility was not enough to supply the increasing demand and the building of a new plant was required. A new 48,000 m2 plant with a covered area was opened in 1929, and since then the Buick, Marquette, La Salle, Cadillac, Vauxhaul and Opel marques also started to be produced. When the Second World War broke out the operations were complicated. In 1941, 250,000 Chevrolets were made, but shortage of parts made car production impossible. The last Chevrolet left the plant in August, 1942.www.auto-historia.com History of General Motors in Argentina - Accessed 2008-11-10 though in order to avoid total stoppage, the company made electrical and portable refrigerators and car accessories in addition to other items. After the war, GM started producing the Oldsmobile and Pontiac lines and later Chevrolet was added. Production resumed in 1960 with Chevrolet pickups and shortly thereafter in 1962 it started assembling the first/second generation Chevy II until 1974 as Chevrolet 400, and the early third- generation (1968 model) Nova as the Chevrolet Chevy from late 1969 through 1978, both models overlapping for several years, the Chevy II marketed as a family sedan while the Nova as a sporty alternative. Thenceforth several Opel models and Chevrolet pickups are being manufactured. Corporate spin-offs =Electronic Data Systems Corporation= In 1984, GM acquired Electronic Data Systems Corporation (EDS), a leading data processing and telecommunications company, to be the sole provider of information technology (IT) services for the company. EDS became independent again in 1996, signing a 10-year agreement to continue providing IT services to General Motors.EDS and General Motors Relationship Spans More Than Two Decades. EDS. Feb 2, 2006, retrieved March 18, 2007 =Delco Electronics Corporation= Delco Electronics Corporation was the automotive electronics design and manufacturing subsidiary of General Motors. The name Delco came from the Dayton Engineering Laboratories Co., founded in Dayton, Ohio by Charles Kettering and Edward A. Deeds. Delco was responsible for several innovations in automobile electric systems, including the first reliable battery ignition system and the first practical automobile self starter. In 1936 Delco began producing the first dashboard-installed car radios. By the early 1970s Delco had become a major supplier of automotive electronics equipment. Based in Kokomo, Indiana, Delco Electronics employed more than 30,000 at its peak. In 1962 GM created the General Motors Research Laboratories, based in Santa Barbara, California, to conduct research and development activities on defense systems. This organization was eventually merged into Delco Electronics and renamed Delco Systems Operations. In 1985 General Motors purchased Hughes Aircraft and merged it with Delco Electronics to form Hughes Electronics Corporation, an independent subsidiary. In 1997 all of the defense businesses of Hughes Electronics (including Delco Systems Operations) were merged with Raytheon, and the commercial portion of Delco Electronics was transferred to GM's Delphi Automotive Systems business. Delphi became a separate publicly traded company in May 1999, and continued to use the Delco Electronics name for several of its subsidiaries through approximately 2004. Although Delco Electronics no longer exists as an operating company, GM still retains rights to the Delco name and uses it for some of its subsidiaries including the AC Delco parts division. =Hughes Electronics Corporation= Hughes logo, adopted after its new owner General Motors Hughes Electronics Corporation was formed on December 31, 1985, when Hughes Aircraft Company was sold by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to General Motors for $5.2 billion. General Motors merged Hughes Aircraft with its Delco Electronics unit to form Hughes Electronics Corporation, an independent subsidiary. This division was a major aerospace and defense contractor, civilian space systems manufacturer and communications company. The aerospace and defense business was sold to Raytheon in 1997 and the Space and Communications division was sold to Boeing in 2000. Hughes Research Laboratories became jointly owned by GM, Raytheon, and Boeing. In 2003, the remaining parts of Hughes Electronics were sold to News Corporation and renamed The DirecTV Group. =Delphi Corporation= Delphi Corp. logo Delphi was spun off from General Motors on May 28, 1999. Delphi is one of the largest automotive parts manufacturers and has approximately 185,000 employees (50,000 in the United States). With offices worldwide, the company operates 167 wholly owned manufacturing sites, 41 joint ventures, 53 customer centers and sales offices, and 33 technical centers in 38 countries. Delphi makes the Monsoon premium audio systems found in some GM and other manufacturer automobiles. On October 8, 2005, Delphi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. On March 31, 2006, Delphi announced it would sell off or close 21 of its 29 plants in the United States. =Diesel engines= Detroit Diesel was originally the GM Diesel Division then Detroit Diesel Allison Division until 1988. It made diesel engines for truck, generating set and marine use. Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) was originally the Electro-Motive Division of GM, until 2005. It made diesel engines and locomotives.

Mooney, received the Grand Cross of the German Eagle for his distinguished service to the Reich. \\"Nazi armaments chief Albert Speer told a congressional investigator that Germany could not have attempted its September 1939 Blitzkrieg of Poland without the performance-boosting additive technology provided by Alfred P. Sloan and General Motors\\". During the war, GM's Opel Brandenburg plant produced trucks, parts for Ju 88 aircraft, land mines and torpedo detonators for Nazi Germany.Hitler's carmaker Charles Levinson, formerly deputy director of the European office of the CIO, alleged in his book, Vodka-Cola extensive collaboration and information sharing between US and German divisions of General Motors during the war. Sloan's memoir presents a different picture of Opel's wartime existence.. According to Sloan, Opel was nationalized (along with most other industrial activity owned or co-owned by foreign interests) by the German state soon after the outbreak of war. Sloan presents Opel at the end of the war as a black box to GM's American management‚Äîan organization that the Americans had had no contact with for 5 years. According to Sloan, GM in Detroit debated whether to even try to run Opel in the postwar era, or to leave to the interim West German government the question of who would pick up the pieces. But Opel was never factually nationalized and the GM-appointed directors and management remained unchanged throughout the war, dealing with other GM companies in Axis and Allied countries including the United States. In 1939, defending the German investment strategy as \\"highly profitable\\", Alfred P. Sloan had told shareholders that GM's continued industrial production for the Nazi government was merely sound business practice. In a letter to a concerned shareholder, Sloan said that the manner in which the Nazi government ran Germany \\"should not be considered the business of the management of General Motors...We must conduct ourselves as a German organization. . . We have no right to shut down the plant.\\"Ford and GM Scrutinized for Alleged Nazi Collaboration, Washington Post, Monday, November 30, 1998; Page A0. After 20 years of researching General Motors, Bradford Snell stated, \\"General Motors was far more important to the Nazi war machine than Switzerland ... Switzerland was just a repository of looted funds. GM's Opel division was an integral part of the German war effort. The Nazis could have invaded Poland and Russia without Switzerland. They could not have done so without GM.\\" =Great American streetcar scandal theory= The Great American Streetcar Scandal is an unproven theory developed by Robert Eldridge Hicks in 1970 and published by Grossman Publishers in 1973 in the book \\"Politics of Land, Ralph Nader's Study Group Report on Land Use in California\\" at pp. 410‚Äì12, compiled by Robert C. Fellmeth, Center for Study of Responsive Law, and put forth by Bradford Snell again in 1974, in which GM, along with road-builders, is alleged to have engaged in a policy that triggered the shift from the mass transportation of the previous century to the 'one-person-one-car' trip of today.Stephen Leahy, Time Expired The theory states that in order to expand auto sales and maximize profits GM bought local mass transit systems and privately owned railways, following which it would proceed to eliminate them and replace them all with GM-built buses.Bradford Snell, The StreetCar Conspiracy. How General Motors Deliberately Destroyed Public Transit Alternative versions of the events have been put forth by scholars in the field. Slater, Cosgrove and Span all put forth evidence that counters Snell's theory. =Ralph Nader= Consumer advocate Ralph Nader issued a series of attacks on vehicle safety issues from GM ‚Äì particularly the Chevrolet Corvair ‚Äì in his book Unsafe at Any Speed, written in 1965. This first major work undertaken by Nader established his reputation as a crusader for safety. GM was accused of sending spies after him. The company was questioned at a Senate hearing in March 1966 about its attempted intimidation of Nader. Senators Robert Kennedy and Abe Ribicoff questioned CEO James Roche. In the end, the CEO apologized to Nader. The hearings led to legislation which created the United States Department of Transportation and predecessor agencies of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration later that year.G.M. & Ralph Nader Jack Doyle, PopHistoryDig.com, March 31, 2013 retrieved Feb 11, 2018 Nader sued GM in November 1966 for invasion of privacy, winning the case on appeal in January, 1970.Nader v.

This book, which critics acclaimed \\"blows the lid off the king of carmakers\\" was about the allegations of corruption, \\"mismanagement and total irresponsibility\\" at the top level of the company, as seen by John Z. DeLorean, the Vice-President, who, in 1973, resigned from his position in spite of a brilliant and meteoric rise. He was earning $650,000 per year and was expected to be the next President of GM. =EV1= See also * Fisher P-75 Eagle * FM/F2M Wildcat * F3M Bearcat (none actually built) * TBM Avenger * McLaughlin Carriage Company Notes :1.The father of current GM president Mark Reuss.

It is found in depths ranging from . This species is a sedentary fish and may even bury itself within the substrate. P. heterura flashes its brightly colored pectoral fins to startle predators and escape, but it may also use these fins to corner prey. This behavior has been demonstrated in other lionfish. This species can be found in the aquarium trade.  Description  Parapterois heterura grows to a maximum length of TL, however, most specimens are much smaller than this and adults are often about in length. The dorsal fin of this fish has thirteen spines with long filaments on their tips, and nine soft rays. The anal fins have two spines and seven to eight soft rays. The outer rays of the caudal fin also have filamentous extensions. Parapterois heterura is very similar in appearance to the closely related Parapterois macrura. The two species differ in that P. heterura has scales in a pit between the posterior nostrils while P. macrura does not (except for a population of P. heterura found off the coasts of West India, South Africa, and Mozambique, which may be a different species). These species do not differ much in fin spine, fin ray, gill raker counts, and most body proportions. Their differences lie in a small difference in head proportions. Also, in adults, the upper margin of the eye of P. heterura is below the base of the first dorsal fin spine, while it is above in P. macrura (this trait is not consistent in juveniles, in which the eye margin may be below in both species). Distribution This fish seems to have two separate ranges. One is on the coast of Natal in southeastern Africa and the other is in the central Indo-Pacific covering Japan, Indonesia, New Guinea and Australia. Behavior Parapterois heterura is largely nocturnal and may partially bury itself in the substrate during the day making it difficult to spot. The brightly colored pectoral fins are flared if the fish is disturbed and may startle predators but their main purpose seems to be to help corner prey when hunting. This fish feeds on small fish and bottom-dwelling invertebrates.
