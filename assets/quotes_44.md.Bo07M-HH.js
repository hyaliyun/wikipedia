It supports general aviation and light aircraft up to by planes of up to 3,000 kg. History Bad Kissingen had two different aerodromes. Military airfield The origins of the first airfield, located 3 km east of the city, are in August 1936 when the German Army \\"Baron von Manteuffel\\" Kaserne was constructed, parallel to the opening of an airfield as a component of the garrison. During World War II, Bad Kissingen was declared an \\"open city\\" and escaped Allied bombing. With all of its sanatoriums, hotels and nursing homes, the city served as a rest center for sick and injured German soldiers. On 7 April 1945, Third US Army troops entered the city without a fight. The aerodrome was taken over by the United States Army Air Forces in April 1945 as a liaison airfield for the United States occupation forces in the Bad Kissingen area. On 6 June 1945 the Headquarters of Ninth Air Force moved from Chantilly, France to Bad Kissingen. On 1 November 1945, the XII Tactical Air Command moved to Bad Kissingen from Erlangen and replaced the Ninth Air Force. Originally constructed with a Pierced Steel Planking runway, the steel was removed in 1948 and transported to the Berlin area for use in the construction of Tegel Airport. On 10 November 1947 the XII Tactical Air Command was inactivated at Bad Kissingen. In early 1948, the airfield was turned over to the United States Army. During 1949, an additional 30 acres of land were requisitioned and added to the Kaserne. The PX, Commissary, EM Club, Gym, Bowling Alley were constructed as parts of this addition. Another section was used for an ammunition storage area. In 1950, the grass runway was replaced with a bitumen runway. In 1953, another 23 acres were added to the Kaserne. The additional land was used for construction of dependent housing. On 17 February 1953, pursuant to GO #1, Hqs USAREUR, Manteuffel Kaserne was redesignated as Daley Barracks in honor of Technician Fifth Grade William T. Daley, HHB, 94th Rcn Sq (Mecz), who was awarded posthumously the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism during World War II. Daley Barracks was part of the Manteuffel-Kaserne/Daley Barracks NATO facilities until 1993 when the Americans withdrew from Bad Kissingen after the Cold War ended. Since the closure of the airfield, the area has been used by the German Federal Police as a training area.Information on AAF/EDEG The ICAO-Code EDEG had been assigned to this airfield. Civil airfield The local glider club Segelfluggemeinschaft Bad Kissingen constructed a civil airfield approximately 1 km north of the City. A control tower was added to an existing spa building, constructed around 1900, and two hangars were erected. The ICAO-Code EDFK was assigned to the civil airfield. Until 2017, the aerodrome was regularly used by the Helicopter Rescue Squadron of the State of Bavaria. Today, the airfield is used primarily by local light aircraft and gliders.

As a teenager, he taught for half a year at the Dunmullie School in Boat of Garten (1870‚Äì71), attended Baldow School in Badenoch, was employed by the Ordnance Survey in Scotland and Wales (1871‚Äì74) and returned to Baldow School for another term. Having obtained a bursary, Macbain was accepted at Old Aberdeen Grammar School (1874) and subsequently studied at King's College, Aberdeen (1876), where he graduated with an MA in philosophy. Professional career In July 1880, Macbain was appointed rector of Raining's school, Inverness, which had just become the secondary school for the entire highlands. Raining's school became part of the High Public School in 1894‚Äì95, for which Macbain continued to work until his death. He was made Legum Doctor at Aberdeen University in 1901 and received his pension in 1905. During the last two decades of his life, Macbain was one of the leading figures in a Gaelic intellectual circle which met in Inverness and Edinburgh. The group included both older members, such as Alexander Nicolson, Alexander Carmichael and Donald Mackinnon, and a younger generation which included Father Allan MacDonald, William J. Watson, George Henderson and Kenneth McLeod. Macbain never married. On 4 April 1907, he died of a cerebral haemorrhage in Stirling. He was buried in his home district Badenoch, in the Rothiemurchus churchyard. Scholarly output Macbain was involved in a substantial amount of editorial work. He worked together with Rev John Kennedy to publish the numerous transcripts which the late Rev Dr Alexander Cameron (d. 1888) had made from texts found in manuscripts. The result was the two volumes of Reliquiae Celticae (1892‚Äì94).Internet Archive He also published an annotated edition of W. F. Skene's The Highlanders of Scotland (1902) and of the History of the Mathesons by his former teacher Alexander Mackenzie; contributed to an edition of Ewan MacEachen's Gaelic Dictionary; and was editor for Celtic Magazine (1886‚Äì1888) and Highland Monthly (1889‚Äì1902). Many individual papers were published in the Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness and Transactions of the Inverness Field Club. His first book was Celtic Mythology and Religion, which appeared in 1885 (reprinted 1917). The work for which he is best known today is the philological milestone An Etymological Dictionary of the Gaelic Language (1896). Macbain published a critical edition of the Book of Deer and contributed entries on the Picts in Chambers's Encyclopaedia, articles for magazines and newspapers and reviews for the Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness (1880‚Äì1903).

MacBain was highly critical of Skene's position of the Pictish language as Q-Celtic in character.See for example his 1902 foreword to Skene's Highlanders of Scotland It has been suggested that the degree of animosity evident in MacBain's treatment of Skene may have been for personal reasons and that he was biased against him. ;Selected publications *1883‚Äì84.

Career Bickles started his career as a youth player for West Ham United. He made his debut for West Ham at Anfield in a 2‚Äì1 win in September 1963; the last occasion that West Ham would beat Liverpool on their own ground for 52 years and 42 games. During a game against Liverpool in 1966, Bickles was injured in a clash with Ian St John and dislocated his shoulder. Never fully diagnosed by West Ham doctors Bickles was accused of not putting in the effort. After only 28 appearances in all competitions for West Ham he was transferred to Crystal Palace in October 1967. Palace medical staff fully diagnosed Bickle's injury problems and discovered that a piece of bone had broken-off from his shoulder. Injury meant that he failed to play for Palace and in 1968 moved to Colchester United before becoming player/manager for Romford in the Southern League. Bickles had a short spell managing Collier Row in the Spartan League in the 1980s. Leaving football Bickles took up teaching in East Ham where, as a PE teacher, he spotted Lee Hodges playing and recommended him to \\"The Hammers\\". In the 1990s he was invited by West Ham youth coach Tony Carr, with whom he had played in the 1960s, to join the coaching staff.

Suji became a city district on October 31, 2005, about nine years after Yongin officially became a city. When Yongin City was established in 1996, both urban and rural areas were covered to become a part of the city; thus to this day, Yongin's urbanization is varied throughout different regions of the city. Suji is one of the most urbanized areas of Yongin, as it borders Seongnam City's Bundang District and Suwon City, two more well developed areas. Home to the newly built Shinsegae Department Store and Dankook University in one of its towns, Jukjeon, Suji is rapidly developing as Yongin City becomes more and more urbanized. In recent years, the district has attracted upper-class Koreans, with the completion of the Samsung East Palace in 2010. History Yong-In City first started as Yongin-hyeon, which was promoted in Yongin-gun under the 23 province system on May 26, 1895, and then the 13 providence system on August 4, 1896. As South Korea was occupied by the Japanese during the following years, new areas, including Yangji-gun, and a portion of Juksan-gun, were incorporated in Yongin-gun on April 1, 1914. This remained unchanged until 1973, when Jukjeon- ri and Guseong-myeon were incorporated under the President Decree No. 6542. At 1983, Iui-ri and Ha-ri were separated and Incorporated Suwon-city under the President Decree No.11027. When March 1, 1996, Yongin-gun promoted to Yongin- city, Suji-myeon(Viliage) as promoted to Suji-eup(Town). On December 24, 2001, Suji-eup was promoted to Suji Agency under the Yongin-City Ordinance No. 368. Several changes occurred throughout the following years until October 31, 2005, when three gu (ward) offices, Cheoin-gu, Giheung-gu, and Suji-gu, were established and Suji Agency was promoted to Suji-gu Office. Education Suji-gu has 23 elementary schools, 14 middle schools, and 7 high schools. Suji-gu is also the site of Dankook University in Jukjeon-dong. Administration Suji-Gu is divided into 9 dong (Îèô, \\"neighborhoods\\"): * Dongcheon-dong (ÎèôÏ≤úÎèô) ** Gogi-dong (Í≥†Í∏∞Îèô) * Jukjeon 1- and 2-dong (Ï£ΩÏ†ÑÎèô) * Pungdeokcheon 1- and 2-dong (ÌíçÎçïÏ≤úÎèô) * Sanghyeon 1- and 2-dong (ÏÉÅÌòÑÎèô) * Seongbok- dong (ÏÑ±Î≥µÎèô) * Sinbong-dong (Ïã†Î¥âÎèô) Culture and Tourism Suji-gu is home to Seobongsaji Hyeono Guksa Tapbi, which is a monument dedicated to the Buddhist monk, Hyeono Guksa, of the Goryeo Dynasty. It was constructed in 1185 and is located in Sinbong-dong. According to the inscription, Hyun-o-guk-sa became a disciple of Buddha at age 15 and the Most Reverend Priest in 1147. This monument represents Hyun-o-guk-sa and the continuum of great priests. Also located in Suji-gu are Stone Buddhist Statue of Mipyeongni, the biggest Buddhist statue in Yong-in City, Cheoinsung Fortress Site, where troops of the government fought against the Mongolians during the Koyro era, and Baeknyeonsa, the oldest Buddhist temple in Yong-in. Everland is a resort with a famous amusement park and hotel in the outskirts of Suji-gu, in Yongin City, which attracts visitors throughout the year. Situated next to Everland is the waterpark Caribbean Bay. Transportation Suji-gu is served well with public transportation, which includes intercity buses and Five subway station. The Bundang Line connects Suji-gu to Bundang and the rest of Seoul at Jukjeon- dong, which is home to the newly constructed Jukjeon Station. And, Four Shinbundang Line Stations: Dongcheon Station, Suji-gu office Station, Seongbok Station, Sanghyeon Station also located on Suji-gu. Buses =Transit buses to Seoul= Transit (commuter) buses are called Wide Area Lines in Seoul and with red color. Some buses operated by companies in Gyeonggi Province are in different colors (as in the picture below). Those buses are filled to capacity during rush hour. Buses to Seoul are numbered in the 9000s and 9400s in Jukjeon-dong, M4101 and 1002, 6900, 8201 in the Pungdeokcheon- dong, 1550 and 5500-2 via Sinbong-dong, 1570 via Seongbok-dong and M5115 via Sanghyeon-station. These buses serve most districts in Seoul. =Inter-city Buses= Suji-gu has many inter-city buses that are denoted with green color and are usually smaller than the red Transit buses. There is also a bus service called the Airport Limousine with direct service to both Incheon International Airport and Gimpo Airport. Subways Bundang Line is a commuter subway line of the Korail. It was first constructed for the commuters of Bundang which the name 'Bundang Line' came from. It serves southeastern Seoul and Seongnam. Jukjeon Station is in Suji-gu. Phase 2 Extension of Shinbundang Line is completed in 2016, the subway line connects Gangnam District to Seoul Subway Line 1 at Suwon City via Pangyo, Jeongja Station (Bundang), Suji, and Gwanggyo. =Expressways= Suji-gu is close to Seoul Ring Expressway and Gyeongbu Expressway. Seosuji IC and Gwanggyo-Sanghyeon IC of the recently completed Yongin-Seoul Expressway also serve Suji. Taxis In Suji-gu, taxis are not very common in the residential area but are more common in busy areas, such as Jukjeon Station and shopping malls. Local taxis are typically white with blue light that says \\"Yong-in Si\\". There are two types of taxis: an \\"ordinary\\" (ilban;ÏùºÎ∞ò) taxi and a \\"model\\" (mobum;Î™®Î≤î) taxi, which is painted black and is bigger (in size) and much more expensive than the former ones. Shopping Major shopping areas include Shinsegae Department Store in Jukjeon-dong, E-mart, Suji Fashion Town, and Lotte Mart. Shinsegae Department Store also has CJ CGV, a big movie theater. Other nearby shopping areas include Samsung Plaza in Seohyeon-dong, Bundang, and Lotte Department Store in Sunae-dong, Bundang. Development Through the development of the designated Jukjeon Residential Land Development Zone, the Shinbong-Dongcheong Residential Land Development Zone, the Seongbok Residential Land Development Zone, the urbanization process of Suji-gu accelerated under Development Plan No. 1 and No. 2. As stated previously, Jukjeon-dong itself is urbanizing very rapidly as Shinsegae Department Store was newly constructed, along with Jukjeon Station, a park, and the newly situated main campus of Dangook University from Seoul to Suji-gu.

Description The Lavta has a small body made of many ribs made using carvel bending technique. Its appearance is somewhat like a small (Turkish) oud - the strings are made from gut like an oud but it has only 7 strings in 4 courses and is tuned A dd gg c'c' (like the ud), or sometimes A dd aa d'd' (in intervals of 5ths like laouto - as well as 4ths); it is also sometimes tuned to Turkish Bolahenk tuning C G D A, which is the same as G D A E in concert pitch. The adjustable frets are made from tied bits of gut on the fingerboard, at the microtonal intervals of the makam system. This is more closely related to instruments like tanbur than to the fretless oud and the 12-frets of the octave laouto. The bridge usually has mustache-shaped ends. The fingerboard is flush with the soundboard, is often unvarnished, and has a carved and inlaid rosette. Some lavta have a pegbox like the oud (angling down), others more like a guitar (or like a bouzouki or a Greek laouto). The tuning pegs are shaped like those of the violin, with 3 on the right side and 4 on the left side of the open tuning head. History Known as a lavta (’¨’°’æ’ø’°) in Armenian, also occasionally called Politiko Laouto (Lute from Constantinople) in Greek, is an instrument that was popular in the early 20th century, particularly among the Greek and Armenian communities of Istanbul, but also the Turkish community, it was one of the many instruments played by noted Turk Tanburi Cemil Bey. It was gradually replaced by the oud and survived until this day. From the 1980s there has been a revival of interest in this instrument, and now you can find the lavta again both in Turkey and in Greece. Right hand technique is similar to an oud, with a long thin plectrum.

It has 4 nylon strings.Atlas of Plucked Instruments - Middle EastGeorgia, 3rd revised (Bradt Travel Guide) by Tim Burford, , pg. 47The Stringed Instrument Database The choghur dates back to the 12th to 16th centuries, the period between the gopuz and the Baƒülama. In the Caucasus, Iran and Anatolia, and in Sufi traditions, darvishes and ashugs used an instrument called the \\"chaghyr\\" /\\"chagur\\"/ \\"chugur\\" / \\"choghur\\" / \\"chungur\\". Presumably, the name \\"choghur\\" means \\"the musical instrument used to appeal to God and truth\\". [In Azerbaijani the word \\"chaghir\\" means \\"to call\\", \\"to appeal\\"] It may be assumed that the name of the instrument originates from the expression \\"chal-chaghyr\\" (festivity or celebration), which was later changed to \\"choghur\\". Various historical sources indicate that the choghur was used to create a high battle spirit among the soldiers of the medieval Safavid state's army. In the \\"Jahanarai Shah Ismayil Safavi\\" annals, describing the situation at the beginning of the 16th century, several lines are devoted to such an occasion: \\"At the head of the victoriously striding army, chukurs played and Turks- Varsakgs sang in order to raise the battle spirit of the warriors.\\" In his work \\"Turkmen Times in the South\\", Ali Reza Yalchin tells about the nine strings, 15 frets and perfect timbre of the choghur.16 It is possible to conclude from historical facts that in the 12th-13th centuries, the choghur replaced the ozan gopuz, and in the 15th-16th centuries, the choghur was replaced by the saz. But some versions of the choghur that were spread throughout the Caucasus and among the Iraqi Turkmens have survived until the present. The 19th-century choghur stored in the Azerbaijan History Museum has three pairs of strings and 22 frets on its neck. The body of this instrument is made of mulberry wood.. The top of the body has a wooden covering that is four mm thick. The neck and head of the instrument are made of nut wood, the pegs of pear wood. The total length of the instrument is 880 mm. The body is 400 mm long, 225 mm wide and 140 mm tall. Two resonator apertures are drilled on each side of the body, and several apertures are made on top of the sounding board. Its scale goes from the \\"do\\" of the small octave to the \\"sol\\" of the second octave. left Georgian Chonguri The Chonguri (·É©·Éù·Éú·Éí·É£·É†·Éò) is an instrument from Georgia related to the panduri, but larger and with a peg halfway down the neck. It has nylon (traditionally gut) strings. left Chungur The Chungur (–ß—É–≥—É—Ä) or Chugur http://www.atlasofpluckedinstruments.com/middle_east.htm#dagestan is an instrument played in the Caucasus region, especially Dagestan, and related to the Choghur (from Azerbaijan, etc.) and Chonguri (from Georgia). It has either four single strings or four doubled courses, or seven strings (doubled courses with the lowest course single). It can have a straight peghead (like a saz) or a pegbox with pegs from the side which bends back like a violin scroll. The soundholes are usually several small holes in the soundboard in a geometrical pattern. Traditional ones have tied frets overt the neck, and more modern ones have a raised fingerboard with metal inlaid frets. The small round body (unlike the spade-shaped chonguri) can be carved from a solid block of wood or made from separate ribs in a round shape like a small lute or domra.

Born in the Copenhagen suburb of Gentofte in 1946, Albert Gjedde spent time as an undergraduate student in Berkeley, California, United States (1964‚Äì65, 1968), Stellenbosch, Cape Province, South Africa (1968), and Lexington, Kentucky, USA (1969). Albert Gjedde received his Medical Doctor (M.D). and Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) degrees from Copenhagen University in 1973 and 1983, respectively. He did postdoctoral work in the Neurology Department of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center 1973-76 and held assistant and associate professorships in Medical Physiology at the University of Copenhagen 1976-1986. As a junior investigator, Albert Gjedde worked as a visiting scientist at universities or research institutions in Lund, Sweden; Cologne, Leipzig, and Dresden, Germany; Paris, France; Szeged, Hungary; and Baltimore, Maryland, United States.

He is Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology. He is also Member of the Academy of Europe, the Daylight Academy, and the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.  Career  Research Albert Gjedde's research focuses on the relations between neuroplasticity and neurotransmission that can be revealed by mapping radioligand binding and the neuroplastic changes of brain functions. The investigations explore the relation between energy metabolism and neurotransmission by recording the changes of energy metabolism and consciousness under pharmacological and other manipulations. He uses PET to understand the synthesis of radioligand and tracer molecules that match the neurotransmitter molecules and the behavior of these transmitters under different functional conditions of the brain, normal as well as pathological, and the spatial and temporal relations among changes of cerebral blood flow, which is commonly used as a measure of brain work, and the cerebral oxygen consumption rate, which is the precise measure of this work. Albert Gjedde's collaborations focus on experiments with volunteer subjects and patients that explore the lesions and degeneration of brain tissue in disorders such as epilepsy, ludomania, Parkinson's disease, stroke, depression, and somatizing disorders, as well as disorders related to addiction. Experiments explore the restructuring of neuronal networks that follows when sensory activity is processed by healthy subjects or volunteers suffering from inborn or acquired lesions. In 1977, with Clifford Patlak, Albert Gjedde described the Gjedde-Patlak plot, also known as Multitime Graphical Analysis (MTGA),.A.

Many existing font formats are based on the table-based SFNT format, such as TrueType, OpenType and Open Font Format, Web Open Font Format (WOFF), SIL Graphite and many other. SFNT is flexible, extensible and offers an opportunity to introduce additional table structures when needed, in a way that would not affect existing font rendering engines and text layout implementations. However, due to the limitation of SFNT system, a maximum number of 16 = 65536 can be put in one font table. This limitation is partially overcome in the derived formats using \\"OpenType Collections\\", formerly known as \\"TrueType collections\\", so that a file can contain multiple fonts with up to 65536 characters.

Biography Fritz Kurtz was born in Berlin and earned his doctorate from the University of Berlin in 1879. He relocated to C√≥rdoba, Argentina, and in 1884, took over the chair of botany at the National University of C√≥rdoba. Building on the performance studies and research begun under his predecessor, Dr. Paul Lorentz, Kurtz expanded the school's collections and published key works in the study of botany and paleobotany in Argentina. He directed the university's Museum of Botany and was an active member of the National Academy of Sciences of C√≥rdoba, initiating the exchange of research and material with similar institutions from around the world. His tenure at the Department of Botany influenced numerous younger Argentine naturalists, notably Eduardo Ladislao Holmberg and Juan Dom√≠guez. Kurtz retired from his post in 1915, and died in C√≥rdoba in 1921. His private herbarium and library were acquired by the National University of C√≥rdoba and were incorporated into the Museum of Botany.

Early life Spike was born in Buffalo, New York and educated at Denison University, Union Theological Seminary, Columbia University, and Colgate-Rochester Divinity School. He began his career as pastor at the mainline Protestant Judson Memorial Church on Washington Square in Greenwich Village in 1949, reviving the social activism of this famous urban church. During his tenure there neighborhood kids played basketball in the church‚Äôs ramshackle gym and an interracial, international residence for students was established. Spike also helped to create an art gallery where artists such as Claes Oldenburg, Allen Kaprow and Jim Dine could exhibit their, then unconventional, work. Civil rights In 1958 Spike left his parish ministry to take on a national role as General Secretary of the United Church Board For Homeland Ministries. In 1963 he was appointed the Executive Director of the National Council of Churches‚Äô Commission on Religion and Race, which became an important arm of the Civil Rights Movement. Anna Arnold Hedgeman joined his staff there as a Coordinator of Special Events. Through Spike‚Äôs efforts Protestant churches participated significantly in the March on Washington in August 1963. Spike worked with Bob Moses to set up the Freedom Summer project. Death In January 1966 Spike took a position as Professor of Ministry and Director of the Doctor of Ministry Program in the Divinity School at the University of Chicago. Less than a year after assuming his post in Chicago, Spike was bludgeoned to death at Ohio State University in Columbus on October 17, 1966. No one was ever tried for his murder; after a systematic review some church sources believe that he was assassinated. Police investigations attempted to link Spike's murder with his bisexuality. Upon learning of Rev. Spike's death, Martin Luther King Jr. was quoted as stating, \\"He was one of those rare individuals who sought at every point to make religion relevant to the social issues of our time. He lifted religion from the stagnant arena of pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities. His brilliant and dedicated work will be an inspiration to generals yet unborn. We will always remember his unswerving devotion to the legitimate aspirations of oppressed people for freedom and human dignity. It was my personal pleasure and sacred privilege to work closely with him in various undertakings.\\" Spike's son, Paul Robert Spike is an American author, editor and journalist best known as the author of the 1973 memoir Photographs of My Father about the murder of his father, in 1966.

After the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 Takahashi, an important figure of the IJN's Fleet Faction,Asada uses \\"command faction\\" for Fleet Faction and \\"administrative faction\\" for Treaty Faction. made a swift career, from commander of an obsolete cruiser in 1923 to commander of the Combined Fleet in 1934. He was instrumental in crushing the opposing moderate Treaty Faction but soon lost his command in another round of political turmoil. Career after World War One In the 1920s, the Japanese Navy brass was split into an \\"administrative\\" Treaty Faction that accepted limitations imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty and a \\"command\\" Fleet Faction that opposed them. Takahashi Sankichi, promoted by his superior Kato Kanji, was on the Fleet side headed by Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu, Kato Kanji and Admiral T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç. He held brief assignments on the high seas, commanding the cruiser (1923‚Äì1924) and battleship (1924‚Äì1925). and headed the Operations section of Naval General Staff under vice chief Kato Kanji who actually ran the organization, overwhelming its mild-mannered chief Yamashita Gentar≈ç.Asada 2006, p. 102 Takahashi became chief of staff of the Combined Fleet in 1927, when Kato Kanji assumed command and subjected the fleet to the most rigorous and risky drills, attempting to compensate numeric constraints of the Washington Treaty with superior training.Asada 2006, pp. 109-110 Ten years later, as the Commander of Combined Fleet, Takahashi upheld the same mentality: \\"If we are compelled to use the short sword to combat a foe brandishing the long sword, I am sure we shall win! We have tactics to defeat the combined fleets of Great Britain and the U.S.\\"; \\"Implant in the mind of every man and every officer that Japan will be the inevitable victor in any international conflict.\\"Rose, p. 65 He continued to rally against Washington Treaty limitations during the Geneva Naval Conference of 1927, supporting the faction of Mineo ≈åsumi and T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç.Asada 2006, p. 121 The moderates tried to restore their influence in the late 1920s but were finally crushed by the Fleet Faction in 1932-1933.Asada 2006, p. 122 In 1928, Takahashi was appointed the first commander of the newly formed First Carrier Division, IJN's first air supremacy formation.Goldstein, Dillon p. 76 Crushing the opposition In February 1932, Takahashi was appointed vice chief of Naval General Staff through the efforts of Kato KanjiAsada 2007, p. 139Gow, p. 294 while Prince Fushimi chaired the Staff from January 1932 to March 1941.Asada 2007, p. 140 Asada wrote that Takahashi \\"virtually controlled the naval high command in this capacity\\",Asada 2006, p. 165 Ian Gow argued that Prince Fushimi was an independent and capable leader in his own right.Gow, pp. 294-295 Immediately upon promotion, Takahashi revived the plans to expand the Staff authority and reduce that of the Naval Ministry that he developed for Kato Kanji in 1922.Asada 2006, p. 170 In September 1933, the Fleet Faction prevailed and Fushimi gained clear supremacy over Navy Minister Mineo ≈åsumi.Asada 2006, p. 171, describes the intrigue that forced Osumi into submission. In 1933-1934, the militarists silenced the opposition leaders and forced them to retire during the Osumi purge, thus gaining unchecked control of the Navy.Asada 2007, pp. 140-141Gow, p. 295, wrote that Asada and Stephen Pelz overemphasized the role of Kato Kanji in the 1933 events. He gives full credit to Fushimi Hiroyasu and Takahashi Sankichi. After World War II, Takahashi recalled that \\"one of his aims [in the 1932 struggle for power] was to be prepared with a war with the United States\\"; he feared that the Shanghai Incident of 1932 could escalate into a major Japanese-American war.Asada 2006, p. 171 Takahashi on board the battleship in 1935 In November 1934, Takahashi was appointed commander of the Combined Fleet and held this command for two years. Contrary to the battleship mentality of the old-school admirals, he spoke in favor of increasing aircraft carrier arm of the Fleet; his opinion was rejected by both General Staff and the Navy Ministry and ultimately cost him his career; he was cut off from any further information on the Navy's future.Peattie, p. 84 Political statements Takahashi did not have significant naval commands during World War II; Allied press called him \\"president of the East Asia Development Association\\" in 1942Japan's Duty Helds U. S. Annihilation. The New York Times. 1942, December 7. and \\"commander of the big Kure naval station\\" in 1944.Okayama Blasted. The New York Times. 1944, October 15. As the former commander of Combined Fleet, well known in Japan and abroad and not involved in actual combat, Takahashi regularly spoke to the public on military and political topics, before and afterSee for example the attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1936, he spoke that \\"Japan's economic advantage must be directed southward, with either Formosa or the South Sea Islands as a foothold\\";Myers, Peattie p. 123 in November 1940 he presented the Navy's view of the Empire's plans: \\"It will be constructed in several stages. In the first stage, the sphere that Japan demands includes Manchukuo, China, Indo-China, Burma, Straits Settlements, Netherlands Indies, New Caledonia, New Guinea, many islands in the West Pacific, Japan's mandated islands and the Philippines. Australia and the rest of the East Indies can be included later...\\".See modern comments on this statement in Rose, pp. 147-148. Takahashi was an early adopter of Aikido and invited its founder Morihei Ueshiba to the Naval Staff College as a bud≈ç instructor; Ueshiba trained IJN officers for ten years. Allied war-time sources connected Takahashi Sankichi with the Black Dragon Society that allegedly infiltrated the United States and silenced political opposition in Japan. (However, the only Takahashi listed in Richard Storry's The Double Patriots: A study of Japanese Nationalism (1956), whose sources are the IMTFE transcripts and exhibits and also the Saionji- Harada memoirs, is Takahashi Hidetomi). In the beginning of December 1945, General Douglas MacArthur placed Takahashi on the list of 59 most wanted Japanese along with Prince Nashimoto Morimasa and admiral Soemu Toyoda. He was freed in December 1948.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news- article18091978?searchTerm=Sankichi%20Takahashi References and notes Sources *Sadao Asada (2006).

He worked as an accountant for the firm of Peat, Marwick, and Mitchell (now part of KPMG), where one of his responsibilities was auditing Nutley Savings and Loan. He was hired in 1962, became comptroller and a board member the following year and executive vice president in 1971. He was named president and chairman after the death of John Dolan.

Political career He first won a seat in the New Jersey General Assembly in 1981 against Democrat Mary V. Senatore. He was unseated two years later by 26-year-old Democratic Party candidate Steve Adubato, though Kelly would take the seat back in 1985. In the Assembly, Kelly sponsored legislation in 1991 that established the first law in the state requiring children under 14 to wear a helmet while riding a bicycle, scooter or skateboard. In 1997, he sponsored legislation to set standards to license hospice programs. Other legislation among the 143 bills he authored that were signed into law include a bill requiring that all state insurance companies provide coverage for mammograms and pap smears.

The Swiss Argentine community is the largest group of the Swiss diaspora in South America. Approximately 44,000 Swiss emigrated to Argentina until 1940, who settled mainly in the provinces of C√≥rdoba and Santa Fe and, to a lesser extent, in Buenos Aires. In 1856, 200 families of immigrants from Switzerland, Germany, France, Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg founded the city of Esperanza, the forerunner of agricultural colonies in Argentina, thus kickstarting a long process of European colonization and immigration. In R√≠o Negro, Swiss settlement began in the early 19th century in the village of Colonia Suiza (\\"Swiss Colony\\"). An Argentine of Swiss origin, Dr. Ernesto Alemann, founded the Colegio Pestalozzi in 1934 with the aim of creating a place for free and humanistic education in accordance with the philosophy of Swiss pedagogue Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. F√©lix Fernando Bernasconi was a Swiss Argentine shoe manufacturer to whom Francisco Moreno sold a property on the southside of Buenos Aires. On this site Moreno had already established a charitable school. After the death of Bernasconi in 1914, additional funding by the Argentine government allowed to build the largest school in Buenos Aires at the time, called the Bernasconi Institute, which opened in 1929. Also associated with Moreno was Santiago Roth, a Swiss immigrant. Roth became a famous Argentine paleontologist who had joined Moreno on many expeditions to Patagonia and whom Moreno established as Head of the Paleontology Department at the La Plata Museum. In addition, Emilio Frey, son of a Swiss immigrant and educated in Switzerland, became an important partner of Moreno as topographer of the Comisi√≥n de limites Argentina-Chile from 1896 to 1902 to work out a new treaty for the border between the two countries.  History  Mendoza. Swiss immigration to Argentina began in February 1856 when the first group with a total of 421 European immigrants arrived in Santa Fe and by June there were already established about 200 farming families, about 1,400 people, of which more than 50% were French and German-speaking Swiss. The first colony founded by these Swiss settlers was called Esperanza, this being the main and largest Swiss colony in Argentina. The grants were awarded by lottery in 1862 and the final installment of property was given to its new occupants. Also, the province of Entre R√≠os received a lot of Swiss immigrants, especially those from French-speaking Switzerland. Many of these Franco-Swiss along with French immigrants contributed to the founding of several colonies in the province. The first agricultural and livestock production colony in Entre R√≠os was founded in 1857: San Jos√© under the auspices of then President Justo Jos√© de Urquiza. Its inhabitants spoke French, Italian and/or German and some were Catholic while others were Protestant. Democratic coexistence rules were introduced and secret suffrage was performed for the first time in Argentina's history. Another colony was Villa Urquiza, made up of Swiss families that had the province of Corrientes as their original destination but ended up settling in Entre R√≠os. Swiss Argentines during the inaugural parade of the XXXIV National Immigrant Festival in Ober√°, Misiones. In 1869 the colony of Grutly, Santa Fe was founded, followed by the colonies of Santa Mar√≠a, Colonia Nueva and Rivadavia, by Swiss and Italian immigrants. In R√≠o Negro there is a town called Colonia Suiza where the Swiss settlement was formed in the late nineteenth century. Many Swiss settlers, who had spent more than a decade in Chile, arrived in the city of Bariloche and its surroundings. One of the major Swiss pioneers was Guillermo Lehmann (born in Winterthur, Canton of Z√ºrich), who founded several villages and towns between 1870 and 1880, with Rafaela, Santa Fe being one of the most important settlements. In 1872, the colony inspector Guillermo Wilcken recorded 16,678 foreign inhabitants distributed in 34 colonies in the provinces of Santa Fe, Entre R√≠os and C√≥rdoba. Of this number, 5,957 were Swiss settlers, followed by Italians, \\"new Argentines\\" (children of foreign settlers and naturalised foreigners), French and Germans. Meanwhile, a report by the Swiss Consulate of the same date indicates a total of 10,000 Swiss residents in Argentina; about 2,000 living in Buenos Aires. One of the main factors that favoured the settlement by immigrants inside the country was the railroad. Layout of the Central Argentine Railway, from Rosario to Cordoba, encouraged the settlement of colonies along the railroad tracks. Since 1870, the Swiss were chosen to start the large-scale settlement. Thus arose the agricultural settlements of Bernstadt (today Rold√°n), Carcara√±√°, Ca√±ada de G√≥mez, Tortugas, Armstrong and many others.

During World War II, the airfield was assigned to the Defense of the Reich campaign in 1943, with several Messerschmitt Bf 109 day and night interceptor units being assigned to the airfield. The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 American Army units moved into the Herzogenaurach area in mid-April 1945 during the Western Allied Invasion of Germany and seized the airfield on 18 April 1945 with little or no opposition. Combat engineers from the IX Engineering Command cleared wreckage and mines left by the retreating German forces and opened the airfield the next day as Advanced Landing Ground \\"R-29\\". C-47 Skytrain transports immediately began using the airfield to fly in supplies to the advancing ground forces and to evacuate wounded to the rear areas. Eventually a pierced steel planking runway was laid down to support combat operations, however the war ended before any operations were flown from the field.IX Engineering Command Advanced Landing Grounds With the German Capitulation on 7 May, the airfield was redesignated as Army Air Force Station Herzogenaurach and for the next year was used by the 354th Fighter Group as an occupation Garrison, being joined in June by the 320th Bombardment Group also performing occupation duty. The Air Force units moved out in February 1946, the facility being turned over to the United States Army as part of their garrison in the N√ºrnberg Military Area. The airfield was renamed as Herzo-Base and until 1992, used the facility primarily as a radar station. The American forces pulled out of Herzogenaurach in 1992 as part of the drawdown of forces after the end of the Cold War, and the facility was returned to the German Government. After the pullout, a new civil airport was built primarily for use by Adidas, which moved its headquarters back into Herzogenaurach. The vacant military facilities were torn down and redeveloped into an extension of the company's headquarters.

It aimed at rescuing European and Zairian hostages held by FNLC rebels after they conquered the city of Kolwezi. The operation succeeded with the liberation of the hostages and light military casualties.  Context   Situation of Kolwezi  The city of Kolwezi is situated in the ore-rich region of Shaba (now Lualaba), in the South-East of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). In 1978, the city held 100,000 inhabitants in a 40 km¬≤ urban area, with city quarters, separated by hills. It is a strategic spot, as it lies on important roads and railroad lines that link Lubumbashi to Dilolo. There is an airport from the center of the city.  Hostage taking by rebels  In March 1978, a meeting took place between Algerian and Angolan officials and militants of the FNLC. Zairian intelligence was made aware of a possible destabilisation operation in the Shaba region, which had a high value because of its mines of precious materials like copper, cobalt, uranium and radium. For some months the Soviet Union had been purchasing all the cobalt available on the free market, but western intelligence did not connect this to the upcoming crisis. The FNLC operation was to be headed by Nathaniel Mbumba, assisted by officers from the Communist states of Cuba and the German Democratic Republic. In May 1978, an uprising took place in Katanga against President Mobutu Sese Seko. On 11 May, a 3,000 to 4,000 man strong FNLC rebel group arrived. The FNLC was supported by foreign mercenaries.Gilbert, Adrian. Voices of the Foreign Legion: The History of the World's Most Famous Fighting Corps. Skyhorse Publishing 2010. Departing from Angola, it had crossed neutral Zambia. Upon arriving, they took about 3,000 Europeans as hostages and carried out various executions, particularly after the intervention of Zairian paratroopers on 15 May.Raids (magazine) n¬∞ 264, mai 2008, p.45, Il y a trente ans la l√©gion sautait sur Kolwezi, par Jean-Marc Tanguy Between 90 and 280 Europeans were killed. From 15 May, hundreds of rebels started departing the city in stolen vehicles, leaving only 500 men led by Cubans, mostly were garrisoned in the quarter of Manika and in the suburbs. President Mobutu requested foreign assistance from Belgium, France and the United States.  Franco-Belgian operation   Preparation  French radio operator in a Jeep On 16 May at 00:45, the French 2e r√©giment √©tranger de parachutistes (2nd REP), led by Colonel Philippe Erulin, was put on alert. A meeting took place in West Germany between Belgian and French officials to coordinate a common operation. The meeting was a failure, as the French wanted to deploy their forces to neutralise the rebels and secure the city, while the Belgians wanted to evacuate foreigners. Eventually the Belgian Paracommando Regiment was sent independently. Meanwhile, elements of the planned operation started to leak into the press, causing fears that surprise would be lost if swift action were not taken. On 17 May, soldiers of the 2e REP embarked in 4 DC-8s of the French airline UTA and were flown from Solenzara in Corsica to Kinshasa. Heavy equipment followed in a Boeing 707, arriving on the 18th at 23:15. Preparation took place at Kinshasa military airport, notably instruction in using American parachutes that took place on the night of 18/19 May. A briefing also took place, given by Colonel Yves Gras, the French military attach√© in Kinshasa. At 11:00, the first wave took off in 2 French Transalls and 4 Zairian C-130 Hercules. Meanwhile, the Belgian Paracommandos were regrouping in Kamina. The first C-130 of the Belgian Air Force took off on 18 May at 13:15 from Melsbroek Air Base, bound for Kamina via Kinshasa. At the time authorisation for the crossing of French airspace had not yet been given, and it was obtained just as the third C-130 was taking off. Thirty-six hours afterwards, the Paracommando Regiment was deployed in Zaire and ready for action.  French Bonite (or L√©opard) and Belgian Red Bean Operations  On 19 May the 2e REP were flown from Kinshasa to Kolwezi, away. At 14:30, a 450-man first wave jumped from a altitude into the old hippodrome of the city. The drop was performed under fire from light infantry weapons, and six men were wounded as they landed, while another was isolated from his unit, killed and mutilated in the street before even removing his parachute. A violent firefight ensued in the streets, while French snipers started picking out threatening rebels, killing 10 of them at with the FR F1 sniper rifle. European hostages and those who had been able to hide started to come under the control and protection of the French. At 15:00, rebel armour attempted a counter-attack with three captured Panhard AML armoured cars, which legionnaires met with rocket and small arms fire. The lead AML-60 was knocked out at a range of fifty metres by an LRAC F1; a second AML discharged a single 90mm shell at its assailants before withdrawing. At 18:00, the city was under French control and mostly secured. During the night, rebels attempted to infiltrate but were stopped by an ambush prepared by the French Foreign Legion. On the night of 19/20 May, further fighting occurred. On the 20th, at 06:30, another wave of 250 paratroopers (the 4th company and the exploration and reconnaissance section) was dropped east of the city, taking rebel positions from behind and occupying this part of the city before noon. This group entered the P2 quarter and discovered the massacres that had occurred there. On 20 May, the Paracommando Regiment landed on the airport and headed towards the city on foot. Elements of the French Foreign Legion opened fire and a few exchanges occurred before the units identified each other; the incident did not cause casualties. The Belgians then entered Kolwezi and started evacuating Europeans towards the Airport, leaving the securing of the city to the French. The first hostages were evacuated to Europe at noon. The day after the airport was retaken, President Mobutu arrived in person to boost troop morale and reassure the population; he seized the opportunity to parade several European corpses in Villa P2. This struck Western public opinion and led to a widespread acceptance of the decision by the Elys√©e to launch the operation. Pierre Yambuya later reported that the Europeans of Villa P2 had in fact been executed by troops of Colonel Bosange because Mobutu wished to provoke an international intervention.Pierre Yambuya, L'Abattoir, √©dition E.P.O., 1980, p.57 Initially ordered to stay for 72 hours at most, the Belgians ended up staying over a month, along with Moroccan troops, supplying the population with food and maintaining order. On the afternoon of 20 May, Metalkat (now Metal-Shaba) was taken by the 2 REP, forcing 200 rebels away. Sergent-Chef Daniel was killed during the fight. This swift operation provided the paratroops with the surprise element that they exploited, capturing the centre of the city. Within two days, the entire city was under control, and 2,800 Europeans were secured and evacuated on 21 May.  Relief  The entire region soon came under control of French and Belgian paratroops, until they were relieved by an Inter-African Force (Force Interafricaine) led by 1,500 soldiers from Morocco and comprising Senegal (560‚Äì600), Togo, and Gabon. Other contributors to the force included C√¥te d'Ivoire who dispatched about 200 medics.Nathaniel Powell, Saving Mobutu: An International History of Africa's First Peacekeeping Force Between the departure of the French and the arrival of the Inter-African force, Kolwezi was under control of Mobutu's force, who arrested and executed hundreds, labeled as \\"rebels\\".Jean Kanyarwunga, R√©publique d√©mocratique du Congo Publibook 2006, p.196 The force was under the command of the Moroccan Colonel-Major Khader Loubaris, and the Senegalese contingent was under the command of Colonel Osmane Ndoye.

History  Nigeria LNG Limited was incorporated as a limited liability company on 17 May 1989, to produce LNG and natural gas liquids (NGL) for export. The plant was built by TSKJ consortium, which was led by former Halliburton's subsidiary KBR. Other participants of the consortium were Snamprogetti, Technip and JGC Corporation. The first train came into operation in 1999. In September 1999, the Bonny plant started production and was expected to send its first shipment in October. It started with sales contracts with Enel for 3.5 billion bcm/y, Enag√°s for 1.6 bcm/y, BOTA≈û for 1.2 bcm/y, and Gaz de France for 500 million cu m/year. The feed gas was provided by Shell, Elf Aquitaine and Agip. In 2013, NLNG signed an agreement with Samsung Heavy Industries and Hyundai Heavy Industries for the delivery of 4 LNG carrier ships that cost US$1.2 billion and that brought NLNG's total fleet to 23 ships. In 2015, NLNG reported a 36.6% drop in its revenue due to declining oil and gas prices (US$6.84 billion in 2015, US$10.8 billion in 2014). 2015 was the year that NLNG reached the threshold of US$85 billion of LNG exports in 15 years of business. In July 2016, Tony Attah was named managing director and CEO of Nigeria LNG. He replaced Babs Omotowa who led the company for 5 years and returned to Shell International in the Hague, Netherlands, after his departure. In August 2016, Shell declared Force majeure on most of its feed gas to the facility after a gas leak on Shell's Eastern Gas Gathering System (EGGS-1), but production kept going thanks to alternative sources of gas supplies.  Operations  Nigeria LNG Limited operates six liquefaction units (LNG trains) producing 22 million tonnes per year of LNG. This amounts to roughly 10% of the world's LNG consumption. Trains 1, 2 and 3 have production capacities of 3.2 million tonnes per year, whilst trains 4, 5 and 6 have capacities of 4.1 million tonnes per year each. The base project (Trains 1 and 2) which cost US$3.6 billion, was financed by NLNG's shareholders. The third train (expansion project), including additional storage, cost US$1.8 billion and was funded by shareholders as well as reinvested revenue from the base project. The NLNGPlus project (Trains 4 & 5) cost US$2.2 billion and was funded with a combination of internally generated revenue and third party loans amounting to US$1.06 billion. Train 6 (NLNGSix project) cost US$1.748 billion, financing was handled by shareholders. The total cost of building six LNG trains was US$9.348 billion. The company has a wholly‚Äìowned subsidiary set up in 1989, Bonny Gas Transport (BGT) Limited, which provides shipping services for NLNG. BGT was set up in Bermuda with an ordinary equity holding from Nigeria LNG Limited and preferential equity holding from the sponsors, NLNG's shareholders. Another wholly owned subsidiary of Nigeria LNG Limited is Nigeria LNG Ship Manning Limited (NSML), which was set up in 2008 to give dedicated attention to providing, developing and managing high calibre personnel for NLNG's maritime business.  Shareholders  Nigeria LNG Limited is jointly owned in the following proportions: Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) owns 49%, Shell Gas B.V. owns 25.6%, Total LNG Nigeria Ltd owns 15% and Eni International owns 10.4%.  Sponsorship  Nigeria LNG Limited (in partnership with the Nigerian Academy of Science and the Nigerian Academy of Letters) sponsors The Nigeria Prize for Science and The Nigeria Prize for Literature.  Controversy  There are investigations concerning alleged bribes of $180 million paid by the TSKJ consortium of engineering companies to Nigerian government officials (not Nigeria LNG staff) in the period 1994‚Äì2004 to obtain contracts worth more than $6 billion to win the contract to build Nigeria LNG facilities. KBR pleaded guilty, in February 2009, to paying bribes to Nigerian government officials to secure four contracts to build and expand the Nigeria LNG terminal. In Italy, Milan's prosecutors office has begun legal proceedings to bar Eni and Saipem, owners of Snamprogetti, from doing business with NNPC because of these alleged bribes paid by the TSKJ consortium to Nigerian government officials. Snamprogetti will pay $240 million in fines to avoid prosecution by the United States Department of Justice for violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In addition, Eni and Snamprogetti will pay $125 million to settle a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission case.

The vast territory included most of the Great Lakes region, expanding west and south over time into the North American continent as the French had explored. The Pays d'en Haut was established in 1610 and dependent upon the colony of Canada until 1763, when the Treaty of Paris ended New France, and both were ceded to the British as the Province of Quebec.Virtual Museum of New France ‚Äì Population of Pays d‚Äôen Haut and Louisiana History Sainte-Marie among the Hurons was established in 1639 by the French, their first mission north of the Great Lakes, along the eastern shore of Lake Huron. Following the destruction of the Huron homeland in 1649 by the Iroquois, the French missionaries returned to Canada with the remaining Hurons, who established themselves in Wendake. By 1660, France started a policy of expansion into the interior of North America from Canada, with the objectives to locate a Northwest Passage to China, to exploit the territory's natural resources, such as fur and mineral ores, and to convert the native population to Catholicism. Fur traders began exploring the pays d'en haut, the \\"upper country\\" around the Great Lakes at the time. In 1659, Pierre-Esprit Radisson and M√©dard Chouart des Groseilliers reached the western end of Lake Superior, where priests founded missions, such as the Mission of Sault Sainte Marie in 1668. In 1671, Father Jacques Marquette established a French mission at Michilimackinac that would over the next half century become a waypoint for exploration, a place for diplomatic relations with natives, and a commercial center for fur trade. On 17 May 1673, Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette began the exploration of the Mississippi River, which they called the Sioux Tongo (the large river) or Michissipi. They reached the mouth of the Arkansas River, and then returned upstream, having learned that the great river ran towards the Gulf of Mexico and not towards the Pacific Ocean as they had presumed. Northern expansion In what are today Ontario, part of Minnesota and the eastern Prairies, various trading posts and forts were built such as Fort Kaministiquia (1679), Fort Frontenac (1673), Fort Saint Pierre (1731), Fort Saint Charles (1732) and Fort Rouill√© (1750). Southern expansion In 1701, Antoine Laumet de La Mothe founded Fort Pontchartrain du D√©troit, which became the center of French military presence in the region. Other forts in the area strengthened the network such as Fort Niagara (1678), Fort Crevecoeur (1680), Fort de Buade (1683), Fort Saint-Louis du Rocher (1683), Fort Saint Antoine (1686), Fort Saint-Joseph (1691), Fort Michilimackinac (1715), Fort Miami (1715), Fort La Baye (1717), Fort Ouiatenon (1717), Fort Chagouamigon (1718), and Fort Beauharnois (1727). These forts provided French sovereignty in the area and facilitated commerce with the natives. In 1717, southern areas nearer the Mississippi River known as the Illinois Country were transferred from Canada to Louisiana, a colony of France south at the mouth of the river. Settlements The French settlements in the Pays d'en Haut south of the Great Lakes were Detroit, La Baye, Sault Sainte-Marie, Saint Ignace, and Vincennes. Vincennes was later attached to Pays des Illinois, which was part of Louisiana. By 1773, the population of Detroit was 1,400. By 1778, its population was up to 2,144.Jacqueline Peterson, Jennifer S. H. Brown, Many roads to Red River (2001), p69 Protecting the Pays d'en Haut were four forts: Fort Presque Isle (1753), Fort Le Boeuf (1753), Fort Duquesne (1754), and Fort Machault (1754). Recent terminology Today, the term Les Pays-d'en-Haut refers to a regional county municipality in the Laurentides region of Quebec, north of Montreal. It is the traditional name of a larger area in the hills northwest of Montr√©al, centred on upper portions of Rivi√®re du Nord (Laurentides) river. Its settlements were founded well after the original meaning of the name had become obsolete. The series Les Belles Histoires des pays d'en haut takes place in that area.

Decision support interventions help people think about choices they face; they describe where and why choice exists; and they provide information about options, including, where reasonable, the option of taking no action. These interventions aim to help people to deliberate, independently or in collaboration with others, about options by considering relevant attributes to help them forecast how they might feel about short, intermediate and long-term outcomes which have relevant consequences. Decision aids can be of any type but are most commonly pamphlets, videos, or web-based tools. Decision aids support the process of constructing preferences and eventual decision making, appropriate to their individual situation. Usage There are numerous ways in which decision aids can be used. They can be brief enough to be used during a clinical encounter or they can have sufficient content to be used before or after clinical encounters. Although decision aids have been available since the early 1980s, evidence suggests that they are not well integrated into routine practice. Efficacy Decision aids provide people with a greater understanding of their medical treatment options and empower people to participate in their own health decision making. Supplementing patient- education consultations with decision tools improves people's knowledge about the risks and benefits of a procedure or medication and may help them make decisions that are in line with their personal values. No adverse effects have been identified. It is not clear what type of decision aid for patients is cost-effective. It is also not clear what impact the use of clinical decision aid systems that assist people who face healthcare treatments or screening decisions may have on the overall healthcare system. It is not known if decision aids are helpful for people who are not strong readers. Producers There are also many active research groups in the field, including the University of Ottawa, Dartmouth College, Cardiff University and Hamburg; the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality uses the IPDAS standards to produce its decision aids. Standards There has been an increase in use of decision support and a global interest in developing these interventions among both for-profit and not-for-profit organisations. It is therefore essential to have internationally accepted standards to assess the quality of their development, process, content, potential bias and method of testing and evaluation. The International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration has published a checklist, and, more recently, an assessment instrument (IPDAS) to evaluate the quality of decision support interventions. In its November 2013 issue, BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making published a supplement that described the 10-year evolution of the IPDAS Collaboration and 12 core dimensions for assessing the quality of patient decision aids. While specifying minimum standards for patient decision support interventions is a feasible development, it is unclear whether the minimum standards can be applied to interventions designed for use within clinical encounters and to those that target screening and diagnostic tests.

ORC is an international Order, with its Grand Lodge in Norway, and jurisdictions in Sweden, United States, Canada, Argentina, Spain, Greece, Brazil and England.  Organisation  Ordre Reaux Croix distinguishes itself from other contemporary Martinist orders, in two ways: Firstly, in that it is specifically dedicated to research, implementation and publication of Martinist literature, also of historical relevance in academic circles.Lothar Diehl Initiatenorden und Mysterienschulen: Ein F√ºhrer f√ºr Suchende auf dem wesentlichen Erkenntnisweg, Zerling, Germany (2005) Secondly in that it operates all three previous forms of Martinism under one banner, an approach to the tradition previously unknown by esoteric scholars.Henke Lasson Samtidstenkningens innbyrdes stridigheter, H√∏gskoleforlaget, √Ös 2009  The historical research of ORC  Attention is paid to translating and making public the hitherto forgotten works of the Russian Martinists, such as the printer and statesman Ivan Vladimirovich Lopukhin and the philanthropist Nikolay Novikov, who introduced the age of Enlightenment to Russia.Raffaella Faggionato A Rosicrucian Utopia in Eighteenth-Century Russia Springer, the Netherlands 1997 Apart from being prolific writers and reformers of the late Tsarist regime, their contributions to both literary, scholarly and social developments, with the establishment of printing presses, public schools and hospitals for the poor. Works of these authors are not readily available in English, but are now placed in the public domain on the webpage of the Order.  The codependency of the Martinist traditions within the ORC  Since the conception of what is commonly referred to as \\"Martinism\\", all the original ways that the tradition have been operated, is now gathered and reworked into a single initiatic body, where every branch is codependent on the others. Voie Cardiaque Voie Cardiaque The mysticism of Saint-Martins, as organized by Papus.Arthur Edward Waite Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin The French Mystic and the Story of Modern Martinism William Rider & Son, London, 1922 Voie Cardiaque ‚Äì The Way of the Heart is the mystical and contemplative branch of the ORC, from whose roots the two other branches of the Order spring. This is the inner path, working toward the universal Reintegration of mankind. The teachings of the V.C. are Christian in nature and based directly upon the works of Louis Claude de St Martin, who wrote under the name The Unknown Philosopher. Saint-Martin was born in a noble family in Amboise, France, on 18 January 1743. He became one of Martinez de Pasqually's students in the Elus Cohen, and also his close friend and secretary. St Martin was a Freemason and an Elus Cohen for many years. He decided to leave both these Orders and the praxis of theurgy, in order to work in a purely mystical way. He began to instruct students in his own teachings, which were mainly influenced by Pasqually's doctrine, but later on also inspired by the writings of the Christian mystic Jacob Boehme. Saint-Martin died on 13 October 1803, leaving behind a great number of students spread across Europe, passing on the teachings through the centuries. The Summit of these teachings is the initiation Saint-Martin describes in this way: \\"The only initiation which I advocate and which I look for with all the ardor of my Soul, is that by which we are able to enter into the Heart of God within us, and there make an Indissoluble Marriage, which makes us the Friend, the Brother and Spouse of the Repairer ‚Ä¶ there is no other way to arrive at this Holy Initiation than for us to delve more and more into the depth of our Soul and to not let go of the prize until we have succeeded in liberating its lively and vivifying origin.\\" The pathway to this state of mind is given to the aspirant through a series of degrees, in the manner adopted by Papus at the end of the 19th century. The ORC scale of the rituals, have however been reformed, to first purge them of most of the Masonic style, and has incorporated more Christian elements, and older teachings, more specifically from the original doctrine of St Martin, and the Russian legacy he left behind him. The inner circle of ORC is continuously writing new material, based upon their studies and experience of attainment. We are very loyal to the teachings and symbolic language of our founding Fathers and the Past Masters, and do not incorporate other branches of esotericism not related to Martinism. Elus Cohens Pasqually's system, the oldest magical order in history.G√©rard Encausse La magie c√©r√©monielle de Martines de Pasqually Arbre d‚ÄôOr, Gen√®ve 2007 The ORC: Elus Cohen is the theurgical branch of the order, working with magical ceremonies and doctrines deriving from the founder of the Tradition, Martinez de Pasqually. The aim of the order is to mend the wounds that Man brought upon himself after falling from grace. Man will retake his former and right position in the celestial hierarchies by the aid of Christ the repairer and redeemer, and the work of theurgical operations. The work is further to reintegrate everything into its former virtues and powers, to the greater glory of our Lord God. The initiate learns many techniques and methods in this work; among the most important is prayer, invocations of God and his agents and angels, and exorcisms and banishing of the Adversary and his agents. Martinez de Pasqually was the son of Messier de la Tour de la Case, a French master mason with an inheritable patent, giving him the right to open new lodges. This patent was given to Martinez de Pasqually by his father and was made by the Grandmaster of the Stuart lodge, namely Prince Charles Edward Stuart. Martinez de Pasqually began to gather members for his new system in 1754, by the founding of the Chapter 'Les Juges Ecoissase' in Montpellier. In 1765 he received blessings from the French grand lodge for his work, after having informed them that he had opened 5 lodges on his Stuart patent. This recognition made the system legal, and was thus one of the early high degree systems in freemasonry. The Sovereign sanctuary was formed in 1767, and the years to come until Pasqually's death in 1774, were the golden years of the rite, with lodges in almost all of the larger cities in France. After the death of its founder the rite slowly disappeared from the initiatory scene, but the activity continued in smaller groups. The seed or lineage of the Order lives on, but does so in other systems, unbroken to this day. The Elus Cohen of the ORC was opened at the equinox 250 years after Pasqually started his work by founding the Order. ORC has kept all the essential parts of the system of the 18th century intact, but has when needed taken necessary measures for its survival in the 21st century with regards to the lives of its initiates of today. The Elus Cohen is worked in a total of 7 degrees. New degrees are only given when the initiate has fulfilled his work and proven his skill.  Chevalier Bienfaisant de la Cit√© Sainte  Jean-Baptiste Willermoz' chevalry system.Jean-Baptiste Willermoz L'Homme-Dieu : Trait√© des deux natures, suivi de \\"Le Myst√®re de la Trinit√©\\" Association Rosicrucienne, Paris 1999 The CBCS is the chivalric branch of the Martinist tradition, where knighthood meets the Martinist doctrine. The aim of the CBCS is enable the Chevalieres to follow the Imitation of Christ, and adopt a life of moral chivalry as the basis of all spiritual attainment. Furthering the personal work of rebuilding what once was lost, the work of the Knights and the Dames of the order is to manifest the charitable teachings of martinism in the world through beneficent and unselfish deeds. CBCS is thus the chivalric branch of the Martinist tradition, the poor knights of Christ. The original creator of the CBCS, was Jean Baptiste Willermoz (1730 ‚Äì 1824), close friend and student of Martinez de Pasqually: When Pasqually died in 1774, the teachings of his master were at risk of being lost, and Willermoz then decided to use a Masonic body as a vehicle for the inner and secret teachings of the Order of Elus Cohens. Willermoz was a pragmatic esoteric scholar and innovator. His work as a Freemason is of fundamental impact and erudition, but has been forgotten over the centuries. But he is often viewed as an ardent knight of truth fighting to rectify the decadence of secret societies and the lack of sincere desire for enlightenment within them. He is credited not only for securing the survival of Martinism with the CBCS but was also the original author behind the Rose Croix degree of freemasonry, as it is now known in Scottish rites. He was an avid archivist in several rites, and held an extensive collection of the original Elus Cohen material, which he treasured above any other: at the age of ninety-two he advised his last student, the Baron of Turkheim to make Pasqually's Treatise his primary and daily study. These teachings were his to expound upon, as he held the highest degree in the old order of Pasqually, and thus he, in his well-known luminous and inspired style, reformed them into a suitable form of chivalric tradition whose aim was the practical application of Martinism in human society. CBCS was originally intimately connected to the German Masonic rite of the templar order, the Stricte Observance of Baron von Hund, where Willermoz was given the right to reform the degrees to encompass the teachings of his own master. As the ORC is a Martinist order, we practice a reformed branch of the CBCS based upon the direct teachings and lineages of our predecessors. The reformed ORC: CBCS is thus absolutely independent of Masonic tradition, or any obedience that uses these knightly degrees or affiliations. The Order has a total of 7 degrees of work, and one administrative degree. These are divided into three independent classes. The Order is open to both men and women of good standing, of at least the age of 24, with different initiation rituals for Knights and Dames. The Secret Martinist teachings formerly kept in the class of \\"Profession\\", the 7th and first degree of the old Secret Class, are in the ORC developed into every faculty and degree of the CBCS branch. This ensures that Martinist doctrine is prevalent over, and replaces all other symbolic languages, enabling the rite to stand out as a pure Martinist chivalric way of reintegration, presented with the words and directions of Willermoz' legacy.  Teachings  The teachings of the order, is based on three pillars: Christian mysticism, kabbalah, and Martinism as established by Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin, Martinez de Pasqually and Jean-Baptiste Willermoz. As opposed to many contemporary martinist orders, the teachings of the ORC, both current and forthcoming, based directly on the teachings of the former. It is thus transmitted within the framework of Christianity. Nevertheless, the order invites 'all men and women of desire of goodwill, and a belief in a divinity', independent of religious denomination. These teachings are transmitted from one person to another in an Oratory or a Temple, and all matters of our work is based on a close relationship between teacher and student. The tradition stems from and incorporates authentic lineages and material from the Elus Cohens, CBCS, Ordre Martiniste, and the Russian Martinists and Theorists.Robert Ambelain Occult and Mystical Freemasonry 1643-1943: Martinism History and Doctrine Editions Niclaus, Paris 1946 References External links * Ordre Reaux Croix Category:Martinism Category:Christian mysticism Category:Esoteric Christianity Category:Christian organizations established in 2002 ","title":"Ordre Reaux Croix"},{"id":"24934290","text":"Stampe is a surname of German origin.

It encompasses the part of Copenhagen located on the island of Amager, east of the major shopping street Amagerbrogade.Prior to an administrative reform in 2006-08, the district was known as Sundby√∏ster. Amager √òst holds within its limits a heterogeneous mixture of areas, to the north Amagerbro, straddling the border with Amager Vest, is a dense \\"-bro district\\"-style residential neighbourhoods while other areas are dominated by allotments, Single-family houses or, sometimes abandoned, industrial sites. Amagerbro used to be a run-down working-class neighbourhood but has undergone considerable urban renewal. Also the areas along the √òresund coast has undergone considerable redevelopment, most notably with the establishment of Amager Strandpark in 2005 with a 2 km long artificial island and a total of 4.6 km of beaches. Geography Amager √òst has an area of 8.60 km¬≤ and a population of 49,705. The district is bordered by Amager Vest to the west along Amagerbrogade, T√•rnby Municipality to the south and √òresund to the east. To the northwest Amager √òst is bordered by Christianshavn, located on the other side of the broad, former moat og Slotsgraven, and to the north by Holmen which is also located on the other side of the water. thumb History Sundby√∏ster takes its name from a village in the area founded in the 11th century. By Royal order, Dutch crafts- and boatsmen were granted permission to settle in the area. This started an industrialization of the area, particularly around 1870. In 1902 the northern part of Amager was incorporated into Copenhagen Municipality and a dense working-class neighbourhood developed in the area around Holmbladsgade. By 1980 most industrial activities had been discontinued and the area became dominated by trade and service-oriented businesses. In 1997 a programme for urban refurbishment (Danish: Byfornyelse) of the area was commenced. The M2 line of the Copenhagen Metro opened to Lergravsparken on October 18, 2002 and the extension to Copenhagen Airport was inaugurated on September 2007. Another important event in the district's modern history was the opening of Amager Strandpark in 2005. At the administrative reform in 2006-08, the district's name was changed from Sundby√∏ster to Amager √òst. Amager √òst today After urban renewal, particularly the area around Holmbladsgade is today recognized as an attractive and lively residential neighbourhood. An important step in the refurbishment of the area was the construction of the Holmbladsgade Sports and Culture Centre, designed by Dorthe Mandrup. Amager Strandpark has, since its inauguration in 2005, become the primary beach destination for Copenhageners and a venue for a variety of sports and cultural activities.

Description Argyroderma testiculare in cultivation These distinctive plants are among those known as \\"living stones\\", because their highly succulent, usually stemless, blue-green leaves occur at ground level and can resemble small stones. They form small clumps of a few or many paired, usually cylindrical to egg-shaped leaves that are cleft in the center. Each stem bears just 2 leaves per season but may produce offsets over the years. In some species the old leaves persist and form a short column on which new leaves develop. Solitary daisy-like flowers, usually white, yellow, or purple, appear in the cleft. Distribution The entire genus is naturally confined to a relatively small region in the far west of South Africa, known locally as the \\"Knersvlakte\\" area. This is a very arid region of winter- rainfall desert and rocky quartzite sands. Cultivation Like most succulents, they require extremely well-drained soil, and are damaged by repeated frosts. Their preferred mode of cultivation is a bright and sunny position with gritty free-draining soil. They may be propagated from seed, or careful division of established clumps.

Located in the province of La Spezia, Liguria, northern Italy, it is the smallest national park in Italy at 4,300 acres, but also the densest with 5,000 permanent inhabitants among the five towns. In addition to the territory of the towns of Cinque Terre (Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso al Mare), the Cinque Terre National Park encompasses parts of the communes of Levanto (Punta Mesco) and La Spezia (Campiglia Sunsets).Le Cinque Terre, April 2012 www.lecinqueterre.org Cinque Terre was included as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. The collection of five cliff-side towns on the Ligurian Coast linked by a series of trails highlights a delicate relationship between man and the environment. As modification of the landscape has been so vital for the area's development and tourist industry, the National Park is an essential tool in preserving and maintaining the natural landscape while promoting sustainable tourism that vital to the economic success of Cinque Terre. To achieve its objectives, the Park Organization encourages the development of responsible tourism, able therefore to invest in the identity of the places and the territory's products, and thus save its immense heritage of terracing, now endangered.Cinqueterre Residence Description  View Of Vernazza The Cinque Terre National Park was established on 6 October 1999 in recognition of the territory's considerable scenic, agricultural, historical and cultural value. Two years before, the area was insrted in the list of World Heritage Sites. The five medieval towns along the Ligurian Coast provide scenic views of rugged terrain reeled in with terraced stone walls, where the mountains of 'Appennino Ligure come straight to the sea. The form and disposition of the towns as they embrace topography embedded in the cliffs are a testament to the long history of settlement and the terraced cultivated lands to the agricultural heritage of the area.Plummer, Henry 1988 Cinque Terre. Places. 4, no. 2: 46. As the first Italian park created to safeguard a landscape that has been mostly built by humans, the Cinque Terre National Park and Protected Marine Area aim to protect cultural heritage of ‚Äúthe park of Man.‚Äùhttp://www.parconazionale5terre.it The site's location and topography is a vital part of the identity of Cinque Terre, whose extreme typological restraints and access to the coast inherently provide for a delicate relationship between man and the natural environment. That relationship has led to a dual existence, focused on both land and sea.Plummer, Henry 1988 Cinque Terre. Places. 4, no. 2: 46. For more than a thousand years, man has cut the steep slopes for terrace farming and vineyards while at sea maintaining a strong fishing culture. The beauty of Cinque Terre lies not in a pristine environment void of man, but rather the interplay of the two. Known for its natural environment and coastal hiking trails, Cinque Terre is a tourist destination that draws people from all over the world, the numbers rising to 3.5- 5 million in the month of August alone.Bottazzi, C. 2006 Evaluation of the tourist demand in management plans for UNESCO sites : The case of the Cinque Terre Park (Italy). First International Symposium on Environmental Identities and Mediterranean Area 1: 500‚Äì505. While there is great concern for the environmental effects of such numbers of visitors, tourism is essential, having long replaced farming and fishing as the area's chief economy. Recognizing the value of sustainable ecotourism, the goal of World Heritage areas like Cinque Terre National Park is to maintain the ecosystem in a functional state by preserving the fine balance between tourism and agriculture.Carrier, James G., West, Page. 2004 Ecotourism and Authenticity. Current Anthropology. 4(4) 483-251. Flora Even though the Mediterranean flora have obvious features, there are many microclimates often different from each other which created a huge variety of landscapes. There are pine, Aleppo pine, corks and chestnut. Rock and coastal environments produce numerous Mediterranean species such as samphire and sea cineraria. Flora is visible everywhere even as shrub rosemary, thyme, helichrysum and lavender. Also present are several species of trees and succulents clearly visible from many trails. Fauna The environment is conducive to the development of life and habitat of several animal species. Among the birds are the gull, the peregrine falcon and the raven. Among the mammals are the dormouse, weasel, mole, badger, marten, fox and wild boar (whose presence is resented for damage to crops). The reptiles that thrive in the rock are the common wall lizard, the lizard and various snakes such as the rat snake, the grass snake of Aesculapius and the viper; around streams live amphibians like frogs and salamanders. Land degradation One of greatest threats to the Cinque Terre region and one the National Park works to address, is land degradation. Today, a large percentage of cultural heritage sites are classified by governmental authorities as exposed to landslide risk. In Italy in particular, whose terrain is 75% mountainous or hilly, 13/36 (36%) of heritage sites are affected by slope instability problems, including the Cinque Terre region.Canuti, P. 2004 Landslide activity as a Geoindicator in Italy : Significance and new perspectives from remote sensing. Berlin: Springer International. The landslide activity of a region can be attributed to many factors. According to GNDCI, most current landslides in the Apennines are recently dormant, reactivated with climate change. While this explanation links the problem more to environmental and geological factors, mankind also plays a large role in the problem. Relevantly to Cinque Terre, changes in land use and agricultural practices have drastic effects on landslides and their outcomes. In a comparison of images of Cinque Terre land terracing in 1958 and 2000, there appears a clear increase in soil erosion and degradation of vineyard terraces that is consistent with agriculture abandonment in the 1960s as the main focus of the area shifted to tourism and away from the careful \\"landscape engineering\\" of previous centuries.Canuti, P. 2004 Landslide activity as a Geoindicator in Italy: Significance and new perspectives from remote sensing. Berlin: Springer International. According to city officials, in 1951, about 3,500 acres of Cinque Terre land were cultivated, compared to 275 today.Povoledo, Elisabetta 2012 In Liguria's Coastal Hills, a Storm's Fury Brings a Struggle for Restoration. New York: New York Times 8-7. As land was already in a state of degradation in 2011, terrace abandonment is thought to be a contributing factor to the flash flood disaster of 25 October 2011. After 4 hours of uncharacteristic 22 inches of rain and subsequent flash floods, the towns of Monterosso al Mare and Vernazza were virtually destroyed. The other three cities, due to natural topography and effective draining systems, went mostly undamaged.Steves, Rick. May 2012 Cinque Terre Six Months After the Flood. https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cinque-terre-flood-six-mo_b_1468422. For these reasons, one of the foremost agendas of the National Park, is the maintenance and revitalization of the slopes. The value in promoting terracing is two-fold, as it not only addresses landslide control but also recognizes the history and traditions of the villages by bringing back the traditional Cinque Terre vineyards. The \\"Uncultivated Lands\\" LIFE Project, co-founded in 2001 by the European Community and the Cinque Terre National Park, seeks to recover the unused terraces and to return them to their previous success for production of Albarola and Vermentino vineyards.Parco Nazionale delle Cinque Terre 2012 Uncultivated Lands: A Recovered Hill. http://www.parconazionale5terre.it. One such hill, Corniolo, is featured as not only an educational tool for researchers interested in safe and effective cultivating practices, but also as a \\"laboratory\\" to bring back the famed grapes that, in combination, shaped Cinque Terre's reputation as wine producers in the Middle Ages.Parco Nazionale delle Cinque Terre 2012 Traditional Cinque Terre Vineyards Back to Life. http://www.parconazionale5terre.it. A sub-project, in cooperation with Agricultura Cinque Terre seeks to do just that, by reintroducing some of the traditional ancient grapes of the region. In addition, the success of \\"Uncultivated Lands\\" has been an invaluable model for other areas, such as the UNESCO site of Ifugao, Philippines, who are interested in perfecting and re- establishing thousand-year old cultivation practices within their own communities.Parco Nazionale delle Cinque Terre 2012 Ifugao and Cinque Terre: the terraces of men. http://www.parconazionale5terre.it. Characteristic coastal stretch of Cinque Terre UNESCO World Heritage Site At UNESCO‚Äôs meeting on 5 December 1997 the Cinque Terre, Portovenere and the islands of Palmaria, Tino and Tinetto, were added to its World Heritage List under the heading of a cultural landscape. An important site both environmentally and culturally, it was described as ‚Äúthe harmonious interaction between people and nature to produce a landscape of exceptional beauty\\". The addition of Cinque Terre to the list also addressed it as a world- known tourist destination. The site was enrolled under a number of criteria, including: # shows an important interchange of human values, over a period of time or within a cultural area of the world, in the context of developments in architecture or technology, monumental arts or in the planning or urban (landscape) in the design of landscape (ii); # is a remarkable example of a type of a complex of buildings or architectural or technological or landscape which illustrates a significant moment in human history (iv); # is a remarkable example of a traditional human settlement or land use that is typical of a culture (cultures), especially if they become vulnerable due to the impact of irreversible change (v). Ecotourism The past three decades have seen a significant growth in tourism, in turn providing new economic opportunities for places like Cinque Terre.Giavelli, Giovanni. 1999 The Aeolian Project: A Mab-UNESCO Investigation to Promote Sustainable Tourism in the Aeolian Islands. The International Journal of Environmental Studies 56(6) 833‚Äì847. Ecotourism is a branch of the industry with immense benefits, as its aim is the enjoyment and appreciation of a natural landscape in an environmentally-conscious manner. For tourists, there is often an expectation of a pristine untouched environment, and an interest in the local population as a part of that landscape. In Cinque Terre, the greatest draw for tourists are the hiking trails and scenery among authentic traditional settlements. This socio-cultural element is essential as it highlights the heritage and culture of the picturesque Italian villages.Buckley Ralf. 2004 Impacts Positive and Negative: Links Between Ecotourism and Environment. Environmental Impacts of Ecotourism. Ecotourism book series, volume 2. Wallingford, Oxon, GBR: CABI Publishing. Cinque Terre's popularity can be contributed to the establishment of the park in 1999 and the addition to the UNESCO World Heritage Site, both of which embrace ecotourism and the need for sustainability. A result of extensive efforts towards infrastructure, improvement of accessibility and sustainable practices, the park has developed the site, and increased its appeal on the global scale. While conservation policy can sometimes subordinate the environment and local interests in the favor of promoting tourism, that is not the case in Cinque Terre, where there is such large personal investment from the local population.Carrier, James G., West, Page. 2004 Ecotourism and Authenticity. Current Anthropology. 4(4) 483-251. In fact, locals and park representatives work in tandem to understand and adapt to changing tourist needs while mitigating negative environmental consequences. In order to maintain responsible and sustainable tourism within a community, certain criteria must be met. Foremost, the tourism must be culturally appropriate.Charnley, Susan. 2005. From Nature tourism to ecotourism? Human Organization 64(1):75‚Äì88. As a World Heritage Site, Cinque Terre embraces its traditions and culture and expands the tourist experience beyond a hike through the hills. The National Park makes a connection to the place with authentic customs, foods and wines. Second, is the importance of land tenure and connection to the land, which Cinque Terre addresses with lifestyles that depend on both land and water. It is this strong connection to the environment that continues to bring tourists to these towns imbedded perfectly in the coastal hills. Finally, what gives Cinque Terre so much potential for sustainable tourism are the local benefits that stretch beyond economics. As tourism is now so ingrained in the towns, the social benefits of interaction are evident and foster a sense of empowerment and pride that comes with caring for a protected land that millions enjoy. Management and development Trail management The Blue Path, the most popular hiking trail in the park, between Vernazza and Monterosso al Mare The presence of trails that are safe and accessible while minimizing soil erosion is vital for a National Park, particularly one whose typology is as extreme as Cinque Terre. A direct result of the heavy crowds during the summer months, Cinque Terre trails, spanning almost 12 miles are in constant need of supervision, as both soil degradation and human safety are real concerns.Marion Jeffery, L., Leung, Yu-Fai. 2004 Environmentally Sustainable Trail Management. Environmental Impacts of Ecotourism. Ecotourism book series, volume 2. Wallingford, Oxon, GBR: CABI Publishing. The absence of adequate control can have effects ranging in severity from vegetation loss to major soil erosion. Environmentally sustainable trail management relies on proper oversight that can include an inventory and evaluation of existing trails and grades, set standards for accessibility and closures when weather or other natural conditions deem appropriate. In evaluating trails, it is important to assess intended recreational uses: the extent to which particular paths will be used and the difficulty of said trails. While the best trails are those that are designed, like many other parks, Cinque Terre relies more on visitor created paths or those that are originally the result of local necessity. For instance, the Via dell‚ÄôAmore is a footpath that was originally built by railroad workers in 1926‚Äì1928 for convenience between stations. In addition, to counteract the steep topography of the hills, the park relies on hillside trail construction, stone retaining walls and steps to maintain sustainable footpaths.Marion Jeffery, L., Leung, Yu-Fai. 2004 Environmentally Sustainable Trail Management. Environmental Impacts of Ecotourism. Ecotourism book series, volume 2. Wallingford, Oxon, GBR: CABI Publishing. Development In moving forward to improve and sustainably manage the park, an evaluation of tourist demands and projects that respond to those needs are essential. In collaboration with the Italian government, UNESCO has launched a pilot project to implement Management Plans that will provide guidelines for the sites listed in the World Heritage List before 2002, hoping to eventually expand the project to all other National Heritage sites. Specifically for Cinque Terre, the park foresees as its goals the management of tourist flow, preservation of land, an increase of the market for local products and, subsequently, an expansion of the local economy. The analysis considers \\"attributes\\" such as the landscape, accessibility, services, type of cookery and cost, and tourist perceptions of these factors. In regards to the landscape attribute, a negative connotation was connected to \\"mixed cultivation\\", suggesting that the main draw for tourists is the appreciation of the natural landscape, and less so the tradition that is tied to terraced vineyards. As many of the terraces are now degraded, steps such as the \\"Uncultivated Lands\\" initiative are essential in raising interest in this area. Analyzing accessibility, tourists showed interest in the current \\"system using trains for transportation\\" as a convenience, but were less supportive of \\"strengthening of the train system\\", implying that while the current system is appreciated, further development that would take away from the natural environment would be detrimental. These examples provide an interesting tool for both the park and UNESCO in moving Cinque Terre and other similar sites to a better and more sustainable state. Unfortunately, tourism in the Mediterranean is seasonal, and heavy surges of visitors in the summer months overload the natural resources over the course of a very short time and crowd- control and limiting trail hours which would minimize the impact of heavy foot traffic are options that are still being perfected. In the off-season, some businesses are virtually abandoned, creating an economic imbalance that is difficult to adjust to. In response, the National Park has tried to draw tourist attention to other aspects of the towns. While there is great success of the \\"Cinque Terre Card\\" that allows access to the trails, potential additions of the \\"Education Card\\" (granting access to museums and laboratory activities) and the \\"Health Card\\" (which promotes natural alternative medicine such as naturopathy and plantar reflexology) are met with less enthusiasm. In either case, ecotourism development is desirable in leading the industry in a more sustainable direction. The MQA Project The Marchio di Qualit√† Ambientale (Environmental Quality Brand) is a project whose aim is to minimize the impact of man on the environment by promoting sustainable tourism. The initiative is aimed at tourist-sector businesses on a voluntary basis, the hope being that services that have the potential to safeguard the environment do so through business practices.Parco Nazionale delle Cinque Terre 2012 What is the MQA- Marchio di Qualit√† Ambientale? http://www.parconazionale5terre.it It is a partnership between the National Park and local business owners, establishing a relationship between socio-economic development interest and environmental protection. Protected Marine Area The Protected Marine Area was founded in 1997 and preludes the National Park as an effort to protect and maintain proper usage of the sea off the coast of Cinque Terre. It is subdivided into 3 zones, a Strict Nature Reserve, where boaters are prohibited, the General Nature Reserve, which allows access to motor boats, registered retail fishermen and guided scuba diving tours and the last and least stringent Partial Nature Reserve that allows monitored recreational fishing. Pelagos Sanctuary This part of the Ligurian Sea is included in the Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean marine mammals, an international protected area that includes territories of France, Monaco and Italy.Notarbartolo-Di-Sciara, G, T Agardy, D Hyrenbach, T Scovazzi, and P Van Klaveren. 2008 The Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean Marine Mammals. Aquatic Conservation-marine and Freshwater Ecosystems 18.4:367‚Äì391. Founded in 2002, The Pelagos Sanctuary focuses on the protection of Mediterranean cetaceans under threat from human involvement. In Italy, past practices included deep- net fishing and pollution from cruise ships that dock in areas like Cinque Terre, endangering the habitats of dolphins and other cetaceans that live in its waters. Goals are aimed at the protection of Pelagos cetaceans and their habitats and food ecosystems as well as the general biodiversity of the Mediterranean coast. The coast along the Cinque Terre is characterized by high cliffs, caves, bays, tiny beaches and cleft rocks. Marine life in the stretch of the coast which extends from Punta Mesco at Monterosso to Capo Montenegro at Riomaggiore is rich and varied. The steep faces of the cliffs under water and the shallows and isolated rocks are populated by various kinds of gorgonia (sea fans), such as the colorful Leptogorgia sarmentosa and the white Eunicella verrucosa, a rare species in the Mediterranean, but fairly common along this part of the coast. The Posidonia oceanica, a plant that creates very important grass-like colonies, grows here and provides a safe habitat for the reproduction of many organisms. The steep rock faces of Punta Mesco and Capo Montenegro have the richest forms of marine life including rare species: the Eunicella verrucosa mentioned above, the rare Gerardia savaglia, or black coral. At a depth of only about 15/20 meters at Punta Mesco, unlike the rest of the Mediterranean, it is possible to discover the fans of the Paramuricea clavata or red gorgonia.Alla Porta Rossa Administration The Cinque Terre are composed of five villages: from west to east: * Monterosso al Mare (commune) * Vernazza (commune) * Corniglia (frazione of Vernazza) * Manarola (frazione of Riomaggiore) * Riomaggiore (commune) Other municipalities whose territory is part of the Cinque Terre National Park: * Levanto * La Spezia See also * Ligurian Sea * Province of La Spezia * National parks of Italy References Category:National parks of Italy Category:Parks in Liguria Category:Province of La Spezia Category:World Heritage Sites in Italy ","title":"Cinque Terre National Park"},{"id":"24934400","text":"Human Capital Supply Chain is a book by Tim Giehl and Sara Moss.

Retrieved 30 September 2013. Biography Kershaw is the only son of Florence Kershaw (n√©e Ward) (1916‚Äì2010), a retired school caterer; and Walter Kershaw (1917‚Äì1998), who was in the RAF from 1936 to 1946; at Duxford during the Battle of Britain, retiring as Flight Sergeant. He has two younger sisters. Kershaw attended De la Salle College in Pendleton, Salford, from 1951 to 1958; later as a student at King's College, Durham University (now part of Newcastle University) from 1958 to 1962, graduating with a BA Honours in Fine Art. Kershaw has been twice married and divorced but now has a son and daughter with Gillian Halliwell. Kershaw has always been self-employed and still runs his studio business today. His early large external murals painted on slum properties alongside his provocative public sculptures attracted much media attention in the ‚Äò60s, ‚Äò70s and early ‚Äò80s. For example, interviews with Anna Ford for Granada TV; as a guest of Janet Street Porter on London Weekend TV; Sue McGregor‚Äôs interview for \\"Conversation Piece\\" on BBC Radio 4; and as a guest alongside Eric Morecambe on Russell Harty‚Äôs BBC2 chat show. George Best was a good friend to Kershaw and purchased six large drawings and oil paintings from him, whilst playing at Manchester United; and Bob Monkhouse was very kind to him, purchasing his paintings, corresponding and promoting his work on his BBC Radio 2 show. Ian Potts, now at the BBC and then a student at Regent Street Polytechnic made a film \\"The First Graffiti Artist\\" about Walter's work.

Early life The Monet and Hosched√© families from left to right: Claude Monet, Alice Monet, Jean-Pierre Hosched√©, Jacques Hosched√©, Blanche Hosched√©, Jean Monet, Michel Monet, Martha Hosched√©, Germaine Hosched√©, Suzanne Hosched√© Ernest and Alice Hosched√© Blanche Hosched√© was born in Paris, the second daughter of Ernest Hosched√© and Alice Hosched√©. Ernest was a businessman, a department store magnate in Paris. He collected impressionist paintingsStreet Singer Provenance Information. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Retrieved August 27, 2014. and was an important patron to Claude Monet early in his career. In 1876, he commissioned Claude Monet to paint decorative panels in the round drawing room, in his residence, the ch√¢teau de Rottembourg, in Montgeron. In 1877, Ernest Hosched√© went bankrupt and his art collection was auctioned off. Life with the Monets Ernest Hosched√©, Alice, and their six children moved into a house in V√©theuil with Monet, his wife Camille, and their two sons, Jean and the infant Michel. Ernest, however, spent most of his time in Paris, and eventually went to Belgium. After the death of Camille in V√©theuil on 5 September 1879, Alice and her children continued living with Monet. In 1881, they moved to Poissy, and finally settled in their home in Giverny in 1883. Although Ernest and Alice Hosched√© never divorced, Claude Monet and Alice went on living together until after the death of Ernest in 1891. Claude Monet and Alice Hosched√© got married on 16 July 1892. Education The only child in the Hosched√©-Monet household to become interested in art, Blanche began painting at the age of eleven and developed a fond relationship with Claude Monet. She visited his studio as well as √âdouard Manet's. By the time she was 17 years old, she was Monet's assistant and only student, often painting en plein air alongside him, painting the same subject with the same colors. Blanche also painted alongside American expatriates Theodore Earl Butler and John Leslie Breck. Monet stopped the romance that had developed between Blanche and Breck, while he allowed Butler to marry Blanche‚Äôs sister, Suzanne Hosched√©, in 1892. The art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel purchased a Haystack painting by Blanche, and it currently is displayed in Monet‚Äôs house in Giverny. In January 1888, while in Antibes, Monet encouraged Blanche to submit a work to the Salon. Jean and Claude Monet Blanche married Claude Monet‚Äôs eldest son, Jean Monet, in 1897. The couple lived in Rouen, where Jean worked as a chemist for his uncle L√©on Monet, and until 1913 in Beaumont-le- Roger. Her mother, Alice, died on 19 May 1911, and Jean on 10 February 1914, after a long illness. Overcome with grief, Claude Monet suffered from depression and, from that point on, Blanche took over her father-in-law's household. She watched over him as his eyesight was failing him to the point he believed he was going blind. Georges Clemenceau, their common friend, called her Monet's \\"Blue Angel\\". After Monet's death on 5 December 1926, and for twenty years until her own in 1947, she took on the responsibility of the house and gardens at Giverny. She died in Nice, aged 82. Career Blanche Hosched√© Monet, Grainstack or Haystack, 1889 Most of Blanche's works were done in Giverny from 1883 to 1897, which was similar to that of Monet's work, and around Rouen. She \\"adopted an almost pure form of impressionism.\\" She painted landscapes with trees such as pines and poplars, and meadows along the Risle river. In the 1920s, she also painted on several occasions at Georges Clemenceau's property in Saint-Vincent-sur-Jard (Vend√©e department) in the west of France - paintings of the garden, house and the Atlantic Ocean. After Monet's death, she remained in Giverny and continued painting. Recognizing her body of work, a street bears her name in the village of Giverny.

In a chapter on Blanche and Monet in Source: Nature's Healing Role in Art and Writing (2009), Burke comments, \\"Given the sheer scale of the surfaces to be covered in the Grandes D√©corations, it is logical to consider Monet had an assistant, and who better than Blanche?\\" Exhibitions Solo exhibitions * 1927 - Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, Paris: Blanche Hosched√© (November 7‚Äì18, 1927) * 1931 - Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, Paris: Blanche Hosched√© Monet (March 9‚Äì20, 1931) * 1942 - Galerie Daber, Paris: Blanche Hosched√© ( October 16- November 7, 1942) * 1947 - Galerie d‚Äôart Drouot Provence, Paris: Blanche Hosched√© Monet (March 14- April 14, 1947) Group exhibitions * Many times between 1905 and 1954 - Salon des Ind√©pendants * Many times between 1907 and 1935 - Salon de la Soci√©t√© des Artistes Rouennais * 1954 - Galerie Zak, Paris, November 19-December 3, 1954. * 1928 - Galerie Georges Petit, Catalogue des ≈ìuvres importantes Camille Pissarro et de tableaux, pastels, aquarelles, dessins, gouaches par Mary Cassatt, C√©zanne, √âdouard Dufeu, Delacroix, Guillaumin, Blanche Hosched√©, Jongkind, Le Bail, Luce, Manet, Claude Monet, Piette, Seurat, Signac, Sisley, van Rysselberghe, etc.. * 1957 - Vernon, Blanche-Hosched√©-Monet * 1959 - Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Rouen: Blanche Hosched√© Monet, Henry Ottman * 1960 - Charles E.

Life He was the seventh son of Benjamin Bathurst, younger brother of Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst, born at Brackley, Northamptonshire, on 16 October 1744. He was educated at Winchester College, and New College, Oxford. He became rector of Witchingham in Norfolk; in 1775 was made canon of Christ Church, Oxford; and in 1795 prebendary of Durham Cathedral. In 1805, on the translation of Charles Manners-Sutton to Canterbury, he was consecrated bishop of Norwich. Bathurst died in London, on 5 April 1837, and was buried at Great Malvern. For many he years was considered to be the only \\"liberal\\" bishop in the House of Lords, and he supported Catholic emancipation. Bathurst was privately critical of the blood expended by the British in fighting Napoleon and in 1815 he and his son (just appointed his archdeacon at Norwich) attacked the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty in France. Like his Norfolk friend Thomas W Coke (\\"Coke of Holkham\\") he admired Napoleon as an enlightened ruler and regretted his exile. In 1835, when over ninety years of age, he went to the house to vote in support of Lord Melbourne's government. Although frequently considered to have been a rather ineffectual diocesan and to have had a lax ordination standard, ordaining men rejected by other bishops, recent work has suggested that he had firm opinions on what made a man fit for ordination and preferred to dealt with applications on a case-by-case basis, instead of applying blanket admission criteria which sometimes excluded deserving and promising candidates. Family The bishop married Grace, a daughter of Charles Coote, dean of Kilfenora, and brother of Sir Eyre Coote. The union produced eight sons and three daughters.Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle, Volume 43 His eldest son, Henry Bathurst, was fellow of New College, Oxford, became chancellor of the church of Norwich in 1805; held the rectories of Oby (1806), North Creake (1809), and Hollesley (1828); and was appointed archdeacon of Norwich in 1814. He wrote Memoirs of the late Dr. Henry Bathurst, Lord Bishop of Norwich, 1837; he issued in 1842 a supplement, with additional letters of his father, entitled An Easter Offering for the Whigs . . . being a Supplement to the Memoirs of the late Bishop of Norwich, 1842, in which he concentrated criticism on the injustice of the Whig party in refusing to promote his father to a richer see. Archdeacon Bathurst died 10 September 1844. His second son, Lieut.-Gen. Sir James Bathurst, was a military commander. The bishop's third son, Benjamin Bathurst went missing in 1809 in Germany, and is believed to have been murdered; his elder daughter, Tryphena Bathurst Thistlethwayte, rewrote her father's memoirs from her eldest brother's papers. His youngest daughter Caroline de Crespigny (1797-1861) was a poet and for many years a close confidante of Shelley's cousin and biographer Thomas Medwin.Ernest J Lovell, Jr, Captain Medwin; Friend of Byron and Shelley, University of Texas, 1962 pages 303-306 References Attribution Category:1744 births Category:1837 deaths Category:Bishops of Norwich Henry Category:Alumni of New College, Oxford ","title":"Henry Bathurst (bishop)"},{"id":"24934661","title":"Villain Entertainment"},{"id":"24934666","text":"Face Oculta (Hidden Face) is a Portuguese nationwide political corruption, money-laundering and corporate tax evasion scandal, first noticed in October 2009.

The encyclopaedia of ephemera: a guide to the fragmentary documents of everyday life for the collector, curator, and historian. Routledge. p. 103. The character survived until the 1960s with several artists drawing newspaper strips and the varied annuals. Such was his popularity that other newspapers created their own cartoon characters, the Daily Express with Rupert Bear and the Daily Mirror with Pip, Squeak and Wilfred. The Folkard era The first variant of Teddy Tail was drawn by Charles Folkard (1878‚Äì1963) who wrote and illustrated Teddy Tail from 1915 until 1926. https://www.lambiek.net/artists/f/folkard_charles.htmTeddy Tail is always seen with a knot in his tail.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/f/folkard_charles.htm Only from reading his first 1915 published Annual The Adventures of Teddy Tail of The Daily Mail do you see his tail is knotted purposely to help his friend Dr. Beetle (a quack) escape from a hole he had fallen into. As quoted from the first book: > \\"Then a dreadful thing happened. We couldn't get the knot undone. I don't > think much of Dr. Beetle as a Doctor. He oiled and patted it, but it was no > good. My beauty has gone for ever.\\" Teddy Tail continued with several stories based on Children's Nursery Rhymes and historical events as well as fairy tales that were popular at the time. There were several annuals or books printed in the years before his 1933 revival, which were reprinted from the Daily Mail cartoon strips. The story that followed between the first published book and the second was never republished, only the 84 remaining newspaper cartoon strip clippings show the story between running from the Cat at the end of the first book and meeting the Noah's at the start of the 'In Nursery Rhyme Land' book. The Looking Glass Annual also published a Teddy Tail story. This featured the Folkard drawings and story text adapted from the newspaper strips. This is the only appearance of Teddy Tail in another annual. This was a lesser-known children's annual from c1924-26 that featured a glass mirror inset into the front cover and was published by Middleton Publications, London. The Teddy Tail story appears in the last one from c. 1926 in the 'boy with a monocle' cover edition. Folkard left the paper soon after, and the strip concluded its first incarnation. The Foxwell era In April 1933 Teddy Tail was revived by the Daily Mail, with new drawings by Herbert Sydney Foxwell (1890‚Äì1943) https://www.lambiek.net/artists/f/foxwell_herbert.htmwho was already known as a cartoon illustrator having drawn Tiger Tim since the mid-1920s for the Amalgamated Press, later known as Fleetway. Tiger Tim had been part of the Bruin Boys since the early 1900s and featured in the Playbox annual since 1910 as well as his own annual since 1922. This second incarnation of Teddy Tail drew him as a schoolboy aged character and was aimed more at younger readers. He was part of a family group that lived in the village of Whiskertown including the 'Whisker Pets' which were looked after by Mrs Whisker, an adult mouse. Piggy the pig, Kitty Puss the cat and Dougie the duck. https://www.lambiek.net/artists/f/foxwell_herbert.htm Teddy Tail annuals were issued from 1933 to 1940. Merchandising, following similar successes with Mickey Mouse were popular, such items as small toys, cut-outs, jigsaws and Teddy Tail biscuits were made. The 'Teddy Tail League' was started also in 1933 https://www.lambiek.net/artists/f/foxwell_herbert.htm, which involved members receiving enamel badges, birthday cards and free advice on Pets or Hobbies, similar to the Pip, Squeak and Wilfred and Bobby Bear clubs. Special events and public activities were announced in the Daily Mail. In the 1936 Annual, mention is made of \\"750,000 members\\". You had to collect six 'seals' from the Daily Mail newspaper to enrol and get the badge and Membership rules card and learn of Teddy Tail's 'secret sign'. You could add 12 more 'seals' to get the Sports Badge according to the 1934 annual. Foxwell died whilst on service in 1943https://www.lambiek.net/artists/f/foxwell_herbert.htm , bringing an end to the series until 1949. Later revivals In 1949, Teddy Tail was revived with illustrators Arthur ‚ÄòSpot‚Äô Potts https://www.lambiek.net/artists/p/potts_arthur.htm, Tony Hawes (1929‚Äì1997) and William St. John Glenn (1904‚Äì1974) drawing him. This time he was very anthropomorphised being now a skinny human type character in the vein of Bugs Bunny and the redesigned Mickey Mouse, but still generally similar to the Foxwell creation. The annuals were issued from 1949 to c.1962. Annuals There were several undated annuals featuring the first version of Teddy Tail. These follow an order as proved by the story continuity and those as shown in adverts in the back of the later prints of the books. They are as shown below in the order of issuing.

They swarm in springs, small streams, lakes, and in some places the margins of rivers. They are most abundant southward, becoming rarer and local toward the northern borders of their range. Chilina gibbosa and Chilina fluminea are medically important, because they transfer parasites causing dermatitis.

He is a consultant ophthalmic surgeon and head of the Corneoplastic unit, Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead. Education and early career Born on 13 September 1968 at Isleworth, Middlesex, UK, Malhotra attended Hazelwick School, Crawley. He graduated in medicine and surgery from the University of Bristol in 1993 and was a demonstrator in anatomy at the University from 1994 to 1995. Having finished his basic surgical ophthalmic training at The Western Eye Hospital, London, he went on to complete his higher surgical training in Oxford. He was a Fellow in oculoplastic, orbital and lacrimal surgery at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and Women and Children's Hospital, Adelaide, Australia from 2002 to 2003. In 2003 he was appointed as consultant ophthalmic and oculoplastic surgeon at the Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead. Developments Malhotra has developed two instruments used in endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR): *The Malhotra endonasal nibbler *The Malhotra endonasal punch The nibbler reduces the need for powered instruments such as drills and burrs during endonasal DCR and is estimated therefore to save ¬£100 in costs for each procedure. In 2005, Malhotra was heavily involved in a case that was given considerable international coverage. Sundeep Hunjan, then 23, was attacked with acid on her way home in Nairobi. She suffered extensive burns, including loss of her eyelids. She was operated on at the specialist McIndoe Surgical Centre in East Grinstead, where Malhotra rebuilt her upper and lower eyelids. There is a happy ending. After some two years of treatment, she made a full recovery and in 2007 married Amritpal Singh Rupra. In May 2010, she gave birth to a boy. In 2007, Malhotra received the American Academy of Ophthalmology Achievement Award. In 2008, Malhotra created a method of treating Blepharospasm using filters. In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Malhotra was cited in the Tatler Beauty & Cosmetic Surgery Guides as one of Britain's top cosmetic surgeonshttp://ramanmalhotra.com/images/tatler2008.jpg  accessdate=29 October 2014.http://ramanmalhotra.com/PDFs/Tatler2009.pdf  accessdate=29 October 2014.http://ramanmalhotra.com/PDFs/Tatler2009mainpage.pdf  accessdate=29 October 2014.http://ramanmalhotra.com/PDFs/TatlerApril2010.pdf  accessdate=29 October 2014. In 2010, Malhotra helped evolve the technique of ptosis (droopy eyelid) surgery and reported a technique (a less disruptive modification of previously described techniques) in the British Journal of Ophthalmology and The Open Ophthalmology Journal. Malhotra sits on the editorial board of Orbit, the international journal of the European Society of Ophthalmic, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.http://informahealthcare.com/page/EditorialAdvisoryBoard?journalCode=orb& In August 2011, he was appointed a section editor of the British Journal of Ophthalmology. In September 2011, Malhotra received a Bronze National Clinical Excellence Award.http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@ab/documents/digitalasset/dh_130247.pdf In 2013, Malhotra developed the Malhotra platinum segment chain for improving eyelid closure in facial palsy. In 2014, Malhotra developed the CADS Ophthalmic Grading score for facial palsy. This is a method to standardise grading of severity of ophthalmic involvement in facial palsy. In February 2015, Malhotra received The Koornneef Award from the Dutch Orbital Society. Also in 2015, Malhotra reported on the post-levator aponeurosis fat pad, a layer of fat in the eyelid not previously recognised by anatomy textbooks. In late 2015, Malhotra was awarded a Silver National Clinical Excellence Award by the Advisory Committee on Clinical Excellence Awards at the Department of Health.

It is considered an economically important species in the Indo-West Pacific, especially in India. Distribution This sea snail is found widely spread in the Indo-West Pacific, and occurs from east to South Africa, including Mozambique, Tanzania, Madagascar, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Oman, Aldabra, Chagos and Mauritius. It also occurs in eastern Polynesia, southern Japan, New Caledonia and Queensland in Australia. Shell description C. ramosus has a large, solid, very rugged and heavy shell, of up to 330 mm in length. It has a relatively globose outline, possessing a short spire, a slightly inflated body whorl, and a moderately long siphonal canal. One of its most striking ornamentations are the conspicuous, leaf-like, recurved hollow digitations. It also presents three spinose axial varices per whorl, with two elongated nodes between them. The shell is coloured white to light brown externally, with a white aperture, generally pink towards the inner edge, the outer lip and the columella. Ecology Habitat The Ramose murex inhabits sandy and rubble bottoms near coral reefs, to depths of around 10 m. Feeding habits Live Chicoreus ramosus. As is the case in other Muricidae, C. ramosus is a carnivorous predatory species, usually feeding on bivalves and other gastropods. References * Kilburn, R.N. & Rippey, E.

He was married to the soprano Adelina Stehle. One of the most important Italian tenors of his day, Garbin created, inter alia, tenor roles in Alberto Franchetti's Cristoforo Colombo, Fenton in Verdi's last opera Falstaff (1893), and Milio in Leoncavallo's Zaz√†; in 1917, in Rome, he appeared in the world premiere of Renzo Bianchi's Gismonda alongside Ida Quaiatti and Domenico Viglione Borghese. His success in Anglo-Saxon countries (such as England) was (put charitably) limited (he was, by The Times, described as \\"miserable\\" as Cavaradossi at Covent Garden in 1908); but in the Latin sphere (South America and Italy) he was in constant demand until his retirement in 1918. He recorded for G&T; (to become HMV) in 1903, Fonotipia and Columbia; his recordings for the two last mentioned companies sold very well, and are easily found. According to Scott (Record of Singing 1978) his best record of all is the E un riso gentil from Leoncavallo's Zaza. Garbin represents a \\"half-way-house\\" between the older bel canto school and the new verist style. Garbin's style (according to Steane ‚Äì The Grand Tradition 1971) is a curious mix of the frail and explosive. At his death, in 1943, Edoardo Garbin was the last male solo vocal artist to have created a part and worked with Giuseppe Verdi ‚Äì some fifty years' previously in the composer's Fastaff of 1893.

Slackistan was released in the UK in 2010, and has also played at a number of festivals, in such locations as London, Abu Dhabi, New York City, San Francisco and Goa. It has been banned in Pakistan.

According to The Guardian, the CBFC objects to the movie because it has swear words in English and Urdu, and \\"contains the words 'Taliban' and 'lesbian'. Scenes showing characters drinking (fake alcohol for the filming, incidentally) and a joke about beards (as in, 'my beard is longer than your beard') made between characters talking hypothetically about a fancy dress party. These are not the CBFC's only objections, but the main ones it has highlighted.\\" The CBFC have also stated that, even if all cuts are made as demanded, the film would still receive a restrictive adults-only ‚Äò18+‚Äô rating.\\" In a press release, director Hammad Khan stated ‚ÄúThe censor board‚Äôs verdict is oppressive, arbitrary and steeped in denial about life outside their government offices. Maybe the establishment‚Äôs view is that young Pakistanis saying words like 'Taliban' and 'Lesbian' represent potent threat. Members of the Slackistan cast have publicly expressed their disagreement with the CBFC's decision. ‚ÄúThis objection honestly reinforces the feeling of being voiceless that seems to be lingering in the country these days. We really are stripped of our basic right to express ourselves,‚Äù actress Shahana Khan Khalil said. ‚ÄúI also find it highly hypocritical for our cinemas to be allowed to show both Hollywood and Bollywood films that depict everything and a lot more are never banned by the censor board.‚Äù Actor Shahbaz Shigri said, ‚ÄúWe [in Pakistan] haven‚Äôt developed the ability to scrutinize ourselves. We point fingers at others rather than correcting ourselves. We don‚Äôt laugh at ourselves. This limits our film industry and young film makers that will never get through to the right channels.‚Äù The CBFC's own website states that it prevents the public exhibition of films that break certain vague rules, which include \\"giving offense to any section of the public or injured the feelings of any class of persons\\" or \\"ridiculing, disparaging or attacking any religious sect caste and creed.\\" Music The original soundtrack consists of music by The Kominas, Mole, Zerobridge and others.

He was the first to publish much of Francis Bacon's private correspondence. Life Born in 1665, Robert Stephens was the fourth son of Richard Stephens of the elder house of that name at Eastington in Gloucestershire, by his wife Anne, eldest daughter of Sir Hugh Cholmeley, bart. His first education was at Wotton school, whence he removed to Lincoln College, Oxford, matriculating on 19 May 1681, but he left the university without taking a degree.DNB cites Foster, Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, iv. 1420 He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1689, and was one of the founders of the Society of Antiquaries in 1717.DNB cites Archaeologia, vol, i. p. xxxvii Being a relative of Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, whose mother, Abigail, was daughter of Nathaniel Stephens of Eastington, he was preferred by him to be chief solicitor of the customs, in which employment he continued till 1726, when he was appointed to succeed Thomas Madox in the place of historiographer-royal. He died at Grovesend, near Thornbury, Gloucestershire, on 9 Nov. 1732,DNB cites Gentleman's Magazine, 1732, p. 1082 and was buried at Eastington, where a monument with an English inscription was erected to his memory by his widow (and first cousin), Mary Stephens, daughter of Sir Hugh Cholmeley, 4th Baronet.DNB cites Bigland, Gloucestershire, i. 541 Work Stephens began about 1690 to transcribe and collect unpublished \\"letters and memoirs\\" of Francis Bacon, chiefly in collections. The first result of his labours was his Letters of Sir Francis Bacon published in London in 1702.Letters of Sr Francis Bacon . . . written during the Reign of King James the First. Now collected and augmented with several Letters and Memoires . . . never before published. The whole being illustrated by an Historical Introduction, London, 1702, 4to. After this volume had appeared Harley \\"was pleased to put into my hands some neglected manuscripts and loose papers, to see whether any of the Lord Bacon's compositions lay concealed there that were fit to be published.\\" His investigations induced Stephens to prepare another volume, Letters and Remains of the Lord Chancellor Bacon.Letters and Remains of the Lord Chancellor Bacon, London, 1734, 4to. Reissued in 1736 as: Letters, Memoirs, Parliamentary Affairs, Slate Papers, &c.;, with some Curious Pieces in Law and Philosophy. Published from the Originals. . . . With an Account of the Life of Lord Bacon. The first 231 pages of this volume (it consists of 516), with a preface and introductory memoir, were sent to press by Stephens. The rest were selected from his papers by his friend John Locker, and the whole volume was edited by Stephens's widow. Among Stephens's collection in the British Library (Addit. MS. 4269) is a catalogue of letters and papers connected with Bacon. Many of these documents cannot now be found, and a list of the missing papers is printed in Spedding, Ellis and Heath's edition of Bacon's Works, 1874, xiv. 590. It is possible that they are still in existence, and may yet be recovered. All the letters and papers described in Stephens's 'Catalogue' were most probably in the hands of Archbishop Tenison at Lambeth as late as December 1682.

The more recent outbreak of another bark beetle pest, the spruce beetle, is threatening higher-elevation forests of Engelmann spruce. Chemical prevention is effective but too costly for large-scale use. Dead trees increase the incidence of wildfires, and may contribute to climate change as they decay. Uses have been found for the dead wood including composting and in construction, and potentially to make biochar. Statistics Mountain pine beetles infest the lodgepole pine, which makes up 8% of Colorado's of forests. Lodgepole pines are found at elevations between . A previous notable outbreak occurred in Colorado in the 1970s but was significantly less detrimental than the current infestation. Of the of lodgepole pine, about 70% have been damaged. High temperatures have allowed beetle infestations at higher elevations. According to a recent study, pine beetles have expanded their infestation by . The infestation is primarily concentrated in the state's northern mountains. The infestation has been moving north and east from the Granby and Winter Park area towards Larimer County. It is estimated that beetle kill will leave behind a deforested area the size of Rhode Island. The Colorado State Forest Service releases an annual report entitled Report on the Health of Colorado's Forests. The most recent survey, published in January 2017, presented the following statistics: * One in 14 trees are dead in Colorado forests * The number of gray-brown standing-dead trees has increased 30 percent since 2010 to 834 million * Colorado's mountain pine beetle epidemic killed trees across 3.4 million acres * The continuing spruce beetle epidemic has killed trees across 1.7 million acres Uses of beetle killed wood Although beetle kill has resulted in a significant amount of dead trees, there are some options for use of the trees after they are killed. For instance, Summit County has begun composting by combining wood chips from beetle kill trees with other organic materials. By doing this, they are creating a product that could be used in landscaping and re-vegetation projects. The ancient practice of biochar is also emerging as an option. A product of the bio char process is a synthetic gas that can be used as fuel. Some forestry experts predict this fuel can be used to power plants where beetle kill wood is processed. Beetle kill wood is also being used in local projects. Multiple housing complexes are beginning to use beetle kill wood to replace the siding of houses, like a condo complex at Copper Mountain which is replacing old siding with blue-stain wood, which is named for the dark color in the wood that is caused by fungus carried by the pine beetle. Snowboards, skis and guitars are also being crafted from beetle kill pine.https://www.outsideonline.com/1921621/making-best-beetle-kill-new- gear The Beetle Kill Trade Association has been established to ‚Äúto unite and align the self interests of business invested in or interested in the removal and recycling of standing beetle killed lodgepole pines in order to remove obstacles to the creation of a viable, vibrant and sustainable market for products utilizing beetle kill pines as raw material.‚Äù Prevention There are different views regarding beetle kill in Colorado. Some view it as a natural cycle while others believe it should be prevented. Unfortunately, such prevention measures are very expensive and not practical. Chemical treatments applied to lodgepole pines in the spring is effective, but the costs are $50 per tree in addition to annual treatments as needed. Werner Kurz has pointed out that hundreds of millions of tons of carbon will be released into the atmosphere as the dead timber decays or burns, contributing to climate change that may further devastate Western forests. He advocates logging most of the dead trees and replanting quickly.http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2008/04/23/tech-beetle- carbon.htmlhttp://e360.yale.edu/feature/megadrought_in_us_southwest_a_bad_omen_for_forests_globally/2665/ See also *Rocky Mountain bark beetle infestation References *Colorado State Forest Service  Annual Report on the Health of Colorado‚Äôs Forests  January 2017 *Berwyn, Bob.

Rasul Amin was son of a prominent khan of the Amin tribe. His mother, Hera Amin was also from Watapore District from Nanikhel tribe). He was a great nephew of Ghazi Mir Zaman Khan. He was raised as an orphan, because his mother died when he was 5 years old. His personality was self made, and that made him positive throughout his life. His father, Amin Khan participated in the uprising with the leading attorney general, Ghazi Mir Zaman Khan in 1947. Due to the bad government he was forced to depart with Ghazi Mir Zaman Khan to Herat and Mazar-e Sharif. Rasul completed his primary education in Kunar.http://larawbar.com/details.php?id=13974&date;=2009-10-31&author;= In 1955, he went to Peshawar, Pakistan where he wanted to desire further more studies and gather his English and Urdu languages.

In 1960, he was admitted to Islamia College Peshawar, Pakistan. He was elected as a General-Secretary of the Khyber Union, (students‚Äô union), in 1962, a unique, unprecedented honour for an Afghan student. In 1963, he was voted the best debater at college. He received a BA in 1964 and a double master's degree in Sociology, English and Political Science in 1966.http://individual.com/story.php?story=109398911 Soviet resistance From 1980 to 1985 he worked with the National Islamic Front of Pir Sayed Ahmad Gillani in Peshawar. 1990s, he worked with the Rome Group that was established by the former King, Muhammad Zaher Shah. He initially worked with the renowned Afghan intellectual Professor Seyyed Bahauddin Majrooh at the Afghanistan Information Centre (AIC). The AIC became a respected mouthpiece of liberal Afghan intellectuals linked to the resistance but drew the wrath of the fundamentalist factions. Prof. Majrooh was assassinated in Peshawar in 1988 after the AIC had published the results of a poll among Afghan refugees that showed that the former King was the most popular Afghan politician, way ahead of the mujahedin leaders. On 21 March 1985, Rasul established the Organization Writers Union of Free Afghanistan, which, as the AIC, was supported by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation (Germany), USIS, the Asia Foundation (USA), and the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Denmark). Like the AIC, it became a renowned institution that ‚Äì amongst other activities ‚Äì collected documents on the Afghan resistance, one of the few to do so. He was one of the great politicians and a well known scholar of Afghanistan. He dedicated his entire life for helping his Afghanistan milat and had dream of seeing a united afghan people. Professor had written tens of books and magazines about literature, culture and sociology. He was the first author of English, Pashto and Dari language, in Asia, Africa around the world. Civil war In 1990 Rasul Amin warned that 'If the United States cuts or reduces its aid to the Afghan cause, it will be replaced by the Arabs. Afghanistan would not be at peace for a long time.' Amin's prediction came true when in the 90s the US and the Soviet left a power vacuum and a civil war broke out where the warring factions were all supported by one of Afghans neighbour countries. Rasul Amin, one of the most notable Afghan Scholars, at that time always kept an automatic rifle behind his chair and a pistol on his desk. In 1996 he said about that Afghan Civil War \\"This is not truly an Afghan fight. Only a few people who want power sell themselves to foreigners.\\" Post-Taliban Afghanistan Rasul also played an important role in Rome Conference held in 2001 under the supervision of former king Mohammad Zahir Shah. After the fall of the Taliban regime, Prof. Amin returned to Afghanistan. At the Bonn conference, he was appointed Minister of Education in the Interim Administration of Afghanistan, representing the Rome Group. When the new school year was opened in March 2002, he said: We have decided to project a new image of ourselves. We have to forget the past if we want to rebuild this country.‚ÄôDuring his ministry he visited Japan and met with Emperor of Japan. Professor Rasul Amin organized peace conference, seminars and workshops for Afghanistan.

A lot of other scholars and prominent figures was invited on this Peace conference . Professor was very popular and famous in a group of friends. Louis Dupree and his wife, Nancy Hatch Dupree and Christina Eckerly was very close friends of him. In 2001, Rasul Amin became the first Education Minister of Afghanistan. He stated that Afghan girls be given priority in their education and said, \\"there was a big task to rebuild his homeland (Afghanistan) education system after 24 years of unrest\\". That was his \\"to do\\" list in his early days as Afghanistan education minister. He was so committed to fulfill his duties. He was posted in 2002 and he resigned. He decided to devote himself fully to the intellectual regeneration of Afghanistan and to Afghan-Pak friendship. The 2004 article ‚ÄòResolving the Afghan-Pakistan Border Question‚Äô is only one in a long list of his writings. Prof. Amin established the Afghanistan Study Centre in Kabul as the successor of the Writers Union of Free Afghanistan. The founder also became its director and the editor of the Journal of Afghanistan Studies quarterly. He served as the Minister of Education in the interim Transitional Administration under President Hamid Karzai. While being a Minister of Education, he looked after orphan homes, schools etc. He really wanted that woman of Afghanistan should be educated.

They are the remainder of an original group of 11 built in 1861, when the area was originally being developed due to the extension of rail transit into it. As a result, they are among the oldest townhouses on the Upper East Side. Some of them have been added onto, and the two easternmost were combined into a single unit. They retain enough historical integrity that they were designated a New York City Landmark in 1968,, New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission; April 18, 1968; retrieved November 2, 2009. and were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Buildings The row is located at 157‚Äì165 East 78th, on the north side of the street between Third and Lexington avenues. It is closer to the Lexington intersection at the west end of the block. The neighborhood is residential, consisting of similar, often larger, rowhouses and apartment buildings. It is just outside the Upper East Side Historic District, and on the southern edge of Yorkville. They are on lots wide by deep, although the buildings themselves only cover the front . They are two stories high, with exposed basements giving them the appearance of three and a main entrance below street level. The westernmost house, 157, has had a slate- shingled mansard roof with three gabled dormer windows added. At the east end, 163 and 165 have been combined into one house, with a penthouse on the roof. All the houses share some identical decoration, painted white on the western three and black or unpainted on 163‚Äì65. A brownstone belt course runs across all five between the basement and first story, unpainted on 163‚Äì65. The plain lintels, also brownstone, are similarly decorated. The pressed metal cornice at the roofline is the same on all five, supported by rounded consoles faced in acanthus leaves and decorated with round modillions. It has been painted black on 163‚Äì165 and white on the other three, as have the window muntins. The windows on 157's first story are protected by decorative iron grilles. Its entrance door is glazed rather than painted white. The iron fencing around the terrace is taller than that at 159 next door, and identical to that at 163‚Äì65. History The opening of the New York and Harlem Railroad, supplemented by horse cars of the Third Avenue Railway after 1852 made what was then the village of Yorkville attractive to developers, as its horse cars brought the suburb within commuting distance of the commercial heart of New York, which was still concentrated below 14th Street. The city was already rapidly expanding northward, and wealthy residents had built many large mansions constructed along Fifth Avenue up to 42nd Street. In 1860 few of the streets north of 42nd had been graded. But East 78th was opened that year, and a painter named John Turner bought lots 24‚Äì28. Since land was getting more expensive, the houses were narrower than their Federal and Greek Revival counterparts built earlier in the century; unlike grander row housing built since the 1840s, they continued to use brick instead of the more expensive brownstone. Builder Henry Armstrong erected the original row of 11 on the property as speculative housing the next year, 1861. They found willing buyers for whom the lower costs offset the longer commutes. All were finished within that year, making the five survivors the oldest townhouses on the Upper East Side today, beating out this six at 208-218 East 78th, which were part of an original row of 15 started in 1861 but not finished for four years due to material shortages caused by the Civil War. Later in the 19th century, the mansard roof emblematic of the Second Empire style was added to 157. In 1911 a third story, slightly recessed, was added to the top of 163‚Äì65 and the two separate houses were merged. Later in the 20th century the other houses were demolished to clear the way for the larger apartment buildings now on those lots. The original stoops were removed and the former service entrances became the main ones. There have otherwise been no alterations and all five remain private homes.

His portraits are well regarded, but his theories on art never received the attention he craved. He believed that each note of music represented a colour. He created the first portrait of Charles Edward Stuart, the pretender to the British throne. Hussey has works in the Tate Gallery.Giles Hussey, Tate Gallery. Retrieved November 2009  Life  Hussey was born in 1710 at Marnhull in Dorset, the tenth of thirteen children of John and Mary Hussey. His parents sent him to receive a Catholic education in Douay and St Omer in France. On his return he was apprenticed to Jonathan Richardson to learn the art of portraiture. He then went on to work with Francesco Riari and he assisted in painting bishops in Lincoln Cathedral under the Venetian artist Vincenzo Damini. Damini is credited with saving Hussey from a potentially fatal fall while completing the paintings within porches at the cathedral, and got his reward when the two of them set out for Italy with monies from Hussey's parents. After journeying through France in 1730, where substantial funds were spent, Damini abandoned Hussey in Bologna after taking his property. Hussey was lucky to be adopted by a former ambassador to London, Signor Ghislonzoni, who befriended the painter, who was in Bolgna until 1733, when he left for his original destination of Rome. Charles Edward Stuart ‚Äì The Young Pretender by Hussey In Rome he started to develop his own theories on art whilst working with Ercole Lelli. His intention was to use his knowledge of mathematics to identify what made artistic beauty. He measured many ancient statues and claimed to have found a \\"Harmonic Scale\\" that was important to their beauty and construction. Hussey proposed that the musical notes could be aligned with the colours of the spectrum. Red was meant to indicate \\"A\\" whilst violet was meant to indicate A flat. Nash Court in Marnhull where the Hussey family lived until the 1880s The illustration shows one of the portraits that Hussey made of the \\"Young Pretender\\", Charles Edward Stuart, who was the embodiment of the Catholic cause in England. These portraits were accurate, but were considered to have suffered from Hussey's obsession with his theories. Hussey is credited with being the first British artist to create a portrait of Charles Edward Stuart. The first sitting is thought to have been in 1734 and a number of different versions were produced. The second sitting has been dated to 1737 and shows Charles as a knight in a black suit of armour owned by him. An oil painting of this sketch was reported, but its current location is not known. Hussey went back to England in 1737 to reveal his new theories on art, but they received little attention. To make ends meet he again took to portraiture and was able to include the numismatist Matthew Duane and the Duke of Northumberland amongst his clientele in 1742. The Duke was said to have offered Hussey a room at his house and to also have been willing to fund a servant for him as long as Hussey directed his efforts at the Duke's interest. However Hussey is said to have refused the offer as he was not to be given a Catholic priest as well. Hussey created a third set of drawings of \\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\\" in 1742 although he is thought to have based this on a bust of the prince. Over the next twenty years, Hussey was disappointed to find that his artistic theories received very little attention, and in 1768 he gave up painting entirely. He took to gardening after he inherited the family's property at Marnhull, following the death of his elder brother. In 1787 Hussey's nephew, John Rowe of Beaston House in the parish of Broad Hempston, Devon, in whose house Hussey had been living for several years,Lysons, Daniel & Lysons, Samuel, Magna Britannia, Vol.6, Devonshire, London, 1822 changed his name to Hussey and inherited Hussey's wealth and property.Sheila O'Connell, 'Hussey, Giles (1710‚Äì1788)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 2 Nov 2009 Hussey was buried in June 1788 at Broad Hempston in Devon after dying while living away from the artistic community in Beaston House, in the parish of Broad Hempston, the home of his nephew John Rowe.Lysons At the end, Hussey's paintings and drawings commanded high prices. His spectacular detail became valued and drawings of the old and young pretender commanded high prices.

Name origin The strait was named by Captain Daniel Pender in 1868 as part of surveying of the coast, in association with Pearse Island. International boundary Pearse Canal was established as part of the Canada-United States border as part of the outcome of the Alaska boundary dispute with the Hay- Herbert Treaty, otherwise known as the Alaska Boundary Settlement, of January 24, 1903. US claims had included Wales and Pearse Island. Under the terms of the treaty, Pearse Canal along with Tongass Passage (due west of Canada's Wales Island) and the Portland Canal is defined as \\"Portland Channel\\", a term which was established as defining the boundary by the Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1825 but which remained undefined and not on maps until this time. Disputes over the meaning of the term were pivotal to the eventual settlement of the boundary in this region. A varying interpretation maintained the meaning was Clarence Strait, while the original US interpretation interpreted it as south of Wales Island.

After Ufford's death, Maud became a canoness at an Augustinian nunnery, Campsey Priory, in Suffolk. Family and early life Maud was born in about 1310, a daughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster and Maud Chaworth. She had an older sister, Blanche, Baroness Wake of Liddell, and four younger sisters, Joan, Baroness Mowbray, Isabel of Lancaster, prioress of Amesbury, Eleanor, Countess of Arundel, and Mary, Baroness Percy. Her only brother was Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster. His daughter was Blanche of Lancaster, who would in 1359 become the first wife of John of Gaunt, and in 1367 the mother of the future King Henry IV of England. Maud's mother died in 1322, when Maud was twelve years old.  Marriages and Issue  In 1327, Maud married her first husband, William de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster. The couple received a papal dispensation for their marriage, which was dated 1 May 1327. Maud went to live in Ireland with her husband. Together they had one daughter who was born at Carrickfergus Castle in Belfast: * Elizabeth de Burgh, suo jure Countess of Ulster (6 July 1332 ‚Äì 10 December 1363), married Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, by whom she had one daughter, Philippa Plantagenet, 5th Countess of Ulster. In June 1333, Maud's husband was murdered, near Carrickfergus. After his murder, which sparked a civil war in Ireland, Maud fled to England with her infant daughter, who was the suo jure Countess of Ulster, and they lived at the court of King Edward III with the royal family. Due to her knowledge of Irish affairs she had considerable influence in the appointment of Irish officials. Maud married her second husband, Sir Ralph de Ufford, by 8 August 1343. Sir Ralph was the youngest son of Robert de Ufford, Lord Ufford, and Cecily de Valognes. In 1344, he was appointed Justiciar of Ireland, therefore Maud accompanied him in July of that year to Ireland, where she had another daughter: * Maud de Ufford (1345/1346 ‚Äì 25 January 1413), married Thomas de Vere, 8th Earl of Oxford, by whom she had one son, Robert de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford, Duke of Ireland and Marquess of Dublin. Maud's husband was an incompetent Justiciar, thoroughly despised by the Irish; under his badly managed administration, the civil war that was waged between the Desmond and de Burgh families was at its height. He was summoned before Parliament to answer for his misdeeds, and for the incessant quarrels and skirmishes permitted under his government between the Anglo-Norman noblemen.Eleanor Hull, A History of Ireland: The Statutes of Kilkenny, accessed 4 November 2009  Religious life  Following the death of Ralph de Ufford on 9 April 1346 at Kilmainham, Maud once again returned to England.

According to Young he was working in Afghanistan for Anham, a subcontractor of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Anham was a logistics supplier for the company. Young was Anham's deputy project manager for Afghanistan. He acknowledges shooting an Afghan on 1 October 2009‚Äîa former employee, but describes the killing as self-defense. Young was released from prison on May 17, 2012. In the Appellate Court Young was given sixteen years in prison. After the Appellate Court, Young was then represented by American Attorney Kimberley Motley in Afghanistan's Supreme Court. In the Supreme Court, Young's sentence was reduced to seven years in prison. Young described disgruntled Abdul Ghafar, his former subordinate, opening fire on his vehicle, and that he had merely returned fire. The South African newspaper The Independent quoted Thinus Coetzee, of Amnesty International. He called Young's conviction \\"deeply flawed\\" Young described being held in a communal cell, with fifteen other men, during his pre-trial detention. He described being held with Taliban and al Qaeda suspects, and had been called upon to fight for his life with fellow prisoners. Following his conviction he was held in a special counter-narcotics prison and in the Pul-e-Charkihi prison. Conditions improved there. Anham colleagues were allowed to bring him a birthday cake, although he wasn't allowed to eat any of it. Ultimately, Motley lobbied for Young's early release from prison to the Afghan President Hamid Karzai and he served over two years in prison. His release followed a pardon decree from Afghan President Hamid Karzai.

Hanna-Barbera Land Hanna-Barbera Land is the original children's area in the park which opened with the park. Initially called \\"Happyland of Hanna-Barbera\\" cartoon characters such as Yogi Bear and Fred Flintstone provided the theme for children's rides. When the section opened in 1981 it had three sections. The first section was \\"Yogi's Woods\\", based on The Yogi Bear Show. \\"Scoobyville\\" was the central town site, where a carousel and other attractions were included. On the opposite end of Scoobyville from Yogi's Wood was \\"Bedrock\\", based on The Flintstones. Yogi's Woods was replaced in 1984 (see Kidzville), and Bedrock was replaced in 2003 (see Nickelodeon Central). Due to Cedar Fair's take over the park, many of the Hanna-Barbera references are expected to be removed in the near future. Until the end of the 2009 season, Hanna-Barbera Land has Aerofield, a ride with WWI style plans, Ghoster Coaster, Hanna-Barberry-Go-Round Carrousel, Scooby-Doo's Haunted Mansion, Jetson's Rocketport, Revolving Cages, and Swan Lake. Canada's Wonderland is the last of the parks to have a Hanna-Barbera Land. \\"Happyland of Hanna- Barbera\\" was found at the sister Paramount Parks of Carowinds, Kings Dominion (replaced by Kidzville in 1997), and Kings Island (upper part renamed to Nickelodeon Central in 2001, and both sections renamed Nickelodeon Universe in 2006). In addition, the other sister Taft Broadcasting park of Australia's Wonderland, had a Hanna-Barbera Land, which was largely based on the layout of the Canada's Wonderland, until the park's closure in 2002. Hanna-Barbera Land closed down following the end of the 2009 operating season, and has been replaced by Planet Snoopy in 2010. KidZville In 1984, \\"Smurf Village\\" replaced Yogi's Woods; a themed area of Hanna-Barbera Land. The section featured the newly popular Hanna-Barbera cartoon The Smurfs and was a walk- through attraction. For the 1993 season, the Smurf Village section became \\"Kids Kingdom.\\" The year 1998 saw the Kidzville (styled as KidZville) area replace the Kids Kingdom. While the two Kids Kingdom rides were kept, Kidzville also introduced Taxi Jam, Flavourator, Chopper Chase, Toucan Sam maze, and Swing Time (which removed Snail Trail). Today, it also has the rides, Frequent Flyers, Jokey's Jalopies, and Kidzville Station. A fourth themed area is Zoom Zone. Quite small, it is part of Kidzville. Created in 2001 with the debut of Silver Streak, it also contains the small rides of Blast Off, and Jumpin' Jet. One of the Kidzville rides, and originally a Kids Kingdom ride, Jumbo Bumps, was removed to make way for these three rides and new section. Starting in 2004, the Zoom Zone was no longer printed on the park maps as an independent section, however since Cedar Fair's takeover each of the three rides mentions it is in Zoom Zone, and park signage continues to indicate the name. For operational purposes, Kidzville, Nickelodeon Central, and Hanna-Barbera Land are all considered to be one operational area, known internally by staff members as \\"H.B.\\", for Hanna-Barbera. Sister Paramount Parks of Kings Dominion, and California's Great America both have a Kidzville. Both created Kidzville by replacing Hanna-Barbera themed areas. Kings Dominion replaced their Hanna-Barbera Land in 1997, and Great America replaced their \\"Smurf Woods\\" themed area in 1999. Planet Snoopy has now replaced KidZville as well as Nickelodeon Central (2013). Nickelodeon Central Nickelodeon Central is another children's section of the park carved out of part of Hanna- Barbera Land in 2003. It replaced \\"Bedrock\\", a Flintstones-themed area of Hanna-Barbera Land. Only the bumper cars were kept, turned into the Rugrats Toonpike. The Barney's Burgers restaurant was de-themed, and turned into a Pizza Pizza. The rides and area have a Nickelodeon theme. It also includes the rides Wild Thornberries Tree Top Lookout, Jimmy Neutron's Brainwasher, Dora's Dune Buggies. The first ride accident in the park's history was August 23, 2003, when the Jimmy Neutron Brainwasher fell apart. Three children were sent to hospital as a precautionary measure.\\"Three kids hurt on Canada's Wonderland ride\\", The Canadian Press, August 23, 2003. A Nickelodeon Central section is also found at the other Cedar Fair theme parks of Carowinds (in 2003), Kings Dominion (in 2000), Kings Island (in 2001 and then expanded to Nickelodeon Universe in 2006), and California's Great America (in 2003). It is also found at the Australia theme park of Dreamworld, where through an alliance with Nickelodeon, they created a Nickelodeon Central in 2002 based on a similar concept on the Paramount Parks theme parks. As with most things \\"Nickelodeon\\", the word is often shorted to \\"Nick\\" and hence the area is often called \\"Nick Central\\". Nickelodeon Central is unrelated to the Nickelodeon Universe at the Mall of America in Minnesota. Cedar Fair Entertainment Company acquired Paramount Parks from Viacom in 2006, for $1.24 Billion. In an August 2007 article with FunWorld, the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) magazine, they said that they were excited about the Nickelodeon and Hanna-Barbera licenses, pointing out that the model for their children's areas was Kings Island's Nickelodeon Universe. Nickelodeon Central was closed down following the end of the 2009 operating season, and was replaced by Planet Snoopy in 2010. Planet Snoopy Planet Snoopy opened in 2010 as a replacement for Nickelodeon Central and Hanna-Barbera land.

Biography Ho Anh Thai was born in 1960 in Hanoi. He graduated from Hanoi University of Diplomacy in 1983. After graduation, he worked as a diplomat abroad, especially in India, Iran and Indonesia. Fluent in several foreign languages, he earned a Ph.D. in Oriental Studies and he is also an Indologist and a visiting lecturer in the University of Washington and foreign universities. He was the elected president of Hanoi Writers‚Äô Association from 2000 to 2010. And he was appointed the Vietnam Deputy Ambassador to Iran (2011-2015), and Indonesia (2015-2018). Literary career Ho Anh Thai first became known as a literary teenage prodigy with the publication of his first stories. As he matured, he became a voice for his generation, with his fresh, youthful style of writing, and works that centered on the lives and adventures of young people and students, highlighting their desire to discover the world. Some of his works of this period are the novels Men and Vehicle Run in the Moonlight (1986), The Women on the Island (1986), Behind the Red Mist (1989) and the short story collections The Goat Meat Special (1988), Fragment of a Man (1991), etc. Early in the 1990s, he published a series of humorous and thoughtful stories about the six years he has spent in India: The Man Who Stood on One Leg, The Indian, A Sigh through the Laburnums, The Barter, etc. From the 2000s, his published books became more experimental, playful in language and marked by a wry and sardonic tone that was both much appreciated by his growing readership and also considered controversial: the novels The Apocalypse Hotel (2002), Ten and One Nights (2006), RHT is Rat Hunt Team (2011), Erased by the Wind (2012), His Children are Scattered on the Road (2014), Burning Van Gogh (2018), Five Letters of Credence (2019) etc. and short stories collections The Narration of 265 Days (2001), Four Paths to the Fun House (2004), Man is Here and the Sky is There (2013) etc. Ho Anh Thai came back to the theme of India with the novel The Buddha, Savitri and I, published in 2007. This is the first Vietnamese novel which contemporizes the Buddha through an interesting plot and simple style set in a multi-layered structure which effectively broadens his use of time and space. Ho Anh Thai's books have always been best-sellers; part of the phenomenon of his work is that he has a large readership in spite of the way he has eschewed formulaic writing and strives for freshness and originality in form and language. His fiction has been published abroad, translated into over ten languages, including English, French, Korean, Swedish etc. Selected works * Ch√†ng trai ·ªü b·∫øn ƒë·ª£i xe (The Boy Who Waits at the Bus-stop, 1985) * Ph√≠a sau v√≤m tr·ªùi (1986) * V·∫´n ch∆∞a t·ªõi m√πa ƒë√¥ng (Winter is Not Here,Yet, 1986) * Ng∆∞·ªùi v√† xe ch·∫°y d∆∞·ªõi √°nh trƒÉng (Men and Vehicle Run in the Moonlight, 1987) * Ng∆∞·ªùi ƒë√†n b√† tr√™n ƒë·∫£o (The Women on the Island, 1988) * Nh·ªØng cu·ªôc ki·∫øm t√¨m (The Searches, 1988) * Mai ph·ª•c trong ƒë√™m h√® (Ambush in the Summer Nights, 1989) * Trong s∆∞∆°ng h·ªìng hi·ªán ra (Behind the Red Mist, 1990) * M·∫£nh v·ª° c·ªßa ƒë√†n √¥ng (Fragment of a Man, 1993) * Ng∆∞·ªùi ƒë·ª©ng m·ªôt ch√¢n (The Man Who Stood on One Leg 1995) * L≈© con hoang (The Bastards, 1995) * Ti·∫øng th·ªü d√†i qua r·ª´ng kim t∆∞·ªõc (A Sigh through the Laburnums, 1998) * H·ªç tr·ªü th√†nh nh√¢n v·∫≠t c·ªßa t√¥i (They Have Become My Characters, 2000) * T·ª± s·ª± 265 ng√†y (The Narration in 265 Days, 2001) * C√µi ng∆∞·ªùi rung chu√¥ng t·∫≠n th·∫ø (Apocalypse Hotel, 2002) * B·ªën l·ªëi v√†o nh√† c∆∞·ªùi (Four Paths to the Fun House, 2005) * ƒê·ª©c Ph·∫≠t, n√†ng Sivitri v√† t√¥i (The Buddha, Savitri and I, 2007) * M∆∞·ªùi l·∫ª m·ªôt ƒë√™m (Ten and One Nights, 2006) * Namaskar!

Although not recognized by any other country, it maintains its own currency, passports, police force, courts, state flag and state hymn. History The Other World Kingdom was officially founded on June 1, 1996, and was open to visitors by the spring of 1997, after two years of construction costing ¬£2 million. It provides a dominance and submission environment of a size and consistency not available at any other facility in the world. The land and buildings were offered for sale in 2008 with an asking price of eight million euros. The sale particulars suggested the property was suitable for use as a hotel, restaurant, residence, or old people's home. As of 2016, it was still for sale. As of 2020 the OWK still owns the building and organizes regular events at the property. Government The OWK styles itself as a matriarchy, where women rule. It also has strong BDSM and female dominance themes. The state's goal \\"is to get as many male creatures under the unlimited rule of Superior Women on as much territory as possible.\\" The OWK had always billed itself as a state; it is, however, a private for profit enterprise with no connection to, nor sanctioning by, any recognized sovereign state. The OWK is supposedly ruled by Queen Patricia I, an absolute monarch whose coronation took place on May 30 and 31, 1997. She was able to amend laws and other legal issues. Her other roles include \\"Sublime Supreme Administrator\\" (\\"supervision over all activities within the Area and the Office of the Supreme Administrator\\"), \\"Sublime Administrator of the Treasury\\" (Financial issues) and of the Queen's court and the Queen's guard. Below the Queen was a series of different classes. The first was the \\"Sublime Ladies\\" or \\"Ladies citizens,\\" who form the Kingdom's nobility. To become a citizen, a woman had to fulfill certain criteria. These were: * The woman must have reached the age of consent. * The ownership of at least one male slave. * Obeying the principles and laws of the OWK. * Sending an application for citizenship. * Spending at least five nights in the Area of Queen's Palace. The next class was the Queen's subjects. These were men who followed OWK law, obey the Queen and pay her taxes, but have some rights such as \\"freedom to travel, own property and deal with such property, have children, change employment, enterprise and state his opinion.\\" The lowest class is the \\"Slave\\" class. This was a male class who had forfeited all rights, were property of the Queen or Sublime Ladies and were considered to be \\"on the level of a normal farm animal\\". Facilities The site is in area, with several buildings, and a oval track, small lake and grassed lawns. The main building was the Queen's Palace, which was the residence of the monarch, and contains a banqueting hall, library, throne room, torture chamber, schoolroom, gym, and extensive basement prison, the cells of which could be hired. Additional visitor accommodation is provided in the Long House, including the Countess Elizabeth B√°thory Chambers complete with two torture chambers. This building also contains a swimming pool, pub, restaurant, and the Wanda Nightclub. The outdoor facilities are supplemented by a sawdust- covered indoor riding hall and stables.

Plot Hank Donner is a marine biologist camping and studying the underwater fauna near a Northwest Pacific fishing town. One day, while Hank and his local assistant Deke study a pod of gray whales swimming past the cove where they have set up camp, they witness a pair of fishermen, Joe Clausen and Burt, shooting at a passing group of killer whales. A female is fatally wounded and drifts into the cove, where she beaches and dies. Her mate remains near the carcass, mourning; Clausen and Burt insist on killing him, but Hank manages to send them off. Hank seals off the cove with a net barrier strung across the entrance and then sets down to study the orca, who is dubbed \\"Namu\\" in the film's song. They are watched with distrust by the locals, except Kate Rand, the owner of the fishing gear store where Hank purchases his supplies, and her young daughter Lisa, who admires Hank's work. As Hank continues his observations, occasionally visited by the curious Lisa, Namu eventually overcomes his grief and begins playfully interacting with Hank. In time, Lisa leads some of the local children to the cove, and they throw food to Namu. One of the boys, Nick, viciously stuffs a hooked float into a piece of fish, making Namu go wild with pain when he swallows it. Following this incident, the townspeople march to the cove, fully armed, to kill Namu. Hank, however, soon discovers the cause for Namu's agony, and to prove that Namu is a peaceful creature, he dons swimming gear and enters the cove, followed by Kate when the fisherfolk still hesitate. The sight of the two swimming with Namu finally disperses their prejudice, but then Clausen, who has separated from the mob, opens fire from a boat beyond the net barrier. Hank has Deke open the net; Namu swims out and overturns Clausen's boat, but instead of killing him, he keeps Clausen afloat until Hank and Deke fish him out. Once out in the open water, Namu encounters another group of orcas and joins them in swimming out into the sea. Cast *Robert Lansing ... Hank Donner *John Anderson ... Joe Clausen *Robin Mattson ...

History Gallia County was established in 1803 from land that was once Washington County. The first settlers were French refugees fleeing from the terror of the French Revolution. When these refugees landed they discovered their land grants were worthless and were part of an overseas swindle. When these unfortunate victims thought all was lost, President Washington intervened and arranged for them to settle lands of the Ohio Company south of Marietta. These original settlers would be known as \\"the 500\\". The \\"500\\" reached their new lands in October 1790, where they cleared the land and constructed 80 log cabins along a rectangular grid, which they named Gallipolis, which is translated as \\"City of the Gauls\\". The settlers petitioned successfully the Ohio General Assembly to grant them the status of being a county and construction of a courthouse began in 1806. This courthouse was placed on a sandstone foundation that ended two feet above ground, where the red brick structure began. The two-story building was rectangular in shape and was lined by large rectangular windows and a central door. The building was completed in 1812, but was later torn down and replaced by a second courthouse. This second courthouse was burned down by an arsonist and was rebuilt in the same style, until it was again set on fire by arsonists. The courthouse was repaired again, but in a repeat of history, it caught fire again and was rebuilt to a fine example of the Italianate style. This building, the fourth courthouse, lasted until a 1981 fire. The present modernistic structure was completed in its stead four years later.Gallia County Courthouse, Supreme Court of Ohio, n.d.

Now Lechfeld is planned as Germany's second base for the Airbus A400M Atlas transport aircraft, which will be stationed here from 2025.  History  In 1912, the German Army's military flight operations started at Lechfeld, but were forbidden after the First World War. Flight operations were resumed in 1934 and a flight school was opened. The Messerschmitt Works at Augsburg used Lagerlechfeld also as a test airfield. On May 22, 1943, at Lechfeld, Adolf Galland made his first flight in the Messerschmitt Me 262, a highly advanced twin engine jet fighter. He told Hermann G√∂ring, \\"It felt as if angels were pushing.\\"Robert Forsyth, Jagdgeschwader 7 'Nowotny' (Osprey Publishing), p. 10 In April 1944 a special Luftwaffe service test unit began training of operational pilots on the Me 262A. Most of the buildings were destroyed by 1945 after several air attacks. American use American Army units moved into the Lagerlechfeld area in early May 1945 during the Western Allied Invasion of Germany and seized the airfield with little or no opposition. Initial reconstruction plans for the base to be used as a United States Army Air Forces field were cancelled after the German Capitulation on 7 May, and the facility was garrisoned by United States Army units, although United States Army Air Forces personnel were sent to the base to evaluate the Messerschmitt aircraft left at the airfield. It was designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"R-71\\"IX Engineering Command Advanced Landing Grounds In December 1945, the facility was turned over to the United States Army Air Forces, which renamed it Army Air Force Station Lechfeld and was used by various units as an occupation garrison until being closed on 1 Jun 1947, being put into \\"standby\\" status and turned over to the Army garrison at Augsburg for control. Modern era The unreconstructed facility was eventually turned over to the reconstituted German Armed Forces in 1955, and the first German military personnel of the newly created Bundeswehr arrived at the Lechfeld on 7 July 1956. Their task was to rebuild the air base that had been damaged in the Second World War. Two years later, on 22 July 1958, 32 Fighter Bomber Wing began flight operations using F-84 Thunderstreak aircraft. On 14 September 1961, two F-84F Thunderstreak of 32 Fighter Bomber Wing crossed into East German airspace due to a navigational error, eventually landing at Berlin Tegel Airport, evading a large number of Soviet fighter planes. The event came at a historically difficult time during the Cold War, one month after the construction of the Berlin Wall. Oberstleutnant Siegfried Barth, commander of the unit at the time, was transferred for the incident but later, after a number of investigations and complaints, had to be reinstated.STRAUSS-BEFEHL: Bier-Order 61 Der Spiegel, published: 9 May 1962, accessed: 30 November 2010 In 1965 32 Fighter Bomber Wing received the F-104 Starfighter until they were replaced between 1982 and 1984 by the Panavia Tornado. Lechfeld Air Base was used for several Cold War NATO deployments of USAF/ANG units during the annual \\"Reforger\\" exercises. In October 2011 the German Federal Ministry of Defence announced a reorganisation/reduction of the German Armed Forces. As a consequence, 32 Fighter Bomber Wing will be disbanded and 14 Student Company of the German Armed Forces Command Support School, also stationed at the air base, will be reduced to one of the elements of the German Armed Forces Command Support School. The base will house a branch of the German Air Force Engineering Training Centre and other minor units of the air force. The reorganisation will reduce the number of personnel stationed on the air base from currently 1620 to 570.Quoted from , PDF-file \\"Stationing of the Bundeswehr in Germany\\", p. 61 The disbandment of 32 Fighter Bomber Wing took place on 31 March 2013. In 2019, it was announced that Lechfeld would become the second base for the Airbus A400M Atlas transport aircraft. In addition to the main base Wunstorf, 13 aircraft of this type are to fly here from 2025.

The current meeting house was built in 1843, and is one of state's best examples of Greek Revival ecclesiastical architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Architecture The First Congregational Church stands prominently in the village center of Orwell, near the western end of an oval drive on the north side of Main Street (Vermont Route 73). It is an imposing single-story brick building, with a gabled roof and two-stage tower. The first stage of the tower is square with corner pilasters, and houses a clock. The second stage is an octagonal belfry, with four rectangular louvered faces separated by angled faces with paired fluted Ionic columns. It is topped by an octagonal cupola. The front facade has a fully pedimented gable above an entablature supported by four brick pilasters and two fluted Doric columns. The columns and inner pilaster demarcate a sheltered recess housing the main entrance. with The church was built by the membership, and retains much of its original form. The sanctuary windows, originally clear glass, began to be replaced by stained glass memorial windows in the late 19th century. One, the Children's Window, is unique in New England, as it was paid for by the children of the Sunday School in memory of other children of the church. History The church is an independent congregation \\"gathered\\" in 1789. The stained glass windows are not simply colored glass, but traditional stained glass windows, which illustrate Bible stories and teaching, such as Jesus and the children, the Trinity, and more. The sanctuary, which seats approximately 350, has its original pews, many of which were originally \\"family pews\\", purchased or rented by members of the church when the building was built. As recently as the late 20th century, some members still sat in their family's traditional pew, although the seating is now open to all. The fine acoustics lend themselves to organ concerts, congregational singing and makes easier preaching from the large Victorian pulpit. Music has long been a hallmark of the church, with organists serving for many years at the fine Hook-Tracker organ, built in the 1860s and restored in the early 1990s. This small instrument of only 16 stops two keyboards (including the pedal board)is nonetheless a versatile instrument. The church's parsonage, at the corner of Main and Church Streets, was built ca. 1825, originally in the shape of a cross, but the two additional wings have since been removed.

Description and history The Leicester Meeting House is the most prominent structure in the rural community of Leicester's town center, located in what is known locally at Four Corners, the junction of US 7 with the Leicester-Whiting Road and Fern Lake Road. It is a single-story brick building, covered by a gabled roof and resting on a rustically cut stone foundation. It is three bays wide and three deep, with tall round-top sash windows set in round-arch recesses. The main entrance is in the center bay of the south-facing front facade, which projects about forward and has a gabled roof. The double-leaf doorway is topped by a shallow arched transom window, and there is a Palladian window above; both the doorway and window are set in a shallow arched recess. with The church was built in 1829 by the Leicester Meeting House Society, formed in 1825 to provide a church meeting space for multiple Christian congregations. The brick was locally sourced, apparently made from clay sources about away. The only major alteration to the building has been in its interior, which was originally built with the pulpit at the south end, in a semicircular niche below the gallery. In 1869, the society voted to move the pulpit to the north wall, where it stands on a raised platform. The church has served many different denominations over the years, including Methodists, Congregationalists, Pentecostals, and the Church of the Nazarene.

It covers the East Staffordshire, South Derbyshire and North West Leicestershire areas. In the period December 2010-June 2011, it had an average daily circulation of 12,198. The only paid- for title in Burton-on-Trent, the Mail has been established for more than a century, and prints news from the town and its surrounding area. Burton Mail is part of Staffordshire Newspapers Limited, a media group which encompasses two daily newspapers, five weekly newspapers, and a selection of magazine titles. The Burton Mail is printed at Cambridge Newspapers Ltd's Milton base. History The Burton Mail first appeared on 2 May 1898, as the local mouthpiece of the town's Conservative Party. It was set up in competition to the existing Burton Guardian, which in turn represented the views of the Liberal Party. Financial backing for the Burton Mail came from the town's brewery barons, who continued to exert an influence over the newspaper well into the 1970s. As its rivals fell by the wayside, the Burton Mail flourished, changing its title to the Burton Daily Mail and taking over and incorporating other titles up until 1957, when the Burton Chronicle, the last paid-for opposition title to publish in the town, was bought out and incorporated with the Mail, weekly newspaper, The Burton Observer, to form the Burton Observer and Chronicle. The Burton Daily Mail Ltd had also started publication of the Burton Football Mail in 1946. The Burton Daily Mail Ltd continued as a trust- operated company until the early 1980s when it was bought out and incorporated into the Birmingham Post and Mail group of titles, then owned by the Iliffe family. In 2012, Local World acquired owner Iliffe News and Media from Yattendon Group. Published from Monday to Saturday, the Burton Mail changed from being an evening newspaper, on sale around lunchtime, to being a morning publication in 2006, now in the shops at around 6am each day. In 2012 the Burton Mail became part of the Local World group, formed by David Montgomery, who purchased Northcliffe Media from the Daily Mail and General Trust and, separately, Iliffe News and Media - of which the Burton Mail was part. The purchase of the businesses was approved by the Office of Fair Trading on 28 June 2013. In November 2015 Trinity Mirror purchased Local World, a major stakeholder in local news titles, from DMGT. Local World had been formed by former Trinity chief exec David Montgomery in 2012 to consolidate all DMGT's local newspaper holdings other than the Metro, expanding their holdings while streamlining production, to make the group more saleable. Its 115 titles are formed primarily by those of Harmsworth's historic Northcliffe Newspapers Group, alongside other smaller purchases made by DMGT and Local World subsequently, including the 2007 purchase from Trinity. The purchase increases Trinity Mirror's local circulation by around 50%. The deal valued Local World at around ¬£220m. In September 2014 Emma Turton became the first female editor in the newspaper's 116-year history. The Burton Mail was named Newspaper of the Year in November 2017 at the Midlands Media Awards. https://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2017/news/daily-beats-nearby-sister-title- to-win-newspaper-of-the-year/ The Burton Mail is currently edited by Julie Crouch, who took up the position in December 2017. In August 2015, the Burton Mail moved from its premises in High Street, Burton, which it had occupied for 98 years, and moved to a site closer to the centre of the town in Worthington Way, Burton.

Built in 1811 as the Monkton Borough Baptist Church, it is the second-oldest church in Addison County. it is a fine example of Federal architecture with later Greek Revival additions. Its initial design is based closely on designs published by Asher Benjamin. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Florona Grange Hall stands in the village of Monkton Borough, on the west side of Monkton Road north of its junction with Hollow Road. It is set back from the road on a slight rise. It is a large two-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its corners have narrow Federal style pilasters, rising to an entablature adorned with triglyphs. The front gable is fully pedimented, interrupted at the top by a square two-stage tower. The tower has a clock in the first stage, and a belfry in the second; the belfry stage has pilasters flanking rectangular louvered openings. A shallow gabled section projects from the center of the main facade, supported by four Doric columns. The three bays created by the columns each house an entrance, set in a rounded-arch opening with flanking pilasters and a keystone above. The interior has been significantly altered to accommodate Grange functions, but retains some of its 19th-century elements. with The hall was built in 1811 by a Baptist congregation established in 1794, and is only preceded in the county by the Middlebury Congregational Church, completed in 1809. In 1854, the present belfry was constructed, modifying the basic design of the exterior, which is based on a church depicted in Asher Benjamin's The Country Builder's Assistant, published in 1797. The Baptist congregation dissolved in 1903, and the building was acquired in 1904 by a Methodist congregation. In 1944 the Methodists combined forces with the local Quaker organization to share use of the latter's building, and this building was sold to the local Grange chapter, which had been organized in 1940. The hall continues to be used by the Grange as a community meeting and event venue.

History When Jacques Cartier passed through in the 16th century, the Iroquois had already established themselves in the area, calling it Agochanda or Agouchonda, meaning \\"place where one stops to eat and rest\\". It was also in this area in 1642 that Isaac Jogues was abducted by the Mohawks along with Guillaume Couture and Ren√© Goupil, and taken into captivity and tortured. In 1672, the Intendant of New France Jean Talon granted the territory as a seignory to Louis de Niort de La Noraye (1639-1708). In 1688, the Seignory of La Noraye (also spelled as: Lanauraie, Lanoraie, Noraye) was united with the Autray Seignory, granted in 1637 to Jean Bourdon who passed it on to his son Jacques Bourdon d'Autray in 1653. Although the Parish of Saint-Joseph-de-Lanoraie was founded in 1732, it did not really begin to develop until 1831. In 1845, this parish was incorporated as the Parish Municipality of Lanoraie, but abolished two years later in 1847, when it became part of the Berthier County Municipality. In 1855, it was reestablished as the Parish Municipality of Saint-Joseph-de-Lanoraie. In 1848, the Municipality of Lanoraie-d'Autray was formed. On December 6, 2000, the Parish Municipality of Saint-Joseph-de-Lanoraie and the Municipality of Lanoraie-d'Autray were merged to form the new Municipality of Lanoraie.

Life He was the eldest son of Richard Laurence, watchmaker, of Bath, Somerset by Elizabeth, daughter of John French, clothier, of Warminster, Wiltshire, and was born on 3 April 1757. Richard Laurence was his younger brother. He was educated at Winchester School under Joseph Warton, and at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, of which he was scholar. He graduated B.A. on 17 December 1777, and proceeded M.A. on 21 June 1781. On leaving the university he took chambers at the Middle Temple with the view of being called to the common-law bar, but eventually devoted himself to civil law, and having taken the degree of D.C.L. at Oxford, 19 October 1787, was admitted to the College of Advocates on 3 November 1788. Having made himself useful to Burke in preparing the preliminary case against Warren Hastings, he was retained as counsel in 1788 by the managers of the impeachment, together with William Scott, for colleague. He took no part in the proceedings in Westminster Hall beyond attending and watching their progress, but gave advice in chambers. His practice in ecclesiastical and admiralty courts thenceforward grew rapidly. He remained on intimate terms with Burke until his death, and was his literary executor. In 1796 he was appointed, through the interest of the Duke of Portland, regius professor of civil law at Oxford, in succession to Thomas Francis Wenman, and the same year, through the influence of Burke with Earl Fitzwilliam, entered parliament as member for Peterborough. His speeches in parliament heavy and simply followed Burke's line, except in matters of international law. In opposing the union with Ireland he insisted that Burke, had he lived, would have done so likewise. Laurence was a member of the committee appointed in 1806 to frame the articles of impeachment against Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, the last such case. He was chancellor of the diocese of Oxford and a judge of the court of admiralty of the Cinque ports. He died suddenly on 26 February 1809, while on a visit to one of his brothers at Eltham, Kent, and was buried in Eltham Church, where a marble tablet was placed to his memory. Laurence did not marry. His leisure time he spent in society‚Äîhe was a member of the Eumelean Club‚Äîor in writing. Works While pursuing his legal studies he wrote political ballads in aid of Charles James Fox's candidature for Westminster in 1784, and contributed to the Rolliad the advertisements and dedication, Criticisms iii. vi. vii. viii. xiii. and xiv. in the first part, vii. in the second part; Probationary Odes xvi. and xxi.; and the first of the Political Eclogues, viz. Rose, or the Complaint. His letters to Burke were published and edited by his brother in The Epistolary Correspondence of the Right Hon. Edmund Burke and Dr. French Laurence, London, 1827. His Poetical Remains, published with those of his brother Richard (Dublin, 1872), include some odes, and a few sonnets and some translations from the Greek, Latin, and Italian. Laurence was also a frequent contributor to the Gentleman's Magazine. His dabblings in theology appeared as Critical Remarks on Detached Passages of the New Testament, particularly the Revelation of St. John, Oxford, 1810, edited by his brother.

Completed in 1842, it is fine local example of vernacular Greek Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description and history The Salisbury Congregational Church is centrally located in Salisbury's small village center, on the north side of Maple Run Road. It is a single story wood frame structure, with a gable roof, clapboarded exterior, and limestone foundation. The building corners have narrow corner boards, which rise to a modest entablature. The front-facing gable is fully pedimented with a plain clapboarded interior. The facade is symmetrical, with tall sash windows flanking the central entrance. The entrance is in a slight recess, framed by pilasters rising to an entablature and projecting cornice. A multistage tower rises from the roof ridge, starting with a square stage, above which an octagonal stage has plain circular panels in four faces. The belfry is in the next stage, which is basically square, with louvered sides and chamfered corners decorated with paneled pilasters. A slender spire caps the structure. The interior retains many original period features, including box pews and the pulpit area. with The church was built between 1840 and 1842 by Asahel Parsons, a local builder whose credits include churches in Middlebury. It is one of the prominent reminders of the town's 19th-century industrial past, having been built near the height of the town's importance as a regional mill center. Most of the materials for the church were locally produced: virgin timbers were milled in local mills, nails were forged at local ironworks, and a local historian claims its window glass also came from a glassworks operating at nearby Lake Dunmore.

Built in 1846 by a local master builder, it is one of the state's finest examples of ecclesiastical Greek Revival architecture, and also housed local town meetings for more than a century. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description and history The Shoreham Congregational Church is situated prominently in the village center of Shoreham, at the southwest corner of School and Main Streets. It is a single-story brick building, with a gabled roof and stone foundation. Its front has a tall projecting portico, with four fluted Doric columns rising to a full entablature. The door and window bays on the front and sides are articulated by brick pilasters. The gable above the portico is finished with multiple levels of trim. The tower that rises above the front is elaborately styled, with a clock in the first stage and belfry in the second. Its stages are basically square, with chamfered corners featuring panel sections on the clock stage and paired miniature Ionic columns on the belfry stage. The tower is capped by an octagonal slate roof and weathervane. with The first church congregation was organized in Shoreham in 1794, and its first meeting house was built in 1800. In the first half of the 19th century, Shoreham became a remarkably prosperous agricultural community, its success derived from widespread cultivation of merino sheep. In 1846, the present edifice was constructed under the supervision of Jacob Lamb, a regionally well-known master builder, whose other credits include the Wilcox-Cutts House in Orwell, another of the state's finest Greek Revival buildings. The building's design is an original combination of designs taken from the publications of architect Asher Benjamin. The building's location on the town green was approved by the town, which requested permission to hold town meetings in the new building's basement. This use continued until 1956, when the meeting was moved to the local school.

Built in 1828 and last significantly updated in the 1870s, it is the oldest Quaker meeting house in Vermont, and continues to see regular use. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The South Starksboro Friends Meeting House stands in a rural area of southern Starksboro, on the east side of Dan Sargent Road. It is a modest rectangular wood frame structure, with a metal roof, clapboarded exterior, and modern concrete foundation. Its front facade has three bays, with sash windows flanking a minimally adorned entrance flanked by wide moulding and topped by a cornice. The side walls each have two windows, and the rear wall has a single window in the half story, providing the sole means of access to the attic. The interior has an entry vestibule across its width, which leads into the main hall, now typically arranged with pews in a circular configuration. The interior has original bead-board wainscoting, but most of its modest stylistic elements date to the late 19th century, including kerosene lamps for lighting and a small organ. Most of the property is taken up by the cemetery, which has modest headstones and burials dating from the early 19th century to the 1970s. with The Starksboro area was one of earliest places in Vermont to be settled by Quakers, drawn by Joseph Hoag, who had established a meeting at Danby. The Starksboro Meeting was organized in 1799 as the Lincoln Preparative Meeting, a subordinate group to that at Danby. In 1825, it was renamed as the Creek Meeting, and the present building was constructed the following year. Prior to that, the meeting had met at the home of David Morrison, which still stands several hundred yards north on Dan Sargent Road. In 1871 the building was enlarged by the addition of the entrance hall, and stylistic changes were made to its interior. The congregation supported a minister until 1923, and the building is still the site of regular meetings, albeit on a less frequent basis than in the past. The only other 19th-century Quaker meeting house still in use in the state is in nearby Monkton.

It was built in 1838 as a cooperative venture between three church congregations and the town, and is a fine local example of Gothic Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Starksboro Village Meeting House is located near the center of Starksboro Village, on the west side of Vermont 116 a short way south of its junction with Big Hollow Road. It is a single-story rectangular wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and a high stone foundation. A two-stage belltower rises above the roof ridgeline, with corner pinnacles at the top. The main facade is symmetrical, with tall Gothic-arched windows flanking the main entrance, which is itself topped by a Gothic-pointed window. A smaller arched window is set in the gable above. The entrance is framed by simple Greek Revival styling. The interior has an entry vestibule leading into the sanctuary, which is finished in plaster with simple vertical wainscoting. A kerosene-powered chandelier hangs at the center of the sanctuary. The basement of the building, originally one large space used for town meetings, has been divided into two, but retains many original features. with Prior to the construction of this building, Starksboro's town meetings were generally held in the village schoolhouse. Three church congregations, Methodist, Free Will Baptist, and Christian, each typically met in the homes of their members. In 1838 these groups came together and agreed on the construction of this building, which was completed in 1840. In 1868, the Free Will Baptists built their own church on the south side of the village, and the Christian dwindled and eventually died out, leaving the Methodists as the sole religious occupants. The town moved its offices and facilities into a new town hall (the present one) in 1910, and the Methodist formed a new union with the Free Will Baptists, using the larger edifice of the latter. This building then stood largely unused, with occasional use for community functions and services. Beginning in 1957 it has been maintained by the Starksboro Village Meeting House Society.

It was built in 1847, originally serving as the Wesleyan Methodist Church before becoming the town's first and only town hall in 1893. A fine example of Greek Revival architecture, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history Weybridge Town Hall stands on the west side of Quaker Village Road in a dispersed village setting in northern Weybridge, arrayed mainly on the east bank of Otter Creek. It is a single-story wood frame structure with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The roof is capped by a tower that rises from a low flushboarded square base to a six-sided louvered belfry to an ogee-shaped dome. The main facade has paneled corner pilasters rising to an entablature and a fully pedimented gable with sunburst planking. The interior retains significant Greek Revival woodwork, as well as original bench pews and early 20th-century light fixtures. with The building was built in 1847 following the split of the local Methodist congregation over the matter of slavery. The abolitionist faction had withdrew from the original congregation established in 1798, and built this church. Its builders clearly drew inspiration from the published works of Asher Benjamin: a number of its exterior and interior details are clearly drawn from plates in his pattern books. The Methodist congregations reunited after the American Civil War, but declined in size, and in 1893 leased the building to the town for use as its town hall. It is the town's first town hall, and continues to serve in that capacity, in addition to hosting community events. The building originally housed the town's library in its basement, until 1911 when the adjacent Cotton Free Library was built. The building underwent significant restoration in the 1990s.

Description and history The Union Meetinghouse is one of the most prominent features of Ferrisburg's small town center, standing facing west at the northeast corner of US 7 and Middlebrook Road. It is a two-story brick building, with a gabled roof and limestone foundation. A two-stage belltower, a replica of the original (destroyed by fire in 1976) rises from the ridgeline, with a belfry featuring ogee-arched louvered openings. The brick of the walls is laid in American bond. The front facade is symmetrical, with two double-door entrances flanking a central tall Gothic-arched window with tracery. The entries are also topped by smaller Gothic windows. Similar windows are found on the building sides. The building originally had box pews, but these were removed in the 19th century in favor of auditorium-style seating. with The church was built in 1840 to serve a number of different religious groups in Ferrisburg. Its basic structure and massing are typical of earlier Federal period churches, with the Gothic windows adding a more recent (for the period) stylistic detail. Over time, the individual congregations built their own sanctuaries, and the use of this building declined. It was acquired by the town in 1898.

It is the vacationing and country residence of the President of Sri Lanka. Located within the limits of the Nuwara Eliya Municipal Council along the Queen Elizabeth Drive, it is a protected monument under the Antiquities Ordinance. History Built as an English country house in 1893 by the British Colonial administration of the island as the summer residence for the Governor of Ceylon, Sir William Henry Gregory. Gregory controversially sold the Governor's seasonal residence in Galle and constructed this new official residence without the consent of the Colonial Office. It was constructed for the sum of ¬£1,500 and the ballroom and drawing room were designed by Herbert Frederick Tomalin (1852-1944), an English architect/engineer in the Public Works Department, who also designed and supervised the construction of the General Post Office in Colombo. It was frequented by subsequent Governors and their guests between January and May to escape the tropical heat of Colombo in Little England as Nuwara Eliya was known. It was at the Queen's Cottage, Sir John Anderson fell ill and later died on 24 March 1918. He was the only British Governor to die in Ceylon. In 1947, (later Sir) Barclay Nihill, Legal Secretary and Sir Robert Drayton Chief Justice reviewed and approved the draft of the first constitution of Ceylon that had been drafted by Bernard Peiris on the request of D S Senanayake. Since independence in 1948 the house became the official vacationing residence of the Governor General of Ceylon and since 1972 the President after Sri Lanka became a republic.

Built in 1851, it is a fine local example of Greek Revival architecture with added Queen Anne Victorian features, and one of the oldest surviving buildings in a once-thriving mill village. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description and history The Union Church stands prominently at the center of the village of New Haven Mills in central-eastern New Haven, a now-rural village with a modest industrial past. It is a single- story rectangular wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. A modest square tower, with open belfry and pyramidal roof, rises above the roof. The building corners have pilasters, which rise to an encircling entablature and a fully pedimented gable on the front facade. The front facade is unadorned except for the centered main entrance, which is in a slight recess flanked by pilasters and topped by a corniced entablature. The interior of the sanctuary has rows of original bench pews, and its only illumination is from original kerosene lamps. It has a pressed metal ceiling dating to the late 19th century. with The church was built in 1851 for a congregation established in 1797, which met in a variety of spaces prior to the construction of this building. The village was by the 1840s a thriving industrial center, with the New Haven River lined with sawmills, gristmills, and other industry. The church was built by Eastman Case, a local master builder, and its elements are designed in part on similar features found in other regional churches, and in part from designs published by Asher Benjamin. Most of New Haven Mills' industrial and commercial buildings were destroyed by fires and flooding in the early 20th century, leaving the church as one of its most prominent surviving landmarks.

Built in 1837, it is a well-preserved example of transitional Greek Revival architecture. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It is now owned by the local historical society as a community meeting and event space. Description and history The Guilford Center Meeting House is located on the west side of Guilford Center Road, just south of Carpenter Hill Road and the Guilford Free Library in the central part of the rural community. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a front- facing gable roof and clapboard siding. Its front facade has a slightly projecting gabled entry, flanked by sash windows topped by lancet-arched louvers. The entry section has paired entrances, each flanked by pilasters and topped by a corniced entablature, with sash windows above, and with a fully pedimented gable. A two-stage square tower rises above the entrance, with lancet-arched louvered openings high on the first stage, and on the second, belfry stage. The stages are demarcated by crenellated parapets. The interior of the church is relatively simple, with semi-boxed pews arranged in three groups, and the pulpit at the far end of the sanctuary. There is a loft area above the entrance vestibule. The church was built in 1837, using materials salvaged from an earlier meetinghouse. It was erected by a Universalist congregation at a cost of $2409, and represents one of the state's earliest examples of Gothic religious architecture.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Description and history Oak Hill Cemetery is located southwest of the main village of Bellows Falls, on a terrace of the eponymous hill, which rises higher to its west. Saxtons River Road (Vermont Route 121) is downslope, separated by a wide band of forest, and the main entrance is on Pleasant Street, at its northern end. The chapel is located at the western edge of the cemetery near its northern edge, which there abuts Birch Street. The chapel is a modest 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, about in size, with a gabled roof, vertical board-and-batten siding, and a 20th-century brick foundation. The front faces east, and has a single-story hip-roof porch, with turned posts, and there is simple Stick style woodwork in the roof gable. The facade is three bays wide, with the entrance flanked by sash windows, and a single sash window in the gable. Side elevations are also three bays wide, with a sliding shed door in the rear bay of the south side. The interior is divided into two spaces.

Built in 1817, it is a modest Federal style brick structure that served as a church and civic center into the 20th century. Architecturally it represents a transitional period, built with the furnishings (long since removed) of a typical 18th-century New England colonial meeting house, arranged on the long axis as was typical of 19th- century churches. It is now owned by the town, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The Old Brick Church is located in a rural area of the small town of Athens, southwest of the town center, a short way north of Athens Road (Vermont Route 35) near its junction with Mill Hill Road. It is a 2-1/2 story masonry structure, built primarily of brick, with a wood frame back wall and gable ends sheathed in clapboards. It rests on a rubblestone foundation, and has a square tower projecting from the front. The walls are laid in Flemish bond to the top of the second floor, and there is wood framing above, including in the tower, whose upper exterior levels are clapboarded. The interior, originally a large open chamber with gallery at the rear, now has a full second floor, which was probably added c. 1860 amid other alterations. The church was built in 1817 by the Methodist Society of Athens, founded in 1801. The society was part of a local circuit of Methodist congregations, and this was the first church built to serve them. When built, the interior included box pews, and a high pulpit with sounding board at the north end of the building. By the late 1850s, the center of Athens had migrated from this area to the northeast, including the construction of a new Methodist church. This building was then altered, removing the box pews and pulpit, and adding the second floor as an assembly hall for town meetings. In 1924 a local organization was formed to maintain the building, but was hampered by funding and only achieved limited repairs. The town formally took over the building in 1951, and continued to use it for town meetings into the 1970s.

The diner was constructed in 1941 by the Worcester Lunch Car Company as #771, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Miss Bellows Falls Diner stands on the southwest side of Rockingham Street, just northwest of the central business district of Bellows Falls. The diner is set parallel and close to the road. It is a barrel-roofed metal structure, in size, its exterior finished in original enamel panels bearing the diner's name. The entrances to the diner are at its ends, each sheltered by an added vestibule. The kitchen and bathroom facilities are located in a wood-frame addition to the rear. The interior of the diner retains original finishes, including walls finished in enamel panels and varnished wood, a polychrome tile floor, oak booths with Formica table tops, and the main counter's marble and metal finish. The service area also has original features, including enameled refrigerator cabinets and recessed menu boards. The diner, built in 1941 by the Worcester Lunch Car Company, is the only known intact example of a Worcester barrel-roofed diner in the state. It was originally built for John Korsak and Frank Willie for a location in Lowell, Massachusetts, where it was called Frankie & Johnny's. Both Korsak and Willie were called up into the military for World War II, and the diner was sold to go to Bellows Falls, where it arrived on May 14, 1944, replacing an earlier diner on the site. Date of Construction The National Register application for Miss Bellows Falls Diner incorrectly states this diner was assembled \\"probably in the 1930s\\", but its model number (#771) indicates 1941. The Rosebud (diner) in Somerville, Massachusetts, Worcester #773, was built in 1941. Worcester serialized their diners consecutively in order of production.

Built in 1903-04, it is a significant local example of Colonial Revival architecture, designed by prominent Vermont architect Walter R. B. Willcox. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. The congregation is affiliated with the United Church of Christ; the minister is Rev. Katelyn Macrae. Architecture and history The Richmond Congregation Church stands in the town's main village, at the northwest corner of Church and Bridge Streets. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a basically cruciform plan. The main gable is oriented to face Bridge Street, while flanking hip-roof sections extend to the sides. At the rear, a hyphen attached to the northwest corner joins the church to its parish hall. The exterior is finished in a combination of wooden shingles and vinyl siding that closely resembles wooden clapboards. At the southwest corner of the cross, a square tower rises to an open belvedere and a flared pyramidal roof. To its left is the main entrance, sheltered by a gable-roofed porch with clustered square columns. The main gable end has a large multi-section stained glass window, with Palladian-style flanking sash windows that also have stained elements, with a transom pane above the moving sashes. with The church was built in 1903, during a period of significant growth in the town, occasioned by the recent construction of the Richmond Underwear Company factory. It was designed by Burlington architect Walter R.B. Willcox, then one of the few architects practicing in the state. Although the church has many fundamentally Colonial Revival features (including the porch architecture, basic cruciform symmetry, and the use of Palladian windows), it has often been classified as Queen Anne, owing to its asymmetrical appearance and mixed use of exterior finishes. The parish hall was added in 1984, and is in a sympathetic Colonial Revival style, designed by Burlington architect Donald Albertson.

Built in 1832 and the interior restyled in 186o, this brick church is a fine local example of Gothic Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The Williston Congregational Church is set prominently in the village center of Williston, on the north side of US 2, opposite the town hall. It is a single-story brick structure, with a gabled roof and redstone foundation. A three-stage wood- frame tower rises from the roof ridge, with a square first stage, and two louvered octagonal stages capped by a cupola. The front facade is three bays wide, each defined by a recessed Gothic-arched brick panel. The outer bays house windows, and the center one houses the main entrance. A gothic arched window, is set in the gable above the entrance. Similar windows are found on the sides of the building. The interior has a large chamber with a gallery at the rear. The walls are lined with windows articulated by pilasters, and it has a flat ceiling, with a heavy plaster cornice and elaborate molded chandelier medallion in the center of the ceiling. with The church was built in 1832 for a congregation founded in 1800. Its interior is the result of an 1860 remodeling. The bell was manufactured in 1878 by the Troy Foundry Bell Works of Troy, New York. The church was closed and shuttered in 1899 and remained so until 1963 when a movement was started by the youth of the town, led by Mark Hutchins, to open and restore it. A lightning strike in 2007 destroyed the upper two octagonal belfry tiers and the original bell. The belfry was duplicated and another period bell installed by the Town of Williston, which owns the building. A remodel of the basement and a small rear addition now provide bathroom, kitchen and meeting spaces for the public.

He was a trusted military and political advisor to King Kamehameha I, known as \\"Kamehameha the Great\\". Although trusted with one of the last symbolic rites of the Hawaiian religion, he later became a supporter of Christian missionaries.  Life  UlumƒÅheihei (his original name) was born around 1775, during the reign of King Kalani ª≈çpu ªu. His father was High Chief Kame ªeiamoku, known as one of the \\"royal twins\\" who helped Kamehameha I come to power. After his father's death, he inherited his father's counselor position in Kamehameha's court. In his youth he was athletic, standing about tall. A story was told of how he once wrestled down an attacking bull by its horns. A few years after the 1795 battle of Nu ªuanu when Kamehameha conquered O ªahu and Maui, Hoapili was left in charge of the island of O ªahu and the royal court settled at Kamakahonu in present-day Kailua-Kona. His first marriage was to Chiefess Kalilikauoha (daughter of King Kahekili II of Maui island). From her his daughter Kuini Liliha was born in 1802 or 1803, about the same time his father Kame ªeiamoku died. Other sources give Liliha as an adoptive daughter in the ancient Hawaiian tradition of hƒÅnai. He would definitely later become a respected foster parent for royal children. In 1810 the King of the island of Kaua ªi agreed to become a vassal, and Kamehameha had united all the Hawaiian islands. By 1815, Kamehameha had established succession with two sons, and entrusted UlumƒÅheihei with the care of their mother, Queen Ke≈çp≈´olani, Kamehameha's wife with the best royal family background. This made Hoapili stepfather to Princess NƒÅhi ªena ªena. He became known as hoa pili which means \\"close personal friend\\" in the Hawaiian language because of his trusted relationship with Kamehameha. A saying of the time was O Ulu-maheihei wale no, ia ia oloko, ia ia owaho, meaning roughly \\"UlumƒÅheihei knows everything inside and out.\\" Hoapili was with Kamehameha when he died on May 8, 1819 at Kamakahonu. The dying king whispered his last wishes into Hoapili's ear. He and his half- brother Ho ªolulu were selected to hide the bones of Kamehameha in a secret place, according to ancient rituals. To add to the secrecy, they waited for a night of a new moon. Theories are a cave was found along the shore that was covered at high tides, in the area known as Kaloko. This would be the last monarch of Hawaii to have all the traditional funeral rites of the Hawaiian religion. When his nephew Keaoua Kekuaokalani organized an uprising, Hoapili was sent with chief orator Naihe to negotiate a peaceful settlement. Kekuaokalani refused, so Hoapii and military leader Kalanimoku led Kingdom troops to the battle of Kuamo ªo where the rebels were routed. Hoapili also led troops to suppress another brief uprising in the northern part of the island near Waimea. In 1820 the first company of Christian missionaries arrived in Hawaii. Although Kamehameha II was officially King, real power was held by Hoapili's half-cousin Queen Ka ªahumanu, who welcomed them. On April 11, 1822, some translators from Tahiti arrived with English missionary William Ellis. The Hawaiian language was close enough to Tahitian that the pace of education improved. In February 1823, Ke≈çp≈´olani renounced the practice of multiple spouses for royalty, and made Hoapili her only husband. Previously she had been \\"shared\\" with another former Kamehameha military leader, Kalanim≈çk≈´. On April 23, 1823, William Richards and Charles Stewart arrived in the second company of missionaries and taught reading and writing to the royal court using the newly devised writing system for the Hawaiian language. In May 1823 he and Ke≈çp≈´olani moved to Lahaina on the island of Maui, and asked for books and a chaplain so they could continue their studies. Hoapili served as Royal Governor of Maui from May 1823. Ke≈çp≈´olani died September 16, 1823 after being a baptism by Ellis. Her funeral was a mix of Hawaiian and Christian traditions. Sketch by Ellis of Ke≈çp≈´olani's 1823 funeral On October 19, 1823 Hoapili married KalƒÅkua KaheiheimƒÅlie (c. 1780‚Äì1842) who became known as \\"Hoapili-wahine\\", roughly meaning \\"Mrs. Hoapili\\". It was one of the first Christian wedding ceremony for Hawaiian nobility. Hoapili would then often be known as \\"Hoapili-kane\\" (\\"Mr. Hoapili\\") to distinguish the two. This made him stepfather to KekƒÅuluohi, who was Queen Consort of two kings and mother of another. They adopted and helped raise Prince Lot KapuƒÅiwa (KalƒÅkua's grandson, who would later come to the throne as King Kamehameha V) in the Hawaiian tradition known as hƒÅnai. In August 1824, Hoapili led troops from Maui to suppress an uprising by \\"George Prince\\" Kaumuali ªi on Kaua ªi. During the 1820s, Lahaina became a popular port for whaling ships. This led to conflicts between the sailors who liked to enjoy their time ashore with grog and women, and the conservative missionaries. Hoapili ordered cannon to defend the town after an irate captain of the English whaler John Palmer had opened fire on the mission station. By 1826, he ruled that all marriages on Maui should follow the Christian tradition. After the thatched house used as a church blew down, in 1828 he ordered the first stone church to be built adjacent to Moku ªula which was a royal residence and burial site on a small island within a sacred pond. His daughter Kuini Liliha married High Chief Boki, and inherited Boki's position of Royal Governor of O ªahu after Boki's disappearance at sea in 1829. Liliha was suspected of organizing a rebellion in 1830, and Hoapili was sent to peacefully relieve her of her duties. In 1831 he donated land to be used for the Lanhainaluna seminary founded by Lorrin Andrews. This school would produce some of the important historians of the time, such as Samuel Kamakau and David Malo. Hoapili was consulted as an expert in astronomy and ancient Hawaiian mythology for the first book published on Hawaiian history. Hoapili selected a promising assistant to become educated as a teacher for Hawai ªi island. As more companies of missionaries arrived, Hoapili awarded them additional grants of land, sometimes to the consternation of the people who lived there. Dwight Baldwin arrived in 1836, and would help Hoapili deal with the health problems of alcoholism and epidemic diseases carried on the whaling ships. Hoapili died January 3, 1840, and was buried at Waiola Church cemetery, then known as \\"Waine ªe Church\\".Waiola Church  Legacy  The Girls' dormitory at Lahainaluna High School (at the site of the Lanhainaluna seminary) was named for him. The area where he lived on O ªahu was given to his daughter Liliha and son-in-law Boki. It was then donated to the mission and became home of the Punahou School in 1841. Historian Sheldon Dibble called Hoapili \\"a meek and quiet disciple of Jesus and a firm supporter of the Christian Religion\\".

A square tower projects from the center of the main facade, rising unadorned to a point above the roof ridge, where three sides have blind oculus panels below an entablature and cornice. Above the cornice is a shallow roof around the smaller belfry, which has round-arch louvered openings below a cornice. Above that rises an eight-sided steeple, set on an eight-sided base. The main entrance is on the ground floor of the tower, set under a hood with Italianate brackets. Windows are tall and narrow, set in segmented arch openings. with The Enosburg Congregational Church was established in 1811, and its first permanent sanctuary was built on this site in 1820, shared by the local Episcopal Church. The latter congregation left in 1821, building its own church elsewhere in the town. The Congregationalists grew in number, and their church underwent major repairs in 1849-50. By 1870 space was acknowledged to be too small, and the building was transformed into its present appearance at a cost of about $10,000. Significant alterations included raising the tower to include a belfry and steeple, and an addition to the rear to enlarge the sanctuary. This work was all done when the congregation was near its height in terms of size.

Biography Tang studied many Chinese and Japanese martial arts, including taijiquan (with Chen Fake), xingyiquan, judo and kendo. Tang was arrested in 1927, during or just after the Shanghai massacre of 1927, under suspicion of links to the Communist Party, but was later acquitted and released. He then went to Japan to study law and martial arts. Tang was impressed by Japan's ongoing modernization, and wrote several articles advocating reform and modernization of the Chinese martial arts, with an emphasis on practical martial skills that could be used to strengthen the nation. After returning to China, Tang was hired as an editor by the Central Guoshu Institute, a martial arts academy which had been established by the Nationalist government under a similar philosophy to his own. In 1932, Tang travelled to the Chen family village to study Chen-style taijiquan, the oldest and original taijiquan style. Tang intended to clarify the origins of the art by studying the historical documents and records of the Chen family. After the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, Tang began participating in anti-Japanese activities. He advocated training in military saber and bayonet fighting techniques, and developed his own training equipment to do so. While living in occupied Shanghai in 1941, Tang went into hiding to avoid arrest by the Japanese-controlled puppet government. After returning to his home, Tang blamed his wife for having allowed his collection of martial arts books to be damaged by rats while he was in hiding, and she subsequently hanged herself. Tang was then arrested and tortured for his political activities, but there was no proof of any crime and he was released. In 1955, after the Communists won the Chinese Civil War, Tang began working for the Commission of Sports to study the history of Chinese sports. Having spent much of his money on collecting historical materials, Tang spent much of his life in and out of poverty. After completing The Preliminary Study of the Historical Materials for Ancient Chinese Ball Games, Tang fell ill and died in Beijing on January 20, 1959. Tang Hao is widely considered to be the first serious historian of the Chinese martial arts, and his works continue to be cited by contemporary scholars today. Tang published a dozen books and many articles on the history of Chinese martial arts. Much of his work focused on debunking the mythology and folklore of Chinese martial arts, in particular the false lineages purporting to link traditional martial arts to various ancient mythological or historical figures. Tang's Study of Shaolin and Wudang (Shaolin Wudang kao) attacked the myths, still popular today, that attributed Shaolin martial arts to the Buddhist monk Bodhidharma, and taijiquan to the legendary Taoist sage Zhang Sanfeng.

It is native to the Korean Peninsula and Shandong, China. Taxonomy and systematics The Korean brown frog has earlier mostly been considered as subspecies of Rana amurensis, that is, R. a. coreana. However, morphological and genetic analyses support its status as a distinct species, though closely related to R. amurensis. The boundary between these two species is unclear. Until recently, Korean brown frog was considered Korean endemic. However, molecular and morphological evidence show Rana kunyuensis from Mount Kunyu in the Shandong province of China is the same species as Korean brown frog and its junior synonym. Description It is the smallest of brown frogs in Korea, with males reaching up to and females to in snout-vent length. Habitat and conservation Korean brown frog inhabits in coniferous, mixed and deciduous forests, shrublands, and grasslands. Most commonly it occurs in open, wet places (e.g., wet meadows, swamps, riverbanks, floodplains, etc.). They breed in shallow lakes, ponds, ditches, large puddles, and marshes. Hibernating frogs can be found in large numbers in the bottom mud of ponds and pools. Korean brown frog may be locally threatened by habitat loss, but this common species is not threatened overall.

At its height of popularity, Spec's Music operated 49 stores, including \\"superstores\\" in Miami Beach, West Palm Beach, and Sunrise. The company's stores were located in malls, strip centers, and free-standing locations throughout Florida. Four of the company's stores were located in malls in Puerto Rico.http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Specs- Music-Inc-Company-History.html?mid=95 Spec's Music History History  Beginnings  Spec's was incorporated in 1948 by founder Martin Spector. The company's first store was a structure in Coral Gables, Florida, situated on South Dixie Highway on the outskirts of Miami. Inside, the store carried a collection of big-band melodies, recorded on then-standard 78 RPM vinyl discs, and other assorted merchandise.http://www.allbusiness.com/retail- trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4381905-1.htmll?mid=95 Martin Spector By the 1950s, Spec's expanded their sales line to include Kodak Brownie cameras, Magnavox television sets, washing machines, and refrigerators. By the 1960s, Martin Spector dropped the concept of selling other electronics in favor of selling just music, and with the birth of rock and roll the stores were now finally able to support themselves by selling music alone. Spec's stores became so popular during this time that Spector expanded his chain to both Broward and Palm Beach counties by 1967.  Expansion  Between 1968 and 1980, Spec's expanded at a rate of two stores per year, all located in South Florida. Many of the stores in the 1980s were given a flashy new wave look to them, a style which can still be recognized in many former Spec's locations that are now occupied by f.y.e.. The company went public in 1985 after making $16.6 Million in sales from its then-16 stores. During this same time, Spec's took advantage of the emerging VHS rental market, and added tape-rental divisions to each store. By the late 1980s, the number of Spec's stores increased from 16 to 42. In 1988, the company was recognized by Forbes as being one of the nation's 200 best-run small companies. In 1992, two Spec's stores were entirely destroyed by Hurricane Andrew, resulting in more than $1 million in damages for the company, and an estimated operating loss of $160,000. Also around this time companies like Blockbuster and Musicland began opening outlets in and around Spec's Music's markets, forcing the company to develop new strategies for the future. Aside from opening a prodigious number of new stores and renovating the majority of its existing stores, the company's executives also planned to focus on music selections they felt were under-served by national competitors. This involved placing a greater emphasis on Latin music, classical music, and merchandise targeted for children. To provide room for a greater emphasis on these items, the company decided to remove many of its lackluster video rental departments. By mid-1993, 12 of the video rental departments had been closed and another eight were scheduled for removal in 1994. Additional changes adopted in 1993 included new fixtures inside the stores that could house a combined stock of compact discs and cassettes, as well as listening \\"posts,\\" each equipped with two headphones and programmed to play 10 compact discs, with featured titles rotating every several days or weeks. These new additions were showcased in a prototype store that opened in Tallahassee, Florida, in early 1994. A little more than a year later in mid-1995 the company turned to the \\"superstore\\" format to try to maintain its leading position in Florida, which was being threatened by increasing competition.  Closure  In the early 1990s, Spec's opened two new superstores in Coconut Grove and South Beach. These two- story stores each featured more than 70,000 titles, a cafe, and weekend concerts. However, despite the hype surrounding the grand opening of these two new stores, Spec's Music was beginning to show signs of anemic financial performance. Sales and earnings were slipping, forced downward by the continuing stiff competition in Florida. Music sales were down nationwide, and Spec's Music was struggling. By the end of 1995, the company's annual sales stood at $79.6 million, a negligible increase over 1994's total of $78.4, but actual earnings slipped from $2.8 million to a meager $1 million. An attempt was made to restructure the company by hiring a former Burger King executive and closing several of its superstores. Despite this, on June 4, 1998 it was announced that Spec's would be merged with Camelot Music, then the nation's third-largest music retailer.Spec's Sold to Camelot \\"Camelot Music, Spec's Music announce merger agreement\\".

Following several royalty acquisitions in the 1980s and 1990s, Old Franco-Nevada sold its only mining property to Normandy Mining in exchange for 19.9% of the company's shares. In 2002, Newmont acquired 100% of Franco-Nevada as part of a three-way combination of Newmont, Normandy and Old Franco-Nevada. Newmont maintained Franco-Nevada as a royalty holding division, transferring numerous other royalties to it over the five-year period following the acquisition, building its portfolio of royalties to include investments in almost 300 royalties (two-thirds in bases and precious metal miners, and one-third in oil and natural gas). In 2007 Newmont spun off Franco-Nevada in an initial public offering. Early history Franco-Nevada initially began trading as a public gold exploration company in 1983 and was led by executives Seymour Schulich and Pierre Lassonde. At the time, oil and gas royalty ownership--but not gold royalty ownership--was an established business strategy. In 1985 Franco-Nevada raised $930,000 to purchase gold royalties in a follow-on offering. The company made its first royalty investment in 1986, spending half the corporate treasury ($2 million) to acquire 4% of revenues from a mine in Nevada owned by Western States Minerals. The mine had an annual production of of gold. Franco-Nevada assumed that known reserves would allow the royalty to pay for itself regardless of additional exploration results. By 2002 the property generated $23 million annually for Franco-Nevada. In 1988 Franco-Nevada purchased a royalty on the Castle Mountain mine in California. Despite the Castle Mountain mine being unsuccessful, losing money and eventually closing, Franco-Nevada collected triple its investment of $2.8 million. Franco-Nevada further went on to purchase royalties in various other commodities, but continued its focus on gold. Newmont take over In April 2001, Franco-Nevada sold the Nevada Midas mine, its only wholly owned mine, to Normandy Mining in exchange for 20% of Normandy and a five-percent royalty on the mine. That September, Anglo Gold made a bid for Normandy at a valuation 60% greater than Franco-Nevada's acquisition cost. Seeing the potential to take advantage of Newmont's rivalry with Anglo, Schulich and Lassonde approached Newmont Mining Corporation to discuss purchasing Franco-Nevada and Normandy, striking a deal richer than Anglo's offer, and ultimately valuing Franco-Nevada shares at a 22% premium. Split from Newmont In 2007 Franco-Nevada launched an initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange, raising CA$1.1 billion which helped fund the US$1.2 billion acquisition of a large portfolio of royalties from Newmont. The listing was one of the largest in Canadian history, second only to the 2000 Sun Life IPO, and the largest mining IPO in North American History.  Recent deals  In December 2010, Franco-Nevada took over Gold Wheaton, a purchaser of gold byproducts, for $830 million. In August 2012, Franco-Nevada partnered with Inmet Mining to invest $1 billion in various metal streams from the Cobre Panama Copper Project. At the end of January 2018, Franco-Nevada (Barbados) acquired an additional precious metals stream on Korea Resources Corp. interest in the Cobre Panama project (Cobre Panama) for US$178 million.

In 1793, Hagner was appointed a clerk in the United States Department of the Treasury by Gen.

He served under every administration for fifty-six consecutive years, resigning his office in 1849. Twice by direct votes the U. S. Congress expressed its appreciation of his services in the settlement of large and important claims. This office became at one time so prominent, from the calls made upon its chief by Congress, before the institution of the court of claims, that John Randolph of Roanoke, pausing in debate for a phrase to express his sense of the influence of Nicholas I of Russia in the affairs of Europe, styled him \\"the great third auditor of nations.\\" Hagner was succeeded by John S.

It is a prominent local example of Gothic Revival architecture, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description and history The former St. George's Church building stands in the village center of Bakersfield, on the south side of East Bakersfield Road, opposite the village cemetery. It is a two-story brick structure, with a gabled roof and a single-story rear addition. A squat square tower rises above the roof ridge, with a louvered belfry stage topped by a cornice and bellcast roof. The front facade is three bays wide, with a center entrance on the ground floor, three arched windows on the second, and a rose window in the gable above. The sides are five bays wide, also with arched windows. The interior has a vestibule, which opens to the two-story former sanctuary, with a gallery at the front of the building accessed by stairs in the vestibule area. with Bakersfield was settled in the 1790s, and its citizens began to raise money for a local institution of secondary education in the 1830s. In 1840 this building was erected, and the Bakersfield Academical Institution was established in its second story. The building was given the name \\"South Academy\\", and its ground floor was used for religious services by a Methodist congregation. The school reached its peak enrollment of 50 in 1850, and then began a gradual decline, in part due to competition from the North Academy, established in 1844 in the northern part of town. In 1864 the upper floor was taken over by a Masonic chapter, and in 1867 the Catholic diocese purchased the ground floor and bell tower. In 1885 the diocese purchased the rest of the building, and formally renamed it. In 1905 the upper floor was removed, and its windows were restyled in the Gothic Revival. The church closed in 1996, and the building has now been taken over by the local historical society.

Originally built for a Congregationalist group, it is now home to a United Methodist Church congregation. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description and history The Grand Isle United Methodist Church stands in the village of Grand Isle, on the north side of Hyde Road, about west of its junction with United States Route 2. It is a brick structure with a gable roof and a massive projecting Greek Revival portico, supported by four fluted Doric columns. The building corners have brick pilasters, and the front gable is finished in wooden clapboards, with a triangular louver at its center. A two-stage wooden bell tower rises from the roof, with a pilastered and corniced first stage, a louvered belfry at the second stage, and an octagonal steeple above. Some of its windows have Gothic arches, and its original wooden pews also have Gothic detailing. The Congregationalist Society was organized in Grand Isle in 1802, and was soon followed by a competing Methodist organization. The two groups cooperated in the construction of a shared meetinghouse in 1834, with the Congregationalists eventually constructing this building in 1853-54, directly across the street from the other. The Methodist church was sold to the town in 1903, and was demolished in 1975. The two congregations again joined forces in 1919, making this building a union church.

The original building was a grand symmetrical red brick Tudor-style composition enclosing a large courtyard, built to the designs of Edward Lapidge, the county surveyor. A purpose-built chapel was added in 1881. It came under the management of Middlesex County Council in 1888 and was renamed the Wandsworth Asylum. During the First World War it became the Springfield War Hospital and, after the war, it became the Springfield Mental Hospital. A new infirmary block to treat mentally ill patients who were also physically ill opened in July 1932. During the Second World War a serious bout of dysentery broke out at the hospital. It joined the National Health Service in 1948. It was one of the hospitals investigated in 1967 as a result of the publication of Barbara Robb's book \\"Sans Everything\\". The committee found that at least two of the charge nurses showed themselves prone to outbursts of ill-temper which expressed itself in violence. In 2004 John Barrett, a paranoid schizophrenic, walked out of the hospital and stabbed Dennis Finnegan, a cyclist, to death. In its heyday the hospital had 2,000 patients but it is now reduced to under 300 inpatients. Much of the original hospital building is now disused, and there are plans to convert this to a residential development, \\"Springfield Village\\". Proceeds are being used to create new state of the art mental health centres at Springfield and at Tolworth Hospital in Surbiton. In January 2020 ¬£150 million of funding was approved to create eight new inpatient wards at the hospital. In February 2020 the hospital was featured in the BBC documentary \\"On the Psych Ward\\".

How to Build a Robot Army: Tips on Defending Planet Earth Against Alien Invaders, Ninjas, and Zombies not only deals with how to reprogram household robots to defend against aliens but literally every imaginable monster. From vampires to Godzilla Wilson has you covered. With section titles such as \\"How to Slay a Vampire Clan\\"Wilson, Daniel H.

Bloomsbury, 2008. and \\"How to Repel Godzilla\\" there is no adversary that this book would leave you unprepared for.

Even though there is a section in the book that deals specifically with that scenario, \\"How to Thwart an Alien Invasion\\". Despite its apocalyptic aura the book is an easy read. The sections are all short and to the point with little to no flowery language but a lot of humor mixed in. Each section goes into describing what sort of attack you are facing and the monsters involved. Then looks at a typical personal robot that is available for reprogramming. The reprogramming goes in depth but again is easy to follow and stays on point to the hostile situation. Relevance in Science Fiction This book, How to Build a Robot Army: Tips on Defending Planet Earth Against Alien Invaders, Ninjas, and Zombies, is similar to Daniel H. Wilson‚Äôs other works because it is heavily laden with accurate and possibly useful information. The easy-to-follow prose that Wilson uses in this book not only fully outlines how to properly reprogram a multitude of robotic devices but also entices young readers. In 2009 How to Build a Robot Army: Tips on Defending Planet Earth Against Alien Invaders, Ninjas, and Zombies was awarded the ‚Äú2009 Quick Pick for reluctant Young Adult Readers‚Äù by the American Library Association (ALA).

Manpower Aaron Scheinfeld, owner of a Chicago law firm, hired Winter in 1936 and Winter moved back to Milwaukee when the firm opened a new branch there. Unable to find a secretary available to type up a last-minute brief that had to be filed with the Wisconsin Supreme Court in April 1948, the two attorneys were only able to finish the work with the assistance of a former employee who worked all night typing. This experience led them to consider that there might be a business opportunity in providing temporary services to businesses that needed assistance. Despite the fact that almost all of their initial temps were women, they chose the name Manpower at the suggestion of a friend. They rented a Milwaukee storefront, offering bookkeepers, stenographers and typists to businesses as a sideline venture from their law firm. Though their first year was unprofitable, they were able to start making money in 1949. Manpower offered courses to help workers improve their skills on new technology and was the first to offer temporary staffing for industrial positions.

The village grew from beginnings late in the 18th century to serve as a modest civic, commercial, and residential hub for the rural community. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Description and history The town of Waterville in northern Vermont was settled in the late 18th century and incorporated in 1824. The town center, located in its far south, grew as a linear mill village on the banks of the North Branch Lamoille River. Its first mills were sawmills and gristmills built early in the 19th century, and it was by mid-century a center for the processing of hemp. A textile mill was founded in 1846, which manufactured flannel cloth, but the success of that and other endeavours was cut off by fire. The village's industry declined later in the 19th century because it was bypassed by local railroads, and eventually all of the industrial buildings were lost to demolition or fire. The principal industry in the area is now dairy production. with The historic district is centered on the junction of Main Street (Vermont Route 109) and Church Street, also known historically as Bridge Street, because it leads to the covered bridge across the river. It extends west along Bridge Street just across the river to its junction with Griffin Road, and runs north on Main Street to its crossing of the river on a 20th-century steel girder bridge. It extends south as far as Oakes Road. The principal commercial building in the district is at the main junction, where three adjoining buildings now house a single general store. On the east side of the junction is the town hall, a former Universalist church building built in the mid-19th century in the Greek Revival style. There are two other church buildings in the village, including one built in 1911 for a new Nazarene congregation. Most of the residential housing in the district is vernacular and modest in scale, typically 1-1/2 stories in height, and of wood frame construction.

As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, she was a Princesse du Sang. She never married and died of lung disease. Biography Anne Marie Victoire was the seventh child born to the Duke and Duchess of Enghien. Her father was the only surviving son of le Grand Cond√© while her mother was a daughter of the political hostess Anna Gonzaga. She was born at the H√¥tel de Cond√© in Paris, the city residence of the Prince of Cond√© when not at court at the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye outside the capital. The two previous months prior to Anne Marie's birth saw the death of two siblings; Anne de Bourbon (1670‚Äì1675), known as Mademoiselle d‚ÄôEnghien till death and Henri de Bourbon, Count of Clermont (1672‚Äì1675). Anne Marie was reputedly so small that she was prevented from going to dances at court. She was also more attractive then her younger sisters Mademoiselle de Charolais (1676‚Äì1753) and Mademoiselle de Montmorency (1678‚Äì1718). She was known as Mademoiselle d'Enghien till 1688 when her oldest sister Mademoiselle de Bourbon married the Prince of Conti, the first cousin of their father. From then on, Anne Marie was known as Mademoiselle de Cond√©, taken from the title of Prince of Cond√© which her father succeeded to in 1684 at the death of le Grand Cond√©. It was the latter who organised the marriage between Mademoiselle de Bourbon and Conti. Mademoiselle de Cond√© would never marry; instead she would die at the Ch√¢teau d'Asni√®res outside Paris apparently of Lung disease. She was buried at the convent of Carmel du faubourg Saint-Jacques, Paris. The Ch√¢teau itself was later the home of Philippe d'Orl√©ans' mistress and later remodelled by the marquis d'Argenson. Her brothers-in-law included the Prince of Conti; the duc du Maine (illegitimate son of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan) and the famous general the Duke of Vend√¥me. Her sister in law was Louise Fran√ßoise de Bourbon, sister of Maine and mistress of Conti. She was once a possible bride for the duc du Maine but it is said that Maine preferred Anne Louise B√©n√©dicte de Bourbon, Mademoiselle de Charolais much to her annoyance. Her not marrying the duc du Maine is what reportedly caused her health to deteriorate till her early death aged 25. Another possible candidate was Georg Wilhelm of Ansbach.,George William is said to have preferred her sister, Marie Anne son of Johann Friedrich, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach and brother of the future Caroline of Ansbach, Queen consort of Great Britain. Saint-Simon writing at the time after her death said that she had : a beautiful countenance, and an even more beautiful soul, great wit, sense, reason, kindness, and piety which sustained her in her very sad life. So was she really regretted by all who knew her.

Built in 1818 and remodeled in 1855, it is an excellent example of Greek Revival architecture, with extremely rare late 19th century stencilwork on its interior walls and ceiling. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. The congregation is affiliated with the United Church of Christ. Description and history The Post Mills Church stands in the eastern portion of the dispersed rural village of Post Mills in northern Thetford, on the north side of Vermont 244 near its junction with Robinson Hill Road. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and concrete block foundation. The main facade faces south, and has a central projecting section with fully pedimented gable. A square tower rises, straddling the main roof and front section, with a clock in the first stage, which is topped by a low balustrade. Above that is an open octagonal belfry with arched openings, and an octagonal third stage topped by a bellcast roof and weathervane. The front facade has corner pilasters at the corners of both the main building and projection, and an entablature extends across the front and the sides. The portion of the entablature on the projecting section has a distinctive frieze, created in 1855 out of the doors of the building's original box pews. The interior originally with a three-sided gallery, now only has a gallery at the rear, with bench pews facing the pulpit at the rear. with The church was built in 1818, and was originally more Federal in its appearance, based in part on plans published by Asher Benjamin. It underwent a major renovation in 1855, when the pews were replaced, a platform built for the pulpit, and the side galleries were removed. In 1887, when the plaster of the walls and ceilings was renewed, Hiram Powell decorated them with stencilwork. This type of decoration is extremely rare and fragile, because of its use of water-based distemper paint. Elements of this work were carefully restored in the 20th century. The church was built for use by two congregations, one Baptist and the other Congregationalist. Local residents had for some years complained about the long trip to the Thetford Center Church (, essentially an all-day outing at the time), and the definitive separation of church and state in the 1810s freed them from tax obligations to that church.

Built in 1833, it is one of the finest examples of late Federal period architecture in Orange County, and was a mainstay of social and civic life in southern Tunbridge for many years. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description and history The South Tunbridge Methodist Episcopal Church stands facing east on the west side of Vermont 110, on a rise overlooking the road and the adjacent First Branch White River. It is one of two public buildings in what is now a rural cluster of residences; to its south stands a 1920s community hall. The church is a single-story brick structure, with a gabled roof and stone foundation. The roof is topped by a single-stage clapboarded square tower, which is topped by a corniced flat roof, and has arched louvered openings for the belfry. The main facade is three bays wide and symmetrically arranged, with entrances flanking a central sash window on the ground floor, and three windows above. The second-level windows are set in recesses and topped by distinctive recessed sunburst-patterned brickwork. The sills of these windows are formed out of ogee-shaped bricks. The windows on the side walls have the same features. The interior of the church has a vestibule area topped by a now- enclosed gallery, with the main hall featuring a pressed tin roof and raised pulpit at the western end. with Prior to the construction of this church, area Methodists met in a house known then as the \\"old parsonage\\", a short way to the north. This structure was built in 1833 by William Hutchinson and E. Colburn. Its brickwork and distinctive sunburst decorations set it apart from other Federal period buildings in the area. For much of the 19th century, South Tunbridge was a thriving community, with a district school, post office, saw and grist mills, and blacksmithy. The church was a center of the local social life, hosting dinners and other social events for many years.

She has published on the interpretation of early Indian ritual and narrative, comparative mythology, literary theory in the study of religion, women and Hinduism in contemporary India, and religion and conflict. Her early Indological work applies literary theory and theory of canon to the texts of early India, particularly Vedic texts. Later, she used a theory of metonymy to rethink the application of mantras in early Indian ritual. Her first edited work, Authority, Anxiety, and Canon (1994) surveyed the larger field of Vedic interpretation as it existed in various intellectual contexts throughout India.http://www.sunypress.edu/p-1849-authority-anxiety-and-canon.aspx She was co-editor on Myth and Method an assessment of the state of the field in comparative mythology.

Patton has also worked on gender questions, beginning with her edited volume, Jewels of Authority (2002), which examined early feminist stereotypes about women in Indian textual traditions as well as contemporary life. Her recent articles on gender are derived from her present project, the first ethnography of women Sanskritists ever to be undertaken in India.

Returning to London he freelanced at ITN and Channel Four News while launching Capital Radio's sports coverage with Jonathan Pearce. Television career At Christmas 1988 Dempsey was invited to audition for the launch of Sky News, which went on air in February 1989. Dempsey was one of the first presenters to be seen on screen and became a regular presenting sports news bulletins, simultaneously establishing himself as one of the lead commentators on Sky's initial sports channel, Eurosport. He covered the 1990 World Cup working alongside Ian Darke and Peter Brackley and the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. After the merger of Sky and British Satellite Broadcasting, Sky Sports became the new dedicated subscription sports channel for the network and Dempsey made his name covering football and boxing alongside other regulars, Richard Keys and Andy Gray as part of a multi-award-winning team. When Sky captured Premier League rights for the first time Dempsey presented Sports Saturday, later Soccer Saturday, with Sue Barker. He co-created the format for the show, which has remained unchanged for over 20 years, with Senior Producer Rik Dovey, a lieutenant of then Sky Sports chief David Hill.

For a period Sky enjoyed a near monopoly on the sport‚Äôs biggest names including Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield, Mike Tyson, Nigel Benn, Chris Eubank, Steve Collins and Naseem Hamed. Dempsey also became known to a wider international audience through regular commentary work for international agencies CSI Sports and TWI who relayed live Premier League, FA Cup, European and International football to a Worldwide audience. He was a mainstay of their football coverage and commentated on the final day of the 1994‚Äì95 season as Blackburn Rovers clinched the title at Anfield against Liverpool and again in 1997-98 as Arsenal beat Everton at Highbury on the last day to become champions. For 10 successive years Dempsey hosted the prestigious PFA Player of the Year Awards show from the Grosvenor House in London. In 2002, he was a commentator for SBS covering the FIFA World Cup.

In 2009, Setanta's Great Britain operation went into administration. However, Dempsey continued to present and commentate on Irish TV on Premier League, FA Cup, Champions League, Europa League and International football. The 2010 FIFA World Cup gave him the chance to continue his long association, on Australian TV with SBS, the main broadcaster of the sport in the pacific region. He had previously acted as both studio anchor and commentator stretching back to 1994, along with Martin Tyler. But in 2010 as Special Broadcasting Service developed their style and format, Dempsey was invited to host coverage from their Sydney HQ. In September 2011, Dempsey became a presenter and commentator on subscription boxing channel BoxNation. In 2012, Dempsey presented every game at Euro 2012 on Setanta, alongside pundits Dietmar Hamann, Gary McAllister, Dennis Wise, David O'Leary and Andy Cole. The coverage was carried into Singapore on StarHub and into Australia on Setanta Australia. For the London Olympics Dempsey was invited to join the IOC's broadcasting arm, OBS, in their 10-channel, 3-language, 18-hour-per-day Live service, assisting former chief BBC sports producer John Shrewsbury in an editorial and production supervisor's role. Additionally he served as co-lead commentator, with John Helm, on the Men's and Women's Olympic Football tournaments. During 2012-13 he was enlisted by ITV to help with their football coverage. For pay network Primetime he hosted the ill- fated ring return of Ricky Hatton in Manchester and, for ESPN, Wladimir Klitschko's world title defence, alongside co-host David Haye. In 2013-14 Dempsey quickly became an established host on BT Sport for football and boxing while continuing to appear on Setanta Sports in Ireland, anchoring the Premier League highlights show and commentating on Champions League, Europa League and International football. He was also recruited once more by the IOC TV arm to work on the Sochi Olympics in Russia. At the start of 2015-16 he presented BT Sport's opening game, the Community Shield, Arsenal v Chelsea from Wembley with Glenn Hoddle, Rio Ferdinand and Ian Wright and on the opening weekend of the premier league campaign was commentator at Old Trafford for Manchester United v Tottenham Hotspur in the first ever Ultra High Definition broadcast of its kind. Throughout the season he went on to commentate on Premier League, Champions League, Europa League and Bundesliga matches for BT Sport, culminating in the FA Cup Final at Wembley and the Europa League Final from Basel. He was also hired by UEFA for commentary duty on the Champions League Final in Milan. As presenter of Boxing Tonight he fronted all BT Sport's boxing output, additionally acting as presenter for the return of David Haye at the O2 Arena which drew a record 3 million audience to UK TV and, for Channel 5, was anchor for the controversial Wembley Middleweight Title fight between Chris Eubank, jnr and Nick Blackwell. The summer of 2016 brought commitments at Euro 2016 and the Olympic Games in Rio. In 2016/17 Dempsey continued as a commentator and presenter/reporter on BT Sport covering Champions League, Europa League and all Europe's top competitions with special emphasis on the Bundesliga. At the end of the season he was hired by FIFA affiliate HBS to provide commentary on the Confederations Cup in Russia, including the opening ceremony in St Petersburg. He was also confirmed as part of the commentary team for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. In boxing, BT Sport began live broadcasting of the sport in April 2017 and Dempsey took up the role of anchor on Fight Night Live as he had during his long career on Sky Sports. He also served several other broadcasters including Channel 5. In 2018 Dempsey continued to work mainly for BT Sport covering UEFA Champions League and Europa League plus the top leagues in England, Germany and Italy. At the 2018 FIFA World Cup he commentated from Russia on the worldwide broadcast. In boxing he presented and commentated on big fights all over the world, including the Alvarez v Golovkin Middleweight Title fight in Las Vegas which was BT Sport's first ever pay per view event and, in December, the biggest fight of 2018, the WBC Heavyweight Title fight between Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury in Los Angeles. In addition to his broadcasting commitments at the Brazil World Cup in 2014 he co-headed the operations of Union Filmes, the Brazil-based production company in which he is a partner. Main clients included SBS, ITV and BBC. He is also a founding shareholder in sports design business, ShadowmanSports.

Built in 1824 and modified with Gothic features in the 1880s, it is a well-preserved 19th-century brick church. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The present minister is Rev. Bill Kingsley. Architecture and history The Clarendon Congregational Church stands in the historic town center of Clarendon, opposite the town offices and facing the small town common on the east side of Middle Road in central Clarendon. It is a single-story brick building, covered by a gabled slate roof. A gabled entry pavilion projects from the main (western) facade, and a square tower rises above it to an octagonal steeple. It has tall sash windows, set in rounded-arch openings with half-round windows above the sashes. The projecting pavilion has a fully pedimented gable above a pair of entrances, and is two bays wide, each bay consisting of a slightly recessed panel housing an entrance (set, like the windows, in a round-arch opening with a half-round transom) and a semi-oval window above. The church congregation was founded in 1822, and the present building was constructed in 1824, originally with a square belfry and plainer windows. Despite a declining town population, the church experienced a resurgence of membership in the 1880s, at which time its steeple was added (built by the noted bridgewright Nicholas Powers), and its more elaborate stained glass windows were installed. Membership continued to decline, and in the 1920s regular services were suspended. Services resumed in 1935, and in 1983 the congregation merged with another to form the Clarendon Congregational Church.

The Marin French Cheese Company is a manufacturer of artisan cheese located in rural west Marin County, California. The company was founded in 1865 by Jefferson Thompson, and produces cheeses under the Marin French Cheese brand name.

The factory building is a modest 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, measuring about , with a gabled roof, center chimney, and clapboard siding. Its front facade is four bays wide, with a project shed-roof single- story vestibule covering the center two bays of the ground floor. The gabled south facade is three bays wide, with a second entrance set between the rightmost bay and the corner, and with loading doorways on all three levels at the center. A short boom projects at the top of the gable, providing a place to attach hoisting mechanisms for accessing those entrances. The ground floor is where the cheese is made, with vats taking up much of one half and a drying area the other. The shed-roof wing contains equipment for waxing finished wheels of cheese. Cheeses are aged either in the basement or the second floor, in facilities that are now climate controlled. The Crowley Cheese Company was founded in 1881 by A. Winfield Crowley, and was owned by three generations of the family for 85 years. It was formed to take surplus milk from area farmers, which would be turned into cheese and sold at the Healdville railroad depot. The Crowleys had already been making cheese from their own milk at facilities at the farm, just up the hill from this factory's location. In the days before modern refrigeration, factories like this were common all across the state. Most succumbed due to the decline of Vermont's farms and the advent of refrigeration, which enabled shipment of dairy products across much greater distances. The Crowley Cheese Company is believed to be the oldest surviving cheese company in the state, and one of the oldest in the nation in continuous operation.

When the caravan wanted to resume the journey, the oxen refused to move. Once the crate containing the image was removed, the animals started to move again. Given the evidence of a miracle, people believed the Virgin wished to remain there. The image was venerated in a primitive chapel for 40 years. Then the image was acquired by Ana de Matos and carried to Luj√°n, where it currently resides. Pope John Paul II visited the shrine during an apostolic journey.  Papal honors  Among the Popes who have honored Our Lady of Luj√°n are Clement XI, Clement XIV, Pius VI, Pius IX, Leo XIII, Pius XI, Pius XII, and John Paul II. In 1824, Fr. John Mastai Ferretti visited the shrine on his way to Chile. He later became Pope Pius IX and defined the dogma of the Immaculate Conception on December 8, 1820 Because of the reputation of the shrine, Pope Leo XIII decided in 1886 to honor the miraculous statue with a Canonical Coronation. On September 30 of that year, he blessed the crown, which was made of pure gold and set with 365 diamonds, rubies, emeralds and sapphires, 132 pearls and a number of enamels depicting the emblems of the Archbishop and the Argentine Republic. The papal coronation of Our Lady of Luj√°n took place on May 8, 1887. The celebrant chosen by the Pope for this event was Archbishop Federico Le√≥n Aneiros who at that time made a pilgrimage in thanksgiving to Our Lady for sparing his archdiocese from the scourge of cholera.

In 1982, during the Falklands War, John Paul II became the first pope to visit Our Lady of Luj√°n. During this visit the Pope celebrated an outdoor Mass in the square of the Basilica of Our Lady of Luj√°n and bestowed upon her the Golden Rose. Both in his homily of June 11 and his Angelus back in Rome reflecting on the trip, he commented on Our Lady's never failing maternal solicitude for the faithful in times of distress. Sixteen years later in Rome, John Paul II gave a replica of the image to the Argentine National Parish during his pastoral visit there. Basilica of Our Lady of Luj√°n. The Golden Rose Basilica of Our Lady of Luj√°n. The Golden Rose is a gift from the Pope to nations, cities, basilicas, sanctuaries, or images.

The house is reached by way of an impressive gateway and is situated at . History Saltoun Hall began life, in the 12th century, as a tower or castle and, at that time, was in the hands of the powerful de Morville family. Hugh de Morville was granted lands in the 12th century by King David I at Saltoun and his family were created hereditary High Constables of Scotland. Hugh de Morville was famed for his patronage of religious establishments: he founded Dryburgh Abbey in the old county of Roxburghshire around 1150. By 1260, Sir William Abernethy owned the lands and castle at Saltoun, and his descendant Sir Lawrence Abernethy was created Lord Saltoun in 1445. The Abernethys were owners at Saltoun for nearly 400 years but in 1643, the estates were bought by Andrew Fletcher, Lord Innerpeffer, to whose family the land still belongs. His grandson Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun (1655‚Äì1716) is remembered for his opposition to the Acts of Union 1707. Saltoun Hall Doocot Over the years, Saltoun Castle was spared trouble and there is only one recorded incident at the castle. In 1548, during Somerset's occupation of Haddington, John Cockburn of Ormiston held the castle for the English commander Grey of Wilton. Cockburn was an 'assured' Scot, one who agreed with the English point of view during the \\"Rough Wooing\\" campaign. The castle was quickly retaken in February 1548 by the Earl of Arran, who brought artillery from Edinburgh castle, and hanged 5 of Cockburn's men and took 5 prisoner.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1562, vol. 1 (London, 1898), p. 85: Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1911), pp. 57, 150: There were many extensions, changes and renewals at the castle but there are no records until the days of the Fletcher family. In 1769, Lord Fletcher added a new wing on the south side of the building. A separate extension was built for the library in 1779. This created an L-shaped house and a 'great stair' was built in the angle. In 1803, architect Robert Burn designed new turrets on the corners giving the 'new' house a castellated appearance. His son, William Burn, completely transformed the building on a large scale in 1817, creating what was described as a 'bleak magnificence'. A large square turret was added. The interior is in the Gothic Revival style, with rib vaulting throughout. A new corridor was built to provide a Gothic gallery and rooms were recast in a Grecian style. The house was sold in the late 1960s and subdivided into apartments. The Fletchers sold the building and some of the estate but the family still live nearby. Today's house owes much to the architectural style of William Burn. The house is said to be haunted by a 'grey lady'. Saltoun Hall was famed for a formally designed garden in the 19th century. Botanist David McHattie Forbes served as Foreman Forester for the estate from 1883 until his departure for Hawaii in 1887.

When it was built in 1807, it was a nearly exact replica of Plate 33 in Asher Benjamin's 1805 Country Builders Assistant. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Description and history The Sudbury Congregational Church stands in the modest village center of Sudbury, separated from Vermont Route 30 by the village green and accessed via a dirt road on the green's east side. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a gable roof and clapboard siding. A two-story vestibule projects from the south-facing front facade, with a square tower straddling the transition between the main roof line and that of the vestibule. The tower has a single stage, with a half-round louver on its front face, and Gothic corner pinnacles surrounding a short steeple. The eaves of the main roof, vestibule, and gables are lined with dentil moulding. The entry vestibule has a pair of entrances, each topped by a half-round multilight transom window. In between the entrances is what appears to be an entrance surround, consisting of pilasters supporting a corniced entablature. The framed space is presently occupied by a notice board. On the second level, sash windows flank a central Palladian window. The church was built in 1807 by Charles C. Stewart, for a congregation organized in 1803. Its tower notably lacked the Gothic features now present, and had a taller steeple, which was reportedly pulled down amid concerns it might be blown off. During the 1850s, the building's interior was adapted to accommodate the municipal functions of the town meeting, and it is then that the exterior Gothic features were added. At the time of its listing on the National Register in 1977, it was still used for both municipal and religious functions.

During the course of a day in July 2000, Austin killed his wife Claire Quinn (aged 31), their two children, Kieren (aged 8) and Jade (aged 7), and two dogs. In March 2001, Austin was sentenced to three concurrent life sentences. The presiding judge described Austin's family annihilation as \\"beyond the bounds of belief.\\"  Background  Claire and Phillip Austin married in 1993, after the births of their children. Austin worked the night shift as a forklift operator, and Claire worked for Northamptonshire County Council as a part-time home help. Phillip Austin was 31 years old when he murdered his family.  Murders  On 10 July 2000, Austin and Claire were at the house they shared on the Standens Barn housing estate in Northampton. Austin hit his wife over the head with a mallet, purchased that same morning specifically for that purpose. After a struggle, Austin strangled her with her own bra, and then, finally, stabbed her with two carving knives. Using the same mallet, Austin battered the family's poodles, Dandy and Sooty, to death. Having changed out of his bloody clothes, Austin drove to Claire's place of employment and told them she had injured her back and would not be able to work later that day as scheduled. Austin proceeded to pick up his children from school, and took them out for a meal of fish and chips on the way home. Once home, Austin sedated both children and strangled them in their bedrooms. One week later, staff at the children's school contacted Claire Austin's parents, Carol and Harry Quinn. The Quinns went to the Austin house and Carol Quinn discovered the bodies of her daughter, grandchildren, and their dogs.  Arrest and sentencing  During the week in which the murders remained undiscovered, Austin spent the week on the run, in Blackpool and Scarborough. On 20 July, Austin was arrested in the Lake District, as he sat in his car with his wrists slashed. When asked what caused him to attack his wife, Austin told detectives, \\"She started hassling me and arguing and that. I just turned on her.\\" When asked his reasons for murdering his children, he stated, \\"It sort of came to me that I had killed her so I went upstairs and killed my children.\\" Austin initially pleaded not guilty to the murders on the grounds of diminished responsibility, but in court on 22 March 2001, he changed his plea to guilty. That same day, Austin was given three concurrent life sentences. Austin will have to serve a minimum of 20 years, after which time he will be eligible to apply for parole.

Built in 1831 with later alterations, it is a good local example of Federal and Gothic architecture with a Victorian interior. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Description and history The West Haven Baptist Church stands in an open field on the west side of Book Road, just south of its junction with Main Road, the principal east-west route through the rural community. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and a mortared limestone foundation. A gabled vestibule projects from the front (east-facing) facade, with a center entrance flanked by Gothic arched windows. A squat two-stage square tower rises, straddling the line between the main block and vestibule, with a louvered belfry as the second stage, and a flat top above. The vestibule interior is finished in beadboard, while the main sanctuary has vertical matchboard below a chair rail, and horizontal matchboard above. Lines of stencilwork adorn the walls. The church was built in 1831 for a congregation, organized in 1803, which is one of the oldest Baptist congregations in the state. The building was renovated in 1854, when the Gothic windows (also found on the sides) were added, and again in 1886, when interior changes were probably made to its pulpit and choir loft area. The 1854 renovations probably also added ornate Gothic elements to the tower, which were likely removed in 1927. The building is now used only for summer services, due to a lack of heating.

Built in 1916 by the Rutland Railroad and in service for 35 years, it is a well-preserved reminder of the importance of the railroad through the area. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. It presently houses a restaurant. Description and history The former East Clarendon Railroad Station stands in central eastern Clarendon, at the triangular junction of Route 103 and East Clarendon Road. The latter road roughly parallels the tracks of the Rutland Railroad, an active freight line. The station originally stood between the road and the tracks, about southeast of its present location, to which it was moved in 1953. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a broad hip roof that provides large overhangs, supported by triangular knee brackets. Its exterior is finished with a combination of wooden clapboards and bead boarding. The former agent's office is a small projection on the east side of the building. The interior retains its original three-room configuration, with a waiting room (now dining room), agent's office (now the lunch counter), and the freight room (kitchen). Interior finishes are either restored originals, or have been covered over to preserve them. The rail line passing through East Clarendon was built in 1849, and is one of Vermont's oldest. This station was built about 1916 to provide passenger and freight service to the community, and was in service until 1953. Traffic on the line was stopped entirely in 1963, but has since been revived. The station was relocated to this site from its original location in after it was closed, but was not mounted on a permanent foundation until 1996, when it was given a major restoration and restaurant conversion.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Architecture and history The Old Brick Church stands in the village center of East Montpelier, on a parcel bounded on the south by US Route 2, the east by Vermont Route 14, and the west by Quaker Road. Its walls are brick laid in American bond, and its foundation is cut granite. It is 1-1/2 stories in height, with a gabled roof from which a square tower rises. The tower's first stage has corner pilasters rising to an entablature and cornice, while the second houses the belfry, with louvered rectangular openings, corner pilasters, and surrounding entablature above. An eight-sided steeple completes the tower. The front facade is oriented to the southwest, and is symmetrical. It is four bays wide, with sash windows in most bays, and two entrances in the center two bays of the ground floor. In the gable above is a recessed panel that has a triangular louver at the center. The interior has original slip pews facing the pulpit on the rear wall. The pulpit is original, but was at first located on the front wall, from which it was moved during renovations in the early 20th century. with The village of East Montpelier was settled in 1825, and this church was built in 1833-34 on land donated by Arthur Daggett. The building team was led by Truman and Stillman Kelton, and included men who later worked on the Vermont State House. It was built as a union meeting house, serving both Congregationalist Unitarians and Methodists. About 1858, the Methodists withdrew from use of the building. Between 1940 and 1951 it was reduced to having only summer services, but has since held services year- round.

The organization is member and grant supported. History Missouri Coalition for the Environment (MCE) was founded in 1969 out of a convention at the Missouri Botanical Garden. The group served as Missouri's first citizen-based action group. By 1971 MCE had become a more solid organization, with a permanent group of board members. The founders came from diverse backgrounds. Notable figures such as Lewis Green and Leo Drey had strong background knowledge of environmental issues and implemented practical resolutions. > \\"... since its founding by such distinguished luminaries as Leo A.

Green and Emily Ullman, . . .the > Coalition has been an ever present champion for the development of rational > and effective environmental programs.\\" > Buzz Westfall, St. Louis County Executive, October 1994 The 1970s Shortly after the organization began, they took on Union Electric and their plans to build a nuclear power plant in Callaway County, MO. The Callaway Nuclear Generating Station was to become Missouri's first nuclear plant. MCE opposed the idea of nuclear power but construction of the plant could not be stopped. In 1976, MCE launched a campaign to prohibit a Union Electric rate increases that would force customers to pay for construction work in progress (CWIP). Due to MCE's efforts, an anti-CWIP law was passed with a 2 to 1 vote, but MCE's fight against the plant was not over. In 1980, MCE testified during Public Service Commission hearings on a plan to build a second reactor. Two weeks following the trial the plans were canceled. In 1978 MCE began to get involved with Forest Park. Plans were announced to relocate the St. Louis Science Center to park's south side. MCE opposed. Although the Science Center was eventually built, MCE was influential in the planning process. During this same period plans were made to expand parking for the old Arena into the park during the 1970s, MCE opposed them. The campaign was a success and no green space was lost to the Arena, which was demolished about 20 years later. The Earth City floodplain on the Missouri River in west St. Louis County was another major issue for Missouri Coalition for the Environment during the 1970s. In 1971, MCE filed a lawsuit against floodplain development, winning a seminal ruling prohibiting development below the high-water mark without a federal permit. The lawsuit also resulted in a decree preserving the land between the Earth City levee and the Missouri River as open space. The case was used a precedent in many other decisions involving the Corps of Engineers and development in flood plains since the court decision forced the Corp to extend their jurisdiction. the 1980s During the 1980s floodplains were threatened again when plans to build a large sports stadium on the Maryland Heights floodplain surfaced. The large dome would have housed a majority of St. Louis's sporting events, causing not only harm to the floodplain itself but also producing a large amount of commuter pollution and moving attractions from downtown. MCE was able to prevent construction and pave the way for a new stadium in the city with a much smaller environmental impact. In 1997, MCE launched a campaign to keep the Horseshoe Casino out of the area. Eventually, a federal court order was won, prohibiting the Nevada casino from docking a gambling boat at Earth City. The 1990s During the early 1990s MCE's focus shifted back to Forest Park. In 1992, MCE led a campaign against Proposition 1 which would have allowed for the expansion of Art Museum parking. The proposition failed and over of the Forest Park were saved. During the late 1990s the Coalition closely followed the development of the Forest Park's Master Plan and objected to all instances which would cause environmental harm. Campaigns were launched to support ideas such as a free flowing river, restoration of wetlands and prairies, protection of native plant and animal species and the introduction of a savannah in Kennedy forest. These ideas, incorporated into the final, have now become reality. 2000- Present When high levels of dangerous lead contamination were recognized in the town of Herculaneum, Missouri in 2001, residents contacted the MCE, who began to monitor the situation in addition to smelter emissions. It was discovered that trucks carrying lead concentrate to the smelter were responsible for spreading the contaminants. The EPA then began to enforce the national lead air standard, which forced Doe Run, the smelter's owner, to clean up the area and buy out the homes nearest the plant. In 2005, the Coalition won a 2004 lawsuit on behalf of two Herculaneum residents prompted by the EPA's failure to review lead air pollution standards every five years as required by the Clean Air Act. The courts then ordered the EPA to conduct a decades-overdue review. The Coalition mobilized the children's health community to ensure that the new standard was protective in order to counter industry lobbyists who pushed the EPA to remove the standard all together. During the review process, Kat Logan Smith, executive director of MCE, and Leslie Warden, a former Herculaneum resident, testified at the EPA's clean air scientific advisory panel in North Carolina. The review resulted in a new standard that is ten times more protective than the one it replaced. It will go into effect between 2010 and 2013 and be emulated around the globe. In 2004, the Coalition reached a landmark settlement with the EPA that required a major overhaul of the state's water quality standards, including new recreational-use protections for of streams and improved protections for the Current River, Jacks Fork and Eleven Point River. Prior to the settlement, more than 90% of the state's surface waters were not required to be clean enough for safe recreational use. MCE continues to press for strong water quality standards and Clean Water Act protections for the remaining of small streams that the state currently deems \\"unclassified\\". MCE belongs to the Mississippi River Collaborative (), a coalition of organizations working together to reduce pollution into the Mississippi River and its tributaries and to reduce the Dead Zone in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2008, MCE defended consumers from another proposed CWIP rate hike in a follow-up attempt by Ameren UE to building a second reactor at the Callaway Nuclear Generating Station in Callaway County, Missouri. MCE started a new program called Renew Missouri to promote clean, renewable energy. Renew Missouri and the MCE led a successful campaign educating voters on the costs and employment impacts of Proposition C, the Clean Energy Initiative. On November 4, 2008, Missouri voters approved the measure that requires investor-owned utilities to obtain at least 15% of their power from renewable sources by 2021. Currently, MCE is working to educate the public through events like the Green Homes Festival and statewide clean energy forums in which community members and public officials have a chance to learn about clean energy solutions. Timeline 1969 The Coalition for the Environment was founded out of the St. Louis Conference on the Environment held at the Missouri Botanical Garden on June 5. 1971 The Coalition filed a landmark lawsuit against major floodplain development, winning a seminal ruling prohibiting development below the high-water mark without a federal permit and a decree preserving the land between the Earth City levee and the Missouri River as open space. 1976 The Coalition led a successful statewide campaign to prevent utility companies from charging ratepayers for construction work in progress (CWIP) with a 2 to 1 vote. 1980 The Coalition intervened in Public Service Commission hearings on Union Electric's plans to build two nuclear power reactors in Callaway County. After two weeks of hearings, the second reactor was canceled, saving ratepayers millions of dollars and reducing the generation of dangerous radioactive wastes. 1984 The Coalition helped draft the Missouri State Superfund Law and assisted in its passage with the aid of its full-time lobbyist in Jefferson City. 1987 The Coalition's federal lawsuit blocked St. Louis County's effort to build a 70,000-seat sports stadium in the floodplain in Maryland Heights, paving the way for a stadium to be built downtown to augment Convention Center facilities. 1992 Working in concert with Citizens to Protect Forest Park, the Coalition enabled St. Louis voters to reject Art Museum plans to expand the building and construct parking lots in Forest Park. 1993 After several years of effort, the Coalition, led by Leo Drey, helped to ensure that Greer Spring will be protected from development by assisting in the passage of a federal law adding this second largest Missouri spring to the Eleven Point Wild and Scenic River system and transferring the surrounding to the federal government to be maintained in its natural state. 1997 Missouri Coalition for the Environment won a lawsuit in the Missouri Supreme Court which returns the executive branch of the state government the right to determine how legislation is enforced. The coalition also won a federal court order prohibiting a Nevada casino from harboring a gambling boat at Earth City and transporting 15,000 gamblers each day across the protected open space between the levee and the Missouri River. 1998 The Coalition joined with the Sierra Club in a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to enforce clean air regulations in the St. Louis area; St. Louis had failed to meet the federal standards for ozone or smog since 1978. This fight continued for four years until a decision is finally reached that the EPA must bring St. Louis up to standards. 2004 The Coalition reached a settlement with the EPA that required a major overhaul of the state's water quality standards, including new recreational-use protections for of streams and improved protections for the Current, Jacks Fork and Eleven Point rivers. Prior to the settlement more than 90% of the state's surface waters were not required to be clean enough for safe recreational use. 2005 The Coalition won a 2004 lawsuit on behalf of two Herculaneum residents prompted by the EPA's failure to review lead air pollution standards every five years as required by the Clean Air Act.

It will go into effect between 2010 and 2013 and be emulated around the globe. 2008 The Coalition led a successful campaign educating voters on the costs and employment impacts of Proposition C, the Clean Energy Initiative. On November 4, Missouri voters approved the measure that requires investor-owned utilities to obtain at least 15% of their power from renewable sources by 2021.

On November 4, 2008, a majority of Missouri voters approved the measure that requires utilities to obtain 15% of their power from renewable sources by 2021. On October 15, 2008, in the culmination of a Coalition lawsuit, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established a new standard for the amount of the toxic metal lead allowed in air. The new standard is ten times more protective of public health than the one it replaces. On August 31, in response to the Coalition's legal work on the Clean Water Act, the Missouri Dept. of Natural Resources began to implement a long-neglected but critical provision in the Clean Water Act known as \\"anti-degradation\\" that will help keep clean streams clean.

Built in 1823-26, it is the oldest church building in the greater Montpelier area, and a well-preserved example of Federal period church architecture. It served as a union church for multiple denominations for many years, and housed the annual town meetings until 1849. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It is now home to a non- denominational community congregation. Description and history The Old Meetinghouse stands near the geographic center of the township that is now divided into Montpelier and East Montpelier. It stands on the south side of Center Road, a short way west of its junction with Brazier Road. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and stone foundation. A two-bay entry vestibule projects from the center of the front facade, and a tower rises astride the main ridge and that of the vestibule. The tower's square base includes a louvered upper section, and is capped by a cornice and balustrade. The next two stages are octagonal and decreasing in size, with a bellcast roof and spire at the top. There are two entrances in the projecting pavilion, framed by simple corner boards and topped by cornices, with small sash windows directly above. The fully pedimented gable of the projection has a Federal style fan at the center. with The church was built in 1823-26 on land given by Parley Davis, the area's first surveyor and settler, as a town common. Davis had hoped that the area would become Montpelier's town center. The building was used for services by a number of congregations of different denominations, and hosted Montpelier's town meetings until 1849, when East Montpelier was separated. It held some of East Montpelier's town meetings until 1890, when its first town hall was built. Use of the building by religious groups declined in the early 20th century, but was revived in 1965 with the formation of the non-denominational Old Meeting House Society.

On 24 November 1827 he was elected Bishop of Rochester, receiving back the temporalities on 14 December 1827, and on 19 March 1828 was appointed Dean of Worcester, being succeeded in 1845 by John Peel. While commending the character of the leaders of the Oxford Movement, Murray attacked some of the Tracts for the Times, especially Nos. 81 and 90, in his episcopal charge of October 1843. Several of his sermons and charges were published.

It is of national significance as the origin point of the Home Prayers program, essentially a mail-order ministry inspired by the catalogs of Sears, Roebuck. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Description and history The Beaver Meadow Union Chapel stands on the north side of Beaver Meadow Road, just west of the crossroads village of West Norwich. It is a simple single-story wood frame structure, with a steeply pitched gable roof, clapboard siding, and stone foundation. A square tower rises from the roof near the front, with an open belfry capped by a pyramidal roof. The main facade has an unadorned entrance at the center, with simply framed sash windows on either side, and above in the belfry. A kitchen ell extends to the left of the main building. The interior retains many of its original finishes and furnishings. The church was built in 1915 at the instigation of Margaret Kerr, a New York City schoolteacher who agitated for its construction after a drunken brawl occurred in front of her home. The site on which it was built originally had a Methodist church on it; it had been moved to Sharon. The church was built by its future congregants, and was served by ministers operating from nearby Hanover, New Hampshire, mainly during the warmer months. One of them, Rev. Allen W. Clark, seized upon the idea of mailing written elements of a service (including lessons and sermon) to congregants in periods when the church was not in service. This idea grew into the Home Prayers program, which had more than 23,000 subscribers from 850 churches when Clark retired in 1977.

Built in 1891, it is one of the only churches in the state built in a fully mature expression of Shingle Style architecture. Its Congregationalist congregation was organized in 1806, and in 1930 it merged with a Methodist congregation to form a union congregation. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description and history The United Church of Ludlow is located on the south side of Ludlow village, in a densely built residential area, at the northwest corner of Pleasant and Elm Streets. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a slate roof, shingled exterior, and mortared fieldstone foundation. It is basically rectangular, with a slightly projecting cross gable on the long sides giving it a cross shape. A circular tower at the southeast corner of the cross rises to an colonnaded open belfry, topped by a bellcast shingled roof. The main entrance faces Pleasant Street, recessed in an opening flanked in antis by Tuscan columns. The interior of the church retains many original features. with The First Congregational Church of Ludlow was organized in 1806, and first met in private homes. Its first meeting house was built the following year, and was replaced by a second in 1839. This church, its third sanctuary, was built in 1891-92 to a design by New York City architect Edward T. Hapgood. It is believed to be the only full expression of the Shingle style in religious architecture in the state, other examples either including features from earlier styles (the Queen Anne and Stick styles) or later periods (the Colonial Revival). The cost of the design work was donated by Donald Heald, a noted advocate of fire-resistant construction; it is thus unusual that a wood- frame building (originally with a roof of wooden shingles) was proposed.

He was a young male bear character based on the Steiff teddy bear that was popular at the time. His friends were Ruby Rabbit and Maisie Mouse. Later Percy Porker the pig became a regular character as well as Freddy Fox on occasion. He was the first bear to appear as a cartoon character, pre- dating Rupert Bear by a year. The Annuals There were annuals issued from the early 1920s, in small format thin paperback volumes which collected their adventures. These are known to exist as year-dated annuals 1923 to 1926, and 1928-31. The 1923 annual states inside that it is their 'third book', so two more exist from 1920-1922. The cover price was fixed at 'One Shilling' on the 1923-1931 annuals. The 1923-30 Annuals were by Kitsie Bridges (Aunt Kitsie) and pictures by Dora McLaren. The 1931 annual drawings were by 'Meg'. The 1932 annual had some 'Meg' drawings and some by Wilfred Haughton, and was the last one edited by Aunt Kitsie. For the 1933 to 1939 annuals, they were all drawn and written by Wilfred Haughton who also created the early Mickey Mouse annuals, also for Deans, from 1930 to 1939. He rarely signed his work, though his style is very distinctive. By 1939 Wilfred Haughton had fallen out with Deans as he would not draw Mickey Mouse for the Mickey Mouse comics in a more modern style. He appears to have left Deans entirely by then as Bobby Bear is created by a different unnamed artist starting with the 1940 annual. The only annual featuring his drawings with his signature is the 1936 one. The annuals from 1932 became very elaborate by the mid-1930s with multiple colour plates and many pages to cut out, which makes the later 1930s ones hard to find complete. The most unusual Wilfred Haughton story appeared in the 1936 Annual, entitled 'Mr Nobody' which was about a bear who had no body. Several surreal pictures of the head being carried about and then the headless body running around and eventually the two were matched up. The 1931 Annual shows '1931' on the cover, but is misprinted '1930' on the first page. The 1932-34 ones are dated on the front cover. 1935 with 'Lucky Dip 6d'; 1936 with 'Never Lets You Down'; 1937 with 'Lets All Be Merry' are only dated on the title page. 1938 with 'Out For Fun Again' and 1939 with 'Rattling Good!' on the cover are undated. The 1939 Annual is usually found missing a lot of the pages: page 48 had a Donkey & Sergeant cutout; pages 73‚Äì80 had a 'Punch & Judy' cut-out & play and page 98 a Racing Car cutout. Later books can be dated via the ComicsUK website 'Annual Gallery' linked below. Bobby Bear Club The 'Bobby Bear Club' started in the early 1930s, similar to Pip, Squeak and Wilfred and Teddy Tail clubs, and the 1932 annual states that over 400,000 members had joined. You received a 'Secret Rules' booklet revealing the secret sign to make to fellow 'Bear Cubs' which involved putting your first finger and thumb together to make an 'O' and putting both hands to make 'OO' like eyes. There was a salute and a 'Call and Rally' tune as well as a Club Recruiting Song. You could also get Free Insurance against personal accidents if aged between 6 and 16, and the motto was 'Make Friends'. You also received a numbered admittance card and a yearly Birthday Card. Starting with the 1940 annual, different artists drew the characters resulting in variations in style through the decades, with Bobby Bear being aimed at very young children by the 1960s. The 'Golden Years' of this character are the 1932-1939 annuals, with the pre-1932 annuals having solely Bobby Bear content.

Catherine's Hill is locally referred to as the section of the Black's Woods Road (Route 182 between Franklin and Cherryfield) which summits near the mountain, the rise ending a short distance from Fox Pond. Both are named after a legendary woman named Catherine, whose ghost is said to haunt the hill.  Legend of Catherine's Ghost  Travelers who claim to have seen Catherine's ghost on the hill most commonly describe a woman approaching the traveler asking for a ride, sometimes to Bar Harbor. Catherine is said to be dressed in a light blue evening or ball gown. Travelers who decline the ghost's request suffer various consequences. Purportedly Catherine was traveling on the road with her husband or boyfriend, after their wedding or prom night in Bar Harbor, when they were in some kind of accident (that it was a car accident is belied by the fact that the \\"Catherine's Hill\\" moniker predates the widespread use of cars in the area, at least back to the 1930s). It is said that Catherine lost her head in the accident, that her significant other was never found, and that Catherine wanders Catherine's Hill and the Black's Woods area searching for her head and her missing love. In Downeast folklore, there are other reputed stories dating as far back as the colonial period; some alleged that the eponymous Catherine was a witch, executed nearby, or a local girl lost to the supernatural forces of the region. Some argue that the hill was named for a landholder's wife, or another yet undocumented historical figure. Historically, the area has long been considered part of some of the most rural territory as it is a distance from the historic routes along the coast and surrounded by the Schoodic Foothills, thick forests, as well as bogs, fens, marshes and creeks. The book Dark Woods, Chill Waters: Ghost Tales from Down East Maine contains several variations on the legend. It also includes testimony suggesting that the Catherine legend may have been based on an entirely uneventful evening in the life of one Catherine Downing, d. December 29, 1862. Catherine Mountain is adjacent to both Schoodic Mountain and Black Mountain, forming a trifecta of three large highlands in the midst of the Schoodic area of Downeast Maine. Considered part of the Schoodic Foothills region, Blacks Woods and Catherine Mountain are part of the more specific area referred to as the ‚ÄúDowneast Outback‚Äù, being further inland. Local features include the Blacks Woods, Martin Ridge, Fox Pond, Spring River Lake, and various scenic spots dotting the Route 182 corridor between Franklin's Rabbittown hamlet and the village of Cherryfield.

The interior has a vestibule with stairs leading to a choir loft, and features original box pews in the main sanctuary. It no longer has its original raised pulpit, which was probably removed during renovations in the 1880s. with The town of Bethel was chartered in 1779, and an Episcopal congregation including the town was organized in 1794. It met for nearly twenty years in a variety of facilities, mostly those of its parishioners or of a schoolhouse that stood on the site of the present church. This church was built in 1823-24 by Colonel David Warren on land donated by Simeon Chase, who spearheaded the drive for its construction. It is one of Vermont's finest examples of a pure high Federal style church. Enrollment declined as churches in town centers were built, and the building was sold in 1852 to a Methodist congregation.

Its c. 1842 organ was built by William Nutting, Jr., a self-taught organ maker from nearby Bethel. Much of the building's stained glass dates to the 1880s and later, when the interior underwent some restyling to meet Victorian fashion trends. The congregation was always relatively small, and typically shared a minister with other nearby churches. Public outcry stopped one call for its deconsecration in the early 1970s, but it was finally closed by the diocese in 1996.

According to the site's About Us http://musosguide.com/about-us page, \\"it was launched for a number of reasons, namely the lack of coverage of classic music alongside new releases, the oh- so-obvious press release drivel in a lot of music mags at the time, the desire to create a website full of city guides with music tourists in mind and the desire to get to listen to promo CDs all day. \\"In November 2012 ownership of the site passed from Holly to Joe Watson and long-time contributor Kenny McMurtrie with a view to maintaining the already high quality of coverage and expanding the site‚Äôs reach. We still want to cover the classics and the best new music. We still bristle at the press release drivel and regurgitated guff but city guides have died a death. Now we listen to Radio 6 all day and have resurrected our Underexposed tab to get closer to the grass roots of the music scene.

The corps competed in Drum Corps International (DCI) as well as in several regional circuits but ceased operations following the 2009 season. History Founded in 1965, the corps persisted for many years, sometimes competing on the field in the Eastern organizations that formerly existed, such as Drum Corps East, E-Mass, and the Garden State Circuit, and in other years, performing only as a parade unit. In its early years, the corps competed in Class A. Citations had a few years of competitive success, but was mostly an average local corps that barely managed to continue. The 1986 corps finished as the DCI 6th place Class A Finalist, but the following season, the corps disappeared from the national scene for several years. When DCI created Class A60 for corps with 60 members or less, Citations moved into the new class, usually placing around the middle of the group which was later renamed Division III. After going inactive in 2001, the corps struggled for a few years, although they had a highlight of performing at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. In 2007, the corps traveled to DCI's first California Championships in Pasadena, placing 10th of 15 Division III corps. In 2008, DCI combined Divisions II & III. In the new Open Class, Citations grew in size, and the corps' performance quality improved significantly. The corps finished 6th of 23 Open Class Corps in Michigan City and Bloomington, Indiana. For the 2009 season, Citations placed third of 19 corps at Michigan City and finished in third place in the Open Class Finals at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. Despite the corps' newfound success, the Citations were but one of many North American drum corps that fell victim to the Great Recession of 2007‚Äì09. The corps went inactive after returning home from Indianapolis and folded soon after.

The maximum size of the male fish is about 50 cm females are about 10‚Äì18 cm total length. The coloration of the fish is dark olive-gray or brown above, with a silver side, and white below. The longitudinal stripes are often diffuse, and are rarely with dark dorsal-lateral blotches. The caudal peduncle is not pencil-like, its length is less than its head length; the fins are small to moderate in size, sometimes convex, and are rarely curved, with inter-radial membranes of fins variously pigmented. Scales are developed and cover the entire body, with the basal radii variable. There are 73-83 lateral scales, with usually 8 dorsal and anal fin rays, and rarely 7 or 9 fin rays.Minckley, W.L. and B.D. DeMarais, 2000. Taxonomy of Chubs (Teleostei, Cyprinidae, Genus Gila) in the American Southwest with comments on conservation. Copeia, 2000(1), pp. 251-256. Similar species include the humpback chub (Gila cypha) and bonytail chub (G. elegans), however, these fish have extremely slender caudal peduncles, smaller eyes, angle along anal fin base continuing above the caudal fin. Large individuals have a hump on their nape, and a depressed head which is absent on the headwater chub. Gila nigra are somewhat trout-like in appearance, except they lack an adipose fin. Not surprisingly, they are morphologically intermediate between the roundtail chub (Gila robusta) and the Gila chub (Gila intermedia). Range Headwater chubs are endemic to the Gila River basin of Arizona and New Mexico where they occupy the middle and headwater reaches of middle-sized streams. Populations have been recognized from the mainstream Gila River (above confluence with Mangus Creek) in New Mexico, this includes West, Middle and East forks of the Gila River, along with the San Carlos River (a tributary to the Gila). They are also identified from Ash Creek (tributary to San Carlos River), Tonto Creek (tributary to the Salt River), and Spring Creek, (tributary of Tonto Creek). In the Verde River system, they inhabit Upper Fossil Creek (above the diversion dam), East Verde River and Deadman Creek.Bestgen, K.R. and D.L. Probst. 1989. Distribution, status and notes on the ecology of Gila robusta in the Gila River drainage, New Mexico. The Southwestern Naturalist 34(3): pp 402-412.Animal Abstract:Gila nigra. Compiled by the Heritage Data Management System, Arizona Game and Fish Department, 2003. Habitat Adult headwater chub occupy cool to warm water in mid- to headwater stretches of mid-sized streams of the Gila River basin. They are associated with deep, near shore pools adjacent to swift riffles and runs, and near obstructions. Cover consists of root wads, boulders, undercut banks, submerged organic debris, or deep water. In Fossil Creek, they were found in water more than 1.8 m deep with velocities under 0.10 meters per second. Substrates they are associated with include gravel, small boulders, and large in-stream objects. Preferred water temperature ranges of 20-27 ¬∞C with a minimum temperature around 7 ¬∞C. Juveniles are associated with shallow, low velocity habitat with overhead cover. In Fossil Creek, headwater chub seem to select depths between 0.9-1.5 m and velocities of 0.15 meters per second and are found over sand substrate.Voeltz, J.B. 2002. Roundtail Chub (‚ÄúGila robusta‚Äù) status survey of the Lower Colorado River Basin. AGFD Nongame and Endangered Wildlife Program Technical Report #186, Arizona Game and Fish Department. Phoenix, Arizona. pp. 221. The headwater chub are associated with substrates including gravel, small boulders, and large in-stream objects. The preferred water temperature ranges of the headwater chub are 20-27 ¬∞C with a minimum temperature around 7 ¬∞C. Juveniles are associated with shallow, low velocity habitat with overhead cover. In Fossil Creek, they seem to select depths between 0.9-1.5 m and velocities of 0.15 mps and are found over sand substrate. The headwater chub life span is 8‚Äì10 years. They grow rapidly but growth is dependent on water temperature. The maximum size of the fish is about 50 cm.  Population trends  As with many native fish, reductions in range and numbers are likely the result of habitat loss, as well as competition with, and predation by, non- native fish species.  Management factors  Activities that are known to be detrimental to populations should be avoided, including dewatering of habitats through re-routing stream water, stream impoundment, channelization, domestic livestock grazing, timber harvesting, mining, road construction, polluting, and stocking non-native fish. *Threats: aquifer pumping; stream diversion; reduction in stream flows; predation by and competition with nonnative fishes. *Management needs: watershed and stream flow protection; research to determine mechanisms of disappearance; ameliorate effects of deleterious nonnative fishes.  Protective measures taken  This species is currently being considered for T & E listing by the US Fish and Wildlife Service.

The back, breast, and part of the belly are embedded with small scales, naked in some individuals. The length of the head divided by the depth of the caudal peduncle typically results in a ratio of 4.0 to 5.0 (rarely exceeding 5.0, which approximates G. elegans). The scales are typically lacking basal radii or are with extremely faint lines. Range It is restricted to the Virgin River in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. Another sizable population is found in the upper and middle reaches of the Muddy River in Nevada. The Arizona range of the Virgin chub is restricted to the Virgin River within Mohave County. Habitat In its native habitat, it occurs only in the mainstream of the Virgin and Muddy Rivers (Water within these rivers are generally somewhat warm, turbid, and saline), and very rarely in the immediate mouths of its major tributaries. The Virgin chub is most common in deeper areas where waters are swift, but not turbulent, and most often is associated with boulders or other types of cover.Minckley, W.L. 1973. Fishes of Arizona. Arizona Game and Fish Department, Phoenix. pp. 103-104.  Population trends  The Virgin chub is continuing to decline. In 1988 an attempt to remove red shiners (which are a common competitor with the Virgin chub) from 35 km of habitat on the Virgin River, ended in failure as populations of Virgin chub continued to be decimated by other factors including habitat modifications.  Management factors  Activities that are known to be detrimental to Virgin chub populations are the de-watering of habitats through the re-routing of stream water, stream impoundment, channelization, domestic livestock grazing, timber harvesting, mining, road construction, polluting, and stocking non-natives. Threats: widespread modification and reduction of habitat; dewatering by agricultural diversion; increased temperature, salinity, and turbidity of the Virgin River; introduction of non-native fish and parasite species. Management needs: protect and enhance habitat, including water quantity and quality; ameliorate effects of nonnative fish species in chub waters; re-establish additional populations. Hybrid origin The Virgin chub likely evolved via introgressive hybridization between the roundtail chub, G. robusta, and the bonytail chub, G. elegans. Evidence for a hybrid origin of the Virgin chub is based on morphology and allozymes. The mitochondrial DNA of the Virgin chub is nearly identical to that of G. elegans.DeMarais, B.D., T.E.

It rises 8 storeys above the intersection of South May and George Streets. Originally built in 1928 as a hotel, it was highly successful until the 1970s. It sat vacant until 1985, when it was renovated into a 64-unit low-income housing facility. Today it is owned by Habib Enterprises which operates it as a private sector apartment building. It was added to the Thunder Bay Heritage Register in 1988.City of Thunder Bay - Heritage Registry. Retrieved November 20, 2009.  History  In response to a growing economy, the need for a larger hotel in the city of Fort William became a point of discussion in 1927. The community had hoped one of the national railways would construct a grand hotel in the city for some time, but eventually took the initiative to build a hotel themselves. Led by local businessman Norman M. Paterson, 800 members of the community raised $419,000 in several months and construction of the hotel commenced in 1928. Upon completion in 1929, the hotel had 105 rooms, each with an ensuite, with an additional 21 \\"sample rooms\\" available for day rentals. The hotel featured a large kitchen, dining space for 150 people, a banquet hall, ballroom and convention space.Royal Edward Arms. Retrieved November 20, 2009. The hotel was owned by Fort William Hotels Limited,Thunder Bay Historical Museum Society Index of Business and Labour Holdings. Retrieved November 20, 2009. and operated successfully for many years. Notable guests include Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles, Governor General Roland Michener, Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, Gene Autry, and George Hees. However, by the end of the 1970s the hotel was no longer feasible and closed its doors. The Royal Edward sat vacant for several years and almost faced demolition, but was saved when a non-profit housing corporation obtained the funds to renovate the building into apartments. The renovations were led by architectural firm Ranta and Tett, and cost $2,478,305. It was operated by the Thunder Bay District Housing Corporation under a lease from the City of Thunder Bay. The lease expired on July 31, 2015. The City of Thunder Bay sold the building to a company owned by Asanhul Habib, a local architect, for $500,000. It is now operated as a private sector apartment building. Mr. Habib has announced plans to convert the building back to its original use as a hotel.  Architecture  Minneapolis architectural firm Dorr and Dorr was hired to design the building, and local architect R. E. Mason was hired as the contractor. The building was constructed using the slipform method, where concrete is poured into a mold that can rise with the structure as construction progresses, resulting in a seamless reinforced concrete structure. Like most buildings from the era, the windows are small relative to the surface of the walls. The subtle Art Deco detailing of the building is intended to express the continuity of the homogeneous mass. Vertical details rise between the windows, with a geometric pattern repeated between windows on the second floor.Ontario Architecture.com - Art Deco. Retrieved November 20, 2009. While it appears to have a stucco fa√ßade, the exterior surface of the building is part of the concrete structure itself. The top of the building features Gothic inspired detailing. A modern addition was added in the 1960s. Renovations in 1980 were largely confined to the interior. Exterior work was limited to waterblasting and painting.

Location The Imperial estates in question are all from the Bagradas Valley region of Africa Proconsularis (modern day Tunisia, around c.50 km west of the ancient city of Carthage. The inscription from Henchir-Mettich (c.AD 116-117 Tenney Frank , A Commentary on the Inscription from Henchir Mettich in Africa The American Journal of Philology Vol. 47, No. 2 (1926), pp. 153-170.) consists in an adaptation of the Lex Manciana for the fundus Villa Magna Variana. Two additional inscriptions dealing with a similar subject matter, also in the same region, are known from Ain-elDjemala (Hadrianic period) and Ain Wassel c.AD 198-209). Inscription The Inscription from Henchir Mettich details the tenancy agreement for coloni tenant farmers on the Fundus Villae Magnae Variane (an Imperial estate). The content of the translationKehoe, D, 1988, Econonmics of Agriculture on Roman Imperial Estates in North Africa, Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht runs as follows: 1\\\\. Preamble - Identifies Licinius Maximus (an Equite) and Felicior (a freedman of Trajan) as the procurators who oversaw the establishment at Henchir-Mettich. 2\\\\. Authorisation to cultivate subseciva - Allows unusused land (subseciva) on this Imperial estate to be brought under cultivation under the following agreement. 3\\\\. Assessment of share rents - Tenants will pay rents in kind (i.e. part of the total crop) according to their own judgement. 4\\\\. Rents of subseciva - Rents are one third total crop of wheat, barley, wine and olive oil. Additional rents include one quarter or one fifth of beans and of honey if over five hives are owned. 5\\\\. Penalties - Beehives cannot be moved from the estate onto free land in order to avoid rent. 6\\\\. Incentives - No rents are charged on newly planted vines and figs for the first five years, and newly planted olive trees for the first ten years. 7\\\\. Grazing - An annual fee of 4 asses is payable per animal grazing on the land. 8\\\\. Damage - Avoidable damage to other tenants' crops is paid for by the offender. 9\\\\. Bequesting - Land under tenancy can be bequeathed to an heir in a legally binding contract. This clause intends to promote generational farming of the same land and thus further investment. 10\\\\. Confiscation - Land neglected and un-cultivated for two consecutive years will be reclaimed by the landlord. 11\\\\. Labour Services - In addition to rents, each tenant must supply two consecutive days labour for ploughing and two for harvesting, on top of a day supervising the livestock. Labour services could be seconded to slaves or retainers of the tenants. Sharecropping Subsistence farming for a family of six in the ancient world requires three hectares of land to provide crops and enough seed for the next year, though to include a one third payment to a landlord requires cultivation of at least five hectares of land. Sharecropping forces the colonii to cultivate their land with more effort to attain a minimum level of income than they would otherwise have to supply. It also allows the farmer to pass some of the risks involved in farming onto the landlord as a poor crop would mean lower rents.

Stebbins was born February 26, 1846, in Orleans County, New York, where he spent the first 23 years of his life on a farm. In 1869 he moved to Chicago, Illinois, which marked the beginning of his musical career. Background Stebbins became the musical director of Chicago's First Baptist Church in 1870, a position he held till the autumn of 1874, when he resigned to take up residence in Boston. During his residence in Chicago he became acquainted with Dwight L. Moody and Ira D. Sankey and also with Philip Paul Bliss and Major D. W. Whittle, both of whom early joined the great evangelistic movement inaugurated by Moody. Shortly after his move to Boston, Stebbins became the musical director of the Clarendon Street Baptist Church where Adoniram Judson Gordon was minister. In January 1876 he became the musical director of Tremont Temple, alongside George O. Lorimer. Moody's Direction In the summer of that year Stebbins had occasion to spend a few days with Moody at his home in Northfield, Massachusetts, and during his visit Moody persuaded him to enter evangelistic work under Moody's direction, which Stebbins did that autumn. Stebbins' first work in this connection was to organize the choir for the meetings which Moody and Sankey were to hold in the great building erected for them in Chicago and which were to continue through October, November, and December. During the remainder of the season Stebbins assisted other evangelists, and in the summer following he became one of the editors of Gospel Hymns and subsequently of the series of hymnbooks used by Moody during the remainder of his life. Afterward Stebbins became the sole editor of Northfield Hymnal. Stebbins married Elma Miller before commencing his musical career. When he began his evangelistic work, she became actively involved, assisting him most efficiently in his singing, besides conducting meetings and giving Bible readings for ladies. During the nearly 25 years of his association with Moody, Stebbins assisted Moody and Sankey in their work both in this country and abroad besides working with other evangelists, among whom were George F. Pentecost and Major Whittle. In the autumn of 1890, Stebbins, with his wife and son, went with Pentecost to India for a season of work among the English-speaking inhabitants of that country; and during their stay there Mr. and Mrs. Stebbins and their son gave services of song in several of the principal cities of the country. On their return home they gave services of song also in Egypt and Palestine and in Naples, Rome, Florence, Paris, and London. From the beginning of Moody's work in Northfield, Stebbins has been one of the leaders of the singing at the summer conferences there and was the only one having official connection with the work at all general conferences for their first 30 years. He was also the last surviving member of the original group of men Moody had associated with him in his evangelistic work including Sankey, Whittle, Bliss, and James McGranahan. Gatherings Regarding Stebbins' work, aside from his occupying important positions in churches and his leadership in the great movement with which he was connected for so many years, he was frequently engaged to lead the singing at international and state conventions of YMCA, Sunday schools, Christian Endeavor, and other religious gatherings. Among these gatherings were the two greatest of the Christian Endeavor conventions, one held in New York City's Madison Square Garden, at which there were 30 thousand delegates and one held in Boston when there were 50 thousand present. There was also the great Ecumenical Missionary conference held in Carnegie Hall and the 50th anniversary of the founding of the American YMCA, in Boston. During these years his voice was not only heard in leading others, but it was also in constant demand in solo singing and on many occasions in singing with Sankey and others. Legacy Stebbins was well equipped in the musical department of his work, as well as in the others, for he studied voice with some of the most celebrated teachers in the United States. Much as his voice was heard in different parts of the world, he is remembered foremost by the music which he composed, which has long survived him and demonstrated an appeal across time and cultural boundaries. Stebbins' lasting legacy, the hymns that have become gospel music classics. Among those are Jesus Is Calling, Jesus I Come, Have Thine Own Way, Lord, and Take Time to Be Holy.

Today it is the name of the archaeological site. History In the 3rd century BC, in this area lived the Illyrian tribe Jasi, whose name the Romans referred to later in calling this place Aquae Iasae, \\"Waters of the Jasi\\". The village Jasa, thanks to its springs of water, grew into a significant medical, ceremonial, cultural and economic center of Pannonia Superior. But the biggest boom was seen under the Roman Empire from the 1st to the 4th centuries. The public part of the Roman settlement was located on the highest terrace of the hill Vara≈ædin spa, today the park and archaeological site. The residential part of Aquae Iasae was on the terraces that descend to the foot of the hill in the foothills of the craft-established commercial and trade show facilities. At the end of 3rd century AD Aquae Iasae were ravaged during the incursion of the Goths, then, in the beginning of the 4th century, the thermae were restored by Emperor Constantine. The resort was completely ruined and deserted in the 4th century during the invasions of the Migration period. Archaeological excavation Intensive archaeological excavation and research have continued since 1953, under the Department of Ancient Archaeological Museum in Zagreb, led by professor Marcel Gorenc. Then in the spa park, discovered complex of Roman architecture from the 1st - 4th century CE, in area of 6000 m2. This circuit consisted of spa parts, which make up the building with swimming pools and the basilica, the Forum with porches located around the main thermal sources, and Capitol with the temples of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. The excavations at the site uncovered numerous remains: parts of swords, shields, knives, razors, imperial coins (which were thrown into the pool for good luck), many statues of nymphs (nymfus salutaris, the goddess of healing) and the well preserved marble pavement of the 2nd century. The most valuable finding is the statue of the goddess Minerva with a pedestal, was found in 1967 at the entrance to the temple. Minerva wears a legionary helmet, wields a copper spear and shield, and instead of hair has snakes (the pharmacy). This statue was built in the 2nd century in Poetovio, and had him make a councilor as a votive gift of healing. More recent research in the Forum has discovered the ancient spring-fed Roman pool. This pool has the dimensions of 8x13.5 meters and the depth is 2.6 meters. The natural source of the baths' thermal water, was fenced in by large stone blocks. So far, the only similar example of such a pool is known in the Roman settlement of Aquae Sulis (Bath) in England. Specific conditions of soil around the springs of water, and travertine deposits, have given rise to good preservation of Roman architecture, so that this complex is one of the best preserved Roman sites in Croatia.

Political decisions should be taken at a local level if possible, rather than by a central authority. The Oxford English Dictionary defines subsidiarity as the idea that a central authority should have a subsidiary function, performing only those tasks which cannot be performed effectively at a more immediate or local level. The word subsidiarity is derived from the Latin word subsidiarius and has its origins in Catholic social teaching.  Catholic social teaching  The origins of subsidiarity as a formal concept of Catholic social thought lie with Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler, who served as Bishop of Mainz in the mid- to late 19th Century.Michael J. Shuck, ‚ÄúEarly Modern Roman Catholic Social Thought, 1740-1890,‚Äù Modern Catholic Social Teaching: Commentaries and Interpretations, eds. Kenneth Himes, O.F.M., Lisa Sowle Cahill, Charles E. Curran, David Hollenbach, S.J., and Thomas Shannon (Washington, D.C.: Georgetown University Press, 2005), 112. It is most well-known, however, from its subsequent incorporation into Pope Pius XI‚Äôs encyclical Quadragesimo anno. This encyclical‚Äôs formulation of subsidiarity is the touchstone from which further interpretations tend to depart: \\"Just as it is gravely wrong to take from individuals what they can accomplish by their own initiative and industry and give it to the community, so also it is an injustice and at the same time a grave evil and disturbance of right order to assign to a greater and higher association what lesser and subordinate organizations can do. For every social activity ought of its very nature to furnish help to the members of the body social, and never destroy and absorb them.\\"Pope Pius XI, Quadragesimo anno, May 15, 1931, https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p- xi_enc_19310515_quadragesimo-anno_en.html, ¬ß79. As with many social encyclicals in the modern period, this one occurs in the historical context of the intensifying struggle between communist and capitalist ideologies, exactly forty years ‚Äì hence the title ‚Äì after the Vatican's first public stance on the issue in Rerum novarum. Promulgated in 1931, Quadragesimo anno is a response to German National Socialism and Soviet communism, on the one hand, and to Western European and American capitalist individualism on the other. It broke the surface of Catholic social teaching in this context, and it is helpful to keep this in mind. Gregory Beabout suggests that subsidiarity draws upon a far older concept as well: the Roman military term subsidium. He writes that ‚Äúthe role of the ‚Äòsubsidium‚Äô (literally, to sit behind) is to lend help and support in case of need.‚ÄùGregory R. Beabout, ‚ÄúChallenges to Using the Principle of Subsidiarity for Environmental Policy,‚Äù William and Mary Environmental Policy Review 28 (2004): 226. Employing Beabout's etymology, subsidiarity indicates that the higher social unit ought to ‚Äúsit behind‚Äù the lower ones to lend help and support in case of need. Another etymological interpretation states that subsidiarity literally means ‚Äúto ‚Äòseat‚Äô (‚Äòsid‚Äô) a service down (‚Äòsub‚Äô) as close to the need for that service as is feasible.‚Äù (cited in Robert K. Vischer, ‚ÄúSubsidiarity as a Principle of Governance: Beyond Devolution,‚Äù Indiana Law Review 35, no. 1 (2001): 103). Either interpretation indicates a hermeneutic of subsidiarity in which the higher social body‚Äôs rights and responsibilities for action are predicated upon their assistance to and empowerment of the lower. Francis McHugh states that in addition to the ‚Äúvertical‚Äù dimension of subsidiarity, there is also a ‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù dimension which ‚Äúcalls for a diversity of semi-autonomous social, economic, and cultural spheres.‚ÄùFrancis P. McHugh, Catholic Social Thought: Renovating the Tradition ‚Äì A Keyguide to Resources (Leuven: Peeters, 2008) 91. Quadragesimo anno presents these ‚Äúspheres‚Äù as occupying the space between the poles of individual and State: \\"...things have come to such a pass through the evil of what we have termed ‚Äúindividualism‚Äù that, following upon the overthrow and near extinction of that rich social life which was once highly developed through associations of various kinds, there remain virtually only individuals and the State. This is to the great harm of the State itself; for, with a structure of social governance lost, and with the taking over of all the burdens which the wrecked associations once bore. the State has been overwhelmed and crushed by almost infinite tasks and duties.\\"Quadragesimo anno, ¬ß78. These associations or ‚Äúlesser societies‚Äù are encouraged because they are the vehicle by which society functions most effectively and corresponds most closely with human dignity.For further elaboration, see Pope Leo XIII, Rerum novarum, May 15, 1891, https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/ documents/hf_l- xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum_en.html,, ¬ß48-51 and Quadragesimo anno, ¬ß29-39. Examples of these associations today would include the family, unions, nonprofit organizations, religious congregations, and corporations of all sizes. Subsidiarity charts a course between the Scylla of individualism and Charybdis of collectivism by locating the responsibilities and privileges of social life in the smallest unit of organization at which they will function. Larger social bodies, be they the state or otherwise, are permitted and required to intervene only when smaller ones cannot carry out the tasks themselves. Even in this case, the intervention must be temporary and for the purpose of empowering the smaller social body to be able to carry out such functions on its own.Robert K. Vischer, ‚ÄúSubsidiarity as a Principle of Governance: Beyond Devolution,‚Äù Indiana Law Review 35, no. 1 (2001): 119. (Quoting Fred Crosson, ‚ÄúCatholic Social Teaching and American Society,‚Äù Principles of Catholic Social Teaching, ed. David A. Boileau (Milwaukee: Marquette University Press, 1998), 170-171). The principle of subsidiarity was developed by German theologian and aristocrat Oswald von Nell-Breuning., cited in . His work influenced the social teaching of Pope Pius XI in Quadragesimo anno and holds that government should undertake only those initiatives which exceed the capacity of individuals or private groups acting independently. Functions of government, business, and other secular activities should be as local as possible. If a complex function is carried out at a local level just as effectively as on the national level, the local level should be the one to carry out the specified function. The principle is based upon the autonomy and dignity of the human individual, and holds that all other forms of society, from the family to the state and the international order, should be in the service of the human person. Subsidiarity assumes that these human persons are by their nature social beings, and emphasizes the importance of small and intermediate-sized communities or institutions, like the family, the church, labor unions and other voluntary associations, as mediating structures which empower individual action and link the individual to society as a whole. \\"Positive subsidiarity\\", which is the ethical imperative for communal, institutional or governmental action to create the social conditions necessary to the full development of the individual, such as the right to work, decent housing, health care, etc., is another important aspect of the subsidiarity principle. The principle of subsidiarity was first formally developed in the encyclical Rerum novarum of 1891 by Pope Leo XIII, as an attempt to articulate a middle course between laissez-faire capitalism on the one hand and the various forms of communism, which subordinate the individual to the state, on the other. The principle was further developed in Pope Pius XI's encyclical Quadragesimo anno of 1931, and Economic Justice for All by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. > It is a fundamental principle of social philosophy, fixed and unchangeable, > that one should not withdraw from individuals and commit to the community > what they can accomplish by their own enterprise and industry. (Pope Pius > XI, Quadragesimo anno, 79) Since its founding by Hilaire Belloc and Gilbert Keith Chesterton, Distributism, a third way economic philosophy based on Catholic Social teaching, upholds the importance of subsidiarity. As Christian Democratic political parties were formed, they adopted the Catholic social teaching of subsidiarity, as well as the neo-Calvinist theological teaching of sphere sovereignty, with both Protestants and Roman Catholics agreeing \\"that the principles of sphere sovereignty and subsidiarity boiled down to the same thing.\\" The Church's belief in subsidiarity is found in the programs of the Catholic Campaign for Human Development, where grassroots community organizing projects are supported to promote economic justice and end the cycle of poverty. These projects directly involve the people they serve in their leadership and decision-making.. Phillip Berryman considers the principle of subsidiarity to be essentially anarchistic.

It takes its name from the repeated polygon shapes incorporated in the designs, many of which resembled lozenges. In Germany it was called Buntfarbenaufdruck (multi-colored print) but this designation includes other camouflage designs such as Splittermuster and Leibermuster, and does not include hand-painted camouflage. Development During the early stages of the Great War, the Germans were looking for a way to effectively camouflage the aircraft of the Luftstreitkr√§fte to inhibit enemy observation of the aircraft while it was airborne and when on the ground. Large, irregular blotches with two or three colors were used on the upper surfaces of the wingBull, Stephen. Encyclopedia of military technology and innovation, p. 53.

Because painting such a pattern was very time consuming, and the paint added considerably to the weight of the aircraft, the patterns were printed on fabric, and the fabric was then used to cover the aircraft. This printed fabric was used in various forms and colors from late 1916 until the end of the war.Century of Flight. \\"Aviation During World War One\\". Retrieved on November 2, 2009. Use Lozenge camouflage appeared primarily on German aircraft along the Western Front but some air units of the Austro-Hungarian Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops used the pattern on the Eastern Front and on the Italian Front.Chant, Christopher. Austro-Hungarian Aces of World War 1, p. 94. Osprey Publishing, 2002. National markings such as the Balkenkreuz made camouflage less effective. Lozenge camouflage came in varying widths, sometimes in 4.5-foot-wide (1.4 m) bolts of fabric, and pieces were cut to fit between the leading and trailing edges of the wing. Fabric sections laid chordwise were lined up next to each other so that the pattern repeated itself regularly across the wing, except for the ailerons which were covered in fabric laid sparwise, perpendicular to the wing pattern. Some aircraft had the fabric applied diagonally. As a part of field repairs, regularly laid fabric patterns from the factory might be overlaid with the same pattern but at a different angle, or with fabric from a different camouflage design. Later in the war, some patterns were applied more quickly with fabric laid sparwise along the full wingspan. Hasty factory work began to resemble the rushed field repairs. Darker lozenge patterns were used for upper wing surfaces, while lighter ones were used for the undersides of the aircraft.Vossers, H. The Fokker D.VII File. \\"The Lozenge Camouflage Pattern.\\" Aerofile.info. Retrieved on November 2, 2009.

These aircraft were often hand-painted in similar but unrepeating patterns on their fuselages. The heaviest Riesenflugzeug were painted in lozenge patterns‚Äîthey were never covered in printed fabric. The Luftstreitkr√§fte's use of printed-lozenge on fighters The two most common types of pre-printed lozenge fabric used on day fighter aircraft were differentiated by the number of colors used in the pattern, and their similar patterns of polygonal shapes that defined them. The less common Vierfarbiger, or four-color lozenge pattern of 1.30 meter bolt width, and the more common F√ºnffarbiger, or five-color pattern of 1.345 meter bolt width, also had lighter color lower surface and darker color upper surface variations available for use. Two patterns have been named by historians from the surviving World War I-era German fighter aircraft that have had relatively intact examples of these lozenge coverings on them, each as the \\"type aircraft\\" that inspired the modern names for both the four and five color lozenge camouflage designs: the four-color fabric is called Knowlton from the intact Fokker D.VII on display with serial number D.VII(Alb) 6810/18 (built under license by Albatros Flugzeugwerke for the Fokker firm) in a museum located in the Knowlton suburb of Lac-Brome, Quebec; and the more often used five-color fabric is called Canberra, from the similarly intact Albatros D.Va fighter (serial number D.5390/17) at Canberra's Australian War Memorial. A five-color lozenge camouflage alternates with the pilot's personal color choice of pink on the fuselage of this Fokker D.VII reproduction. Its wing is covered in lozenge fabric. As with all camouflage, the need to hide or obscure the aircraft from the enemy was counterbalanced by the need to have friendly forces recognize the aircraft. Bold black and white Iron Cross or Balkenkreuz markings provided a way to quickly identify the aircraft and at the same time, such national markings' high contrast elements detracted from the effect of the camouflage. Further, individual pilots often added their own personal coloration to aircraft that they flew regularly.Franks, Norman and Greg VanWyngarden. Fokker Dr I aces of World War I, Volume 40 of Osprey Aircraft of the Aces. Osprey Publishing, 2001, Appendices. An individual might paint the nose and tail in bright, unique colors to distinguish him in the air from his squadron mates. All of these practices rendered the lozenge camouflage less effective. Flying aces such as Georg von Hantelmann painted their fighters with two goals: to display unit colors, and to show personal flair. Factory- applied lozenge camouflage was not seen as important. Hantelmann's Albatros D.V was decorated with a prominent death's head in white against the dark blue fuselage and red nose which indicated his unit, Jasta 15. Only the wings and rudder of his Albatros were laid with lozenge camouflage.Franks, Norman L. R. Albatros aces of World War I, Volume 32 of Osprey Aircraft of the Aces. Osprey Publishing, 2000, p. 39. Similarly, Ernst Udet, the second-highest scoring German ace of World War I, painted his Fokker D.VII bright red with bold white stripes and large white lettering on the rudder reading \\"Du doch nicht!!\\" (Lit: \\"Definitely not you!\\", Figuratively: \\"You may not!\\", or: \\"No you don't!\\" ) His aircraft ineffectively retained its lozenge camouflage on the upper surface of the lower wing.

The book is his first on the issue of voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide.  Overview Derek Humphry, a journalist on the London Sunday Times and author of Because They're Black, published Jean's Way in 1978. The book became a bestseller in the UK, was translated into eight languages, and has been reprinted 17 times.+ The 2003 printing in English by Norris Lane Press () is 160 pages and includes a new full-color jacket and updated preface. The 2003 English edition is available in paperback and eBook PDF formats. Jean's Way translations have been published in Finland, Norway, Hebrew, Japan, Poland, Spain, Mexico, France, Turkey and Germany.  Jean Humphry Jean Humphry was born Jean Edna Crane on March 23, 1932, in Hulme (Manchester), UK. Her family moved to Wythenshawe, a Manchester suburb, where Jean received a public school education. In 1951 Miss Crane was appointed 'Miss Wythenshawe', a volunteer task ceremoniously to open fetes, flower shows and exhibitions as the district had no Mayor. On May 4, 1953, Jean married Derek Humphry in Manchester. They had three sons, one adopted. She died March 29, 1975, in Langley Burrell, Wiltshire, as a consequence of breast cancer which had become carcinomatosis. Book summary At the time of the first publication's first edition, not only was assisted suicide against the law, it was also highly taboo. Jean Humphry had suffered for more than two years from breast cancer, which spread throughout her whole body, as described in the first nine chapters. She decided it was her time for an assisted death, and proceeded with her plan so that she could die in peace and dignity in her own home rather than in hospital. This was an individual decision; the couple did not know then (1975) about euthanasia and assisted suicide, which later became highly controversial as the right to die issue mushroomed. Living Wills were then just becoming known. Some nine months earlier, the couple had made a pact at Jean's instigation that she could take her life if she wished if the final weeks were unbearable to her. Jean had stipulated that she would only do it with Derek's agreement. At Jean's request, Derek secured a lethal overdose from a sympathetic doctor and stored it in a secure place in their home in Wiltshire. When the pain and distress became too great to bear, Jean asked for the drugs so that she could die. When she was ready, Derek mixed the lethal potion into a mug of coffee. After saying, \\"Goodbye, my love\\" Jean downed the drink and died within the hour. In Chapter 10, Is This the Day?, Derek describes her last day before her death.\\"Is This the Day?\\", Jean's Way - Chapter 10 On publication of the book, British police asked Derek if it was true, and he signed a statement to the effect that it was. But the Director of Public Prosecutions, who has discretion over assisted suicide laws, decided not to prosecute Derek. Post publication The popularity of Jean's Way started the movement to legalize assisted suicide as a choice for competent adults at the end of life. (Previously, the movement had concentrated solely on 'voluntary euthanasia' by direct injection.) Derek founded the Hemlock Society in 1980 to campaign for greater acceptance of justifiable assisted suicide and also wrote the international bestselling book Final Exit. In 1990, Jean's Way became the basis for a dramatic stage play entitled Is This the Day? written by Vilma Hollingbery. It had its world premiere at the Royal Theatre in Northampton, UK, and had short runs in Germany and the USA. The book foreshadowed the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, which Derek pioneered in 1986 and as a team player worked for its eventual passage in 1994. In the application of both Oregon law and Swiss law, with legally approved ways of assisting deaths at the end of life, Jean's Way is the method used. In Switzerland it is used by Dignitas and EXIT, the Swiss society for humane dying.Used by permission of Derek Humphry.

The meeting house, the third one on the site, was built by a group of Friends (\\"Quakers\\") from the Cape Cod region, Nantucket and Rhode Island in 1780. It was the largest meeting in the Hudson Valley, and many other meetings split off from it. Unusually, it was located near a developed area, and the Friends in it were more prosperous than their co-religionists elsewhere in the region. Its size and use of brick, along with several other architectural features, are unusual for meeting houses. Attendance at meetings dwindled over the course of the 19th century, and in 1897 control of the property was turned over to the Nine Partners Burial Ground Association. It is still used for occasional Quaker events, and is well preserved from the days of its regular use. In 1989 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of a Multiple Property Submission of Quaker meeting houses in Dutchess County. Page 109, Retrieved November 3, 2009 Buildings and grounds The meeting house and cemetery are located on a lot at the northeast corner of the road intersection. The undulating terrain slopes up gently towards the northeast. The surrounding properties are similar large lots, some wooded and others cleared, used for residential purposes. There are four contributing resources on the property. The meeting house itself is located at the southeast corner, with the cemetery taking up the north and west. Behind the meeting house are a garage and shed, both modern and non-contributing, with a contributing well and pumphouse closer to the cemetery. In front of it is a sundial, a contributing object. A fence with brick entrance gates runs along Route 343. The meeting house is a two-and-a-half-story four-bay structure with load-bearing brick and masonry walls on a stone foundation topped with a gabled roof pierced by brick chimneys at either end. Outside dimensions are 43' 8\\" () wide by 60' 5\\" () long and 35' 1¬Ω\\" () tall. The walls are 22¬æ\\" () thick. The bricks are laid with two stretcher course and one header course with half-inch (13 mm) joints of the original lime mortar. All facades feature double-hung sash windows with white louvered shutters. They are 12-over-12 pane glass except on the lower north wall, where they are 8-over-8. Most of sashes contain the original glazing. Two plain wooden doors give entrance between the windows on either end. Arched brick lintels are used over the windows and doors.

Each chamber has rows of wooden benches arranged around a central area, including an elevated Facing Bench where Weighty Friends would sit. A feature unique to Nine Partners among meeting houses in the area is the vestibule created later by building a lengthwise interior wall along the south side. In the central area there is a wood stove placed on a stone hearth and an oil lamp mounted on a post. Interior walls are original horsehair plaster and unpainted paneling. Wooden interior columns are rounded rather than chamfered as in other meetinghouses in Dutchess County. The second floor consists of a balcony, supported by the same post and beam framing as the roof, forming a gallery looking into the central area of each first floor chamber, divided in the same manner as the first floor. There is a provision to place wood planks over the gallery opening to the first floor, separating the second floor from the first floor completely.

The earliest grave marker with a death date is from 1807.Poucher, J. W. MD, Old Gravestones of Dutchess County, 1924 The cemetery is administered by Lyall Memorial Federated Church and is one of two still in use in the Village of Millbrook. Those graves closer to the meetinghouse are strictly those of member Friends from the early years of the meeting. As such they reflect Quaker aesthetics enough that that section of the cemetery is considered a contributing resource to the National Register listing. Later on, further away, burials were accepted from other faiths, introducing other funerary art customs. That portion of the cemetery is not considered contributing. History From the 1740s, Quakers had been settling in the area of Mechanic, today known as South Millbrook. They began meeting in each other's homes. There were enough that by 1744, the quarterly meeting at Purchase in Westchester County set up a new monthly meeting for Dutchess County, called the Oblong and Nine Partners Meeting, given the common names of their general locations.The Oblong is the area within a mile (1.6 km) of the New York-Connecticut border, claimed for a long time by both colonies' governments. \\"Nine Partners\\" came from the Great Nine Partners Patent, the land grant covering most of today's northwestern Dutchess County. It alternated its meetings each month between the Oblong house in Pawling and a log meeting house on the six acres (2.4 ha) where the present meeting house stands. It was replaced with a larger one in 1751 as the meeting grew. In 1767, the meeting began considering whether slavery was compatible with Christianity, one of the first instances of an American congregation taking up the question. In 1688 The Germantown Quakers (along with some of their Mennonite converts) had drafted an anti-slavery petition.1688 Germantown Quaker Petition Against Slavery The Oblong and Nine Partners meetings were separated two years later after they had both acquired enough members to justify separate organizations. They both decided that they could not accept slaveholders or any who profited from slavery as members or financial supporters, and continued to work to convince local slaveowners to free those they held. Through the Civil War, the Nine Partners Meeting and School was known to coordinate the Underground Railroad activities in Dutchess and Columbia counties. The log meeting house was replaced with a larger one was destroyed by fire on December 27, 1778. A committee was established in April of the following year to build a more permanent structure, measuring approximately . It was designed collectively by the meeting members. The large brick meeting house was built in 1780 at more than twice its originally budgeted cost, possibly due to the members' inexperience in bricklaying. The bricks were made a short distance directly south of the building on a farm known as Altamont Stock Farm which was the property of H. Howard Davison. Retrieved November 3, 2009 The choice of brick was an unusual one for a Quaker meeting house, reflecting the greater prosperity of the meeting members and their location in a less remote area, along the Dutchess Turnpike that is today the route of US 44. Quakers from other meetings who visited found the Nine Partners' Friends and their meetinghouse somewhat worldly. The success of the Nine Partners meeting helped the Society grow in the Hudson Valley. Several other meetings in the county were started within it as preparative meetings, and outside the county it led to the establishment of the Cornwall meeting in Orange County, still active today, along with meetings as far away as what is now Canada. It soon became a quarterly meeting.

Retrieved November 3, 2009 In 1796, the Nine Partners Meeting purchased the store and converted it to the Nine Partners Boarding School. The school enrolled up to one hundred students at a time and stayed in service until 1863, when the students transferred to the Oakwood Friends School (then known Oakwood Seminary at Union Springs,) in Poughkeepsie. Among its alumni were Lucretia Mott and Daniel Anthony, father of Daniel and Susan B. Anthony. Within a few years of closing, the former school building and land was purchased by John D. Wing, a former student of the school. The school building was moved to the top of the hill and became a part of his estate house. In 1826, the Meeting split into Hicksite and Orthodox Quakers.The Hicksite branch retained use of the brick meeting house and cemetery, while the Orthodox Quakers retained the school and built their own smaller meeting house between the school and the brick meeting house. This structure remained in place until 1882, when it was removed to the Village of Millbrook. In 1897, the brick meeting house and cemetery were turned over to the Nine Partners Burial Ground Association, ending Quaker ownership of the site. The Nine Partners School would eventually change location and become what is now Oakwood Friends School The Nine Partners Monthly Meeting continues as a part of the New York Yearly Meeting. The meeting house is used during the summer months. During the winter, the meeting is held at the Lyall Memorial Federated Church in Millbrook.

It has two locations, a main location in Riverhead, and a satellite location in Greenport, west of the North Ferry to Shelter Island. Both facilities contain active model railroad displays and gift shops. Riverhead The Riverhead location of the museum is located in a former Nassau-Suffolk Lumber Company warehouse and showroom at 416 Griffing Avenue, east of the Riverhead LIRR station. It was used as a lumber yard as far back as 1885, (The Corwin & Vail Lumber Company), and from 1891 to 1969 contained a turntable, water tower, and pump house, (the Long Island Railroad - Riverhead Yard). The location contains numerous rare passenger and freight cars as well as locomotives in various stages of restoration, some of which are the last of their kind. It also has a 16\\" gauge Allan Herschell Park Train riding train from the LIRR Pavilion of the 1964 - 1965 World's Fair.

Larvae of the moth feed on a wide range of crops from cotton and macadamia nuts to Citrus species. The larvae have a less selective diet than the codling moth, which feeds primarily on temperate fruit crops. The moth is believed to have originated in Sub- Saharan Africa. Outside of Africa the false codling moth has had limited success in establishing itself; however, this insect has been detected in Europe and the United States.Stibick, J. (2006). New Pest Response Guidelines: False Codling Moth Thaumatoibia leucotreta. USDA-APHIS-PPQ-Emergency and Domestic Programs, Riverside, Maryland. From 1984 to 2008, there have been 1500 interceptions of the moth on 99 plant taxa at 34 ports of entry in the United States.Hoffman, K. October 16. (2008). False Codling Moth Pest Profile. California Department of Food and Agriculture. The false codling moth is adapted for warm climate survival. Temperatures below 10 degrees Celsius impede development and reduce survival rates. Below 1 degree Celsius, all stages of the life cycle are terminated resulting in death.Van Der Geest et al. (May 27, 2003). Pest Assessment: False Codling Moth, Cryptophlebia leucotreta. USDA-APHIS-PPQ-CPHST-PERAL/NCSU. The species is prone to alternate-year infestation severity. Under ideal conditions (warm and humid) up to five generations a year may be produced. Life cycle The false codling moth experiences four life stages; egg, larva, pupa and adult. Egg Female moths lay their eggs between 5:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. The eggs are deposited on the surface of the host fruit over irregular intervals throughout the female's life. Under ideal conditions (25 ¬∞C) a single moth can produce up to 800 eggs. Egg incubation is temperature dependent and the period from deposition to hatching ranges from 2 to 22 days. Higher temperatures correlate to quicker developmental rates. Eggs are ovoid in shape with a granulated surface. They have a cream to white color when first laid that changes to a reddish color as development progresses. Sizes vary around 0.77 mm in length, 0.60 mm in width, and 1 mm in diameter. Larva Once hatched from the eggs the larvae burrow a 1 mm diameter hole into the host fruit. A discoloration appears at the wound site. Once the larvae are inside the pulp they begin to feed. Young larvae feed on the outer portion while older specimens move further into the interior of the fruit. Only a few larvae may survive per fruit. This stage lasts from 12 to 67 days depending on weather conditions. Upon maturity the larvae exit the fruit and drop to the ground on silken threads. Initially, on emergence from the egg, the larvae are only 1 mm and spotted. By the time of emergence from the fruit the larva have grown to roughly 15 mm and have developed an orange and pink color. Pupa In the pupa stage the false codling moth larvae spin a cream colored cocoon in the soil. Metamorphosis then occurs. The length of this stage is both temperature and gender regulated. Warmer periods are conducive to a quick emergence, while cooler temperatures render the process to a slower rate. Male moths require between 13 and 47 days to reach maturity and females need between 11 and 39 days. Adult The final adult stage of the moth occurs when the winged insect emerges from its cocoon. The moths are inactive during the day and are only active during portions of the night, isolated to within several hundred meters of their birth. Males may live between 14 and 57 days, whereas females will live between 16 and 70 days. Adults have patterned 1.25 to 2 cm wings with a variation of colors: grey, brown, black, and orange brown. A female's hindwing is slightly larger than a male's. Impact The false codling moth presents a problem to the citrus industry. All stages of fruit development of citrus are susceptible to a false codling moth infestation. Eggs are laid on the surface of the fruit. After emerging from the egg the larvae burrow into the rind. In citruses such as the orange the skin around the point of penetration develops a brown discoloration. The bored hole itself will also show signs of stress, excreting a brown substance. Once the fruit has been penetrated it is no longer a marketable item, and once compromised, the incidence of disease and mold increases. The open cavity is a point of entry for other pests and pathogens. Often fruits afflicted early in development prematurely drop. A USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) figure estimates crop yield losses as high as 20 percent in some cases. The establishment of a false codling moth population results in increased pesticide usage. Management Prevention is the preferred practice when dealing with the false codling moth. Inspections of imported and exported goods prevent the spread of the moth. There are several means to deal with an infestation and new developments are on the cusp of implementation. A 1921 bulletin on the false codling moth produced by the South African government outlines measures on how to deal with an infestation. It discredits banding the trees with nets as an effective practice and promotes destroying all natural fruit trees near the orchard, collecting and destroying all fallen fruits, spraying arsenate of lead, and flooding the orchard during the winter months. Later, increased knowledge of the harmful effects of lead to humans ended the practice of spraying acetate of lead. One of the more common pesticides in use is benzyl-urea. However, in some locations the false codling moth has developed some resistance. Other tactics for managing the moth use the power of attraction. Mercury vapor light traps and pheromonal traps are used lure the adults where they can be captured. There have been incidences of quarantining a section of an infected orchard.Vreysen, M.J.B. Area-Wide Control of Insect Pests. From Research to Field Implementation. A team at Rhodes University in South Africa is in the process of developing a virus that attacks the false codling moth. The insect-pathogenic virus is known as Cryptophlebia leucotreta granulovirus (CLGV) and lives in the digestive tract of the moth. An infection results in a reduction in appetite and eventual death. The pathogen is also capable of mutations and will be able to withstand possible resistance the moths may develop to the virus.Hendry, D. (October 2002). / Natural Born Killers-Insect Viruses . Science In Africa. Areas of incidence The false codling moth is well established in Africa and is commonly spread by the transport of produce carrying the insect. The following locations are where the moth is known to occur; Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo Democratic Republic, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Israel, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritius, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe References External links * Species Profile - False Codling Moth (Thaumatotibia leucotreta), National Invasive Species Information Center, United States National Agricultural Library.

It belongs to the raised bog regions of northwest Germany, which cover the geest terrain formed during the ice age and which stretch from the Netherlands to the eastern border of Lower Saxony. The geest tract on the Hanoverian Moor Geest consists of a ground moraine plateau with a height of 50‚Äì85 m above sea level that is dominated by bog. Its natural boundaries are the Aller glacial valley to the north and the Burgdorf-Peine Geest to the east. This geest terrain, with its small villages, has a distinctly rural character. The exception is the town of Neustadt am R√ºbenberge. Within the region's borders lies the Steinhuder Meer, a lake in area, in a shallow basin. Originally this inland water was three times the size as can be seen from its boggy fringes to the west and southwest. Much of the rest of the area used to consist of raised bogs. These were, however, frequently harvested for peat and cultivated for agricultural purposes. Most of the bogs that have been preserved have been much reduced in size, such as the Altwarmb√ºchen Moor, the Bissendorf Moor, the Helstorf Moor, the Schwarzes Moor, the Totes Moor and the Otternhagen Moor. Peat-cutting has resulted in artificial arable fields that have a boggy character. This makes their agricultural use quite limited. The forests consist mainly of pine trees used by the forestry industry. Deciduous woods occur occasionally on the end moraines. The depressions are extensively used by farmers for grassland. Whilst most of the bogs are under conservation protection today, the Totes Moor near Neustadt will still be used to harvest industrial peat on a large scale until about 2019. The region of Hanover is running the Hannoverian Moor Geest Nature Conservation Project from 2006-2016 which aims to permanently protect the four bogs in the Moor Geest region.

His best known work, the collection Practical Sermons on Several Important Subjects, published under the pseudonym Theophilus St. John, went through four editions (1803, 1804, 1808, 1812). Life Samuel Clapham was born in Leeds on 27 February 1755 to parents John and Elizabeth Clapham (n√©e Rook). He was the 3rd of 4 children (John, Betty, Samuel and William). He graduated B.A. from Clare Hall, Cambridge in 1778, taking the M.A. in 1784. During the course of his studies he was ordained deacon at London on 21 September 1777, and ordained priest at York on 6 October 1782. He became curate of Yarm, Yorkshire, in 1790, vicar of Great Ouseburn, Yorkshire, in 1797, and of Christchurch, then in Hampshire, in 1802, and rector of Gussage St Michael, Dorsetshire, in 1806. In the course of his clerical career, Clapham published several sermons. One of these, How far Methodism conduces to the interests of Christianity, and the welfare of society: impartially considered (1794), elicited the response Methodism vindicated from the charge of ignorance and enthusiasm, a reply to a sermon preached by S. Clapham, published at Margate in 1795. Clapham also served as a county magistrate in Hampshire for twenty-five years. One of his works, Collection of the Several Points of Sessions' Law (1818), was a digest of material relating to the powers and responsibilities of a justice of quarter sessions. The work drew particularly critical notice as an amateur compendium which, among other mistakes, stated that no case could be brought for verbal slander against a woman.The Monthly Review 88 (1819), pp. 332-333. In later life, Clapham retired to Sidmouth for his health, and he died there on 1 June 1830. He was survived by his three daughters. His only son, James Murray Clapham, had died on HMS Pandora on 28 April 1809, aged 18.

Vflo uses radar rainfall data for hydrologic input to simulate distributed runoff.Vieux, B.E., 2004, Distributed Hydrologic Modeling Using GIS, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands, 289 pp.Bedient, P.B., W.C. Huber, and B.E. Vieux, 2008, Hydrology and Floodplain Analysis, Fourth Edition, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 795 pp. Vflo employs GIS maps for parameterization via a desktop interface.Vieux, B.E., Z. Cui, and A. Gaur, 2004, Evaluation of a physics- based distributed hydrologic model for flood forecasting. J. Hydrol., 298(1-4): 155-177. DMIP special issue. The model is suited for distributed hydrologic forecasting in post-analysis and in continuous operations. Vflo output is in the form of hydrographs at selected drainage network grids, as well as distributed runoff maps covering the watershed. Model applications include civil infrastructure operations and maintenance, stormwater prediction and emergency management, continuous and short-term surface water runoff, recharge estimation, soil moisture monitoring, land use planning, water quality monitoring, and water resources management.  History  Vflo considers the spatial character of the parameters and precipitation controlling hydrologic processes, and thus improves upon lumped representations previously used in hydrologic modeling. Historical practice has been to use lumped representations because of computational limitations or because sufficient data was not available to populate a distributed model database.Desconnets, J.-C., B.E. Vieux, B. Cappelaere, and F. Delclaux (1996), ‚ÄúA GIS for hydrologic modeling in the semi-arid, HAPEX-Sahel experiment area of Niger Africa.‚Äù Trans. in GIS, 1(2): 82-94. Advances in computational speed; development of high-resolution precipitation data from radar and satellites; and availability of worldwide digital data sets and GIS technology makes distributed, physics-based modeling possible.ASCE, 1999, GIS Modules and Distributed Models of the Watershed, Report, ASCE Task Committee, GIS Modules and Distributed Models of the Watershed, P.A. DeBarry, R.G. Quimpo, eds., American Society of Civil Engineers, Reston, VA., p. 120. Vflo is designed to take advantage of the spatial variability of high resolution radar rainfall input, GIS datasets, and hydraulic channel characteristics. Because it is physics-based, it produces hydrographs based on conservation equations and the hydraulics of the drainage network, and can be employed in locations where there are no rain gauges or previous modeling studies. In addition, Vflo‚Äôs network approach makes models scalable from upland watersheds to river basins using the same drainage network.  Formulation  Vflo is suited for distributed hydrologic forecasting in post-analysis and continuous operations. Vflo models may be calibrated by loading precipitation maps for historical events and comparing simulated volume/peak hydrographs to observed hydrographs. Elevation data are taken from a digital elevation model. A vector channel representation is employed. Parameterization utilizes digital data sets at any resolution, including LIDAR terrain data and other digital maps of impervious area, soils, and land use/cover. Vflo is developed to utilize multi-sensor inputs from radar, satellites, rain gauges, or model forecasts. The kinematic wave analogy is used to represent hydraulic conditions in a watershed.

He is known for his paintings depicting cows (and occasionally sheep) in summer environments. Craig's landscapes often featured meadows and streams. The animals in his earlier paintings did not take up a large part of the canvas compared to the surrounding landscapes; in his later paintings, however, the animals were drawn larger and became more important than the landscapes around them. Career Craig lived in Philadelphia until he was forty. He studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, but taught himself how to paint. Some of Craig's work was on display at the school in 1869 and from 1876 to 1891. The paintings were also exhibited at the New York National Academy of Design in 1879 and 1881, and between 1884 and 1924. Craig gained a membership at the National Academy of Design in 1887 and moved to New York City in 1899. He lived there for ten years, after which he moved to Rutherford, New Jersey. Between 1875 and 1900, Craig's paintings were being exhibited in places such as the Cincinnati Industrial Exposition, the Brooklyn Art Association, and the Brooklyn Art Club. Craig's paintings have also been displayed at the Butler Institute of American Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Newark Museum, the Washington County Museum of Fine Arts, the Mobile Museum of Art, and the World's Columbian Exhibition in Chicago.

The description \\"Australian\\" is given because the test was devised in Adelaide, South Australia, and to distinguish it from other nations' instruments (such as the Icelandic Sheep-Goat Scale). A person who believes in some aspect of the paranormal is termed a \\"sheep\\", and a disbeliever a \\"goat\\" (after the New Testament simile about Christ separating the [nations (error)] /people (correction)/ as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats ). The version of the scale most commonly used in research (Thalbourne, 1995) has 18 items, such as \\"I believe in the existence of ESP\\", \\"I have had at least one dream that came true and which (I believe) was not just a coincidence\\", \\"I believe in life after death\\" and \\"I believe in the existence of psychokinesis (or PK)‚Äîthat is, the direct influence of mind on a physical system, without the mediation of any known physical energy\\". The possible answers are \\"true\\", \\"uncertain\\" and \\"false\\", which score two points, one point and zero points, respectively. The sum of the points given to the 18 items is the total ASGS score, which ranges from 0 through 36. The criterion for item selection is whether the topic contravenes philosopher C. D. Broad's \\"Basic Limiting Principles\\", which set limits on the existence and operation of mind in a mathematically describable universe; the scale does not include items on astrology, cryptozoological creatures, or extraterrestrial intelligence, to name a few anomalies. While the above-described version of the scale--the Forced Choice version--is the most popular, there are alternative versions; the most-frequently found are the visual analogue scale version and the Rasch scaled version.

The journal covers biological, chemical, or physical mechanisms of broad physiological significance. The major emphasis is on physiological problems at the cellular and molecular level.Mission statement  Editorial history  The journal was established in 1918 by Jacques Loeb. Editing duties were shared with Winthrop Osterhout of Harvard University. The initial rationale for the journal was stated in this extract from the 1918 announcement of publication: > Under the pressure of demands of medicine and other professions, physiology > has developed in the direction of an applied science, with limited > opportunity for the investigation of purely theoretical problems. On the > other hand, the physico-chemical methods of analyzing life phenomena have > thus far made little inroad into the domain of zoology and botany. Under > these circumstances, it has happened that what might be regarded as the most > fundamental of all the biological sciences, namely general physiology, has > not come to have a journal of its own. It is this condition which the > establishment of The Journal of General Physiology is intended to correct. Following the death of Loeb in 1924, the editorship was passed to Osterhout, who moved to the Rockefeller Institute shortly thereafter. He was joined by William Crozier of Harvard and John Howard Northrop of Rockefeller, who served as fellow editors. For the next 20-plus years, this trio read and evaluated all submissions. They were joined in 1946 by Wallace Fenn and in 1950 by Alfred Mirsky and Lawrence Blinks. In the mid-1950s, Detlev Bronk and Frank Brink Jr. also became editors. This practice of editorial review and evaluation continued into the mid-1950s. However, with Mirsky acting as a de facto editor in chief (and formally appointed as such in 1960), the practice of peer review using outside reviewers took hold. In 1960 associate editors were added. Mirsky was succeeded by Clarence Connolly, who served from 1961 to 1964. Prior to Connolly, it was common practice for editors to publish in the journal, as evidenced by Osterhout, Crozier, and Northrop each publishing over 100 articles (the time frame of Northrup‚Äôs publications‚Äîthe first in 1919, the last in 1968‚Äîbears out his longevity). Connolly was the first editor to not publish in the journal and subsequent editors have published infrequently. When an editor or associate editor does submit an article, the review process is handled by an outside guest editor, usually a member of the editorial board. From 1964 to 1966, J. Woodland Hasting of Harvard University served as editor in chief. In 1966, the Rockefeller University recruited Paul Cranefield to establish a laboratory of cardiac physiology, and he became editor in chief. Under Cranefield, the journal began to be published on a monthly basis (it had been a bimonthly publication since its inception). Beginning in 1968 and continuing until 1984, Cranefield acted as the sole editor; though with the support of honorary editors and an editorial board. In 1984 Cranefield recruited several associate editors. At this time, the practice of weekly editorial meetings became standard, with discussion of reviews and consensus of the editors being the modus operandi that continues to the present day (though the meetings now partially occur in cyberspace).https://rupress.org/jgp/article/125/1/3/44193/A-Brief-History-of- The-Journal-of-General In 1995, Andersen succeeded Cranefield as editor in chief. In 2008, Andersen was succeeded by Edward Pugh Jr and then by Sharona Gordon in 2014. The current editor in chief, David Eisner, assumed the role in January 2020. Over the past several years, the journal has instituted a series of Perspectives. The purpose of the Perspectives is to provide a forum in which scientific uncertainties or controversies can be discussed in an authoritative yet open manner. To frame the issue, two or more experts are invited to present brief points of view on the problem, which are published back-to-back in the journal. The Perspectives are accompanied by a short introductory editorial that introduces the problem and also invites the submission of comments in the form of Letters to the Editor.JGP Perspectives https://rupress.org/jgp/search- results?page=1&q;=*&fl;_SiteID=1000005&exPrm;_fq=TocCategories:%22perspective%22 While the journal is still printed as a monthly publication, articles are posted online daily.https://rupress.org/jgp/pages/ifora  References   External links  * * Volumes 1‚Äì4 of the journal at the Biodiversity Heritage Library Category:Physiology journals Category:Publications established in 1918 Category:English-language journals Category:Monthly journals Category:Rockefeller University Press academic journals ","title":"The Journal of General Physiology"},{"id":"24938111","text":"The co-op in the 2000s The Capitol Hill Babysitting Cooperative (CHBC) is a cooperative located in Washington, D.C., whose purpose is to fairly distribute the responsibility of babysitting between its members. The co-op is often used as an allegory for a demand-oriented model of an economy. The allegory illustrates several economic concepts, including the paradox of thrift and the importance of the money supply to an economy's well being. The allegory has received continuing attention, particularly in the wake of the late-2000s recession. Former members Joan Sweeney and Richard James Sweeney first presented the co-op as an allegory for an economy in a 1977 article, but it was little known until popularized by Paul Krugman in his book Peddling Prosperity and subsequent writings. Krugman has described the allegory as \\"a favorite parable\\", and \\"life-changing\\".  History  The co-op was founded in the late 1950s, and continues to operate. In 2010, there were twenty families in the co-op (down from its heyday of 250 families). Some of these are second-generation members of the co-op. It is open to new members. Members naturally left the co-op as their children grew up, but many continued to work together in various organizations. In 2007 a number of the now elderly former co-op members from the 1960s and 1970s were involved in founding the Capitol Hill Village, an organization dedicated to helping elderly people continue living at home by providing a support community. The organization is modeled after Beacon Hill Village in Beacon Hill, Boston, and while it involves elements of mutualism, it is dues-paying and involves external parties. Some additional details: * The co-op grew from 20 families in the early 1960s to more than 200 in the early 1970s. * By the early 1970s the co-op was geographically split in two‚Äînorth/south or east/west. * In the 1960s the position of secretary rotated monthly. This was seen as an onerous task, which is why it was rotated, and entailed taking babysitting requests, matching sitters with requests (hence being on call at all times), and balancing the books. * Double time was paid after midnight and between 5 pm and 7 pm (during supper time). does not specify if double time was paid to sitters or to the secretary; states \\"time-and-a-half for later hours\\" for sitters. * Time-and-a- half was paid for later hours. * The currency issued by the co-op, called scrip, was in extremely high demand, at least at some points, with a former member being quoted as saying \\"Oh my God, you would kill for scrip. ... You would sell your children for scrip.\\" Cooperative system and history The co-op issued scrip, each piece was worth half an hour of babysitting time. The co-op gave each new member twenty hours' worth of \\"scrip,\\" and required them to return the same amount when they left the co-op.Some sources, such as , state that the money was paid back after one year, which appears to be a misunderstanding, as specifies that it was paid back when a family left. Members of the co-op used scrip to pay for babysitting. Each piece of scrip was contractually deemed to pay for half an hour of babysitting. To earn more scrip, couples babysat other member's children. Administrators in the co-op were responsible for various tasks, such as matching couples needing a babysitter with couples that wanted to babysit. To \\"pay\\" for the administrative costs of the system, each member had an obligation to contribute fourteen hours' worth of scrip a year (i.e. 28 scrip). Some of the administration's scrip went to administrators to be spent and some was simply saved. At first, new members of the co-op felt, on average, that they should save more scrip before they began spending. So they babysat whenever the opportunity arose, but did not spend the scrip they acquired. Since babysitting opportunities only arise when other couples want to go out, there was a shortage of demand for babysitting. As a result, the co-op fell into a \\"recession\\". This illustrates the phenomenon known as the paradox of thrift. The administration's initial reaction to the co-op's recession was to add new rules. But the measures did not resolve the inadequate demand for babysitting. Eventually, the co-op was able to alleviate the issue by giving new members thirty hours' worth of scrip, but only requiring them to return twenty when they left the co-op. Within a few years a new problem arose. There was too much scrip and a shortage of babysitting. As new members joined, more scrip was added to the system until couples had too much, but new members were not able to spend it because no one else wanted to babysit. In general, the cooperative experienced regular problems because the administration took in more than it spent, and at times the system added too much scrip into the system via the amount issued to new members. Hypothetical resolutions The co-op's problems occurred because of two issues: the scrip's value was fixed, and the ratio of scrip to couples was volatile. The cooperative could have made the ratio of scrip to couples fixed, by adjusting the amount of scrip entering the system via new members and leaving the system via couples choosing to leave the co-op. In addition, it could have let the scrip value adjust so that couples were paid more scrip to babysit when the supply of babysitters was small, and less when the supply was large. Mitchell criticizes the suggestion that price flexibility alone would resolve the demand problem. He notes that a fall in prices would reduce the price of babysitting. This, of course, also means that the amount of scrip received for babysitting would also be less. Thus, since parents made less money, even as the supply of babysitters decreased, because of less incentive to babysit, the babysitters would not become wealthier. The traditional neo-classical response to this criticism, given by Pigou, is that the effect of cheaper babysitting prices is rather a redistribution of wealth from couples with little scrip to those with more, which will encourage persons who have saved in the past to spend more. Mitchell criticizes this because, he asserts, the falling wages of babysitters only solves the problem if it reduces the desire of couples to save, which is not supported by any research. The only effect of falling wages would be to increase the real value of nominal contracts. In other words, couples would have to spend more time babysitting before they acquired the amount necessary to leave the cooperative. Mitchell concludes that the problem is greater aggregate desire to save than can be funded by existing administrative debt, and that the solution is thus either to reduce (desire for) savings or, more likely increase spending by simply issuing more scrip. Allegory for a liquidity trap A modification to the co-op allegory creates a situation resembling a liquidity trap. Suppose that the co-op developed a system where parents were able to borrow scrip from the administration in emergencies and pay it back with interest later. This lending program would be advantageous to both the administration and parents. It gives the administration more tools to control demand for babysitting. If the administration observes that demand for babysitting is up, it can increase the interest members must pay when they borrow scrip, which will most likely result in less member borrowing. Thus the demand for babysitting will be reduced. Similarly, the administration can decrease the amount of interest paid when demand for babysitting is low. And the system would help parents, because they would no longer have to save as much scrip because they could simply borrow more in the cases of an emergency. These hypothetical modification to the Capitol Hill Babysitting Co-op makes its administration analogous to a central bank. Depending upon the economic conditions, the efficacy of the general system (i.e. the co-op) is partially dependent on interest rates. When times are good, it is best to have relatively high interest rates, and when times are bad the rates should be lower. Imagine that during the winter couples do not want to go out, but want to acquire more scrip for the summer. To compensate, the administration can lower the amount of extra scrip returned when parents want to borrow in the winter, and increase rates in the summer. Depending upon the strength of the seasonality of babysitting, this might work. But suppose the seasonality is so strong that no one wants to go out in the winter even when the administration sets its interest rates to zero. That is, suppose no parents want to go out even when they can borrow money for free. In this hypothetical situation, the co-op has fallen into a liquidity trap. Hypothetical resolutions According to Krugman, the key problem is that the scrip's value is fixed. Couples know that each scrip they save in the winter can be redeemed for the same amount of time in the summer, giving them incentive to save because, psychologically speaking, each scrip's value is worth more to them in the summer than in the winter. Instead, if the co-op modified the system so that the scrip is redeemable for less time in the upcoming summer than in the winter, there would be less incentive to save because members would get less \\"bang for their buck\\" if they chose to hold onto the scrip until the summer. In other words, Krugman is suggesting that the co-op should have an inflationary monetary policy. The most common criticism of Krugman's interpretation, given by Austrian economics (see Austrian critiques) is that the problem is the fixed price of babysitting (wages), not of the scrip (money), alleging that the correct solution is to let couples decide how much they charge for babysitting on their own; when there is high demand or low supply of babysitters, couples would be more willing to babysit if they were given more scrip for their services. Alternatively, the Neo-Chartalist view asserts that the co-op's administration should resolve the co-op's issues via \\"fiscal\\" policy. That is, the scrip system is fiat money,Define fiat money to be money whose value is derived entirely from its official status as a means of exchange. Some alternative definitions also require that fiat money has no fixed value in terms of an objective standard. Under the latter definition the scrip is considered credit money. which can be created or destroyed at will by \\"spending\\" or \\"taxation\\", and the administration should simply inject more scrip into the system when demand is low, and reduce the amount of scrip when demand is high by increasing scrip fees or charging a levy (a \\"tax\\"). The co- op board's deficit spending (e.g. spending/issuing thirty, taxing twenty) is properly called fiscal policy, and should not be confused with monetary policy, which refers to central bank lending. From the Chartalist perspective, the key point is the co-op board's deficits give co-op members additional scrip. This is because the co-op is a closed economy; assuming that there is a fixed amount of scrip, total savings is zero, so S_g+S_m=0 where S_g is the administration's savings and S_m is aggregate member savings. In other words, S_m=-S_g. Thus, as the administration's savings become negative S_m goes up. Initially when the administration spent twenty hours' worth of scrip and taxed twenty, there was no administrative debt (i.e. S_g=0), which implies S_m=0. The deficit spending created government debt of ten hours per family. Since every piece of scrip spent by the administration is given to the members, the result is that couples were given an additional ten hours of scrip (i.e. S_m=-S_g=-[‚Äì10√ó(number of members)]=10√ó(number of members)), which may fulfill the private sector's desired savings quota. The emphasis on the net scrip of co-op members, which equal the amount injected into the co-op by the administration, is the distinguishing feature of the Chartalist view. From this perspective, the function of introducing lending, as Krugman suggests, is that interest on this lending creates or destroys net member savings. For example, if the administration lends ten hours' worth of scrip at 10% interest for one year (thus collecting eleven hours' worth of scrip in one year's time), then it has created ten hours' worth of scrip but will withdraw eleven hours in the future, thus reducing net private sector assets by one hour. As a consequence of this difference, while Krugman suggests using monetary policy to manage the economy, and resolving a liquidity trap by creating inflationary expectations to make saving less desirable, Miller suggests using fiscal policy to manage the economy (matching administrative debt to desired private savings), and resolving a liquidity trap by issuing more scrip, hence increasing the administrative debt, to fund this desired saving. Another proposed solution is to put a maturity date upon the scrip, so that it must be spent, and people can borrow scrip through scrip \\"bonds\\".

Designed in the mid-1930s, the type persevered until 1945. In Spain, variants of the design saw service until 1973.  Second Sino-Japanese War  The Chinese He 111A The first bomber version of the Heinkel He 111 to enter production was the He 111A-0, with a pre-production batch of 10 aircraft being ordered for service evaluation late in 1935. Performance of these aircraft, powered by two BMW VI engines, was disappointing, and the aircraft were rejected by the Luftwaffe. The government of the Chinese state of Canton was less picky, however, and purchased six He 111A-0s, (also known as He 111Ks), taking delivery in mid-1936, the aircraft entering service with the Nationalist Chinese Air Force (which had taken over the Cantonese air force) in October‚ÄìNovember 1936.Air International August 1987, p. 80.Andersson 2008, p. 270. Chinese use of the He 111 in the Second Sino-Japanese War that began on 7 July 1937 with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident was limited, operational use being at first delayed by a lack of suitable bombs.Andersson 2008, p. 131. On the Chinese Heinkels first operational mission, a raid by five He 111s and six Martin 139 against Japanese forces near Shanghai, the inexperienced crews left the retractable ventral \\"dustbin\\" turrets extended, so the Heinkels could not keep up with the Martin bombers and their escorting fighters, and three of the five aircraft were shot down by Japanese fighters. One He 111 was taken out of storage in December 1943, fitted with Wright Cyclone radial engines and converted to a transport aircraft. Spanish Civil War The initial bomber force of the Condor Legion, the German volunteer force supporting Franco's Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War, was composed of Junkers Ju 52/3m bomber/transport aircraft. These proved vulnerable to Soviet supplied Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 fighters, with the Germans suffering heavy losses, and on 6 January 1937 it was decided to send some of Germany's latest bombers to Spain, both to allow evaluation of the new aircraft in operational conditions and to allow effective use against the Republicans. Four He 111Bs, together with four Dornier Do 17s and four Junkers Ju 86s arrived in Spain in February 1937, equipping a Staffel of Kampfgruppe 88.Hooton 1994, pp. 125‚Äì128.Air International August 1987, p. 81. The Heinkels made their combat debut on 9 March 1937, when they attacked Republican held airfields in support of the Battle of Guadalajara.Hooton 1994, p. 128. The Heinkel proved superior to the two other German medium bombers, being both faster and carrying a heavier bombload. Initial losses in combat were low, and more deliveries from Germany allowed full re-equipment of Kampfgruppe 88 with the Heinkel by October 1937.Air International September 1987, p. 128. Further deliveries of the improved He 111E allowed some of the older He 111Bs to be passed to the Spanish Nationalists, who formed Grupo 10-G-25 in August 1938. In total, 94 Heinkels were delivered to the Condor Legion during the war. By the time the Spanish Civil War ended on 1 April 1939, 21 Heinkels had been lost to enemy action, with a further 15 lost in accidents and one destroyed by sabotage. The 58 remaining Heinkels were left behind and formed the backbone of the bombing force of the new Spanish State.Air International September 1987, pp. 129‚Äì130, 132. The 25 He 111B and 33 He 111Es were supplemented late in 1939 with three He 111Js, which were used to fly weather reconnaissance flights, with three H models later being received from Germany for the same role, and a fourth aircraft received as a pattern aircraft for planned licence production.Cruz Air Enthusiast September/October 1998, p. 32. As World War II intensified in Europe, the Spanish Air Force suffered from fuel shortages, while the supply of spare parts for the He 111E's Jumo engines dried up, which resulted in most of the He 111Es being grounded from February 1942, placing a greater burden on the underpowered He 111Bs. The problems with the Jumo engines were solved by February 1946, however, allowing the He 111Es to return to regular service.Cruz Air Enthusiast September/October 1998, p. 33. While CASA 2.111s (licence-built He 111H-16s) started to enter service in early 1950, the German-built aircraft continued in use as bombers, as the CASA-built aircraft's Jumo 211F engines (which had been found in a depot in France in 1949Cruz Air Enthusiast November/December 2000, p. 50.) proved to be unreliable.The He 111Bs were phased out by 1952, with the He 111Es remaining in use as a bomber until 1956.Cruz Air Enthusiast September/October 1998, p. 34. Another use for the elderly Heinkels was as a multi-engined trainer, with the last two German-built Heinkels, a He 111E and a He 111H remaining in use until 1958, with the final flight carried out at the Multi-engined Aircraft School at Jerez de la Frontera on 28 November 1958.Cruz Air Enthusiast September/October 1998, pp. 34‚Äì35. Five CASA 2.111 bombers (Spanish-built variants of the Heinkel He-111), bombed enemy positions, while an equal number of CASA 352 transports (Spanish-built versions of the Junkers Ju 52/3m) dropped a force of 75 paratroopers into the outpost. Second World War Invasion of Poland and the Phoney war Five He 111 Geschwader were committed to the German invasion of Poland. Kampfgeschwader 1 (KG 1), Kampfgeschwader 4 (KG 4), Kampfgeschwader 26 (KG 26), Kampfgeschwader 27 (KG 27) and Kampfgeschwader 53 (KG 53). All, with the exception of KG 4 were committed to Luftflotte 1 under the command of Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring. operated under Luftflotte 4.Mackay 2003, p. 36. The He 111 provided medium-high altitude interdiction and ground support missions for the German Army. The He 111 participated in the Battle of the Bzura when the Polish Army Pozna≈Ñ and Army Pomorze were virtually destroyed by aerial assault.Mackay 2003, p. 42. It also participated extensively in the Siege of Warsaw. During the campaign the Luftwaffe had anticipated that its bombers would be able to defend themselves adequately. PZL P.11s \\"for all their limited firepower and aerodynamic limitations, were capable of handing out severe punishment when able to engage the bombers without interference\\".Mackay 2003, p. 39. During the period of the phoney war the He 111 was tasked with strategic bombing attacks over the North Sea and naval bases in the United Kingdom as a means of attacking the Royal Navy. On 9 November 1939, Adolf Hitler issued directive No. 9 which emphasised the target with most importance as the British Navy. Mindful of the damaging blockade that hurt the German war effort in the First World War, the directive selected British port storage depots with particular reference to oil and grain facilities, mining British sea lanes and direct attacks on British merchant shipping.Mackay 2003, p. 44. In October 1939 several sorties had been made to bomb the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow and the Firth of Forth. HMS Hood was a particular target.Mackay 2003, p. 44. Interceptions were made by RAF Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane squadrons and suffered the odd losses.Mackay 2003, pp. 44-48. One significant incident took place on 22 February 1940. Kampfgeschwader 26 were ordered to attack fishing boats in the Dogger Bank region. The Kriegsmarine suspected they were being used as early warning vessels to report German warship movements in the North Sea, who at this time had made sorties to sink Allied merchant shipping. At the same time a German naval flotilla 1. Zerst√∂rerflottille was sent into the area to disrupt Allied shipping.Mackay 2003, pp. 48-49. Lying between the German ships and the open sea was a massive minefield to prevent the Royal Navy from reaching the Heligoland Bight. Within the field lay a 6-mile (10-km) gap for the Germans to slip through.Mackay 2003, pp. 48-49. The liaison between the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe broke down. had not been told of the German destroyers' presence. Attacking from the He 111s sank the Leberecht Maas and the Max Schultz, with the loss of 600 German sailors.Mackay 2003, pp. 48-49. Invasion of Norway The Heinkel formed the backbone of the Kampfwaffe in Operation Weser√ºbung, the invasions of Denmark and Norway. , KG26 and KGr 100 were committed. The occupation of Denmark took less than 24 hours with minimal casualties and no aerial losses. The He 111s first task along with the Luftwaffe in general was to offset British Naval superiority in the North Sea. He 111s of KG 26 were to support the German Naval Task Force, composed of the heavy cruisers and L√ºtzow, light cruiser , three E-Boats and eight minesweepers with 2,000 men to Oslo. were unable to prevent the sinking of Bl√ºcher at the Battle of Dr√∏bak Sound by the Oscarsborg Fortress. focused on Dr√∏bak since the other strong points were taken. Showered with SC 250 250 kg (550 lb) bombs, the Norwegians capitulated.Mackay 2003, p. 50. Heinkel He 111s of KG 26 helped Junkers Ju 88s of KG 30 damage the battleship and sink the destroyer on 9 April.Hooton 2007, p. 34. With most of the country secure the He 111s participated in the Battles of Narvik and anti-shipping missions against Allied reinforcements being brought to Norway by sea in May‚ÄìJune 1940. Invasion of France and the Low Countries The French Campaign opened on 10 May 1940. The He 111 Geschwader encountered scattered and uncoordinated Allied fighter resistance over the Netherlands and Belgium. On 14 May 1940, He 111s of KG 54 undertook the Rotterdam Blitz in which large portions of the city were destroyed after the 111s had dropped some 91 tonnes (100 tons) of bombs. The Dutch surrendered early the following morning, ending the Battle of the Netherlands.Mackay 2003, p. 53. Most units suffered light to moderate losses in the early stages. The exception was KG 27, which suffered the heaviest losses of the He 111 Geschwader over the French sectors. By the end of the first day, seven He 111s were missing, two were written off and five damaged.Mackay 2003, pp. 56-57. The He 111s supported the dash to the English Channel and helped defeat the French forces at Sedan, the Allied counter-offensive at the Battle of Arras and assisted German siege forces during the Battle of Dunkirk. During the Sedan breakthrough, 3,940 sorties were flown against French positions by German bomber formations, the bulk of which were equipped with the He 111. The result was a French collapse that made the pincer move of Fall Gelb possible.Hooton Vol 1 2007, p. 65. The He 111 - with its heavier bomb load - was also tasked with the destruction of the French rail network in the Reims and Amiens regions. Their attacks were instrumental in preventing French reinforcements and retreats. Any French counter against the German forces left flank was impossible as a result.Mackay 2003, pp. 60-63. With the conclusion of Fall Gelb the He 111 units prepared for Fall Rot. Some 600 He 111s and Do 17s took part in Operation Paula which was aimed at the final destruction of French air power in and around Paris. The resulting combats and bombing failed to destroy what remained of the Arm√©e de l'Air.Hooton 2007, pp. 83-84. From that point He 111 losses were light, with occasional exceptions.Mackay 2003, pp. 62-64. The He 111 had performed well, though losses were substantially higher than in any campaign before it. This was mainly due to its light defensive armament. This would be exposed during the Battle of Britain, the first major test of the He 111s poor defensive armament.Mackay 2003, p. 60. Battle of Britain Heinkel He 111 bomber over Wapping and the Isle of Dogs in the East End of London on 7 September 1940 Luftflotte 2 and Luftflotte 3 committed 34 Gruppen to the campaign over Britain. Fifteen of them were equipped with the He 111. The remainder were mixed Do 17 and Ju 88 units.Mackay 2003, pp. 66-67. The He 111 and Ju 88 were equal in performance in all but speed, in which the Ju 88 was faster. The Do 17 was also faster, but lacked the heavy bomb load capabilities of the Ju 88 and He 111. During the Battle of Britain the Heinkels ability to take heavy punishment was one of its strengths and it suffered fewer losses than the Ju 88. The battle highlighted the need for heavier defensive armament and effective fighter protection by the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 units if losses were to be kept to sustainable levels. The concentration of most of the crew in the glass nose made the He 111 vulnerable to concentrated fire from a head-on attack.Mackay 2003, pp. 69-70. A frontal shot of a He 111H, summer 1940. The cockpit design gave the crew excellent vision but was vulnerable to attack from a head-on position The advantages won in July and August were lost by the switch of strategy to bombing British cities and industrial centres, known as the Blitz) on 7 September 1940. The He 111 was now being asked to perform in the role of the strategic bomber. Despite the fact that it lacked the load-carrying capacity of later heavy bombers, the He 111 still carried enough destructive power to cause severe damage to strategic targets; the de Havilland Mosquito factory near Bristol was devastated by Kampfgeschwader 53 on 30 August. A month later, the Woolston Supermarine Spitfire factory was destroyed largely by He 111s of Kampfgeschwader 55 on 26 September, forcing the factory's closure and dispersal, though the disruption to production was, at that time, not as serious as it would have been in July/August 1940.Mackay 2003, p. 85. He 111s were fitted with the Knickebein and used it for blind- bombing during the Blitz, leading to the Battle of the Beams. This system, fitted to all German bombers, enabled the He 111 to bomb targets during the night without visual contact. Some special Pfadfinder (Pathfinder) units such as Kampgruppe 100 were equipped with the X-Ger√§t blind-bombing system and were used to illuminate targets with incendiary bombs for the regular bomber units that followed. Theoretically, it could hit individual buildings, though in practice jamming and other factors tended to decrease its accuracy. Eventually, the Y-Ger√§t was introduced, as an enhanced version of the previous X-system.Mackay 2003, p. 90. On 3 November 1940 the RAF had a chance to evaluate a He 111 that had landed along the coast and was partially submerged with the equipment. A Royal Navy captain who arrived claimed command of the salvage operation as he was a superior rank to the attending Army Officer and insisted the He 111 be towed to deeper water before hoisting it up. The ropes snapped and the He 111 sank. Though the machine was eventually pulled out, the salt water had got into its Ger√§t system. The Luftwaffe tried to attack industrial, transport and civilian targets simultaneously but failed to do so. Even so, the He 111 contributed to the Birmingham Blitz, Bristol Blitz, Barrow Blitz, Coventry Blitz, Liverpool Blitz, Plymouth Blitz and Southampton Blitz which caused severe damage. Some of these targets were obscured by cloud, but the equipped X-Ger√§t Heinkels inflicted heavy damage. However the British countered its use with decoy sites to attract the attention of bombers and the \\"Meacon\\" system, which disrupted Luftwaffe beacon transmissions.Mackay 2003, p. 90. 242 He 111s were destroyed during the course of the battle between July and October 1940, a total substantially lower than the 303 Ju 88s destroyed. The Dornier Do 17s losses in the Battle of Britain amounted to 132 machines destroyed, the lowest losses of the three German bomber types.Aircraft Strength and Losses. Source used: \\"The Battle of Britain\\" by Peter G. Cooksley, Ian Allan Ltd, 1990 Invasion of the Balkans The campaign against Yugoslavia and Greece lasted only three weeks, but the He 111 played a key role in it. On 6 April 1941 He 111s attached to Luftflotte 4 participated in the Bombing of Belgrade. After the brief advance and conquest of Greece the He 111 also supported Axis forces in the Battle of Crete, sustaining light losses. During this period it also participated in the Siege of Malta and conducted bombing raids against Egypt and the Suez Canal.Mackay 2003, p. 119-120. Kampfgeschwader 4 delivered the lion's share of the raids in May‚ÄìJune 1941 against coastal targets including Alexandria and suffered the loss of six aircraft and five crews.Mackay 2003, p. 121. Torpedo bomber operations He 111H on a torpedo training exercise, 10 October 1941 The He 111 also served as a torpedo bomber in the Battle of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. In the Atlantic campaign the Luftwaffe created Fliegerf√ºhrer Atlantik for this purpose. In the spring 1941, the Luftwaffe had been using conventional bombs to attack shipping more often than not. Such a method resulted in heavy losses to He 111 units in aircraft and crew as the 111s attack point was too close. III./Kampfgeschwader 40 had only eight of 32 crews remaining by April 1941 and had to be withdrawn. Most He 111 units were replaced by the faster Junkers Ju 88 and Dornier Do 217 which also suffered losses, but not to the extent of the He 111.National Archives 2000, p. 108. A proper aerial torpedo could have prevented such losses. The German Navy had purchased Horton naval torpedo patents from Norway in 1933 and the Whitehead Fiume patent from Italy in 1938. But air-launched torpedo development was slow. In 1939 trials with Heinkel He 59 and Heinkel He 115 had revealed a 49 percent failure rate owing to aerodynamic difficulties and depth control and fusing difficulties. Until 1941 the Luftwaffe obtained poor results in this field.National Archives 2000, p. 109. When in 1941 the Luftwaffe took an active interest, the Kriegsmarine resisted Luftwaffe involvement and collaboration and direct requests by the Luftwaffe to take over development was refused. With the Atlantic campaign in full swing, the Luftwaffe needed a torpedo bomber to allow its aircraft to avoid increased shipboard anti-aircraft armament. It set up a number of schools devoted to torpedo attack at Gossenbrode, Germany and Athens, Greece. It was found that the He 111 was highly suited to such operations. In December 1941 the Luftwaffe was granted the lead in torpedo development. Trials at Grossenbrode enabled the He 111 to carry two torpedoes, while the Ju 88 could also manage the same number and remain faster in flight. was equipped with both the He 111 and Ju 88. Some 42 He 111s served with I./KG 26 flying out of Norway.National Archives 2000, p. 112. The He 111's ordnance was the Italian Whitehead Fiume 850 kg (1,870 lb) torpedo and the German F5 50 kg (110 lb) light torpedo. Both functioned over a distance of at a speed of The Whitedhead armament weighed over 200 kg (440 lb).Mackay 2003, p. 131. To make an attack the He 111 pilot had to drop to and reduce air speed to . The water depth had to a minimum of .Mackay 2003, p. 131. In comparison to the Italian and German- designed ordnance, the Imperial Japanese Navy's Type 91 torpedo ‚Äî the 838 kg- weight (1,848 lb) air-deployed ordnance which had proved so devastating to the U.S. Navy's warships during the Attack on Pearl Harbor ‚Äî which, in its Revision 2 version, would end up being considered for German production as the Luftorpedo LT 850, after its plans were taken to Germany nine months later by IJN submarine I-30 on August 2, 1942. The He 111 was committed to operations in the Arctic Ocean against the Arctic convoys traveling to the Soviet Union from North America and the United Kingdom. One notable action involved I./KG 26 attacking Convoy PQ 17 in June 1942. I./KG 26 and its He 111s sank three ships and damaged three more. Later, III./KG 26 helped Ju 88s of III./KG 30 based at Banak sink several more ships. Some 25 out of 35 merchant ships were sunk altogether.Mackay 2003, p. 133. Convoy PQ 16 was also successfully intercepted by KG 26, who claimed four vessels, but lost six crews in return.Mackay 2003, p. 134. Convoy PQ 18 was also intercepted during 13 15 September 1942. In total some 13 out of 40 ships were sunk. However it cost the Luftwaffe 40 aircraft, of which 20 were KG 26 He 111s.Mackay 2003, p. 134. Of the 20 crews, 14 were missing.Mackay 2003, p. 134. He 111 torpedo units continued to operate with success elsewhere. Anti-shipping operations in the Black Sea against the Soviet Navy were also carried out. The Soviets mainly sailed at night and singly, making interception very difficult.Mackay 2003, p. 134. The Soviets also heavily protected their shipping at sea and in port. Anti-aircraft defensive fire was severe in daylight and at night was supported by searchlights, though these measures did not stop the He 111 completely. Geschwader continued to press home their attacks with some success.Mackay 2003, pp. 136-137. On the morning of 7 November 1941, an He 111 of KG 28 sank the Soviet hospital ship Armenia off the coast of Crimea, killing at least 5,000 people. In the Mediterranean theatre the Allies had won air superiority by 1943 but the torpedo Geschwader, KG 26, continued to operate He 111s in shipping attack units. The He 111s attacked Allied shipping along the African coast flying from bases in Sicily and Sardinia both in daylight and darkness. In spite of nightfighers and anti-aircraft defences the He 111s continued to get through to their targets. Losses meant a gradual decline in experienced crews and standards of attack methods. Such missions were largely abandoned in the spring owing to shortages in aircraft and crews. By April, KG 26 could only scrape together some 13 Ju 88 and He 111 torpedo bombers.Mackay 2003, pp. 137-138. With the exception of I./KG 26 all other groups converted onto the Ju 88.Mackay 2003, p. 138.

The record of the He 111 fleet at the time of its departure between the 15 and 29 May indicated it had participated in seven armed reconnaissance flights and five bombing missions against Habbaniya which involved 20 crews and the dropping of 10 tons of bombs.Mackay 2003, p. 123. The Italian failures during the initial period of the North African Campaign forced the Wehrmacht to reinforce the Axis forces in North Africa which led to a 28-month aerial campaign. The He 111 along with the Ju 88 took on deep offensive bombing operations from the very beginning. In January 1941 a number of Kampfgeschwaders carried out raids against the Royal Navy and Allied convoys.Mackay 2003, pp. 112-117. KG 26 was the first unit to be used in this capacity. Some of the early raids were costly despite the lack opposition. On night of 17/18 January 12 of KG 26s machines set out to bomb Benghazi, seven of eight were lost after running out of fuel. Successes were frequent and the minesweeper HMS Huntley and the freighter Sollum were sunk.de Zeng 2007 Vol 1, p. 85. A number of He 111 units, mostly KG 26, also supported the German invasion of Crete.Mackay 2003, p. 129. During the Balkans conflict and following attack on the Soviet Union, most of the bomber operations in the theatre fell to the Ju 88 and Junkers Ju 87 equipped units. The He 111s returned during the winter of 1941/42 during the stalemate on the Soviet-German front. Throughout 1941-1942, the small numbers of He 111s assisted in the attempt to starve Malta into surrender. With most of RAF Fighter Command concentrated on the Channel Front, the He 111s and the Luftwaffe came close to achieving this by gradually strangling the sea supply routes and forcing a partial collapse of British sea power in the central Mediterranean Sea. The Allied forces on Malta were considering surrender as late as November 1942. It was not until later that month the attacks ceased and the siege was lifted.Taylor & Man 1974, p. 182. Soviet- German war, 1941‚àí45 On 22 June 1941 Adolf Hitler initiated Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The Heinkel order of battle on this date amounted to three Kampfgeschwader. , committed to Luftflotte 2 attached to Army Group North. was committed Luftflotte 4 Army Group Centre and KG 55, allocated to V. Fliegerkorps. As in the previous campaigns the He 111 were to provide tactical support to the German Army. Little thought was given to strategic bombing. It was thought that such an undertaking would not be required until the conquest of the European part of the Soviet Union west of a line connecting the cities of Arkhangelsk and Astrakhan, often referred to as the A-A line.Mackay 2003, p. 139. During 1941-1942 the tactical use of the He 111 was limited owing to its limited manoeuvrability and bulky airframe. The He 111 was switched to the job of \\"train busting\\". The only specialised German ground attack aircraft was the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka and Henschel Hs 123, but both lacked the necessary range. The only recourse was to \\"employ\\" the He 111, along with the Ju 88.Mackay 2003, p. 149. Some units had success, for example KG 55 destroyed or damaged 122 train loads, along with claims of 64 locomotives. The Soviets set up countermeasures in the form of heavy concentrations of anti-aircraft artillery which caused losses to increase, particularly in inexperienced crews. 's special train busting staffel (Eis)./KG 55 suffered some 10 percent losses.Mackay 2003, pp. 150-151. During the winter battles of 1941, the He 111 reverted to a transport aircraft. The He 111 helped evacuate 21,000 soldiers from the Demyansk pocket, while transporting some 24,300 tons of food and ammunition. The He 111 proved invaluable in the \\"battle of the pockets\\".Mackay 2003, p. 154. Later, in 1942, the He 111 participated in the Battle of Stalingrad. During the Soviet Operation Uranus, which encircled the German Sixth Army, the He 111 fleet once again was asked to fly in supplies. The operation failed and the Sixth Army was destroyed. Some 165 He 111s were lost to heavily entrenched Soviet defences around the city during the siege.Hayward 2001, p. 310. The He 111 operated in the same capacity as in previous campaigns on the Eastern Front. The bomber was asked to perform strategic bombing functions. Targeting Soviet industry had not been high on the OKL's agenda in 1941-42, but prior to the Battle of Kursk several attempts were made to destroy Soviet military production. The tank factory at Gorkovskiy Avtomobilniy Zavod (GAZ) was subjected to a series of heavy attacks throughout June 1943. On the night of 4/5 June, He 111s of Kampfgeschwader 1, KG 3, KG 4, KG 55 and KG 100 dropped 161 tonnes (179 tons) of bombs, causing massive destruction to buildings and production lines. All of GAZ No. 1 plant's 50 buildings, 9,000 m (29,500 ft) of conveyors, 5,900 pieces of equipment and 8,000 tank engines were destroyed.Bergstr√∂m 2007 p. 20 However, the Germans made an error in target selection. The GAZ plant No. 1 produced only the T-70 light tank. Factory No. 112, the second-biggest producer of the more formidable T-34, continued production undisturbed. Soviet production facilities were repaired or rebuilt within six weeks. In 1943, Factory No. 112 produced 2,851 T-34s, 3,619 in 1944, and 3,255 in 1945. The Luftwaffe had also failed to hit the Gorkiy Artillery Factory (No. 92) or the aircraft plant where the Lavochkin La-5 and La 5FN were made. The Luftwaffe failed to disrupt the Soviet preparation for the coming battle, but the He 111 had proved capable of operating in a strategic role. The He 111 also formed the core of the strategic bombing offensive later in the year. During the Soviet Lower Dnieper Offensive He 111 Geschwader performed strike missions. Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring issued an order to General Rudolf Meister's IV. Fliegerkorps on 14 October 1943: > I intend to initiate systematic attacks against the Russian arms industry by > deploying the bulk of the heavy bomber units [mostly equipped with medium > bombers] - reinforced by special units - which will be brought together > under the command of IV. Fliegerkorps. The task will be to deal destructive > strikes against the Russian arms industry in order to wipe out masses of > Russian tanks, artillery pieces and aircraft before they reach the front, > thus providing the hard-pressed Ostheer [East Army] with relief which will > be much greater than if these bombers were deployed on the > battlefield.Bergstrom 2008, p. 133. Soviet fighter opposition had made strategic bombing in daylight too costly and so German bombers crews were retrained in the winter of 1943/44 to fly night operations. The offensive began on the night of the 27/28 March 1944, with some 180 to 190 He 111s taking part and dropping an average of 200 tons of bombs. On the night of 30 April/1 May 1944, 252 sorties were flown, the highest number during the offensive. The targets were mainly Soviet marshalling yards in the western and eastern Ukraine. Later in the summer, 1944, the He 111 once again operated with success as part of the shrinking German bomber force. German industry began to move factories eastward, out of the range of RAF Bomber Command and United States Army Air Forces attacks. In response, the USAAF started shuttle missions to the Soviet Union in which they would continue on and land in the USSR after their mission. The USAAF would then repeat the mission and continue to England. IV. Fliegerkorps was ordered to target the airfields of the USAAF bombers. On 21 June 1944, the US Eighth Air Force's B-17 Flying Fortresses landed at Mirgorod and Poltava airfields after bombing targets in Debrecen, Hungary. The Soviets had not prepared proper anti-aircraft defences and IV. Fliegerkorps and its He 111s from KG 4, KG 53 and KG 55 dropped 91 tonnes (100 tons) of bombs destroying 44 B-17s and 15 US fighters. The He 111s flew at altitudes of 4,000-5,000 m (13,120-16,400 m), and not a single German aircraft was hit by enemy fire. Such missions were halted thereafter. The suspending of the \\"shuttle missions\\" (known as Operation Frantic) was assessed by the Germans as a result of the Soviet failure to provide appropriate protection. It is likely, however, that the B-17 and P-51's, which now had the range to strike anywhere in Europe, and had bases that could reach Eastern Europe in Italy, did not fly shuttle missions to the Soviet Union owing to these reasons.Mackay 2003, p. 171. Late war operations A German Luftwaffe Heinkel He 111 H-22. This version could carry FZG 76 (V1) flying bombs, but only a few aircraft were produced in 1944. Some were used by bomb wing KG 3.. By the spring, 1943, the numbers of He 111s in operational combat units was declining. The introduction of more powerful bombers, mostly the Junkers Ju 88, but also the Dornier Do 217 (as a rival anti-shipping attack aircraft) forced the He 111 out of service.Griehl 2008, pp. 8-9. Luftwaffe offensive operations were largely halted after late 1943 owing to Allied air superiority.Griehl 2008, p. 9. Nevertheless, the anti- shipping missions continued against the Soviet Navy in the Black Sea. The late model He 111 H-16s in particular were fitted with FuG 200 Hohentwiel anti- shipping radar (German language). The armament of the FuG 200 equipped He 111s consisted of several difference types of Anti-ship missiles.Mackay 2003, p. 172. The Henschel Hs 293 L-10 Friedensengel, a glider-mounted torpedo and the Blohm & Voss Bv 143 and Blohm & Voss BV 246 rocket-assisted glide bombs. Only the Hs 293s reached the operational stage. The Hs 293 was controlled by the FuG 203b Kehl III guidance control box. After the bomb was released, and the rocket fuelled power unit ignited, the rocket cleared the aircraft and was then in sight of the bomb aimer. The aimer controlled the lever of the FuG 203 to adjust the angle of the missile's control surfaces. Flares were attached to the missiles to allow the crew to track the direction of the missile until impact.Mackay 2003, p. 172. Other variants such as the He 111H-16/R3 and H-20/R2 pathfinders carried V-1 flying bombs to their targets in London as part of Adolf Hitler's \\"vengeance\\" campaign. The V-1s had been launched from northern France and the German occupied Netherlands, but of the 2,000 launched some 50 percent had reached London, of which 661 were shot down. The He 111H-21 and H-22 were asked to deliver the V-1s when the British and Canadian 21st Army Group liberated the Netherlands and overran the landing sites. Some of the H-22s were loaded with Fieseler Fi 103R (Reichenberg) missiles.Nowarra 1980, p. 229. The conditions of late 1944 differed greatly from the \\"Blitz\\" of 1940-41. RAF nightfighters carried the AI Mk IV metric wavelength radar and the high performance of types like the de Havilland Mosquito ensured German bomber crews had to stay low to the surface of the sea to avoid early detection, while flying the North Sea route to the British coast. Flying at low-level for long periods carried heavy risk of collision with a rising wave. In order to have any chance of surviving, crews were forced to wear bulky immersion suits and inflatable life vests that made the average flight, of three to five hours, very uncomfortable.Mackay 2003, pp. 179-180. The raids usually started from the radio beacon at Den Helder, the Netherlands. When the release point was reached, the pilot would climb to 1,600 ft (500m) and release the payload before retreating back to low altitude. The return journey was just as dangerous at that time. Mosquito units operating over the Netherlands and continent posed a threat to He 111s as they sought to land. In late 1944 and 1945, the He 111 reverted to a transport role. It helped evacuate Axis forces from Greece and Yugoslavia in October - November 1944. He 111 units also transported men and material out of Budapest, during the siege of the city, while He 111s of Kampfgeschwader 4 assaulted Soviet bridgeheads and laid mines in the Danube to hamper the Red Army from crossing the river. The remaining He 111s withdrew from the Hungarian front after the siege ended in February 1945 to concentrate on destroying the bridges over the Oder river as the Soviet advance was nearing Berlin.Mackay 2003, pp. 177-179. Professor Heinkel said of the He 111s performance during the war: > They became reliable, proven and easily maintained worker-bees for the > Luftwaffe bomber units. Even though, after 1941, they had been technically > superseded and, above all were hampered by their lack of range..and, despite > repeated modifications, could not be given the additional range required- > there was really no substitute for them.Nowarra 1980, p. 233.

Purportedly inspired by the teaching of his father, he embarked on a semi- peaceful coexistence policy with his southern rivals of the 11th Dynasty, focusing on improving the prosperity of his realm centered on Herakleopolis instead of waging an open war with Thebes. His policy was not rewarded, and shortly after his death his kingdom was conquered by the Theban Mentuhotep II, marking the beginning of the Middle Kingdom. The existence of his pyramid has historically been ascertained, although it has not yet been discovered. Reign Biography According to many scholars, he ruled at the end of the 10th Dynasty in his middle-age,Flinders Petrie, A History of Egypt, from the Earliest Times to the XVIth Dynasty (1897), pp. 115-16.William C. Hayes, op. cit. p. 996.Nicolas Grimal, A History of Ancient Egypt, Oxford, Blackwell Books, 1992, pp. 141‚Äì45.Michael Rice, Who is who in Ancient Egypt, 1999 (2004), Routledge, London, , p. 113. following a long reign by his father. The identity of his predecessor (the so-called \\"Khety III\\" who was the purported author of the Teaching for King Merikare) is still a question of debate among Egyptologists. Some scholars tend to identify Merikare's predecessor with Wahkare Khety.William C. Hayes, op. cit. p. 466‚Äì67. These sebayt (\\"teachings\\", in ancient Egyptian) ‚Äì possibly composed during the reign of Merikare and fictitiously attributed to his father ‚Äì are a collection of precepts for good governance. The text also mentions the eastern borders, recently secured, but still in need of the king's attention.William C. Hayes, op. cit. p. 237. In the text, Merikare's unnamed father mentions having sacked Thinis, but he advises Merikare to deal more leniently with the troublesome Upper Egyptian realms. Once crowned, around 2075 BCE,Miriam Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, vol. 2. pp. 97-109. University of California Press 1980, , p. 97. Merikare wisely resigned himself to the existence of two separate kingdoms (the Herakleopolite and the Theban ones) and tried to maintain the policy of peaceful coexistence achieved by his father. It seems that the period of peace brought a certain amount of prosperity to Merikare's realm. Some time later, the pharaoh was forced to sail up the Nile with his court on a great fleet. Once he reached Asyut, the king installed the loyalist nomarch Khety II, who succeeded his deceased father Tefibi; he also made restorations at the local temple of Wepwawet. After that, Merikare advanced farther upstream to the town of Shashotep, likely to quell a revolt, and at the same time as a show of force to the turbulent southern border areas.Alan Gardiner, Egypt of the Pharaohs. An introduction, Oxford University Press, 1961, p. 113. Merikare died in c. 2040 BCE, a few months before the fall of Herakleopolis. Thus, the final defeat by the Thebans, led by Mentuhotep II of the 11th Dynasty, was likely inflicted upon an ephemeral, unnamed successor. Burial Stele of Anpuemhat, attesting the funerary cult of Merikare in Saqqara during the 12th Dynasty Many sources suggest that Merikare was buried in a yet-undiscovered pyramid in Saqqara, called Flourishing are the Abodes of Merikare, that had to be near to the pyramid of Teti of the 6th Dynasty. The titles of the officials involved in its construction are documented, as his funerary cult endured into the 12th Dynasty; in fact, Merikare's cartouche appears on the stelae of at least four priests who were responsible for the funerary cult of Teti and Merikare during the Middle Kingdom.James Edward Quibell, Excavations at Saqqara (1905-1906), Le Caire, Impr. de l'Institut fran√ßais d'arch√©ologie orientale (1907), p. 20 ff; pl. XIII, XV. They include Gemniemhat who also held other important positions. Attestations Despite his name cannot be recognized in the Turin King List, Merikare is the most attested among the Herakleopolite rulers. His name appears on: *the Teaching for King Merikare; *a wooden scribe palette belonging to the chancellor Orkaukhety, found in a tomb near Asyut (along with a brazier dedicated to Meryibre Khety) and now at the Louvre; *the inscriptions from the tomb of the nomarch Khety II, in Asyut; *nine steles attesting the existence of his pyramid and his funerary cult in Saqqara.Arkadi F. Demidchik (2003), \\"The reign of Merikare Khety\\", G√∂ttinger Miszellen 192, pp. 25‚Äì36. Hypothesis of an earlier reign In 2003, the Egyptologist Arkadi F. Demidchik suggested that Merikare's placement within the dynasty should be reconsidered. According to him, if Merikare reigned during the campaign led by Mentuhotep II then the former's pyramid and its cult couldn't have survived the Theban conquest; again, Merikare likely would not be able to obtain granite from the South as mentioned in the Teachings. Demidchik also argued that the battles for Thinis mentioned by Tefibi and Merikare were the same, being fought in the opposite front by the Theban ruler Wahankh Intef II, thus suggesting that Merikare's reign should be placed some decades earlier than usually thought, when the 10th Dynasty's power was at its peak.

History The village is the site of Crkvi≈°te-Morobizdon, a complex of late-antique and medieval localities. The village was inhabited from the 5th to 7th centuries, when it was abandoned. A church dating from the 5th century was discovered on this location, with a tomb as its centre. With its marble flooring and pillars and capitals decorated with medieval motifs, it has been concluded that this church represents a great example of the highest technical level of construction and decoration. In the 9th century, the Slavs settled in the area. From the 10th to the 15th century, the settlement was a religious center of the Bregalnica region. During the last years of the First Bulgarian Empire under the reign of Tsar Samuil it became a bishopric center in the framework of the Bulgarian Archbishopric of Ohrid. The prosperity of the city of the Morobizdon and Morodvis bishopric ended towards the end of the 12th century, when the Serbian church became dominant in the region. A Romanesque church was also discovered, and it originates from this period. The church is an example of the medieval architectural concept, fresco-painted, with flooring made in sextuple technique and church furniture made of carved stone. During the 13th century, a new smaller church was built on the site of the older church, around which a necropolis was discovered, dating between the 12th and the 19th centuries, with more than 350 graves that contained artifacts made of gold, bronze, bone, glass and textile. In 1347, as a result of a decision by the church council at its meeting held in Skopje, the headquarters of the bishopric was moved to Zletovo.

He majored in linguistics at Columbia University, where he graduated in 1978, having studied concurrently at New York's Herzliah Yiddish Teachers' Seminary. He relocated to London in 1978 to work on a doctorate (completed in 1982) on the origins of the Semitic component in the Yiddish language at the University of London, where he won the John Marshall Medal in Comparative Philology (1980).The thesis is online at: https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/PDFLinguistics/1982.pdf . In his early linguistic work, he began to argue for \\"continual transmission\\" of the Semitic component in Yiddish from Hebrew through to Aramaic through to Yiddish, challenging the standard \\"text theory\\" that postulated entrance principally via religious texts later on.(1979) \\"A yerushe fun kadmoynim: der semitisher kheylek in yidish\\" in . He proposed novel reconstructions for parts of the proto-Yiddish vowel system,Dovid Katz, \\"First steps in the reconstruction of the proto vocalism of the Semitic component in Yiddish\\", Dec. 1977, seminar paper available at: https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/PDFLinguistics/1977.pdf . modifications in the classification of Yiddish dialects,Dovid Katz, \\"Zur Dialektologie des Jiddischen\\" in W.

Katz (ed), \\"Origins of the Yiddish Language\\", Pergamon 1987, pp. 47-60. Over the years he published papers in Yiddish and English on various \\"history of ideas\\" topics, including the role of Aramaic in Aramaic-Hebrew-Yiddish internal Ashkenazi trilingualism (he rejected the notion of a single fused Hebrew-hyphen-Aramaic); medieval rabbinic disputes over Yiddish; rabbinic contributions to Yiddish dialectology; the importance of the German underworld language Rotwelsch for Yiddish linguistics; Christian studies in Yiddish; and the 19th century roots of religious Yiddishism, among others.Papers on these and related topics are listed and posted on Katz's website . For eighteen years (1978‚Äì1996) he taught Yiddish Studies at Oxford, building from scratch, sometimes single-handedly, the Oxford Programme in Yiddish. It grew in the 1980s and 1990s into an international program. His contributions include initiating a new four-week summer coursehttps://dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_oxford.htm#4 Four-week summer course at four levels of language instruction (in 1982), the annual Stencl Lecture (from 1983),https://www.dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_periodicals.htm#Stencl Annual Stencl LectureKatz edited the first six lectures in pamphlet form between 1984 and 1989; see:https://www.dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_periodicals.htm ; also Mementos of the early Stencl Lectures annual winter symposiums (from 1985);https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_oxford.htm#5 Winter symposiums University of Oxford BA, MSt and MPhil options (from 1982), and a doctoral program (from 1984), these being concentrated in the University's Faculty of Medieval and Modern Languages.Various illustrative documents from the period are posted at: https://www.dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_oxford.htm . His former doctoral students are today professors of Yiddish at Indiana University (Bloomington) and D√ºsseldorf among others. He founded the series Winter Studies in Yiddish in English (vol. 1 appeared in 1987),Four volumes appeared of which Katz edited the first two: and ; mementos of the project and Oksforder Yidish (or \\"Oxford Yiddish\\"), entirely in Yiddish (vol. 1 appeared in 1990).Three vols. appeared, edited by Katz: 1 (1990) and 2 (1991) in standard format; vol. 3 (1995) is a large 1000 columned folio. The series was launched at the London Press Centre . His posts, at the Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies (renamed the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies) were instructor and junior fellow (1978‚Äì1982), senior research fellow and director of Yiddish studies (1983‚Äì1994). In 1994 he founded the Oxford Institute for Yiddish Studies and served as its research director until 1997.American Jewish Yearbook, 1998, Vol. 98. Ed. David Singer. New York: American Jewish Committee, 1998. . p. 245. He was Research Fellow at St. Antony's College Oxford from 1986 to 1997, and a member of the Modern Language Faculty's Graduate Studies Committee from 1984 to 1997. After an initial trip to his ancestral Lithuania and Belarus in 1990 (during which he negotiated an agreementhttps://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/06/arts/lithuania-and-oxford-are- linked-by-yiddish.html Agreement enabling Lithuanian students to enroll in Oxford Jewish studies courses), Katz pioneered the mounting of in-situ post- Holocaust Yiddish dialectological and folkloristic expeditions in Eastern Europe. He focused on the \\"Lithuanian lands\\" (Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, etc.) and continues work on his Atlas of Northeastern Yiddish.Around thirty maps have appeared to date on the in-progress web version of the Atlas at: https://www.dovidkatz.net/WebAtlas/AtlasSamples.htm . He has amassed thousands of hours of recorded interviews with \\"the last of the Yiddish Mohicans\\" in these regions but as far as is known has thus far failed to find a permanent home for the materials. In early 2013 he began posting clips from his interviews of Boro Park Yiddish speakers gleaned from his return trips to his native Brooklyn.His earliest collection constituted a Youtube playlist on his channel. His publications on Yiddish language include his \\"Grammar of the Yiddish Language\\" (London, 1987) and his book in Yiddish, \\"Tikney takones. Fragn fun yidisher stilistik\\" (Oxford, 1993),https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/PDFStylistics/1993.pdf \\"Tikney takones. Fragn fun yidisher stilistik\\" both of which aimed to enhance the teaching of Yiddish as a vibrant language both spoken and for new literary and academic works, even if in (and for) small circles. In both works, he advocated a descriptivist stance, rejecting what he considered to be the excessive purism prevalent in the field, particularly in New York. He also (controversially) championed the traditionalist variant of modern Yiddish orthography, and was the author of the \\"Code of Yiddish Spelling\\" (Oxford, 1992).https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/PDFStylistics/1992.pdf \\"Code of Yiddish Spelling\\" He twice founded and directed (one-time only) Yiddish teacher training programs: at Oxford, a one-year program in 1996, and at Vilnius, an intensive course in spring 2005. For a nonspecialist English readership he wrote a history of the language and its culture, \\"Words on Fire: The Unfinished Story of Yiddish\\" (Basic Books 2004, revised edition with added academic apparatus, 2007), which attracted both acclaim and robust debate, particularly over his predictions of a vernacular future for Yiddish based in Haredi communities, and his contention that modern Hebrew could not replace the European-nuanced vibrancy of Yiddish.Reviews include Zachary Sholem Berger in the Forward (Oct 29, 2004), Jeremy Dauber in the New York Sun (Nov 3, 2004), Norman Lebrecht in the Evening Standard (March 21, 2005), Susanne Marten-Finnis in the Times Higher Education Supplement (Oct 6, 2006), Julia Pascal in the Independent (March 4, 2005), Miriam Shaviv in the Jerusalem Post (2004), Gene Shaw in Library Journal (Dec. 2004), Joseph Sherman in the Times Literary Supplement (May 27, 2005). For years he wrote regular columns for the Forverts (1990s), and in more recent years for the Algemeiner Journal,DovidKatz.net has a number of his Algemeiner Zhurnal (Algemeyner zhurnal) posted, on the pages for Yiddish studies and for Lithuanian issues . which seemed to have stopped with the departure of Y.Y. Jacobson as editor around 2010. In 2015, his book Yiddish and Power was published in the UK by Palgrave Macmillan. He is the author of a number of articles on Yiddish in encyclopedias (including The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe)https://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Language/Yiddish YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern EuropeHe later posted a slightly Amended version on his website. and book introductions, including the Yivo's reprint of Alexander Harkavy's trilingual Yiddish-English-Hebrew dictionary.Michels, Tony (2005).

After a year as visiting professor at Yale University (1998‚Äì1999), Katz relocated to Vilnius in 1999 in order to take up a new chair in Yiddish language, literature and culture at Vilnius University, and to found the university's Center for Stateless Cultures,https://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/939/ Center for Stateless Cultures which he directed for its first two years. He had relocated his old Oxford Yiddish summer program to Vilnius a year earlier (summer 1998). In 2001, he founded the Vilnius Yiddish Institute at Vilnius University and remained its research director and primary instructor until 2010. His works on Litvak (Lithuanian Jewish) culture include the folio volume \\"Lithuanian Jewish Culture\\" (Baltos lankos, Vilnius 2004, revised edition 2010), \\"Windows to a Lost Jewish Past: Vilna Book Stamps\\" (Versus aureus, Vilnius 2008), and \\"Seven Kingdoms of the Litvaks\\" (International Cultural Program Center, Vilnius 2009).https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/Lithuania/7_KingdomsLitvaks.pdf \\"Seven Kingdoms of the Litvaks\\" In 2009 he directed the \\"Jewish Lithuania\\" program for Summer Literary Seminars in Vilnius. He has proposed \\"Litvak Studies\\"https://defendinghistory.com/litvak-studies \\"Litvak Studies\\" as a potential program of study. He began to write short stories in Yiddish following his father's death in 1991, and published three collections in book form in the 1990s under the nom de plume Heershadovid Menkes (Yiddish: ◊î◊ô◊®◊©◊¢÷æ◊ì◊ï◊ì ◊û◊¢◊ô◊†◊ß◊¢◊°‚ÄîHirshe-Dovid Meynkes): Eldra Don, 1992; The Flat Peak, 1993; Tales of the Misnagdim from Vilna Province, 1996. After experimenting with modern themes, he abandoned them for the vanished life of old Jewish Lithuania, to some extent violating norms of modern Yiddish to write works set in older Jewish Lithuania in local dialect. Awards for his fiction came from within the secular Yiddish environment: the Hirsh Rosenfeld Award (Canadian Jewish Congress, 1994), the Zhitlovsky Prize (Ikuf, 1996) and the most prestigious Yiddish literary award, the Itzik Manger Prize, in 1997. In 1994 he founded at Oxford the then sole literary monthly magazine in Yiddish, \\"Yiddish Pen\\"https://www.dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_periodicals.htm#YP \\"Yiddish Pen\\" and edited its first 27 issues.See: https://www.dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_periodicals.htm It did not, however, usher in the literary revival he had hoped for, and his own works of fiction received little recognition outside the narrow world of secular Yiddish culture. Years, later translated anthologies of his short stories appeared in 2012, in EnglishCity in the Moonlight: Stories of the Old-time Lithuanian Jews. Yiddish stories by Dovid Katz.

Katz, taken aback by the poverty he found among the last aged Yiddish speakers in Eastern Europe (many of them \\"flight survivors\\" who survived the war by fleeing to the Soviet Union, hence not eligible for aid under the narrow definition of \\"Holocaust survivor\\"), alerted the wider world to the issue in a 1999 op- edhttps://dovidkatz.net/dovid/Lithuania/1999-How%20to%20help%20the%20Holocausts%20Last%20Victims.jpg 1999 op-ed in the Forward, which was cited by Judge Edward R. Korman in the Swiss Banks settlement The Swiss Banks settlement in the U.S. District Court in 2004. Katz began to work closely with the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) on these issues, and he helped inspire and inform the 2004 founding of the Survivor Mitzvah Project by a group based in Santa Monica, California. In October 2012, he took part in the Channel 4 reality series \\"Jewish Mum of the Year\\" as one of the judging panel alongside Tracy- Ann Oberman and Richard Ferrer.See Richard Ferrer in the Independent,16 Oct 2012, online at: https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/channel-4s-jewish-mum-of-the- year-was-my-idea-and-im-proud-of-it-8209464.html. Most of the reviews of his own appearance judged it negativelySee the reviews by Tom Sutcliffe in the Independent and John Crace in the Guardian. and it seems he did not think much of the program himself. In 2013, he initiated a \\"Virtual Mini Museum of Old Jewish Vilna\\" with item descriptions in Yiddish and index in English. In June 2014, two articles in Tablet magazine focused on the recent history and status of Yiddish linguistics, including his own contributions (and controversies).See Cherie Woodworth's \\"Where did Yiddish come from?\\" and Batya Ungar-Sargon's \\"The mystery of the origins of Yiddish will never be solved\\" Katz promptly responded (in Yiddish).Dovid Katz, \\"Tsu der zorglozer dekonstruktsye fun Maks Vaynraykhn\\" In 2015, he embarked on a project to translate the (Hebrew) Bible into Lithuanian Yiddish.His online contents of the translations to date are at: https://defendinghistory.com/lithuanian- yiddish-bible-translations By mid-2016, he had posted drafts of Daniel, Esther, Kings I, Kings II, Lamentations, and Ruth. Around the same time, he initiated a \\"Virtual Mini Museum of Old Jewish Vilna\\" with item descriptions in Yiddish and index in English. By 2018, he had added several more books (and completed the Five Megillot), and published in booklet form The Book of Ruth in Lithuanian Yiddish (Vilnius 2017). In 2018, to honor the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the modern Lithuanian republic in 1918, he initiated a new online Yiddish \\"mini-museum\\" stressing interwar Yiddish-Lithuanian multicultural and bilingual life. The same year, he launched online his Yiddish Cultural Dictionary which is an English-Yiddish dictionary (still in an early stage) stressing cultural specificities and with all discussions of entries in Yiddish. It is rooted in his earlier descriptivist work in Yiddish stylistics, and is inherently opposed to some of the more normative and purist trends in Yiddish stylistics in the United States.  Holocaust History and Human Rights Activism  After observing the Vilnius scene for years, Dovid Katz began in 2008 to publicly challenge the \\"double genocide\\" theory of World War II and the accusations against Holocaust survivors who survived by joining the Jewish partisans. In a Rothschild Foundation London seminar in February that year he proposed the term \\"Holocaust Obfuscation\\" for an East European trend to downgrade the Holocaust into one of two purportedly equal genocides (without actually denying any deaths); he refined the term in a 2009 paper.Dovid Katz, \\"On three definitions: Genocide; Holocaust Denial; Holocaust Obfuscation\\" in L. Donskis, ed., \\"A Litmus Test Case of Modernity (etc.), Peter Lang 2009, pp. 259-277. Online at: https://www.defendinghistory.com/2009SeptDovidKatz3Definitions.pdf When, in May 2008, Lithuanian prosecutors launched investigations of two more elderly Holocaust survivors, Fania Yocheles Brantsovsky and Dr. Rachel Margolis, Katz embarked on a new activist phase of his life. He became a staunch advocate for the accused Holocaust survivors who were under investigation, and played a role in mobilizing the Western diplomatic community in Vilnius to support them. Results, achieved in partnership with Vilnius-based diplomats, included a reception by the Irish ambassador for Ms. Brantsovsky, awarding her a certificate,https://holocaustinthebaltics.com/2June2008IrishEmbassy.JPG A certificate on 3 June 2008 (the same day the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism was signed), and a certificate of merithttps://holocaustinthebaltics.com/30April2008USEmbassyCertificatetoFania.jpg Certificate of merit from the American ambassador. This was followed in August that year by a letter from nine NATO-member embassieshttps://www.holocaustinthebaltics.com/25August2008fromninewesternemnbassies.pdf A letter from nine NATO-member embassies to Dr. Rachel Margolis in Rehovot, Israel, and, in 2010, by a letter from seven European ambassadorshttps://defendinghistory.com/ambassadors-protest-antisemitism-in- lithuania/6362 A letter from seven European ambassadors that noted the legalization of swastikas that year, renewed Holocaust denial, and the attempts to \\"equalize\\" Nazi and Soviet crimes.

When the law was applied to a left-wing politician with whom he disagreed wholly on the 1991 events in question, Katz nevertheless felt it important to speak out for free speech,https://defendinghistory.com/on-the-paleckis-trial-in- vilnius/14504 Free speech and, in a reply to Rokas Grajauskas in Lithuanian Foreign Policy Reviewhttps://defendinghistory.com/13705/13705 Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review made clear his view that objecting to Holocaust Obfuscation in no way signifies reluctance to expose Stalinist crimes. In recent years, Katz has registered concern regarding purported policy shifts toward Holocaust Obfuscation and Double Genocide by the United States Department of State, in articles in Tablet (2010), The Guardian (2010)https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/dec/21/double- genocide-baltic-us-europe Guardian Algemeiner Journal (2011), The Times of Israel (2012) and a list of publications maintained on DefendingHistory.com.https://defendinghistory.com/category/us-state-dept- manipulated List of publications maintained on DefendingHistory.com He also spoke out regarding alliances binding the UK's Conservative Party with controversial East European right wing politics, in The Irish Times (2009),https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/1031/1224257766699.html Irish Times The Guardian (2010), The Jewish Chronicle (2010), and the London Jewish News (2012).https://defendinghistory.com/wp- content/uploads/2012/12/Dovid-Katz-op-ed-in-London-Jewish-News-13-Dec-2012.pdf Jewish News Analogously, he challenged Israeli foreign policy on alleged acequiscence to Holocaust Obfuscation in return for diplomatic support, in venues including the Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs,https://defendinghistory.com/wp- content/uploads/2013/01/2010IsraelJournalofForeignAffairsDovidKatz.pdf Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs The Jerusalem Post, The Times of Israel and DefendingHistory.com.https://defendinghistory.com/category/israel DefendingHistory.com In the spring of 2011, Katz was Jan Randa Visiting Scholar at the Australian Center for Jewish Civilization (ACJC) at Monash University in Melbourne where he lectured on both Yiddish Studies and Holocaust issues. He has worked to define the new and \\"nuanced\\" elitist East European antisemitism and its success in attracting unsuspecting westerners to help provide political cover. He presented findings at Yale Universityhttps://holocaustinthebaltics.com/wp- content/uploads/2011/04/YALE14Apr2011.pdf.pdf Yale University and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in 2011, and at a December 13, 2012 ISGAP event at Fordham Universityhttps://vimeo.com/55692172 December 13, 2012 ISGAP event at Fordham University in New York City.

Unexpectedly for many in his circles, he became, in 2015, a staunch opponent of plans to locate a national convention center on the grounds of Vilnius's 15th century-origin old Jewish cemetery. His activities included helping inspire an array of international published protest statements,See: https://defendinghistory.com/who-is-opposed-to-the-convention-center-on-the- old-vilna-jewish-cemetery-at-piramont-in-snipiskes/75558 maintaining a monitoring section in Defending History.See: https://defendinghistory.com/category/jewish-cemetery-piramont-snipiskes- shnipishok One summary of his views appeared in The Times of Israel in late 2015.See Dovid Katz, \\"Lithuania's Liveliest Cemetery\\" in The Times of Israel, 13 December 2015 (https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/lithuanias-liveliest- cemetery/).

In July 2018, the Colorado Mounted Rangers ceased their operational activities, transitioning those roles to the newly formed Colorado Rangers Law Enforcement Shared Reserve, a government agency. CMR rangers annually provided more than 50,000 volunteer hours to the State of Colorado supporting local police and sheriffs departments by providing additional peace officer resources in times of need.

History Reorganization Law Enforcement Auxiliary per C.R.S ¬ß 24-33.5-822 Rangers working alongside local Police Department In 2012, thanks to a non-partisan effort by the Colorado General Assembly, Governor John Hickenlooper signed Senate Bill 12-072 (Link) into law, formally recognizing the Ranger's role as a Law Enforcement Auxiliary in the Colorado State Statutes. \\"Therefore, the general assembly declares that the Colorado Mounted Rangers should be established as an all-volunteer, unpaid auxiliary unit for the purpose of lending assistance to...law enforcement agencies in the state.\\" SB12-072 Section 24-32-2222 in Senate Bill 12-072 was then harmonized with House Bill 12-1283 and relocated to section 24-33.5-822 placing the Rangers under the Department of Public Safety in 24-33.5 C.R.S. While the Rangers had been operating under formal memoranda of understanding (MOU's) with agencies across the State, this legislation formalized the Colorado Mounted Rangers' role as the State Law Enforcement Auxiliary and clarified it in the Colorado Revised Statutes.

Early history of guerrilla librarians, 1990s With the rise of electronic resources, some more ‚Äútraditional‚Äù librarians in the San Francisco Public Library system were reported to hide books to protect them from destruction. In a column in the April 1997 ALA publication American Libraries, the reference librarian Will Manley referred to these librarians as ‚Äúguerrilla librarians.‚Äù Manley, Will. \\"Guerrilla librarians.\\" American Libraries, April 1997., 192, Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts with Full Text, EBSCOhost (accessed November 2, 2009). The librarians attempted to save the books marked for destruction or the discard pile by stamping them with incorrect due dates.Wisner, William H. Whither the Postmodern Library? Libraries, Technology, and Education in the Information Age. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland and Company, Inc., 2000. Background In 1987, a planning study was conducted by library consultants Becker & Hayes Inc. This study found that ‚ÄúThe library will pursue an active 'weeding' program in the next two decades to extend the useful life of the facility... up to 50 percent of the material could be located off-site.‚Äù In 1988, Proposition A was passed by voters to provide $109.5 million for the New Main Library to double existing space and would be applied to just the new building.November 8, 1988 San Francisco Voter Pamphlet Other resources such as furniture and equipment had to be covered by the public-private partnership called The Library Foundation. After the October 17, 1989 earthquake in San Francisco, City Librarian Ken Dowlin applied to the Federal Emergency Management Authority for a $1 million grant. With this funding, he changed the organization of the books from the Dewey Decimal System to a system he referred to as ‚Äúleveled access.‚Äù The Mercury Project involved the purchase of new computers, including a supercomputer from the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) for an online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC). The Alexandrian Project aimed to build a new main library building using computers and electronic resources more than books. In 1995, 250,000 library books were weeded, including old, rare and some last copies. Some librarians resisted this idea of the ‚ÄúLibrary of the Future‚Äù that Dowlin had envisioned. This resistance to these changes created the term ‚Äúguerrilla librarian,‚Äù a librarian who saves books from destruction by either hiding them or stamping them to make the books appear that they had been in recent circulation.Biller, Walter; Kirwan, Jim & Slade, Suzanne. ‚ÄúHigh Tech Barbarians at the Gates: The Plunder of the San Francisco Public Library.‚Äù San Francisco Frontlines, (San Francisco, CA) June 1997. Reprint of San Francisco Frontlines June 1997 Article In the Word Watch of April 1997, The Atlantic Monthly defined guerrilla librarianship as ‚Äúthe use of surreptitious measures by librarians determined to resist the large-scale 'deaccessioning' of rarely used books: 'A branch librarian ... sometimes goes around with a due-date stamp, furtively stamping into currency books that she feels are imperiled.... [Employees of the San Francisco Public Library] call it ‚Äúguerrilla librarianship‚Äù' (The New Yorker).‚ÄùSoukhanov, Anne H. ‚ÄúWord Watch‚Äù The Atlantic Online. April 1997 Word Watch Current guerrilla librarianship In more recent history, the term ‚Äúguerrilla librarian‚Äù has been used to refer to Mick Jones of The Clash. His recent efforts in July 2009 created the Rock-n-Roll Public Library in London. Including 10,000 items from the guitarist's private collection, the library also contains Clash artwork and Beatles memorabilia. This exhibition is free as a ‚Äúdirect artistic challenge to the likes of the corporate British Music Experience.‚ÄùClash guitarist Mick Jones has become a 'guerrilla librarian' Other guerrilla librarians include organizations such as Biologists Helping Bookstores, private citizen scientists re-shelving books to prevent pseudoscience from being placed in with the science categories. In comparison to the original 1997 usage of the term, this version of guerrilla librarianship involves the removal or rearrangement of books by the general public regarding bookstores as opposed to librarians in public library settings.

It is sometimes known as one of the so-called 'promotion laws', along with Nor√∞lleoda laga, and both these texts belong to a legal compilation on status, dubbed ‚Äòthe Ge√æync√∞u group‚Äô by the historian Patrick Wormald. Though the extent to which these reflect reality is a topic of some debate, they constitute one of the most valuable primary documents for an understanding of social status in late Anglo-Saxon England. The Ge√æync√∞u group: manuscripts and texts Taking the ‚ÄòGe√æync√∞u group‚Äô as a whole, Patrick Wormald distinguishes between two classes of manuscripts. The first originates in Worcester and consists of copies of texts in two of Wulfstan's autograph manuscripts: (1) Cambridge, CCC, MS 201 ('D'), which contains all five documents of the group: Ge√æync√∞o, Nor√∞leoda laga (‚ÄúNorth-people's law‚Äù), Mircna laga (‚ÄúMercian law‚Äù), A√∞ (‚ÄúOath‚Äù) and Hadbot (‚ÄúCompensation for the ordained‚Äù); and (2) Corpus 190 ('O'), which preserves only the last three.Wormald, Making of English law, p. 391. The second class was produced at a further remove from its original scriptorium. It is represented by two early 12th-century manuscript families: (a) the Textus Roffensis, a substantial collection of Old English law-texts with Latin translations, and (b) the various manuscripts of the Quadripartitus, which offer a vast array of legal texts in Latin translation only. On grounds of style and layout, Wormald argues that the second class of the Ge√æync√∞u group goes back to a common exemplar containing a southern redaction of material from Worcester. This material may have reached Rochester via Canterbury. Both Textus Roffensis and Quadripartitus contain versions of Ge√æync√∞u and Nor√∞leoda laga. As opposed to the law-codes issued by Anglo-Saxon kings, the five texts offer no official enactments, but they record what the author or compiler understood to have been church law and customary law in certain regions of England, such as Wessex, (West) Mercia, the Danelaw and Northumbria. The core of the group is made up by a number of texts on wergild. Authorship and date Since 1950, when Dorothy Bethurum's study on the five documents of the group was published,Bethurum, ‚ÄúSix anonymous Old English legal codes.‚Äù the composition of Ge√æync√∞u is usually attributed to Wulfstan (II), Archbishop of York between 1002 and 1023, who was also responsible for drafting official law-codes for kings √Üthelred and Cnut.Wormald, Making of English law, p. Wormald dates the text some time between 1008 and 1014, when the Sermo Lupi ad Anglos appears to have been written.Wormald, ‚ÄúArchbishop Wulfstan‚Äù, pp. 18-9. Contents The introductory statement strikes a nostalgic chord about a golden age in which society was stratified by law and custom: :‚ÄúOnce it used to be that people and rights went by dignities [ge√æync√∞o], and councillors of the people were then entitled to honour, each according to his rank, whether noble [eorl] or ceorl, retainer or lord.‚ÄùWhitelock, EHD I, p. 432. What follows may well be the most famous line of the text, which lists the requirements of wealth and service by which once a ceorl could rise to thegnhood: :\\"And if a ceorl prospered, that he possessed fully five hides of land of his ownUsually understood as bookland. a bell and a castle-gate, a seat and special office in the king's hall, then was he henceforth entitled to the rights of a thegn.\\"Whitelock, EHD I, p. 432. This line is cited in Latin in the Instituta Cnuti. The text goes on to distinguish between four different types of thegn and their qualifications: at the top stood the thegn who rode in the king's household band (hired) and had a 'median thegn' to serve him and to represent him in court with a preliminary oath (for-a√∞). A less privileged type is the king's thegn who was without any such representative. On the next level is the median thegn, who likewise held five hides of his own, but served a king's thegn, attended him in the king's hall and was qualified to represent him with an oath. Finally, there was also a lower type of median thegn, who did not (yet) meet these requirements of land and service. The southern redaction in the Textus Roffensis adds two further clauses. One is on the thegn who is promoted to earl (eorl) and acquires the rights of an earl, and the other on the merchant who becomes a thegn by virtue of having made three voyages at his own cost. The next clause proceeds with the ecclesiastical component to social promotion. In a general way, it asserts that the scholar who distinguished himself through learning and \\"took orders\\", was entitled to more honour and protection, provided that he remained chaste. The final clause suggests that cases of physical and verbal violence against ecclesiastics and strangers were at all times to be heard at the royal or episcopal court, whoever the suspect might be.

It was published in the November 2009 issue of The New Yorker magazine. The story is set in Castle Rock, King's famous fictitious city; in \\"Premium Harmony\\" the city is almost abandoned and run-down. Plot summary While en route to Wal- Mart for grass seed, Ray and Mary Burkett, with their dog Biznezz in the back seat, fight about the state of their lawn, his smoking, and her obesity. Mary demands they stop at a convenience store in order to purchase a purple kickball for their niece's birthday, and while in there she suffers a heart attack and immediately dies. Her husband Ray is fetched from the car by a store employee. The emergency medical technicians arrive, pronounce her dead, and remove her body. Ray remains with the store employees and customers, recounting Mary's County Fair awards for her quilting. After nearly two hours have passed, he returns to the car, where Biznezz has died from hyperthermia, with the remnants of a Sno Ball Ray had fed him earlier still in his whiskers. This causes in Ray a simultaneous welling-up of \\"great sadness\\" and \\"amusement\\". The story is written in third-person limited narrative and reveals a number of Ray's more egocentric thoughts throughout the story's events, such as being disturbed at the similarity between the manager's attempts at mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and French kissing, the thought that a bystander might give him a mercy fuck, and, as the story closes, the thought that he can now smoke whatever, whenever, and wherever he likes.

Looney Tunes animated short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on August 1, 1959, and stars Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam. Plot The short opens in the town of Canasta Flats in 1889 pulling past the Last Chance Saloon and the Next To The Last Chance Saloon and into the Fat Chance Saloon, where the patrons hang out. A mustached cowboy tells his friend that he hears that Yosemite Sam is in town, but his friend makes up an excuse about leaving a cake in the oven and flees. A card-playing cowboy tells his friend that Yosemite Sam is swinging his fastest gun of the West. Injun Joe tells them that Yosemite Sam has never met him (later to die in a shootout against the latter). Sam enters the saloon and states who he is, until he gets interrupted by a voice yelling \\"Ah, shaddap!\\" Sam comes up to the pink shirt cowboy who stayed and demands to know if he just told him to shut up. The cowboy reveals himself to be Bugs Bunny, who admits he indeed said it. When Sam tells Bugs that his backtalk has led him to a duel, Sam then warns Bugs he will get shot and that he is a sharp shooter but the latter however informs Sam he is one as well. To prove it, he tells Sam a shot that he is good at, and fires a bullet that ricochets off various objects before parting Sam's hair down the middle. After Sam sees the bullet come in, he ducks and tells Bugs that he missed, but when Bugs tells him to wait, Sam's hat falls off in half, revealing parted hair. Unimpressed at this skill of sharp shooting, Sam shows Bugs some real shooting by tossing a can in the air and shooting it full of holes. To top it, Bugs tosses the same can up, but shoots Sam in the face instead. When Sam threatens to blast Bugs for that \\"accident,\\" Bugs suggests that they settle things \\"in a gentleman-like manner\\", to which Sam agrees to, even though it is against his principles. They begin the typical ten-pace and fire, only with Bugs going the same way Sam does, when Sam cheats on the count of ten. Sam turns to fire, but fires directly past Bugs, who then kisses him on the nose. After Bugs does it again, Sam calls off the \\"Gentlemen's Duel\\" and forces Bugs to fight \\"dirty\\", so they each go to opposite ends of a bar shooting at each other. As Sam goes to one end, Bugs blasts him in the face, and when Sam tries to return, Bugs outruns and blasts him again. Unfortunately, their fight is interrupted when Sam hears a train whistle seeing that it's 5:15 and tells Bugs that he's cutting the gunfight short so that he can catch and rob the train. Just as Sam hops aboard his horse and rides off after the train, Bugs follows on another horse. Sam orders Bugs at gunpoint to go back so he can rob it, but Bugs vows that he's going to save it. Right after Bugs hops aboard the engine's cab of the train (switching his cowboy hat with a train engineer's cap), Sam orders Bugs back at the count of five. Just as Sam reaches four, his horse makes him hit a telegraph pole. When Sam catches up again and tries counting to three, but when he gets to two, he runs into the wall of a tunnel. He catches up again and tries just counting two, but when he reaches two, he and his horse fall off a trestle bridge and into a river below. Sam, however, rides on ahead of Bugs and boards another locomotive to hit Bugs' green-painted 4-4-0 American type steam engine with a tender (#791). Thinking this will make Bugs stop, Sam calls out to Bugs to stop his train because he's got one of his own (a tender- less 4-2-0 red locomotive, #99), but Bugs calls out to Sam to stop his train. Both openly state that neither will stop their train unless the other stops his first. Thinking Bugs wants to play dirty, Sam tells Bugs they'll see who stops their train first when they crash and advances the regulator in his locomotive. Bugs accepts this duel and advances the regulator on his engine as well. As both trains rush towards each other head on, Sam keeps a stern face while Bugs remains calm. Almost to collision, Sam considers blowing his locomotive's whistle, but instead ducks down to wait for the crash. Bugs, however, extends the \\"legs\\" on the cars of his train so that Sam's passes harmlessly underneath. Just as Sam gets up and wonders why there was no crash, he spots a sign reading \\"End of Line\\" and his train falls off an unfinished trestle bridge and into a lake below. Bugs, in his engine's cab, then calls out a goodbye to Sam and drives off to St. Louis. The final shot shows Sam's locomotive, up to its smokestack in the lake. With his enemy vanquished, Bugs yells \\"So long, screwy, see ya in Saint Louie!\\" Sam pokes out of the smokestack, blackened with soot, watching Bugs already in the distance, and openly admits to the audience: \\"I hate that rabbit!\\"Internet Archive See also *List of American films of 1959 *Hare Trigger‚Äîthe debut of Yosemite Sam *Bugs Bunny Rides Again‚Äîanother Bugs-Sam collaboration External links * * References Category:1959 films Category:1959 animated films Category:1959 short films Category:1950s American animated films Category:1950s animated short films Category:1950s Western (genre) comedy films Category:Films set in 1889 Category:Looney Tunes shorts Category:American films Category:Animated films about trains Category:Short films directed by Friz Freleng Category:American Western (genre) comedy films Category:Films scored by Milt Franklyn Category:Animated western (genre) animation Category:Films featuring Bugs Bunny Category:1959 comedy films ","title":"Wild and Woolly Hare"},{"id":"24938595","text":"William Edmund Smyth (1858‚Äì1950) was an Anglican bishop in the last decade of the nineteenth century and the first two of the twentieth.‚ÄúWho was Who‚Äù 1897-1990 London, A & C Black, 1991 Ecclesiastical Intelligence The Times Wednesday, Oct 19, 1892; pg. 5; Issue 33773; col F Biography He was educated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge.

It received high praise from critics for its storyline and many cultural references, in addition to receiving some criticism from PETA. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 8.48 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Chris Matthews, Nathan Gunn, Eddie Sotelo, Fred Tatasciore and Kel MacFarlane, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \\"Dog Gone\\" was released on DVD along with seven other episodes from the season on June 15, 2010. Plot After much anticipation, Brian receives an invitation to an award ceremony celebrating his novel, Faster Than the Speed of Love, by the Rhode Island Society for Special Literary Excellence. Convinced he is a great writer, Brian attempts to gain the family's interest but fails to do so. Once he arrives at the \\"award ceremony\\" however, he discovers that he has misunderstood the meaning of the word \\"special\\", prompting him to drown his sorrows at the local bar and realize that he is not a writer, but a joke. He drives home drunk that night and accidentally runs over and kills a dog. He secretly buries the dead dog's body outside the Griffins' home and tries to keep quiet about it. Stewie, having witnessed his deed, begins to toy with Brian's guilt, eventually driving him to a state where he decides to confess to \\"murder\\". However, when he confesses to Joe and the Griffin family, they all laugh, saying that no one cares if a dog or any other animal is killed, especially by another animal. Outraged, Brian starts a support group, and decides to call it \\"The Quahog Animal Equal Rights League\\", to convince the town that the lives of animals should be of equal value to humans'. As the town citizens learn more about it, however, none of them are keen on changing their lifestyles if it means no processed meats and medical research on animals, and even become interested in how dogs taste after Brian mentions they are eaten in some cultures. Refusing to listen any further, they chase after Brian in an attempt to eat him. Brian realizes that if no one cares about the lives of animals, then he is worthless to the Griffin family and everyone else. Stewie finds Brian crying in the bathtub, and, seeing how upset Brian is and feeling sorry for him, Stewie successfully fakes his death by putting his collar (which Brian hadn't been wearing) on a stray and killing it in a liquor store fire. The Griffins are devastated upon learning about Brian's supposed death, and realize how close a friend he was to them. Seeing this, Stewie rushes upstairs to show Brian how much the Griffins still care about him, regardless of his species. Brian then realizes his life does have a purpose and thanks Stewie for helping him, and decides to remain hidden to let the Griffins grieve a little longer. Meanwhile, Quagmire accidentally knocks over a carton of Kool-Aid mix on the kitchen floor of the Griffin's house and leaves Peter to take the blame. Frustrated with having to clean Peter's messes, Lois hires a Hispanic maid named Consuela to clean their house. But Consuela quickly proves to be very stubborn, refusing to leave after her work hours and sleeping at the Griffins' house overnight, much to Peter and Lois' annoyance. They try to fire her and even bribe her to leave, but she still refuses (though she takes the money they offer her anyway). In a last-ditch attempt, Peter finally gets rid of her by tricking her into inhaling chloroform on a handkerchief, and leaves her in a basket on Joe's front porch. At the end, Peter lets the viewers know that everyone at Family Guy respects all living beings and assures the viewers that no animals were harmed in the making of the episode, but they were going hurt the feelings of an Italian opera singer by prematurely dropping the curtain on his performance - this is then shown onscreen. Production and development Steve Callaghan wrote the episode. First announced at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International in San Diego, California on July 25, 2009, by future showrunner Steve Callaghan, the episode was directed by series regular, and former King of the Hill and The Oblongs director, Julius Wu, and written by Callaghan before the conclusion of the eighth production season. The episode saw the reintroduction of the recurring character Consuela, a Hispanic maid whose first appearance was in the sixth season episode \\"Believe It or Not, Joe's Walking on Air\\". The character is voiced by main cast member Mike Henry. \\"Dog Gone\\", along with seven other episodes from Family Guys eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on June 15, 2010. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Seth MacFarlane and various crew and cast members for several episodes, a collection of deleted scenes, a special mini-feature which discussed the process behind animating \\"Road to the Multiverse\\", and a mini-feature entitled Family Guy Karaoke. In addition to the regular cast, anchor and political commentator Chris Matthews, voice actor Fred Tatasciore, opera singer Nathan Gunn, radio personality Eddie Sotelo and Kel MacFarlane, webmaster of the Seth MacFarlane fan site, guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Ralph Garman, writer John Viener, writer Mark Hentemann, actress Alexandra Breckenridge, writer Alec Sulkin and writer Danny Smith also made minor appearances. Cultural references In the opening scene of the episode, Stewie is seen going through Brian's internet history, which includes searches about himself on the internet search engine Google. Later, after going to the bar to drink, Brian talks to Bill, the father from The Family Circus syndicated comic strip. After Bill tells him he should have tried harder on writing his book, Brian responds by yelling that all Bill does is \\"judge\\" other people, and demands for him to go home and \\"fuck [his] wife in the face\\", to which Bill agrees. This is also later recognized by Peter the next day, when he is seen reading the funnies, and murmurs to himself, \\"this is a very shocking Family Circus.\\" News anchor Chris Matthews made his first guest appearance in the series. News anchor and political commentator Chris Matthews' show entitled Hardball with Chris Matthews is referenced by Stewie when he suggests Brian is getting a big head, with the guest, United States Senator Harry Reid, then appearing on Matthews' forehead, suggesting Matthews is self-centered. After Reid continues to interrupt him, however, Matthews cuts to actor Kurtwood Smith, in which Matthews appears on Smith's forehead instead. Once Consuela is hired as the family maid, she first begins to annoy Peter by listening to stereotypical Latin music played loudly on a portable radio, in which the singer repeats the Spanish phrase \\"¬°Muchos horn-os!\\" which literally translates to \\"many ovens\\" but within the context of the show is actually meant to be Spanglish for \\"many horns.\\" In Consuela's final appearance in the episode, she is seen watching a commercial, which parodies local commercials urging viewers to hire a lawyer if they are in a car accident. In an attempt to try to prove that an animal has the same rights as humans, Brian starts an advocacy group, and is suggested by Lois to join PETA, but she is unable to enunciate the word differently from how she pronounces \\"Peter,\\" leading her husband to become confused. The end of the gag has Chris stating his belief that Betty White is a member of the organization, with his wording prompting Peter to yell, \\"That doesn't even make sense!\\" Brian goes on to create a public service announcement regarding animal rights, one of which involves a dog being \\"tortured\\" by having to listen to the radio show All Things Considered on National Public Radio, which the dog's owner leaves on for him before leaving the house. Reception In an improvement over the previous four episodes, the episode was viewed in 8.48 million homes in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings, despite airing simultaneously with Sunday Night Football, the television movie A Dog Named Christmas on CBS and Desperate Housewives on ABC. The episode also acquired a 4.4 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, beating The Simpsons, The Cleveland Show and American Dad!, but was ultimately edged out slightly by The Simpsons in total viewership. Reviews of the episode were highly positive, citing the Brian and Stewie storyline as a \\"solid attempt to tell a good story,\\" and the Consuela scenes as \\"terrific.\\" Ahsan Haque of IGN also noted that \\"the writers deserved some credit\\" for the episode, saying that, in comparison to past episodes the episode did not \\"come across as a haphazardly assembled string of jokes.\\" Jason Hughes of TV Squad also found the Consuela scenes to be \\"hilarious,\\" but found the final scene to be \\"strangely uncomfortable,\\" expecting Meg to be pushed out of the family hug. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club praised the handling of Brian's character in the episode, and called the Peter and PETA gag \\"pretty cheap, but quite funny,\\" giving the episode a B rating overall. In February 2010, for \\"rais[ing] public awareness of animal issues\\", \\"Dog Gone\\" won a Genesis Award for television comedy, winning over South Park episode 'Whale Whores\\" and Monk episode \\"Mr. Monk and the Dog\\". In a post on PETA's official blog, Amanda Schinke, however, was highly critical of the episode for its \\"myriad of violent deaths of cartoon dogs.\\" In addition, she called for the show to \\"hire who can generate material that doesn't make us roll our eyes.\\" References External links * * Category:2009 American television episodes Category:Family Guy (season 8) episodes Category:Fiction about animal cruelty Category:Animal rights ","title":"Dog Gone"},{"id":"24938636","text":"Marcos G√≥mez Llunas (born 29 September 1971, Madrid) better known as Marcos Llunas is a Spanish singer-songwriter, known in Spain and Latin America.

The SS- Hauptscharf√ºhrer, who held the rank of Quartermaster Sergeant, is said to have personally killed thousands of innocent victims (over 20 thousand according to some reports) during his time at Birkenau. Early life Moll was born in Hohen Sch√∂nberg, Germany, on 4 March 1915. He trained as a gardener before joining the SS on 1 May 1935 (serial number 277670). SS career Moll joined the SS-Totenkopfverb√§nde, the SS Death's Head Units responsible for administering the Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps for Nazi Germany. One of his earliest jobs was a Kommandof√ºhrer in charge of a camp's gardeners' work detail. In May 1941, Otto Moll was transferred from the Sachsenhausen concentration camp to Auschwitz where he was put in charge of digging the mass graves. Over the next three and half years, Moll served in several staff roles at the camp. He soon became the director of employment services at the men's camp in Auschwitz II. In 1944, Moll oversaw all the crematoria in Birkenau. He also was a Lagerf√ºhrer of the F√ºrstengrube subcamp in Wesola and the Gleiwitz I sub-camp. According to Auschwitz Kommandant Rudolf H√∂ss, he and Moll were both decorated by Adolf Hitler with the War Merit Cross, First Class with Swords. He appears several times in the photo album belonging to Auschwitz commandant Karl-Friedrich H√∂cker that showed SS camp staff on leave at a retreat. Moll would say to his personnel: \\"Befehl ist Befehl!\\" (\\"An order is an order!\\") to justify his actions. An attitude that other defendants at the Nuremberg Trials also cited as a defence.. Brutality Alter Feinsilber, a member of the Sonderkommando at Birkenau who worked for Moll, said at his war crimes trial: > It happened that some prisoners offered resistance when about to be shot at > the pit or that children would cry and then SS Quartermaster Sergeant Moll > would throw them alive into the flames of the pit. Another Sonderkommando prisoner named Henryk Tauber testified: > Hauptscharf√ºhrer Moll was the most degenerate of the lot. Before his arrival > at the camp, he was in charge of the work at the Bunkers, where they > incinerated the gassed victims in pits. Then he was transferred for a while > to another section. In view of the preparation necessary for the \\"reception\\" > of convoys from Hungary in 1944, he was put in charge of all the crematoria. > It is he who organized the large-scale extermination of the people arriving > in these convoys. Just before the arrival of the Hungarian transports, he > ordered pits to be dug alongside crematoria V and restarted the activity of > Bunker 2, which had been lying idle, and its pits. In the yard of the > crematory, there were notices on posts, with inscriptions telling the new > arrivals from the transports that they were to go to the camp where work was > waiting for them, but that first they had to take a bath and undergo > disinfestation. For that, it was necessary for them to undress and put all > their valuables in baskets specially placed for this purpose in the yard. > Moll repeated the same thing in his speeches to the new arrivals. There were > so many convoys that sometimes it happened that the gas chambers were > incapable of containing all the new arrivals. The excess people were > generally shot, one at a time and often by Moll himself. On several > occasions, Moll threw people into the flaming pits alive. He also practised > shooting people from a distance. He ill-treated and beat Sonderkommando > prisoners, treating them like animals. Those who were in his personal > service told us that he used a piece of wire to fish out gold objects from > the box containing the jewels taken from new arrivals, and took them off in > a briefcase. Among the objects left by the people who came to be gassed, he > took furs and different types of food, in particular fat. When he took food, > he said smilingly to the SS around him that one had to take advantage before > the lean years came. Under his direction, the Sonderkommando was > strengthened and increased to about 1000 prisoners. Arrest and execution After Auschwitz-Birkenau was abandoned by the SS on 18 January 1945, Moll was transferred to a sub-camp of Dachau concentration camp. On 28 April 1945, a day before the Dachau camp was liberated by American troops, Moll arrived at the main camp with a group of prisoners he had forced on a death march. The next day he was captured and arrested. In November 1945, Moll was put on trial by an American Military Tribunal during the Dachau trials. Although the trial heard testimony from victims of The Holocaust about his brutality, Moll was only charged with one count of forcing prisoners on a death march in April 1945. He was found guilty and executed by hanging at Landsberg am Lech prison on 28 May 1946.

It is used to draw, or make selections by tapping. While devices with touchscreens such as newer computers, mobile devices (smartphones and personal digital assistants), game consoles, and graphics tablets can usually be operated with a fingertip, a stylus provides more accurate and controllable input. The stylus has the same function as a mouse or trackpad as a pointing device; its use is commonly called pen computing.  History  The first use of a stylus in a computing device was the Styalator, demonstrated by Tom Dimond in 1957.  Types of styluses  Different types of stylus are used for graphics tablets, and resistive and capacitive touchscreens. Capacitive screens are very widely used on smart phones and multi-touch surfaces, where simultaneous use of several fingers is detected; a stylus cannot replicate this.  Capacitive stylus  Capacitive (also called passive) styluses emulate a finger by using a tip made of rubber or conductive foam; or metal such as copper. They do not need to be powered and can be used on any multi-touch surface that a finger can be used, typically capacitive screens that are common in smart phones and tablet computers. Stylus tips made of rubber or foam are often large so it's difficult to get precise notes or drawings. Capacitive styluses work by distorting the screen‚Äôs electrostatic field. Screens that receive input from a capacitive stylus (as well as human fingers) can't register pressure applied by the pen; tilting of the pen; and can't distinguish between a capacitive stylus, your finger, or a resting palm as input - it will register all of these touches as marks on the screen. = Construction = Capacitive styluses are made of a conductive material (typically as a metal rod or barrel) to transmit electrical charge between your hand and a rubber/foam or metal tip such as copper. Being free of any digital components, capacitive styluses can be cost effective to manufacture. DIY capacitive styluses can also be made with materials found at home. = Compatibility with devices = Capacitive styluses tend to work on any multi-touch surface that accepts input from a finger.  Active stylus  See also Active pen, Digital pen Active (also called digital) styluses include digital components or circuitry inside the pen that communicates with a digitizer on the touch device. This communication allows for advanced features like pressure sensitivity; tilt; programmable buttons; palm detection; eraser tips; memorizing settings and writing data transmission. In order for an active stylus to function, its digital component protocol must match the digitizer technology in the touch screen it is interacting with. Active styluses are powered by a removable or chargeable battery, or operate passively by inductance. = Compatibility with devices = Active styluses use different protocols by different manufacturers in order to communicate with the digitizer of a graphic tablet or multi-touch device. The digital protocol of the pen must match the device digitizer, otherwise input from the pen will not register on the device. These types of active stylus protocols available are: *Microsoft Pen Protocol (MPP) (formerly N-trig) * Wacom AES 1.0 and 2.0 * Wacom EMR *Univeral Stylus Initiative (USI) * Apple Pencil Active Projected Capacitive (APC) *Bluetooth = Examples of active styluses = * Microsoft Surface Pen * Samsung S-Pen * Google Pixelbook Pen * Apple Pencil  Stylus performance  A stylus' performance is measured by these four characteristics: # Comfort # Resistance # Balance and weight # Precision: ## Responsiveness & speed ## Jitter ## Tilt ## Levels of pressure ## Palm rejection or detection, which prevents a touch device from registering or marking the screen when a hand or palm is resting on the screen surface, relies on a combination of technology in the stylus, the OS software and the screen digitizer technology, to work effectively.

Citizens came to know him simply as the Old Man Bukashkin (), the person in line somewhat of a skomorokh street-performer tradition. He himself humorously styled his title as \\"the People's Street sweeper of Russia\\", mocking the official People's Artist title bestowed by the State.  Biography  Most of his life Evgeny had spent in Yekaterinburg. He graduated with a diploma in power engineering and worked as a power station supervisor. By and by his attention turned to art: he tried to bring the \\"modern people's culture\\" to the spotlight, painting pictures over concrete fences of the city, over garbage containers. At some point special areas on existing concrete fences, both permanent and temporary, were granted for use, and this tradition exists in Yekaterinburg to this day. After some time, he gained fame as the most extravagant city's artist. He also authored short verses and prose and did some traditional art painting. At some moment he was taken up by the idea of posters against drunkenness. The increasing fame brought publishing offers from magazines and newspapers. Along with his friends he started a non- governmental art society \\"Kartinnik\\" (from - a painting). In 1990-1992 he made the whole city surface his canvas, leaving his paintings here and there - on a garage wall, on a concrete fence. These works of art are now lost. Annual posthumous exhibitions of Old Man Bukashkin's art are run in Yekaterinburg. Ural State University's culturology and art faculty has a small exhibition devoted to him. In 2007-2008 some tramway cars were decorated with the old works of the members of \\"Kartinnik\\" society.

Plot The film begins with three men in an art gallery, where one of the men is explaining his performance art exhibition to the other two. The three men are attacked by a monstrous figure. A woman walks with a monk in a forest and talks to him about her concern for her son after a disturbing dream. A young woman named Poon is swimming laps at a pool when a mysterious figure appears to her. After showering, Poon again sees mysterious figures, who turn out to be her friends and her boyfriend Nat playing a trick on her. They convince her to go to a club with them even though she doesn't want to. After they leave the club, Poon convinces Nat to visit his mother. Nat doesn't want to, but they go visit anyway. His mother is the woman who was speaking to the monk about her son, and it is obvious that she does not approve of Poon. Nat's mother asks him to visit the temples, to which he begrudgingly agrees. After Nat and Poon pay their respects at the first temple, Nat meets a novice monk in the forest. He soon realizes that the monk is Sujitto, an old friend of his. Sujitto joins Nat and Poon on their journey. The three continue on their road trip to another temple, where Nat and Sujitto experience very disturbing visions. They continue on their journey; on the way to the fifth temple the car's windshield is broken by three troublemakers on motorbikes. Nat chases them but they get away. Nat and Poon drop the monk off at a temple, then take the car back to the mechanic in town for repairs. At a small bar, Nat and Poon have a disagreement. She goes outside to smoke a cigarette, where a ghostly figure is watching her from the balcony above her. Poon returns to the bar and continues the argument with Nat. There's a blackout, and Poon falls. Nat carries her upstairs to the bedroom. Nat and Poon start to get intimate, while the figure of a ghostly child watches them. The next morning they go to a cafe, but Poon vomits on the street. Nat asks if she's pregnant, but she dodges the question. They go to pick up Sujitto, who has agreed to attend a funeral for a family. Nat and Poon transport Sujitto and two other monks to the funeral, which takes them into the night. Nat thinks he sees the young man who damaged his windshield and pursues him into an old fishery, where he falls into the water and is overrun by eels. He disappears into the water. Poon finds Nat in the temple at the funeral, bleeding from the head. Nat realizes that the funeral was for the boy he was chasing. They leave the temple with Poon driving. Poon hits a calf in the road, and sees the mother standing on the side of the road watching. Poon gets very upset, and they attempt to take the calf to get help. The man they've found to help slaughters the calf instead, saying it was too late and that he wanted to keep the animal from suffering. They continue on to the next temple, where Poon is trying to make spiritual amends for killing the cow. She is attacked by a deformed, decomposed child-sized demon-like figure, who shows her disturbing images of a young boy with burns on half his face being abused by his mother. She wakes up and asks Sujitto what is happening; he tells her that Karma is mysterious and beyond reason. She and Nat get into a physical confrontation and Poon slaps Nat, who leaves her and Sujitto behind. Nat decides to track down Poon and Sujitto, and they continue on to the next temple when they hit something else in the road. Poon wanders off and is attacked again. This time it is revealed that she is reliving the abuse and death of the young, burned boy she saw in her vision back at the previous temple. Poon believes that she is seeing images of her past life.She reveals to Nat that she's pregnant and was considering an abortion, which she thinks is the same thing that her \\"mother' did to her in her previous life. The trio make it to the final temple, where Nat and Poon say goodbye to Sujitto, but Poon realizes that she is in the location of her vision, the place where the boy killed his father by knocking him off a roof, and his mother dragged him by a chain into the woods. She and Nat find the shack where the boy was left to die after his mother's suicide. Nat's mother arrives, and reveals that Nat is not her only son. Sujitto is also there, and he is revealed to be Nat's twin. Nat's mother left him at a monastery when he was an infant in order to try to cheat Karma. Sujitto realizes that he can not escape Karma, and Poon realizes that he's standing on a well. The well collapses, and Sujitto falls into the well, an expression of perfect peace on his face. Nat, Poon, and Nat's mother leave the temple. Nat gives his mother a present he'd been holding for a long time, and they continue the drive home.

He remained in the Royal Air Force post-war, and served throughout World War II before retiring in 1948. Biography Early life and background Franklyn was born in the Heathfield area of Twickenham, Middlesex, the son of Burdett Caslon Franklyn, a butcher's clerk from Melbourne, Australia, and his wife Violet, who was born in Brighton, Sussex. His father died when Franklyn was 15, and his elder brother, Vere, died at the age of four. World War I Franklyn entered the Royal Flying Corps as a cadet, and was commissioned as a probationary temporary second lieutenant on 12 August 1917, being confirmed in his rank on 12 November. In early 1918 he was posted to No. 3 Squadron RFC, gaining his first victory on 22 March, flying a Sopwith Camel, by destroying an Albatros D.V southeast of Havrincourt. By the time of his second victory on 11 April, over Ervillers, which he shared with Captain Douglas John Bell, Lieutenant C. E. Mayer and Lieutenant Lloyd Andrews Hamilton, the Army's Royal Flying Corps had merged with the Navy's Royal Naval Air Service to form the Royal Air Force, so it was with No. 3 Squadron RAF that Franklyn was credited with this and all his subsequent wins. His third victory came the next day, on 12 April, driving an Albatros D.V down out of control over Pozi√®res. On 20 April 1918, Franklyn became the last British pilot to engage the \\"Red Baron\\" Manfred von Richthofen in aerial combat. Von Richthofen's squadron of more than 18 aircraft spotted six Sopwith Camels below them and dove to attack. However six more Camels, including Franklyn, then arrived and broke up the German attack, with Franklyn forcing von Richthofen down to the cover of the German ground forces. The following day, von Richthofen was killed by ground fire, having avoided contact with Canadian ace Arthur Roy Brown, but strayed over the Allied lines. It was 9 June before Franklyn scored again, when he and Lieutenant Will Hubbard destroyed an Albatros C.

On one occasion he silenced an enemy battery which had been most active, and on the following day shot down a hostile plane, which finally crashed to earth. He has on numerous occasions successfully attacked enemy aircraft on the ground, and by accurate bombing and machine-gun fire has inflicted heavy casualties on personnel and a very considerable amount of damage to materiel. His skill and gallantry have been of the highest order. On 20 July Franklyn and Captain Hazel Wallace drove down a Hannover C over Ayette, making Franklyn an ace.

Travian Games also acts as an international publisher for selected game titles. Since 2017, the largest company in the video game industry in Bavaria has been a member of the BIU ‚Äì Bundesverband Interaktive Unterhaltungssoftware (Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software). Moreover, Lars Janssen, CEO of Travian Games, has been serving as a board member of Game ‚Äì the Association of the German Games Industry since 2018.  History  In 2003, company founder Gerhard M√ºller and his team developed the first version of the strategy browser game Travian. The free-to- play game was released in the summer of the following year and renamed to Travian: Legends in 2015. The game remains one of the world's most successful browser games to this day. Travian Games GbR was established in Munich at the beginning of 2005. In the fall of the same year, it changed to its current form: Travian Games GmbH. The original staff of four employees, including the founder's brother, Siegfried M√ºller, and his former school friend, Holger Miller, grew within just a few years to its current size of more than 190 employees. This expansion resulted in Travian Games GmbH becoming the largest employer in the games industry in Bavaria. In 2006, their flagship game Travian already reached a million players. Due to the increasing number of employees and the focus on new developments, the company relocated to a larger office complex within Munich in 2008 and 2009. In 2010, the company joined the Hamburg developer studio Northworks which, with the support of the City of Hamburg's prototype sponsorship, had until then been able to launch two browser games on the market, including goalunited. In the following year, Travian Games GmbH was awarded the Prize for the Best German Publisher by GameStar. Moreover, Travian Games acquired the majority stake in the Cologne developer studio Bright Future in 2012. The company had already successfully worked with the studio two years previously to develop the magical garden simulation game Miramagia followed by the MMO browser game Rail Nation in 2013. Bright Future also worked with Electronic Arts on the successful PC game series FIFA Manager. To mark the 10-year anniversary of the flagship game, Travian, which continues to be offered as Travian: Legends, the new browser game Travian Kingdoms was developed under the direction of company founder Gerhard M√ºller. The online racing game UnitedGP was also launched on the market in 2014. Since the change in management in 2015, the company has been placing greater focus on developing and marketing PC games with strong multi- player elements, which aim to provide a community-driven gaming experience. The strategic direction of the games developer shifted with the new managing director, Lars Janssen. Travian Games has since concentrated on its core business, developing its own browser games, but it has also expanded its international portfolio. The Bavarian games developer also became a third- party publisher for the massively multi-player online role-playing game Crowfall (ArtCraft Entertainment) in 2016, and for the massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) Shroud of the Avatar (Portalarium) in 2017. Travian Games became a member of the BIU (Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software) on 1 April 2017. The BIU (Bundesverband Interaktive Unterhaltungssoftware e.V.) is the representative organization of the German computer and video game industry and also a sponsor of gamescom.

Thus, in both Spain and Spanish America, this principle was a predecessor to the concept of popular sovereignty, currently expressed in most constitutional systems throughout the world, whereby the people delegate governmental functions in their leaders while retaining the actual sovereignty.  Historical development  Juntas in Spanish America. In 1808, the Spanish King Ferdinand VII had been imprisoned by the Napoleonic Empire and subsequently replaced by Joseph Bonaparte. The Seven-Part Code recognized the right of \\"good and honest\\" persons to form Juntas in absence of the king.Ciudadan√≠a y representaci√≥n en el Per√∫ (1808-1860).Gabriella Chiaramonti.2005 El c√≥digo medieval de las Siete Partidas reconoc√≠a expresamente el derecho de los nobles, prelados, hombres de fortuna y otras personas ¬´buenas y honradas¬ª del reino a constituirse en juntas cuando, en ausencia del rey In Spain, resistant governing juntas were formed, claiming sovereignty in the absence of the legitimate King. Following the 1810 disbanding of the central governing Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom, Spanish American peoples assumed, in turn, their right to appoint new local authorities, and recovered the tradition of the open cabildos. But the Seven-Part Code implied that the territory was still under the sovereignty of the King and that the Juntas were only a temporary fix. The principle of retroversion of sovereignty added the twist that, in such a case, sovereignty would return to the peoples, who would have a right to reject the authority of the king and appoint new authorities. The principle of retroversion of sovereignty was premised on the basis that the Spanish territories in America were a personal possession of the king of Spain, and not a colony of Spain. Only the king could rule over them, either directly or through viceroys appointed by himself. This principle already existed, and justified the fact that Spain and Spanish America had different laws. Scholars of the Laws of the Indies had argued that they were two different realms, united under one same crown.Luna, F√©lix (March 2001). ¬´La f√≥rmula de la Revoluci√≥n¬ª, Grandes protagonistas de la historia argentina: Juan Jos√© Castelli (in spanish). Buenos Aires: Editorial Planeta, pp. 51. . With the Abdications of Bayonne and imprisonment of Ferdinand VII by Napoleon during the Peninsular war and the absence of a legitimate successor, the criterion was used to justify self- government in Spain. But the Junta of Seville had no authority to send or appoint viceroys in America, and Americans had instead the same rights as Spaniards to govern themselves as the rightful king was absent. The principle was employed by many independentist movements in South America of that time, such as the Chuquisaca Revolution or the May Revolution. The American new entities also adopted the principle of consentimiento (of consent). This meant that they felt free to reject any decision they had been taken without their consent.Fundamentos intelectuales y pol√≠ticos de las independencias. Jos√© Carlos Chiaramonte 2010 En el caso hispanoamericano, ante la pretensi√≥n de lograr el reconocimineto de la metr√≥polis como autoridad sustituta del monarca, los criollos alegaban que su v√≠nculo pol√≠tico era con la monarqu√≠a castellana y no con la naci√≥n espa√±ola, y que, vacante el trono reasum√≠an la soberan√≠a.[...] Las nuevas entidades soberanas que se consideraban herederas de la soberan√≠a de la corona castellana [...] los considerados organismos soberanos representativos de las ciudades y luego provincias o Estados iberoamericanos rechazaron decisiones tomadas sin su consentimiento.

He took additional studies during summer schools at Cornell University and the University of Chicago, 1898-1900. During 1905‚Äì1908, he was an associate professor of education at IU, then a professor of secondary education there from 1908 until 1911. He pursued graduate study at Teachers' College, Columbia University, during 1908‚Äì1910. He earned his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1912, the year his dissertation, \\"The Pennsylvania state normal schools and public school system\\", was published. The Pennsylvania state normal schools and public school system, Columbia University, 1912. In 1911, Holland became superintendent of schools at Louisville, Kentucky, a position he held until 1915 when the Board of Regents selected him to be the fourth president of the State College of Washington, now called Washington State University. He succeeded Enoch A. Bryan who retired. Journal of educational psychology, Volume 6, 1915, by American Psychological Association References External links * Ernest O.

The Gulf Trough, also known as the Suwanee Straits, is an ancient geologic feature of Florida present during the Paleogene period, a period of roughly that started after the end of the Mesozoic Era (65.5 Mya). A strong marine current, similar to the Gulf Stream, scoured the trough from southwest to northeast. History During the Paleogene, what would become Florida was the submerged Florida Platform, a feature not unlike the Bahama Banks composed of carbonate sediments containing foraminifera, corals, bryozoa, and mollusks. Due to the current running through the Gulf Trough, materials needed for sedimentation were instead carried away toward the northeast. During the Eocene through Oligocene, a period of roughly , material born of erosion began building up more rapidly in the Gulf Trough, due to the uplifting of the Appalachian Mountains to the north, which provided the primary source of siliciclastic material transported south via rivers and streams. By the Early Miocene, considered the start of the Neogene, the trough was filled, and materials continued to move southward covering and replacing the carbonate-depositing marine environment with sands, silts, and clays; these sediments created the peninsula on which terrestrial flora and fauna could become established.Florida Environments Online, Florida's geological history and geological resources, ISSN 0085-0640 References *Burnett, William C., Cook, P.

Books Although little was known about chemical chirality in the time of Lewis Carroll, his work Through the Looking-glass contains a prescient reference to the differing biological activities of enantiomeric drugs: \\"Perhaps Looking- glass milk isn't good to drink,\\" Alice said to her cat. A supplemental story to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen made reference to this, mentioning in passing that after her return from the mirror world, her body was mirror- flipped, presumably down to the molecular level, as she was unable to digest food afterwards. In Arthur C. Clarke's short story \\"Technical Error\\" (also titled \\"The Reversed Man\\"), a technician working on a giant superconducting generator is accidentally \\"inverted\\" into his mirror image, right down to the coins in his pocket. When he is found to be starving despite an apparently- healthy diet, the culprit is determined to be the amino acids in his food, which are natural amino acids and opposite in chirality to those his body now requires. Isaac Asimov's short story \\"Left to Right\\" concerns an unknown \\"change in parity\\", and mentions biological incompatibilities due to chirality as one possible consequence. In one of George O. Smith's Venus Equilateral stories, an experimental teleporter that has killed several teleported animals is discovered to have inverted their chemical chirality; in the climax, two newborn babies are successfully teleported to a hospital on Earth through the simple measure of teleporting them twice, cancelling out the inversion. In Dorothy L. Sayers's novel The Documents in the Case, a murder is committed that is designed to appear as accidental death from eating poisonous mushrooms containing muscarine. The case is proved to be murder because the muscarine found in the deceased's stomach is racemic and therefore synthetic. In James Blish's Star Trek novella Spock Must Die!, Spock's mirror-duplicate is later discovered to have stolen chemical reagents from the medical bay to convert certain amino acids to opposite-chirality isomers that his metabolism requires. In Spider Robinson's Callahan's Place short story \\"Mirror/rorriM On the Wall\\", a mirror is constructed of thiotimoline which leads to a parallel but inverted universe. A character attempts to smuggle food between the two universes to sell as a diet product, since the amino acids are reversed and provide no caloric value. In Larry Niven's Destiny's Road, the title planet's indigenous life is based upon right-handed proteins. When human colonists arrive from Earth via a generation ship, extreme measures are taken to permit the colony's survival. A peninsula is sterilized with a lander's fusion drive, creating the titular \\"road\\" out of fused bedrock. The area is then reseeded with Earth life to provide the colonists with food. Though the soil lacks potassium due to other factors, necessitating supplements that produce a hydraulic empire common to Niven's fiction, the colony otherwise prospers. Native viruses and bacteria cannot infect colonists, resulting in longer lifespans. Sealife quickly recovers, and is consumed by the colonists as a \\"diet\\" food, as their digestive systems cannot metabolize it into fat. Marti Steussy's Dreams of Dawn (1988) has a similar premise, where the locals evolved based on right-handed amino acids. The denouement of Poul Anderson's After Doomsday relies partly on chirality. The plot of Roger Zelazny's Doorways in the Sand centers around a device called the Rhennius Machine, which reverses objects that pass through it, down to the atomic level. It is mentioned that an earlier version of the machine destroyed itself by reversing matter to antimatter. Daniel Suarez's novel Change Agent includes a character \\"the Mirror man\\" who is immune to neurotoxins due to his mirrored chirality. In Damon Knight's A For Anything, Leroy Platt uses a matter duplicator to make food; \\"Eating the food, too: Why not? Just put it through twice, make sure you don't get any reversed peptide chains.\\" In Stanislaw Lem's The Star Diaries, The Eight Voyage, fictional space traveller Ijon Tichy finds out, that the life on Earth emerged by accident, from the rotten food that two irresponsible starship pilots disposed on Earth' bare and then-lifeless surface. They stirred the waste using coal shovel and poker both twisted to the left, which is the reason, why all life on Earth has evolved to have left-handed amino acids. Computer games In the Trauma Center series of games, doctors test for a \\"chiral reaction\\" in order to determine whether or not a patient is infected with \\"Gangliated Utrophin Immuno Latency Toxin,\\" a fictional, parasitic pathogen more commonly referred to as GUILT. A positive reaction means the patient is infected, while a negative reaction means the patient has either been cured or is not infected. In the video game Mass Effect, the turian and quarian alien species have biology based upon right-handed amino acids. Because of this, foods from other species which have life forms based upon left-handed amino acids have no nutritional value and may cause fatal allergic reactions. The process works both ways‚Äîspecies based on left-handed acids, such as humans, cannot consume food from the turian or quarian homeworlds. Left-handed amino acids are portrayed as being more common than right-handed versions. The chirality difference is colloquially referred to as \\"Levo\\" and \\"Dextro\\" by characters in the game. The video game \\"Death Stranding\\" heavily uses the concept of chirality with a \\"chiral network\\" that is used for communication and transportation, as well as \\"chiral printers\\" that can replicate any object and biological material from incomplete samples. Television The television series Breaking Bad features the \\"Heisenberg\\" method of methamphetamine manufacture, which produces a 99% chirally pure product; it is very strongly implied to be an enantioselective modification of the racemic synthesis from phenylacetone.

These spasms are frequently misunderstood by the patient to be cancer due to the 'lump in the throat' feeling (Globus pharyngis) that is symptomatic of this syndrome. Cricopharyngeal spasm is an uncomfortable but harmless and temporary disorder. Signs and symptoms * Sensation of a 'lump' in the back of the throat * Throat feels swollen * Discomfort - Lump can often feel quite big and pain is occasional * Symptoms normally worse in the evening * Stress aggravates the symptoms * Saliva is difficult to swallow, yet food is easy to swallow - eating, in fact, often makes the tightness go away for a time * 'Lump' sensation comes and goes from day to day * Symptoms can persist for very long periods, often several months. * The symptoms can be mimicked by pushing on the cartilage in the neck, just below the Adam's apple  Causes  Causes include stress and anxiety. Other causes are not yet clear. In some cases, eating certain foods may bring on acute spasms, in susceptible individuals. Peanuts, pumpkin seeds and other nuts may trigger these spasms.  Physiology  There are two sphincters in the oesophagus. They are normally contracted and they relax when one swallows so that food can pass through them going to the stomach. They then squeeze closed again to prevent regurgitation of the stomach contents. If this normal contraction becomes a spasm, these symptoms begin. Diagnosis  Treatment  No cure for the condition as such exists. A number of treatments may provide partial relief: * Botox injections may temporarily disable the muscle and provide relief for 3-4 months per injection * Muscle relaxants ** Lorazepam (Ativan), diazepam (Valium) and other benzodiazepines relax the smooth muscle in the throat, slowing or halting contractions. In some people, benzodiazepines may have addictive properties. * Stress reduction ** High stress levels make these spasms more noticeable ** It is advisable to take note of when your symptoms are at their worst * Warm fluids ** Hot fluids may be helpful for some people with cricopharyngeal spasm (or other esophageal disorders) * Tricyclic anti- depressants (Pamelor, etc.), taken in small doses, have been having positive results recently, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

It used to be the main airport for Nancy, however commercial airline traffic was moved to the new Metz-Nancy-Lorraine Airport in 1991. The airfield is open to the domestic and international non-scheduled commercial, private aircraft, for IFR and VFR, supporting general aviation and charter aircraft operations. History Before 1926 the site was used as a military airfield. However, the airfield was too small, and without possibility of extension and being judged difficult to use, the airfield at the site was closed. In 1936, the current airport was built as a grass airfield for the French Air Force, and was used as a flight school. In addition to the military use before World War II, because of the proximity of Paris, the airport was used in the mid-1930s by the postal company Blue Air, which operated a service between Paris-Le Bourget ‚Äì Nancy ‚Äì Strasbourg, but this was short lived. After the Battle of France in 1940, the airfield was seized by the German Luftwaffe, and was used as a transport/combat glider airfield during 1943 and 1944. It was attacked on several occasions by Allied bombers. American units began to move into the Nancy area in late September 1944, and the airfield was liberated in early October. Relatively undamaged, some Pierced Steel Planking was laid down to patch the main runway, and the airfield was declared operationally usable by the combat engineers on 15 October 1944. It was designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"Y-42\\". The airport was used by the Americans as a light aircraft liaison airfield to support the numerous command and control organizations in the Nancy area until the end of the war, with the last unit returning to the United States in September 1945. It was then returned to local French authorities. Reconstructed, the airport was used by the French Army as a light aviation airfield from the mid-1950s until the 1990s. Commercial use of the airport also resumed in the 1950s The airport was used by commercial airlines until 1991 including Air Vosges, Rousseau Aviation, Air Alsace and TAT which later became Air Libert√©. In the early 1980s passenger use exceeded 50,000 per passengers per year. The site hosts a large school of pilot training, and is used primarily for pleasure flights and business charters. It also can be used as an emergency landing site for commercial aircraft.

Among his awards are The Marten Toonder Prize and The Irish American Culture Institute Prize for Literature. Early life Micheal O'Siadhail was born into a middle-class Dublin family. His father, a chartered accountant, was born in County Monaghan and worked most of his life in Dublin, and his mother was a Dubliner with roots in County Tipperary. Both of them are portrayed in his work in several poems such as \\"Kinsmen\\" and \\"Promise\\". From the age of twelve, O'Siadhail was educated at the Jesuit boarding school Clongowes Wood College, an experience he was later to describe in a sequence of poems \\"Departure\\" (The Chosen Garden). At Clongowes he was influenced by his English teacher, the writer Tom McIntyre, who introduced him to contemporary poetry. At thirteen he first visited the Aran Islands. This pre-industrial society with its large- scale emigration had a profound impact on him. His earlier work reflects this tension between his love of his native Dublin and his emotional involvement with those outlying communities and which features in the sequence \\"Fists of Stone\\" (The Chosen Garden). Career He studied at Trinity College Dublin (1964‚Äì68) where his teachers included David H. Greene and M√°irt√≠n √ì Cadhain. He was elected a Scholar of the College and took a First Class Honours Degree. His circle in Trinity included David McConnell (later professor of genetics), Mary Robinson and David F. Ford (later Regius Professor of Divinity at Cambridge University). O'Siadhail subsequently embarked on a government exchange scholarship and studied folklore and Icelandic at the University of Oslo. He has retained lifelong contacts with Norwegian friends and sees Scandinavian literature as a major influence. In 1970 he married Br√≠d N√≠ Chearbhaill, who was born in Gweedore in County Donegal. She was for most of her life a teacher and later headmistress in an inner-city Dublin primary school until her retirement in 1995 due to Parkinson's disease. She has been a central figure in O'Siadhail's oeuvre, celebrated in the sequence \\"Rerooting\\" in The Chosen Garden and in Love Life, which is a meditation on their lifelong relationship. One Crimson Thread travels with the progression of Br√≠d's Parkinson's Disease. Br√≠d died on 17 June 2013. For seventeen years, O'Siadhail earned his living as an academic; firstly as a lecturer at Trinity College (1969‚Äì73) where he was awarded an MLitt in 1971, and then as a research professor at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. During these years he gave named lectures in Dublin and at Harvard University and Yale University and was a visiting professor at the University of Iceland in 1982. In 1987 he resigned his professorship to devote himself to writing poetry which he described as \\"a quantum leap\\". He served as a member of the Arts Council of the Republic of Ireland (1987‚Äì93), of the Advisory Committee on Cultural Relations (1989‚Äì97), and was editor of Poetry Ireland Review. He was the founding chairman of ILE (Ireland Literature Exchange). As a founder member of Aosd√°na (Academy of Distinguished Irish Artists) he is part of a circle of artists and has worked with his friend, the composer Se√≥irse Bodley, the painters Cecil King and Mick O'Dea, and in 2008 he gave a reading as part of Brian Friel's eightieth birthday celebration. He represented Ireland at the Poetry Society's European Poetry Festival in London in 1981 and at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1997. He was writer-in-residence at the Yeats Summer School in 1991 and writer-in-residence at the University of British Columbia in 2002. He is now married to Christina Weltz, who is a native of New York, and Assistant Professor of surgical oncology at Mount Sinai. They reside in New York. In 2018, Micheal was included in The Tablet magazine's ‚Ä≤Fifty Minds That Matter‚Ä≤ ‚Äì fifty men and women who are ‚Ä≥adding some Catholic salt to the contemporary cultural soup‚Ä≥. Included on this list is Pope Francis, Martin Scorsese and Bruce Springsteen. During his years as an academic, O'Siadhail, writing under the Irish spelling of his name, published works on the linguistics of Irish and a textbook for learners of Irish. Content and context David F. Ford points out in Musics of Belonging (Carysfort Press, Dublin 2007) how \\"beside the new architectonics since the move to full-time writing there has also been an alternation between more personal and more public themes\\". Ford lists the characteristic themes in O'Siadhail's work which emerge from early on as: \\"despair, women, love, friendship, trust, language, school, vocation, music city life, science, Irish and other cultures and histories\\". He adds that \\"there is a wrestling for meaning, with no easy solutions ‚Äì both the form and the content are hard-won\\". Several critics have highlighted how O'Siadhail uses a vast variety of classic forms including sonnets, terza rima, villanelles, haikus etc. alongside an array of new intricate forms as befits his themes. His work has been compared by some commentators to Dante, John Milton and Patrick Kavanagh but most often to John Donne. Recent criticism has drawn attention to the depth and range of his intellectual engagements. Mary O'Donnell traced the influence of the philosopher Emmanuel Levinas in A Fragile City and the academic and critic Eugene O'Brien, editor of The Irish Book Review, described his work as \\"that rare combination of the intellectual and the emotional\\". Development The trajectory in O'Siadhail's work first moves beyond the sense of despair which haunted his youth, through the collections of once-off poems into the architectonics of his larger thematic books. In 1978, O'Siadhail published his first poetry collection The Leap Year (originally written in Irish), which was a meditation on healing and nature set against an urban background. This was followed in 1980 by Rungs of Time (originally in Irish) which in an almost Edda-like style announced many of the characteristic themes that would dominate his work; and in 1982 Belonging (the last of this trio originally written in Irish) emphasised, by its title, relationships as a major theme. There were two more collections which contain a few of his best known poems, Springnight in 1983 and The Image Wheel in 1985, before he went full-time and began a series of books based on broad themes. The Chosen Garden, which appeared in 1990, he himself described as \\"an effort to face my own journey, to comprehend and trace one's own tiny epic\\". In 1992 he published Hail! Madam Jazz: New and Selected Poems which includes the new sequence The Middle Voice. In 1995 came A Fragile City, which is a meditation in four parts on the theme of trust. Our Double Time, published three years later in 1998, explores the liberation of facing human finitude in a way that allows a greater intensity of living. Then in 2002 The Gossamer Wall was published. It evokes the Holocaust from its origins to its aftermath in a book-length sequence of stark intensity and was shortlisted for the Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Literary Prize. In Love Life in 2005, O'Siadhail reflects on and rejoices in a long marriage. This was followed in 2007 by Globe, which ponders the dynamics of history in a fast-changing world, its tragedies and achievements as well as its potential.

The overall weapon was based on the Thompson Submachine Gun which Hyde himself designed many of his weapons on. An original .30 Carbine calibre carbine based on the M1921/27 variants, it worked well but due to the war effort was found expensive for mass production and its weight defied the concept of a Light Rifle. The M1944 Hyde Carbine came with a quick barrel change device similar to the MG42M1944 Hyde Carbine Top and bottom views; Side view. and pressed steel components to ease production/reduce weight. The M1944 Hyde Carbine was more reliable and accurate than the M1 Carbine that was adopted and also came with the capability of select fire, which made it close to the likes of the StG-44.  Overview  While an obvious copy of the MG42 (which then had only been produced for two years), it was dubious why a quick-change barrel was necessary on a submachine gun. The bolt has the rat-tail, similar to a Solothurn MP-34, where the spring is contained within the buttstock. This is an interesting example of \\"making a gun out of sheetmetal\\" rather than \\"making a sheet metal gun\\".

Biography Mario Fucini was born on 1 February 1891 in Empoli. As World War I began, he volunteered for military service in the engineers. He was appointed as a Sottotenente on 9 May 1915. After a transfer to the Corpo Aeronautico Militare, he earned a pilot's license on 13 March 1916.Franks et al 1997, pp. 140-141. The following month, he qualified to fly Voisins. On 12 April 1916, he was assigned as a pilot to 5a Squadriglia Voisin (later to become 25a Squadriglia). On 28 July 1916, he completed a bombing sortie despite constant attacks by a pair of enemy fighters; he was awarded a Silver Medal for Military Valor for this feat. On 16 February 1917, he brought back his flaming Voisin to a landing at Monfalcone; he received a Bronze Medal for Military Valor for saving the craft and himself. The next month, he underwent conversion training to the Pomilio PC. This was followed by a May stint in gunnery school in Pisa. It was about this time that he was promoted to Tenente. On 1 July 1917, he was assigned to a fighter squadron, 84a Squadriglia. A fortnight later, he was appointed to command the Grottaglie Defense Section. Here he flew a Nieuport. In September 1917, he reported to Malpensa for conversion training on the Ansaldo SVA. On 27 September, he was posted to the nascent 87a Squadriglia. Towards the end of 1917, he moved on to 76a Squadriglia, with the official date of transfer being 5 December. However, he submitted two victory claims with the squadron prior to that date. At any rate, by year's end he was known to be flying a Hanriot HD.1, which he used through war's end. On 18 February 1918, he was transferred to 78a Squadriglia. He would continue to post victory claims, tallying 13 before war's end. His diligence was rewarded with a second Silver Medal for Military Valor, received 15 August 1918. On 3 November, even as the Austro- Hungarian foe surrendered, Fucini was admitted to hospital. A week later, he was assigned to the Technical Section in Turin. On 1 February 1919, the Bongiovanni military intelligence commission credited Mario Fucini with seven confirmed aerial victories.Franks et al 1997, pp. 167-168. He remained in aviation as the Corpo became the Regia Aeronautica, rising to successive commands of 29a Squadriglia and 78a Squadriglia. In 1931, he was promoted to Tenente Colonnello. In 1932, he published Voli sul nemico, his memoirs. He was given command of the Castiglione Fighter School in 1933. From December 1933 through August 1925, Fucini edited the official journal of the Regia Aeronautica, the Rivista Aeronautica. He retired from active duty on 15 September 1937. However, in April 1953, he was promoted to General in the reserves. Mario Fucini died in Rome, Italy on 1 September 1977.

A site at the intersection of Bissonnet Street and Ashby Street in Southampton has been the focus of considerable controversy since the mid-2000s, when a 21-story apartment tower was first proposed for the lot. The \\"Ashby highrise\\" development generated strong backlash from area homeowners, who consider the building incompatible with their predominately single-family neighborhood. The site has been the subject of multiple lawsuits and has spurred a wider discussion about Houston's lack of zoning laws. In 2013, the Houston Police Department staged an operation, the \\"Bissonnet Initiative\\", which resulted in the arrest of more than 100 people involved in a prostitution ring at the intersection of Bissonnet and Beechnut near Beltway 8.

It deals with the culmination of the \\"Dark Reign\\" story line, which saw Norman Osborn become the United States primary defense officer, leading H.A.M.M.E.R. as well as employing his own evil Avengers. The story depicts Loki manipulating Osborn into leading an all-out assault on Asgard, at the time located within the United States. Captain America and his own Avengers lead a rebellion against Osborn. The events in Siege led to Marvel Comics introducing the subsequent storyline \\"Heroic Age\\". Publication history \\"Siege\\"' consists of an eponymous four-issue mini-series, and a number of related tie-in books, including one-shots, miniseries, and existing ongoing series. Marvel announced in early 2010 that the company's \\"Siege\\" storyline would be followed by the \\"Heroic Age\\" story-line. This was first hinted at in the story by Athena to Amadeus Cho.Incredible Hercules #127. Marvel Comics. Publication aftermath The end of aftermath was described as what would be the start of a new \\"Heroic Age\\" in the Marvel Universe. The final tie-in issues of the four Avengers titles, Mighty Avengers #36, New Avengers #64, Dark Avengers #16 and Avengers: The Initiative #35 were the last ones of those series, along with a New Avengers: Finale one-shot, with illustrations by Bryan Hitch. From June 2010 Marvel published Avengers Prime: Siege Aftermath. This five-part series focused on Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America and bridged the gap between \\"Siege\\" and \\"Heroic Age\\". Though not badged as an aftermath series, a limited series starting in May 2010 examined the fall of Norman Osborn and examine the effects upon his son Harry Osborn. The series was titled Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son.Rogers, Vaneta (February 8, 2010). \\"The AMERICAN SON Returns to SPIDER-MAN's World in May\\". Newsarama. Plot Norman Osborn calls a meeting of the super-villain Cabal, consisting of Doctor Doom, the Hood, the Taskmaster and the Asgardian God Loki, to discuss Asgard the home of the Norse Gods now floating above Broxton, Oklahoma, and the last holdout in Osborn's consolidation of power. A rift develops between Doom and Osborn, creating mayhem that appears to dissolve the group. Later, under his guise of respectability, Osborn attempts in vain to secure permission from the President of the United States to invade Asgard claiming it poses a national security threat. On Loki's advice, Osborn engineers a tragedy in which the hapless Asgardian Volstagg, manipulated into battling the super-villain team the U-Foes, inadvertently causes an explosion that kills everyone in a crowded Soldier Field football stadium in Chicago, Illinois. This gives Osborn the justification to lay siege on Asgard with military troops as well as with the Dark Avengers‚Äîhis team of super-villains posing as superheroes and with loyalists planted amid the various 50-State Initiative teams of heroes. Osborn's aide-de-camp, Victoria Hand suggests unsuccessfully that Osborn seek therapy for his instability. Shortly afterward, the President realizes that Osborn is unstable and orders Hand to produce him. In the meantime, in order to better control the highly powerful but psychologically fragile superhero the Sentry, who has allowed himself to be under Osborn's care, Osborn has the villainous Bullseye kill the Sentry's wife, Lindy Reynolds. He then claims that she committed suicide. Concurrently, Loki prepares Asgard for invasion through selective assassination and by neutralizing Heimdall, the city's guardian. The siege begins with the Sentry attacking Asgard, followed by a massive aerial assault led by Osborn in his Iron Patriot armor. The Asgardian Thunder-God Thor, who has been banished from Asgard for some time, is stunned and falls in battle. With the attack on Asgard instantly becoming a major news story, Steve Rogers, the erstwhile Captain America, assembles a group of legitimate Avengers in Brooklyn, New York City, to battle the Dark Avengers, help defend Asgard, and aid their comrade Thor. At the same time, the Avengers resistance led by Tigra, Justice, and Gauntlet launch their own attack on Camp H.A.M.M.E.R., aimed at eliminating Osborn's Initiative. Osborn's people offer Todd Keller, a conservative talk show host, exclusive official coverage of the siege, in order to mold public opinion. Meanwhile, longtime investigative journalist Ben Urich, editor of the New York City newspaper The Front Line, heads to the Oklahoma battle site with cameraman Will Stern. Volstagg, whom they meet in a chance encounter along the way, accompanies them and gives the reporters his own perspective. As the battle in Asgard intensifies, the Olympian warrior Ares, whom Osborn had deceptively recruited to his Dark Avengers, realizes the truth about Osborn and vows to kill him. Osborn has the Sentry kill Ares instead. Osborn declares martial law just as Rogers and a contingent of Avengers arrives.Siege #2 Volstagg, with the aid of a local sheriff who is suspicions of Osborn, speaks to the public from a webcam video. This leads to the beginning of public disenchantment with the increasingly volatile Osborn. The siege continues with the super-villain Scourge using the enchanted spear of Asgard's ruler, Odin, to sever the left limbs of the superhero U.S. Agent.Thunderbolts #142 The conflicted hero Night Thrasher who had been compelled to make a Faustian bargain with Osborn, turns on him by battling his Cabal minion the Hood.Avengers: The Initiative #34 In Washington, the President orders the Secretary of State to dispatch military forces to Oklahoma to have Osborn and the Dark Avengers arrested for treason. At that moment in Asgard, Osborn is struck down by Captain America's shield,Siege #3 yet manages to order the Sentry to destroy the infrastructure of Asgard. Sentry, having survived a flurry of brutal blows from Thor, unscathed and on the verge of tearing Thor apart, transforms into the evil Void (which greatly multiplies his power to evolved heights) and leaves Thor. He then annihilates Asgard bringing it crashing down to Earth.Thor #608 Rogers finds Osborn in the wreckage and places him under arrest. Before anyone can react further, Osborn's armor, now under the control of its original inventor, Tony Stark explodes off his body on live television, revealing his face painted in the image of the Green Goblin. He begins raving that now that he is powerless, he no longer has the leverage to control the Sentry, who is now fully possessed by his nihilistic other self, the Void. Osborn is convinced that the Void is, in fact, the Angel of Death. As the Void battles the Avengers, Loki repents and begs Odin to let him use the mystical Norn Stones to power-boost the heroes and give them the strength to win the day. The Void, realizing that the heroes' enhanced power is being granted to them by Loki, kills him. Spurred on by Loki's sacrifice, Thor, and the others battle the Void to the point that it reverts to the Sentry's human form. The Sentry begs the heroes to kill him, and Thor regretfully complies, striking the Sentry down with a lightning blast that leaves only a charred skeleton.Siege #4 As Thor takes the Sentry's body to the sun, the New Avengers round up the Dark Avengers (with the exception of Daken, who managed to escape unnoticed). Victoria Hand, the renegade members of the Initiative, the remaining members of the Cabal, and others, are placed under arrest. Rogers gives his former partner, Bucky Barnes, his Captain America shield, passing him the mantle.Dark Avengers #16 As the Avengers and their allies celebrate their victory at Stark Tower, the Superhuman Registration Act is abolished and Thor and his fellow Asgardian warriors offer an alliance with Earth, creating a portal to Asgard atop Stark Tower. The President asks Rogers to take over Osborn's position. A large group of heroes later attend the Sentry's memorial service.The Sentry: Fallen Sun one-shot Rogers says that he will continue the 50 State Initiative and reform the original Avengers group with Bucky (as Captain America), Stark and Thor as its main members.Avengers: The Initiative #35 He also assigns Victoria Hand to work with the New Avengers. U.S. Agent is made warden of the maximum security super-villain prison The Raft.Thunderbolts #143 What If? In the special \\"What if...\\" series, the story \\"What if Osborn won the Siege of Asgard\\" is told. Ares gives in to his intuition before the Siege of Asgard, attacking Osborn in his own office after realizing Osborn lied to him. Sentry murders Ares on the spot allowing him to rest up between battles and to head into battle fully powered. In turn, this leads to him being able to kill Thor as well as Captain America. Most of the heroes present are subsequently slaughtered by the Dark Avengers. Doom has himself and Emma Frost teleported out of the battle and comes up with a new strategy. The new strategy has Emma scan the Dark Avengers and find out the truth about Lindy's death. Bullseye is found out, and Emma shows Sentry the truth of what happens, with catastrophic results. Sentry's fragile psyche is shattered entirely and he goes on a murderous rampage, killing both Frost and Bullseye, before transforming into a fully powered Void, who then kills Doom, Taskmaster, and the Hood. He then confronts Osborn and thanks him for releasing him, only to kill him too. In the end, with the Avengers, Dark Avengers, and the Gods all defeated, none is left to fight the Void and he eventually consumes Earth entirely, before spreading out to the rest of the universe.

Built in 1868 for a prominent local merchant, it is one of the town's finest examples of Victorian residential architecture. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 12, 1985. Description and history The Moses-Kent House stands southwest of the town center of Exeter, at the southwest junction of Linden and Pine Streets. It occupies a large lot, more than in size, of which about are landscaped. The main house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a mansard roof, granite foundation, and an exterior finished in wooden siding scored to resemble ashlar stone. It is predominantly Second Empire in its styling, with strong Italianate influence. Its most prominent feature is a three-story tower with mansard roof and windows whose molded surrounds match those of the main mansard roof. The property includes a surviving 1868 carriage house. The interior of the house is well-preserved, retaining features from its construction, and from a later early 20th-century renovation. The house was built in 1868 by Henry Clay Moses, a local wool merchant, who purchased two lots and demolished the buildings standing on them to make way for it. Moses was known locally for his philanthropy, and opened portions of the property to the public as a park. It underwent significant alterations c. 1901-02 after it was purchased by George Kent, owner of the Exeter Manufacturing Company. The landscaping of its grounds are conjectured without evidence to have been influenced (directly or indirectly) by the work of Frederick Law Olmsted.

From 1963 to 1964 he was an Assistante at the Liceo Scientifico Leonardo da Vinci in Milan, and gained a Diploma in Education at the Oxford Institute of Education in 1966. Gilbert then worked for Argo Records as an assistant on recordings by Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger and as a record producer with Tom Paley, Shirley Collins, The Young Tradition and others. He recorded James Galway, who had been a student with his father, the Allegri Quartet and many others.John Selwyn Gilbert's professional Curriculum vitae Television career He joined the BBC in 1969 as a Production Director to help to set up the Open University. He produced and directed classical dramas, including Woyzeck, Six Characters in Search of an Author, The Way of the World and Peer Gynt (1976) for BBC/OU Productions before moving to BBC Music and Arts in 1978 as a Producer; he produced and directed TV programmes and films about Les Noces (with Leonard Bernstein and The Royal Ballet), Sir Frederick Ashton, Evelyn Waugh and Aubrey Beardsley (1982).Gilbert on the Internet Movie DatabaseAubrey by John Selwyn Gilbert His documentary Beardsley and his Work appeared on television in the United Kingdom in the same week as his drama Aubrey, a BBC 'Playhouse' drama in which Beardsley was portrayed by actor John Dicks. The drama followed Beardsley's life from Oscar Wilde's arrest in April 1895, which resulted in Beardsley losing his position at The Yellow Book, to his death from tuberculosis in 1898. While at the BBC, Gilbert also produced an arts magazine programme called Mainstream, a programme described by The Sunday Times TV critic as 'the worst programme in the history of television'; it is a comment Gilbert still treasures. Between 1979‚Äì83, Gilbert made documentaries about the excavation and raising of the Mary Rose.Chronicle: The Wreck of the Mary Rose British Film Institute website The first of these documentaries was cited by the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the Outside Broadcast when the Mary Rose was raised was nominated for a BAFTA award. Through his involvement in the Mary Rose project Gilbert learned to dive and organised and supervised all the underwater filming. He completed 114 working dives on the Mary Rose before the hull was raised. After leaving the BBC in 1983, Gilbert set up his own film company, JSG Productions, producing films for Channel 4, London Weekend Television and others until 1998. He also bought and ran a successful restaurant in Bristol from 1988 to 1996.

As its political programme the BNP proposed to use the \\"inevitable conflict\\" between the USSR and its Western Allies after the victory over Germany in the Second World War to gain independence for Belarus. After evacuation in 1944, the Foreign Sector of the BNP was created in Germany, led by D≈∫mitry Kasmoviƒç. Relations with the Belarusian Central Rada In 1944 the leaders of the BNP heavily criticized the Belarusian Central Rada, the pro-German government of Belarus, and its leader Radas≈Ça≈≠ Astro≈≠ski for taking a loyal position towards the Nazis. In early 1945 the BNP stopped all cooperation with the BCR. The BNP especially criticized the badly organized evacuation and practical liquidation of the Bie≈Çaruskaja Krajovaja Abarona, the military of the BCR, and Astro≈≠ski's inefficient attempts to create a Belarusian army in Germany.–¢—É—Ä–æ–Ω–∞–∫, –°.155. Several guerrilla units of the BNP continued its activities in Soviet-occupied Belarus in 1945-1946 but were soon liquidated by the Soviets. Activity after the war After the war the BNP acted among Belarusian refugees in Western Europe. The organization underwent many internal conflicts and a split in two parts in 1948-1949. In 1954 the BNP recognized the Belarusian Central Rada as \\"the only legitimate and representative centre\\". Structure The organization had a Central Committee and five regional committees.

It was published in 1974 by Bobbs-Merrill and a year later by Bantam. When college professor Peter Proud is overcome with a series of ever more frightening nightmares he seeks professional help from a colleague in the Psychology department who recommends outside help. All of his nightmares are similar and as he relates them to a psychologist recordings are made of him for future reference. When they are strung together they have him swimming in a lake at night and drowning at the hands of a woman who strikes at him from the safety of a rowboat, mercilessly bludgeoning him with her paddle. Deciding there is something to his nightmares he travels from California to the Eastern Seaboard to locate the exact location of the places he sees in his dreams - a church steeple, a town hall building and most importantly the lake where he keeps drowning. It helps being independently wealthy as he finds himself taking an extended sabbatical as he painstakingly goes through old newspaper records for cases of death by drowning. He eventually locates and confronts individuals who can remember the death. Although they do not recognize him because he looks different, one of them recognizes his mannerisms and believes he has come back from the dead for unspeakable reasons. Deciding he must get closer to the principals involved in his death he begins a romance with the daughter of the woman that may have murdered him out on the lake. At first he practices tennis with her. Later, it becomes more serious. Meanwhile, the woman who was married to him in his previous life has never remarried. She becomes suspicious of him, especially when he starts saying and doing things that remind her of her husband. Even though he does not look like her husband his mannerisms appear to identify him in an undeniable way. She is so certain that he is the same man as her husband that she feels she must do something about it, and possibly call him on it, if not take him out to the center of the lake and kill him all over again.

Built in 1836-37, it is one of the city's most unusual and elaborate examples of Greek Revival architecture. Built as a duplex, its first owners and occupants were Edward Kent, mayor and a future Governor of Maine, and his law partner, Jonas Cutting, a future Maine Supreme Judicial Court justice. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The Cutting-Kent House is located just in a residential area just northeast of Bangor's downtown, at the northwest corner of Penobscot and Pine Streets. It consists of a large two- story wood frame main block, to which additions have been made to the rear. The main block has elaborate and distinctive Greek Revival styling. Its front facade (facing south toward Penobscot street) has four bays recessed behind matchboarded walls headed by Doric pilasters. The first-floor bays have fluted Doric columns at each side, topped by carved wreaths. The center bays house the two unit entrances, and the outer bays have full-length windows; these all have flanking sidelight windows, and the window bays have wrought iron railings across the front. The upper level window bays also have ornate railings across the bays. The first floor of each side has a rounded window bay topped by a railing similar to the second-floor railings of the front. There is a dentillated cornice line between the floors and above the second floor, with a frieze board above that is punctuated by window openings covered with painted metal grillwork. The roof is a low-pitch hip roof. The rear additions added to each unit date to later in the 19th century, and are not as architecturally sophisticated. The house was built in 1836-37 for Edward Kent, then mayor of Bangor, and Jonas Cutting, his law partner. The house is of a sophistication that was typical of the residences of the city's elite lumber barons, and is believed to be stylistically unique in New England. Kent went on to serve two terms as Governor of Maine (1838‚Äì40), and Cutting was appointed to Maine's highest court in 1859 after serving the nation's diplomatic corps.

He sees Earth and people propelled by three transformations: climate change (global warming), urbanization and biotechnology. Brand tackles \\"touchy issues\\" like nuclear power, genetic engineering and geoengineering, \\"fully aware that many of the environmentalist readers he hopes to reach will start out disagreeing with him\\". Overview Brand said in an interview with Seed magazine, \\"...I'd accumulated a set of contrarian views on some important environmental issues‚Äîspecifically, cities, nuclear energy, genetic engineering, and geoengineering‚Äîand that it added up to a story worth telling.\\" The author cites numerous other authors both in the recommended reading sectionBrand 2009, pp. 303‚Äì313 and in live lectures. In particular, book influences are Constant Battles by Steven A.

And some of these issues are of such scale that you got to have the governments doing things like making carbon expensive. Or making coal expensive to burn and putting all that carbon into the atmosphere. And individuals can't do that, individual communities can't do that. It takes national governments.\\" Synopsis Speaking on \\"Rethinking Green\\", Brand provided a short version of his book: The book challenges traditional environmentalist thinking around four major issues: *Cities are green. *Nuclear power is green. *Genetic engineering is green. *Geoengineering is probably necessary. And he summarized the book. Urbanization, or the move to cities, requires grid electricity, which one chapter discusses, in particular nuclear power. Another two chapters explain the need for genetic engineering. A \\"sermon\\" on science and large-scale geoengineering is a fourth chapter. Fifth is a chapter on restoration of natural infrastructure and benevolent ecosystem engineering. Finally, Brand concludes with humans' obligation to \\"learn planet craft\\", to enhance life and Earth like an earthworm.Brand 2009, p. 23 Criticism Amory Lovins published a critique at the Rocky Mountain Institute, saying on NPR that nuclear energy is not the most cost-effective solution, that it is too expensive and slow to build. Jim Riccio, a spokesman for Greenpeace speaking with Green Inc. of The New York Times, called Brand's arguments \\"nonsensical, especially concerning the abysmal economics of nuclear power.\\" David Lewis, a former Speaker of the Green Party of British Columbia and former prominent Canadian ozone activist, who believes Brand's views on nuclear power have a sound foundation, asks \\"How can Brand champion the views of a climate science denier who denounces climate scientists and expect to be taken seriously by environmentalists?\\"Stewart Brand: Fearless Follower of Lovelock, not science The Energy Collective, November 14, 2010 Retrieved July 20, 2010 \\"(Environmentalists) are viewing what I'm saying more in sorrow than in anger,\\" Brand told the Toronto Star.

The term covers a wide variety of situations and degrees of economic, social, and physical coercion. Child harvesting programs or the locations at which they take place are sometimes referred to as baby factories or baby farms. Markets Child harvesting typically refers to situations where children are sold for adoption, but may also refer to situations in which children are trafficked to provide slave labor. It is particularly associated with and prevalent in some international adoption markets. Infants who are trafficked are often eventually forced to work in plantations, mines and factories, as domestic workers or as sex workers. There have been a very few allegations of some child harvesting programs that provide infants to be tortured or sacrificed in black magic or witchcraft rituals. Nigerian security agents have uncovered a series of alleged baby factories in recent years, notably in the southeastern part of the country. Human trafficking is widespread in west Africa, where children are bought from their families to work in plantations, mines and factories or as domestic help. Others are sold into prostitution, and less commonly they are tortured or sacrificed in black magic rituals. Human trafficking, including selling children, is prohibited under Nigerian law (PDF), but almost 10 years ago a UNESCO report (PDF) on human trafficking in Nigeria identified the business as the country‚Äôs third- most common crime behind financial fraud and drug trafficking, and the situation certainly has not improved. At least 10 children are reportedly sold every day across the country.

The trend is precipitated by various factors including a social premium placed on child bearing and social stigmas around infertility and teenage pregnancy. A black market for newly born babies has developed in parts of the country to provide infants to wealthy families who prefer cheaper clandestine methods as a substitute for surrogacy, in vitro fertilization, assisted reproductive technology or adoption through social services.Makinde OA, Olaleye O, Makinde OO, Huntley SS, Brown B.

(cited July 24, 2015) The majority of the women whose children are sold are young unmarried women from lower-income households who are scared of social stigmatization as a result of an unwanted teenage pregnancy. Some of the young girls come to the baby factory after searching for abortion clinics, though others have been kidnapped. Most of the discovered baby factories are found in Southern Nigeria with high incidence in Ondo, Ogun, Imo, Akwa Ibom Abia and Anambra.

Infertile women are noted to be major patrons of these baby factories due to the stigmatization of childless couples in Southern Nigeria and issues around cultural acceptability of surrogacy and adoption. These practices have contributed to the growth in the industry which results in physical, psychological, and sexual violence to the victims.  Prevention  Tackling baby factories will involve a multifaceted approach that includes advocacy and enacting of legislation barring baby factories and infant trafficking and harsh consequences for their patrons. Also, programs to educate young girls on preventing unwanted pregnancies are needed. Methods of improving awareness and acceptability of adoption and surrogacy and reducing the administrative and legal bottlenecks associated with these options for infertile couples should be explored to diminish the importance of baby factories See also * Child labour * Child laundering * Child-selling * Child trafficking * Commercial sexual exploitation of children * Human trafficking in Nigeria * Trafficking of children * List of international adoption scandals * Surrogacy * Assisted reproductive technology * Adoption References External links * Baby factories: How pregnancies, deliveries are framed at Vanguard * Video: The Nigerian Connection II (18:15-23:10) of Al Jazeera * Baby factories in Nigeria: Starting the discussion toward a national prevention policy in Trauma, Violence and Abuse Journal,July 2015. * Baby factories taint surrogacy in Nigeria in Reproductive Biomedicine Online Journal, October, 2015 * Infant Trafficking and Baby Factories: A New Tale of Child Abuse in Nigeria in Child Abuse Review Journal, November 2015 Category:Child abuse Category:Children's rights Category:Human rights abuses Category:Human trafficking Category:Human reproduction Category:Natalism ","title":"Child harvesting"},{"id":"24940000","text":"Stone House on Kentucky River is located in Prestonville, Kentucky.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 21, 1989. Description and history The Fort Kent Railroad Station is located at the northeast corner of Main and Market Streets (United States Route 1 and Maine State Route 161 respectively), between Market Street to the west and the railroad track to the east. It is a long rectangular single-story wood frame structure with a gable-on-hip roof, clapboard siding, and a concrete foundation. The station's east facade has a projecting telegrapher's bay, large baggage doors to the south, and windows and doors for the ticketing area and waiting room to the north. The station was opened in 1902 by the Fish River Railroad, which was later absorbed into the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad. The railroad's arrival had a major economic impact on the regions, enabling the shipment of its products (principally lumber and potatoes) to distant markets. By the 1970s the railroad was in decline, and in 1979 the station was given to the Fort Kent Historical Society. Of the stations built by either railroad, this one is among the best-preserved. Its interior has been converted into a museum space dedicated to local rail-related history, and is generally open during summer months.

The birthplace has been given specifically as Bijela Rudina, Bileƒáa. His family originated from Klobuk. An Ottoman sultan wrote in a book that he had requested from a notable lord in Herzegovina, named Predojeviƒá, that 30 small Serb children (including Predojeviƒá's only son Jovan, and his nephew Nikola) to be sent to Ottoman service (see devshirme). The very young Nikola was then taken to Constantinople as acem-i oƒülan (foreign child) and brought up in the Sultan's court, converting to Islam, adopting the name Hasan and advancing to the post of √ßakirciba≈üa (chief falconer and commander of falconers in the Sultan's court). After having been appointed Beglerbeg of Bosnia, Telli Hasan Pasha had the Rmanj Monastery renewed as a seat of his brother, Serbian Orthodox monk Gavrilo Predojeviƒá. He also founded a mosque in Polje, Grabovica, in the Bileƒáa municipality. Ottoman service Sanjak- bey of Segedin During the rule of Murat III (1574‚Äì1595) he became Sanjak- bey of the Sanjak of Segedin, where he stayed until June 1591. Beylerbey of Bosnia Hasan-pa≈°a Predojeviƒá led the Ottoman army from the Bosnia Eyalet into the Battle of Sisak in 1593. He was elevated and appointed Beglerbeg (Governor-General) of the Bosnia Eyalet in 1591. A bellicose and dynamic military leader, Hasan strengthened the army of the Eyalet equipping it with better horses and erecting a bridge at Gradi≈°ka with the purpose of easier maneuvering between Bosnia and Slavonia.R.

In August 1591, without a declaration of war, Hasan Pasha attacked Habsburg Croatia and reached Sisak, but was repelled after 4 days of fighting. Thomas Erd≈ëdy, the Ban of Croatia, launched a counterattack and seized much of the Moslavina region. The same year Hasan Pasha launched another attack, taking the town of Ripaƒç on the Una River. These raids forced the Ban to declare a general uprising to defend the country in late January, 1592.Vjekoslav Klaiƒá: Povijest Hrvata od najstarijih vremena do svr≈°etka XIX. stoljeƒáa, Knjiga peta, Zagreb, 1988, p. 471 These actions of the Ottoman regional forces under Hasan Pasha seem to have been contrary to the interest and policy of the central Ottoman administration in Constantinople,Moaƒçanin, Nenad: Some Problems of Interpretation of Turkish Sources concerning the Battle of Sisak in 1593, in: Nazor, Ante et al (ed.), Sisaƒçka bitka 1593 , Proceedings of the Meeting from 18‚Äì19 June 1993.

Hasan Pasha's forces of approximately 20,000 janissaries continued to raid the region, with the goal of seizing the strategically important town of Senj and its port, and to eliminate the Uskoci as well; because of all this, the Holy Roman Emperor sent his ambassador so he would beg that Hasan Pasha be removed from his post, or otherwise an end would be put to the existing truce. The ambassador was told in reply, that it belonged to the Grand Vizier and to Dervi≈°-pa≈°a, the Sultan's favourite, to repel their aggressions against the Ottoman Empire; that, the imperial ambassador was told, was a sufficient answer. After learning this, Hasan Pasha felt himself encouraged enough to lead his forces towards Bihaƒá, which was conquered on June 19, 1592 after eight days of siege, along with several surrounding forts. Records show that nearly 2,000 people died in defense of the town, and an estimated 800 children were taken for Ottoman servitude (see devshirme), to be educated in Islam and become janissaries, as Hasan had been himself. After having placed a sufficient garrison in Bihaƒá, he erected two other fortresses in its vicinity; the command of which he conferred to Rustem-beg, who was the leader of the Grand Vizier Ferhad Pasha's militia. In all, during this two-year campaign, the Ottoman Bosnian regional invading forces, led by Hasan Pasha, burned to the ground 26 cities throughout the Croatian Frontier and took some 35,000 war captives. At the same time, at Predojeviƒá's order, Orthodox Serbs were settled in the \\"whole region around Bihaƒá\\" from 1592 to 1593, Predojevic fully relied on Vlachs using them as soldiers. According to an official report, Vlachs by Hasan's order in 1593 after the fall of Bihaƒá, settled the areas around Brekovica, Ripaƒç, Ostrvica, Vrla Draga up to Sokolac.( while Orthodox Vlachs from Eastern Herzegovina, and with them some Turkish and Bosnian Muslim aristocratic feudal landlords as well, were settled in the central part of the Una river region (Pounje), around Brekovica, Ripaƒç, Ostrovica and Vrla Draga up to Sokolovac, in such numbers that they formed a significant population of this region. Fethija, a mosque in Bihaƒá, formerly a Romanic church. After the fall of the city to the Ottoman army, and its conversion into capital of its own Sanjak, the old main Romanic church was converted into a mosque and renamed Fethija (\\"conquered\\") At first, Telli Hasan Pasha's troops met little resistance, allowing them to capture numerous Uskoci settlements, where they enslaved or slaughtered the entire population and burned the settlements. His forces soon besieged and captured Senj and exterminated the Uskoci population. For his successes, the Pasha was awarded the title of \\"Vizier\\" by the Sultan. However, the following year, Telli Hasan Pasha decided to advance further into Croatia. His force of some twenty-thousand was soundly defeated in his third attempt to conquer Sisak, in the battle that took place near by that fortified town,Luthar 2008, p. 215 in which Hasan Pasha is generally reported to have died,Ivo Goldstein: Croatia.

According to Mustafa Naima: \\"The brave Hasan Pasha himself also met with his fate, having fallen into the river with one of the bridges which had been cut to prevent the pursuit of the enemy. Such was the result of this terrible day.\\" Indeed, after he had drowned in the river, his dress was taken as a trophy to Ljubljana where it was remade into the sacerdotal coat worn by the bishop during the celebration of the Thanksgiving mass. Aftermath and legacy A monastery was built on the location of his grave, after requests of a Predojeviƒá to Sultan Murad, who also granted Koluniƒá and Smiljan (metochion).

The play In the opening scene, Abraham prays to God, thanking Him for His various blessings, most of all his favourite son, Isaac. Next, God reveals to an angel that he will test Abraham's faith by asking him to sacrifice Isaac. The angel conveys this instruction to Abraham who, though he is distraught, agrees to comply with it. Abraham takes Isaac to the place of sacrifice, his grief made all the greater by Isaac (not yet knowing he is the \\"qweke best\\" intended for sacrifice) being eager to aid his father. When Abraham reveals that he means to kill him, Isaac at first pleads for his life. However, when he learns that it is God's will that he should die, Isaac acquiesces in his death, even urging his father not to tarry over the deed. Abraham binds Isaac so that he will not deflect his father's sword but when he draws that sword and prepares to strike, the angel appears and takes it out of his hand. The angel reveals that God is pleased with Abraham's obedience and that Isaac need not be sacrificed after all. Leaving them with a ram, the angel departs. As they make the offering, God appears above (the medieval custom was to have God act at a higher level than other characters) and promises them that ‚Äúfor thys dede  I schall mvltyplye yowres botheres [both] sede  As thyke as sterres be in the skye‚Äù. In an epilogue a doctor, a stock figure in medieval drama, appears and points the moral that we should obey God's commandments and not rail against the designs God has for us. Scholarship The text of the play was lost until the 19th century, when a manuscript was found in a commonplace book dating from around 1470‚Äì80 at Brome Manor, Suffolk, England. The manuscript itself has been dated at 1454 at the earliest.Early English Drama: an anthology edited by John C. Coldewey, Routledge, 1993, This manuscript is now housed at Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.Google docs While Joseph Quincy Adams reckoned the Brome Abraham ‚Äúmust be dated as early as the fourteenth century,‚ÄùChief Pre-Shakespearean Dramas edited by Joseph Quincy Adams, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1924. most other scholars assign various periods of the fifteenth century for the play's composition. All of the surviving English mystery cycles (such as the N-Town Plays, Wakefield Mystery Plays, York Mystery Plays, and the first part of the Cornish language Ordinalia, along with another individual fifteenth-century English play, the so-called Northampton Abraham (or Dublin Abrahamso called because the manuscript is kept at Trinity College Library, Dublin).The Sacrifice of Isaac in Medieval English Drama) deal with the story of Abraham and Isaac. However, the Brome Abraham seems to be most closely related to the barbers' play of Abraham in the Chester Mystery Plays. A comparison of the texts reveals around 200 lines of striking similarity, in particular during the debates between Abraham and Isaac that are at the hearts of the plays. A. M. Kinghorn judged the Brome play to be a superior reworking of the Chester pageant, and accordingly dated the play to late in the fifteenth century.Medi√¶val Drama by A. M. Kinghorn, Evans Brothers, London 1968 However, comparing the two, J. Burke Severs decided that the Chester play was an expansion and reworking of the Brome one.The Sacrifice of Isaac in Medieval English Drama. It is not known whether the play was originally part of a larger cycle of mystery plays or if it stood by itself, as Osborn Waterhouse of the Early English Text Society believed (though he conceded that it was to be supposed ‚Äúthat the stage was the usual pageant, and the mode of performance practically identical with that of the regular cycle plays‚Äù). The play is often considered the best of Middle English Abraham plays, humane in its treatment of infanticide, inventive in its language; Lucy Toulmin Smith, a nineteenth-century editor, found it to be superior to others of the period on the same subject and in the twentieth century George K. Anderson thought the play, its \\"human qualities\\" and characterisation, \\"unusually good\\",Old and Middle English Literature From the Beginnings to 1485 by George K. Anderson, OUP, 1950, p.215 and Gassner thought it \\"a masterpiece\\".Medieval and Tudor Drama edited by John Gassner, Applause Theatre Book Publishers, 1963, 1995 reprint Adams noted that it was often reprinted due to its being \\"justly regarded as the best example of pathos in the early religious drama\\".

Species distribution modelling (SDM), also known as environmental (or ecological) niche modelling (ENM), habitat modelling, predictive habitat distribution modelling, and range mapping uses computer algorithms to predict the distribution of a species across geographic space and time using environmental data. The environmental data are most often climate data (e.g. temperature, precipitation), but can include other variables such as soil type, water depth, and land cover. SDMs are used in several research areas in conservation biology, ecology and evolution. These models can be used to understand how environmental conditions influence the occurrence or abundance of a species, and for predictive purposes (ecological forecasting). Predictions from an SDM may be of a species‚Äô future distribution under climate change, a species‚Äô past distribution in order to assess evolutionary relationships, or the potential future distribution of an invasive species. Predictions of current and/or future habitat suitability can be useful for management applications (e.g. reintroduction or translocation of vulnerable species, reserve placement in anticipation of climate change). There are two main types of SDMs. Correlative SDMs, also known as climate envelope models, bioclimatic models, or resource selection function models, model the observed distribution of a species as a function of environmental conditions. Mechanistic SDMs, also known as process-based models or biophysical models, use independently derived information about a species' physiology to develop a model of the environmental conditions under which the species can exist. The extent to which such modelled data reflect real-world species distributions will depend on a number of factors, including the nature, complexity, and accuracy of the models used and the quality of the available environmental data layers; the availability of sufficient and reliable species distribution data as model input; and the influence of various factors such as barriers to dispersal, geologic history, or biotic interactions, that increase the difference between the realized niche and the fundamental niche. Environmental niche modelling may be considered a part of the discipline of biodiversity informatics.  History  A. F. W. Schimper used geographical and environmental factors to explain plant distributions in his 1898 Pflanzengeographie auf physiologischer Grundlage (Plant Geography Upon a Physiological Basis). Andrew Murray used to environment to explain the distribution of mammals in his 1866 The Geographical Distribution of Mammals. Robert Whittaker's work with plants and Robert MacArthur's work with birds strongly established the role the environment plays in species distributions. Elgene O. Box constructed environmental envelope models to predict the range of tree species. His computer simulations were among the earliest uses of species distribution modelling. The adoption of more sophisticated generalised linear models (GLMs) made it possible to create more sophisticated and realistic species distribution models. The expansion of remote sensing and the development of GIS-based environmental modelling increase the amount of environmental information available for model-building and made it easier to use.  Correlative vs mechanistic models   Correlative SDMs  SDMs originated as correlative models. Correlative SDMs model the observed distribution of a species as a function of geographically referenced climatic predictor variables using multiple regression approaches. Given a set of geographically referred observed presences of a species and a set of climate maps, an algorithm find the most likely environmental ranges within which a species lives. Correlative SDMs assume that species are at equilibrium with their environment and that the relevant environmental variables have been adequately sampled. The models allow for interpolation between a limited number of species occurrences. For these algorithms to be effective, it is required to gather observations not only of species presences, but also of absences, that is, where the species does not live. Records of species absences are typically not as common as records of presences, thus often \\"random background\\" or \\"pseudo-absence\\" data are used to fit these models. If there are incomplete records of species occurrences, pseudo-absences can introduce bias. Since correlative SDMs are models of a species‚Äô observed distribution, they are models of the realized niche (the environments where a species is found), as opposed to the fundamental niche (the environments where a species can be found, or where the abiotic environment is appropriate for the survival). For a given species, the realized and fundamental niches might be the same, but if a species is geographically confined due to dispersal limitation or species interactions, the realized niche will be smaller than the fundamental niche. Correlative SDMs are easier and faster to implement than mechanistic SDMs, and can make ready use of available data. Since they are correlative however, they do not provide much information about causal mechanisms and are not good for extrapolation. They will also be inaccurate if the observed species range is not at equilibrium (e.g. if a species has been recently introduced and is actively expanding its range).  Mechanistic SDMs  Mechanistic SDMs are more recently developed. In contrast to correlative models, mechanistic SDMs use physiological information about a species (taken from controlled field or laboratory studies) to determine the range of environmental conditions within which the species can persist. These models aim to directly characterize the fundamental niche, and to project it onto the landscape. A simple model may simply identify threshold values outside of which a species can't survive. A more complex model may consist of several sub-models, e.g. micro-climate conditions given macro-climate conditions, body temperature given micro-climate conditions, fitness or other biological rates (e.g. survival, fecundity) given body temperature (thermal performance curves), resource or energy requirements, and population dynamics. Geographically referenced environmental data are used as model inputs. Because the species distribution predictions are independent of the species‚Äô known range, these models are especially useful for species whose range is actively shifting and not at equilibrium, such as invasive species. Mechanistic SDMs incorporate causal mechanisms and are better for extrapolation and non- equilibrium situations. However, they are more labor-intensive to create than correlational models and require the collection and validation of a lot of physiological data, which may not be readily available. The models require many assumptions and parameter estimates, and they can become very complicated. Dispersal, biotic interactions, and evolutionary processes present challenges, as they aren‚Äôt usually incorporated into either correlative or mechanistic models. Correlational and mechanistic models can be used in combination to gain additional insights. For example, a mechanistic model could be used to identify areas that are clearly outside the species‚Äô fundamental niche, and these areas can be marked as absences or excluded from analysis. See for a comparison between mechanistic and correlative models.  Niche modelling algorithms (correlative)  There are a variety of mathematical methods that can be used for fitting, selecting, and evaluating correlative SDMs. Algorithms include \\"profile\\" methods, which are simple statistical techniques that use e.g. environmental distance to known sites of occurrence such as BIOCLIM and DOMAIN; \\"regression\\" methods (e.g. forms of generalized linear models); and \\"machine learning\\" methods such as maximum entropy (MAXENT). An incomplete list of algorithms that have been used for niche modelling includes: Profile techniques *BIOCLIM *DOMAIN *Ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) *Mahalanobis distance *Isodar analysis Regression-based techniques *Generalized linear model (GLM) *Generalized additive model (GAM) *Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) Machine learning techniques *MAXENT *Artificial neural networks (ANN) *Genetic algorithm for rule set production (GARP) *Boosted regression trees (BRT)/gradient boosting machines (GBM) *Random forest (RF) *Support vector machines (SVM) Furthermore, ensemble models can be created from several model outputs to create a model that captures components of each. Often the mean or median value across several models is used as an ensemble. Similarly, consensus models are models that fall closest to some measure of central tendency of all models‚Äîconsensus models can be individual model runs or ensembles of several models.  Niche modelling software (correlative)  SPACES is an online Environmental niche modeling platform that allows users to design and run dozens of the most prominent algorithms in a high performance, multi-platform, browser-based environment. MaxEnt is the most widely used method/software uses presence only data and performs well when there are few presence records available. ModEco implements various algorithms. DIVA-GIS has an easy to use (and good for educational use) implementation of BIOCLIM The Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (BCCVL) is a \\"one stop modelling shop\\" that simplifies the process of biodiversity and climate impact modelling. It connects the research community to Australia's national computational infrastructure by integrating a suite of tools in a coherent online environment. Users can access global climate and environmental datasets or upload their own data, perform data analysis across six different experiment types with a suite of 17 different algorithms, and easily visualise, interpret and evaluate the results of the models. Experiments types include: Species Distribution Model, Multispecies Distribution Model, Species Trait Model (currently under development), Climate Change Projection, Biodiverse Analysis and Ensemble Analysis. Example of BCCVL SDM outputs can be found here Another example is Ecocrop, which is used to determine the suitability of a crop to a specific environment. This database system can also project crop yields and evaluate the impact of environmental factors such as climate change on plant growth and suitability. Most niche modelling algorithms are available in the R packages 'dismo', 'biomod2' and 'mopa'.. Software developers may want to build on the openModeller project. The Collaboratory for Adaptation to Climate Change adapt.nd.edu has implemented an online version of openModeller that allows users to design and run openModeller in a high-performance, browser-based environment to allow for multiple parallel experiments without the limitations of local processor power.

He spent the formative years of his professional career working for the noted Prairie School architect George Washington Maher. A member of the influential Chicago Architectural Club, Seyfarth was a product of the Chicago School of Architecture. Influences of style Photograph of a latticework porch by Robert Seyfarth on the front of a house he designed (likely the Bournique house at 421 [later 1509] Oakwood Av., Highland Park, IL [demolished]) which appeared in the June, 1916 edition of The Craftsman magazine. The article that accompanied the image had this to say about the design: The porch \\"...seems as perfect an architectural use for lattice as could be devised. There is a gracious hospitable informality about it that is most effective ... How delightfully simple are the design and proportion!\\" This deft handling of proportion and well-considered use of ornamentation is a distinguishing quality of Seyfarth's work and one that was heralded by The Craftsman and others who advanced the cause of modern architecture: \\"No richness of material or cunning use of handiwork is able to redeem bad proportion; good proportion rises superior to detail and glorifies the humblest material.\\" Although his early independent projects directly reflected Maher's stylistic influences, as his own style developed Seyfarth's work became distinguished more as a distillation of prevailing revivalist architecture, characterized not by the frequent devotion to detail that typified the movement but by strong geometry, a highly refined sense of proportion, and the selective, discriminating use of historical references. Although any use of these references was condemned by many of the proponents of what was seen as \\"modern\\" architecture in the ensuing years, \\"the neoclassical impulse ... was an effort to purge American architecture of the wilder excesses of historical revivalism [of the nineteenth century] by returning to fundamental architectural principles. The ideals this architecture sought to express were the very ones the most inventive Chicago architects were trying to embody in their own work - order, harmony, and repose ...\\". As a result, the conception of modern architecture was anything but a static event. \\"Architects and critics engaged in lively debates concerning the definition of modern architecture and the future direction of building design. This discourse reflected the development of diverse architectural ideologies and forms that ranged from Beaux-Arts classicism to streamlining.\\" Joseph Hudnut, the first dean of Harvard University's School of Design and a noted proponent of modern architecture, recognized the emotional limitations of houses that expressed their design using the typical modern vocabulary of glass, concrete and steel: \\"They have often interesting aesthetic qualities, they arrest us by their novelty and their drama, but too often they have very little to say to us\\". The case for the use of historic references in modern architecture was made by no less than William Adams Delano (1874-1960), who was considered to be one among the \\"new generation of architects [who] shaped and developed American taste, producing a style leavened with erudite abstraction and sparing composition\\". Delano argued that if a project was \\"handled with freedom and ... answered the needs of our present day clients, it will be really expressive of our own time\\". Seyfarth opted to take his career down this divergent path, and in doing so created a legacy of architecture that \\"speaks of good breeding with an independent spirit.\\"  Background  thumbleftThe three buildings on the right were owned by the Seyfarth family and stood on the south-west corner of Grove St. and Western Ave. in Blue Island, Illinois. The white building in the center of the photograph was the tavern that William Seyfarth operated after he came to Blue Island in 1848. It originally stood on the corner, but was remodeled and relocated in 1880 when the building shown here on the corner was erected to house Edward Seyfarth's hardware store. All three buildings were destroyed in the Great Blue Island Fire of 1896, which began in a shed behind the Bairischer Hof, the building to their immediate left. The Bairischer Hof survived the fire. Robert Seyfarth grew up as a member of a prominent local family. His grandfather William Seyfarth had come to the United States in 1848 from Schloss Tonndorf in what is now the state of Thuringia, Germany, with the intention of opening a tavern (what would now be considered an inn) in Chicago. Advised to locate outside of the city, he settled with his wife Louise in Blue Island, which a couple of years earlier had begun to experience an influx of immigration from what was then known as the German Confederation. William purchased a building that was standing at the south-west corner of Grove Street and Western Avenue and opened his business. The location was a good one - it was on what was then called the Wabash Road a day's journey from Chicago, which guaranteed the tavern a steady supply of prospective customers for many years. At about the same time he purchased a stone quarry about a mile south-west of the settlement (where Robbins, Illinois now stands) and operated it concurrently with the inn, although apparently without as much success. He was a member of the school board when Blue Island built its first brick schoolhouse in 1856, and served as clerk and later as assessor for the township of Worth from 1854 until he died in 1860. William and Louise had five sons, including Edward, who was the father of the architect. Edward Seyfarth was active in community affairs on many levels. Not only did he own and operate the local hardware store, but in 1874 he was a charter member of the Blue Island Ancient Free and Accepted Masons and in 1890 was one of the founders of the Calumet State Bank. He served as village treasurer from 1880‚Äì1886 and as village trustee from 1886‚Äì1889 and again from 1893-1895. Over the years other members of the family were also active in the community - they were involved in banking, the board of education, and the Current Topics Club (later the Blue Island Woman's Club), who was largely responsible for the founding of the Blue Island Public Library. Charles A. Seyfarth was one of the founding members of the Blue Island Elks in 1916. (The architect was himself apparently a person of catholic interests - he was an active member of the Poultry Fancier's Association during the time that Blue Island was the headquarters for the Northeastern Illinois Fancier's Association in the early years of the 20th century). From the time his grandparents arrived in 1848 to the time Robert Seyfarth left Blue Island in about 1910 for Highland Park, the village had grown from being a pioneering hamlet of about 200 persons to a prosperous industrial suburb with a population of nearly 11,000, which the noted publisher and historian Alfred T. Andreas Chicasaw County Genealogical Website - accessed 5/27/2010 had called \\"...a quiet, though one among the prettiest little suburban towns in the West\\". It was in this atmosphere that Seyfarth grew up, attended primary school, married his first wife Nell Martin (1878‚Äì1928), and built their first home.  Education and career   Chicago Manual Training School  The Chicago Manual Training School building, 349-353 (now 1154) S. Michigan Avenue (Solon Spencer Beman, architect - 1884). After CMTS was acquired by the University of Chicago and moved to its Hyde Park campus in 1903 the building was occupied by Dearborn Medical College and The University of Illinois College of Pharmacy. It is no longer standing. The World's Columbian Exposition under construction as seen looking east from the Illinois Central tracks at 61st St. The tracks would be elevated by the time the Fair opened in 1893. Seyfarth began his architectural education at the Chicago Manual Training School, which was founded by the Commercial Club (after 1907 The Commercial Club of Chicago) out of a concern for the quality of the education of skilled labor in the Chicago region. The school had opened its doors on January 4, 1884 with four teachers and seventy-four pupils and the support of the sixty members of the club who had \\"pledged themselves to found a manual training school, and guaranteed for its construction, equipment and support [with] the sum of one hundred thousand dollars\\". The club, which was founded in 1877, was a group of the city's most influential leaders that included Marshall Field, George Pullman, Edson Keith, Cyrus McCormick and George Armour. The club's successor, The Commercial Club of Chicago would later sponsor Daniel Burnham and Edward H. Bennett's Plan of Chicago (1909), which is widely regarded as one of the most important public planning documents ever created. Chicago Manual Training School was a private secondary school and was designed to graduate its students three years from the time they entered. The student body, which was all male, was required to spend an hour each day in the drafting room and two hours a day in the shop, in addition to the time spent in classrooms studying the conventional high school curriculum. In 1891 the tuition averaged $100.00 per year \\"to those able to pay it\\". SAGE - The international publisher of journals, books and electronic media. - Accessed 05/28/2010 In 1903 the institution became part of the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, operating out of CMTS (later Belfield) Hall. University of Chicago - Lab School Photo Archive - Students working at forges, 1904. Retrieved 07/10/10 Although it was to take him in a totally different direction, Chicago Manual Training School, with its focus on the industrial arts, was a logical choice for the secondary education of the oldest son of a hardware dealer, especially in an age when primogeniture was considered important. Besides his classes in drawing Seyfarth studied mathematics, English, French, Latin, history, physics, chemistry, foundry and forgework, machine shopwork, woodwork, political economy and civil government. He attended classes and graduated in 1895 with the son of Dankmar Adler, the son and the nephew of Henry Demarest Lloyd and with Henry Horner (1878-1940) who was the governor of Illinois from 1933 until the time of his death. Despite the fact that it was 17 miles away, Seyfarth enjoyed the advantage of the school's convenient location. The railway depot that marked the beginning of his trip was a two-block walk from his home at Grove Street and Western Avenue, with the end of the ride being at the Illinois Central's Twelfth Street Station, which was located directly across the street from the school. The ride would have taken him directly over the Midway Plaisance of the World's Columbian Exposition, where he would have a clear view to the west of the great Ferris Wheel and to the east of the Beaux Arts majesty of the main body of the Fair. It is difficult to imagine that to a boy from small-town America in the early 1890s this would not have created an impression and provided him with enormous inspiration, as it did the architectural world at large for the next forty years. In her book A Poet's Life - Seventy Years in a Changing World, the writer, founder of the magazine Poetry and social critic Harriet Monroe succinctly noted forty-five years after the closing of the Fair that \\"... like all great achievements of beauty, it has become an incalculably inspiring force which lasted into the next 'age'.\\"  The Chicago Architectural Club  Page 12 from the catalog of the Sixteenth Annual Exhibition of the Chicago Architectural Club (1903), showing Seyfarth's entry for a \\"Library\\". Seyfarth would later become a member of The Illinois Society of Architects, who by 1918 and thru 1928 would sponsor the exhibition in conjunction with The Chicago Architectural Club and The Illinois Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, with the cooperation of the Art Institute of Chicago. The education of an architect in the early years of the 20th century was quite different from what it is today, and the ambitious prospective architect could take many avenues to acquire it. In April 1905, for example, Seyfarth attended his first meeting as a member of the Chicago Architectural Club, which had been founded in 1885 as the Chicago Architectural Sketch Club by James H. Carpenter, a prominent Chicago draftsman, with the support of the magazine Inland Architect, whose first issue had been published in February 1883. The club was formed in Chicago during a period when architecture there was in its ascendancy - after the Great Fire of 1871 a large population of some of the country's best architectural talent had come to rebuild a modern city using the most advanced and progressive techniques of the day. Even so, the community was taxed trying to perform all of the work that was necessary to keep up with the task. Chicago was developing at a rate that astounded anyone who was paying attention to its growth, such that \\"one unfamiliar with the city would find ... fresh subject for astonishment, daily, in [its] ever-changing and ever- extending boundary lines.\\" As the Chicago architect John Wellborn Root recalled years later: > \\"The conditions attending the development of architecture in the West have > been, in almost every respect, without precedent. At no time in the history > of the world has a community covering such vast and yet homogeneous > territory developed with such amazing rapidity, and under conditions of > civilization so far advanced. Few times in history have ever presented so > impressive a sight as this resistless wave of progress, its farthermost > verge crushing down primeval obstacles in nature and desperate resistance > from the inhabitants; its deeper and calmer waters teeming with life and > full of promise more significant than has ever yet been known.\\" The club was an effort to help develop the talents of the city's many draftsmen so that they could become qualified architects themselves, at a time when a formal education for architects was generally unavailable and not required. (The first architectural school in the United States was founded by architect William Robert Ware at MIT in 1868 with nine students, and even by 1896, the year after Seyfarth's graduation, there were only nine schools in the country with a combined student body of 273.) Seyfarth joined during the time he worked for Maher, who over the years was an active member of the club as a speaker, writer, exhibitor and judge in its annual competitions. Seyfarth is known to have entered his work at two of these exhibitions \\\\- the first time in 1903 (before he became a member), when his submission was listed as a \\"Library\\", and again in 1905, where the subject of the entry was his own house in Blue Island. The preface to the catalogue of the 1905 exhibition was devoted to what the noted architect Elmer Grey (1872‚Äì1963) called \\"Inventive and Indigeonous Architecture\\", a phrase which perfectly reflected Seyfarth's design for this particular house and may have been one of the reasons why images of it were included. Because of his association with the Chicago Architectural Club, Seyfarth would have ample opportunity to become acquainted with the major players of Chicago's progressive architectural community, a large number of whom were active members. These were relationships that Maher would doubtless have encouraged. Notables among the list included Charles B. Atwood, Daniel Burnham, Dankmar Adler, Louis Sullivan, Howard Van Doren Shaw, William Le Baron Jenney and Frank Lloyd Wright. The club's headquarters for many years was located in the former mansion of the piano manufacturer William W. Kimball at 1801 Prairie Ave. in Chicago. It ceased to operate as an active organization in 1940 and was dissolved in 1967, but exists again today after it was re-formed in 1979.  Influences and early career  August Fiedler (1843-1903) George Washington Maher (1864-1926) The Liederkranz Hall in Blue Island was designed by George Washington Maher, and erected in 1897 at a cost of $8,500 to replace the club's building that had been destroyed by the Great Blue Island Fire of the previous year. It was dedicated on November 21, 1897 and was itself destroyed by fire on January 9, 1918. The William Weber house, 12956 Greenwood Avenue, Blue Island, Illinois. George Washington Maher, architect (1898). Weber was president of the First National Bank of Blue Island (later Great Lakes Bank, now merged with First Midwest Bank) and of the local board of education. He also served as a member of the Cook County Board of Assessors from 1898 to 1925, and six times as a delegate to the Republican National Convention. Weber had a connection to Maher's work on several levels - aside from his own home he was a member of the Blue Island Liederkranz, and through his activities with the Republican County Central Committee he had a close working relationship with Edgar J. Magerstadt, who in 1908 would use Maher to design the landmark home he built at 4930 S. Greenwood Ave. in the Kenwood neighborhood of Chicago. Weber was doubtless well-acquainted with the Seyfarth family. Sanders School, Blue Island, IL. William Weber was president of the School Board when Maher designed this building in 1900 during the time Seyfarth was in Maher's employ. This chart depicts the professional relationships through employment and mentorship over several generations that helped to shape the architectural philosophy of Robert Seyfarth. Anyone with even a passing interest in the architectural history of the United States will immediately recognize many of the individuals whose names are included here - names that constitute a list of many of America's most distinguished architects and innovative thinkers of the 19th and early 20th Centuries. Robert Seyfarth graduated from the Chicago Manual Training School in 1895, and literature published by the school shows his position upon graduation to be that of a \\"Draughtsman\\" for the Chicago architect August Fiedler. Fiedler was born in Germany and came to the United States in 1869, establishing himself first in New York City and then in Chicago as a much sought-after designer of high-end residential interiors, later becoming an architect. He designed some of the woodwork and other decoration for the Samuel Nickerson House (1879‚Äì1883) on Erie Street in Chicago (now the Driehaus Museum), and the interiors of the Hegeler Carus Mansion (William W. Boyington,1874‚Äì1876) in LaSalle, Illinois. In an 1881 letter to a colleague, one of Fiedler's contemporaries commented on the quality of Fiedler's design work for Nickerson by saying that \\"...it would be hard to comprehend its beauty without seeing it\\". From 1893 to 1896 he was the chief architect for the Board of Education for the city of Chicago (being the first to assume the position upon the creation of the building department on January 18, 1893), for whom he designed and/or supervised the construction of fifty-eight school buildings, and he was responsible for the design of thirty-eight buildings (thirty-six in the German Village alone ) at the World's Columbian Exposition . Seyfarth began his career as an architect at the age of 17 working for Fiedler during the time the latter was architect to the board of education, and records show his position at the time he was hired to be \\"messenger\\" (although, as noted above, his graduation notice suggested something more than that), for which he was compensated with a salary of $6.00 per week (about $168.07 in 2015). Fiedler operated out of offices in Adler and Sullivan's Schiller (later Garrick Theater) Building (1891, demolished 1961), and Seyfarth was almost certainly introduced to him through his uncle Henry Biroth, who was one of the earliest pharmacists in Chicago and served at various times as the secretary and president of the Illinois Pharmaceutical Association, which occupied offices down the hall from Fiedler.Report of the Proceedings of the Illinois Pharmaceutical Association at its Fourteenth Annual Meeting held in the Illinois Building, World's Fair Grounds, Chicago, August 16 and 18, p. 3 The Seyfarth family had been acquainted with Fiedler for several years before Seyfarth began to attend Chicago Manual Training School. Henry Biroth was an active member of Chicago's large ethnic German community, and in 1887, Fiedler (with his partner John Addison) had designed a house for him in Blue Island. How long the young Seyfarth worked for Fiedler and the board of education is not known (Fiedler separated from the board of education late in 1896, and was replaced by Normand Patton), but by 1900 he was working for George Washington Maher on the renovation of the interior of the Nickerson mansion for Lucius Fisher. Here, according to the Historic American Buildings Survey, he designed and carved the woodwork for the rare book room.Historic American Buildings Survey, Samuel M. Nickerson House, HABS no. ILL-1052, J. William Rudd, architect, pp. 3, 7. Maher was an influential architect associated with the Prairie School movement. According to H. Allen Brooks, professor emeritus of fine arts at the University of Toronto \\"His influence on the Midwest was profound and prolonged and, in its time, was certainly as great as was [Frank Lloyd] Wright's. Compared with the conventional architecture of the day, his work showed considerable freedom and originality, and his interiors were notable for their open and flowing ... space\\". Henry M. Hyde, in a 1913 article in the Chicago Tribune, recognized the work of Maher and of the other members of \\"the new American School of Architecture\\" by noting \\"They pay no attention to the conventions and rules of the classic types of architecture. They would express a new and democratic spirit.\\" He went on to say \\"...there is no doubt that just now the Chicago insurgents and their work is attracting more attention and causing more comment than any other architectural development in America\\". The residence of George B. Dryden (1869-1959), 1314 Ridge Ave, Evanston, Illinois. George Maher, architect (1918). Maher was not above providing a design for a building in a traditional style when the occasion called for it, and this example shows that his office was capable of executing well-designed work. In featuring this house in its January, 1920 issue The Western Architect magazine acknowledged that although the house was stylistically outside the realm of what Maher would normally be expected to provide, it noted that \\"He certainly maintains his faith in the \\"progressive\\" movement and will continue to work along such lines, believing, however, that no architect is capable of doing creative work who is not thoroughly well-grounded in the architecture of the past\\". This statement, if it accurately portrays Maher's philosophy, must have had a decided effect on Seyfarth's architectural development. The house still stands. Along with its coachhouse, it is divided into six condominium units.. The beginning of Maher's life, however, wasn't quite so auspicious. He was born in Mill Creek, West Virginia, and at about the age of five, due to the adverse economic conditions in Mill Creek at the time, his family moved to New Albany, Indiana. There Maher attended primary school, but by the time he was in his early teens the family was on the move again, this time to Chicago. They went there to take advantage of the prosperity that had come to the city after the Great Fire of 1871, and in 1878 George was sent to apprentice with the Chicago architect Augustus Bauer (after 1881 in partnership with Henry Hill who, with Arthur Woltersdorf would build St. Benedict Church in Blue Island in 1895) by his parents who, as was not unusual at the time, needed to augment the family income with the earnings that this type of employment would provide. As history would show, this turn of events proved to be fortunate for Maher. Bauer was considered to be one among \\"the city's prominent social and cultural arbiters.\\" He had come to the United States in 1853 having been a part of the wave of German immigration that had brought Robert Seyfarth's grandfather to the United States, and he and his various partners, who were also of German extraction, played an important role in providing architectural services for the large German community in Chicago during the second half of the 19th century. In 1869 Bauer designed the first German school in Chicago at 1352 S. Union Street for Zion Lutheran Church, and in 1872-73 Bauer and L√∂ebnitz designed Concert Hall, Chicago Turngemeinde (demolished) at Clark Street and Chicago Avenue. The output of the Bauer partnerships included many distinguished projects, including Old St. Patrick's Church at 700 W. Adams Street (1856, renovated and restored 1992-1999, which Chicago magazine ranked among the 40 most important buildings in Chicago ), the Rosenberg Fountain in Grant Park (dedicated October 16, 1893, restored 2004), and Tree Studios at 601-623 N. State Street (1894‚Äì1913, with Parfitt Brothers, renovated 2004). Bauer is credited with the invention of the isolated footing foundation system, which allows for a longer span between vertical supports. This innovation among other things permits the broad expanses of glass that have become a standard feature of modern architecture. Maher was not Bauer's only notable prot√©g√© - at the beginning of the Civil War and again at the end of it, Bauer employed Dankmar Adler (1844‚Äì1900), who would later work with Louis Sullivan on buildings that would come to be regarded as important contributions to the Chicago School of architecture, notably the Chicago Stock Exchange Building (1893, demolished 1972) and the Auditorium Building (1889) (now the home of Roosevelt University). How long Maher worked for Bauer and his partners is not known, but by the 1880s he was working in the office of Joseph Lyman Silsbee, who before he became an architect had been professor of architecture at the new College of Fine Arts at Syracuse University. Silsbee was a talented architect who designed in the latest architectural fashion. He was noted for his Shingle style buildings and \\"... was a master of the Queen Anne style, and in gaining the romantic effect admired by his clients he depended less upon [its inherent] chaos than his contemporaries\\". He came to Chicago in 1882 to act as an interior architect and as such was responsible for the opulent interiors of Potter and Bertha Palmer's fantastic castle at 1350 N. Lake Shore Drive (built 1881-1885, demolished 1950, Henry Ives Cobb (1859‚Äì1931) and Charles Sumner Frost (1856‚Äì1931) architects), and stayed to design several important projects for the city, including the Lincoln Park Conservatory (1890‚Äì1895) and the West Virginia Building and the Moving Sidewalk for the World's Columbian Exposition (1893). While he worked for Silsbee, Maher worked alongside George Grant Elmslie (1869‚Äì1952), Frank Lloyd Wright (1867‚Äì1959) and Irving Gill (1870‚Äì1936), who would each later become prominent architects, although with decidedly different architectural styles. In 1888 Maher established his own office with Charles Corwin, a relationship that lasted until about 1893. He briefly enjoyed a professional relationship with Northwestern University in Evanstion, Illinois, where in 1909 (during Seyfarth's tenure in his office) he designed Swift Hall and the first Patten Gymnasium (demolished 1940). These buildings were bold expressions of his unique design philosophy and were to have been integral parts of his master plan for the campus, which the board of trustees had commissioned through a competition in 1911 but failed to execute. This prompted one commentator in later years to lament \\"It's probably the most regrettable loss in Northwestern architectural history: the unique Prairie School campus that never was\\". Frank Lloyd Wright would have predicted the outcome. What follows is point 13 in his list of advice given \\"To the young man in architecture\\": \\"Enter no Architectural competition under any circumstances except as a novice. No competition ever gave to the world anything worth having in Architecture. The jury itself is a picked average. The first thing done by the jury is to go through all the designs and throw out the best and the worst ones so as an average, it can average upon an average. The net result of any competition is an average by the average of averages.\\". Toward the end of his life, when he was chairman of the Municipal Arts and Town Planning Committee of the Illinois Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, Maher became the driving force behind the restoration of the former Palace of Fine Arts, then a crumbling ruin which was by then the only major building that remained from the World's Columbian Exposition. In an article that appeared in The American Architect in 1921, Maher made the following observation, which indicates a predilection for classical architecture despite the conclusion one might otherwise come to upon examining his existing body of work: \\"For slightly over a million and a half dollars, Chicago could have, in perpetuity, one of the most beautiful specimens of architecture in the world ... It is universally agreed among architects, artists and critics, that the building is unequalled as a pure example of classical architecture. It is the last remaining memorial of one of Chicago's greatest achievements, the Columbian exposition.\\" Maher didn't live to see what he had begun come to fruition, but during the Century of Progress in 1933 the Museum of Science and Industry opened in the newly restored building, a project which was funded largely with a $5 million gift from the philanthropist Julius Rosenwald (1862‚Äì1932), who was president of Sears, Roebuck and Company. It is likely that Robert Seyfarth was introduced to Maher through family connections. Because Edward Seyfarth was an important local businessman, he would almost certainly have been familiar with the established architect's work that was being built in Blue Island.  Independent practice  This is the earliest known example of Seyfarth's work to appear under his own name other than his own house in Blue Island. It appeared in the May, 1905 issue of The National Builder magazine. Robert Seyfarth began to offer his services as an independent architect almost immediately after his graduation from Chicago Manual Training School. A late 19th century directory of Blue Island, published while he was most likely still working for the Chicago school board, contained a listing for \\"Robert Seyfarth, Architect\\" that showed the Seyfarth building (demolished 1992) as his address. After he began working in Maher's office his independent work began to show the influences of Maher and other Prairie School architects, and his earliest known independently attributed work comes at this time. In 1905 a \\"Neat Little Bungalow House\\" was published with plans, bills of material and estimate of costs in the May edition of The National Builder magazine. Seyfarth continued to work for Maher until about 1909, at which time he opened his own practice. In the early years the office was located in the Corn Exchange Bank Building (1908, Shepley, Rutan, and Coolidge, demolished 1985) at 134 S. LaSalle Street, which was a short walk from the Chicago Stock Exchange Building. Seyfarth was likely drawn to establish his office there thru the influence of his Blue Island neighbor Benjamin C. Sammons (1866-1916), who was the president of the Bankers Club of Chicago and a long- time vice-president of the Corn Exchange National Bank. Seyfarth later moved into the newly completed Tribune Tower (1925, John Mead Howells and Raymond Hood), where he had an office on the twenty-first floor until 1934 when the Depression forced the move of his business to his home in the North Shore community of Highland Park. His was a small office - he did the design, drafting and supervision work himself, and for many years was assisted by Miss Eldridge, who typed specifications and generally kept the office running. After the office was moved to his home, he took as his assistant Edward Humrich (1901‚Äì1991), who himself became a noted architect after he left Seyfarth's employ shortly before the advent of World War II. Humrich enjoyed a distinguished career designing and building houses in the Usonian style of Frank Lloyd Wright. He earned his architectural license in 1968. In a series of interviews with the Art Institute of Chicago in 1986, he summed up Seyfarth's appeal: \\"He had an excellent sense of proportion and scale. His houses were all true to the North Shore ..., and they're outstanding. He had a knack, kind of a freshness to it, and it was good.\\" The Art Institute of Chicago - The Chicago Architects Oral History Project, Edward Robert Humrich, p. 18. Retrieved 06/15/2010 A year or two after he went into independent practice, Robert Seyfarth built a gambrel roofed Shingle Style house on Sheridan Road in Highland Park, across the street from Frank Lloyd Wright's Ward Willets house (1901), and it marked a change in the direction of his design work - for the rest of his career his would design in an eclectic style combining Colonial Revival, Tudor and Continental Provincial elements with strong geometric forms. During his career Seyfarth would design 73 houses in Highland Park alone, where his output began before the time of his arrival as a resident and lasted until shortly before his death. Here he elected to ignore the notion that in later years was famously offered to young architects by the Sage of Taliesin \\"... go as far away as possible from home to build your first buildings. The physician can bury his mistakes‚Äîbut the Architect can only advise his client to plant vines.\\". Almost exclusively a residential architect with the majority of his work in the Chicago area, he also designed projects in Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Virginia, Kentucky and Alabama. By the end of his career, he had designed over two hundred houses. One of his more important works is the Samuel Holmes House designed in 1926 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A shingle style house overlooking Lake Michigan, its landscaping was designed by Jens Jensen. Robert Seyfarth continued to live and work in Highland Park until his death on March 1, 1950. The Chicago History Museum Research Center has an archive consisting of drawings for 70 of Seyfarth's projects dating after 1932.  Client base  Seyfarth is sometimes considered to be a \\"society architect\\", and an examination of the body of his known work will bear this out, but only to a certain extent. One client of this class, Willoughby G. Walling (1878‚Äì1938), of Winnetka, IL, is known to have mingled with European royalty and with at least one President of the United States in his capacity as the acting director general of the Department of Civilian Relief and as Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the American Red Cross. His brother William English Walling was recognized by W.E.B. Du Bois as the founder of the NAACP, and Willoughby himself \\"...became a major spokesman for the Chicago movement\\". Here he worked alongside the noted social reformer Jane Addams and some of Chicago's wealthiest and most influential citizens, including Mrs. Cyrus McCormick, Mrs. Emmons Blaine [whose father-in-law James G. Blaine was variously a Senator, the Speaker of the House and the Secretary of State for James Garfield and Chester A. Arthur] and Julius Rosenwald. The Jessie Sykes Beardsley house, 1918 (shown here c.1920), Freedom Township, OhioOther wealthy clients exported Seyfarth's talents when they built houses outside the Chicago area. Norman W. Harris (of Chicago's Harris Bank), whose intown residence was also in Winnetka, raised Arabian horses at Kemah Farm in Williams Bay, Wisconsin where his family lived in a \\"white cottage ..., one of the charming, low, rambling houses for which Robert Seyfarth, its architect, is famous.\\". Another such client was Jessie Sykes Beardsley, who returned to her husband's farm in Freedom Township near Ravenna, Ohio in 1918 the year after his death and built a large house (locally known as the Manor House) which was designed by Seyfarth that she had commissioned, presumably while she was still in Chicago. Here she operated the Beardsley Dairy for a number of years. Her husband Orasmus Drake Beardsley had been the secretary and treasurer of her father's Chicago-based company, The Sykes Steel Roofing Company, which made a variety of products including roofing materials and pool tables. While there, according to the 1908 edition of The Chicago Blue Book of Selected Names, the Beardsleys lived at 4325 Grand Boulevard (now King Drive) on a street that today contains one of the most intact collections of residences built in the late 19th century for Chicago's elite. The same book also shows that Orasmus Beardsley was a member of various prestigious clubs, including The Chicago Athletic Association (where William Wrigley Jr. and L. Frank Baum were members) and the South Shore Country Club (now the South Shore Cultural Center), where he associated with the likes of Clarence Buckingham, John G. Shedd, John J. Glessner, Martin Ryerson, Clarence Darrow, Joy Morton and Willoughby Walling. The Beardsley's Freedom Township house was later owned by Ohio State Senator James P. Jones. Another among Seyfarth's clients of this type was the mail-order innovator Aaron Montgomery Ward (1843‚Äì1913), who was briefly a neighbor after Seyfarth moved to Highland Park c. 1910. All of this notwithstanding, however, a careful analysis will show that Seyfarth served a broad-based clientele, and although he has a number of small houses to his credit the largest percentage of his work was done for what would be considered upper middle-class clients.  Marketing  This advertisement features the house at 1236 Asbury Avenue in Winnetka, Illinois, which was designed c. 1920. That Seyfarth was not averse to appropriating the elements of one project to improve the design of another can be illustrated here using the Baroque doorhead and pilasters surrounding the front door of this house. It was used at least one other time - on the house at 2500 Lincoln Street (1925) in Evanston, IL., where the house this time was finished with red brick and Colonial revival in style. Although un-attributed in this ad for the Arkansas Soft Pine Bureau, this is the Alexander Stewart in Highland Park, IL, which Seyfarth designed in 1913 (see gallery picture 10 below). The house of noted author and journalist Bert Leston Taylor in Glencoe, IL. In her memorial to Taylor (B.L.T.), Eleanor Jewett had this to say \\"...Among his proudest possessions was his home in Glencoe, Ill, a house of comfortable proportions ... this type of house is one of the most attractive that the North Shore boasts. It is, on the surface, a homey home\\". The photograph above is from her March, 1921 article, and first appeared in The Home You Longed For. It was also used in an ad for the Creo-Dipt Company.Advertisement for the Schick- Johnson Company that appeared in the December, 1910 edition of Architectural Record magazine. The company created the paneling for the Florentine Room, which Seyfarth designed for the north tower of the Congress Hotel in downtown Chicago. The building was designed by Clinton Warren and opened in 1893 as an annex to Adler and Sullivan's Auditorium Hotel (1889) to accommodate guests from the World's Columbian Exposition. In 1912 the Florentine Room was the site of discussions between Theodore Roosevelt and his opponents that resulted in the creation of Roosevelt's Bull Moose Party. During his career, Seyfarth's work appeared in magazines and journals and in the advertisements of various architectural supply firms. The extent to which this was done is not entirely known, but articles by Eleanor Jewett (1892‚Äì1968), art critic for the Chicago Tribune (\\"Cape Cod Architecture seen in B.L.T.'s Home\\" discussing the Taylor house at 92 Dell Place in Glencoe, Illinois) and Herbert Croly of the Architectural Record (\\"The Local Feeling in Western Country Houses\\", October, 1914, which discusses the Kozminski and McBride houses in Highland Park at 521 Sheridan Road and 2130 Linden, respectively) survive to give us some idea of how Seyfarth's work was received during the time he was practicing. (Croly would later go on to become the founding editor of The New Republic magazine.) Additionally, photographs of houses he designed appeared in The Western Architect magazine a number of times in the 1920s. Also surviving are copies of advertisements from the Arkansas Soft Pine Bureau (see image, right), the California Redwood Association (again with the McBride House), the Pacific Lumber Company (featuring the Churchill house in Highland Park at 1375 Sheridan Road), The Creo-Dipt Company (see image, left), the White Pine Bureau, the American Face Brick Association and the Stewart Iron Works Company of Cincinnati (with a picture of the H. C. Dickinson house at 7150 S. Yale in Chicago). In 1908, his Prairie-style house for Dickinson was published in House Beautiful magazine. In 1918, the Arkansas Soft Pine Bureau released a 32 page portfolio featuring houses built from Seyfarth's designs. Included were photographs, floor plans, bills of material, an estimate of the costs, and a brief description of important features. Entitled The Home You Longed For, the booklet was announced in Building Age Magazine under the heading \\"New Catalogs of Interest to the Trade\\". Although generally unavailable today, it must have enjoyed a wide circulation in its time. It was acquired the following year for the collection of the Carnegie library of Pittsburgh, and referred to that same year in an illustrated article that appeared in Printers' Ink Monthly entitled \\"The Loose-Leaf Portfolio - an Aid to Reader Interest\\", where it was described as \\"...a very attractive loose-leaf portfolio\\" and as a successful example of its type of publication. The last known example of Seyfarth's work to be published during his lifetime appeared in the September, 1948 edition of Good Housekeeping magazine. The \\"Little Classic\\" was an expandable ranch that the magazine had commissioned which it noted featured \\"...a cornice [that] is pure sculpture - no jackscrews of mingled mouldings [to] confuse its clean profile.\\" The illustrated article also pointed out that \\"...the porch at the head of the garden is reached through paired French doors from both the living and dining rooms.\\" \\\\- even in this late example of Seyfarth's work the abstracted design and covered exterior living space continued to be important elements of the composition. With a long history of having his work published, Seyfarth was following the example of George Washington Maher, who was widely published during his career. Articles by Maher and about him appeared regularly in publications that included Western Architect, Inland Architect, Architectural Record and Arts and Decoration.

Russell E. Q. Johnson house - 2730 Broadway Ave., Evanston, Illinois c. 1949, built 1956 Notes on the pictures * 1.) The first Robert Seyfarth house. This simple Prairie School house was built while Seyfarth was still working for George Washington Maher. The older architect's influence is clearly evident here, down to the use of a Maher hallmark, the lion's head, which appear here as brackets to \\"support\\" the second floor sleeping porch balcony. Seyfarth had used this feature shortly before in his design for the cabinetry and fireplace for the Samuel Nickerson house (now The Richard H. Driehaus Museum) at 25 East Erie Street in Chicago, which Maher renovated for Lucius Fisher in 1900-1901. A 1904 photograph in the collection of the library at Lake Forest College shows this house with the apertures of the sleeping porch only screened in the manner of the front porch of his second house in Highland Park, suggesting that Seyfarth also intended this building's now-enclosed counterpart on the Ellis house in Beverly to be open to the weather, as was the sleeping porch on the Dickenson house in the Chicago neighborhood of Greater Grand Crossing (see item #2 below). The photo also shows Seyfarth's use of a striated pattern in the shingles on the roof that Maher would use in 1907 on the Henry Schultz house in Winnetka, Illinois and the Kenilworth Club (in Kenilworth, Illinois), and on occasional other projects over the years. The house could be a study for the Ernest J. Magerstadt house which Maher built at 4930 S. Greenwood Avenue in the Kenwood neighborhood of Chicago in c.1908.The Library of Congress - Historic American Buildings Survey Ernest J. Magerstadt House, 4930 South Greenwood Avenue, Chicago, Cook, IL It appeared in the background of establishing shots in the 2011 New Line Cinema film The Rite, which starred Anthony Hopkins and Colin O'Donoghue. The Dickinson house as it appeared in an advertisement for the Stewart Iron Works Co. in the February 1909 edition of House and Garden. * 3.) H.C. Dickinson house. This is the first Robert Seyfarth house, writ large, in brick and stone. Although the sleeping porch on the second floor has been enclosed in a manner not in keeping with the style of the house, this house is otherwise also very similar in composition to the John Ellis \\"An Effective Use of Porches\\" by Harold T. Wolff, The Beverly Review. Retrieved 06/06/2010. house in Beverly Hills, Chicago (1908), which shows that Seyfarth, like many of his profession, felt free to copy himself to develop, refine or expand upon an idea further for another client when necessary. Note that the house retains the wrought iron fence that appeared with it in the 1909 ad for the Stewart Iron Works Co. (see left). * 4.) Kenneth Bullard house. The house is shown here as it appeared in the November 1912 edition of The Canadian Builder and Carpenter magazine. The picture and accompanying text were included under the heading \\"Two Prize Concrete Block Buildings ‚Äì Editorial Correspondence\\" as a result of the house's having won a competition sponsored by the Ideal Concrete Block Machinery Company of London, Ontario and South Bend, Indiana. The house was described as \\"An Artistic Bungalow constructed of stucco and concrete block\\", and a brief description was given that included its dimensions, number of rooms and structural details. It was noted that the house was completed for $6,500. Today it is remodeled beyond recognition. * 5.) H.S. Crane house. Maher's influence is clearly still evident in the design of this early house. * 6.) Maurice Kozminski house. Legion of Honour winner Maurice W. Kozminski was a mortgage banker with the Chicago firm Kozminski and Yondorf, and was the General Western Agent for the Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique from the age of 23 until 1916 when he was called to New York to assume the position of Director General of Passenger Traffic for the line. Pictures of the house appeared in Architecture magazine in 1917 and in The Architectural Record in October 1914. Here it was described as follows: > \\"...These [Midwest country] houses almost uniformly give the impression of > being built for people of refinement who take a keen interest in making > their homes attractive, and who have to that end sought the advice of > competent architects. One of the most attractive of these houses is that of > Mr. W. Kozminski, at Highland Park, Ill. Its architect, Mr. Robert Seyfarth, > has charmingly adapted the proportions and lines of an Italian villa to a > contemporary American suburban residence; a formal treatment model has been > converted into a comparatively informal modern residence, with a large > enclosed porch and with none of the landscape gardening which is ordinarily > needed to bind the house to the site.\\". The image above shows the house as it appeared in the article for The Architectural Record. It has subsequently been demolished. The second Robert Seyfarth house, 542 (now 1498) Sheridan Road, Highland Park, Illinois. 1911 * 7.) The second Robert Seyfarth house. The picture to the left shows the house as it appeared in 1911, before any additions were made to it by Seyfarth or subsequent owners. The picture above shows the house as it appeared in 1981 with changes made by Seyfarth - in 1920 he added the garage and the hyphen in between, and in about 1922 he enclosed the front porch, which runs across the front of the house and is screened in the 1911 photo. With the gambrel roof, wood shingle siding and other elements of traditional design, the house makes a distinct break with the stylistic influence of Maher. Today it has later additions that have been sympathetically designed to respect Seyfarth's original intention. * 8.) Daniel and Maude Eisendrath house. Daniel Eisendrath was a prominent Chicago surgeon and a professor of surgery at the University of Illinois. He was also a noted writer and the author of two textbooks on clinical anatomy and surgical diagnosis. The house was built in 1904 according to plans created by the architect Henry Leopold Ottenheimer (1868‚Äì1919), who early in his career had worked at the office of the celebrated Chicago architectural firm of Adler and Sullivan along with Frank LLoyd Wright. (Ottenheimer's time there may best be remembered by some as having been the person who stabbed Wright in the back with a drafting knife during a scuffle.). After time spent furthering his studies in Paris, Ottenheimer returned to Chicago and established his own practice, which operated under the name of Ottenheimer, Stern & Reichert. It was during that time that he persuaded the young Rudolph Schindler to come from Vienna to work in his office.The Society of Architectural Historians. 3/19/2006 \\"American Architect Biographies, Ottenheimer, Henry L.\\" Seyfarth was called upon by the Eisendraths to submit drawings to renovate the house in 1910, and the building permit for the work was taken out on April 30 of that year.The Chicago Historical Society - Index to the American Contractor's Chicago Building Permit Column, 1898-1912. * 9.) Samuel E. Thomason house. The composition and the stucco finish, casement windows, and tile roof shows that Seyfarth owes a debt of inspiration to Howard Van Doren Shaw for this Arts and Crafts design. * 10.) Alexander Stewart house. This house is seen by some as being among the architect's finest. With the imaginative use of traditional materials and non- traditional geometry, Seyfarth made the Colonial Revival his own. The house features a modern convenience that was a common feature in Seyfarth's frame houses in this style - the wooden shutters are functional and operate with a crank from the inside of the house. * 11.) 2064 W. Pratt Blvd. Note the symmetrical pavilions attached to the east and west ends of the house, a device used by Seyfarth a year earlier at the Alexander Stewart house in Highland Park (see gallery picture 10). * 12.) Lawrence Howe house. Here Seyfarth gives a nod to the New York architectural firm of McKim, Mead & White, and particularly to their forward-thinking early work, namely the Preston Hall Butler house in St. James, New York (by Stanford White, 1878, enlarged c. 1881) and the William Low house in Bristol, Rhode Island (1887, demolished 1962). McKim, Mead & White would soon \\"abandon simplicity and its hidden potential\\", but Seyfarth would pay homage to it here and for the rest of his career. The house is shown here as it appeared in February, 1920 issue of The Western Architect magazine. * 13.) 700 Greenwood Ave. Although not particularly large, this house presents an impressive fa√ßade to the street by virtue of its correct proportion, commanding front entrance, slate roof and lack of clutter brought on by extraneous detail that would tend to make the house seem smaller by breaking up its clean geometry. With the use of inverted dormers, Seyfarth is free to locate windows on the second floor without having to give consideration to the protuberances that would result with conventional dormers. * 17.) The Krueger Funeral Home. In 1913 Seyfarth had designed a house two blocks farther north on Greenwood Avenue for Robert Krueger, whose family had founded the funeral home in 1858. The funeral home was designed to look like a house to blend in with the residential architecture that surrounded it in Blue Island's \\"silk stocking\\" district. The Krueger and Seyfarth families were related by marriage. (The building was used inside and out in the 2006 Paramount Pictures film Flags of Our Fathers.) * 18.) Wagstaff house. In this house Seyfarth shows his affinity for the work of his near- contemporary Howard van Doren Shaw (1869‚Äì1926). In its geometry and with Seyfarth's usual simplification of exterior decoration, the house shares a similarity to the Hugh J. McBirney house (1908, 81 W. Laurel, Lake Forest, IL), which \\"...has more in common with the forms of the hipped roof houses of Wright and the Prairie School\\". The Wagstaff house also shares the enclosed porches that are an important feature of the McBirney house, and like it \\"...the house is almost devoid of specific stylistic elements\\". The first John C. Aspley house, 230 Fairview, Glencoe, IL. 1919. Demolished * 20.) John Cameron Aspley house. Aspley (1888‚Äì1969) was the editor of Sales Management Magazine and founder and president of its parent company, Dartnell Corporation of Chicago. In that capacity he was the author of a dozen books on the subject (some of which are still in print). The J.C. Aspley Award and Scholarship, for achievement and excellence in marketing, is named in his honor. He was also active in causes that promoted the public good - for example he served on the Advisory Committee for the College of Commerce and Business Administration at the University of Illinois, Transactions of the Board of Trustees - July 1, 1950 to June 30, 1952. Anthony James Janata, Secretary. Retrieved 06/22/2010. and was the chairman of the Wilson Avenue YMCA in Chicago. Aspley must have been a satisfied client. Seyfarth had designed a house for him at 230 Fairview Road in Glencoe in 1919 that appeared in The Western Architect the following year (see image, left), and an addition to the Dartnell Corporation building at R avenswood and Leland Avenues in Chicago in 1932. This house is one of Seyfarth's largest, and sits on a bluff overlooking Lake Michigan. The layout is such that most of the rooms face the lake. The house features the inverted dormer windows that are a hallmark of Seyfarth's work, and lannon-stone walls that are likely the work of Caesar Fiocchi, who was one of a small group of craftsmen that Seyfarth relied upon to interpret his work as he intended. Fiocchi would also have been responsible for the carving over the front door. * 21.) Arthur Seyfarth house. This house is another one that features operable exterior shutters. Note the original storm windows, which reproduce the pattern of the muntins on the movable double-hung sash. Note, too, how the inverted dormers here help to maintain the simple geometry of the building. To improve the proportions of this house's large living room, Seyfarth raised its ceiling higher than those of any of the other rooms on the first floor. He inserted built-in drawers into the exterior walls of the second-floor bedrooms beneath the roof to utilize what would otherwise be wasted space and so that the need of case pieces for the storage of clothing was virtually eliminated. This convenience was one that had been promoted by Frank Lloyd Wright in an article in The Architectural Record magazine in 1908 \\"...The most truly satisfactory apartments are those in which most or all of the furniture is built in as part of the original scheme ...\\". * 22.)

Johnson house Here Seyfarth embraced the ranch style floor plan with his own twist. The house is one of a number of the type that he designed beginning in 1936 (for Dougall Kittermaster at 1415 Waverly Road, Highland Park, demolished), the year before Frank Lloyd Wright drew up the plans for his first Usonian house for Herbert and Katherine Jacobs, which is credited with inspiring the craze for single- level living that lasted for nearly fifty years.  Demolition and controversy  The George Mahler house, Highland Park, Illinois. c. 1942 (demolished) The William Schreiber house, Blue Island, IL. 1950 Not all of Seyfarth's buildings have survived. One house at 67th and Yale was demolished in the late 1960s to make way for the construction of Kennedy‚ÄìKing College. The parking lot for the 6th District (Gresham) police station, built in 1997, occupies the spot where Dr. F.S. Tufts had built a store and offices (at 7754 S. Halsted St.) in 1909. At least one demolished house continues to live on, in a manner of speaking. Although it was a designated local landmark, the George Mahler house at 90 Ridge Road in Highland Park (1942) was demolished and replaced with a larger home, but its virtual twin still stands at 12857 S. Maple Avenue in Blue Island, having been built for William Schrieber in 1950, the year of Robert Seyfarth's passing. Ada Louise Huxtable, the Pulitzer Prize-winning architectural critic for The New York Times, made this classic observation about the phenomenon in a 1968 article she wrote about the demolition of Frank Lloyd Wright's Imperial Hotel (1923‚Äì1968) in Tokyo: \\"There is no art as impermanent as architecture. All that solid brick and stone mean nothing. Concrete is as evanescent as air. The monuments of our civilization stand, usually, on negotiable real estate; their value goes down as land value goes up. ... The logic and mathematics are immutable.\\" Most demolitions of Seyfarth's buildings fall into this category - they're torn down with little fanfare to be replaced by larger homes and buildings. There is one notable exception. The Hubbard/Brach house, which stood at 595 Sheridan Road in Winnetka, IL, was demolished in 2001 by a developer over the strong objections of local historians and the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois. The property had a hat trick in the arsenal for its defense that should have prevented it from being razed, but Winnetka had a weak landmark ordinance that required the owner's consent before a proposed landmark could be designated. The house sat on a three acre lot overlooking Lake Michigan. It was built c.1854, and in 1871 had become the home of Gilbert Hubbard, a founding father of the town and the developer of a large section of it that today is called Hubbard Woods. The house was sold in 1924 to Edwin Brach (an heir to the Brach's candy fortune), who with his family owned the house until 1999, when it was sold to George Garrick, who had become wealthy as an internet venture capitalist. At the time the Brach family bought it, the house underwent a significant renovation that was designed by Seyfarth, at which time it was extensively remodeled and increased in size to 11 rooms. All of this notwithstanding, Garrick felt the house had no architectural or historic value and his only apparent interest in the property was in the land on which it was located. Shortly after coming into possession of it he requested a demolition permit for the house so that the property could be sub-divided for two new houses. Without a strong preservation ordinance, the village was powerless to stop the demolition, and after fruitless attempts were made to come to some other accommodation the permit was granted and the house was demolished. In the end, Garrick never developed the parcel. The basement of the old house was filled in and the lot was allowed to return to its natural state. He later sold the property for a $500,000 loss and returned to California.  Salient features  Detail, front doorway of the Alexander and Sarah Colvin House, 5940 N. Sheridan Road, Edgewater, Chicago, IL. George Washington Maher, architect. 1909 The diagram above illustrates the difference between the amount of sunlight that penetrates into an interior space when an inverted dormer (top) is used compared to the use of a traditional dormer. Although considered a revivalist architect, Seyfarth's designs were not pedantic copies of existing work or even typical examples of the revival architecture that was popular at the time. Despite the fact that his design aesthetic was more traditional than that of his previous employer, Seyfarth had absorbed many of Maher's (and the Prairie School's) ideas and incorporated them into his own architectural philosophy. His buildings provided their owners with architecture that offered the most up-to-date conveniences and floorplans that were considered modern - but that was carefully imbued with the warmth and character of earlier times. From his introduction to The Home You Longed For - > \\"These few old world standards, rightly employed, have become completely > molded to fit our present conditions so that ... our modern examples are not > imitations, but rather developments of early principals ... With such a rich > inheritance handed down to us, why should not all our homes be of this sort, > examples of these splendid former types which were fashioned on sound > principles beyond reason for change of design and possessing an artistic > grace from which future generations may gather lasting inspiration - made to > live in and adorned to please - such should be the enduring qualities of the > typical American home of today.\\" Here he reiterated the thoughts that the architect and writer John Wellborn Root had expressed in a paper he read to an audience at the Chicago Architectural Sketch Club in 1887 that later appeared in The Inland Architect (February, 1888, pp. 3‚Äì5): > \\"Now, in America, we are free of artistic traditions ... A new spirit of > beauty is being developed and perfected, and even now its first achievements > are beginning to delight us. This is not the old thing made over; it is new. > It springs out of the past, but it is not tied to it; it studies the > traditions, but it is not enslaved by them. It is doing original work, and > it will do more.\\" Seyfarth's adaptation of \\"old world standards\\" to suit modern taste was done in several ways. First of all, Seyfarth flooded his interiors with natural light. What made this possible in the principal rooms of the first floor were the floor-length windows, which here and elsewhere were frequently wider than what might be acceptable to Palladio, but that were always in proportion to the building of which they were an element. On the upper floors where inverted dormers were used, sunlight is allowed to come directly into the room since the tunnel to the outdoors that is created by the ceiling of a convention dormer and half the area of the cheek walls is virtually eliminated (see image above - the angle of the sunlight as shown here is represented as it would be at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes in Chicago WGN Weather Center Blog - Sun Angle on June 21 at Chicago - retrieved 07/07/2010). Elsewhere, bays and banks of windows were frequently included to offer the same benefit. Another device that was sometimes used quite dramatically by Maher (see image, upper left) that is a signature feature of Seyfarth's work is the embellishment of the front door as the main decorative feature of the house, usually to the exclusion of everything else on the building. This allowed for the buildings' geometry and finish materials to speak for its architectural style, and act as a counterpoint to what was seen, especially then, as the fussiness of the architecture of the previous three quarters of a century. Here he was practicing what Root and Louis Sullivan had preached: > \\"The value of plain surfaces in every building is not to be overestimated. > Strive for them, and when the fates place at your disposal a good, generous > sweep of masonry, accept it frankly and thank God.\\" > ‚Äì From a paper read by Root before the Chicago Architectural Sketch Club, > January 3, 1887 and later published in Inland Architect. and > \\"...I take it as self-evident that a building, quite devoid of ornament, may > convey a noble and dignified sentiment by virtue of mass and proportion. It > is not evident to me that ornament can intrinsically heighten these > elemental qualities. Why, then, should we use ornament? Is not a noble and > simple dignity sufficient? ... I should say that it would be greatly for our > esthetic good if we should refrain entirely from the use of ornament for a > period of years, in order that our thought might concentrate acutely upon > the production of buildings well-formed and comely in the nude ... This step > taken, we might safely inquire to what extent a decorative application of > ornament would enhance the beauty of structures - what new charm it would > give them ... We shall have learned, ... that ornament is mentally a luxury, > not a necessary, for we shall have discerned the limitations as well as the > great value of unadorned masses.\\" > ‚Äì From an article by Sullivan entitled \\"Ornament in Architecture\\" published > in Engineering Magazine in 1892. Having worked in the frequently austere style of Maher for a \\"period of years\\", Seyfarth was ready to work with traditionally inspired ornament, judiciously applied. And as stylistically different as Seyfarth's work is from the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, Seyfarth embraced Wright's feeling that > \\"...We no longer have an outside and an inside as two separate things. Now > the outside may come inside and the inside may and does go outside. They are > of each other.\\" Seyfarth frequently designed outdoor living space that was under the protective roof of the house but exposed its occupants to the benefits of fresh air and sunlight (see gallery images 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 24, although some have been subsequently enclosed.) And the centrally located fireplaces that Wright espoused, along with their prominent chimneys, were to become a major feature of Seyfarth's work. One feature of the current age, the ubiquitous attached garage (the successful inclusion of which apparently continues to confound architects today), was frequently incorporated into the design of the main house with such skill one observer noted that \\"...Norman peasants must have been driving automobiles since the Conquest.\\" Significant works * Design for built-in cabinets and fireplace for the gallery of the Samuel Nickerson house, Chicago (Burling & Whitehouse, 1883), for Lucius Fisher,1900-1901 The Driehaus Museum - Explore the house - The Gallery.

It supports general aviation with no commercial airline service scheduled. History The airport was built in the 1930s as a regional airport in the Haute-Normandie, probably using a circular grass airfield, with airplanes taking of in any direction into the prevailing wind at the time of takeoff. German use during World War II It was seized by the Germans during the Battle of France in 1940 and was used during the German Occupation of France as a major Luftwaffe combat airfield. Its initial use was by Jagdgeschwader 2 (JG 2), in late June 1940 which was being rotated though several different airfields in northwest France flying Messerschmitt Bf 109Es. The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 Left unused for over a year while construction of concrete runways, taxiways and other permanent facilities took place, several bomber units Kampfgeschwader 30 (KG 30) with Junkers Ju 88As, and Kampfgeschwader 55 (KG 55) with Heinkel He 111H's used St-Andr√© for night bomber attacks against England from July 1941 until April 1942. Both were sent to the Eastern Front as the bombing campaign over England began to wind down. From July 1942 onward, St-Andr√© was used primarily as a day interceptor fighter airfield against the USAAF Eighth Air Force heavy bomber offensive over Occupied Europe and Germany. A succession of fighter units began using the base for interceptor mission in 1942, JG 25 and SKG 10, both flying Focke-Wulf Fw 190As until June 1943 when the base was temporarily taken off operational status for repairs and upgrades. St-Andr√© became operational again in late April 1944 with a series of units using the airfield with Messerschmitt Me 410As, Ju 88As, Junkers Ju 188A, and Bf 109G fighter interceptors until the Luftwaffe was driven from the airfield in mid July 1944 by the advancing Allied ground forces in the Northern France campaign. St- Andr√© was a frequent target of American attacks, being bombed on numerous occasions in 1943 and 1944. Also, USAAF Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolts attacked the airfield mostly with 500-pound General-Purpose bombs; unguided rockets and .50 caliber machine gun sweeps to attack the German interceptors on the ground. The attacks were timed to have the maximum effect possible on the jets to keep the jet interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. Also the P-51 Mustang fighter-escort groups of Eighth Air Force would drop down on their return to England and attack the base with a fighter sweep and attack any target of opportunity to be found at the airfield.Derived from information in USAAF film \\"Target For Today\\" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4) Allied use during World War II With German army units driven from the area, the USAAF IX Engineer Command's 877th Engineer Aviation Battalion moved into the area and began putting down concrete patches over the damaged runways.

Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . Current status The airfield was completely reconstructed after the war and today is a modern, provincial airport which is used for light aircraft. The airfield is home to a WWII aviation flying museum : Ham and Jam. Its wartime history is evident in the many relics remaining from the war. Both 5,200-foot concrete runways remain, abandoned since the war; the many concrete patches over the bomb craters left by American air attacks quite evident, with vegetation growing out of some. Many taxiways and aircraft dispersal pads can be found in the area, and the location of the wartime support facilities visible by the taxiways leading to their now, abandoned sites. Several wooded areas to the southeast of the airfield are connected by now single-track concrete roads; within them are likely many wartime relics of destroyed buildings and other facilities common to Luftwaffe bases of the era.

Occurrence  Olivetol is a naturally occurring organic compound. It is found in certain species of lichens and can be readily extracted. Olivetol is also produced by a number of insects, either as a pheromone, repellent, or antiseptic.Attygalle et al. (1989). Journal of Chemical Ecology.

Retrieved 18 January 2014 The cannabis plant internally produces the related substance olivetolic acid (OLA), which may be involved in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Synthesis of THC analogs Olivetol is used in various methods to produce synthetic analogs of THC.Adams, Roger University of Illinois One such method is a condensation reaction of olivetol and pulegone. In PiHKAL, Alexander Shulgin reports a cruder method of producing the same product by bringing to reaction olivetol and the essential oil of orange in the presence of phosphoryl chloride.Shulgin, Alexander T (1991) PiHKAL: 26 A method for the synthesis of THC itself consists of the condensation reaction between olivetol and Œî2-carene oxide. Legality The production, possession, and/or distribution of olivetol is not outlawed by any country; however, in the United States, it is a DEA watched precursor.https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/law_watched_chemicals.shtml Biosynthesis Olivetol is biosynthesized by a polyketide synthase (PKS)-type reaction from hexanoyl-CoA and three molecules of malonyl-CoA by an aldol condensation of a tetraketide intermediate. In 2009, Taura et al. was able to clone a type III PKS named olivetol synthase (OLS) from Cannabis sativa. This PKS is a homodimeric protein that consists of a 385 amino acid polypeptide with a molecular mass of 42,585 Da that has high sequence similarity (60-70%) identity to plant PKS's. The data from Taura's study of OLS's enzyme kinetics show that OLS catalyzes a decarboxylative-aldol condensation to produce olivetol. This is similar to stilbene synthase‚Äôs (STS) mechanism for converting p-coumaroyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to resveratrol. Although olivetol is the decarboxylated form of OLA, it is highly unlikely that OLS produces olivetol from OLA. Crude enzyme extracts prepared from flowers and leaves did not synthesize olivetolic acid, but only yielded olivetol. The exact mechanism of olivetol biosynthesis is as yet unsure, but it is possible that an OLA-forming metabolic complex forms along with OLS. In addition, it also appears that OLS only specifically accepts starter CoA esters with C4 to C8 aliphatic side chains such as hexanoyl-CoA.

They were highly valued for their rich timbers and intricate craftsmanship. Production of Ceylonese ebony and porcupine quill boxes was focused in three areas of southern Ceylon ‚Äì Galle, Matara and Matura ‚Äì all important trading posts, benefiting from the thriving export trade. The style of the boxes was very much aimed at the demand of the European market, boxes imitated traditional English forms such as jewellery boxes, sewing baskets and writing boxes. Although porcupine quill boxes were originally made for English residents, by the late 19th century, there was a thriving commercial export trade. The production of porcupine quill boxes and furniture falls between around 1850 and 1900. In particular there is one in the V&A; museum, which was given to Queen Victoria c. 1850.Amin Jaffa - Furniture from British India and Ceylon The number of ivory dots and their close proximity together are a good indication of a valuable box. The finest boxes from Galle may have an ivory disc positioned every on all of the ebony borders. By contrast a lesser box may have dots apart or more. Boxes from Matara often had two small dots directly above and below larger dots all around the border. The quality of the porcupine quills used is also a detail to look for. The porcupines quills can grow up to long, they naturally drop quills so they are easily collected by hand. The base is thick and it tapers to a fine and very sharp point, the quills are very strong and to be used in box production must be sliced in half length ways. Clearly, boxes with broader quills from cuts near the quill base are cheaper. Conversely those with fine quills are much more desirable and thus valuable. There are two types of quill, the first with distinct dark and white bands and the other with plain blond colouration. The coloured quills were used to make chevron patterns, whilst the blond quills offered a cleaner look. The most common boxes are up to in width, some have sliding lids and others are hinged with a lock on the front. Typically these boxes are not exceptional, however there is a small group of boxes from Matara that tend to be superior in the use of quills and ivory discs and these boxes command high prices. In general, boxes larger than wide tend to be superior, they were aimed at the more affluent client who could afford the extra time and attention to detail. The quality of timber used was not always very good, it typically was not treated or dried so the potential for warping is high.

It originally aired on November 2, 2009. Plot Future Ted describes new upstairs neighbours having loud sex on a regular basis, which he euphemistically describes as \\"playing the bagpipes\\". At MacLaren's with Ted, Barney compares his relationship with Robin to Lily and Marshall's marriage, contrasting Marshall's willingness to do chores for Lily with his own refusal to do anything he does not want to. He says that he and Robin never fight. When they disagree, Barney leaves or Robin distracts him with sex. Marshall arrives at MacLaren's, prompting a discussion about which of their relationships is better. Barney convinces Marshall he should stop doing the dishes. Robin arrives at the bar and confirms that she and Barney never fight, before leaving for a couples' skiing trip. Although Ted warns Marshall it is a bad idea, Marshall tells Lily he will no longer wash dishes. Lily is incensed, and they engage in a wildly escalating argument that ends with Lily kicking Marshall out. Marshall goes to stay with Ted, who notices that Barney and Robin have been acting suspiciously romantic. Ted suggests that Marshall do the dishes to keep the peace with Lily, but Barney disagrees, and Marshall and Lily's marriage continues to deteriorate. Robin arrives, and she and Barney call each other cheesy pet names. Ted remembers that Robin hates pet names, which makes him more suspicious that something is wrong. After another night of listening to his neighbors having sex, Ted goes to confront them, only to find they are very old and he does not have the heart to be angry with them. He goes to see Robin and Barney's downstairs neighbor, Phil, who has heard them fighting recently. Ted brings Phil to MacLaren's to meet Robin and Barney, forcing them to admit they have begun to fight. During their ski trip, they began to argue about Marshall and Lily's dirty dishes while stuck on a ski lift. Since they could neither leave nor have sex, it escalated into their first real fight, and they have not stopped fighting since. Robin and Barney explain to the group that they exaggerated their romance because they felt like they were a bad couple. Lily and Marshall forgive each other, which confuses Robin and Barney, who claim that someone always has to win an argument. As Robin and Barney leave, Lily and Marshall celebrate being the better couple. In the apartment below them, an old couple's chandelier is seen shaking violently, and bagpipes are heard. Critical response Noel Murray of The A.V. Club rated the episode with a grade B. Brian Zoromski of IGN gave the episode 9.2 out of 10.

It is located in the heart of Sinai Peninsula along the southern border of North Sinai Governorate with South Sinai Governorate. It is located at the skirts of El Tih Mountains and foothills at an elevation of . Coordinates of the city is 29¬∞54'N; 33¬∞45'E. Nekhel city is divided into 10 Markazes: Ras Naqb, Contilla, Sedr Elhitan, Tamd, Bir Grid, Khafga, Boruk, Netila, Ein Twibah and Assalam. History ;Pharaonic Era Nekhel was always part of the Egyptian Empire throughout history and it was part of the province of \\"Du Mafkat\\" in Ancient Egypt. Nekhel was the ancient capital of the entire Sinai province of Egypt, thanks to its outstanding strategic location at the exact center of the peninsula. In the 16th century BC, the Egyptian Pharaohs built the way of Shur across Sinai to Beersheba and on to Jerusalem. The region provided the Egyptian Empire with minerals, turquoise, gold and copper, and well-preserved ruins of mines and temples are excavated there. ;Islamic Era Being located on the new Hajj Route, Nekhel gained additional significance. In addition to its previous role as a strategic fort capital of Sinai. Hence, the city became a main rest and trade destination for Muslims who passed through the Hajj Route during Hajj season from entire Africa and Egypt towards Mecca for pilgrimage. ;Ayubi and Memluki Era During Islamic rule of Ayubid Caliphate and Mamluks in turn. Several Sultans built forts and castles in Nekhel to defend Egypt from Crusades of Middle East and Red Sea. Nekhel played a significant role as an influential military base for the Egyptian Army during Middle Ages in defeating Crusades and freeing numerous provinces of the Islamic Caliphate. Geography and climate K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies the town's climate as borderline hot desert (BWh) and cold desert climate (BWk). The mountain ranges of El Tih look at the city from different directions, with several valleys leading from the Mediterranean in the north, the Red Sea and Suez Gulf to the city and the mountains in all directions. The altitude of the city is about above the sea level, however nearby El Tih mountains are of higher elevation. Therefore, nearby foothills and mountains result in a cooler temperatures. The summer days are quite hot reaching , yet with moderate nights. At night, Nekhel is one of the coldest cities in Egypt, along with Saint Catherine and the mountainous provinces of Sinai. The area is very dry and averages less than 50 mm a year. Making one of the driest regions on earth. Although there are still many permanent water sources in the mountains, the area is continuously drying. The city also puts a great pressure on the water resources, as ground water in the valley is from the mountains. There is work under way to connect the city to the Nile via a pipe line. Practical Information Religion Nekhel was an important destination on the Hajj Route for Muslims from Africa to the cities of Mecca and Medina. Culture and Population The traditional people of the area are Bedouins whose culture is very similar to other Bedouin groups. Nekhel Bedouin tribes practice cattle breeding and agriculture which depends on rain and partially common snow. There are also Egyptians who live there and work in governmental sectors and public services. The techniques used are very similar to the Byzantine methods, partly because of the natural environment. They grow vegetables and fruit in stone walled gardens called bustan or karm, and mastered grafting where a branch of a better yielding low land variety is planted on a more resistant but low yielding mountain variety. Bedouin houses are simple, small stone structures with cane roofing, either incorporated in the garden wall, or standing alone a bit further up from the wadi floor, away from the devastating flash floods that sweep through after occasional heavy rains. Houses are often built next to huge boulders; natural cracks and holes are used as shelves and candle holders. Smaller rock shelters and store rooms are constructed under boulders and in walled up caves and are found everywhere in the mountainous area. You can see ancient leopard traps in many places. A goat was placed in as a bait, and the entrance was slammed closed with a big rock when the leopard entered. There are no more leopards left in Sinai; the last was spotted in the 1980s. In many places you can see big boulders with oval marks engraved on the surface. They are marriage proposal rocks, where a lover drew a line around his foot on the rock face next to his lover's foot print. If the two marks are encircled, their wish was granted and they got married. Wishing Rocks are boulders, usually a short distance from the main paths, with a flat top: if you throw a pebble and it stays on the top, your wish will come true. According to governmental plans, the population of the city is expected to increase. The increasing numbers of Egyptians living there will succeed in accomplishing that developmental national plan. Most of Nekhel's population is formed of Bedouins while the rest are Egyptians. Agriculture Agriculture in Nekhel depends mainly on water wells which are found basically in Contilla, Tamd, Bir Grid and Khafga. Additionally, rain and snow help on planting crops such as wheat, barley and corn. Variety of species of plants and crops grow in Nekhel. Mediterranean crops are the main agricultural products. Fruits include apple, almond, pear, apricot, peach, pistachio, dates and grapes. Wild walnut, mulberry and fig are grown in wild at the eastern portions of the city who get higher precipitation. Like other Mediterranean, Egyptian and North African cities, olives are very important in Nekhel, found in many locations. The gardens are usually built in the wadi floors in the main water course, and are encircled by massive stone walls. These walls have to withstand the regular flash floods, retain the soil - thus called retaining wall - and protect the garden from animals. Water wells are either built in the garden or a number of gardens have one but these wells freeze in winter and sometimes in spring and autumn. Today usually generators pump the water, but you can still see many shadoofs. Water is often found at higher elevations, either in natural springs or in wells made at dykes called jidda. The Bedouin built small dams and closed off canyons to make reservoirs. In either case water is channelled to small rock pools called birka, from where it was available for irrigation. Water was flown in narrow conduits made of flat rocks sometimes for kilometers -they are still visible but today gardens rely on plastic pipes (khartoom). Nature The city of Nekhel and the entire Central Sinai Region fall within the region of El Tih Plateau. It is a unique high altitude eco-system with many endemic and rare species. Some of the species are endangered, but there are many wild animals, birds, flowers to see. There are many Sinai Agamas, foxes, rock Hyraxes. Rock Hyraxes are frequenting gardens, and there is a wide range of migrating and resident birds from Europe. Also, there is a large number of feral donkeys in the mountains who migrate to the region and lower lying areas (reportedly as far as El Tur) in the winter and go back to graze for the more plentiful summer. Many of them belong to families and are stamped with marks. However, they put a big pressure on the eco-system. One of the principal goals of the Protectorate is to preserve the bio-diversity of the fragile eco-system, with an emphasis on the Nubian Ibex and the wild medicinal and aromatic plants. Rain and Snow are the best source of water, thus releasing water at a steady pace, replenishing the underwater catchment areas better. Water from rains flows down fast in the barren mountains, which may cause flash-floods and less water remains. The views from El Tih foothills are spectacular, and there are many other natural sights in the wadi system. There are springs, creeks, water pools, narrow canyons, steep wadis with huge boulders, amazing rock formations, barren plains with islands of lush vegetation. On the top of the mountains there are many interconnected basins with a unique high altitude ecosystem. Places of interest Nekhel is a great historical place with archeological landscapes and monuments in addition to pretty nature. Several Pharaohnic archeological sites are expected to be found nearby. The main attractions of the city are: *An-Nakhl Fortress of the Circassian Mamluki sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh al- Ghawri. *Fountainheads of Arish Valley which runs from the tops El Tih mountains and foothills. *Old Hajj Route. *Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri Carved Rock. *Metla Corridor. *Tih Mountains.

He was educated at Harvard University. His research interests include political history, legal history, and social history, as well as the history of medicine, race relations, and education. In 1981‚Äì1982, he was the Harold Vyvyan Harmsworth Professor of American History at Oxford University. Life Patterson was born and raised in Connecticut, son of J.

He then served for 6 months in the U.S. Army before taking a job at the Hartford Courant, where, he says, ‚ÄúI was responsible for writing 25 inches of news every day, and I learned to write quickly, using strong verbs, because I knew that the audience was made up of American adults at the breakfast table. This developed my style of writing, which seeks to be strongly narrative.‚Äù In fall of 1960, Patterson entered Harvard University, earning an M.A. in 1961 and a Ph.D. in history in 1964. He started his teaching career at Indiana University, moving to Brown University in 1972 until his retirement in 2002. His first three books (1967‚Äì1972) were \\"straightforward political history. I had always been very interested in politics before moving to academia.\\" For this work Patterson received the Frederick Jackson Turner Award from the Organization of American Historians (1966), two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He was also the recipient of an Indiana University Teaching Award and the Ohioana Award, a book prize for his 1972 volume on Taft. In the 1970s, Patterson noticed a trend away from the academic writing of political history and toward an emphasis on societal issues such as race, class, and gender. In keeping with this trend, in 1987 he published The Dread Disease: Cancer and Modern American Culture, chronicling the societal reaction to the disease from the 1880s to the 1980s, and exploring the social tensions and the persistence of fear caused by its specter, and how it reveals divisions in American life. In 1997, Patterson published Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945‚Äì1974, volume 10 of the Oxford History of the United States, covering political, cultural, and economic events of the postwar period through the resignation of U.S. President Richard Nixon. It was praised by historians and readers alike for its balanced commentary and readability. In his next four books, Patterson tackled the civil rights case of Brown v. Board of Education, the period from the Watergate era to the Bush v. Gore election of 2000, the Moynihan Report, and the seminal year 1965. Notable quotations ‚ÄúThe historian helps people understand the ‚Äòpastness of the past.‚Äô We do this with thorough research from original sources.

They differ from population projections as they are from past dates, although intercensal estimates can be used to form population projections.https://web.archive.org/web/20150319042522/https://www.census.gov/popest/methodology/2000-2010_Intercensal_Estimates_Methodology.pdf Postcensal estimate Intercensal estimates are one of the two types of population estimates, the other being postcensal estimates. Intercensal estimates are considered to be more accurate than postcensal estimates, because they approximated between two dates with the exact figure (accounting for errors) being known and being considered factual.http://www.ofm.wa.gov/pop/april1/dataqualproc.pdf Additionally, postcensal estimates can be based on the prior census. (e.g. a 2011 postcensal estimate can be based on a 2000 census, due to time and complexity of producing estimates from 2010 census data.). Intercensal survey All counts are estimates, including censuses (in reality every survey has a margin of error, even most census counts are corrected for data omission, duplication, cheating, miscounts) but some counts include random sampling (door to door and/or by calling) of actual residents rather than just producing figures based on mathematical models. These counts are called intercensal surveys. American Community Survey is one of these in the US, where a percentage of residents are called and asked to participate in a census-like questionnaire.

Allen (March 10, 1913 - April 2, 2012) was an American cyclist who competed at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. There he placed fifth in the Men's Team Pursuit, 4,000 metres event alongside teammates Eddie Testa, Ruggero Berti and Harold Ade. Born in Orwell, Ohio, his family moved around several times during his childhood, until they settled in California, where his father died. He was athletically active throughout school and took up an interest in cycling during his junior year of high school. After competing at the 1932 Olympics, he raced professionally until World War II. Allen served as an officer and teacher during the war and found work as an automobile salesman afterwards. He also volunteered at the 1984 Summer Olympics and remained athletically active into his 90s. From 2006 until his death he was the oldest living American Olympic cyclist. Early life Allen was born in Orwell, Ohio, the son of a baker. At the age of four he moved to Detroit, Michigan, where his father worked as an electrician until World War I. During the war, Allen's father re-enlisted in the United States Navy and, after the conflict, moved the family to Fort Worth, Texas to work at the automobile manufacturing plant for the Texas Star. When the company folded two years later they moved again, this time to Huntington Park, California, in the home state of his mother. He was the middle child of three siblings; his brother was born in Detroit and his sister in California. His father died early of alcoholism, leaving the mother to raise the family. During his school days, Allen participated in track and field and baseball before becoming interested in cycling during his third year of high school. As a freshman in high school he met future three-time American Olympian Frank Wykoff. He began training with the Crebs Cycling Club of Long Beach, California and Eddie Testa, who would later be chosen as one of his three partners for the Men's Team Pursuit, 4,000 metres event at the 1932 Summer Olympics. He quickly earned the nickname \\"Legs\\" while working out with the club. Cycling career After the Olympic trials, Allen was joined by Testa and two riders from the East Coast, Ruggero Berti and Harold Ade. The four members had only two weeks of daily training to prepare together for the 1932 Summer Games and continued training as the events commenced. When not competing, Allen had the opportunity to met Olympic champions such as Duke Kahanamoku, Paavo Nurmi and Jim Thorpe. The four Americans, who represented the first Olympic track cycling team for their country, ended up placing fifth in the Men's Team Pursuit, 4,000 metres event. After the Olympics, Allen began to cycle professionally and received contracts to race both nationally and internationally, which disqualified him from future Olympic Games. He soon became heavily involved in American six-day racing, riding in a total of thirty. When cycling, he used bicycles manufactured by the Schwinn Bicycle Company. He competed until 1940, when World War II broke out. Later life Allen worked at a defense job for the first half of the war, before joining the Navy in 1943. He traveled to Bainbridge, Maryland to attend Gene Tunney's school of athletics, and graduated as a Petty Officer Second Class. For the remainder of the war he taught naval air gunners swimming in Miami, Florida before moving to Corpus Christi, Texas to teach survival at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi. He married his wife Rose, a graduate of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the early 1940s and had three children: two girls and a boy. All of his children were UCLA graduates and his son became a family practitioner. After the war, Allen worked as an automobile salesman for Chevrolet and Cadillac until his 1962 retirement, at which point he took up golfing. During the 1984 Summer Olympics, which were again held in Los Angeles, he worked with the Helms Athletic Foundation to take disadvantaged children to the events and give athletic talks to junior high school students. He also participated in that year's Olympic torch relay. He has also distributed medals at the annual Jesse Owens ARCO Games. Widowed at the turn of the century, Allen remained athletically active, regularly participating in 50-60 mile rides into his 80s. In 2005 he participated in the Los Angeles Marathon bike ride. In 2006 he attended the funeral of John Sinibaldi, a teammate at the 1932 Summer Olympics. In his spare time, he enjoyed playing Texas hold 'em. Until at least 2006 he went bungee jumping yearly with his daughter in New Zealand and, in January of that year, he spent three weeks traveling the Middle East. From Sinibaldi's death until his own he was the oldest living American Olympic cyclist.

Frederick M Nicholas Archive http://frederickmnicholas.com/230_sports.html Arts Fred Nicholas became engaged in the pursuit of art in 1950 when he was a law student at the University of Chicago. What little spare time he had was spent at the Chicago Art Institute exploring the art of old and new cultures. Upon graduating from Law School, Nicholas took art courses at UCLA and USC. During his legal career, Nicholas represented numerous artists and art galleries including William Brice, Paul Kantor Gallery, Ernest Raboff Gallery, Margo Leavin Gallery, Frank Perls Gallery, Martin Lowitz Gallery, ACE Gallery, Harry Franklin Gallery and Felix Landau Gallery. Nicholas began collecting art in the 1950s and purchased contemporary and primitive art from dealers and auction houses throughout the country. He collected Rauschenberg, Warhol, Stella, Lichtenstein, Reinhardt and many of the New York School artists as well as Pre-Columbian, African, New Guinea and American Indian Art. His interest in art brought him to various institutions in the art field. Nicholas served the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles as Chairman for Five years, Vice Chairman for 4 years and serves as a Life Trustee. He was a Trustee of Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, now a Life Trustee; the Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation, and Frederick R. Weisman Philanthropic Foundation. He was the principal advisor to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Santa Monica Museum. He located the site for MOCA's Temporary Contemporary (now The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA) and negotiated a 99-year lease with the City of Los Angeles and MOCA. Nicholas hired Frank Gehry as architect and supervised the design and construction of the Building. He headed the architectural committee for the development of the MOCA building on Grand Avenue, supervised architect Arata Isozaki and was in charge of the construction project for 5 years. Nicholas served as the first Chairman of the Walt Disney Concert Hall Committee, guiding the development of the building. He created the program and architectural infrastructure for the Concert Hall including the selection of the architect, Frank Gehry and the acoustician, Nagata & Associates. He served as chairman for 8 years.Frederick M Nicholas Archive http://frederickmnicholas.com/400_arts.html Museum of Contemporary Art In 1980, Fred Nicholas was asked by his friend Max Palevsky, to help him with the various architectural difficulties he was having with the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. Palevsky had pledged $1,000,000 to MOCA with the understanding that he would head the Architectural Committee. Palevsky hired renowned Japanese architect Arata Isozaki but was unhappy with Isozaki's design. Palevsky felt Nicholas could resolve the myriad of issues pertaining to MOCA because Nicholas was an attorney and a real estate developer with broad experience in design and construction. One of the pre-eminent issues concerning the design plan was Isozaki's lack of experience working in the United States. Nicholas hired Gruen Associates of Los Angeles, to aid Isozaki in perfecting his design. Palevsky disapproved the final design plan and hired another architect to redesign the building. A dispute arose, and the Board of Trustees voted to approve the Isozaki design. Palevsky resigned from the Museum Board and filed suit to recover his pledge to MOCA. The litigation was settled and Nicholas took over the Chairmanship of the Architectural Committee. He supervised Isozaki and was in charge of the development and construction of MOCA for five years. Nicholas negotiated the lease between the City of Los Angeles and the Museum on the Grand Avenue site as well as the site for the Temporary Contemporary (TC). On behalf of the Museum, he hired architect Frank Gehry to design the TC. Nicholas supervised the entire construction project. The Temporary Contemporary (now the Geffen Contemporary) is widely regarded as one of the most important museum designs of the late 20th Century. With the goal of building a permanent collection for the fledgling museum, Nicholas, along with Museum Director Richard Koshalek and Chairman Eli Broad, negotiated with Count Giuseppe Panza of Varese to acquire the Panza Collection for MOCA. The Collection, which includes seminal works by Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Mark Rothko, Franz Kline and James Rosenquist, is considered one of the world's great private collections of contemporary art and forms the core of MOCA's permanent collection. Nicholas served as Vice Chairman of MOCA for 4 years and as Chairman for 5 years. He is now a Life Trustee of MOCA.Frederick M Nicholas Archive http://frederickmnicholas.com/410_moca.htmlhttps://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/10/entertainment/la- et-cm-moca-eli-broad-20120811 Sam Francis estate Sam Francis, a celebrated California color field artist, died November 4, 1994, and left a myriad of legal entanglements that lasted almost 5 years. Francis' original attorney was removed by the Superior Court and Nicholas was named Administrator With Will Annexed of the Estate in 1996. Nicholas negotiated for 2 years with family members and their attorneys before a Global Settlement was reached in 1998 and the claims of all parties were settled. The assets of the estate were divided equally among his heirs and the balance of his art inventory was transferred to the Sam Francis Museum, a foundation dedicated to the preservation of the artwork and legacy of Sam Francis. During his tenure as administrator of Sam Francis' Estate, Nicholas arranged a comprehensive one-man show of Francis' art at MOCA. The show traveled to the Reina Sofia in Madrid; Museum of Modern Art in Rome; and the Contemporary Museum of Stockholm. He placed Francis' work in numerous gallery shows throughout the United States, including Ace Gallery, Beverly Hills; Gagosian Gallery, New York; Gallery Delaive, Amsterdam; Art in Embassies Program, US State Department; Greenberg Van Doren Gallery, New York; Manny Silverman Gallery, Los Angeles; Andr√© Emmerich Gallery, New York; Gemini Gel, Los Angeles; Baukust Galerie, Cologne; Thomas Segal Gallery, Baltimore; Alan Christea Gallery, London; Gallerie Jean Fournier, Paris; Galerie Pro Arta, Zurich; Galerie Kornfeld, Bern; Richard Gray Gallery, Chicago; Jonathan Novak Gallery, Los Angeles; Bobbie Greenfield Gallery, Los Angeles; Leslie Sacks Fine Arts, Los Angeles; Long Fine Arts, New York; Gallery Maurice, Massachusetts.Frederick M Nicholas Archive http://frederickmnicholas.com/420_samfrancis.html Walt Disney Concert Hall In the late 1980s, Mrs. Walt Disney gave the Music Center of Los Angeles, a gift of $50,000,000 to build a Concert Hall honoring her husband Walt Disney in Downtown, Los Angeles. In 1987, Dan Frost, Chairman of the Music Center chose Frederick M. Nicholas to head the Walt Disney Concert Hall Committee and undertake the development of a concert hall at 1st and Grand Avenue in Los Angeles. Nicholas at the time was the newly elected Chairman of the Museum of Contemporary Art and accepted the new position only after assurances from Mrs. Disney that she wanted a world-class design with great acoustics. Nicholas and his staff planned the program for the construction of Disney Hall, chose the architect and acoustician and guided the design. He spent 8 years on the project pro-bono.Frederick M Nicholas Archive http://frederickmnicholas.com/430_waltdisneyhall.html Art Center College of Design Fred Nicholas has been trustee of Art Center College of Design for approximately 8 years, having joined the Board at the request of Richard Koshalek, his longtime friend and former Director of the Museum of Contemporary Art where Nicholas serves as a Life Trustee. Nicholas' role at Art Center has been to help develop the recently completed downtown campus and to negotiate with the City of Pasadena for a long- term lease on the City's neighboring Power Plant. In addition Nicholas is aiding in the development of Student Housing for the downtown campus.Frederick M Nicholas Archive http://frederickmnicholas.com/440_artcenter.html Professional The professional career of Fred Nicholas spans over 5 decades commencing in 1952 when he was admitted to the California Bar Association.http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Member/Detail/23451 Nicholas practiced Real Estate Law for more than 50 years. During that time he became involved in a myriad of related activities including his founding of Public Counsel, the largest pro-bono law firm in the world; representing Synanon, a self-help organization of former drug addicts; developing numerous shopping centers and office tower complexes in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles; and activism in National and Statewide Democratic Politics.Frederick M Nicholas Archive http://frederickmnicholas.com/300_prof.html Law In 1952, Fred Nicholas was sworn in as a lawyer in California, and started his legal career at Loeb & Loeb in Los Angeles. He practiced law with Loeb & Loeb for 5-1/2 years, and left to form a law firm with Harry Swerdlow and William Glikbarg. The firm, called Swerdlow, Glikbarg & Nicholas, specialized in contract and antitrust law. Nicholas remained at SG&N; for 6 years, and then formed his own law firm specializing in real estate law. He remained an active attorney until 1980 when he became a full-time real estate developer. Nicholas still retains his license to practice law in California. Public Counsel In 1968, Fred Nicholas was named by the president of the Beverly Hills Bar Association, Chairman of a Committee on the Future of the Bar. It was at this time that Ralph Nader was a guest speaker at a Beverly Hills Bar Association lunch and spoke about the responsibilities of lawyers to the community. He criticized the legal profession for ‚ÄúNot Giving Back‚Äù. This message hit a nerve with Nicholas and he suggested to members of his Committee that the Beverly Hills Bar Association sponsor a pro-bono law firm to provide free legal services to the poor and needy. After two years of debate, the Beverly Hills Bar Association in 1970 authorized the formation of a pro-bono law firm under the name of Beverly Hills Bar Association Law Foundation. The Bar donated $5000 to its formation and Fred Nicholas was the first president with a staff of Stanley Levy as the first director and Ann Dominique Snyder as assistant. The fledgling organization survived on a donation of $20,000 from Nicholas and small gifts from the large Beverly Hills law firms. After the birth of the Beverly Hills Bar Association Law Foundation, the most important event in its history was the joining in 1975 of the Los Angeles County Bar Association in co-sponsoring the foundation and the changing of its name to Public Counsel. Today Public Counsel is the largest pro-bono law organization in the World, helping more than 25,000 individuals and entities each year. The value of its yearly services is more than $45 million. Nicholas was awarded the Founders Award in 1990 by Public Counsel, and the Lloyd C. Cutler Lifetime Achievement Award from the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law in 2008.Frederick M Nicholas Archive http://frederickmnicholas.com/320_publiccounsel.html Synanon Synanon was a self-help society formed by ex-dope addicts, ex- criminals and ex-prostitutes in 1959 and led by an ex-alcoholic named Charles Dederich. Fred Nicholas became Dederich's and Synanon's pro-bono lawyer in 1960 through Jack Roberts, a dear friend of Nicholas. Nicholas represented Synanon in a myriad of legal problems from zoning violations, litigation and real estate acquisitions for a period of 8 years including the Synanon acquisition of the Del Mar Beach Club in Santa Monica and the Synanon ranch in Tomales Bay. Dederich referred to Nicholas as his \\" Battery of Attorneys\\". Nicholas severed his relationship with Synanon when the organization became militant in 1968. Three books have been written about Synanon and Nicholas' role with the Organization, \\"The Tunnel Back: Synanon\\" by Lewis Yablonsky (1964);\\"Synanon\\" by Guy Endore (1968).;Frederick M Nicholas Archive http://frederickmnicholas.com/330_synanon.html From Miracle to Madness: True Story of Charles Dederich and Synanon (2015) https://www.amazon.com/Miracle- Madness-2nd-Charles- Dederich/dp/0578163055/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1508722156&sr;=1-2&keywords;=synanon Real estate Fred Nicholas started in the real estate business in 1956 when he met Maurice O. Smith (Hap Smith) a real estate broker who was involved in minor real estate transactions in the west side of Los Angeles. Hap Smith was referred to Nicholas as a real estate attorney at Loeb & Loeb. He needed a lawyer to prepare an option agreement for real property in Fremont, California. Hap Smith was unable to pay for the legal work and as a result Loeb & Loeb refused to accept him as a client. Nicholas and Hap Smith became immediate friends and Nicholas prepared the option agreement on his free time without charge. Smith also was unable to raise the down payment for the option agreement and Nicholas raised the funds among his family and friends. Hap Smith invited Nicholas to become his partner and they formed a partnership known as The Hapsmith Company in 1956 because Nicholas was practicing law and did not want his name on the partnership. The Hapsmith Company's first project was the development of a community shopping center in Fremont California with the second Mervyns store ever built as the one anchor tenant and Sears as the other. The Center was a success and expanded into phase II. After many years of operation, the Center was exchanged for a 50% interest in a twin AMFAC tower office complex in downtown Honolulu, which The Hapsmith Company owned and operated for more than 10 years. Other real estate projects followed in rapid order; Eastridge Shopping Center in San Jose; Tanforan Park in San Bruno, CA; Montebello Mart, CA; Brea-Imperial Shopping Center, Brea, CA; Norwood Shopping Center in Sacramento, CA; Union Bank Center, Los Angeles, CA; Weberstown Shopping Center in Stockton, CA; Stimson Business Center, Los Angeles, CA; Wilshire Rexford Building, Beverly Hills, CA; The SuperMall of the Great Northwest in Auburn, WA; the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington D.C. and the Culver Center, in Culver City, CA. Hap Smith died in 1975, and Nicholas formed a corporation called The Hapsmith Company and continued to develop and own shopping centers, which the company has done since 1956.Frederick M Nicholas Archive http://frederickmnicholas.com/340_realestate.html Awards Involvements EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE LAWYERS' COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS UNDER LAW, Washington D.C. - Member FUND FOR THE REPUBLIC AND THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS - Trustee PITZER COLLEGE (Claremont) - Trustee ACLU FOUNDATION - Director LOS ANGELES MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART - Former Chairman of the Board of Trustees LOS ANGELES TASK FORCE ON ART - Member SPECIAL ADMINISTRATOR TO THE ESTATE OF SAM FRANCIS FREDERICK R.

He was allegedly kidnapped and murdered by henchmen of Rafael Trujillo, the dictator of the Dominican Republic. Early life Gal√≠ndez was born in Amurrio, and, as a Basque Nationalist Party member, took part on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. In 1939 he fled to Ciudad Trujillo, now Santo Domingo, where he lectured and represented the Basque government as a delegate. He started to investigate Trujillo and his government, encountered problems, and fled again, moving to New York City in 1946. Through the network he met with Ibero-American Poets, the Writers Guild, the International League for the Rights of Man, and the Inter-American Association for Democracy and Freedom. At Columbia University, he lectured on international law and completed his doctoral thesis about Trujillo and his rule. Gal√≠ndez allegedly became an informant for the FBI. Disappearance Gal√≠ndez was last seen at 10 PM on March 12, 1956, as he entered the subway station at 57th Street and 8th Ave in Manhattan. TIME magazine indicated that he disappeared near a subway station at 116th Street and Broadway. It was well known that Gal√≠ndez feared that Dominican agents might kill him. On the night of his death, two Dominican ships were in New York; one put out that night and returned after 5 hours, the other leaving later. However, investigations initially went nowhere. His body was never found, but the unraveling of the Murphy disappearance allowed further light to be shed on his case. Murphy case Gerald Lester Murphy was an American airline pilot for the Dominican airline, CDA. On December 4, 1956, his car was found abandoned near Ciudad Trujillo, without a trace of him. Under pressure from relatives, their Congressional representatives, and the US State Department, the Dominican government got into the picture. It was suggested that Octavio de la Maza, also a pilot with CDA, and Murphy had a brawl, and Murphy fell from a cliff into the ocean. De la Maza was arrested and jailed but refused to admit any involvement. On January 7, 1957, he was found hanging in his cell with a suicide note and an admission of involvement. However, circumstances of his \\"suicide\\" implied that it was staged and his note was declared a forgery by the FBI. The trial in the US of John J. Frank in November 1956 as an unregistered agent for the Dominican government provided further insights into the Gal√≠ndez‚ÄìMurphy connection. He stated that Gal√≠ndez had been under Dominican supervision for some time, and it was feared that he was writing a critical volume about Trujillo and his family. Agents offered US$25,000 () to buy the manuscript, but Gal√≠ndez refused. Thus, Trujillo decided that Gal√≠ndez had to be killed. A plan was hatched to use an American pilot, Murphy, who rented a Beech aircraft, equipped it for long distance flight and landed on March 12 in Amityville. In the night, an ambulance arrived and a \\"patient\\" was moved on the airplane. The plane, piloted by Murphy, flew to West Palm Beach to refuel. Then, Murphy flew to the Dominican Republic with the \\"patient,\\" who then disappeared. Murphy initially had plenty of money but may have talked too much and disappeared. It is alleged that Gal√≠ndez was the \\"patient.\\" Consequences De la Maza's death created a friction between Trujillo and his son Ramfis who had been a close friend to de la Maza. In the US, Trujillo hired Sydney S. Baron and Co. to counteract the negative publicity and reactions that the case had evoked. Baron hired Morris Ernst to investigate the Gal√≠ndez disappearance. With the help of the Dominican government, they produced a report in May 1958 that whitewashed the Dominican government of any involvement. Nevertheless, Crassweller sees the Gal√≠ndez case as one factor in the deteriorating relationship between the United States and Trujillo. The brother of Octavio de la Maza, Antonio de la Maza, later became one of the assassins of Trujillo. Literature and movies Gal√≠ndez's book, La era de Trujillo: un estudio casu√≠stico de dictadura hispanoamericana, was published in Buenos Aires and Santiago de Chile in 1956, a few months after his disappearance. Translations were later published in France.L'√àre de Trujillo. Anatomie d'une dictature latino-am√©ricaine, Gallimard, 1962. and in the United States.The Era of Trujillo, Dominican Dictator, University of Arizona Press, 1973. , . The Gal√≠ndez case inspired the 1961 novel Ciudad Trujillo by Andrzej Wydrzy≈Ñski, a Polish novelist.Ciudad Trujillo , . The Gal√≠ndez case also inspired the 1991 novel Gal√≠ndez by Manuel V√°zquez Montalb√°n, which led to the 2003 movie El Misterio Gal√≠ndez (The Gal√≠ndez File). In 2002 Ana Diez directed the documentary Gal√≠ndez about the affair. In his book The Feast of the Goat, Mario Vargas Llosa talks at length about Gal√≠ndez and his disappearance. Junot D√≠az briefly relates the Gal√≠ndez case in a footnote to his novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. Julia Alvarez references the disappearance of Gal√≠ndez in her novel In the Time of the Butterflies during a section from Maria Teresa's perspective.

Martha L. Black also provides icebreaking services to the same areas. In 2012, the ship transported scientists on a research mission to the Labrador Sea. In January 2014, Martha L. Black was one of two icebreakers called into the Saint Lawrence River to aid two passenger ferries which were prevented from crossing the river by ice. The ferries, which connect the Quebec communities of Sorel-Tracy and Saint-Ignace-de-Loyola, had been docked after ice conditions had become severe enough that the large icebreaker needed reinforcement. In 2016, Martha L. Black suffered damage to her three engines and remained out of service for three months, docked at Cacouna, Quebec.

Career Laurentz achieved his breakthrough in April 1911 at age 16 when he defeated the Wimbledon champion Anthony Wilding in the final of the French Covered Court Championships in Paris. In March 1912 he was playing in the Challenge Round of the Championship of France against Andre Gobert when at 2‚Äì4 in the first set a ball that glanced off his racket struck him in the eye. Subsequently, the eye had to be removed. He notably won the mixed doubles at the French Championships in 1912 and 1913, when the tournament was open only to French residents, and the singles at the International Lawn Tennis Federation's (ILTF) 1920 World Hard Court Championships (WHCC). In the final of the latter, played on clay courts at the Stade Fran√ßais in Paris, he beat Andre Gobert in four sets. Together with Gobert he additionally won the men's doubles title at the WHCC in 1920 and 1921. In 1921 he won the singles title at the World Covered Court Championships (WCCC), played in Copenhagen on an indoor wood surface, beating Alfred Beamish in the final in straight sets. Laurentz participated at the Wimbledon Championships for the first time in 1919, losing in straight sets in the first round to Algernon Kingscote. His best Wimbledon result came the following year, 1920, when he reached the third round in which he was defeated by his compatriot Jacques Brugnon in four sets. He was entered for the 1921 Championships but withdrew before his first round match against Andre Gobert. He was ranked World No. 8 for 1920 by A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph.United States Lawn Tennis Association (1972). Official Encyclopedia of Tennis (First Edition), p. 422. Between 1912 and 1921 he played in five ties for the French Davis Cup team and has a record of three wins and seven defeats. Laurentz died suddenly in Paris on 7 March 1922 of septicaemia following upon influenza. Playing style In his book The Art of Lawn Tennis (1920) Bill Tilden described Laurentz as \\"another brilliant, erratic and intensely interesting figure that France has given the tennis world...\\" who played mostly by instinct. Tilden describes Laurentz' service as one of \\"several varieties, all well played. He uses an American twist as his regular delivery, but varies it with a sharp slice, a reverse twist of great spin, and a fast cannon-ball smash.\\" His volleying was \\"brilliant...but very erratic\\" and his overhead smashes were judged likewise. He had great fighting skills and played at his best when behind but was prone to anxiety lapses. Tilden concludes that \\"Laurentz might beat anyone in the world on his day or lose to the veriest dub when at his worst.\\".

Biography Born in Artvin, Turkey, in 1950, he graduated from the Management Department of Boƒüazi√ßi University. He began work in the finance sector in 1974 and was chairman of Yapi Kredi Bank, chairman of Turkey's largest Internet company Superonline from its inception in 1994 and executive board director of the YKY (Yapƒ± Kredi Publications), where he amassed a personal library of 9,000 volumes and published works by Louise Gluck and John Ashbery, before he retired in 2004 to pursue his writing career full-time. ‚ÄúMy goal was to write a book by the age of 50‚Äù, he says. ‚ÄúBefore that, I knew I needed to read, so I read some 4,000 books before I sat down to write. That, more than anything, gave me the confidence I needed.‚Äù His first novel Yalnƒ±zlƒ±k Gittiƒüin Yoldan Gelir (Loneliness Comes from the Road You Go Down) was published in 2001 and has been subsequently followed by four further novels, a book of essays and a regular monthly column titled Kitap Icin (For The Love Of Books) in the Cumhuriyet. ‚ÄúI regard myself as a ‚Äòperson who writes‚Äô rather than a ‚Äòwriter,‚Äô‚Äù the author told Today's Zaman, ‚ÄúI do not make a living on what I receive from my books. I transfer all royalties from my books to a scholarship fund I've founded at the university I graduated from. It provides scholarships to successful university students who study literature.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn any case, Whenever I want to write, I feel the urge to read first.‚Äù ‚ÄúI believe that in both Turkish and world literature, bibliophilic protagonists and narrators in particular do not appear as much as they should,‚Äù states the self-confessed bibliophile, who maintains he reads far more than he writes, ‚ÄúBesides, these characters do not like showing up in trashy novels that sweep the book market. Yet I believe the elite group called ‚Äòliterary readers‚Äô do embrace them.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn my novels, the setting is as important as the central characters. For this reason, I go on special voyages. These voyages nurture me; each time, I set on the road wondering how that particular voyage will nurture me.‚Äù In order to bring his books to an international audience, the author himself paid for the English translation of his fourth novel Songs My Mother Never Taught Me. This translation, by Ruth Christie and Sel√ßuk Berilgen, was published Telegram Books in 2008 and sold 3,000 copies in the UK, but while the English publisher opted to follow it with Many and Many a Year Ago in 2009 and various German, Swiss, Spanish and Portuguese houses have expressed an interest in buying rights, ‚Äúthe global economic crisis seems to have stopped the process‚Äù, and, ‚ÄúThree foreign publishing houses acquired the rights to publish Songs My Mother Never Taught Me, but that was it!‚Äù ‚ÄúThere are many reasons for the limited number of Turkish authors and poets translated into English,‚Äù Altun stated in an interview with The Guardian, ‚ÄúSadly Nobel prize-winner Orhan Pamuk's success hasn't yet increased Anglo-American interest in Turkish authors and poets,‚Äù before going on to list works by Feyyaz Kayacan Fergar, Oktay Rifat, Ya≈üar Kemal, Sait Faik, Bilge Karasu, Ahmet Hamdi Tanpƒ±nar, Nazƒ±m Hikmet as well as Pamuk among his top 10 Turkish books.
