The Network is a project of the German Mennonite Peace Committee (Deutsches Mennonitisches Friedenskomitee, DMFK) and is located in Bammental, Germany in the DMFK offices. MCN is part of the GI Rights Network. MCN exists as a source of information concerning a wide range of regulations and discharges, such as conscientious objection, medical, and hardship to U.S military members stationed in Europe. Counselors do not provide legal advice, but can assist callers in finding lawyers in their area who can give them appropriate advice.  History  In September 1986, Bill Boston created the ‘Military Counseling Project – Mutlangen’ in West Germany, offering an independent source of information about GI rights and discharge possibilities for US servicemembers. In the Fall of 1987, Janice Hill and Andre Gingerich Stoner joined with Boston and created the ‘Military Counseling Network.MCC Peace Office Newsletter: Military Counseling Network: Helping Military Sevicemembers Lay Down Their Arms MCC Peace Office Newsletter . The first mission statement read: Presently more than 250,000 members of the US military and their families and US civilian employees are stationed in the Federal Republic of Germany. Many of them suffer violations of rights and face conflicts of conscience and other difficulties within the military. The Military Counseling Network advises US soldiers free of charge about their rights under military law and can assist them in achieving various discharges (conscientious objection, medical, hardship, etc.). The network of trained civilian counselors was established because soldiers are often poorly informed of their rights and until now had no source of assistance in Germany outside of the military. The network also seeks to build bridges and foster dialogue between US soldiers and the German population in order to break down stereotypes and prejudices. MCN counselors are committed to the principles of nonviolence. The network works in close cooperation with European, American, and international human rights, peace, church, and women’s groups.MCN, “Request for Funding,” p. 2. Through trainings in cooperation with the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors (CCCO), the network expanded and included counselors in Berlin, Frankfurt, Mutlangen, Heilbronn, Tübingen, and Hunsrück. All of the counselors contributed on a voluntary, part-time basis, while continuing in their other jobs until August 1990, when MCN officially closed due to financial struggles and a number of counselors leaving the area. Later that month, however, Iraq invaded Kuwait, and the US military build-up in the Middle East began. Over 100,000 US troops were deployed from Europe, and the need for MCN rose. During this time, MCNs' caseload increased, and counselors were even brought over from the US to help with the counseling. By mid-1995, however, MCN was disbanded as a coordinated organization after a decrease in case load. In 2003, as the United States prepared for another war in the Middle East, David Stutzman saw the reemerging need for military counseling. With the help of the Mennonite Central Committee, Connection e.V, and Ohne Rüstung Leben, MCN was re-founded as a project of the Deutsches Mennonitisches Friedenskomitee (the German Mennonite Peace Committee) 17 days before the War in Iraq began. Since 2004, when the Mennonite Mission Network also came on as a supporting partner, there have been two full-time personnel in the office.The Mennonite Weekly Review Awards 2008 Friedrich Siegmund- Schultze-Förderpreis (Friedrich-Siegmund Schultze Prize for Nonviolent Action) EAK - Kurzinformation zur Preisverleihung 2008 .

Its last assignment was with 455th Expeditionary Operations Group, based at Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan. It was inactivated on 1 October 2014. The squadron was first activated as the 4th Observation Squadron in Puerto Rico in 1941. During World War II it served from island bases in the eastern Caribbean Sea. It remained active after the war as the 4th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, becoming one of the first jet equipped reconnaissance squadrons in the Air Force before being inactivated in 1949's military budget reductions. It was active again from 1966 to 1971, primarily training crews for the Vietnam War, before its current role as an expeditionary unit, which began in 2005. HistoryCaribbean operations=World War II 4th Reconnaissance Squadron P-39 at Borinquen FieldAircraft is Bell P-39Q-5-BE Airacobra, serial 42-19622. Taken in 1943. 4th Reconnaissance Squadron B-25G Mitchell 1943, Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico, The squadron was first activated in April 1941 as the 4th Observation Squadron. Initially planned to serve as the main observation unit for the 13th Composite Wing, the unit in fact led something of a nomadic existence, being successively attached or assigned to the Puerto Rican Department, the 72d Observation Group, to the Antilles Air Task Force from 23 March 1943 until 1 June 1943, and finally to the Antilles Air Command itself from 1 June 1943 until the end of the war. In fact, this squadron was the only squadron to both start and finish the war in the Antilles throughout. The squadron was initially stationed at Ponce Air Base, Puerto Rico when activated. The unit itself had been formed from cadre drawn from Air Corps units already in Puerto Rico. By 5 June 1943, the squadron strength had increased to 12 aircraft. By the end of the month, one of the Curtiss O-52 Owls had been sent on detached service to Haiti, apparently in connection with the attempt that poor nation was making to establishing a coastal patrol of its territorial waters at the time. In early July 1943, the squadron received the first three of a number of Bell P-39Q Airacobra fighters that it was to operate until the end of the war. On 27 October 1943, the squadron moved en masse to Borinquen Field, as Losey Field was turned over to the Army Ground Forces due to its rather poorly situated runways. At this time, and since the Squadron's assignment to Antilles Air Command on 1 June, the unit became one of the primary tactical operating units in the area. Fortunately, the command recognized the new importance of the unit, and lobbied for equipment more capable than previously assigned. The following month, reflecting the changing war situation, the squadron received a North American B-25D Mitchell and four new B-25Gs, and in February 1943 added three more P-39Qs (for a total of nine), three new P-39Ns, and Douglas B-18 Bolos. 4th Reconnaissance Squadron F-5 Lightning near Coolidge Field, Antigua The squadron was occasionally tasked to perform flights throughout the Caribbean and, on one occasion, when the new airport was dedicated at Ciudad Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, every available P-39 was sent over (with belly tanks) where they put on a very lengthy aerial display for the locals. By 10 March 1944, unit strength had been considerably depleted, and the on-hand aircraft census consisted of three B¬25Ds and B-25Gs, a B-18 and a B-18C, three P-39Ns, and three P-39Qs. In October 1944, the Squadron received additional B-25D's. Shortly thereafter, the squadron was redesignated the 4th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron. Aside from frequent detachments of aircraft throughout the entire Caribbean basin during most of the war on an \\"as needed\\" basis, the unit itself did not move as a whole again until 21 May 1945 when it moved from Borinquen to Coolidge Field on Antigua where the unit also welcomed with six new Lockheed F-5G Lightnings in June. Move to Panama Lockheed FP-80 Shooting Star The squadron remained active after the war, moving from the Antilles to Rio Hato Army Air Base in March 1946, when it was assigned to Caribbean Air Command. In 1947, it became one of the first reconnaissance units of the new United States Air Force to be equipped with jet aircraft, when it began to fly the Lockheed RF-80 Shooting Star, moving to France Field, Panama Canal Zone in December. Because the runways at France Field were to short to accommodate the new jets, the squadron's Shooting Stars used the runway at the neighboring Coco Solo Naval Base, although this involved extensive taxiing until the planes were finally moved to the ramp at Coco Solo. President Truman's reduced 1949 defense budget required reductions in the number of units in the Air Force,Knaack, p. 25 and the squadron was inactivated on 14 March. =Vietnam war era= Bergstrom RF-4 after transfer to the 45th Tactical Reconnaissance SquadronAircraft is McDonnell RF-4C-33-MC Phantom II, serial 67-430. The squadron was organized in November 1966 as part of the 75th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas. The squadron trained for reconnaissance missions and prepared aircrews for the Vietnam War. In October 1971, the squadron was inactivated and its personnel, mission and equipment were transferred to the 45th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron. =Expeditionary operations in Afghanistan= In January 2005, the squadron was converted to provisional status as the 4th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Flight and assigned to Air Combat Command to activate or inactivate as needed for operations. It was activated as the 4th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron in November 2009 at Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan to operate the Beechcraft MC-12W Liberty with crews deployed from other locations. Along with the 361st Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron, it was one of two MC-12 squadrons comprising Project Liberty. On 1 October 2014, the squadron mission was transferred to Joint Task Force Thor as MC-12W operation moved from the Air Force to the Army. The squadron flew over 40,000 combat flights in Afghanistan. In its last year of operation it participated in the capture or death of over 2400 enemy combatants, including 375 identified as \\"high value.\\" Lineage * Constituted as the 4th Observation Squadron on 22 November 1940 : Activated on 1 April 1941 : Redesignated 4th Observation Squadron (Medium) on 26 February 1942 : Redesignated 4th Observation Squadron on 4 July 1942 : Redesignated 4th Reconnaissance Squadron (Special) on 25 June 1943 : Redesignated 4th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron on 20 May 1944 : Redesignated 4th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron (Photographic) on 17 June 1948 : Inactivated on 14 March 1949 : Redesignated 4th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron and activated on 25 Oct 1966 (not organized) * Organized on 18 November 1966 : Inactivated on 15 October 1971 : Redesignated 4th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Flight and converted to provisional status on 31 January 2005 : Redesignated 4th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron on 16 May 2007 : Activated 27 December 2009 : Inactivated 1 October 2014 =Assignments= * 13th Composite Wing, April 1941 * Puerto Rican Department, 14 July 1941 * 72d Observation Group, 29 March 1942 (attached to Puerto Rican Department until 23 March 1943, then to Antilles Air Task Force) * Antilles Air Command, 1 June 1943 * Caribbean Air Command, 25 August 1946 (attached to Provisional Composite Reconnaissance Group after 1 February 1948) * 6th Fighter Wing, 1 June 1948 (attached to Provisional Composite Reconnaissance Group) * 5600th Group, 28 July 1948 * 5600th Wing (later 5600th Composite Wing), 20 August 1948 – 14 March 1949 * Tactical Air Command, 25 October 1966 (not organized) * 75th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, c. 18 Nov 1966; * 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, 15 July – 15 October 1971 * Air Combat Command to activate or inactivate as needed, 31 January 2005 :: 455th Expeditionary Operations Group, 27 Dec 2009 – 1 October 2014 =Stations= * Ponce Air Base (later Losey Field), Puerto Rico, 1 April 1941 * Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico, 27 October 1943 * Coolidge Field, Antigua, 21 May 1945 * Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico, 5 October 1945 * Rio Hato Army Air Base, Panama, 20 August 1946 * France Field, Panama Canal Zone, 11 December 1947 * Howard Field, Panama Canal Zone, 20 August 1948 – 14 March 1949 * Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas, 18 November 1966 – 15 October 1971 * Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan, 27 Dec 2009 – 1 October 2014 =Aircraft= * North American O-47,1941–1945 * Curtiss O-52 Owl, 1941–1944 * Bell P-39 Airacobra, 1943–1945 * North American B-25 Mitchell, 1944–1946 * Lockheed F-5 Lightning, 1945–1946 * Stinson O-49 Vigilant, 1941–1945 * Martin B-26 Marauder, 1944–1945 * de Havilland F-8 Mosquito 1947–1948 * Lockheed RF-80 Shooting Star, 1947–1949Aircraft through 1949 in Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 30–31 * McDonnell RF-4C Phantom II, 1969–1971 * Beechcraft MC-12W Liberty, 2009–2014 ReferencesNotes= ; Explanatory notes ; Citations =Bibliography=  * * External links 004 Category:Reconnaissance squadrons of the United States Air Force ","title":"4th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron"},{"id":"21732114","text":"Pęklewo () is a settlement in the administrative district of Gmina Tolkmicko, within Elbląg County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, in northern Poland.

The settlement was also recorded with the name Sucase or Suckase. On a map issued from Amsterdam in 1640, Swedish cartographer Olao Ioannis Gotho named the settlement Fischerbud.

Fetherling, \\"Stringer, Arthur John Arbuthnott\\", Canadian Encyclopedia (Edmonton: Hurtig, 1988) However, his prairie trilogy - Prairie Wife (1915), Prairie Mother (1920), and Prairie Child (1921) - has been called \\"an enduring contribution to Canadian literature.\\" The trilogy uses a diary form to tell the tale of its narrator, a New England socialite who marries a Scots-Canadian farmer. =Poetry= The Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature described Stringer's poetry as \\"undistinguished verse.\\"\\"Arthur Stringer\\", Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature, Answers.com, May 8, 2011 However, author John Garvin said of his poetry \\"there is maintained a standard of beauty, depth of feeling, and technical power, which in Canada have had all too little recognition.\\"John W. Garvin, \\"Arthur Stringer,\\" Canadian Poets (Toronto: McClelland, Goodchild & Stewart, 1916), p. 313, UPenn.edu, May 8, 2011. Garvin also similarly praised Stringer's blank verse drama Sappho in Leucadia. Stringer's chief claim to poetic fame today rests on his 1914 book, Open Water, the first book by a Canadian poet to use free verse; in its preface he proclaimed that the modernist movement of which he was part was a \\"natural evolution\\". Louis Dudek and Michael Gnarowski, who reprinted the Open Water preface in their anthology The Making of Modern Poetry In Canada, remarked on it: > This book must be seen as a turning point in Canadian writing if only for > the importance of the ideas advanced by Stringer in his preface. In a > carefully presented, extremely well-informed account of traditional verse- > making, Stringer pleaded the cause of free verse and created what must now > be recognized as an early document of the struggle to free Canadian poetry > from the trammels of end-rhyme, and to liberalize its methods and its > substance.Ken Norris, \\"The Beginnings of Canadian Modernism,\\" Canadian > Poetry: Studies/Documents/Reviews, No. 11 (Fall/Winter, 1982), Canadian > Poetry, UWO.ca, March 25, 2011 Legacy Arthur Stringer House in London, Ontario Stringer was awarded an honorary D.Litt. by the University of Western Ontario in 1946.

On the previous day at nearby Oulart, several thousand rebels led by Fr John Murphy had massacred a detachment of the North Cork militia, amounting to 110 officers and men.Maxwell, W. H. History of the Irish Rebellion in 1798. H. H. Bohn, London 1854 Resistance The attack on Enniscorthy began at about 1 p.m., when the rebels drove a herd of cattle through the town's Duffry gate, creating disorder, and set the town's buildings on fire. The troops defending the gate withdrew to a stone bridge over the River Slaney. After a determined defence of about three hours, the loyalist forces had expended their ammunition. They were also flanked by rebels wading across the river's low water, but after having driven all the rebels out of town they were ordered to abandon the town and withdraw to Wexford, which they did alongside a terrified multitude of men, women and children fleeing the burning town.Field, Henry M. The Irish Confederates, and the rebellion of 1798 Harper &Brothers;, New York, 1851. pp 228–229. At archive.org In the action, the garrison and yeomanry had killed up to 500 insurgents at a cost of 90 of their own dead.Gordon, James B. \\" History of the Rebellion in Ireland in the year 1798, &c.;\\" London, 1803. Aftermath According to the historian Maxwell, the town's Protestants saw a merciless night attack as almost certain. Throughout the fight, Catholic residents had been supporting the rebels by shooting loyalists from their windows. Of the many fugitives, the weakest were carried on cavalry horses or otherwise abandoned to their fate, including infants and the elderly. The rebels were brutal and vengeful in occupying their captured town. They were setting up a formidable encampment of 10,000 men on the nearby heights of Vinegar Hill and were able to roster forces to garrison Enniscorthy, whose streets were littered with dead and dying while flames continued to rage. 478 dwelling houses were destroyed in addition to commercial premises.

The VVO area comprises the city of Dresden, together with the districts of Meißen and Sächsische Schweiz- Osterzgebirge, and the north-western part of the district of Bautzen. On 24 May 1998, a uniform public transport tariff system was adopted by the VVO's member companies. The joint area is divided into 21 tariff zones, the largest of which extends over the entire city of Dresden.  Members  The following companies are members of the association: * DB Regio AG * Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe AG * Müller Busreisen * Oberelbische Verkehrsgesellschaft Pirna-Sebnitz mbH * Regionalbus Oberlausitz GmbH * Regionalverkehr Dresden GmbH * Reisedienst Dreßler * Sächsische Dampfeisenbahngesellschaft mbH * Satra Eberhardt * Städtebahn Sachsen * Verkehrsgesellschaft Meißen mbH * Verkehrsgesellschaft Schwarze Elster mbH * Vogtlandbahn  Transport modes  The Verkehrsverbund Oberelbe covers a broad spectrum of transport modes. These include the regional trains operated by DB Regio and Städtebahn Sachsen, the Dresden S-Bahn system, two narrow gauge steam railway lines, the city trams of Dresden, the Kirnitzschtal Tramway, city and regional buses as well as several ferries across the Elbe in Dresden and Saxon Switzerland. In addition, there are some more unusual modes, which the VVO network terms special tourist services. These include two funiculars in Dresden, the Standseilbahn Dresden and the Schwebebahn Dresden. Also included are the Kirnitzschtalbahn, a rural tramway line, and the Bad Schandau Elevator, both located in the scenic Saxon Switzerland area. Although the special tourist services are part of the grouping they are subject to special tariffs, and the standard VVO fares do not apply. The cross-border Schöna to Hřensko Ferry is not a tourist attraction, but it is also not part of the joint tariff. Instead there are separate tariffs denominated in euro and Czech koruna.

Life habits Triboniophorus graeffei with grazing marks from its radula, on the trunk of a Sydney Blue Gum, near Dungog, Australia These slugs graze on algae which grows on the surface of the smooth bark of some eucalyptus trees and on rocks. Sometimes the slugs enter houses and have been known to graze on the mold that grows on bathroom walls.Stephanie Pain (July) 2000. Hate housework? Can't find a reliable cleaner? Try a slug. New Scientist Magazine, Melissa Kaplan's Herp Care Collection, Last updated April 19, 2007. Accessed 22 February 2009. This species of slug has been found to have an unusual defensive mechanism. It can secrete a kind of sticky mucus (different from the slippery slime secreted when it moves) that is strong enough to glue predators down for days. The glue is strongest in wet conditions and becomes less sticky as it dries. The cells responsible for secreting the glue are located across the dorsal surface. Description These slugs have two, not four, tentacles, and like other leaf-vein slugs, they have an indented pattern on their dorsum which resembles that of a leaf. The body length is up to 14 cm. They are very variable in color. Individual slugs can be white, off-white, yellow, dark or light grey, beige, pink, red, or olive green. Each of the color forms have a red (possibly orange, magenta, or maroon) triangle on the mantle surrounding the pneumostome, and a red line at the edge of the foot. The texture of the dorsum of the slug can be smooth or very rough. Juveniles lack the typical red foot border and red triangle of the adults but have three dark grey stripes running down the dorsal surface of their body and have the triangular mantle shield outlined with grey.pers. comm.

John Wiley & Sons, 2010. . It has two major and overlapping branches: aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering. Avionics engineering is similar, but deals with the electronics side of aerospace engineering. \\"Aeronautical engineering\\" was the original term for the field. As flight technology advanced to include vehicles operating in outer space, the broader term \\"aerospace engineering\\" has come into rare use. Aerospace engineering, particularly the astronautics branch, is often colloquially referred to as \\"rocket science\\". Overview Flight vehicles are subjected to demanding conditions such as those caused by changes in atmospheric pressure and temperature, with structural loads applied upon vehicle components. Consequently, they are usually the products of various technological and engineering disciplines including aerodynamics, propulsion, avionics, materials science, structural analysis and manufacturing. The interaction between these technologies is known as aerospace engineering. Because of the complexity and number of disciplines involved, aerospace engineering is carried out by teams of engineers, each having their own specialized area of expertise. History Orville and Wilbur Wright flew the Wright Flyer in 1903 at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The origin of aerospace engineering can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the late 19th to early 20th centuries, although the work of Sir George Cayley dates from the last decade of the 18th to mid-19th century. One of the most important people in the history of aeronautics and a pioneer in aeronautical engineering, Cayley is credited as the first person to separate the forces of lift and drag, which affect any atmospheric flight vehicle. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical, with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering. Some key elements, like fluid dynamics, were understood by 18th-century scientists. In December 1903, the Wright Brothers performed the first sustained, controlled flight of a powered, heavier-than- air aircraft, lasting 12 seconds. The 1910s saw the development of aeronautical engineering through the design of World War I military aircraft. Between World Wars I and II, great leaps were made in the field, accelerated by the advent of mainstream civil aviation. Notable airplanes of this era include the Curtiss JN 4, the Farman F.60 Goliath, and Fokker Trimotor. Notable military airplanes of this period include the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, the Supermarine Spitfire and the Messerschmitt Bf 109 from Japan, United Kingdom, and Germany respectively. A significant development in aerospace engineering came with the first operational Jet engine-powered airplane, the Messerschmitt Me 262 which entered service in 1944 towards the end of the second World War. The first definition of aerospace engineering appeared in February 1958, considering the Earth's atmosphere and outer space as a single realm, thereby encompassing both aircraft (aero) and spacecraft (space) under the newly coined term aerospace. In response to the USSR launching the first satellite, Sputnik, into space on October 4, 1957, U.S. aerospace engineers launched the first American satellite on January 31, 1958. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration was founded in 1958 as a response to the Cold War. In 1969, Apollo 11, the first manned space mission to the moon took place. It saw three astronauts enter orbit around the Moon, with two, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, visiting the lunar surface. The third astronaut, Michael Collins, stayed in orbit to rendezvous with Armstrong and Aldrin after their visit. A Ball Aerospace engineer performs final checks before the spacecraft is shipped to NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida for launch processing. An important innovation came on January 30, 1970, when the Boeing 747 made its first commercial flight from New York to London. This aircraft made history and became known as the \\"Jumbo Jet\\" or \\"Whale\\" due to its ability to hold up to 480 passengers. Another significant development in aerospace engineering came in 1976, with the development of the first passenger supersonic aircraft, the Concorde. The development of this aircraft was agreed upon by the French and British on November 29, 1962. On December 21, 1988, the Antonov An-225 Mriya cargo aircraft commenced its first flight. It holds the records for the world's heaviest aircraft, heaviest airlifted cargo, and longest airlifted cargo, and has the widest wingspan of any aircraft in operational service. On October 25, 2007, the Airbus A380 made its maiden commercial flight from Singapore to Sydney, Australia. This aircraft was the first passenger plane to surpass the Boeing 747 in terms of passenger capacity, with a maximum of 853. Though development of this aircraft began in 1988 as a competitor to the 747, the A380 made its first test flight in April 2005.

The tunnel behind the engine allows noise and exhaust to escape. Some of the elements of aerospace engineering are: * Radar cross-section – the study of vehicle signature apparent to remote sensing by radar. *Fluid mechanics – the study of fluid flow around objects. Specifically aerodynamics concerning the flow of air over bodies such as wings or through objects such as wind tunnels (see also lift and aeronautics). * Astrodynamics – the study of orbital mechanics including prediction of orbital elements when given a select few variables. While few schools in the United States teach this at the undergraduate level, several have graduate programs covering this topic (usually in conjunction with the Physics department of said college or university). * Statics and Dynamics (engineering mechanics) – the study of movement, forces, moments in mechanical systems. * Mathematics – in particular, calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra. * Electrotechnology – the study of electronics within engineering. * Propulsion – the energy to move a vehicle through the air (or in outer space) is provided by internal combustion engines, jet engines and turbomachinery, or rockets (see also propeller and spacecraft propulsion). A more recent addition to this module is electric propulsion and ion propulsion. * Control engineering – the study of mathematical modeling of the dynamic behavior of systems and designing them, usually using feedback signals, so that their dynamic behavior is desirable (stable, without large excursions, with minimum error). This applies to the dynamic behavior of aircraft, spacecraft, propulsion systems, and subsystems that exist on aerospace vehicles. * Aircraft structures – design of the physical configuration of the craft to withstand the forces encountered during flight. Aerospace engineering aims to keep structures lightweight and low-cost while maintaining structural integrity. * Materials science – related to structures, aerospace engineering also studies the materials of which the aerospace structures are to be built. New materials with very specific properties are invented, or existing ones are modified to improve their performance. * Solid mechanics – Closely related to material science is solid mechanics which deals with stress and strain analysis of the components of the vehicle. Nowadays there are several Finite Element programs such as MSC Patran/Nastran which aid engineers in the analytical process. * Aeroelasticity – the interaction of aerodynamic forces and structural flexibility, potentially causing flutter, divergence, etc. * Avionics – the design and programming of computer systems on board an aircraft or spacecraft and the simulation of systems. * Software – the specification, design, development, test, and implementation of computer software for aerospace applications, including flight software, ground control software, test & evaluation software, etc. * Risk and reliability – the study of risk and reliability assessment techniques and the mathematics involved in the quantitative methods. * Noise control – the study of the mechanics of sound transfer. * Aeroacoustics – the study of noise generation via either turbulent fluid motion or aerodynamic forces interacting with surfaces. * Flight testing – designing and executing flight test programs in order to gather and analyze performance and handling qualities data in order to determine if an aircraft meets its design and performance goals and certification requirements. The basis of most of these elements lies in theoretical physics, such as fluid dynamics for aerodynamics or the equations of motion for flight dynamics. There is also a large empirical component. Historically, this empirical component was derived from testing of scale models and prototypes, either in wind tunnels or in the free atmosphere. More recently, advances in computing have enabled the use of computational fluid dynamics to simulate the behavior of the fluid, reducing time and expense spent on wind-tunnel testing. Those studying hydrodynamics or hydroacoustics often obtain degrees in aerospace engineering. Additionally, aerospace engineering addresses the integration of all components that constitute an aerospace vehicle (subsystems including power, aerospace bearings, communications, thermal control, life support, etc.) and its life cycle (design, temperature, pressure, radiation, velocity, lifetime). Degree programs Aerospace engineering may be studied at the advanced diploma, bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. levels in aerospace engineering departments at many universities, and in mechanical engineering departments at others. A few departments offer degrees in space-focused astronautical engineering. Some institutions differentiate between aeronautical and astronautical engineering. Graduate degrees are offered in advanced or specialty areas for the aerospace industry. A background in chemistry, physics, computer science and mathematics is important for students pursuing an aerospace engineering degree. In popular culture The term \\"rocket scientist\\" is sometimes used to describe a person of great intelligence since rocket science is seen as a practice requiring great mental ability, especially technically and mathematically. The term is used ironically in the expression \\"It's not rocket science\\" to indicate that a task is simple. Strictly speaking, the use of \\"science\\" in \\"rocket science\\" is a misnomer since science is about understanding the origins, nature, and behavior of the universe; engineering is about using scientific and engineering principles to solve problems and develop new technology. However, \\"science\\" and \\"engineering\\" are often misused as synonyms.

WikiFood is an initiative of the Luxembourgish public research center „Centre de Recherche Public Henri Tudor“. The web portal is funded by the Luxembourgish research fund „Fonds National de la Recherche“ within a Luxembourgish research project on food security (Sécurité alimentaire). WikiFood.eu is part of the MENSSANA project (Mobile Expert and Networking System for Systematical Analysis of Nutrition-based Allergies).  Objectives  The objective of Wikifood.eu is to provide information on foodstuff and their ingredients to interested users via the internet. According to the provider of Wikifood.eu the target market consists, inter alia, of allergic persons and those suffering from food intolerance. The web portal is currently available in German, English and French. The WikiFood idea is based on the fact that – until now – the duty of declaration regarding ingredients of foodstuff within the EU does not require food producers to forward the ingredients lists to the final consumers by electronic means, for example using the means of a publicly accessible database (on food labelling see Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs, which has been amended frequently ). WikiFood enables registered users to type up the ingredients lists of products that may be interesting for the community of allergy patients and other consumers. Digital photos of EAN codes, packages, and ingredients lists allow users to check entries and to improve these if necessary. Additionally, producers of foodstuff can forward lists of ingredients of their own products to WikiFood in order to make these publicly available at no cost.  Development  On 15 September 2006 WikiFood.de was launched officially on the occasion of the German Allergy Congress organised by the “Ärzteverband Deutscher Allergologen“. Further medical and scientific partners are the “Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg” and the “Institut für Medizinische Statistik, Informatik und Epidemiologie” (Institute for Medical Statistics, Computer Science and Epidemiology) of the University of Cologne, Germany. Currently there are approximately 12.500 food products available and approximately 1000 volunteers registered. Meanwhile, Wikifood.eu was revised several times and new features were implemented such as an accompanying forum. The main focus of the forum lies on discussions regarding nutrition-based allergies and the exchange of individual experiences of the users.  Criticism  One point of criticism on Wikifood has been that it is no Wiki in the original sense as only registered users can edit content. Furthermore, even registered users are not allowed to change content which has been provided by food producers themselves. The provider of Wikifood.eu defends its approach by arguing that with this method it is easier to maintain a high data quality and provide high quality information. The provider of WikiFood.eu points out at several places on the website that there is no possibility of guaranteeing accuracy, completeness and/or up-to-date status of the information provided. Therefore, in the early stages of Wikifood.eu, only registered users were allowed to search the database.

History  TBI was established by the Coalition Provisional Authority on 17 July 2003 as an independent government entity to provide financial services to facilitate import and export of goods and services to and from Iraq. TBI was licensed by the Central Bank of Iraq and commenced its operations one month after the decision to establish it as a government financial institution had been taken. Since then, TBI has grown into a leading bank in Iraq through strengthening its financial position, assets, and equity. TBI started with paid-up capital of USD 5 million (authorised capital: USD 100 million) in July 2003 and the paid-up capital increased to IQD 1.75 trillion (USD 1.5 billion) as at the close of 2015 by capitalisation of retained earnings. TBI recorded an annual profit of USD 454 million during 2016. The bank quickly developed into an organization with an asset base of USD 19.7 billion as at the close of 2016. In the first year of operation TBI was associated with a consortium of international banks led by JPMorgan Chase. During the startup period, the consortium offered TBI technical support and banking know-how and it has been issuing and confirming letters of credit and letters of guarantee on behalf of TBI. The consortium remained at the heart of TBI's correspondent network and had been a key element in the successful growth of TBI's trade business. In a short period, TBI built relationships with an international network of 134 correspondent banks covering 63 cities spread over 39 countries. TBI's initial customer base consisted of ministries and government-run public sector corporations. During its first year of operation, TBI opened letters of credit only for the public sector clients. During 2005, the bank's customer base widened to include private sector companies and clients. TBI also started granting credit facilities and loans to the private sector in 2005.  Products and services  TBI is playing an important role in revitalising the Iraqi economy primarily by facilitating imports and exports and also through offering new and innovative customer-focused financial products to the public and private sector. These include saving accounts, current accounts, Priority Banking (Jumar), term deposits, certificate of deposits (tistahel), payroll accounts, Automated Clearing House (ACH), real-time gross settlement (RTGS), debit cards, credit cards, Automated Teller Machine (ATM), Point of Sale (POS), E-commerce, Cash Management, Foreign Exchange, trade services, Trade Finance, Personal loans, Car Loans, Term Finance, Working Capital Finance and Project Finance. TBI also finances salaried employees, getting their salaries through their accounts in TBI for purchasing vehicle, house and to meet their personal requirements.  Offices  Domestic offices = TBI has 25 domestic offices spread over Baghdad, Basra, Erbil, Sulaimaniyah, Najaf, Karbala, Hilla, Kut, Nasiriyah, Amarah, Ramadi and Tikrit governorates. The bank is expanding its network of branches to cover all governorates of Iraq. = Foreign offices = TBI opened a Representative Office at Abu Dhabi Global Market in UAE on 26 November 2017. It is the bank’s first office outside of Iraq. TBI also opened a branch in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in April 2019.

He died in Colmar on 3 September 1856. Louis-Philippe I sent Atthalin to Nicholas I of Russia to inform him of the former's accession. He was also present at the reburial of Napoleon's remains in 1840.  Military career  Baron Atthalin became a student of the École Polytechnique on 1 November 1802. He acquired the officer candidate rank of second lieutenant (engineering) on 23 September 1804, appointed lieutenant 17 November 1806, and captain 16 September 1808. Campaigning with Napoleon's Grande Armée in 1806 and 1807, Atthalin distinguished himself in military actions at Gardadeu, Molérès-M-Rey, and Wals. Atthalin also campaigned at Texel in 1810, again with the Grande Armée in 1812-1814, and was present at the Blockade of Landau in 1815. During his time as a captain Atthalin came to the attention of Napoleon, who made him an aide de camp on 14 April 1811. Atthalin rose to battalion commander on 18 November 1813, and colonel on 15 March 1814. In this same year the Duke of Orléans, Louis-Philippe d'Orléans (the future king, Louis-Philippe 1), named Atthalin as one of his own aide de camps. On 26 April 1815, during the Hundred Days of Napoleon, he was employed as the Commandant of Engineering at Landau. On 12 August 1830, the now King Louis-Philippe I named Atthalin, now himself a general, as Maréchal de Camp. Atthalin, though, retained his role as aide de camp. The King sent Atthalin to Russia, to officially inform the Emperor Nicholas I of his new reign. Supported by the votes of the ministers of the King, Atthalin was elected to the fourth electoral college of Bas-Rhin (Strasbourg) on 23 January 1831. He remained as a member in what was referred to as the Chamber of Peers, until 11 October 1836. Atthalin continued to faithfully support the kingdom (known as the July Monarchy), and on 16 November 1840, he was promoted to lieutenant general. The subsequent fall and exile of the Orléans family, however, left him stripped of his titles. He retired on 14 August 1848 and stayed away from politics for the remainder of his life.

It is named after the Lek River. Heerlijkheid According to the 19th-century historian Van der Aa, the old Heerlijkheid van de Lek covered the villages Lekkerkerk, Krimpen aan de Lek, Krimpen aan den IJssel, Ouderkerk aan den IJssel, Berkenwoude and Stormpolder, and possibly Nieuw-Lekkerland. This was a large area east of Rotterdam. The first Lord of the Lek is reported to be a younger brother of Diederik II of Brederode. After his death around 1063, the heerlijkheid became first a property of the lords of Teilingen, and then of the lords of Polanen. When Engelbert I of Nassau married Johanna van Polanen van der Lekke in 1404, the possession went to the house of Nassau. After the death of Prince Maurice of Nassau, De Lek was inherited by his illegitimate son William, who called himself Nassau-LaLecq after De Lek. The last descendant of this family was Jan Floris van Nassau-Lalecq, who died in 1824. Municipality Around 1800, the manorial system in the Netherlands was abolished. The villages in the heerlijkheid De Lek became independent municipalities, but small part of the heerlijkheid was excluded and remained a separate municipality, \\"De Lek\\". It was only a municipality in name, having no mayor or other municipal services. The municipality covered the river Lek between Ammerstol and Krimpen aan den IJssel, and some islands and surrounding lands. Its area was 5.99 km2, of which 1.24 km2 was land, and it contained several small fisherman's huts and boathouses, but it had no inhabitants. In 1847, the territory of De Lek was divided among the surrounding municipalities.

It lies approximately 10 km (6 mi.) north of Ryn, 12 km (7 mi.) west of Giżycko and 76 km (47 mi.) east of the regional capital, Olsztyn. Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (East Prussia). History Groß Stürlack was founded in 1387 by the Teutonic Knights (German Order). The town was burned down during an invasion of East Prussia by the Crimean Tatars in 1656, but was recovered by the Germans in 1661. By 1811 Groß Stürlack was a village numbering 48 houses with a population of 411. In 1874 it became a German administrative town (Amtsdorf) belonging to the district of Lötzen (now Giżycko, Poland), which it remained until the border changes of 1945. In 1910, four years before the outbreak of World War I, Groß Stürlack was home to 877 residents. After the war, on July 11, 1920, the East Prussian plebiscite, mandated by the Versailles Treaty, was held in the District of Allenstein (now Olzstyn). District-wide results were 1,480 votes for Germany and 1 (one) vote for Poland. In Groß Stürlack, 700 votes were cast for remaining in Germany, none for joining Poland. Eight years later, the neighboring village of Adlig Stürlack (Polish: Sterławki Szlacheckie) was annexed to Groß Stürlack, and by 1933 the town's population had risen to 941. After World War II, southern East Prussia was assigned to Poland under border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference in July-August 1945. The name Groß Stürlack was rendered in Polish as Sterławki Wielkie, remaining German residents were expelled, and Polish settlers eventually replaced them. Sterławki Wielkie has been part of the Polish Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship since 1988.

Dengue fever is being transmitted by mosquitoes. The 2009 Bolivian dengue fever epidemic was an epidemic of dengue fever which struck Bolivia in early 2009, escalating into a national emergency by February. The BBC described it as the worst outbreak of dengue fever in the country's history. At least 18 people died and 31,000 were infected by the mosquito-transmitted arbovirus. On 20 February, the Pan American Health Organization reported that eighty (80) cases of the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever had occurred in Bolivia since January, of which 22% were fatal. Bolivia requested outside assistance and foreign aid.  Background  Bolivia first declared a national emergency in early February 2009, when it alerted the world about the country's worst outbreak of dengue fever in twenty-two years. By 3 February, five people had died in the east of the country and over 7,000 more were infected. Worst hit is the Santa Cruz Department, near the Paraguayan border and the Amazon. A number of military facilities, particularly in the city of Santa Cruz, were turned into temporary hospitals as the real hospitals struggled to cope with the conditions. Thousands of soldiers were mobilized to assist medical workers. The government then allocated funds to supply hospitals across the country; however, it was criticised in some quarters for the slowness of its actions. The infection was most widespread in the tropical eastern lowlands, where conditions led to a thriving mosquito population. Bolivia's healthcare services had difficulty in coping with the outbreak, with experts from Venezuela, Cuba, Paraguay and the World Health Organization called in to assist.  Foreign aid  * Hirofumi Nakasone, Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs planned to send seven million yen in emergency relief goods.  Mosquito transmission  Mosquitoes thrive in the high temperatures and humidity of the Bolivian lowlands and it was that region which saw the highest numbers of infected civilians. There is currently no vaccine for dengue fever. Those infected experience flu-like symptoms such as severe headaches, fevers and joint pain. 1 of 4 people infected with dengue will develop symptoms. There is no specific treatment for dengue, other than managing the symptoms. The best way to address dengue is to disrupt the mosquito's habitat. Mosquitos breed in stagnant water, i.e. open storage containers, discarded tires, and uncollected garbage. The infected are advised by medical experts to drink plenty of fluids and obtain significant rest. Dengue fever sufferers have an approximate 1% chance of progressing to the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever. 1 of 20 individuals who become ill with dengue will develop severe dengue. Severe dengue can lead to life-threatening condition including shock, internal bleeding, or death. Other symptoms include hypothermia, vomiting, severe abdominal pain and confusion. The global average case-fatality ratio for dengue hemorrhagic fever is 5%.

When it opened, it was the first teacher training college for women in Great Britain. It was named for Maria Georgina Grey, a promoter of women's education and a founder of the organisation that became the Girls' Day School Trust. History The college was opened as the Teachers' Training & Registration Society College on 1 May 1878 in the Clergy House, Skinner Street, Bishopsgate (now Pindar Street). In some literature it is recorded as the first teacher training college for women, however Whitelands College (now part of the University of Roehampton) opened in 1841 as a women's teacher training college and was the first such college in England for women. The Teachers' Training & Registration Society was created by the Women's Education Union to promote women's right to education and the professional recognition of female teachers. The Society was promoted by Maria Georgina Grey, who had also been fundamental in the founding of the Union. In 1885, it moved to Fitzroy Square, and in March 1886 it was renamed Maria Grey College after its founder. The college was attached to Brondesbury and Kilburn High School so that the trainee teachers could test their skills in a classroom situation. New buildings for the college and high school were erected in 1892, designed by architect J. Osborne Smith, at a cost of £11,500 (£ as of ). In 1892, it attracted Alice Woods as its new head. She was not a great administrator but she focussed on raising the quality of the student's work. Under her leadership, she was able to have lecturers who were all graduates for every area except for the kindergarten. The teachers learnt about teaching methods developed by Maria Montessori and Froebel. In 1946, it moved to Twickenham. In 1976, the College merged with Borough Road College and Acton & Chiswick Polytechnic to form the West London Institute of Higher Education. In 1995, the West London Institute of Higher Education became part of Brunel University. The site was sold when the department moved to Uxbridge in 2005. Primary sources The records of the College are now held in the Brunel University Archives.

Mannie Garcia is an American freelance photojournalist currently based in Washington, D.C. His photos have been in many publications including TIME, The Washington Post and USA Today. History Garcia's photos of the Ramstein airshow disaster in West Germany won a World Press Photo Award in 1989. During the disaster, he narrowly escaped death when a flying chunk of one of the jet's wings nearly hit him in the head. One of his cameras was smashed by shrapnel, preventing it from hitting him instead. After shooting photos of the crashing jets and fleeing spectators, Garcia helped the wounded.Time Magazine, December 26, 1988, Pg. 43 Sixty-seven spectators and three pilots died in the disaster, and 346 spectators sustained serious injuries in the resulting explosion and fire. In the early 1990s, Garcia shot photos of the Somali Civil War. In the mid-1990s he photographed the Bosnian War for The New York Times. Garcia's photograph of President George W. Bush surveying the damage from Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 from the high remove of Air Force One became a symbol of his administration's slow and detached reaction to the human suffering and wreckage below. In April 2006, Garcia took the photograph of Barack Obama that was later used uncredited by artist Shepard Fairey as the basis of Fairey's Barack Obama HOPE poster. Arrest and lawsuit In 2011, Garcia was arrested by a police officer in Wheaton, Maryland. According to Garcia, after he began taking pictures of a police incident across the street, one of the officers grabbed him by the neck, struck him, slammed his head onto a police car, and removed the memory chip from his camera. Garcia was charged with disorderly conduct and the police report claimed that he \\"threw himself to the ground, attempting to injure himself.\\" He was acquitted of the charge several months later. His White House press credentials were not renewed because of the outstanding charge, but were renewed after the acquittal. On December 7, 2012, Garcia reinstated a lawsuit against Montgomery County, Maryland, its chief of police and several officers of the Montgomery County Police Department seeking among other things, compensatory and punitive damages. On March 4, 2013 the Justice Department filed a statement of interest with the district court hearing the lawsuit, asserting its position that citizens have a First Amendment right to peacefully photograph law enforcement officers in the exercise of their duties, and urging the court to rule against a motion to dismiss filed by the defendants.The statement that the Justice Department filed with the federal Maryland district court in Garcia's lawsuit. On March 3rd, 2017, Montgomery County Associate Attorneys Patricia L. Kane and Jannette L. Frumkin, for Montgomery County, Maryland, accepted an agreement on behalf of Montgomery county Police officers, Christopher Malouf, Kevin Baxter as well as the county and paid Mr. Garcia $45,000.00 as result stemming from his unlawful arrest on June 16th, 2011, on a public sidewalk in Montgomery County, Maryland for photographing an arrest. Later in 2017, legal damages (legal fees) were also awarded to Mr. Garcia's legal team headed up by Robert Corn- Revere Esq. and Ronald G. London Esq., of Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, Washington, DC, in an amount over $200,000.00. Mickey Osterreicher, General Counsel of the NPPA (National Press Photographer's Association) was instrumental in championing this case involving freelance photojournalist Mannie Garcia and both the Police of Montgomery County and Montgomery County.

Although he's well aware of Morgan's crush on Ellie,Captain Awesome's Blog, February 14, 2009: Captain Awesome's Tips for Being Awesome Devon is not at all threatened by him, and when he finds Morgan on the bed with and comforting Ellie after she and Devon have a fight, Devon doesn't even suspect that she slept with Morgan.\\"Chuck Versus the Undercover Lover\\" Devon shows signs of considering Morgan as something of a friend. He offers him advice on the finer points of being a man when Chuck is upset with Morgan's immaturity,\\"Chuck Versus the Sandworm\\" and turns to Morgan for advice on how to woo Ellie. Devon also loans Morgan money for an apartment, but is later angered to find Morgan impulsively used the money to buy a used, barely functioning DeLorean.\\"Chuck Versus the DeLorean\\" Devon allows Morgan to stay on the couch for a few days to escape Big Mike's relationship with his mother.\\"Chuck Versus the Beefcake\\" He attempted to outsource some of his wedding-preparation responsibilities to Chuck by asking him to find a band. Jeff and Lester offered their services, and after a miserable audition, Jeff convinces Devon to give them a second chance. Although Jeffster! is still less than impressive, Devon tells Ellie that he can still let them live their dream for five minutes.\\"Chuck Versus the Best Friend\\" Devon has difficulty empathizing with other characters due to his awesome nature; when Jeff asks, \\"Have you ever had a dream that's never come true?\\" Devon has to think for a moment before admitting, \\"No.\\" When trying to comfort Casey about his life, believing at the time that John is merely a Buy More employee, Devon tells about a time when his life was disappointing and unfulfilled, then confesses that such a time never actually happened. Devon is confident about his appearance and masculinity. He frequently wears form- fitting sports attire or little to no clothing at all, a practice which bothers both Ellie and Chuck (though Chuck does congratulate Devon for what God gave him). He teaches Chuck to tango while wearing only underwear and his bathrobe (which he discards at one point) and has Chuck put his hands on his butt. For Halloween, he dresses up as Adam while wearing only flesh-colored underwear fitted with a fake fig leaf. This comfort level also extends towards sex in general, as he frequently makes suggestive remarks about Chuck and Sarah's sex life\\"Chuck Versus the Lethal Weapon\\" and his and Ellie's relationship. In spite of his easy going, \\"valley\\" personality, Devon is highly intelligent and observant. Although he was not aware at the time that Chuck and Sarah's relationship was just a cover, he accurately recognized that Sarah's feelings for Chuck were genuine. He may have observed more than is good for him when going under due to a tranq and later a glimpse of General Beckman on Chuck's computer monitor. When he later learns of Chuck's secret life\\"Chuck Versus the Colonel\\" he is highly impressed with his brother-in-law as Chuck is not \\"just a loser who worked at the Buy More.\\" Due to this knowledge he lets Morgan stall his wedding upon learning Chuck asked for it. However, Devon does have moments that bring his intelligence to question. Mostly these are minor bouts where he seems devoid of common sense, such as packing a set of dumbbells for his trip to Africa or loaning Morgan, who is notorious for his immaturity and irresponsible behaviour, a sizable amount of money. But the few times Devon has been required to lie, Devon has either been unable to speak, or his lies have been so extravagantly transparent, Chuck has had to step in to spin a more believable yarn (to which, Devon, again, begins to overdo it, until Chuck interrupts and continues); Devon admits to being a terrible liar, to which a sardonic and disappointed Chuck can only respond, \\"Clearly.\\"\\"Chuck Versus Operation Awesome Josh Schwartz indicated that Devon's knowledge of Chuck's secret life will lead to his becoming increasingly involved in Team Bartowski's spy operations as Season Three develops, and he got his first taste of the spy life in \\"Chuck Versus the Angel de la Muerte.\\" Devon was initially enthusiastic about spy work and asked Chuck several times for a chance to participate for the adrenaline rush, but he eventually came to realize the sacrifices Chuck has had to make in his real life and decided he would rather live his whole life with Ellie than to give up any of it for a double life as a spy. \\"Chuck Versus the Nacho Sampler\\" has shown that Devon was deeply affected by his capture by the Ring, leaving him jumpy and nervous, and showed a great deal of difficulty covering for Chuck with Ellie. He was shocked by the ease with which Chuck has learned to lie to his sister, and as a result refused to accept tickets to Paris Chuck gave her as part of his cover. When his getaway with Ellie in \\"Chuck Versus the Beard\\" is interrupted by news that The Ring may be putting him and Ellie in danger, he grows very upset, especially since Chuck had told him that he and Ellie would be safe. He is then informed that it was a false alarm, but he later confronts Chuck, and is not comforted by Chuck's assurances that the government is doing everything possible to keep them safe. He proposes to Ellie that they get away-far away to Africa, working for Doctors Without Borders. In \\"Chuck Versus the Tic Tac,\\" however, Ellie is accepted to a neurology fellowship at USC, a dream of hers since childhood, and despite his desire to get them both away from danger, he eventually sees how important it is to her and decides to try to make it work. In \\"Chuck Versus the Role Models\\" Devon is poisoned by a Ring agent while in Africa in such a manner as to appear to be stricken by malaria. Devon returns to Burbank to recover in \\"Chuck Versus the Tooth,\\" and expresses to Morgan his realization that even without spies life is dangerous, setting him at ease over his involvement in Chuck's double life for the first time since \\"Chuck Versus the Angel de la Muerte.\\" While Devon knew Chuck was a spy since the end of the second season, it is never made clear whether or not he is aware of the Intersect. It is unlikely, however, as the only time Devon asked about Chuck's training was when Chuck tranquilized a slew of CIA guards at a distance in \\"Chuck Versus Operation Awesome\\". Chuck then responded that he honed the skills by playing Duck Hunt. He is made aware of the existence of the Intersect in the fourth season as Ellie uncovers information about the project via the laptop and, one may assume, fully aware of Chuck's Intersect after Chuck's confession to Ellie and a demonstration Chuck provided in \\"Chuck Versus the Last Details.\\" In \\"Chuck Versus the Leftovers\\", Devon learns that Chuck has resumed his trade in espionage and, with restrained anger, expressed that he didn't want Ellie brought into that life. He demands that Chuck keeps his life away from Ellie, and expresses that he doesn't want to know about his spying. He does, however, accept Chuck's vocation, as he hands over Stephen's laptop, saying \\"I don't wanna know, and neither does Ellie, but if you're spying again, maybe it can help you.\\" Major plots Although typically part of each episode's \\"B\\" plot, Devon has infrequently been involved in the main plots. When Sarah is injured in an explosion and Bryce Larkin shows up to visit her, Devon takes it on himself to run interference and chase him off. Their ensuing conversation convinces Bryce that Sarah is no longer in love with him and that her feelings for Chuck are genuine.\\"Chuck Versus the Break- Up\\" Chuck and the male Buy More employees kidnap Devon for a bachelor party, though Chuck only participated because of its implications in a mission to steal Devon's hospital access card. Devon seemed pleased with the event, calling it \\"awesome,\\" and explained to Ellie that Chuck and the boys kidnapped him into participation. He reaffirmed his love for Ellie during the bachelor party, declining to compromise his relationship with inappropriate behavior. However posing as a lady cop-themed stripper, Agent Alex Forrest lured him into the home theater room, where she attempted to remove the access card from him under the guise of a strip-search. When he refused, she tranquilized him. While in a state of momentary confusion before passing out, he overheard Chuck talk of the CIA. These glimpses did not seem to have a lasting impression, however. He later got a brief glance of General Beckman on Chuck's TV when he inadvertently triggered a video conference by uttering Chuck's CIA alias, Charles Carmichael. Ellie later viewed some photos taken of him with Agent Forrest, somewhat damaging Ellie and Devon's relationship. In \\"Chuck Versus the Colonel\\" Devon, while trying to find Chuck, learns of John Casey's extensive surveillance of him from Lester and Jeff and uses keys from his locker to enter Casey's apartment. While attempting to access Casey's computer Devon unwittingly triggers a lockdown, with metal bars blocking the windows and doors of the apartment. When Casey arrives and begins to put a silencer on his pistol, a major confrontation ensues between Devon, Casey, Sarah, and Chuck during which Chuck admits to being a high-level CIA asset with Casey and Sarah as his handlers. Devon considers it \\"awesome\\" and agrees to cover for Chuck with Ellie. Devon later allows Morgan to stall his first wedding with Ellie when he tells Devon the order comes from Chuck. The second ceremony takes place later on the beach. Devon is on call when Alejandro Goya, president of the nation of Costa Gravas, is nearly assassinated. Devon saves his life and is invited, along with Chuck and Sarah, to a gala event at the Costa Gravas embassy, where the team attempts to protect Goya. He eventually becomes directly involved in the team's mission when he accidentally mistakes Casey for the assassin, and takes advantage of the third assassination attempt to sneak Chuck and Sarah in to rescue him. At the end of the episode Devon is captured by the assassin, who works for the Ring. Being held hostage by Ring Operative Sydney, he is believed by the Ring to be an undercover CIA agent in the local area. Being forced into the spy world, Chuck has to handle Devon as Sydney assigns him to assassinate a man later revealed as Daniel Shaw; as planned as a setup to convince the Ring of Devon's abilities of a spy. While successful, this required Devon to become an asset in order to infiltrate the Ring, or at the least lure Sydney in order to cover his personal information. Chuck refuses, and devises a plan to remove Sydney without involving Devon.

Navajo Nation, 556 U.S. 287 (2009), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Navajo Nation initiated proceedings in the Court of Federal Claims alleging that when they sought the assistance of the United States Secretary of the Interior to renegotiate their original leasing agreement with the Peabody Coal Company in 1984, a procedural process defined by the 1964 Indian Mineral Leasing Act (IMLA) of 1938, the United States Secretary of the Interior had been improperly influenced by the coal company, and as a result, had breached his fiduciary duty to the Nation when he approved the 1987 lease amendments.  Background  The Indian Mineral Leasing Act (IMLA) of 1938 was brought to the attention of the Navajo people in 1964 when the Navajo Nation entered into an agreement with a third party to lease a substantial portion of Navajo land for coal mining.. The Navajo Nation complained that the United States acted in the interests of a coal mining company, and not in the interests of the Navajo Nation, when negotiating the rate of royalty payments owed on coal mined from Navajo land. The Court of Federal Claims dismissed the complaint, ruling that although the United States had breached its fiduciary obligations to the Navajo Nation, this breach was not actionable because the United States did not have a trust relationship with the Navajo Nation and monetary relief was not available. The court of appeals reversed, holding (1) that a trust relationship existed and exists with the Navajo Nation, and (2) monetary damages are an available remedy for breach of this trust. = Questions presented = * Whether the court of appeals’ holding that the United States breached fiduciary duties in connection with the Navajo coal lease amendments is foreclosed by Navajo? * Is the United States liable to the Navajo Nation for up to $600 million in damages for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the Secretary's actions concerning an Indian mineral lease? * Did the Secretary violate any specific statutory or regulatory duty established pursuant to the IMLA? = Issues = The Supreme Court's ruling in this case will conclude the parties from raising the arguments advanced in this appeal? It this is not so, it is only right to see if the Secretary of the Interior's approval of the Navajo Nation's 1987 mineral lease based violate the common-law fiduciary duties that give rise to an actionable claim for the damage done? = Facts = The Navajo Nation is the biggest reservation in the United States, and extends into the states of Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, covering over . Diné Bikéyah, or Navajoland, is larger than 10 of the 50 states in America. The Navajo Nation's (“the Nation’s”) reservation lands contain a vast amount of coal, which is held in trust for the Nation by the federal government. The Nation and the predecessor in interest to the Peabody Western Coal Company (“Peabody”) entered into a lease for access to the Nation's mineral exchange for money. The lease was approved by the Secretary of the Interior with insight that there needs to be reasonable adjustments at the end of the term by the Secretary. While the appeal was pending, both Peabody and Nation anticipated a ruling in favor of the Nation.  Conclusion  The Court ruled that an Indian Tribe must \\"identify a substantive source of law that establishes specific fiduciary or other duties.\\" The unanimous opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia held that the IMLA could not be interpreted to require the Secretary to exercise broad authority to manage the tribe's resources for the tribe's benefit. Instead, the tribe itself controls negotiations and the Secretary has a more limited role in approving the agreements. The Court concluded that no provision of the IMLA entitled the tribe to monetary damages as a result of the government's role in the negotiations.
