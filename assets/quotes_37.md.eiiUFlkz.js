Machado was the basis or beginning of that love of poetry. Juan Jos√© felt very identified with Jorge Manrique, the similarity of matches between the two poets is palpable, as he warned, and his early years in the Sierra de Segura, his transfer to the prison of Baeza, which compares with an internship at the Institute of Baeza, and mother's maiden name of Molly, his wife, and the wife of Jorge, both of Ayala, and Guiomar Menesses de Ayala.Juan Jos√© Cuadros, from Manrique  Evolution  { \\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\" ESTE AMOR NO ES LO QUE ERA Entonces ten√≠a m√°s claros los ojos, el talle de lirio silvestre, la frente m√°s alta, su largo cabello de oro dejaba en la piel de los labios un recuerdo de miel de romero y flor de granado.

His arrival in Madrid, will be the start of that poetic maturity in his work-this is mainly due to large capital resources offered, and the friendships and relationships that emerge, one of them, Ramon de Garciasol, great friend and family, with their experience and countless tips. And mainly the contact locals and especially poets Palencia, being part of the magazine Rocamadour, reaches that maturity. His works are divided between Poetry and Prose.

History  The brewery was established in 2004 by Ross Smith, with head brewer, Steve Plowman, and was one of only three breweries established in the Margaret River area. In late 2006 the brewery was purchased by a group of investment bankers, the Empire Beer Group for $15M (AUS), who subsequently arranged a $30M (AUS) public float, to bankroll plans to open another outlet (with a larger brewing and packaging facility) in Fremantle. In July 2007 the Empire Beer Group purchased the Royal Bar and Brasserie in East Perth for $3.5M (AUS), a departure from the plans outlined in the company's prospectus (which was to develop a second pub in Fremantle). In August 2008 the Empire Beer Group agreed to sell 'The Royal on the Waterfront' and the Colonial Brewing Company to the Colonial Leisure Group for $4.5M (AUS), a company owned by Chris Morris (the founder of Computershare). In 2008 Colonial appointed Mal Secourable as the head brewer (formerly the head brewer at Matso‚Äôs in Broome and a brewer at Fremantle‚Äôs Sail & Anchor), replacing Dean McLeod (who previously worked at the Lord Nelson Brewery Hotel and Malt Shovel Brewery). In 2009 the Colonial Kolsch won 'Best Ale Draught', Best Commercial Beer' and the Premier's Trophy for 'Best Western Australian Beer' at the Cryer Malt Perth Royal Show.

Tarrant (1799August 1858), for whom Tarrant County was named, served the Republic of Texas and the State of Texas by fighting hostile Indians for two decades. He also served in the Texas House of Representatives during both periods. Early life and education Edward was a young veteran of the War of 1812, taking part in the Battle of New Orleans (1814‚Äì15) at the age of 19, probably as a private in the Kentucky state militia. Having moved to Tennessee, he was elected a colonel of the Tennessee state militia, in the frontier environment. By 1827, Tarrant had become a sheriff of Henry County, Tennessee, but he moved to Texas by the early 1830s and established a ranch in Red River County. He became one of the most prosperous landowners, and he owned slaves. Career In September 1837, Tarrant was elected to represent Red River County in the House of Representatives of the Second Texan Congress; but after a few months, he resigned to serve the republic by directing ranger activities against the Indians in 1838. In 1838-39, he served as chief justice in Red River County and was elected Brigadier-general of a northeast Texas militia unit called the Fourth Brigade. Tarrant's Indian-fighting career culminated in the battle of Village Creek, east of present-day Fort Worth, in May 1841. In 1843, Tarrant, along with George W. Terrell, negotiated the Treaty of Bird's Fort with nine tribes of Native Americans. Tarrant served two terms in the state House of Representatives, between 1849 and 1853. In April 1851, he married Mary Danforth. The couple resided on Chambers Creek near Italy, Ellis County, Texas. As fighting Indians had become his specialty, in 1857, Tarrant moved part of his household to Fort Belknap in present-day Young County. He led a \\"go-to\\" fighting force to protect settlers in that locale from frequent Indian uprisings. Later life and death In 1857, Tarrant began moving part of his household to Fort Belknap. On one of his journeys, General Tarrant fell ill and died on August 2, 1858, at the home of William Fondren, which is 10 miles from Weatherford, Texas, in Parker County. He was initially interred in the William Fondren family cemetery. On January 28, 1859, Tarrant's remains were moved to a grave on his Chambers Creek family farm in Ellis County, Texas.

MM Xozwa, instructed by the Justice Centre, Grahamstown, appeared for the appellant; H. Obermeyer (DPP, Grahamstown) appeared for the State. The case was an appeal against sentence imposed in a regional court.  Facts  The appellant was convicted in a regional court on two counts of contravening section 1(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act.Act 1 of 1988. The prohibited acts which constituted the contraventions were murder (of one Batandwa Ndalase) and attempted murder (of one Sandasile Nxiki), respectively. Regarding the appropriate punishment, the magistrate applied the provision that a contravention of section 1(1) could attract the same penalty as that which might be imposed for the unlawful act itself. He found that no substantial and compelling circumstances existed that would justify a sentence of less than the fifteen years' imprisonment stipulated in section 51(2) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act,Act 105 of 1997. and proceeded to impose that sentence, treating the two counts as one.  Argument  The appellant appealed against the sentence on the grounds: # that no reference had been made in the charge-sheet to the provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act; and # that the sentence was startlingly inappropriate.  Judgment  The High Court, having reserved judgment, held that it was clear from the address of the appellant's legal representative on sentence that she had been aware of the applicability of the minimum sentence provisions. She had submitted that substantial and compelling circumstances were present, and had not been surprised by the trial court's application of these provisions. Accordingly, the lack of reference thereto in the charge- sheet had not rendered the trial unfair.Paras 4-5. In its judgment on sentence, the trial court had not mentioned the appellant's personal circumstances, and had dealt only with the seriousness of the offences. The magistrate seemed to the High Court not to have appreciated the difference between the offences of which the appellant had been convicted, and the offences of murder and attempted murder. These amounted to misdirections that entitled the High Court to interfere with sentence. The appellant had a clean record. His employment, for which he was pursuing higher qualifications, together with his support for his family, showed that he was a useful and responsible member of society. On the other hand, his actions had had serious consequences, including violent loss of life. There was also a high incidence of alcohol-related assaults in society. It was in society's interests that the courts be seen to impose sentences that would deter that kind of behaviour. A custodial sentence, the court found, was the only appropriate one. It emerged from a consideration of previous cases, however, that appreciably lower sentences were imposed than would have been if the relevant accused or appellants had been convicted of the underlying prohibited acts. In casu, a sentence of seven years' imprisonment on the first count, and four years on the second, was appropriate. Since the two offences had been closely linked in time and circumstance, the sentences should run concurrently.Paras 16‚Äì27. The appeal was thus upheld: The sentence of fifteen years' imprisonment was set aside and replaced with one of seven years' and four years' imprisonment, running concurrently.

Description The property is located north east of Innamincka and south east of Birdsville in the Channel Country of Queensland. It has double frontage to Coopers Creek and is bounded to the west by the South Australian border. The station currently occupies an area of and is able to carry 11,000 head of cattle. It is currently owned by Morella Agriculture (David Coulton) and is managed by Peter Degoumois. History The traditional owners of the area are the Wongkumara peoples. The name comes from the words ngappa meaning water and merri meaning sandhill. The property doesn't have a huge number of channels through the area but is part of a natural floodplain and contains low lying swamps that provide excellent feed after floodouts that last until the dry season. The homestead has been built above and adjacent to the Nappa Merrie waterhole. The station was one of the first established along Cooper Creek, taken up in 1871 by John Conrick. Conrick and five companions, all under the age of 21, overlanded a herd of about 1,000 cattle to the property from Warrnambool to stock the station. The Conrick family later took up the Chasleton lease and remained on the station for the next 83 years. From 1892 to 1934 the property was running mostly sheep with only a few cattle. Remnants of fences and an old wool scour can still be found on the property. At one point a flock of 46,000 head of sheep were grazing on the property resulting in the land collapsing and the station being vacated for a time. In the late 1940s the Tancred brothers invested in the company with Harry Tancred later appointed as the chairman of directors. Shortly afterward the Lake Pure lease was acquired. Cattle grazing, which had been confined to the channels and wetlands, was expanded after bores were sunk in the plains away from the channel country allowing stock to roam further. The entire area was struck by drought in 1946 with many cattle dying and properties destocking. Airmail delivery to remote properties in outback South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland commenced in 1949. Nappa Merrie along with other remote properties including Mungerannie, Clifton Hills, Glengyle, Davenport Downs, Morney Plains, Mount Leonard, Durrie, Mulka, Tanbar, Durham Downs, Cordillo Downs, Lake Pure and Naryilco were also on the route. The Cooper Creek broke its banks in 1950 resulting in widespread flooding through the area. In 1954 the station was sold, Nappa Merrie included the Lake Pure and Chasleton leases and occupied an area of and was sold to the Playford River Pastoral Company by the Tancred Brothers and Conrick family. Peter ‚ÄòWhip' Degoumious became the manager of Nappa Merrie in 2004 when it was still owned by the Stanbroke Pastoral Company. S. Kidman & Co. took up the lease in 2007 for a seven-year period. Bushfires swept through the area in late 2011 burning a large portion of the station resulting in the loss of feed for stock. In November 2016, the property was purchased by Morella Agriculture. Dig Tree Approximately 30,000-35,000 people enter Nappa Merrie every year to visit the heritage-listed Burke and Wills Dig Tree, situated on a small reserve held in the name of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland. The tree was made famous for its part in the Burke and Wills expedition and is situated near Bullah Bullah waterhole, part of Cooper Creek about from the station homestead.

The game was originally released in 2009, and was in development for almost 10 years. Three more years were needed to translate the game into English and it was released on GOG.com on September 5, 2012. On June 1, 2013, Inquisitor was greenlit on Steam.  Gameplay  Inquisitor plays similarly to Baldur's Gate series, being a top-down role-playing game. Firstly, the player chooses his character from the classes of priest, paladin or thief. The player then travels throughout the world, fighting against monsters along the way. The player also investigates crimes against God and the king by finding evidence against the suspect, after which they may be arrested, tortured, and, after conviction, burned at the stake. It is, however, possible to mistakenly arrest innocents should false evidence be found. Evidence in Inquisitor includes the testimony of other characters in the game, as well as items found at location where the crime was committed. It is also possible to draw conclusions from seemingly unrelated information. Found evidence is recorded in character's notebook. The game has an estimated playing time of 100 hours. Inquisitor includes more than 200 weapons, 80 spells and 7 types of magic, alongside over 90 types of monster to combat.  Plot  The setting of Inquisitor is the fictional kingdom of Utherst, in which the omens of the Prophecy of Saint Ezekiel have started to appear, foretelling the end of the world. The game chronicles the efforts of the titular Inquisition to fight against heresy in light of this. The main character Maxmilian ContiProtagonist's name is selectable but he is named Maxmilian Conti in novel and it is also the custom name in the original game. is an Inquisitor who is sent to the town of Hillbrandt to investigate the murder of a local merchant. Maxmilian finds out that the merchant was murdered by Linda von Callagan a wife of a local noble. At first she refuses her guilt but later she confesses due to fear of murder by bishop Vallarian a highest ranking Inquisitor in area. It is revealed that Vallarian is a plotted all problems in Hillbrandt to retrieve an artifact found by the murdered merchant. He used the artifact to summon a demon Arthamon. Vallarian is executed but there are clues indicating that he was a member of an ancient cult trying to bring an apocalypse. Maxmilian leaves Hillbrandt and continues his investigation in Glatzburg. There he seeks a help of a local priest Trevorius. When he gains his trust Trevorius is murdered. In the end the protagonist tracks down another member of the cult who is no less than Cardinal Truncquillius. Truncquillius is also arrested an executed but not before he summons a demon Bafomet to the world. Maxmilian then goes to Alvaron, the capital of the kingdom. He gets there just a short time after death of the king. His investigation leads to his fight to all summoned demons and finding the actual leader of the cult - archbishop Lauentius. When he finds him, player can choose if he wants to join the cult or to stop it. If he joins the cult, Laurentius is killed by a knight who shows up and attacks the player. When the knight is killed player has to defeat Archangel Gabriel. Player then revives the crown prince Louis who has to create a new world order. If player decides to stop the cult he kills Laurentius but has to fight a fallen angel Azrael. When he defeats Azrael, the crown prince Louis is revived and becomes the new king. In outro it is revealed that pope sent a crusade against the kingdom and Louis has to lead his armies to defend the kingdom. Conti's fate is left unknown.  Development  Inquisitor was in development since 1999 when a company Wooden Dragon was founded. The project was financially supported by Cinemax. The game is inspired by Umberto Eco's works such as The Name of the Rose. The original release date was scheduled for 2001. In 2001 the game was delayed to 2002. The new release date wasn't scheduled. In the end the development took 10 years and the game was finally released in November 2009. Developers started to focus on fixing bugs and translation to English. In 2012 the English version was released on GOG and in 2013 on Steam.  Reception  The game received average to positive reviews. It was praised for its story, atmosphere and scope, but was criticized for the quality of its graphics and its high difficulty. *Best Story/Writing on GameBanshee. *RPG France INDIE DE L'ANN√âE 2012.

The house was built about 1830, and is a two-story, five-bay, brick dwelling. The front facade features a two-story, Tuscan order portico with paired full-height columns and no pediment.. Also on the property are a contributing office / guest house, smokehouse, well, corn crib, and stable. and Accompanying photo Set dramatically on a sweeping hillside overlooking the confluence of the James and Rockfish rivers, West Cote, in Albemarle County, Virginia features a two-story, brick, classical revival plantation dwelling built ca. 1830. A well-preserved example of a high-style house of the Early Republican era, it is associated in its design and execution with a group of houses in central Virginia that were constructed by builders who were either involved in or influenced by the construction of the University of Virginia to Thomas Jefferson's designs. Surviving outbuildings include a guesthouse, smokehouse, corncrib and a stable. The unusually wide and deep ante-bellum well is also noteworthy. History What is now West Cote was once a part of large tracts of land assembled in the 1730s and 1740s by Allen Howard. Howard was one of a group of large landholders who were the contemporaries of Peter Jefferson, father of Thomas Jefferson. These men led and promoted the settlement of what eventually became Albemarle and its adjacent counties. Howard and his descendants lived near the confluence of the James and Rockfish rivers. The present house at West Cote was built about 1830 by one of those descendants, William Howard Carter (probably a grandson or great-grandson of Allen Howard). Carter inherited the property in 1826. In 1837 he petitioned to erect a ferry across the James River near West Cote. The architectural and construction details indicate that he built West Cote between these dates. It was an era of house building and a number of large brick mansions rose both on the hills and in the valleys of Albemarle. This came at a time when the building of the University of Virginia was just being completed. This large state project brought to the area a group of skilled workmen, some of whom trained others. Many of both groups remained in the general area and became builders of houses, churches, and courthouses and made changes to older buildings. It is likely that someone who worked on the University buildings or was trained by University workmen built West Cote. Its fine brickwork, impressive portico (Jeffersonian in detail, but not in massing), and geometric front-door transom all are reminiscent of the retired president's idiosyncratic style. By 1840 William Howard Carter was in financial straits. In that year he sold West Cote to Jonathan Crank, a neighbor. Two years later Crank sold the property to William D. Boaz who owned it for 12 years. Boaz sold West Cote in 1856 beginning a succession of six sales until 1893 when Andrew Blair, a \\"prizefighter\\" from Richmond, bought it. The Blair family used West Cote mainly as a retreat and called it \\"Summer Hill\\". They owned it until 1948, the longest family ownership in the history of the property. The next owners were the Covingtons. Susan Byrd, purchased the house in 1997 and sold it in 2008 to the present owners. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. File:West Cote Sign.JPGWest Cote Sign File:West Cote.JPGWest Cote File:Rockfish River, Virginia.JPGRockfish River, Virginia File:West Cote Cemetery.jpgWest Cote Cemetery Description House WestCote's massive brick dwelling rises two stories above a raised basement. The front is of oiled brick in Flemish bond with penciled joints. The north wall is of stock brick in Flemish bond while the other two walls are of five- course American bond. The main facade is five bays wide and features a two- story Tuscan portico with paired full-height columns and no pediment. The portico gives access to the front door, a double door under a large rectangular transom. The transom features tracery in the form of a fan with radiating ribs connected by two rows of swags and a three-petal flower in each of the upper corner quadrants. Over the transom is a lintel with corner blocks that extend beyond the door frame. This combination of elements is typical of buildings that bridge the Roman Revival and Greek Revival styles. The four basement windows have single sashes of nine panes each. The first-floor windows have nine-over-nine sash and the second-floor windows have six-over- six. The house has a low hipped roof covered with standing-seam sheet metal. The portico is crowned by a modern metal railing. The end elevations are unadorned except for the massive cornice and frieze that surrounds the house at the eaves. The cornice is decorated with a beaded molding inspired by an illustration in Asher Benjamin's American Builders Companion, 1805. The rear elevation has the same center door and fenestration as the front. There is a small two-story twentieth-century frame addition in the center of the rear wall. Westcote is an I-house with a center passage plan on each floor. The basement is fully finished and houses a dining room and kitchen. The former has simple trim and the latter has modem but complementary finishes. The upper floors exhibit unusual woodwork combining elements from several different styles. The first-floor doors have eight panels rather than the usual six. These are set in two vertical ranges with three equal horizontal panes over a single tall vertical panel at the base. The door cases are composed of symmetrically molded architraves with roundel comer block. The panels of the reveals correspond to those of the doors. The central passage has single-leaf doors of this design to each of its flanking rooms. The front and rear doors look identical, but are in fact double doors. There is a plastered dado between the simple chair rail and baseboard. The stair rises in one long flight to a transverse landing and returns in a short flight to the upper floor. The rail, however, curves into the transverse section, rather than continuing perpendicular to the runs of the stair. The delicate foliated stair brackets are thereby forced to constrict and form a frieze-like pattern on the curved section. The brackets are similar to ones illustrated in Owen Biddle \\"The Young Carpenter's Assistant\\" (1810). The molded handrail is supported by plain balusters that are square in section. The newel post is delicately fashioned and includes a block surmounted by a round urn-shaped section from which a round tapering column rises to a simple band below a cylinder cap. It is a handsome example of joinery and is related to ones at several other local houses including Mount Fair. The room to the left' of the front door is the parlor. The wooden wainscot is not paneled. The window cases rest on the chair rail and are treated in the same way as the door cases including blocks at the point where the frames meet the chair rail. The reveals are paneled with narrow vertical panels. The most interesting feature of the room is the robust mantel, a local variation of the three-part Adam type. Here coupled fluted colonnettes flank the fireplace opening. In the frieze above, a center panel with an ovoid sunburst is flanked by round sunbursts in square panels. These, in turn, are flanked by pairs of applied turned spools in end blocks which are placed over the colonnettes. There is a thin molded shelf above a band of dentils. Like the stair details, this mantel is related to ones in other nearby houses. It is likely that some of these are the work of a yet unidentified area craftsman. Across the hall is the library similar in detail to the parlor. The mantel is simpler and is flanked by massive eight-panel doors that serve cupboards. On the second floor, as would be expected, the finishes are simpler than those on the first floor. The east room mantel has fluted pilasters and a tall paneled frieze. The center panel features a motif with a diamond-shaped center with quadrant-cut corners. The mantel in the west room is similar, but more conventional, with three identical plain rectangular frieze panels. Office Standing in the southwest corner of the front yard is a one-story, two-bay frame structure that may be somewhat earlier than the main dwelling. It is about a 16 feet square, has a gable roof and contains one room and a finished loft. The interior was heavily altered in the 20th century. The off-center five-course American-bond end chimney is probably a late 19th-century replacement. The building is typical of ones that were common in plantation complexes throughout the state. The Smokehouse stands on the east side of the main house. It is a one-bay, gable- roofed frame building of weatherboards with a slate roof. It is built entirely of circular-sawn members and probably dates from the late 19th century. Between the smokehouse and the dwelling is a massive circular brick-lined well. 'The well is about eight feet in diameter. The water surface is about 75 feet from the top and the total depth is just under 100 feet. It is one of the largest known hand- dug wells in Virginia. It is assumed to have been dug by slaves soon after the house was constructed. Standing about 75 yards northwest of the main house, the corncrib was built with ground-to-plate post construction, a form of construction that was common in early Virginia, but certainly not at the end of the 19th century when it is assumed this structure was built. To further complicate the analysis of the crib, timbers from a much earlier building were reused in its construction. There are members marked with Roman numerals that obviously have no relationship to each other either numerically or structurally. It is a rectangular structure 9 by 15 feet, with the gable end to the front. The roof is covered with standing-seam metal. The walls are sheathed with vertical wood slats one to two inches wide secured with cut nails. These were used to facilitate ventilation to keep the corn from mildewing. In the 20th century fine wire mesh was nailed around the exterior to keep out animals. The unusual construction of the front gable in what resembles the Stick Style, with projecting plate and return cornice, suggests that it may have been built around 1900 when the property was owned by the Blair family. Except for this detailing, the building is unornamented. The front door is of plain batten construction and swings on large iron strap hinges. A wrought-iron hasp secures the door to the jamb. Wire nails used on the door and other areas indicate that the building underwent repairs in the 20th century. Stable The building appears to be an early 20th-century building with an asymmetrical gable roof. It is covered with vertical board sheathing and a slate roof. Local workers familiar with West Cote recalled several years ago that the present barn and another one lost about 50 years ago were moved from the flats on the Rockfish River below the house.

It is the third video game title in the Samorost series and the sequel to Samorost 2. It is the first game in the series that is full-length and with high-definition graphics. The story takes place across five planets and four moons. The game was originally scheduled for 2015. Samorost 3 has sold over 300,000 units as of February 2017. Development The development started in 2010. Samorost 3 was developed by a team of about six people. Developers drew artistic inspiration from animated films by Czech directors like Karel Zeman, Jan ≈†vankmajer, Ji≈ô√≠ Barta or B≈ôetislav Pojar. Another source of inspiration were films by Russian animator Yuriy Norshteyn. The game consists of 45 screens that were changed many times during development. Another important part of development was sound recording. It was created by people making weird noises in microphones. These people include B√°ra Kratochv√≠lov√° and Milo≈° Dvo≈ô√°ƒçek. Other sounds were created by Tom√°≈° Dvo≈ô√°k as he used multiple instruments, such as a lollipop used to a strum, to create required sounds. Dvo≈ô√°k also composed the music for the game. Samorost 3 was released on 24 March 2016 for Steam, and 3 December 2016 for Android. Gameplay Samorost 3 features gameplay similar to previous Amanita Design games. The game contains no comprehensible dialogue, only a system of animated thought bubbles and gibberish. The player controls Gnome on his journey through space full of planets, equipped with an inventory and a flute. He explores the environment, solves puzzles and collects items required for the obstacles that come in his way. He can also communicate with creatures he meets during his journey. These creatures include ghosts who need Gnome's help. The player can also use a flute that is required to solve some puzzles. Samorost 3 features a walkthrough that can be accessed at any time by playing a minigame if the player gets stuck. The walkthrough is not in written or spoken form, but instead a series of sketches describing the puzzle at hand and its solution. Plot Samorost 3 starts when a magical flute falls near the Gnome's house. The Gnome decides to find out where it came from and sets out on a journey through the cosmos. He speaks to an engineer and asks him to build a toadstool rocket, which he builds by reusing parts found scattered on his home planet. The Gnome flies from planet to planet and meets multiple creatures whom he helps with their problems using the flute. The Gnome eventually discovers two illustrated books and learns that the flute belongs to four monks. Not long ago, the monks were all at peace, until a giant orange space octopus arrived from a black wormhole and started consuming planets. The monks saw the octopus coming and consulted an engineer (the same one from the Gnome's home planet) to build a three-headed watering spaceship controlled by the flutes on the back of which they can fly, and a mechanical knight powered by a black orb with which to fight the octopus and save the universe. The knight dismembers and kills the octopus, then the knight goes to sleep on a moon, and the orb is locked away and protected by a guardian monk. In the second book, one of the four monks uses his flute to create evil spirits, and the other three monks banish him for doing so. He secretly takes the spaceship and converts it into a three-headed fire-breathing mechanical dragon. Flying on the dragon, he snatches the other three flutes from the monks and casts the monks out of their mountain castle. However one of the flutes flew away, and this is the flute that landed on the Gnome's planet. He then uses the dragon to consume good spirits which he finds on other planets and then seizes the black orb so that the knight cannot be awakened. The Gnome eventually reaches the planet of monks, sneakily steals the black orb from the evil monk, and uses it to revive the mechanical knight who then slays the dragon and presumably killing the evil monk in the process. The Gnome celebrates by playing music with the remaining three monks, who reward him with the power to travel instantly across all the planets and returns the black orb to its guarded storage. The Gnome finally returns to his home planet to greet his dog. Reception Samorost 3 has generally been well received by critics. It currently holds 80/100 on Metacritic. The Washington Post called Samorost 3 \\"a strange and beautiful point-and-click adventure game.\\" T review likened Samorost 3 to Loom as both games \\"feature a hooded main character (gnome) who channels magic out of music.\\" The review praised the animation and surrealistic visuals. Another point of praise was a hint system that can spare players of frustration. The review finished with a recommendation for parents who \\"look for something to play with their young children.\\" Kill Screen review called Samorost 3 \\"The best adventure game in years\\". The review praised the design of the game world and its visuals. The game was also praised for its explorative gameplay that gives players a feeling of exploration. Kotaku included Samorost 3 in its list of titles with the best video game music of 2016. Samorost 3 was nominated for the 13th annual Global International Mobile Gaming Awards in 2017.

Facts  The appellant was convicted in a regional court of attempted rape. He committed the crime barely a month after being convicted of crimen iniuria, assault and malicious injury to property, for which offences he had received a suspended sentence. When he committed the attempted rape, the appellant was twenty-three years and the complainant sixteen years of age. In sentencing the appellant, the magistrate took into account the prevalence of rape in the area: > Hardly a day goes by without the local courts dealing with one or more of > these cases. And, as the prosecutor has indicated, they seem to be on the > increase. It seems that the short terms of imprisonment which have been > imposed in the past have not acted as sufficient deterrent. Parliament has > set its face against this type of offence and has provided for the death > penalty to be imposed in appropriate cases. He found that, when the appellant committed the offence, he knew exactly what he was doing, but accepted in his favour that at the time he had been intoxicated to some extent. The magistrate took into account the circumstances which prevailed when the appellant committed the offence, addressing the appellant thus: > You had the complainant at your mercy, pulled her around by the hair, > assaulted her, humiliated her and attempted to rape her. You are a big > strong person and she had no chance against you. Fortunately you did not > succeed in deflowering her. Had that happened the court would have taken a > much more serious view of this incident. But it was purely fortuitous that > she was not deflowered. Had you not ejaculated prematurely she might not > have been a virgin today. In rape cases, the magistrate pointed out, it was not only the victim who had an interest in the outcome of the case. If the sentence were too lenient, interested and affected persons might take the law in their own hands. He referred to R v Karg,1961 (1) SA 231 (A). where Schreiner JA said, > It is not wrong that natural indignation of interested persons and of the > community at large should receive some recognition in the sentence that the > Courts impose, and it is not irrelevant to bear in mind that, if sentences > for serious crimes are too lenient, the administration of justice may fall > into disrepute and injured persons may incline to take the law into their > own hands.236. The magistrate had regard, finally, to the criminal record of the appellant. He expressed the view that the court had a duty towards women, and was obliged to protect them against men like the appellant. The only way that could be done was by imposing an appropriate sentence, he said, and held that, under all the circumstances, a suspended sentence, as suggested by counsel for the appellant, would be inappropriate. The magistrate dealt with the appellant's previous record as follows: > You are by no means a first offender. Your first brush with the law was on > 27 April 1976, when you received five cuts following a conviction for theft. > Since then you have been convicted of various other offences and your > history shows a singular lack of discipline. You have become a liability to > society. You committed the present offence whilst the suspended sentence, > dated 20 February 1979, was hanging over your head. Your counsel has > explained the nature of the crimen injuria offence and the court will accept > what he said, namely that there was no physical involvement in that incident > and that what had happened is that you had sworn at a woman which led to > that conviction and sentence. The aims which the magistrate had therefore in mind were, in the first instance, deterrence of the appellant himself and, in view of the prevalence of rape and, indeed, an increase of rape cases heard by the courts, deterrence also of others. In view of the offence of rape being one of those offences which evokes public indignation, and in view of the character and personality of the appellant, as revealed by his criminal record, the magistrate added a fair measure of retribution. He obviously decided against a suspended sentence because the suspended sentence which had previously been imposed upon the appellant had not had any deterrent or corrective effect upon him. It had hardly been imposed when the appellant committed the present offence of attempted rape. The magistrate accordingly sentenced him to five years' imprisonment.  Argument  His appeal to a provincial division failed; he then appealed to the Appellate Division against the sentence imposed upon him. It was submitted on behalf of the appellant # that the magistrate had misdirected himself in over-emphasizing the deterrent and retributive aspects of punishment in assessing an appropriate punishment; # that, regard being had to other sentences imposed in similar cases, the sentence in the present case was strikingly disparate; and # that the court had failed to take into account certain mitigating factors. In support of his first submission, counsel referred the Appellate Division to the recent decision in S v Khumalo,1984 (3) SA 327 (A). where, Nicholas JA, in the course of his majority judgment, said, > In the assessment of an appropriate sentence, regard must be had inter alia > to the main purposes of punishment mentioned by Davis AJA in R v Swanepoel > 1945 AD 444 at 455, namely deterrent, preventive, reformative and > retributive (see S v Whitehead 1970 (4) SA 424 (A) at 436E-F; S v Rabie 1975 > (4) SA 855 (A) at 862). > Deterrence has been described as the \\"essential\\", \\"all important\\", > \\"paramount\\" and \\"universally admitted\\" object of punishment. See R v > Swanepoel (supra at 455). The other objects are accessory.330D-E. Nicholas JA also remarked that, in modern times, retribution was considered to be of lesser importance, and referred to the very dictum which the magistrate quoted from Karg, adding, however, the following sentence which was omitted by the magistrate: \\"Naturally, righteous anger should not becloud judgment.\\" Nicholas JA referred as well to the following dictum by Holmes JA in S v Rabie:1975 (4) SA 855 (A). > The main purposes of punishment are deterrent, preventive, reformative and > retributive: see R v Swanepoel 1945 AD 444 at 455. As pointed out in Gordon > Criminal Law of Scotland (1967) at 50: > \\"The retributive theory finds the justification for punishment in a past > act, a wrong which requires punishment or expiation ... The other theories, > reformative, preventive and deterrent, all find their justification in the > future, in the good that will be produced as a result of the punishment.\\" > It is therefore not surprising that in R v Karg 1961 (1) SA 231 (A) at 236A > Schreiner JA observed that, while the deterrent effect of punishment has > remained as important as ever, > \\"the retributive aspect has tended to yield ground to the aspect of > prevention and correction\\".862A-B.  Judgment  Viljoen JA subscribed fully to these views. Whereas formerly, \\"particularly in ancient and medieval times and even in the more enlightened period thereafter,\\" retribution was emphasised, \\"the outlook has gradually changed.\\" In his De Jure Belli ac Pacis, Grotius wrote, \\"nemo prudens pun it quia peccatum sed ne peccatur.\\"2.20.4.1. While, in Viljoen JA's estimation, this was true, retribution was, as Schreiner JA had said, by no means absent from the modern approach. What importance the component of retribution should be accorded in a sentence \\"depends,\\" wrote Viljoen JA, \\"upon the circumstances.\\" In Karg, for instance, the Appellate Division considered whether mere negligence as opposed to recklessness, or some high degree of recklessness, merited a considerable degree of retribution in the sentence. As was made clear in the same case, an offence which evoked indignation from the public would attract a greater share of the component of retribution than an offence which did not. Further factors to be taken into account in this respect were the seriousness of the offence and the disposition and attitude of the offender, particularly to his victim. In the present case, one of the ingredients of the offence, Viljoen JA held, was intent, not negligence. The complainant, a girl of sixteen years, was seriously manhandled by the appellant, who showed no remorse afterwards. The magistrate had correctly taken into account his previous criminal history. This showed a singular lack of discipline, said the magistrate, who correctly described him as a liability to society. In Viljoen JA's view, the magistrate had not overemphasised the retributive aspect. Viljoen JA also believed that the magistrate had correctly applied the deterrent aims, as far as the appellant himself as well as others were concerned. Considering that his previous sentences had had no deterrent effect upon him, as was illustrated by the commission of the present offence on March 26, 1979, barely a month after a portion of each of his sentences imposed on February 20, 1979,Crimen injuria, assault on a white male and a police officer, and malicious injury to property. was suspended for three years on various conditions, the magistrate had not erred as far as deterrence of himself was concerned. The prevalence of the offence and the increase thereof was no doubt taken into account by the magistrate, Viljoen JA believed, in the context of his aim to deter not only the appellant himself, but also others. For that reason, it would not serve any purpose, as the appellant's counsel had invited the Appellate Division to do, to compare other sentences imposed for the same offence. Of course, a comparison of sentences meted out in other cases might serve as a guide to ensure some proportionality in sentences, but it was only a rough guide, according to Viljoen JA, because there were so many factors to be taken into account‚Äîthey could be usefully collected under the term \\"individualisation\\"‚Äîthat no tariff or standard sentence could be maintained. One such factor was the personal circumstances of the offender. In the present case it was in fact submitted that the magistrate had not sufficiently taken into account the appellant's personal circumstances. From the record, Viljoen JA found very little as to the appellant's employment, his future prospects of advancement, the effect which a prison sentence was likely to have upon his life, and other such circumstances. Since he was represented at the trial, it might be assumed that, if any such personal circumstances, likely to affect the sentence, did in fact exist, they would have been brought to the notice of the magistrate. Viljoen JA conceded that the sentence was a heavy one, but found that the magistrate had furnished good reasons for imposing it. As, furthermore, he had not erred in any respect, and as the sentence was not so severe as to lead to the conclusion that no reasonable court would have imposed it, the appeal was duly dismissed.

It is endemic to North America. It is an arid land specialist, living for many years as a cyst and bursting into life at the arrival of rains, maturing rapidly in temporary pools and producing eggs that can remain dormant until the next rains occur, perhaps in many years time. Description Desert shrimps are sexually dimorphic. The males have their front two pairs of thoracic appendages modified into claws while the hermaphrodites have unmodified legs. Distribution and habitat Desert shrimps live in ditches, ponds, pools and other ephemeral freshwater habitats in northern Mexico and parts of the southern and southwestern United States, west of the Mississippi River. Biology Individual shrimps are either male or hermaphrodite. The hermaphrodites can fertilize their own eggs or can mate with males but are unable to mate with other hermaphrodites. This arrangement is called androdioecy and is very rare among animals. The reproductive cycle varies between paired shrimps and isolated hermaphrodites and it is possible that using both strategies enhances the likelihood that fertile eggs will be available when the ephemeral water body in which they live dries up. Although to biologists, androdioecy seems a strategy unlikely to be successful, research using biogeographical, phylogenetic and paleontological evidence has shown that the practice has persisted in the genus Eulimnadia for 24 to 180 million years. The shrimps are omnivores and filter feeders, able to feed on the algae and microorganisms that also make use of the revived pool. Life cycle In the Mojave Desert, standing water occurs for only a short time after it rains. Storms are a rare event, and when a downpour occurs in the summer (making the water warm enough), eggs of the desert shrimp spring into life. They have been lying in the dust and baked clay of a dried up pool in a dormant state for years, looking like grains of sand. The nauplius larvae which hatch out grow with great rapidity. They undergo metamorphosis and reach a reproductive size in four to seven days. Each hermaphrodite then produces clutches of up to 300 eggs once or twice a day. By the twelfth day of their lives, they may be long. During the course of their short lives, each may produce thousands of eggs. If time allows, several generations may occur. When the water evaporates and little remains of their pool, they dig a hole in the mud and bury their eggs as the water level falls. By the time the pool has dried, the shrimps are desiccated corpses. However, their eggs live on, waiting for the next rainstorm which may be decades away. During the intervening years, desert winds may carry away some of the eggs and a few may end up in locations where water accumulates after rain. This allows the shrimp to colonize new areas without traveling while active.

In 1673, Antonio Gonz√°les de Acu√±a bought a number of buildings in the area around today's Plaza Mayor, adapting them to serve as a seminary. Known as the Colegio Seminario de Santa Rosa de Lima, it was the first seminary of the seventeenth century. It incorporated the features of the old chapel. Little by little, the seminary evolved as an institute of higher learning until in 1725 Juan Jos√© de Escalona y Calatayud, Bishop of Caracas, created the Real y Pontificia Universidad de Caracas which in 1810 became the Universidad de Los Andes, later renamed Universidad Central de Venezuela by Bol√≠var. In 1872, the building was renovated by President Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco as the Palacio de Justicia (Supreme Court of Venezuela). The western pavilion was added in 1881. Further renovations and adaptations from 1904 to 1906 were undertaken on the initiative of President Cipriano Castro by the architect Alejandro Chataing (1873‚Äì1928). In 1979, the building was listed as a national monument. The edifice was the focal point for the Constitutional Convention, and signing of the Declaration of Independence in the nineteenth century (declared on 5 July 1811 and hence known as the \\"cradle of independence\\"), the installation of the de la Academia de Matem√°ticas, and operation of the Cabildo de Caracas. On Christmas Eve 1809, Bolivar made plans to storm city hall with other Creoles but was stopped by a military officer.

It is built in an eclectic Neoclassical style with three storeys along the main fa√ßade. The main entrance is flanked by double pillars in the composite order. It is crowned by a balcony decorated with composite pilasters and a triangular frontispiece. The east fa√ßade is also decorated with composite pillars designed to resemble those of the Roman Forum or similar works from antiquity.

Life Stanis≈Çaw Kubista was born on September 27, 1898 in Kostuchna near Miko≈Ç√≥w in the present diocese of Katowice to Stanis≈Çaw and Franciszka Czempska. He was the fifth child out of six sons and three daughters. Gertruda, the youngest daughter and his youngest sister (born in 1910) is still alive. Stanis≈Çaw Kubista was a perplexed, but noted, man for his eagerness to learn and to serve. In 1917, he was sent to the French Front to serve as a radio and telegraph operator until 1919, when he was recalled in Poland. In 1927, after years of gruelling training, and suffering to become a priest, he was ordained. During his schooling in the seminar, he was noted to be a good writer; especially in the Polish language. In 1928, he was appointed sub rector of Gorna Grupa (where later on, fellow martyr Aloysius Liguda would be the main rector). He later realized that life was everywhere, it was all around him. Until October 27, 1940, the priest wrote stage plays and publication, as well as procuring things needed for the community and for the people in the seminary.

He was a supporter of John Wilkes. Thomas Holloway Early life He was born near Ravenstone, in a house on the Derbyshire-Leicestershire border, on 2 December 1730, the fourth son and youngest child of John Mawbey (died 4 September 1754 aged 61), by his first wife, Martha, daughter of Thomas Pratt (died in September 1737). Both parents were buried at Ravenstone, where Joseph erected in 1764 a mural monument in the church. When about ten years old he was taken to Surrey by his uncle, Joseph Pratt, main owner of a distillery at Vauxhall. Mawbey was taken into the business at the age of 17, and carried it on for many years with his brother John. In politics On his uncle's death in 1754, Mawbey inherited property in Surrey and established himself as a landed proprietor. He was High Sheriff of Surrey in 1757, bought the estate of Botleys in Chertsey in 1763, on which he built a large house, and for a quarter of a century was chairman of the Surrey quarter sessions. From 1761 to 1768 and from 1768 to 1774 he sat for Southwark, his colleague in the two- member constituency being Henry Thrale from 1765. He was created a baronet (30 July 1765) as a political ally by the Marquess of Rockingham.Mawbey, Joseph (1730-98), of Botleys, Surr. John Dixon after Robert Edge Pine On 14 November 1768 John Wilkes presented a petition through Mawbey. It covered points including the case brought over The North Briton, an allegation that Lord Mansfield had altered a record, and an allegation that Philip Carteret Webb had bribed Michael Curry, Wilkes's printer and a witness. Speeches by Mawbey on the proceedings against Wilkes were later published, in the Debates by Sir Henry Cavendish, 2nd Baronet. Mawbey was a significant force in the Bill of Rights Society that gave Wilkes practical support, and took Wilkes's side in the internal struggle, leading to a split in the Society, with supporters of John Horne. In 1774 Mawbey contested the county of Surrey, but was defeated, though with 1,390 votes, by a cross-party agreement brokered by George Onslow who saw no chance of his own re-election; Sir Francis Vincent, 7th Baronet and James Scawen were returned.historyofparliamentonline.org, The Elections (1754‚Äì1790).

In 1790, however, he was defeated by William Clement Finch who had Treasury backing.historyofparliamentonline.org, Finch, Hon. William Clement (1753-94), of Albury, Surr. Death Mawbey then ceased to sit in parliament.

Works Mawbey was author of The Battle of Epsom.

One of the translations of Lord Belgrave's quotation in the \\"Political Miscellanies\\" at the end of the Rolliad is assigned to him. In several instalments in the Gentleman's Magazine (1791 to 1797), Mawbey wrote a chatty biography of \\"Hesiod\\" Cooke. He took Cooke's side in criticism of David Mallet.

The prohibition was taken over from an earlier Act, in which the purchase of opium was expressly declared a crime. In the new Act, which replaced the previous one, the criminal sanction (the provisions declaring the purchase to be a crime) was omitted. The court remarked as follows: > If this omission were intentional, then the Legislature considered either > that the common law provided a penalty or that no penalty should be imposed > at all. The latter conclusion is negatived by the whole tenor of those > statutes [... T]he reasonable assumption is that the Legislature, whilst > intending the prohibition to be absolute and effective, overlooked the > absence of any expressed penalty [...]. It is clear that no law of this kind > can be effective without a penalty; and the argument that the Courts must > therefore be held to have the power to inflict a penalty, wherever the > Legislature has intended to create an offence, is of considerable > weight.53-54. The court concluded: \\"We have come to the conclusion that the same principle applies in Roman-Dutch law, and that as the act in question was expressly an offence, it is punishable under our law.\\"56. The court relied among other things on a rule which it formulated as follows: \\"The doing of an act which is expressly forbidden by the Legislature upon grounds of public policy constitutes an indictable offence, even though no penalty be attached.\\"55. The principle laid down in Forlee was followed in the Appellate Division in R v Langley1931 CPD 31. and R v Baraitser,1931 CPD 418. but was strongly criticised by academics including De Wet and Swanepoel,Strafreg 4th ed at 46-47. and Rabie and Strauss.Punishment: An Introduction to Principles 4th ed at 79-80. In the view of CR Snyman, > If the Legislature inadvertently omits the criminal norm, then the > Legislature itself should correct the error.

The magazine featured graphics, jokes and reports. Disrespectful and stridently non- conformist in tone, the publication described its characteristics as \\"short\\", \\"hilarious\\" and \\"Hong Kong style\\". The slogan of 100Most is \\"ÁúãÂæóÂÆåÔºåÂâõÂâõÂ•Ω\\" (English: \\"Just Right\\"). Its 275th and final weekly issue was published on 12 July 2018, after which the magazine was only published in digital format. History The magazine was founded by Roy Tsui, Bu and Chan Keung (ÊûóÊó•Êõ¶, Èô≥Âº∑, ÂßöÂÆ∂Ë±™), mainstays of Blackpaper. Its first issue appeared on 7 March 2013. The name 100Most is translated from its Chinese name 100ÊØõ. ÊØõ means hair or 10 cents in Mandarin Chinese literally. 100 represents the 100 focuses listed out in each issue. 100Most was one of the most famous magazines in Hong Kong, according to Roy Tsui, each issue reaching 80-90% sales in 2016. The target reader of this magazine is mainly post-eighties. The magazine was published every Thursday, with special editions issued on an unscheduled basis.  Style  The philosophy of 100Most was \\"Short, Hilarious and \\"Hong Kong style\\". The founders believed that the life of Hong Kongers is hectic and tense. They wanted to write something to make them laugh and to arouse discussion. It targeted young adults below 40 as its readers. The publishing team of the magazine consisted of people born in the 80s and 90s. Each issue of 100Most was largely written in Cantonese, including colloquial expressions. A major characteristic of each focus in 100Most was that it was kept short yet concise, with each focus in roughly 200 words. This moderate length suited the appetites of the young generation, favouring brief quality articles or news as opposed to lengthy passages. The topics of 100Most were related to daily life and diversified, ranging from social issues to political issues. The writers put great emphasis on freedom of speech. The founder, Roy Tsui, spurned any self-censorship. Therefore, the magazine content was usually subjective, mainly consisting of personal opinions without much evidence-based research. Moreover, the magazine itself took a strong political stance, which could be reflected by its use of words and colours . For example, in its 89th issue (published on 11 November 2014), black and yellow, symbols of the pro- democracy Umbrella Movement, were used as the background colours in some of the pages. Another characteristic of 100Most was its use of graphics. Excel charts were commonly used to illustrate social issues. According to Chan Keung, the use of Excel charts helped deliver ideas in a clear and understandable way.  Controversy  100Most was often placed at the centre of the copyright infringement disputes. The first dispute could be dated back to late 2013, in which 100Most was accused of plagiarism after publishing an excerpt of a review of Bounty Lady without giving credit to the author, Lunyeah, a local blogger in Hong Kong and reducing him as \\"È£üÈ£ΩÈ£ØÁÑ°sÂ±ôÂòÖÁ∂≤Ê∞ë\\" (a netizen who makes troubles out of nothing). This led to a heated debate on social media. Lunyeah made a statement on Facebook, saying that he was disappointed by 100Most and it is a common knowledge that citation is necessary when using others' ideas and thoughts. He was also angry about being denounced while his work was stolen. In December 2015, 100Most stated on its social media platform TV Most that Roy Tsui had apologised to Lunyeah at various occasions and Lunyeah accepted it. In early 2015, 100Most was once again involved in copyright infringement after using images of Doraemon in the special edition that paid tribute to the late Doraemon voice actor Lam Pou- chuen who died on 2 January 2015. The public questioned whether 100Most infringed copyright. On 9 January Animation International Ltd. (AIL), copyright owner of Doraemon, said to Apple Daily, stating that their staff were working on the infringement while Roy Tsui claimed that he was not familiar with the issue. One day later Tsui said he would not respond on this issue anymore because he has received a legal statement from AIL.

He was the first Mizo to obtain the degrees of BSc and BD. He died of cardiac problem on the morning of 17 December 2008 at his residence in Aizawl at the age of 91. He is best remembered as the \\"father of Mizoram Synod\\". Early life and education Zairema was born in Hmunhmel·π≠ha, a small village in the eastern Mizoram. He was the eldest of the three sons of Doliana Khawlhring and Aibuani. His father Doliana was among the first literate Mizos and was an elementary school teacher at Champhai (Chawnchhim). Zairema was baptised by the first Mizo Pastor Vanchhunga on 2 September 1917. His father died from falling off of a tree in 1922 so that they were raised solely by his widowed mother. He studied at Champhai Primary School from 1922 to 1924. He completed his elementary education from Government Boys' ME School (then Sikulpui) at Aizawl in 1931 in first class. He matriculated in first class from Government High School at Shillong, Meghalaya, in 1936. He continued at Cotton College, Guwahati for Intermediate of Science (ISc), which he finished with first class, and then BSc with major in chemistry in 1940. He was immediately appointed as headmaster at the Harasinga High School. But after two years in 1943, to fulfil his real ambition, he joined Serampore College from where he completed Bachelor of Divinity in 1945 in first class. He made a record of the institute as the first in the merit and the first to have secured first class under the entire Senate of Serampore College. Career and professional achievements Immediately on completion of his theology course, Zairema was recruited by the Mizoram Synod (the then North Lushai Assembly, now under the Presbyterian Church of India) and he was officially ordained as a full minister of Presbyterian Church on 23 September 1945. Instead of the usual pastoral ministry, the first major and immediate task assigned to him was to prepare the complete Mizo version of the Holy Bible, of which some New Testament and very few Old Testament were already (mostly in parts) translated by British missionaries. At the behest of the community, the church arranged part-time duty as a teacher at the newly established Mizo High School, Zarkawt, Aizawl, from 1945; and was designated as Assistant Headmaster in 1948. With collaboration from the Baptist Church, he completed the full Bible in Mizo in 1959. In 1946, he was appointed as the Assembly Secretary of the Mizoram Synod, and became the Assembly Moderator for the year 1953. Between 1954 and 1859 he held the office of Education Secretary of the new Mizoram Synod. Between 1959 and 1967 he managed the mission field at Cachar, Assam while serving as the Assembly Officer of PCI. He was elected to PCI Secretary in 1953 and Moderator in 1959. In 1968 he was elected as the first General Secretary of the Mizoram Synod, the office of which he took up in August. When the secretarial office was extended he became the Senior Executive Secretary from 1974 and remained till 1981. He was once again Moderator Elect in 1975. From 1963 to 1996 he served as the active leader as the Chief Translator in the revision of the Mizo Bible under the initiative of the Bible Society of India. Unfortunately, even though the project was completed, the revised Bible has never been officially endorsed due to publication errors. He retired from Synod office in 1982.  Other academic and social works  When Mizoram was clouded by the terrors and atrocities of the political uprising in 1966, Rev. Zairema was the main leader of the coordinated action of all churches in Mizoram for seeking peaceful settlement among the rebels, the Mizo National Front. He was even imprisoned for 11 days in 1967 by the Assam Police on a deliberate accusation of inciting and accessing the rebels, and was later simply acquitted. He was an official consultant of Mizoram Government such as in the planning board, land tenure system, council of science, civil service examination, school education, language board, customary law, etc. He was a regular examiner of Calcutta University and Gauhati University undergraduate examinations from 1946 to 1970. He was the only subject expert in Mizo for the recruitment of teaching faculty of Mizoram University in 2005. Upon the permission of the church, he served as the Vice-President of Mizo Union, the first political party in Mizoram, from 1946 to 1947. In 1957 he was approved by the Mizoram Synod for candidacy in the Member of Parliament election to Lok Sabha as an independent candidate. But nomination was not filed. In 1959 he was a fully nominated MP candidate, but lost the election. He was one of the most active leaders in the Young Mizo Association, the largest organisation in Mizoram. He hold the office as Vice-President in 1946 and 1949, and general secretary in 1947. In 1982, following his professional retirement he, along with other enthusiasts, established nongovernmental organisations called Vigilance Council and Mizoram Guardians to fight against political corruption. Personal life and death Zairema was a conservative theologian and a rigorous pacifist. His attempt to restore peace from the Mizoram insurgency of 1966 was extraordinary, personally struggling his ways between the rebel leaders in the deep jungle and central government officials of India (Prime Minister, Home Minister and Home Secretary). A notable political figure, A. Thanglura, even dubbed him as one of the three blind mice of the insurgency because of his often futile but unfeigned actions. His commitment to political and social justice was best exemplified by his Public Interest Litigation petition to the Supreme Court of India against corruption. He initiated the case in 1996 that lasted even after his death. This particularly affected the Chief Minister Lalthanhawla on charges of bribery for which the minister was summoned to police and court numerous times. He married Thangdailovi on 4 March 1943, and they lived at Zarkawt, McDonald Hill, Aizawl. His wife died on 6 March 2003. He spent his last days with a heart problem. On 17 December 2008, 0600 hr (local time) he was pronounced dead due to cardiac failure, at the age of 91, in his residence at Zarkawt. He was survived by a son (2 died in their youths), 4 daughters, and 17 grandchildren.  Recognitions and awards On 2 February 1988, the Serampore University conferred him the degree of Doctor of Divinity (honoris causa) for his contribution in theology, specifically on the preparation of the Mizo Bible. On 2 July 1991 the North Eastern Hill University decorated him with a Doctor of Literature (honoris causa) for his contributions to Mizo literature. The Mizo Academy of Letters awarded his theological memoire Kan Bible Hi as the Book of the Year 2003. His subsequent book Pipute Biak Hi was a runner-up of the Book of the Year 2009. He was posthumously awarded Academy Award 2007‚Äì2010 of the Mizo Academy of Letters, the most prestigious award in Mizoram, on 26 November 2010 for his significant contributions in Mizo literature. The award carried a citation, a medal and cash prize of INR 10,000. In 2011, a registered society, Zairema Memorial Society, was established in his honour with an objective of working for social justice and development.

It deals with that subdivision of the principle of legality known as the ius acceptum rule in statutory crimes: the rule stipulating that a court may convict an accused of a crime only if the type of act which he committed is recognised by the law‚Äîin this instance the statutory law as a crime.Snyman Casebook 25.  Facts  The accused, who had been an inmate of a rehabilitation centre, was charged with having absconded from the centre: that is, of having run away from the centre without the permission of the superintendent of the centre. The State charged the accused with contravening a certain regulation,Regulation 84(j). promulgated in terms of an Act of 1971 which dealt with rehabilitation centres. This regulation made it clear that the act which the accused had allegedly committed constituted a crime. In 1992, however, the 1971 Act, as well as the regulations promulgated in terms of it, was repealed and replaced by a new Act, which dealt with the same topic. The 1992 Act contained no provisions creating crimes: that is, no provision stating clearly that a certain act or failure to comply with a certain provision in the Act or any regulation constituted a crime. The accused's alleged absconding from the rehabilitation centre took place in 1993. At that time the 1971 Act was no longer in force; it had been replaced by the 1992 Act. The question the court had to decide was whether there existed any crime under which the accused could be charged.  Judgment  Ackermann J found it to be very significant that, considering the provisions of the earlier 1971 Act in this regard, the 1992 Act made no mention of any criminal jurisdiction of the magistrate's court. At first glance this was a strong indication that the legislature wished to remove from the criminal sphere the maintenance of discipline in the treatment centres and registered treatment centres, and to leave these matters exclusively in the hands of the superintendent of these centres (or another person who had been appointed for this purpose by the management of the centre). The principle of legality was also of importance here. Ackermann J agreed with Snyman:Strafreg 3rd ed at 33. In criminal law this principle \\"fulfils,\\" as Snyman put it, \\"the important task of preventing the arbitrary punishment of people by state officials, and of ensuring that the determination of criminal liability and the passing of sentence correspond with clear and existing rules of law.\\"Translated by Snyman Casebook 23. In this respect Snyman distinguished between a legal norm, a criminal norm and a criminal sanction, and illustrated the differences as follows: > A statutory prohibition may be stated in one of the following three ways: > (a) you may not travel on a train without a ticket; > (b) you may not travel on a train without a ticket and anybody contravening > this provision shall be guilty of a criminal offence; > (c) you may not travel on a train without a ticket and anybody contravening > this provision shall be guilty of an offence and punishable with > imprisonment for a maximum period of three months or a maximum fine of R600, > or both such imprisonment and fine. > Provision (a) contains a simple prohibition that constitutes a legal norm, > but not a norm in which a crime is created. Although non-fulfilment of the > regulation may well lead to administrative action (such as putting the > passenger off at the next stop) it does not contain a criminal norm. A court > will not, without strong and convincing indications to the contrary, hold > that such a regulation has created a crime. Provision (b) does contain a > criminal norm, because of the words \\"shall be guilty of an offence\\". > However, it does not contain a criminal sanction because there is no mention > of the punishment that should be imposed. Provision (c) contains both a > criminal norm and criminal sanction. The criminal sanction is contained in > the words \\"and be punishable with imprisonment for a maximum period of three > months or a maximum fine of R600, or both such imprisonment and fine\\". If a > statutory provision creates a criminal norm only, but remains silent on the > criminal sanction, as in provision (b) above, the punishment is simply at > the court's discretion, that is, the court itself can decide what punishment > to impose. In the unlikely event of a statutory provision containing a > criminal sanction, but not a criminal norm, in all probability the court > will decide that the legislature undoubtedly intended to create a crime, and > will assume that a crime was indeed created.\\"41-42.Translated by Snyman > Casebook 23. As Snyman then pointed out, however, South African courts had not always strictly observed these principles. In R v Forlee,1917 TPD 52. the accused was charged with contravening a statutory provision which forbade the purchase of opium. The prohibition was taken over from an earlier Act in which the purchase of opium was expressly declared a crime. In the new Act, which replaced the previous one, the criminal sanction (the provisions declaring the purchase to be a crime) was omitted. the Court remarked as follows: > If this omission were intentional, then the Legislature considered either > that the common law provided a penalty or that no penalty should be imposed > at all. The latter conclusion is negatived by the whole tenor of those > statutes [... T]he reasonable assumption is that the Legislature, whilst > intending the prohibition to be absolute and effective, overlooked the > absence of any expressed penalty [...]. It is clear that no law of this kind > can be effective without a penalty; and the argument that the Courts must > therefore be held to have the power to inflict a penalty, wherever the > Legislature has intended to create an offence, is of considerable > weight.53-54. The court concluded: \\"We have come to the conclusion that the same principle applies in Roman-Dutch law, and that as the act in question was expressly an offence, it is punishable under our law.\\"56. The court relied among other things on a rule which it formulated as follows: \\"The doing of an act which is expressly forbidden by the Legislature upon grounds of public policy constitutes an indictable offence, even though no penalty be attached.\\"55. The principle laid down in Forlee had been followed in the Appellate Division in R v Langley1931 CPD 31. and R v Baraitser,1931 CPD 418. but had been strongly criticised by De Wet and Swanepoel,Strafreg 4th ed at 46-47. and by Rabie and Strauss.Punishment: An Introduction to Principles 4th ed at 79-80. Ackermann J quoted Snyman to the following effect: > If the Legislature inadvertently omits the criminal norm, then the > Legislature itself should correct the error. It should not be left to the > court to speculate on what the Legislature wished to do and then be left to > the court itself to create a criminal norm. In any event the principle > quoted is formulated too broadly: ordinary legal norms can also be created > by means of express prohibitions, and can be based \\"upon grounds of public > policy\\", but this still does not transform such legal norms into criminal > norms.43.Translated by Snyman Casebook 24. In Ackermann J's opinion, \\"there is merit in this criticism.\\" For the purposes of this judgment, however, \\"I find it unnecessary to take this matter further for the following reason: even if one assumes that the principles laid down in Forlee are applicable in this Division, they are not applicable to the facts in the present case.\\" From the passage in Forlee quoted above, it appeared to Ackermann J that the consideration \\"that no law of this kind can be effective without a penalty\\" weighed heavily with the court. The position in the present case was completely different. The purpose of the regulation with which the court was here dealing was to maintain good order and discipline in the treatment centres concerned. There was no indication that this purpose could not be achieved in full by making use of the procedure set out in section 43(1) of the 1992 Act: that is, by the applicable centre's taking the necessary steps against the patient through an internal investigation, and imposing the punishment prescribed by regulation. Accordingly, Ackermann J could not see that the public interest required the transgression to be treated as an offence which could be tried and punished in the ordinary courts of the country. Apart from this, the legislature had expressly omitted from the 1992 Act those provisions of the 1971 Act which dealt with the prosecution and punishment in a magistrate's court of an inmate of a rehabilitation centre who transgresses. These considerations, taken cumulatively, led to the conclusion that the 1992 Act excluded the possibility of an inmate of a rehabilitation centre being criminally prosecuted in the ordinary courts of the country.See also, in general, S v La Grange 1991 (1) SACR 276 (C) at 278C-279. The relevant section in the 1992 Act contained only a legal norm, not a criminal one. As Snyman wrote subsequently, \\"In enacting the 1992 Act, the Legislature in all probability intended non-compliance with the legal norm to lead only to certain administrative measures being taken by the superintendent of the institute, and not to a criminal charge against and a conviction of the transgressor of the norm.\\"Casebook 25. The result of all this was that the accused Joseph Francis and Wally Singh should not have been charged or convicted in any magistrate's court of contravening Regulation 84(j). Accordingly, their convictions were set aside. Farlam J concurred in the judgment of Ackermann J.  Principle of legality  Snyman, much cited in Ackermann J's decision, subsequently noted of this decision that the court had \\"clearly recognised the importance of the principle of legality in criminal law.\\" Although the court did not expressly refuse to follow the principle enunciated in Forlee's case, it was \\"nevertheless significant,\\" thought Snyman, that the court was \\"quite sympathetic toward the criticism levelled at that case,\\"Casebook 25. including Snyman's own criticism.

Because he could not afford secondary education and later seminary schooling later, in 1927, he took the order of being a Missionary brother (and later friar) and he was sent to Gorna Grupna where the novitiate of the SVD was based and there he met fellow martyrs Aloysius Liguda and Stanis≈Çaw Kubista.

He also wrote the daily spiritual exercises that would be undertaken by his fellow aspiring novitiates, and even took care of the food preparations. In 1938, he was ordained as a friar (monk).

Facts  The accused was charged in a regional court with rape, in that, on a certain day in 2004, he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, then a nine-year-old girl. On the day the act was committed, the legislation creating a new statutory crime of rapeAct 32 of 2007. had not yet existed. The accused was charged with common-law rape. The evidence brought to light that the accused had not inserted his penis into the complainant's vagina, but into her anus. The state argued that the accused had to be convicted of the common-law crime of indecent assault, because, in terms of the rules of common law then applicable, such conduct did not qualify as rape, but only as indecent assault. At that time the common-law crime of rape could be committed only if an accused had sexually penetrated the complainant's vagina. In a surprising move, however, the regional court magistrate held that the common-law definition of rape was unconstitutional, inasmuch as sexual penetration of the complainant's anus was not punishable as rape, but only as indecent assault. The magistrate argued that indecent assault was a less serious crime than rape, and that a conviction of a less serious crime discriminated against the complainant, since there were no rational grounds upon which non-consensual penetration of a woman's anus, instead of her vagina, should be regarded, not as rape, but only as indecent assault. The magistrate also held that a magistrate's court has the power to consider the constitutionality of a rule of the common law and, if necessary, to change it. The magistrate accordingly convicted the accused of rape. The Criminal Law Amendment Act 105 of 1997 provides that the magistrate does not have the power to impose punishment in such a serious matter as the present. The case had to be referred to the High Court for the purpose of the imposition of punishment. This was done. The High court confirmed the decision of the magistrate's court, but the imposition of punishment was postponed until the Constitutional Court had confirmed the change in the definition of the common- law crime of rape.The judgment of the High Court has been reported as S v Masiya (Minister of Just√ºe and Constitutional Developomet Intervening) 2006 (2) SACR 357 (T). The Constitutional Court therefore had to decide whether the magistrate's court and the High Court had acted correctly in broadening the definition of the common-law crime of rape on the ground that the old definition had been unconstitutional.  Arguments  The High Court had emphasised the alleged inequality and discrimination engendered by the definition, and the resultant inadequate and discriminatory sentences. In oral argument, counsel for Mr Masiya argued against the development only if the developed definition of rape were to apply to him. The DPP and amici substantially supported the judgment of the High Court, arguing that the definition perpetuates gender inequality and promotes discrimination. The DPP further contended that the definition perpetuates leniency in sentencing. The Minister opposed the development. She relied on the decision of the Constitutional Court in S v Mhlungu to contend that the Regional Court should have decided the guilt or otherwise of Mr Masiya on the facts, and without considering the constitutional issue of developing the definition of rape. The amici, likewise, contended that, apart from the gendered nature of the origins of the definition, the elements of the crime of rape perpetuate gender stereotypes and discrimination because they are suggestive of the fact that only males can commit the crime, and only females can be raped. They argued that, once it is recognised that the primary motive for rape is not sexual lust, but the desire to gain power or control over another person, with sex being the violent means by which that power is exercised, the rationale for maintaining the gender distinction falls away.  Judgment  Nkabinde J determined that the primary questions to be considered were the following: * whether the current definition of rape was inconsistent with the Constitution, and whether the definition needed to be developed; * whether Mr Masiya was liable to be convicted in terms of the developed definition; * whether the declaration of invalidity of the relevant statutory provisions should be confirmed; * whether the merits of the criminal conviction should be dealt with by Constitutional Court; and * appropriate relief.  Constitutionality of the definition  Nkabinde J found it useful to examine the historical perspective of the criminalisation of rape, so as to determine its developmental direction. The word \\"rape\\" originates from the Latin words raptus, rapio and rapina, respectively meaning \\"tearing off, rending away, carrying off, abduction, rape, plundering;\\" \\"to seize, snatch, tear away, to plunder a place, to hurry along a person or thing;\\" and \\"robbery, pillage, booty plunder\\". As such, raptus in Roman law was generally understood as an offence consisting of the violent \\"carrying away\\" of women, and is better translated, in Nkabinde J's view, as \\"abduction. The crime of rape in Roman law, Nkabinde J found, was based on a prohibition of unchaste behaviour. Punishment for non-consensual sexual intercourse protected the interests of the society in penalising unchaste behaviour, rather than the interests of the survivor. In this period, patriarchal societies criminalised rape to protect the property rights of men over women. The patriarchal structure of families subjected women entirely to the guardianship of their husbands, and gave men a civil right not only over their spouses' property, but also over their spouses' persons. Roman-Dutch law placed force at the centre of the definition, with the concomitant requirement of \\"hue and cry\\" to indicate a woman's lack of consent. Submission to intercourse through fear, duress, fraud or deceit, as well as intercourse with an unconscious or mentally impaired woman, did not constitute rape but a lesser offence of stuprum. In English law the focus originally was on the use of force to overcome a woman's resistance. By the mid-eighteenth century, force was no longer required for the conduct to constitute rape. The scope of the definition was increased to include cases of fraud or deception. This latter definition was adopted in South Africa. In indigenous law, Nkabinde J wrote, rape was restrictively defined. Generally, the law stressed the responsibility of a group rather than of the individual. For instance, in Pedi law, in rape cases women must be assisted by their fathers or husbands. Compensation accrued not to the survivor but to her household, under the guardianship of the husband or the father. The law excluded cases of sodomy and marital rape. In some communities, intercourse with a prepubescent girl-child was also excluded from the definition. These acts often constituted merely assault or \\"unnatural sexuality.\\" It is evident to Nkabinde J, from the history of the law of rape, that the object of the criminalisation of rape was to protect the economic interests of the father, husband or guardian of the female survivor of rape, to perpetuate stereotypes, male dominance and power, and to refer to females as objects. With the advent of South Africa's constitutional dispensation, based on the democratic values of human dignity, equality and freedom, the social foundation of these rules had, in Nkabinde J's view, disappeared. Although she believed that the great majority of females, for the most part in rural South Africa, remained trapped in cultural patterns of sex-based hierarchy, there had been, she noted, a gradual movement towards recognition of a female as the survivor of rape, \\"rather than other antiquated interests or societal morals being at the core of the definition.\\" The focus was now on the breach of \\"a more specific right such as the right to bodily integrity\\" and security of the person, and the right to be protected from degradation and abuse. The crime of rape, wrote Nkabinde J, should therefore be seen in that context.  Current law  In South African law, as Nkabinde J was writing, rape was understood as the non- consensual penetration of a vagina by a penis. The generally accepted definition of rape, according to Heath J in S v Ncanywa,1992 (1) SACR 209 (Ck). was \\"the (a) intentional (b) unlawful (c) sexual intercourse with a woman (d) without her consent.\\" Heath J remarked that \\"the element of unlawfulness is based essentially on the absence of consent.\\" The four elements in the definition of rape were echoed by Van der Merwe J in S v Zuma, in which the absence of mens rea was relevant. The scholars Burchell and Milton stated that the definition of rape is \\"the intentional unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent.\\" Snyman preferred this definition: \\"Rape consists in a male having unlawful and intentional sexual intercourse with a female without her consent.\\" Nkabinde J noted that both shared an understanding of \\"sexual intercourse\\" as the \\"penetration of the woman's vagina by the male penis.\\" The definitions presupposed non-consensual sexual penetration of a vagina by a penis. Nkabinde J held that the definition of rape was not unconstitutional insofar as it criminalised conduct that was clearly morally and socially unacceptable. In this regard it was different from the common-law crime of sodomy, which had been declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court because it subjected people to criminal penalties for conduct which could not constitute a crime in the new constitutional order. Nkabinde J could find nothing in the current definition of rape to suggest that it was fatally flawed in a similar manner: > The current definition of rape criminalises unacceptable social conduct that > is in violation of constitutional rights. It ensures that the constitutional > right to be free \\"from all forms of violence, whether public or private, as > well as the right to dignity and equality are protected. Invalidating the > definition because it is under-inclusive is to throw the baby out with the > bath water. What is required then is for the definition to be extended > instead of being eliminated so as to promote the spirit, purport and objects > of the Bill of Rights. Moreover, continued Nkabinde J, the current law of rape has been affected by statutory developments in recent decades. In 1993, the rule that a husband could not rape his wife, the so-called marital rape exemption, was abolished; the presumption that a boy is incapable of committing rape was abolished in 1987. There had also been changes to the law of evidence relating to sexual offences. These changes, wrote the judge, reflected South African society's changing understanding of rape: > Due in no small part to the work of women's rights activists, there is wider > acceptance that rape is criminal because it affects the dignity and personal > integrity of women. The evolution of our understanding of rape has gone hand > in hand with women's agitation for the recognition of their legal personhood > and right to equal protection. To this end, women in South Africa and the > rest of the world have mobilised against the patriarchal assumption that > underlay the traditional definition of rape. They have focused attention on > the unique violence visited upon women. Much of this activism focused on > creating support systems for women, such as rape crisis centres and abuse > shelters; and also on the process whereby rape is investigated and > prosecuted. It is now widely accepted that sexual violence and rape not only > offend the privacy and dignity of women but also reflect the unequal power > relations between men and women in our society. The facts of the present matter, Nkabinde J determined, did not require the court to consider whether or not the definition of rape should be extended to include non-consensual penetration of the male anus by a penis. Arguments were presented to the court, which Nkabinde J considered to be strong, to the effect that gender specificity in relation to rape reflected patriarchal stereotypes inconsistent with the Constitution. This court had stressed previously, however, that it is not desirable that a case be dealt with on the basis of what the facts might be, rather than what they are. Nkabinde J conceded, though, that it could hardly be said that non-consensual anal penetration of males is less degrading, humiliating and traumatic, and (quoting a phrase of Brownmiller's) \\"a lesser violation of the personal private inner space, a lesser injury to mind, spirit and sense of self.\\" That this is so, the judge continued, does not mean that it is unconstitutional to have a definition of rape which is gender-specific. Focusing on anal penetration of females should not be seen, therefore, as disrespectful to male bodily integrity, or insensitive to the trauma suffered by male victims of anal violation, especially boys of the age of the complainant in casu: > Extending the definition to include non-consensual penetration of the anus > of the male by a penis may need to be done in a case where the facts require > such a development. It needs to be said that it is not constitutionally > impermissible to develop the common law of rape in this incremental way. > This Court has stated that in a constitutional democracy such as ours the > Legislature and not the Courts has the major responsibility for law reform > and the delicate balance between Courts' functions and powers on the one > hand and those of the Legislature on the other should be recognised and > respected. As Chaskalson P had written in Ferreira v Levin NO and Others; Vryenhoek and Others v Powell NO and Others, the terrains of the courts and the legislature should be kept separate, even though they may overlap. Nkabinde J had no doubt that the issue of male rape would be dealt with in an appropriate fashion either by the legislature or the courts \\"when the circumstances make it appropriate and necessary to do so.\\" The constitutional role of the courts in the development of the common law had to be distinguished from their other role: considering whether or not legislative provisions are consistent with the Constitution: > The latter role is one of checks and balances on the power provided for in > our Constitution, whereby courts are empowered to ensure that legislative > provisions are constitutionally compliant. The development of the common law > on the other hand is a power that has always vested in our Courts. It is > exercised in an incremental fashion as the facts of each case require. This incremental manner had not changed, wrote Nkabinde J, but the Constitution, in section 39(2), provided a paramount substantive consideration relevant to determining whether the common law required development in any particular case. This did not detract from the constitutional recognition that it is the Legislature which has the major responsibility for law reform: > Courts must be astute to avoid the appropriation of the Legislature's role > in law reform when developing the common law. The greater power given to the > Courts to test legislation against the Constitution should not encourage > them to adopt a method of common-law development which is closer to > codification than incremental, fact-driven development. Accordingly, Nkabinde J concluded that the definition of rape was not inconsistent with the Constitution, but needed to be adapted appropriately. The question remained, therefore: Did the facts of this particular case require that the definition be developed so as to include anal penetration of a female?  Common-law development  The question of the development of the common law was discussed (\\"comprehensively,\\" to Nkabinde J's mind) by Ackermann and Goldstone JJ in Carmichele v Minister of Safety & Security, in which was stressed the duty of the courts derived from sections 7, 8(1), 39(2) and 173 of the Constitution. The court sounded a reminder to judges, when developing the common law, to \\"be mindful of the fact that the major engine for law reform should be the Legislature and not the Judiciary.\\" The court also repeated with approval the remarks of Iacobucci J in R v Salituro: > Judges can and should adapt the common law to reflect the changing social, > moral and economic fabric of the country. Judges should not be quick to > perpetuate rules whose social foundation has long since disappeared. > Nonetheless there are significant constraints on the power of the Judiciary > to change the law [...]. In a constitutional democracy such as ours it is > the Legislature and not the courts which has the major responsibility for > law reform [...]. The Judiciary should confine itself to those incremental > changes which are necessary to keep the common law in step with the dynamic > and evolving fabric of our society. The court stated, however, that \\"courts must remain vigilant and should not hesitate to ensure that the common law is developed to reflect the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights [...] whether or not the parties in any particular case request the Court to develop the common law under s 39(2).\\" Where there is deviation from the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights, Nkabinde J added, courts are obliged to develop the common law by removing the deviation. Nkabinde J said that the Minister may have been right to contend that the Regional Court should have decided the guilt or otherwise of Mr Masiya on the facts, without considering the constitutional issue of developing the definition of rape: \\"That might well have been the proper way to deal with the matter. The failure to do so is, in the circumstances of this case, of no consequence.\\" When the matter was referred to the High Court in terms of section 52 of the Act, that court had had to determine whether the conviction was in accordance with justice before considering an appropriate sentence. The court called for further evidence and confirmed the conviction. Strictly speaking, wrote Nkabinde J, it was that finding (among others), not the finding by the regional court, against which leave to appeal was sought. Nkabinde J turned next to the contention of the amici that the elements of the crime of rape perpetuate gender stereotypes and discrimination, because they are suggestive of the fact that only males can commit the crime, and only females can be raped, and that, once it is recognised that the primary motive for rape is to gain power over another person, the rationale for maintaining the gender distinction falls away. \\"That,\\" she wrote, > might be so. However, for the reasons given above, it would not be > appropriate for this Court to engage with these questions. In this respect > there are three important considerations that favour restraint on the part > of this Court. The first is that what is at issue is extending the > definition of crime, something a Court should do only in exceptional > circumstances. The second is that the development would entail statutory > amendments and necessitate law reform. The third is that, historically, rape > has been and continues to be a crime of which females are its systematic > target. It is the most reprehensible form of sexual assault constituting as > it does a humiliating, degrading and brutal invasion of the dignity and the > person of the survivor. It is not simply an act of sexual gratification, but > one of physical domination. It is an extreme and flagrant form of > manifesting male supremacy over females. Nkabinde J cited the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which specifically enjoins member states to pursue policies to eliminate violence against women. Nonconsensual anal penetration of women and young girls is a form of violence against them equal in intensity and impact, Nkabinde J found, to that of non-consensual vaginal penetration: > The object of the criminalisation of this act is to protect the dignity, > sexual autonomy and privacy of women and young girls as being generally the > most vulnerable group in line with the values enshrined in the Bill of > Rights‚Äîa cornerstone of our democracy. Nkabinde J believed that the extended definition would protect the dignity of survivors, especially young girls who may not be able to differentiate between the different types of penetration. The evidence of Dr Grabe, an expert witness who testified in the High Court, that the complainant referred to a \\"hole\\" thinking that the anus is the only place she experiences as a \\"hole,\\" clearly illustrated this point. Women and girls would be afforded \\"increased protection,\\" wrote Nkabinde J, by the extended definition. She noted in addition that one of the social contexts of rape is the alarming high incidences of HIV-infection: \\"Anal penetration also results in the spread of HIV.\\" The consequences of non-consensual anal penetration might be different to those caused by non-consensual penetration of the vagina, > but the trauma associated with the former is just as humiliating, degrading > and physically hurtful as that associated with the latter. The inclusion of > penetration of the anus of a female by a penis in the definition will > increase the extent to which the traditionally vulnerable and disadvantaged > group will be protected by and benefit from the law. Adopting this approach > would therefore harmonise the common law with the spirit, purport and > objects of the Bill of Rights. One of the important considerations arising out of the question whether or not to develop the current definition related to the appropriate weight to be given to the 2003 Bill, which was a work in progress. \\"Essentially,\\" wrote Nkabinde J, \\"the question is whether the conviction of rape is in accordance with justice even though the definition of rape did not include non-consensual anal penetration at the time the crime was committed.\\" The High Court held that the principle of legality had no application in this case, since no new crime would be created if the definition were to be changed. It held that Mr Masiya knew that he was acting unlawfully when he assaulted the complainant, and that it had never been a requirement that an accused person should know, at the time of the commission of the crime, whether it is a common-law or statutory crime, or what its legal definition is. Mr Masiya contended that the extended definition should not apply to him, as the application would constitute a violation of his rights in terms of s 35(3)(l) of the Constitution. The ordinary principle of common law is that, when a rule is developed, it applies to all cases, not only those which arise after the judgment has been handed down. As Kentridge AJ observed in Du Plessis and Others v De Klerk and Another, > In our Courts a judgment which brings about a radical alteration in the > common law as previously understood proceeds upon the legal fiction that the > new rule has not been made by the Court but merely \\"found\\", as if it had > always been inherent in the law. Nor do our Courts distinguish between cases > which have arisen before, and those which arise after, the new rule has been > announced. For this reason it is sometimes said that \\"Judge- made law\\" is > retrospective in its operation. In all this our Courts have followed the > practice of the English Courts [.... I]t may nonetheless be said that there > is no rule of positive law which would forbid our Supreme Court from > departing from that practice. Indeed, as Kentridge AJ pointed out, members of the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords in the United Kingdom have accepted that it may be appropriate, when the interests of justice require it, for a new rule of law developed by the courts to operate prospectively only. B v Governor of Brockhill Prison, Ex parte Evans was a matter involving the unlawful detention of a prisoner. The governor had sentenced the prisoner on the basis of an interpretation of a statute which had originally been supported by the courts, but which had subsequently been held to be wrong. It was clear that the governor was blameless, but the sentence raised questions as to whether the new interpretation of the statute should apply prospectively only. The majority of the Law Lords held that, on the facts of that case, it was not appropriate for the interpretation to apply prospectively only, but all also accepted that the development of a rule might, in appropriate circumstances, apply prospectively. Lord Slynn of Hadley reasoned that \\"there may be decisions in which it would be desirable, and in no way unjust, that the effect of judicial rulings should be prospective or limited to certain claimants.\\" Under the South African constitutional order, noted Nkabinde J, the remedy of prospective overruling of a law that is inconsistent with the Constitution is permitted by the terms of section 172(1) (b) of the Constitution. In the present case she was not dealing with the court's remedial powers under section 172, as no order of constitutional invalidity had been made. The question was whether, when developing the common law, it was possible to do so prospectively only. In the view of Nkabinde J, it was: > In this case, if the definition of rape were to be developed retrospectively > it would offend the constitutional principle of legality as I have > demonstrated above. On the other hand, if we were to accept that the > principle of legality is a bar to the development of the common law, the > Courts could never develop the common law of crimes at all. In my view, such > a conclusion would undermine the principles of our Constitution which > require the courts to ensure that the common law is infused with the spirit, > purport and objects of the Constitution. The impasse can be avoided by > accepting that in these circumstances it is appropriate to develop the law > prospectively only. She accept that only in rare cases would it be appropriate to develop the common law with prospective effect only, as the Law Lords suggested in Brockhill Prison. In her opinion, however, this was one of those cases where fairness to the accused required that the development apply not to him, but only to those whose cases arose after judgment in the present matter had been handed down. Nkabinde J continued, \\"One of the central tenets underlying the common-law understanding of legality is that of foreseeability‚Äîthat the rules of criminal law are clear and precise so that an individual may easily behave in a manner that avoids committing crimes.\\" In this regard, the amici had referred to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in SW v United Kingdom, where the Court held as follows: > However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, > including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial > interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful > points and for adaptation to changing circumstances [...] provided that the > resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and > could reasonably be foreseen. The European Court used the element of foreseeability and article 17 of the Convention (intended to exclude the abuse of any specific rights safeguarded by the Convention for any of the purposes set out in the article) to find that the accused's conviction of the rape of his wife was not an infringement of the principle of legality as contained in article 7(1) of the Convention. In coming to its decision, the court emphasised the distinction between reinterpretation and clarification of the common law, on the one hand, and the creation, on the other, of a new common-law offence. It appeared to Nkabinde J that the court found the surprise element entailed by the retroactive application of the common law to be an unacceptable feature in that case. The European Commission of Human Rights, in CR v United Kingdom, had relied heavily on the submission that there was ambiguity as to whether the marital immunity of rape was law: > In the present case, the trial judge, when rejecting the applicant's > submission that marital immunity applied, doubted the extent to which it > could ever have been permissible under the common law for a husband to beat > his wife into having sexual intercourse with him [.... T]he Commission > considers that by November 1989 there was significant doubt as to the > validity of the alleged marital immunity for rape. As stated by the Court of > Appeal in the applicant's case, lip service had been paid to the alleged > general rule while the courts at the same time increased the number of > exceptions. That there was uncertainty as to the width of the exceptions is > apparent from the Law Commission Working Paper examining the question [....] > While there was no express authority for the proposition that an implied > agreement of separation between husband or wife or unilateral withdrawal of > consent by the wife would bring a case outside the marital immunity, the > Commission takes the view that in the present case where the applicant's > wife had withdrawn from cohabitation and there was de facto separation with > the expressed intention of both to seek a divorce, there was a basis on > which it could be anticipated that the courts could hold that the notional > consent of the wife was no longer to be implied [.... T]he Commission > considers that this adaptation in the application of the offence of rape was > reasonably foreseeable to an applicant with appropriate legal advice. Section 35(3)(l) of the Constitution, wrote Nkabinde J, confirmed a long- standing principle of the common law: Accused persons may not be convicted of offences where the conduct for which they are charged did not constitute an offence at the time it was committed. Although at first blush this provision might not seem to be implicated by finding Mr Masiya guilty of rape, \\"because the act he committed did constitute an offence both under national law and international law at the time he committed it, in my view, the jurisprudence of this Court would suggest otherwise.\\" Nkabinde J cited as authority the first case in which the Constitutional Court addressed section 35(3)(1) and its counterpart in respect of sentence, section 35(3)(n). In Veldman v Director of Public Prosecutions, Witwatersrand Local Division, the court held that the principle of legality is central to the rule of law under the Constitution. That case concerned the question of whether, where the sentencing jurisdiction of a court had been increased after an accused had pleaded, the accused could be sentenced in terms of the increased jurisdiction. The court held it could not, observing that, once an accused has pleaded, the constitutionally enshrined principle of legality requires that the sentencing jurisdiction of a court could not be varied to the detriment of the accused, even where it was clear that the increased sentence was a permissible sentence for the charge involved. The court held that \\"to retrospectively apply a new law, such as s 92(1) (a), during the course of the trial, and thereby to expose an accused person to a more severe sentence, undermines the rule of law and violates an accused person's right to a fair trial under s 35(3) of the Constitution.\\" The strong view of legality adopted in Veldman suggested to Nkabinde J that it would be unfair to convict Mr Masiya of an offence in circumstances where the conduct in question did not constitute the offence at the time of the commission: > I conclude so despite the fact that his conduct is a crime that evokes > exceptionally strong emotions from many quarters of society. However, a > development that is necessary to clarify the law should not be to the > detriment of the accused person concerned unless he was aware of the nature > of the criminality of his act. In this case, it can hardly be said that Mr > Masiya was indeed aware, foresaw or ought reasonably to have foreseen that > his act might constitute rape as the magistrate appears to suggest. The > parameters of the trial were known to all parties before the Court and the > trial was prosecuted, pleaded and defended on those bases. It follows > therefore that he cannot and should not bear adverse consequences of the > ambiguity created by the law as at the time of conviction. The evidence adduced at the trial established that Mr Masiya was guilty of indecent assault. To convict him of rape, held Nkabinde J, would be in violation of his right in section 35(3)(l) of the Constitution. She concluded therefore that the developed definition should not apply to Mr Masiya.  Declaration of invalidity  The next question to be considered was whether or not the declaration of invalidity, referred to the Constitutional Court in terms of section 172(2)(a), should be confirmed. In deciding whether to develop the definition of rape, noted Nkabinde J, the Court was obliged to confine itself to the facts of the case: \\"It follows therefore that the Court cannot confirm the declaration of invalidity to the extent that it is based on conclusions relating to the gender-neutral nature of the crime, an issue that does not arise on the facts of this case.\\" The relevant declaration of invalidity concerned statutory provisions in the Act and the Criminal Procedure Act, as well as their respective Schedules, to the extent that they were gender-specific. Having decided to extend the definition of rape to include anal penetration of both males and females, the High Court in consequence made an order reading the word \\"person\\" into the statutory provisions wherever reference is made to a specific gender. Nkabinde J concluded that the definition of rape should be extended so as to include anal penetration of a female, but that the question of non-consensual penetration of the penis into the anus of another male should be left open. That being so, there was no need for the court to address the declaration of invalidity of the statutory provisions made by the High Court. In conclusion, then, Nkabinde J declined to confirm the declarations of invalidity in paragraph 3 of the order.  Merits  Masiya had challenged the decision of the regional court mostly on various factual grounds, urging the Constitutional Court to consider the merits of the conviction. In effect, Masiya sought leave to appeal to the Constitutional Court on the merits of his conviction. Nkabinde decided this question as follows: > Even if it could be said that in this regard his application raises a > constitutional issue, which is unlikely given this Court's judgment in S v > Boesak, it is not in the interests of justice to grant him leave to appeal > directly to this Court on this issue. Mr Masiya has still not been sentenced > and once he has been, he will have the right to seek leave to appeal to the > appropriate court in the ordinary way. In that sense, his application for > leave to appeal on the merits is premature. Accordingly, the application for > leave to appeal on the merits of his conviction should be refused.  Magistrates' power to develop common law in respect of crimes  \\"I must dispose of one further matter,\\" wrote Nkabinde J, \\"before I deal with the relief. That relates to the question whether the magistrates' courts have the power to develop the common law.\\" She found it necessary to consider whether magistrates' courts had the power to develop the common law to bring it in line with the Constitution. The High Court had held that the magistrate's court was not explicitly excluded from pronouncing upon the constitutional validity of crimes at common law. It was necessary to consider the constitutional jurisdiction of these courts, since the Constitutional Court had not considered this question before: > Although magistrates' courts are at the heart of the application of the > common law on a daily basis and, in most instances, courts of first instance > in criminal cases, there are legitimate reasons why they are not included > under s 173 and why their powers are attenuated. Magistrates are constrained > in their ability to develop crimes at common law by virtue of the doctrine > of precedent. Their pronouncements on the validity of common-law criminal > principles would create a fragmented and possibly incoherent legal order. An > effective operation of the development of common-law criminal principles > depends on the maintenance of a unified and coherent legal system, a system > maintained through the recognised doctrine of stare decisis which is aimed > at avoiding uncertainty and confusion, protecting vested rights and > legitimate expectations of individuals, and upholding the dignity of the > judicial system. Moreover, and contrary to the view held by the magistrate > in his judgment, there does not seem to be any constitutional or legislative > mandate for all cases in which a magistrate might see fit to develop the > common law in line with the Constitution to be referred to higher courts for > confirmation. Such a referral might mitigate the disadvantageous factors > discussed above. The suggestion by the High Court that magistrates are empowered to vary the elements of crimes in the light of the Constitution was therefore, in the opinion of Nkabinde J, incorrect.  Relief  Section 172(1)(b) of the Constitution conferred a discretion on the Constitutional Court to make any order that is just and equitable. Having found that the common-law definition of rape was not constitutionally invalid, but merely falls short of the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights, the declaration of invalidity of the definition of rape was therefore set aside, to be replaced with an appropriate order. Having found that the developed definition of rape could not apply to Mr Masiya, it could not be said, on the facts before the court, that his conviction was in accordance with justice: \\"The conviction of rape should, on the facts, be replaced with a conviction of indecent assault.\\" The order of the High Court therefore could not stand, so the appeal against the conviction of rape was upheld. Having substituted the conviction of rape with that of indecent assault, Nkabinde J found it necessary to remit the matter to the regional court to impose appropriate punishment: > It needs be said that the offence of indecent assault is egregious. Mr > Masiya assaulted a nine-year-old child. The offence arouses public > indignation. The regional court is obliged, when considering an appropriate > punishment, to apply its mind to the nature and gravity of the offence of > which Mr Masiya has been convicted and not merely look at the legal > definition thereof. The fact that he has been convicted of indecent assault > does not automatically mean that the sentence to be imposed upon him should > be more lenient than if he had been convicted of rape.  Order  After thanking counsel for their assistance, Nkabinde J made the following order: # \\"The application for leave to appeal against the declarations of invalidity and the order and judgment of the High Court confirming the conviction of Mr Masiya of rape is granted. # \\"The application for leave to appeal against the conviction on the merits is dismissed. # \\"The order of the High Court is set aside in its entirety. # \\"The order of the regional court referring the criminal proceedings to the High Court for purposes of sentence in terms of s 52(1)(b)(i) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 105 of 1997, is set aside. # \\"The common-law definition of rape is extended to include acts of non-consensual penetration of a penis into the anus of a female. # \\"The development of the common law referred to in para 5 above shall be applicable only to conduct which takes place after the date of judgment in this matter. # \\"The conviction of Mr Masiya by the regional court of rape is set aside and replaced with a conviction of indecent assault. # \\"The case is remitted to the regional court for Mr Masiya to be sentenced in the light of this judgment.\\" Moseneke DCJ, Kondile J; Madala J, Mokgoro J, O'Regan J, Van der Westhuizen J, Yacoob J and Van Heerden AJ concurred with the judgment of Nkabinde J.  Langa CJ  Langa CJ, with whom Sachs J concurred, wrote a separate short judgment in which he agreed with the judgment of Nkabinde J, but went even further. According to him, the new, broader definition of common-law rape must be so wide as to include nonconsensual sexual penetration of the anus of either a female or a male. In her majority judgment, Nkabinde J held that only non-consensual sexual penetration of a woman through her anus should be included in the definition.  Criticism  The judgment was controversial and much criticised. \\"It amounts,\\" wrote the academic CR Snyman, > to a disturbing undermining of the principle of legality in criminal law. > The Constitutional Court has arrogated to itself the power to change the > definitions of crimes, and more particularly of broadening the ambit of the > field of application of a crime.Casebook 39-40. He argued that it was wrong to say that the definition of common-law rape was irrational and discriminatory: > The difference between sexual penetration by a man of a woman through her > vagina (which, according to the common law, is rape) and such penetration > through her anus (which, according to the common law, is not rape but > indecent assault) in fact rests on a completely rational basis, namely the > following: First, there is an anatomical difference between men and a women. > Below the waist men have only one orifice that can be sexually penetrated, > namely the anus. Women, on the other hand, have two such orifices, namely > the anus as well as the vagina. To regard this difference as amounting to > discrimination or inequality is incorrect. It amounts to \\"putting God in the > dock\\" because He (or She, or evolution, or whoever or whatever one believes > to have created the world and mankind), by creating two different types of > people (men and women), failed to obey the currently \\"politically correct\\" > principle that there ought to be no differences between people. Second, the > function of a woman's vagina and that of her anus are fundamentally > different: the way in which the human species procreates is by the male > discharging his semen into the woman's vagina, as opposed to her anus. > Penile penetration of the vagina may result in the woman becoming pregnant. > The danger of pregnancy is absent if the woman is penetrated anally, even if > there had been an emission of semen. This results in a woman's vagina > playing a privileged role in her biological makeup. A woman's vagina and her > anus are not simply two species of the same genus. One of the most important > reasons for the existence of the crime of rape is the danger of the woman > becoming pregnant against her will. Non-consensual penile penetration of the > vagina violates the most personal of all the parts of a woman's body. It > infringes her whole being and identity as a woman, as opposed to a man. > Accordingly vaginal and anal penetration deserve to be treated separately. > This is precisely what the common law did.Casebook 40-41. For Snyman, the most important criticism to make against the judgment > is that it creates a disturbing precedent. The court works with the > following principle: if the court is of the opinion that conduct which at > present does not fall within the definition ought to fall thereunder because > it is analogous to conduct falling thereunder, that both types of conduct > (that which falls thereunder and that which does not fall thereunder) relate > to the same right or rights protected in the Bill of Rights, and that both > types of conduct deserve the same punishment, then a court is free to extend > the definition of the crime by holding that the conduct which formerly did > not form part of the definition should now indeed form part of the > definition. If one applies this principle, there are many crimes of which > the definitions are now no longer certain. Thus the definition of > housebreaking may be extended to include acts whereby a person breaks into a > motor car (conduct which presently does not qualify as housebreaking because > a motor car is a movable thing); the definition of arson may be extended to > include cases in which one sets fire to a movable object such as a motor car > or a railway truck (conduct which presently does not qualify as arson); and > the definition of such a well-known crime as theft may now be extended to > include cases in which one appropriates non-corporeal things, such as a > tune, an idea, an architectural plan, or a plot of a story.41-42. Section 39(2) of the Constitution, on which the court relied, could not be used, in Snyman's view, as an argument to circumvent the clear provisions of subsections 35(3)(l) and (n), which prohibited the creation of new crimes or the extension of the scope of existing ones. Section 35 formed part of the Bill of Rights; section 39 dealt with the interpretation of the Bill of Rights. According to Snyman, > The court wrongly uses what it calls \\"the incremental development of the > common law\\" as a vehicle to evade the clear provisions of section 35 of the > Bill of Rights. Section 39(2) may be used to remove uncertainties or > ambiguities in the present definitions of crimes or to hold that certain > forms of conduct do not fall within the definition of a crime. Apart from > this, the \\"promotion of the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of > Rights\\" [...] is more applicable to the field of civil law than to the field > of criminal law.42Snyman endorsed in this regard \\"the apt remarks\\" of > Froneman J in S v Mshumpa 2008 1 SACR 126 (E) para 55.See also Snyman 2008 > SALJ 677ff: \\"Extending the Scope of Rape‚Äîa Dangerous Precedent.\\"  See also  * Rape * South African criminal law  References   Books  * Snyman, CR.

GH model) is a three state two dimensional cellular automaton (abbrev CA) named after James M. Greenberg and Stuart Hastings, designed to model excitable media, One advantage of a CA model is ease of computation. The model can be understood quite well using simple \\"hand\\" calculations, not involving a computer. Another advantage is that, at least in this case, one can prove a theorem characterizing those initial conditions which lead to repetitive behavior. Informal description As in a typical two dimensional cellular automaton, consider a rectangular grid, or checkerboard pattern, of \\"cells\\". It can be finite or infinite in extent. Each cell has a set of \\"neighbors\\". In the simplest case, each cell has four neighbors, those being the cells directly above or below or to the left or right of the given cell. Like this: the b's are all of the neighbors of the a. The a is one of the neighbors of each of the b's. b b a b b At each \\"time\\" t=0,1,2,3,...., each cell is assigned one of three \\"states\\", typically called \\"resting\\" (or \\"quiescent\\" ; see excitable medium), \\"excited\\", or \\"refractory\\". The assignment of states for all cells is arbitrary for t = 0, and then at subsequent times the state of each cell is determined by the following rules. 1\\\\. If a cell is in the excited state at time t then it is in the refractory state at time t+1. 2\\\\. If a cell is in the refractory state at time t then it is in the resting state at time t+1. 3\\\\. If a given cell is in the resting state at time t and at least one of its neighbors is in the excited state at time t, then the given cell is in the excited state at time t+1, otherwise (no neighbor is excited at time t) it remains in the resting state at time t+1. In this way the whole grid of cells advances from their initial states at t = 0 to their states at t = 1, then to their states at t = 2,3,4, etc., producing a pattern of cells in the various states for each time. See the first animation in Belousov‚ÄìZhabotinsky reaction for a striking example of behavior that can be exhibited by this model. The three states are indicated by different colors. Mathematical description  To describe the GH model more mathematically, consider the simplest case of a grid of square cells C_{i,j} . At each time t = 0,1,2,... the cell C_{i,j} has a state S_{i,j}^t \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1,2\\\\\\\\}. The type of neighborhood is not important, so long as each cell has some neighbors. In a square grid (as opposed to hexagonal), either four or eight cell neighborhoods work fine. The evolution rule is as follows: If S_{i,j}^t=1 then S_{i,j}^{t+1} =2 . If S_{i,j}^t=2 then S_{i,j}^{t+1}=0. If S_{i,j}^t =0 and S_{i',j'}^t=1 for some neighboring cell C_{i',j'}, then S_{i,j}^{t+1}=1 . Otherwise, S_{i,j}^{t+1}=0. Relation to a model of Wiener and Rosenblueth While the GH model has often been compared with the ground breaking model of Wiener and Rosenblueth developed earlier for the same purpose, the analogy is incorrect because the latter is not a CA. See for example, in which it is stated that \\"The organization of muscle cells, the contraction of muscle, the dependence of the activity of the medium on the activity of its component elements, problems of memory, reliability, and mobility were formulated by Wiener in the form of definitions and theorems for a three-phase threshold-invariant continuous excitable medium.\\" Even this statement is misleading, however. By reading the original paper carefully, it can be seen that neither the time, the medium, nor the state are discrete. This is immediately obvious as regards the time and the medium. Wiener and Rosenblueth do say, though, that \\"There are three conditions in which any given region of the fiber can exist.\\" They name these as the \\"active\\", the \\"refractory\\", and the \\"rest\\" states. However, in the next paragraph they refine this by identifying the rest state with the number 1, the active state with the number 0, and the refractory state with the open interval (0,1) on the real line. The number assigned to a give point at a given time is called its \\"epoch number\\" at that time. Thus, the \\"state space\\" is the interval [0,1]. And in the next paragraph we find \\"..behind every wave front moving freely there will be a band of fixed width within which the recovery process is taking place.\\" A wave therefore consists of a \\"front\\", a smooth curve of points with epoch number 0 which moves in the plane with constant speed, followed by a refractory region of points with epoch number in (0,1), of constant width (depending on the velocity), and leaving behind a rest region of points with epoch number 1. This is far from a cellular automata, and is more correctly called a \\"geometric\\" model. Further on in it is stated that \\"Automaton models of excitable media were investigated in [9] and [10]. These models are a discrete analog of Wiener's medium.\\" (The models in their citations \\"[9]\\" and \\"[10]\\" are different from GH.) Many writers have called the Weiner‚ÄìRosenblueth model a cellular automaton. The earliest paper found by Google Scholar with this designation clearly stated is. However, as mentioned above, the continuity of the Wiener-Rosenblueth medium has not so far allowed as precise a theorem about persistence of patterns as the one for GH which is described below. On the other hand, several theorems are stated in which are similar to those proved in, though the proofs given for the theorems in are less clear than those in because of the natures of the respective models. See also for an often cited computer study based on a model which is similar to that of Wiener and Rosenblueth. Generating a spiral One interesting behavior is seen, for a four cell neighborhood and a square grid, when the initial condition consists of a half line of excited cells (1's) going off to infinity and below this half line a half line of refractory cells (2's). The rest of the cells are resting when t=0. Like this: ................................................................... ....00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.... ....00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.... ....00000000000000000001111111111111111111111111111111111111111.... ....00000000000000000002222222222222222222222222222222222222222.... ....00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.... ....00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.... ................................................................... The spiral which is produced can be seen in. This spiral can easily be seen by following the pattern forward for a few iterations \\"by hand\\". No computer is necessary. A theorem As stated in, and proved in (which also considered n-state models), if the set of initial 1's is finite, then every individual cell oscillates forever through the cycle 0,1,2,0 if and only if at the start there is at least one square of four neighboring cells with one of the following patterns: 1 2 2 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 2 2 or some reflection or rotation of one of these. These patterns cannot be killed off by their surroundings. It is the \\"only if\\" part of this result which is most interesting. If none of these patterns is present at t = 0, then in any bounded region the pattern eventually settles down to all zeros. The key tool in the proof in is a \\"winding number\\" which is shown to be invariant for this model. One easy consequence of the theorem stated above is that if there are no \\"refractory\\" cells initially then the pattern will die out in any bounded region (whether the total grid is finite or infinite in extent). This property of an excitable medium was found earlier, in the paper of Wiener and Rosenblueth, and does not hold if there are \\"holes\\" in the region.  Notes   References  * R. Fisch, J.

At this location, 40-50 graduate students are employed at the Wayne State University main campus. The students are pursuing master of fine arts degrees in acting, directing, theatre management, costuming or design management. Created in 1963, the Hilberry Theatre is the oldest graduate repertory company in the United States. The Hilberry Theatre puts on roughly six different plays, both modern and classic, from October through May each year. History In February 1917, the First Church of Christ Scientist was built on the corner of Cass Avenue and Hancock Street, in the heart of Midtown Detroit. The Christian Scientists of Detroit were a growing community in need of a location to hold their services. The building held up to 1,512 members and included a 60-foot stage and 22 rooms. Later on in 1961, it was purchased and remodeled by Wayne State University. Wayne State purchased the building now housing the Hilberry Theatre for $250,000, which included a $25,000 down payment. The building was officially owned by the university on June 15, 1961. After many renovations, the building was renamed the Hilberry Theatre, after Wayne State's fourth president, Clarence B. Hilberry, and reopened in January 1964. There is now a bronze bust (sculpture) of Clarence Hilberry in the main lobby of the theatre in honor of his accomplishments. The first play performed at the Hilberry Theatre was called Shakespeare 400, in honor of the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare's birth. Today, the Hilberry Theatre is one of three different historic buildings now used for classes by Wayne State students. The Hilberry is also considered to be one of the best training grounds for new and upcoming actors/actresses and directors in the area. Architecture The Hilberry Theatre was originally constructed in 1916-17 by the architectural firm Field, Hinchman & Smith as the First Church of Christ Scientist. Designed in a Neoclassical architecture and Ionic style, the Hilberry is a low rise building with an estimated height of 41.55 feet and consists of two floors, as well as a basement. The Hilberry has an Ionic style colonnade on the exterior of the building facing Hancock Street and its masonry is made to resemble that of marble. The exterior door frames are surrounded in classical moldings and the facade facing Cass Avenue is designed in similar manner and serves as the main entrance to the theatre. On June 16, 1961, Wayne State University purchased the church building and remodeled its 60-foot stage and 1,512 seated auditorium into a 532 seated theater. The open stage theatre was designed using a Roman and Elizabethan approach. A traditional stage with backdrop and doors, a center performance stage, and elevated area surrounding the seating area. The theatre opened in 1964 to house a graduate repertory company. Hilberry Theatre uses General public * Viewing of graduate student performances of classical pieces. ($10‚Äì32) * Opportunities to do volunteer work as an usher. * Group hostings‚Äô (church group, student organization, tour groups, etc.) for events and discounts on ticket prices, a private room, and a preview performance for group leaders. * Can purchase play packages offering benefits such as choice seating, discounted tickets, ticket upgrades, and dining discounts. Theatre students Graduate theatre students pursuing a degree in acting, management, and design become part of a three-year program in which they receive training from a professional staff providing the tools to receive their graduate degrees. Each year the graduate students are involved in more than one hundred performances in front of a public audience. Graduate students of the Hilberry company receive assistantships such as tuition waivers, medical insurance and a stipend. Graduate programs The Hilberry Theatre graduate training program is a three-year program offering specializations in the following areas: Acting, Scenic Design, Costume Design, Lighting Design, Stage Management and Theatre Management. Acting The Hilberry acting program stresses the performance aspect of the acting process, holding that performing in front of a live audience is the supreme way of learning the art of acting. Its foundations are laid on a series of European and American classics, combined with some contemporary plays. Costume Design The Hilbery Costume Design program presents the opportunity to practice costume design in a manner which stresses the practical nature of theatrical design. Through accelerated hands on classroom, studio and design production experience, costume design majors are able to grasp the knowledge needed to design for multiple productions held at the Hilberry Theatre, as well as the undergraduate Bonstelle Theatre. Lighting Design The Hilberry lighting design program is aimed toward theatre production and individual projects. This provides students the freedom to choose more individualized coursework, pushing them to develop into distinctive artists. Scenic Design The Hilberry Scenic Design program is centered on practical training and design experience to help students develop production related skills. Through collaboration, conceptualization, originality and self-discovery, students are able to work in wide ranges of styles, allowing them to enter in a broad world of professional entertainment. This program is a pre-professional terminal degree. Stage Management The Hilberry Stage Management program requires dedication and passion for the process of theatre production. It also demands creative mindsets that are able to conduct successful productions. This program focuses on preparing students for advanced positions in education and theatre. Students will commit to at least six professional productions at the Hilberry and will mentor undergraduate students at the Bonstelle Theatre. Theatre Management The Hilberry Theatre Management program is primarily focused on promoting arts leadership, similar to what is studied in the arts administration programs. Students learn leadership training skills, through hands on experience, to eventually acquire the ability to run a professional theatre.

He was an Associate Professor at the School of Architecture and Urban Planning of Princeton University until 1970 and, with his twin brother Aladar, a pioneer in the field of Bioclimatic design in the 1950's and 60's. Background Their first article was \\"The Temperate House\\" (1951), followed by other works on \\"Bioclimatic Approach to Architecture\\" and \\"To Pave to Bio-climatical Control and Orientation to Meet Requirements\\" (1954). More articles arose like \\"Sun orientation\\" and finally,\\"Environment and building shape\\" (1954). As of that moment the Olgyays became a huge reference to various new kind of architecture like solar Architecture, passive Architecture, bio-climatice Architecture. The energy crisis of the 1970's caused a significant economic damage to the developed world and greatly increased interest in the Olgyay brothers work. Victor Olgyay died in 1970. Architecture and climate This is a book where Victor Olgyay writes about the relationship between buildings and nature surrounds it. The book is separated into three parts concerning the climate and their relationship to human being, the interpretation of the effect on climate architectonic key and to its application in Architecture and Urbanism. Altogether \\"Architecture and Climate\\", develops into one complete theory of the architectonic design, supported by logical and theoretical justifications with coherent explanation of physical principles. Olgyay also relates methods and knowledge of other disciplines like Biology, Meteorology and Climatology, Engineering and Physics. These basic principles are applicable to any present project or recycling of an old building to help them adapt to its site and thus help reduce the environmental impact that it generates. Content of architecture and climate The book is divided in three parts: Climatic Interpretation, Interpretation according to architectonic principles and Application. Part 1: The \\"Climatic Interpretation\\" is a general introduction to a bio-climatic interpretation of climatic Elements. This first part is of great importance since it proposes his famous bio-climatic graph that is still in use today as a tool used by various bio-climatic architects world wide. Part 2: The \\"Interpretation According to Architectonic Principles\\" goes on from Chapter 5 to 10 focuses on various Architectonic Principles. These consists of the election of location, the solar control, the wind drifts, models of air flow and the thermal effects of the materials. Part 3: The \\"Application\\" focus mainly on the application of architectonic principles on four regions, the temperate zone, the cold zone, the warm-barren zone and the warm humid zone.

They were introduced by Irving Kaplansky in 1951. As operator algebras, von Neumann algebras, among all C*-algebras, are typically handled using one of two means: they are the dual space of some Banach space, and they are determined to a large extent by their projections. The idea behind AW*-algebras is to forgo the former, topological, condition, and use only the latter, algebraic, condition.  Definition  Recall that a projection of a C*-algebra is a self-adjoint idempotent element. A C*-algebra A is an AW*-algebra if for every subset S of A, the left annihilator :\\\\mathrm{Ann}_L(S)=\\\\\\\\{a\\\\in A\\\\mid \\\\forall s\\\\in S, as=0 \\\\\\\\}\\\\, is generated as a left ideal by some projection p of A, and similarly the right annihilator is generated as a right ideal by some projection q: :\\\\forall S \\\\subseteq A\\\\, \\\\exists p,q \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Proj}(A) \\\\colon \\\\mathrm{Ann}_L(S)=Ap, \\\\quad \\\\mathrm{Ann}_R(S)=qA. Hence an AW*-algebra is a C*-algebras that is at the same time a Baer *-ring. The original definition of Kaplansky states that an AW*-algebra is a C*-algebra such that (1) any set of orthogonal projections has a least upper bound, and (2) that each maximal commutative C*-subalgebra is generated by its projections. The first condition states that the projections have an interesting structure, while the second condition ensures that there are enough projections for it to be interesting. Note that the second condition is equivalent to the condition that each maximal commutative C*-subalgebra is monotone complete.  Structure theory  Many results concerning von Neumann algebras carry over to AW*-algebras. For example, AW*-algebras can be classified according to the behavior of their projections, and decompose into types. For another example, normal matrices with entries in an AW*-algebra can always be diagonalized. AW*-algebras also always have polar decomposition. However, there are also ways in which AW*-algebras behave differently from von Neumann algebras. For example, AW*-algebras of type I can exhibit pathological properties, even though Kaplansky already showed that such algebras with trivial center are automatically von Neumann algebras.  The commutative case  A commutative C*-algebra is an AW*-algebra if and only if its spectrum is a Stonean space. Via Stone duality, commutative AW*-algebras therefore correspond to complete Boolean algebras. The projections of a commutative AW*-algebra form a complete Boolean algebra, and conversely, any complete Boolean algebra is isomorphic to the projections of some commutative AW*-algebra.

The initial song was named \\"The Sure Shot Dope Tracks Pt 1\\". The early 1990s Blak Prophetz' first known track was called \\"Fax on Wax\\" which was released by the London record label Kickin Records, now considered rare and has fetched up to ¬£30 in auctions. During the song's verses, Sure Shot made references to early rap groups like the Sugarhill Gang and Cold Crush Brothers. It achieved a number 9 in the UK Echo's Jazz Charts which was compiled by Steve Chandler in the 18 May edition of Echoes magazine in 1991. John Mayor, a contributing writer for Mixmag, described the song as a \\"cool jazz attack for Ladbroke Grove's pavement posse.\\" John Slater, a reviewer for Hip Hop Connection magazine researched Sure Shot's past and during the review he touched on how his parents travelled from Jamaica in the '50s and how his father, who was a DJ, inspired his love for making music. Slater also went on to describe how Sure Shot was regularly tasked with \\"humping massive sound systems around\\" with his father. These would have been large speakers often carried around when his father was doing a show or was involved in a possible sound clash. He eventually left Kickin Records to sign a new record deal with London's new hip hop record label Kold Sweat Records based in Ladbroke Grove. Kold Sweat was run by Tony Powell who was also the Managing director of Pinnacle Entertainment and was home to some of the UK's prime hip hop acts of that era including the Son of Noise. Their new single titled \\"Chapter One\\" was recorded in 1992 and shortly after this release, Sure Shot decided to relocate to London to pursue his musical career. Kenny Grogan, another writer for Mixmag, featured the new song in the April edition awarding the song a 4 out of 5 rating. With an ending remark \\"mooody\\", Grogan expressed his acknowledgement of the decreasing hip hop vinyl saying \\"homegrown hip hop is hard to find\\". He praised the existence of the song and went on to say: \\"It should help the rest of the world of decreasing hip hop vinyl\\". The mid-1990s Whilst Sure Shot was working on new material, Kold Sweat decided to close their doors for business for good but this did not stop him from pursuing his career. In 1998, he decided to release a new single via his own production outfit called 'Fatt Jointz' or 'FJ Entertainment' called \\"Money & Guns\\" which caught the attention of well known DJs including Tim Westwood of BBC Radio 1. Westwood included the single in his favorite 'Top 10 Flava's Singles', describing the Prophetz as \\"old skool survivors\\" and praised Sure Shot's reshuffle of the band and previous relocation to London. A new article by a reporter called Tee Max from Echoes magazine focused on Sure Shot's new life in London, his settling into the London life and becoming a father for the first time. \\"Money and Gunz\\" grew popular in his hometown back in the Midlands as Max would continuously make reference to the fact that it was a favourite on Birmingham's Choice FM DJ One Step Ahead show. Sure Shot's extensive record collection would often pop up during the discussion as his huge vinyl stack was the backdrop of the interview photo but he was secretive about which samples he used. In November that same year, a writer named Mike Lewis of Hip Hop Connection drew on a more serious issue which was affecting British hip hop acts throughout the UK during that period. Lewis knew that many UK acts were finding it almost impossible to gain recognition overseas and that UK hip hop was somewhat struggling for exposure. It was a touchy subject that was not usually openly discussed in the media by UK rap artists but during the interview the Prophetz were not afraid to speak openly about this issue. Collaborations During 2003, Blak Prophetz was somewhat put on hold for a short period so that Sure Shot could complete other projects with other musicians like the remix project for Kwame Kwaten of D-Influence and Warren Stacey who was managed by Kwaten at that time. He requested Sure Shot's production skills on a duet track called \\"Hot for You\\" which featured Stacey and was released on Brownsugar Records, distributed by Avex Group, Japan. It was called \\"The WS Project\\" located on an album called Soul Essentials Vol. 6, released by Avex. The mid-2000s Blak Prophetz were back releasing a 12-inch called \\"With FX\\", from their coming album that year entitled 2nd Coming. It was released in New York and distributed through TRC Distribution, in Los Angeles on vinyl and was a feature in the Blues & Soul magazine by writer Ryan Proctor during October 2005. During that same period came the cross-collaboration release of the 2nd Coming album which included other rap artists. The album attracted some negative critical attention from Tadah of UrbanSmarts.com magazine who declared: > \\"As we start with talking about the lyrics, let's end with talking about the > lyrics. The potential of what the Blak Prophetz really can do appears on > \\"Still a Kid.\\" This struggle-and-strives tale was done shockingly real and > is a hundred times better than the tried and tired battle rhymes on here. > Even though the level of the braggadocio only reflects the down earth rap > music this is. This is nothing fancy or flashy, but some gritty, grassroots > type traditional rap music. Good as such, but in no way spectacular.\\" Despite lacking positive critical attention from Tadah, the track from the album titled \\"What Is Rap\\" was selected by Bartle Bogle Hegarty whose client Mentos chose to use for the global Mentos Fruity 3 High Rider advert campaign. It also caught the attention of Notion Magazine also known as Notionmag. Notions writer, Loriann Luckings conducted an insight into the band's progression focusing on how they had travelled and pushed their way through the ranks saying; > ‚ÄúThe lads went to the big smoke in 1996 to distribute, sell and promote > themselves and their music. They soon got signed to record label Kold Sweat > Records and formed as the Blak Prophetz. Sure Shot is regarded highly for > his remixing and production skills, having worked with artists including the > likes of Justin Timberlake and Jason Jermaine. He is what is known commonly > as the background guy ‚Äì the one who does a lot of the hard work and takes > very little commercial credit.\\" Critical reception During an interview in the 1 August 1991 edition of Hip Hop Connection, Slater asked Blak Prophetz what they thought of the new emerging success of the US rap group Public Enemy. A response came from a temporary member at that time namely Willie B who responded stating that \\"Public Enemy stayed where the money was\\" (meaning that PE remained attached to a record label that was run by a white management). Willie applauded Professor Griff's move to Luke Records, which was run by a team of black individuals. The statement outraged Chuck D, the main member of PE, who later responded directly Willie in issue 34 stressing that there was no black system and that 'Griff' still has to deal with a white ran system. 2009-2012 Sure Shot managed to earn a publishing deal with 2 Entertain which is now controlled by the BBC and Demon Music Group. Since the album, there have been other releases, including \\"What Is Rap\\" which was used in the Global TV commercial for Mentos Fruity 3 Gum. Whilst working on the Blak Prophetz next album, he has also been involved other productions for Joyce Sims under the name of 'The Soul Garden (Funk Division)' (his personal jazz/funk production band). \\" Mark Duffus, Producer He is also an A&R; Consultant for Tune Tribe's new London music consultancy company, Arising Artists. 2013‚Äìpresent A politically themed song called \\"What the F## Pt. 1\\" was released towards the end of 2013. During that same period, the song became popular and the author and founder of Hip Hop Foundation magazine, Karl Smith, reviewed and praised the song describing it as \\"slamming\\", stating: \\"It touches on issues amongst today‚Äôs youth.\\" Sure Shot & Chris Brown - BET Awards, Los Angeles Sure Shot, Ne-Yo & Dawn Penn on the red carpet at the BET Awards 2013, Los Angeles.

Radio career Abrantee Boateng, also known professionally as DJ Abrantee, started his radio career in 2005 working the night shift at Choice FM and filling in for absentees whilst continuing his work as a DJ on the club circuit. The following year, Boateng was asked to present Saturday's Choice, a show that aired once a month on a Saturday. In 2007, the success of Saturday's Choice led to a permanent position at Choice FM to host the new Morning Riser show between 3:00 am and 6:00 am from Monday to Friday. He then moved to another time slot in March 2010 to present the station's weekday evening show from 8:00 pm to 12:00 am.

This led to DJ Abrantee being included in two broad sheet pieces on Afrobeats, the first one in the Guardian in January 2012 and the second one in the London Evening Standard in February 2012. Both articles highlighted his role in the resurgence of the music genre in the United Kingdom.

It is a story of a little adivasi boy's obsession with becoming Rama, set against the backdrop of corrupt land mining activities threatening to destroy his village and the civil strife it leads to. The film stars Nandita Das, Seema Biswas, Salim Kumar and Raju Singh (as Oonga). Oonga had its world premiere at the New York Indian Film Festival on 3 May 2013; and was screened in the 'India Gold' section at the 15th Mumbai Film Festival; the 13th River to River Florence Indian film festival 2013 and the Indian film festival at Melbourne 2014. Oonga is also a part of the international competition at the International Film Festival of Kerala 2014.  Plot  Little adivasi Oonga misses his village school trip to see the ‚ÄòRamayana‚Äô. Upset about being the only kid in his tribal village Pottacheru who has not yet seen the mythical warrior-king ‚ÄòRama‚Äô, Oonga runs away, embarking on a long adventurous journey to the big city of Lohabad. Oonga braves his way across forests, rivers and roads, hitching stolen rides on cars past valleys dug up for industrialization... along under-construction highways... until he reaches Lohabad. This world is much larger, brighter and faster than where he came from. After being denied entry he sneaks in to watch the play. He is stunned to see that Rama is everything that the adivasi are - gentle, brave, a forest dweller and protector of mother-earth Sita. Except, he is also blue! Oonga gapes in awe as this blue hero saves Sita from the demon king Ravana. When he emerges after the play, Oonga believes he has become Rama! Painted blue, he returns to Pottacheru, unaware that he is now returning not to the home he left behind, but to a battlefield where the ‚Äòcompany‚Äô will do anything to take the adivasi's land away from them to mine it for Bauxite. As the Naxalite rebels and the CRPF soldiers go to war over Pottacheru, little Oonga, in his Rama avatar, believes he can save his home from this Ravana seeking to ravage it.  Cast  * Nandita Das as Hemla * Seema Biswas as Laxmi * Alyy Khan as Manoranjan * Salim Kumar as Kunja/Tramp * Vipin Sharma as Pradip * Anand Tiwari as Sushil * Priyanka Bose as Oongamma * Raju Singh (Debut)as Oonga  Production and development  The idea for Oonga came to Devashish Makhija from a journey through the tribal belt of South Orissa and North Andhra with the photo-journalist Javed Iqbal, and documentary filmmaker Faiza Ahmad Khan. The film was shot on a limited budget, on a tight schedule of 18 days. The story of Oonga found its seed in a small anecdote Devashish Makhija heard while in Koraput, Orissa. He recalls Sharanya Nayak, the local head of Action Aid there telling him how she had taken a group of adivasis to watch a dubbed version of Avatar (2009 film). They hollered and cheered the Na‚Äôvi right through the film as if they were their own fellow-tribals, fighting the same battles they were. Most of what is shown in the film is based on real incidents Makhija had witnessed or heard or read of. The character of Hemla was \\"inspired in part by the case of Soni Sori\\". About a fortnight before the filming of the abduction scene, in Koraput, Orissa, an adivasi MLA was actually kidnapped from a spot very near to the location for the planned shoot. Oonga was shot as a bilingual film, and both Oriya and Hindi is spoken in the film. The actors playing Naxalites and the CRPF were from Mumbai, and the actors playing the adivasis were from Orissa, while Nandita Das speaks both languages.  Critical reception  The film received several favourable reviews. Josh Hurtado of Twitch Film described the film as \\"a complicated tale of a complicated existence in a place where simplicity still reigns\\" and praised the beauty of the Indian landscape in the film. Louis Proyect of the New York Indian Film Festival called it \\"the first film I have seen out of India that takes up the cause of the Adivasi.\\" Arnesh Ghose of Man's World praised the cinematography and music, and commented favourably on Raju Singh's performance, while Saibal Chaterjee from Civil Society Online said that the film \\"is remarkably free from the good-versus-evil narrative dynamics that define mainstream Hindi cinema.\\" Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter said that Oonga \\"does a pretty good job explaining why the regional police and the Naxalites, Maoist-inspired guerrillas coming from native tribes, are in a standoff in modern India\\"; she also praised the cinematography and the actors.

In Prague Chandan meets a gypsy girl, Elena. This girl becomes the love of his life, his inspiration and also the pain of his soul because his past from India refuses to leave him alone. Chandan's experiences have made him mistrust his own shadow and his insecurities have made his life a living hell. His only ally in his darkest times is his friend Arfie but then it is revealed at the end that Arfie perhaps does not exist and Gulshan is an extension of Chandan himself suggesting that it was Chandan who created these characters in his head.

History They were formed in Thessaloniki, Greece, by drummer Stergios Kourou, along with guitarist Kosta Vreto and bass player Kostas Scandalis (all 3 of them members of progsters Horizon‚Äôs End). Wardrum were originally fronted by Uli Jon Roth‚Äôs Italian singer Piero Leporale, while front-man Yannis Papadopoulos joined them as lead vocalist in the early 2012. Their debut album ‚ÄúSpadework‚Äù was released by Steel Gallery Records on the 20th of April 2011 and the band was directly rated as one of the most promising bands in Greece. The Spadework Line-Up did a live performance only once, opening for Crimson Glory‚Äôs show in Thessaloniki on 22/10/2011. In February 2012 the band parted ways with Leporale and found a local singer, in order to be more flexible and work easier. Yannis Papadopoulos took over the band‚Äôs front-man position and they immediately recorded ‚ÄúDesolation‚Äù which was released on 25/04/2012. On October‚ÄìDecember of the same year the band toured all over Greece to support the new album and managed to create a solid core of fans who have shown their support by voting the band in the Metal Hammer magazine‚Äôs annual polls as the fourth best Greek band.

After the Italian defeat at Keren in April 1941, Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta withdrew his forces to the mountain stronghold at Amba Alagi. The mountain had galleries carved into the rock to protect the defending troops and hold ample ammunition and stores and the Italian troops thought themselves to be impregnable. According to other sources, however, the fortress was easily defendable thanks to its position and the mountainous terrain, but lacked food and water, so that Marshal Enrico Caviglia later criticised the Duke for having chosen it for his last stand, calling the Amba Alagi \\"uno scoglio senz'acqua e senza viveri\\" (\\"a rock with neither water nor food\\").Italia d'oltremare: storie dei territori italiani dalla conquista alla cadutaGli italiani in Africa Orientale ‚Äì 3. La caduta dell'Impero The initial attacks on the approaches to Amba Alagi by British troops under Major-General Mayne from the north, commenced on 4 May with a pincer from the eastern and western sides. There was hard fighting in the jagged mountainous terrain but Mayne's troops were joined on 12 May by Brigadier Dan Pienaar's 1st South African Brigade, which had captured the Italian garrison of Dessie (20 April) located south of Amba Alagi, and by 14 May Amba Alagi was completely surrounded. A final assault was planned for the next day but a lucky strike by an artillery shell hit an Italian fuel dump, sending a stream of oil into the last remaining Italian drinking water, forcing the garrison to end its resistance.Compton Mackenzie, Eastern Epic, pp. 67‚Äì70 The Italian commander began ceasefire negotiations on 16 May 1941.

It tells the story of Giovanni Bruno, the lone survivor of a mine disaster that killed 97 of his co-workers, and the apocalyptic cult that forms around him. The main action of the novel is set in and around the fictional town of West Condon. The disaster in the novel is closely based on the 1951 coal mine explosion in West Frankfort, Illinois. In 2014, Coover published a sequel, The Brunist Day of Wrath, set five years later. Publication history The Origin of the Brunists was first published by Putnam. Initially, however, the book was not released. The novel's editor had problems getting the dust jacket, then Putnam fired the editor and rejected the novel. The book was listed as an alternate selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club, but those who ordered it were told it was \\"temporarily out of print\\". When the novel won the Washington Post award for best first novel, Coover, upon contacting Putnam, was told \\"Yes, we've heard, but let's understand one thing right now, we are not spending another goddamned nickel on this book, is that clear?\\" Copies were made available, but the book would not earn back its $2000 advance. It was published (1967, 1971) in paperback by Ballantine, and then republished (1978) in hardcover by Viking, paperback by Bantam, following the qualified success and notoriety of The Public Burning. Plot summary Prologue: The Sacrifice The End of the World is scheduled for the weekend, 18th and 19 April. The Brunists, trying to dodge media attention and hostile neighbors, engage in a reckless run on dark narrow roads, and one of their cars goes off into a ditch, killing Marcella Bruno, the sister of Giovanni. Part I: The White Bird On the evening of January 8, the night shift is beginning at Deepwater Number 9 mine. An explosion traps 98 miners. By the time rescue workers finish, they find only one miner still alive, Giovanni Bruno, but in a coma from carbon monoxide poisoning. A note from one of the miners, popular lay preacher Ely Collins is recovered, addressed to his wife: The Nortons, Wylie and Eleanor, have moved frequently. Eleanor's gift for over a decade has been to communicate with various spirits, the main one named Domiron, and this has always led to harassment until they leave. Eleanor is disturbed that she did not receive any clear warning of the mine disaster. Justin \\"Tiger\\" Miller, editor of the West Condon Chronicle, leads the local newspaper coverage of the tragedy. A huge sports hero of the town in his high school days, he got out of West Condon, and inexplicably came back. His atheism is tolerated. Abner Baxter runs his family in an abusive, fundamentalist way. He is Ely's successor at lay preacher at his church. Part I ends with Bruno waking up. Part II: The Sign Eleanor Norton receives new spirit messages, convincing herself that Bruno is the key step forward in the cosmic order. In particular, he is no longer the human he was, but has come back as a spirit entity made flesh. Bruno is released from the hospital, with the town celebrating, although he is mostly incapacitated. The Collins widow believes her husband forecast the end of the world for the 8th of March, and invites people to the Bruno house for that evening, a Sunday. Many come, including Justin Miller, as a neutral reporter, and Abner Baxter as a lay pastor. But as midnight approaches, Baxter delivers an impromptu sermon condemning false prophets and walks out, leading most of the crowd away. The disappointment of the few who stay behind turns into elation when Bruno speaks a few words, \\"The coming ... of ... light! Sunday ... week\\", which is quickly interpreted as a new prediction of doomsday. Two of the older Baxter children play at superheroes around town. Originally Batman and Robin, they discover a human hand and rename themselves Black Hand and Black Peter, and now play at being supervillains. They engage in criminal mischief throughout the town. Miller starts an affair with a nurse, Happy Bottom. But he is finding himself slowly falling in love with Marcella Bruno. He is taking extensive notes on the Brunists, but is unable to find any story worth publishing. A lawyer, Ralph Himebaugh, whose hobby has been the numerology of disasters over the years, comes to the conclusion that the Brunists have the last missing bits of information that dovetails with his years of research, and so he joins them. Part II ends with the second apocalyptic meeting fizzling out, until the news comes that the Collins house was burning down. Part III: Passage The fire attracts a lot of attention, and forces the town leaders to face up to the Brunist cult, which is now calling for the end of the world on the 19th of April, the Sunday after Easter. On the 8th of April, the Wednesday of Holy Week, Miller goes national with the story, bringing a lot of attention, both good and bad, to the Brunists and West Condon. Before the news actually breaks, Marcella visits Miller at the Chronicle plant after everyone has supposedly gone home. They come close to starting an affair, but Miller wants her to know what he has done, and asks her to run off with him. She feels entirely betrayed, and runs off. Unbeknownst to either of them, Lou Jones, Miller's chief reporter, was present and took photographs of them naked. Jones is fired. The Chronicle plant is vandalized on Easter. Part III ends with several little stories about how various West Condon residents are getting ready to deal with a second \\"Holy\\" Week, that of the Brunists. Part IV: The Mount National reporters are descending on West Condon. The Brunists are attracting new members, from nearby towns, nationally, and internationally. Deepwater Clearwater, the mining company, announces its decision to not reopen the mine. Several locals earnestly attempt to deprogram any Brunist that will talk to them, and mostly just worsen tensions. Himebaugh reacts wildly, destroying papers and documents. Marcella takes to bed and refuses to eat the entire week. The Brunists gather at a local hill Saturday night, leaving Marcella behind. But she runs to join them, following the lights on the dark road, and is killed when Abner Baxter, driving, knocks her into a ditch. (This is the scene described in the prologue.) Baxter is horrified, and on the spot becomes a fervent Brunist himself. Her body is taken up in an impromptu bier made from a lawn chair. Himebaugh is noticeably missing. Miller, in the course of covering the event, overhears from an out-of-town reporter about how Jones is back, reporting for some other paper, and he's showing off nude photos of Miller and Marcella. Enraged, Miller finds Jones near the main circle of Brunists, and attempts to assault him. But the Brunists see Miller, and blaming him for the death of Marcella, they viciously beat him, until \\"he departed from this world, passing on to his reward,\\" all while Jones photographs the attack. Part IV ends with the town limping back to normal afterwards. The Brunists are not prosecuted, but are allowed to move on, entirely unwelcome in West Condon, although Abner Baxter defiantly holds secret meetings. In searching Himebaugh's house, his cats are found, almost all drowned in his bathtub, while Himebaugh himself is not found for some time, having starved himself to death hiding in the Bruno bedroom. Epilogue: Return Miller turns out to be alive after all, having been rescued by Happy Bottom. He is recovering slowly at the hospital. While he is all in favor of leaving West Condon, Happy won't hear of it. As motivation, she tells him the Brunists are certainly going to return on their first anniversary, knowing he will want to cover that story. Mine disaster source In December 1951, there was a major explosion about 8 PM at a coal mine in West Frankfort, Illinois. 119 men were killed, and as in the novel, there was one survivor, who had been found with a small group separated from the rest. Also as in the novel, the local high school basketball game, begun at 7:30, was abandoned, and the gymnasium was converted into a temporary morgue. Coover, at the time, was attending college in Carbondale, Illinois, two counties away. His family lived in Herrin, one county away, where his father was a newspaper editor. Awards Coover won the 1967 William Faulkner Foundation Award for the \\"best first novel of the year.\\" The three judges found the novel to be \\"both comic and serious, worldly and religious.\\" Reception Further reading * Review. * Discussion of religion in Coover's Brunist novels.

Later, he adapted the play into a novel. In 2011 Van den Broek and Guido Van Meir once again adapted the novel into a movie. Plot Groenten uit Balen is based upon real events which took place in the Belgian community Balen. In 1971 it turned out the workmen of Vieille Montagne in the other Belgian plants had a much higher salary for similar work. The workers in Balen wanted a raise. This led to a dispute between the workmen, the trade unions and the directors board. The 1500 workmen in Balen went on a strike, but this was not accepted by the trade unions. As a result, the workmen did not earn any money at all. The strike went on for 9 weeks. Many charity was set up by inhabitants of Mol and Balen. Jef Sleeckx, a politician, convinced the banks to cancel payments temporarily for affected workmen. Houselords did not ask rent during the strike. Shops gave food for free or gave the impacted workmen a temporary job. At the end, the directors board agreed and the workmen even got a higher wage than requested. The novel is about the fictive family Debruyker. Father Jan is unskilled and works at Vieille Montagne. He frequently writes letters to king Baudouin of Belgium. His wife Clara does the householding and always intercepts the letters and burns them. Their daughter Germaine is 18-year-old and just finished high school. Grandfather is retired and lives in. The family lives in a working- class neighborhood not that far from Vieille Montagne. Germaine hopes for a better life. Her father does not earn that much and they live in a small, rather poor environment. The houses have no luxury and the toilets are still outside, which obliges the families to use outdated chamber pots during night or freeze periods. Furthermore, Germaine is convinced all earth in a rather large area is poisoned with lead and zinc. There is already proof as there are almost no trees and plants. Life becomes complicated when a strike starts at Vieille Montagne. Grandfather is from another generation where workmen had almost no rights. According to him, Jan should be happy he has a job and he should follow the decisions of the directors board even if he has a lower wage in comparison with the other factories. He forces his son to go to work and forbids him to go on strike. Jan wants to follow the advice of his father, but once at the factory it seems those who wants to work are being thrown in the canal or beaten up by the other workmen. This results in a strike of all 1500 employees. Jan writes a letter to the king and requests him to do something about the situation. Of course, the letter is again burnt by Clara. In meantime, Germaine works at the GB-warehouse in Mol as a cashier but gets fired after she stole glue. This means the family has no income at all. Thanks to the actions of politician Jef Sleeckx, their situation becomes somehow better. Germaine meets Luc, a student at the university, during a party. They fall in love. Not much later, Germaine gets ill and must vomit frequently. After a visit to the doctor, it seems she is pregnant. As this is a scandal and abortion is a taboo, Germaine should marry Luc. However, Luc does not want to raise the child and focusses on his studies. That's why Clara decides to visit his parents who live in a mansion. Although Clara is a rather assertive person, she is bribed with expensive chocolates and drinks. Luc gets aware of Germain's situation and changes his mind. He does want to raise the child whilst combining his studies with some job. There is also good news from Vieille Montagne: the directors board decided to raise wages. Jan once again writes a letter to the king to thank him. Jan is convinced his previous letter was partially the key to the solution. Title The title is based upon a writing error in Jan his last letter to the king. He ends this letter with a salutation. He wants to write \\"Groeten uit Balen\\", which means \\"Greetings from Balen\\", but scribes \\"Groenten uit Balen\\", which means \\"Vegetables from Balen\\".

Description  left Condylopyge is isopygous with cephalon and pygidium of approximately equal size. The characteristic lateral expansion of the frontal glabellar lobe, occipital structures, and pygidial axis with three pairs of lateral lobes and a terminal piece differentiate Condylopygidae from all other agnostids. Condylopyge is easily distinguished from its sister taxon, Pleuroctenium, because the frontal glabellar lobe does not extend partially around the posterior glabellar lobe. Furthermore the frontal glabellar lobe is never bisected medially as in Pleuroctenium. The pygidium may carry a pair of backwardly directed spines, but this also occurs regularly in Pleuroctenium.WHITTINGTON, H.B. et al. Part O, Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology.

It runs from Kaiserslautern along the Lauter river to Lauterecken. The railway, which was opened in 1883, has only regional importance. Deutsche Bundesbahn planned in the 1980s to close the line. Its existence has now been secured since the establishment of Deutsche Bahn. While freight traffic was discontinued in the 1990s, there has been growth in passenger demand. History In about 1860, a committee was formed called the Notabeln des Glan- und Lautertales (Notables of the Glan and Lauter valleys), which was based in Wolfstein. It campaigned for a railway line that would branch off from the Palatine Ludwig Railway in Kaiserslautern and continue along the Lauter and the lower Glan valleys, connecting in Staudernheim with the Rhine-Nahe Railway, which was completed in 1860. A concession for the line was granted in the mid-1860s. The committee sent a proposal to the Ludwigshafen-based headquarters of the Palatine Ludwig Railway Company (Pf√§lzische Ludwigsbahn-Gesellschaft). The project was in competition with the line along the Alsenz. After the opening, in 1870, of the Alsenz Valley Railway (Alsenztalbahn), which at the beginning was seen as a route for long- distance traffic, the probability of a rail link via the Lauter dropped significantly. A plan for a main line railway was prepared in 1874. The estimated cost of a line along the Lauter including a branch to Otterberg totalled 3.58 million guilders. At first, there was a dispute over the route. For example, the town of Otterberg, which is located outside the Lauter valley, advocated a route through Otterberg. A new petition of the communities on the Lauter in 1877 supported a route along the Lauter. It was decided to build the Lauter Railway as a secondary line and the plan for a branch to Otterberg was postponed. The Palatine Northern Railway Company (Gesellschaft der Pf√§lzischen Nordbahnen), which had been part of the Palatinate Railway (Pfalzbahn) since 1870, received a concession for the line on 9 May 1880. The plans were delayed because of disagreements over the route and problems in acquiring the necessary land. On 18 February 1882, work began with a groundbreaking ceremony on the site of today‚Äôs Kaiserslautern West station. Due to the expected heavy freight traffic at the original Kaiserslautern West station (Westbahnhof), the section to this station was designed as a main line railway, while the remaining section to Lauterecken was designed as a secondary line with lighter trackwork. The railway was not built gradually from the south to the north, but instead it was built relatively simultaneously by different companies. The line opened on 15 November 1883 after a test run had confirmed its capacity for operations as early as 17 September. Further development (1883‚Äì1911) In the first decades there was a structural and operational oddity at Kaiserslautern West station: the part handling passenger services was built as a terminal station so that passenger trains to Lauterecken had to reverse into the station. Trains running in the opposite direction had to reverse out the station and run backwards to Kaiserslautern Central Station (Hauptbahnhof). Lampertsm√ºhle- Otterbach station in 1887 In 1895, the superstructure of the Lauter Valley Railway was reinforced to adapt to the requirements for the operation of freight trains because of the construction of the lower Glan Valley Railway from Lauterecken. The Lauterecken‚ÄìOdernheim line opened in 1896 was the direct continuation of the Lauter Valley Railway. To the north of the original terminus at Lauterecken an additional halt (Haltepunkt) was built in the district of Veldenzstadt to give access for the residents at the northern edge of the town and to the central Glan valley. From 1897, it was connected to the Rhine-Nahe Railway at Staudernheim. In order to link the Altenglan‚ÄìLauterecken section of the Glan Valley Railway opened in 1904, Lauterecken-Grumbach station was opened at the junction in the same year as an interchange station. Otherwise, it would have been necessary to build the Glan Valley Railway on a more complex and expensive route through Lauterecken. Until the completion of Glan Valley Railway in 1904, there were through trains from Kaiserslautern to Staudernheim. The former Lauterecken station was then reduced to the status of a halt and the Lauterecken halt opened in 1896 just to the south of the junction was closed. On 1 January 1909, the Lauter Valley Railway, along with the other railway lines within the Palatinate, was taken over by the Royal Bavarian State Railways. In 1912, the stations of Kaisersm√ºhle, Sambach, Oberweiler-Tiefenbach and Lauterecken were abandoned for lack of profitability. By May 1912, the barriers had been removed at 42 level crossings, as a result of rationalisation. Two years later, Stahlhausen- Rutsweiler station also had to be closed because of low usage. World wars and the interwar period (1911‚Äì1949) The opening of the branch to Otterbach in 1911, and the Bach Railway (Bachbahn, so called because all of its stations had names ending in ‚Äúbach‚Äù, i.e. ‚Äúbrook‚Äù) to Weilerbach, which was extended in 1920 to Reichenbach, gave the Lauter Valley Railway greater importance, especially its southern stretch, since the passenger trains on either route often continued to Kaiserslautern. On 1 November 1917, during the First World War, the intermediate stops in Kaulbach and Lohnweiler were closed. Eleven months later, however, they were reactivated. In 1920, the line became part of the newly founded Deutsche Reichsbahn. In 1922, there were plans for the stations in Kaulbach, Lohnweiler and Rossbach-Stahlhausen to close due to low use, but local protests prevented this. In 1923 and 1924, so-called Regiebetrieb (‚Äúdirected operation‚Äù of the railways by the Allied military during the Occupation of the Ruhr) was imposed under the control of France, which had occupied the Palatinate. The local population boycotted the railway during the occupation. Therefore, reinforced German Post Office bus routes and private trucks were used as an alternative to the French-controlled railways. In addition, the German Ministry of Transport refused to cooperate with the occupiers in the operation of the railway, so the French took rail operations into their own hands. Since the military officers involved did not fully understand the German operating instructions and the safe-working systems, railway operation during this time were hazardous. The time required to travel over the whole Lauter Valley Railway at that time was almost two hours. The Reichsbahndirektion (railway division of) Ludwigshafen founded in 1922, to which the Lauter Valley Railway had belonged, was dissolved in 1936. Apart from Lauterecken-Grumbach station, which henceforth belonged to the Reichsbahndirektion Mainz, along with the adjacent northern Glan Valley Railway, the line came under the control of the Reichsbahndirektion Saarbr√ºcken. Since the timetable could often not be met during the Second World War, a \\"list of essential services‚Äù appeared in 1941. Therefore, at least three trains had to run between Kaiserslautern and Lauterecken. In December 1944, Lauterecken-Grumbach station, due to its function as a railway junction, was the victim of a series of air raids, which among other things burnt down the roundhouse. In March 1945, there was another air raid.  Deutsche Bundesbahn (1949‚Äì1993)  After the Second World War Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) took over operations on the line and incorporated them into the railway division of Mainz. The latter received those sections controlled by the former railway division of Saarbr√ºcken that were located within the newly created federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In 1951 a new station called Kaiserslautern-Pfaffwerk was opened at the Pfaff factory between the Kaiserslautern Hauptbahnhof and Kaiserslautern West station. As part of the dissolution of the railway division of Mainz in 1971, the line was transferred to the control of the railway division of Saarbr√ºcken again. Sunday traffic was abandoned on the Lauter Valley Railway and replaced by buses in 1975. The operation of steam locomotives on the line ended on 26 September 1975. In 1983, the Lauter Valley Railway celebrated its 100th anniversary with a Trans Europ Express service between Kaiserslautern and Lauterecken. Battery electric multiple unit DB Class ETA 150 in Lauterecken-Grumbach station in 1986 Since the 1950s, passenger services have been abandoned on several adjacent lines in the western North Palatine Uplands‚Äîincluding the Lampertsm√ºhle- Otterbach‚ÄìOtterberg branch line (1954) and the line to Reichenbach (1972)‚Äîand the closure of the Lauter Valley Railway was also under discussion. This intention was expressed mainly by the railway division of Saarbr√ºcken, which also gradually ended services on the adjacent Glan Valley Railway at the same time. After passenger services were discontinued on the northern section of the Glan Valley Railway from Lauterecken-Grumbach to Staudernheim in 1986, the Lauter Valley Railway and the Landstuhl‚ÄìKusel railway were the only lines that were spared from the wave of closure of branch lines in the region. On 9 June 1986, Deutsche Bundesbahn and Rhineland-Palatinate entered into an agreement, which divided all the railway lines in the state into three categories. This allowed the efficiency of the Lauter Valley Railway to be verified. In the following years the Lauter Valley Railway was threatened with closure, but the public and local politicians managed to preserve the line. In 1969, Deutsche Bundesbahn ended passenger services at Kaiserslautern West station and replaced it with a new station of the same name. This is right at the junction of the spur to the original terminus. In the late 1980s, the terminus was closed as a freight yard, but for several years it still operated as a siding. In 1991, plans were developed to allow the Lauter Valley Railway to run within Kaiserslautern as a \\"City Railway\\" (Citybahn). The trains from the West Station would operate on a route through the city centre to terminate near the town hall at a newly built \\"City Station‚Äù (Citybahnhof). There would also have been a branch from the Lauter Valley Railway to return passenger services to Weilerbach. However, financial constraints and a lack of political support prevented the implementation of these plans. Deutsche Bahn (since 1994) 628 458 in Lauterecken On 1 January 1994, the German railway reform came into force and ownership of the line was transferred from Deutsche Bundesbahn to Deutsche Bahn AG. As the states were now responsible for local transport, the line was no longer under the threat of closure. On 20 August 1995, the first \\"car-free day in the Lauter valley\\" (Autofreies Lautertal) was celebrated with the reintroduction of Sunday services. The trains were very busy that day. In 2000, the Lauter Valley Railway, along with the entire Western Palatinate, was initially part of the Westpfalz-Verkehrsverbundes (Western Palatinate Transport Association, WVV), but six years later this was absorbed by the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (Rhine-Neckar Transport Association, VRN). In the same year, the Kreimbach-Kaulbach station was opened, replacing the existing stations in Kreimbach and Kaulbach. Also in 2005, the platforms at the stations of Olsbr√ºcken, Lampertsm√ºhle-Otterbach, Heinzenhausen and Wolfenstein were upgraded to make them accessible for the disabled. At the same time Deutsche Bahn, carried out a pilot project to install a system for controlling train operations by radio, but was unsuccessful. In the period from 16 to 18 December 2005, the previous mechanical interlocking technology on the Lauter Valley Railway, which had been used for over 100 years, was replaced by an electronic interlocking technology of the ‚ÄúBruchsal G‚Äù type, which had originally been planned to be installed in the autumn of the previous year. Since then the railway facilities have been controlled by an electronic interlocking at Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe. This has reduced costs on the line. Route The route follows the entire length of the Lauter river. Shortly before Kaiserslautern West, it runs through a cutting and then passes under the Lauter viaduct of Autobahn 6. The only tunnel along the line is the 91 metre-long Eisenknopf Tunnel in Wolfenstein. Shortly before reaching the terminus at Lauterecken-Grumbach, the line crosses a bridge over the Glan. First, the line runs through the city of Kaiserslautern, from Lampertsm√ºhle- Otterbach to Olsbr√ºcken it runs through the district of Kaiserslautern. The rest of the line is located in the district of Kusel.  Operations Passengers At the time beginning of operations, three pairs of trains services ran between Kaiserslautern and Lauterecken. In 1896, services were extended with the opening of the lower Glan Valley Railway to Odernheim and its extension to Staudernheim in 1897. Continuous services from the Lauter Valley Railway to Staudernheim ended with the opening of the remaining sections of the Glan Valley Railway in 1904. From 1906, some trains ran only on part of the line, such as between Lauterecken and Wolfenstein, between Kaiserslautern and Olsbr√ºcken and between Kaiserslautern West and Lampertsm√ºhle-Otterbach. After the Bach Railway and the line to Otterberg were opened for passengers, their trains ran mostly to Kaiserslautern, so the Kaiserslautern‚ÄìLampertsm√ºhle-Otterbach section had increased traffic. From 1966 to 1969, two daily express trains ran towards Kaiserslautern. Sunday services ended in 1975 and Saturday services ended seven years later. Sunday services were restored in 1995. Mostly trains ran via Lauterecken to the lower Glan Valley Railway. Thus, the summer timetable of 1971 included two pairs of trains on the line bound for Staudernheim or Meisenheim. The line is listed in the Deutsche Bahn time table as route number (KBS) 673 and as Regionalbahn line 66 of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (Rhine-Neckar Transport Association, VRN) network. In 2000, during the State Garden Show in Kaiserslautern, the Karlsruhe‚ÄìKaiserslautern Regional-Express service was extended to Lampertsm√ºhle-Otterbach to cope with the number of visitors. Train crossings took place in Lampertsm√ºhle and Wolfstein until 2008. Since the timetable change in December 2008, trains no longer cross at these stations, but instead cross mainly at Olsbr√ºcken station. Thus, the average travel time was shortened by six minutes, but there is now a shorter guaranteed time to transfer to and from Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn services in Kaiserslautern. Freight Freight always had a minor role on the line. The Lauter Valley Railway had a greater role in freight only during the two world wars. In the first years of its existence, there were no separate freight trains, but instead there were mixed trains at most.

California, 571 U.S. ___ (2014), was a U.S. Supreme Court case that explored the limits of Georgia v. Randolph, a 2006 case that held that consent to search a dwelling is invalid in the presence of an objecting co- resident. Fernandez, however, held that when the objecting co-resident is removed for objectively reasonable purposes (such as lawful arrest), the remaining resident may validly consent to search. Case aspects Supreme Court Case law precedent Fernandez v. California is governed by two cases: The 1974 case United States v. Matlock and the 2005 case Georgia v. Randolph. In Matlock the U.S. Supreme Court laid out the so-called \\"co-occupant consent rule\\". This rule means that anyone who has ‚Äúcommon authority‚Äù over the home can consent to a search of the home. The Supreme Court defined \\"common authority\\" as ‚Äúmutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched. Then they arrested him.‚Äù In essence the court decided that any one person who is a ‚Äújoint occupant‚Äù can consent to a police search of the shared residence, without a search warrant. In Georgia v. Randolph the Court limited the holding of Matlock. In Randolph the court decided that when co-occupants who are disagreeing whether to let the police search their dwelling the police can't conduct a search, if a ‚Äúphysically present‚Äù co-occupant objects that search. Case background When police arrived at Fernandez's apartment, they believed a suspect in a gang-related assault had just entered. While approaching the apartment they heard screaming and fighting occurring inside. Police knocked on the apartment's door, which was answered by Fernandez's bloodied girlfriend. Believing that Fernandez may have assaulted his girlfriend, police attempted to separate the two. Fernandez refused to follow the police's directive to step away from his girlfriend and yelled ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a right to come in here. I know my rights.‚Äù The officers soon realized that Fernandez was the suspect in the gang-related assault and arrested him for that crime. About an hour later the police came back to ask Fernandez's girlfriend for consent to search the apartment, which she gave. Fernandez later challenged the lawfulness of this third-party consent. Counsel to Fernandez were attorneys Jeff Fischer and Gerald Peters. Supreme Court Decision By a vote of six to three, the Court ruled that the search which followed the arrest of defendant Fernandez did not violate the Constitution, because Fernandez was no longer physically there and had been removed for fair reasons. Respect for the girlfriend's independent voluntary consent requires that it be honored. The three dissenting judges argued that the girlfriend had been pressured into consenting, and that police should have gotten a search warrant once they knew Fernandez objected to the search.

Dumas' mother had wanted to become a nurse, but no local nursing schools admitted African-American students at the time and her family could not afford to send her to college further away. When Dumas spoke at the Columbia University 2003 commencement for health sciences graduates, she said \\"From infancy, I was told that when I grew up, I was going to be a nurse, not just an ordinary nurse, mind you, but one who would be admired by people all around the country -- not only for her personal achievements, but more importantly, for her contributions toward improving the welfare of others.\\" She obtained her nursing degree at Dillard University in New Orleans in 1951. Following graduation, she took her first jobs as a substitute teacher in Natchez and as the Nurse Director of Dillard University's Student Health Center. Dumas died of cancer in a Houston hospice on July 22, 2007. Work Dumas earned a master's degree in nursing in 1961 from Yale School of Nursing and joined the school's faculty, ultimately becoming an associate professor and the chair of psychiatric nursing. While at Yale, she served as a member of the Board of Public School Education in New Haven and helped mental health professionals get involved with parents and students during the school riots of the 1960s. She worked simultaneously as Director of Nursing at the Connecticut Mental Health Center and as Chair of the Yale Department of Psychiatric Nursing. Beginning in the 1970s, Dumas held leadership positions with the National Institute of Mental Health. She was the chief of the organization's Psychiatric Nursing Education Branch. Between 1979 and 1981, she was the first nurse, female, or African-American to serve as the deputy director of the NIMH. In 1979 she was appointed by Patricia Roberts Harris, secretary of Health and Human Services, to the position of deputy director. During her time at the NIMH, according to her obituary in Nursing Outlook, she \\"played a major role in redirecting professional training to meet the needs of the unserved and underserved, a policy focus that continues to this day.\\" While at NIMH, Dumas earned a doctoral degree from Union Institute. Dumas worked for the University of Michigan for over 20 years, and she served three terms there as the nursing school dean. Dumas was the first Black female dean at Michigan, but left the position when she was appointed Vice Provost for Health and the Lucille Cole Professor of Nursing. Dumas served terms as president of the American Academy of Nursing and the National League for Nursing. She was a member of the Institute of Medicine and a fellow of the A.K. Rice Institute.

It was founded in 1931 by a particular union of amateur clubs. The original symbol of the team was the barbouna or red Mullet (trigli). Its colors are black and yellow, which are the colors of the Byzantine flag. Today, the club keeps its colors, but the symbol has been changed to a two-headed eagle, the Byzantine symbol. Foundation and first years The founders of the team were Anastasios Lyrantzis, Stellios Tseropoulos, Dimitrios, Rigas and Vasillis Voudouris. They originated the idea of uniting many local, unofficial athletic clubs like Vyzantio and Propontida, which were founded by teenagers or children. The founders of Triglia delegated a lawyer to write the statute for the foundation of one team with the name Athletic Football Union Triglia Rafinas (Greek: ŒëŒ∏ŒªŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ†ŒøŒ¥ŒøœÉœÜŒ±ŒπœÅŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒàŒΩœâœÉŒπœÇ Œ§œÅŒπŒ≥ŒªŒØŒ± Œ°Œ±œÜŒÆŒΩŒ±œÇ). Its first colors were black and white and first symbol the red mullet (trigli). Later, the symbol changed to a two-headed eagle, the Byzantine symbol. The first management board was composed of Anastasios Lyrantzis (president), Kyriakos Drakoulis (vice president), Stellios Tseropoulos (secretary), Vasilis Voudouris (general leader) and Dimitrios and Rigas (efors). In 1934 the Union of Football Clubs in Athens (Œï.Œ†.Œ£.Œë) was founded, and Triglia Rafinas was one of its founding members. The \\"black page\\" of 1935‚Äì36 Between 1935 and 1936 Triglia ceased activities because of a leadership crisis and the lack of a field. At this time, many people exploited it and created a new team with the name \\"Panrafinaikos\\", but it never had a statute or fans and was soon dissolved. In 1936, Triglia was reorganized, but the site of its old field had been taken for another use. Therefore, the field was moved to its present location. However, the new site was full of sand and other types of rubbish. Therefore, the Triglia fans repeatedly went over the site using their horses and plows, trying to make it level. After 1957, a fence was built around the field. During the German- Italian occupation At the time of the German and Italian occupation of Greece, sports events were limited. However, some young people who had played for Triglia asked the Italian commander to allow them to set up a football team, to play some friendly matches against the teams of the occupation forces. The commander agreed, but he imposed one condition. \\"In your office, you will talk only about sports\\", he said. The people of Triglia ignored this command for two years, however. Members of the National Liberation Front (Greek: ŒïŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫œå ŒëœÄŒµŒªŒµœÖŒ∏ŒµœÅœâœÑŒπŒ∫œå ŒúŒ≠œÑœâœÄŒø) hid and met in the team's offices. The team operated in this way until 1944, when the occupation forces left Greece. During the years after the war - the first titles In the years which followed the Second World War people who did not approve of the name \\"Triglia\\" tried to create other teams to replace Triglia Rafinas, such as Mikrasiatiki and Panrafinaikos. These teams never had fans and they were dissolved. In this period the team's name was changed to Athletic Club Triglia Rafinas. Triglia Rafinas competed for E.P.S.A's championships and cups, with many successes. Specifically, the first title Triglia won was the championship of Gamma E.P.S.A. (1964), and it was promoted to Beta E.P.S.A., which it won in 1965, winning the promotion to Alpha E.P.S.A. Four years later, they won the championship of Alpha E.P.S.A. and were promoted to National Categories. However, the dictatorship relegated the team to Gamma E.P.S.A. The team from Rafina returned to Beta E.P.S.A. by winning the championship of Gamma E.P.S.A. in 1969 and in 1971 they won the championship of Beta E.P.S.A., but in 1972, in Alpha E.P.S.A., they were beaten by Liosia, losing the promotion to Beta Ethniki. In 1988, AC Triglia Rafinas became the champion of Alpha E.P.S.A. for the second time in its history, but in the same year they lost against Pefki in the final of the E.P.S.A cup by a score of 5‚Äì3 (penalty), at the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium. From 1988 to 1989, Triglia took part in the championship of Delta Ethniki . 1988‚Äì2010 - the great promotion to Delta Ethniki In the evolution of E.P.S.A, E.P.S.AN.A., Triglia, under the coaching of Stathis Aslanoglou, who became Triglia's coach in 2007, took part in the final of the E.P.S.AN.A cup in 2009 in Spata's Stadium, where they lost on penalties to Pampaianikos, by a score of 1‚Äì1 (regular time) and 4‚Äì2 (penalties), winning the second place. The next year they became the champions of Alpha E.P.S.AN.A., and were promoted to Delta Ethniki. The same year, 2010, Triglia qualified for the cup final, in Pallinis's stadium, losing by a score of 1‚Äì2 to Oropos, ranking in second place for the second time.

She contributed to anthropological research in Wall Street culture.An Anthropologist on What's Wrong with Wall Street, Time, July 22, 2009 Ho is a Marshall Scholar. Life Karen Ho grew up in a middle-class household outside Memphis. Her father was a Taiwanese immigrant and doctor. She earned her undergraduate and master's degrees at Stanford University and got her PhD in anthropology from Princeton University.Margaret Mead meets Morgan Stanley, Princeton Alumni Weekly, September 23, 2009 Work From 1996 to 1997, Ho took a leave of absence from graduate school to work on Wall Street in order to observe the culture there. From 1998 to 1999, she conducted over 100 interviews with Wall Street employees. Her thesis and book based on her field work and interviews conclude that Wall Street culture informs employee decisions and firm strategies, and therefore have profound impact on the economy at large. Ho's key ideas are that the cultures of \\"smartness\\" and \\"hard work\\" on Wall Street engender a certain form of elitism which disengage investment bankers from the rest of society. The financial-based motivation of Wall Street employees is enforced by a compensation structure which rewards employees for closing deals regardless of the deals' long-term success. Furthermore, Wall Street celebrates \\"employee liquidity,\\" or the ease with which it hires and lays off employees, even during a bull market. These factors contribute to investment bankers adoption a \\"strategy of no strategy,\\" in which the only goal is to make money for the company (and thus themselves) in the short term. Further, Ho suggests that economic downturns are the inevitable consequence of this lack of foresight. Ho further discusses the fallacy of meritocracy on Wall Street. While banks often profess that their employees are \\"the smartest people in the world,\\" their concept of smartness encompasses a form of social aggressiveness and status that is typically reserved for affluent White males. The most lucrative and upwardly mobile side of investment banking comes from closing deals with top executives. Affluent White men are often more \\"well- liked\\" by executives, as they can be better able to play golf and talk about country clubs. Women and minorities typically need to prove themselves through less lucrative, technical aspects of banking. They must be careful in how they dress and who they interact with in order to avoid \\"class slippage\\" in the eyes of their co-workers and superiors. Ho is currently a professor at the University of Minnesota.

It was fought between pro-independence Republican revolutionaries led by Francisco Esteban G√≥mez and Spanish Royalist forces under the command of Pablo Morillo. The outcome was a Spanish defeat.  Background  The revolutionary leader Sim√≥n Bol√≠var arrived in the island of Margarita in May 1816. On 6 May 1816 Bol√≠var declared the Third Republic of Venezuela and an Assembly of Notables recognized Sim√≥n Bol√≠var as Supreme Chief in the church of Santa Ana. Bol√≠var then went on to the mainland. That year the Republicans were generally successful in their struggle with the Royalist forces. The Spanish general Pablo Morillo returned to Venezuela in December 1816, and decided to first take Margarita, then move on to Guayana Province, both important Republican bases. After some difficulties in collecting supplies and troops, Morillo sailed to Margarita in late June 1817, where he steadily gained control in a hard-fought campaign. On 24 July 1817 Morillo occupied the San Carlos de Borromeo Fortress at Pampatar, at the southeast tip of the island a few miles from Asunci√≥n. The revolutionaries had evacuated the castle and withdrawn to Asunci√≥n, where they concentrated. They were followed by Morillo's forces. The Spanish occupied the hill of Matasiete, which overlooked the city and its surroundings from the east, with a force of 2,000 infantry and 600 cavalry. There was no resistance to this move. The approach to the town was difficult, however, due to the rugged terrain that the defenders had fortified with redoubts, moats and parapets. Battle Pablo Morillo, the Spanish commander On 31 July 1817 Morillo launched the assault, which began at eight thirty in the morning. The struggle was fierce, with the Spanish pressing hard against the defensive front. In his later report on the battle, Morillo paid tribute to the stubborn courage of the republicans, who repelled repeated cavalry charges. During the course of the fighting, many unarmed men and women from the town joined the defenders, taking up the arms of those who had been killed or wounded. General Esteban G√≥mez himself was hit by bullets several times, and his horse was killed under him. The republican artillery batteries Carante and Libertad played an important role in the defense. The Libertad, commanded by Felipe Villalba, fired incessantly. The patriots also rolled huge boulders down the slope into the Spanish line. By four in the afternoon the battle had been decided, with the Republicans the victors. 559 of the royalist troops had been killed or wounded. On 1 August Morillo retired to the fortified position of Pampatar, followed by G√≥mez with a harassing force of 200 infantry and 300 horsemen.  Aftermath  The battle had saved the city, but the revolutionaries continued to lose ground to the Spanish in the island. By mid-August they held only Asunci√≥n and the fortaleza del norte. Morillo then heard that the revolutionaries on the mainland had captured Ciudad Guayana on 18 July, occupied Baja Guayana on 3 August, and were threatening Caracas. Morillo left the island without completing the conquest, but was unable to recover Guayana. The Republicans were in a stronger position after the campaign of 1817 than they had been before. La Asunci√≥n became the provisional capital of the independent Republic of Venezuela. A column has been erected on the site of the battle. The Castillo de San Carlos de Borromeo in Pampatar displays a painting that commemorates the battle, the most popular item in its collection. In 1974 Matasiete hill was decreed a Natural Monument of Margarita. G√≥mez Municipality, Nueva Esparta, birthplace of the victorious general, is named in his honor. The anniversary of the battle is now celebrated as a special holiday on Margarita. On 31 July 2012 a reenactment of the battle was staged at the site by over 500 volunteers.

In 2008, when the annual Royal International Air Tattoo was cancelled, the Kecskem√©t Air Show became that year's biggest air show held in Europe. ‚ÄûIt was without doubt the biggest European air show of 2008, after RIAT's cancellation, and certainly the best, thanks to a superb organizational effort, well-rounded programme, the number of display items, extensive supporting facilities, the welcoming atmosphere and the positive vibes at the show. It is unlikely a show like this will be seen again, also as some types like the Hungarian Mig-29 and Serbian Orao will soon leave service, but mainly because the programme was of such rare quality.‚Äù It was last held in August 2013. History Dutch F-16 rolling in front of the viewers after the display show Hungarian Mi-24, with a special livery, painted especially for the Air Show Serbian J-22 Orao during landing The first air show at Kecskem√©t was held on 18 and 19 August 1990. The show became the first occasion that NATO and Warsaw Pact military aircraft met in peaceful conditions, when two Soviet Air Force Mikoyan MiG-29s and two United States Air Force General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons arrived together. After a seven-year break, during which two air shows were held at Tasz√°r Air Base, the Air Show was again held at Kecskem√©t, on 24 and 25 May 1997. The next show, held the following year, celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Hungarian Defense Force, and the 60th anniversary of the Hungarian Air Force. As well as Hungarian Air Force MiG-29s, the show featured the Turkish Stars aerobatic team. The 2000 show, held on 20 and 21 May, saw the first appearance of the Slovakian White Albatrosses and the Italian Frecce Tricolori aerobatic teams. On 16 and 17 August 2003, Kecskem√©t Air Base hosted the biggest air show ever held in Hungary so far. Three air force aerobatic teams accepted invitations to attend: the Frecce Tricolori, the Patrouille de France and the Turkish Stars. After a planned two-year recess, the Air Show was held again in 2005, on 6 and 7 August. The organisers planned a huge gathering of Mikoyan-Gurevich aircraft. All air arms operating MiG aircraft were invited, but very few actually accepted, so the reunion was cancelled. The 2007 Air Show was held on 11 and 12 August. The Krila Oluje aerobatic team from Croatia performed for the first time. The next show was held the following year, on 16 and 17 August. This was the first occasion the Eurofighter Typhoon visited Hungary to participate at an air show. Also, one of the world's biggest military cargo aircraft, the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III made its first appearance at a Hungarian air show. The next show was two years later, on 7 and 8 August 2010. The French Dassault Rafale visited Hungary for the first time. This year's show provided the last opportunity for the public to see MiG-29s in Hungarian colors, as the Hungarian Air Force had announced it would retire its MiG-29s from active service, replacing them with Saab JAS 39 Gripens. At the end of the show, Hungarian MiG-29s simulated a dogfight situation against Gripen aircraft. In 2013 the Air Show was held on the weekend of 3‚Äì4 August.

Early life and adoption by dog pack Ivan Mishukov was born in Reutov on 6 May 1992. When he was four, he left his home to escape his mother and her alcoholic boyfriend. Ivan gained the dogs' trust by providing them with food, and in return, he was protected by the pack. Eventually, he was made pack-leader. Capture Mishukov was captured by Moscow police in 1998, when he was six. The police separated the boy from the dogs by leaving bait for the pack in a restaurant kitchen. Prior to capture, he had escaped the police three times, defended by the pack. Because he had lived among the dogs for only two years, he was able to re-learn language. He now speaks very fluently and intelligently, and has given interviews on Russian and Ukrainian National TV. He studied in military school and served in the Russian Army. Influence In 2009, his story influenced English playwright Hattie Naylor to write a play about his time on the streets called \\"Ivan and the Dogs.\\"Naylor, Hattie. Ivan and the Dogs.

The story of Ivan Mishukov caught the attention of Australian writer Eva Hornung, whose novel Dog Boy (2009) shares many of the same elements of Ivan's story, including capture by leaving bait at a restaurant.

Its ruins are located near Saraycƒ±k, a small village in the Kumluca district of Antalya Province, Turkey. History The history of the city is largely unknown because it was not mentioned by any ancient author. Only the ruins of the city give some information. The earliest phase of the city's walls dates to the Hellenistic period, with the last phase dating to the Byzantine period. Because of the five churches which have been identified the city likely became more important with the spread of Christianity in Late Antiquity. Archaeological investigations T. A. B. Spratt visited the site for two days in 1842 to copy inscriptions and drew a plan. He could not find any remains which indicated the name of the city, but he suspected that it was Marmara or Apollonia. Diodorus Siculus writes that Alexander the Great conquered a \\"great rock fortress\\" inhabited by the Marmares when he passed the frontier of Lycia. Spratt refers to the fortress with the name Marmora, others use Marmara. Apollonia was a Thracian colony in Lycia, which might explain why Thracians guided the second division of Alexander the Great's army through this remote part of Lycia. Marmara has now been found nearby, but Apollonia was eventually discovered far away in western Lycia. Later in 1842 the site was visited by A. J. Sch√∂nborn, who also proposed an identification as Marmara based on the description of Diodorus. A 1998 study of coins in the Antalya Museum led to the identification of the name of Kitanaura. The name of the city also appeared on a Roman milestone, the Miliarium Lyciae which was excavated at Patara in 1993. The inscriptions on the milestone give place names and distances during the 1st century AD. They mention Kitanaura lay at a distance of 17-18 kilometers to Idebessos. This made it possible to pinpoint the location of the city. Kitanaura was surveyed in detail by a team from Akdeniz University led by Nevzat √áevik in 2004‚Äì2005 and 2006‚Äì2007. Layout The acropolis of Kitanaura was located on a hill extending in an east-west direction and surrounded by remains of structures to its south and west. The western and northern sides of the acropolis are covered by sheer rock cliffs, a less steeper rock slope is on southern side. Walls for the protection of the acropolis extended from the southwestern side to the eastern and northern side of the acropolis. They were 1.30 meters thick and have been preserved to a height of 5 to 6 meters at a few places. Remains of a basilica are found in the southwestern corner of the acropolis. Another large basilica stood in the center. A bath-gymnasium complex is the only building at the settlement which was reasonably well-preserved. It is located at the foot of the southwestern entrance to the acropolis and consisted of a palaestra and six other sections. A road which runs from the south of the acropolis and then turns north, passing the acropolis to west, is flanked by necropoleis on both sides. A heroon is found south of the acropolis. The quality of the construction and the size of the baths is striking for a medium-sized city in a relatively remote place in Lycia. With a size of 700 square meters the building is over twice the size of the central baths of Patara (315 m) and the southern baths of Xanthos (295 m), two of the largest cities in Lycia. The sizes of baths were influenced by both the population of a city and the number of occasional visitors from outside the city. The location of the baths at a crossroads of routes used by travelers suggests the baths served many temporary visitors.

Born after the deposition of her brother Ivan VI, she was kept imprisoned by Empress Elizabeth of Russia along with her family at Kholmogory, and in 1780, she and two brothers and a sister were placed under house arrest for the rest of their lives in Horsens. Early life The siblings were kept prisoner because their right to the Russian throne, according to the succession of Empress Anna, made them potential political threats to the Empress Elizabeth, Emperor Peter III, and eventually Empress Catherine the Great. In contrast to that of their elder brother, the deposed Ivan VI, who was placed in solitary confinement, the younger siblings were kept together with their father after the death of their mother in 1746. In Kholmogory, the family occupied the Bishop's house within the fortress compound, where they were allowed a small garden and some animals. They were kept under watch by guards and kept a small retinue of servants: as their father retained sexual relations with the female servants, their staff eventually consisted of their half siblings.Evgeniƒ≠ Viktorovich Anisimov: Five Empresses: Court Life in Eighteenth-century Russia (2004) By an Imperial decree of 1750, the siblings were banned from learning to read and write.Evgeniƒ≠ Viktorovich Anisimov: Five Empresses: Court Life in Eighteenth- century Russia (2004) Reign of Catherine the Great In 1766, their father was offered his freedom by Empress Catherine the Great, but he refused to leave without his children, and therefore remained with them until his death in 1776, by then blind. In 1780, Empress Catherine was arranging for their release and transfer to the custody of their paternal aunt, the Danish queen dowager Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel in Denmark. Before their release, they were brought to Archangelsk to be interviewed and inspected by Governor Aleksei Melgunov. Melgunov provided personal descriptions of each sibling in his report. He reported that all the four siblings were physically weak and suffered from poor health; Peter was lopsided and bow-legged and seemed consumptive; Aleksei was physically stronger but suffered from seizures; Catherine was thin and deaf and suffered from seizures, could lipread but had poor control over her voice.Evgeniƒ≠ Viktorovich Anisimov: Five Empresses: Court Life in Eighteenth-century Russia (2004) As for Elizabeth, she was described as plump, energetic, talkative and reliable, and also as the dominant personality and as the spokesperson of the family.Evgeniƒ≠ Viktorovich Anisimov: Five Empresses: Court Life in Eighteenth-century Russia (2004) While being physically weak, however, all four siblings were described as intelligent, likable and humane people, who had learned to read and write on their own despite the prohibition of the Imperial decree.Evgeniƒ≠ Viktorovich Anisimov: Five Empresses: Court Life in Eighteenth-century Russia (2004) They had reportedly a friendly relationship to each other, spending their days tending to the garden and their hens and ducks, riding, chasing each other on the frozen lake at winter, and playing chess and cards.Evgeniƒ≠ Viktorovich Anisimov: Five Empresses: Court Life in Eighteenth-century Russia (2004) Kovrov city council member Nikolay Frolov wrote that Elizabeth likely had a son with a guard sergeant named Ivan Trifonov.http://emir- sergei.livejournal.com/31987.html During the inspection of Melgonov, Elizabeth, described as the head of the family, communicated the siblings life and wishes.Evgeniƒ≠ Viktorovich Anisimov: Five Empresses: Court Life in Eighteenth-century Russia (2004) She stated that when young, before their father had grown blind, they had all wished to be free, and hoped for the day when they would be released.Evgeniƒ≠ Viktorovich Anisimov: Five Empresses: Court Life in Eighteenth-century Russia (2004) They had asked for permission to ride a sleigh through the streets, but never received a reply to any demand made.Evgeniƒ≠ Viktorovich Anisimov: Five Empresses: Court Life in Eighteenth- century Russia (2004) As for herself personally, she had wished to be educated about the manners of the grand world and participate in high society.Evgeniƒ≠ Viktorovich Anisimov: Five Empresses: Court Life in Eighteenth-century Russia (2004) Now, however, they had lived all their lives as prisoners and had grown to be content with their lives. They had only three wishes: first, that they wished to be allowed to visit a meadow, as they had heard that it contained flowers not to be found in their garden; second, that the wives of the officers should be allowed to visit them to provide company; and finally, they wished to learn how to be put on and wear the complicated upper-class garments they were provided with, such as the corsets, because neither they nor their servants knew how they should be put on or worn.Evgeniƒ≠ Viktorovich Anisimov: Five Empresses: Court Life in Eighteenth-century Russia (2004) If these three wishes were granted, she stated, they would all four be content to continue to live as before.Evgeniƒ≠ Viktorovich Anisimov: Five Empresses: Court Life in Eighteenth-century Russia (2004) Later life Before their release, the siblings were provided with new wardrobes and household- gifts from the Empress, so that Russia would make a good impression in Denmark. When told that they would be transferred to Denmark, they asked that they be housed in a remote place with few people there. While leaving Russia on ship on the 27 June 1780, the siblings reportedly started to cry upon seeing the fortress in Arkhangelsk, believing that they had been tricked and would be separated and each placed in solitary confinement.Evgeniƒ≠ Viktorovich Anisimov: Five Empresses: Court Life in Eighteenth-century Russia (2004) On 30 August 1780, the siblings arrived in Denmark.

The siblings were kept prisoner because their right to the Russian throne, according to the succession of Empress Anna, made them potential political threats to Empress Elizabeth, Emperor Peter III, and eventually Empress Catherine the Great. In contrast to their elder brother, the deposed Ivan VI, who was placed in solitary confinement, the younger siblings were kept together with their father after the death of their mother in 1746. In Kholmogory, the family occupied the Bishop's house within the fortress compound, where they were allowed a small garden and some animals. They were kept under watch by guards and kept a small retinue of servants. As their father had sexual relations with the female servants, their staff eventually consisted of their half siblings. By an imperial decree of 1750, the siblings were banned from learning to read and write. In 1766, their father was offered his freedom by Empress Catherine the Great, but he refused to leave without his children, and therefore remained with them until his death in 1776, by then blind. In 1780, Empress Catherine was arranging for their release and transfer to the custody of their paternal aunt, the Danish queen dowager Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel in Denmark. Before their release, they were brought to Archangelsk to be interviewed and inspected by Governor Aleksei Melgunov. Melgunov provided personal descriptions of each sibling in his report. He reported that all four siblings were physically weak and suffered from poor health. Peter was lopsided and bow-legged and seemed consumptive; Aleksei was physically stronger but suffered from seizures; Catherine was thin and deaf and suffered from seizures, could lipread but had poor control over her voice. As for Elizabeth, she was described as plump, energetic, talkative and reliable, and also as the dominant personality and spokesperson of the family. While physically weak, however, all four siblings were described as intelligent, likable and humane people, who had learned to read and write through their own devices despite the prohibition of the imperial decree. They reportedly had friendly relationships with each other, spending their days tending to the garden, their hens and ducks, riding, chasing each other on the frozen lake during winter, and playing chess and cards. During Melgonov's inspection, Elizabeth, described as the head of the family, communicated the siblings lives and wishes. She stated that when young, before their father had become blind, they had all wished to be free, and had hoped for the day when they would be released. They had asked for permission to ride a sleigh through the streets, but never received a reply to any request made. As for herself personally, she had wished to be educated about the manners of the outside world and to participate in high society. Later, however, after they had lived all their lives as prisoners, they had grown content with their lives. They had only three wishes: first, that they be allowed to visit a meadow, as they had heard that it contained flowers not to be found in their garden; second, that the wives of the officers should be allowed to visit them to provide company; and finally, that they be taught how to put on and wear the complicated upper-class garments they were provided with, such as corsets, because neither they nor their servants knew how they should be put on or worn. If these three wishes were granted, she stated, they would all be content to continue to live as before. Before their release, the siblings were provided with new wardrobes and household gifts from the empress, so that Russia would make a good impression in Denmark. When told that they would be transferred to Denmark, they asked that they be housed in a remote place with few people there. While leaving Russia on ship on the 27 June 1780, the siblings reportedly started to cry upon seeing the fortress in Arhangelsk, believing that they had been tricked and would be separated and each placed in solitary confinement. On 30 August 1780, the siblings arrived in Denmark. For bureaucratic reasons, however, they were forced to separate from their servants (and half siblings) upon their arrival. In Denmark, their aunt, Queen Dowager Juliana Maria, reportedly never visited them even once. They lived under house arrest in Horsens in Jutland under the guardianship of Juliana Maria and at the expense of Empress Catherine. Although they were prisoners, they lived in relative comfort and retained a small \\"court\\" of between 40 and 50 people, all Danish except for their Russian Orthodox priest.Marie Tetzlaff : Katarina den stora (1998) The siblings, being unused to their new degree of freedom in a new environment and surrounded by people whose language they could not understand, were reportedly unhappy in Denmark.

The monetary policy of China aims to keep the value of the RMB stable and contribute to economic growth. \\"The Law on the People's Bank of China (the PBOC) stipulates that the objective of monetary policy is to keep the value of RMB stable to contribute to economic growth.\\" The Formation of China's Steady Monetary Policy Richard C.K. Burdekin \\"What has driven Chinese monetary policy since 1990? Investigating the People‚Äôs bank‚Äôs policy rule\\" The steady monetary policy with Chinese characteristics came into being gradually after 1998. The so-called prudent monetary policy means its goal is to use currency stability as a goal, correctly handle the relationship between preventing financial risks and supporting economic growth, and maintain a moderate growth of money supply to support the sustained and rapid health of the national economy while improving the quality of loans. The background of the central government's steady monetary policy mainly includes the following aspects: First, after the real estate and development zone boom of the early 1990s, by 1997 and 1998, the risk of some small and medium-sized financial institutions has become quite prominent. At that time, the Chinese government and the People‚Äôs Bank of China Faced with the important task of resolving financial risks and preventing the emergence of new and more serious financial risks; Second, at the time, although the contradictions of insufficient total social demand have been exposed, the most prominent ones are structural problems, and the actual effective loan demand is insufficient; The long-term implementation of a financial system based on indirect financing of banks, high corporate debt management, and a low proportion of self-owned funds continue to significantly increase the number of loans, and the problem of non-performing loans will become more pronounced. Fourth, the implementation of a proactive fiscal policy will itself include the use of policies, the additional issuance of treasury bonds, and the participation of banks in purchases themselves include the use of monetary policy to support economic growth. The prudent monetary policy implemented since 1998 has achieved great success. Mainly in four aspects: First, the steady growth of total money and credit. From 1998 to 2001, the growth rate of broad money supply was basically controlled between 14% and 15%. Compared with the ups and downs of currencies and credits in the past years, we finally managed to regulate the growth of money and credit more smoothly. Second, the credit structure has been greatly adjusted. Driven by a series of credit policies, the ratio of personal housing loans, infrastructure loans, and agricultural loans has increased significantly. In the year of the new loans, the above three loans accounted for roughly 70% of the total. This adjustment of the credit structure has effectively promoted the nationals adjustment of economic structure. The third is to maintain domestic financial stability and the stability of the RMB exchange rate. In 1997, some small and medium-sized financial institutions began to have payment problems. In recent years, they used deflationary opportunities to increase refinancing, helped local governments to close down some small and medium-sized financial institutions, and maintained financial stability and social stability. RMB exchange rate stability not only in Asia to make a contribution to the economy and the world economy, also in line with our national interests, in recent years the balance of payments equilibrium, the state foreign exchange reserves continued to increase. The fourth is to basically realize the transition from direct regulation to indirect regulation of monetary policy. In 1998 cancellation of loan quota. In the past few years after the control, open market operations have actually become the main tool for the daily operation of monetary policy.

He selected Crown land at Mount Remarkable (now Melrose township), South Australia, grazing sheep until 1863, when he sold up to move to Queensland. With his brother John and overseer Frank Gardiner, he purchased 4000 sheep at Maitland, New South Wales, and drove them across New England via Quart Pot Creek (now Stanthorpe), Drayton, Dalby and Jinghi station to Mackay, thence to Mount Dryanda, Proserpine, where he settled on a property, but had hardly commenced operations, when Aboriginals killed one of the men and half of the sheep, so Yeates decided to abandon sheep for cattle, and moved to the Lynd River, selecting on Myall Downs. Later he sold that property, and in 1868 selected land on the Don River, near Bowen, where they resided until 1880, when he entered into partnership with J. F.

Formed by a royal edict during the reign of Louis XIV, the aimed to address the recurring problem of begging and the Cour des miracles, as well as to house invalids. The General Hospital's authority stretched beyond its premises to include all the poor in Paris. The hospital serves as a major point of analysis in philosopher Michel Foucault's seminal work, Madness and Civilization.  Founding  Like the other western European states, France dealt with an increase in mendicancy beginning in the sixteenth century. This increase fueled anxiety about maintaining social stability and motivated the creation of more severe penalties for begging, such as branding, whipping, and forced labor. In the years prior to the establishment of the General Hospital, the devastation of the Fronde resulted in a particularly large influx of beggars into Paris. The growing population of beggars was approximately 40,000 people, many of whom were refugees impoverished during the wars. This amount would have constituted roughly 10% of the Parisian population. To alleviate such destitution, in 1652 the Company of the Blessed Sacrament, an active French Catholic secret society, started relief efforts centered around the development of a charitable storehouse. However, after the wars' conclusion, the company decided to advocate for a policy of confinement, a more long-term solution to the city's poverty and mendicancy. The company had taken an interest in confining the Parisian poor ever since 1633, impressed by apparent successes of the first General Hospital in Lyon. However, this proposed solution also had precedents within the city itself. For instance, from 1612 to 1618, the H√¥pital des Pauvres Enferm√©s‚Äîan early attempt at building a Parisian general hospital‚Äîlocked up local beggars and subjected them to a system of forced labor. However, this effort was short-lived due to financial difficulties, political conflicts, and a sharp increase in the refugee population, among other challenges. Later on, in 1532, the Parliament of Paris again began to apprehend beggars, this time using them as forced laborers for the city sewers. Consequently, the idea of confinement had already been introduced when Christophe du Plessis-Montbard, a devoted member of the Company of the Blessed Sacrament, began to work with the Parliament in 1653 on developing plans for a new Parisian general hospital. Also instrumental in shaping these plans were Les Dames de la Charit√©, an organization of wealthy lay women led at the time by Marie Madeleine d‚ÄôAiguillon. The General Hospital of Paris was ultimately established three years later in 1656 by a royal edict of Louis XIV. The hospital was endowed not just with authority on its own premises, but also with jurisdiction over all the poor residents of the city. Michel Foucault identifies the founding of the Parisian General Hospital as a key moment in the continent-wide trend towards confining the poor. Similar establishments were founded during the same time period in modern-day Switzerland, United Kingdom, Poland, Germany, Russia, and Ireland.  Operations   Facilities  The Parisian General Hospital was structured as a consolidation of a number of existing institutions under shared mission and management. These establishments initially included the Maison de Saint-Louis de Salp√™tri√®re, Maison de Saint- Jean de Bic√™tre, Notre Dame de La Piti√©, La Savonnerie, and Scipion. However, Maison du Saint-Esprit and the Enfants-Trouv√©s were soon added and Savonnerie dropped. In 1670, a royal edict also added the Foundling Hospital, to house abandoned children. By 1680, the General Hospital had expanded to encompass a total of nine different institutions. Many of the hospital's constituent institutions had previously served as charities for different indigent groups. Although the General Hospital was not a medical facility, a resident physician was hired to make regular visits to the various constituent institutions. Eventually, beginning in 1780, physician Jean Colombier began to introduce a substantial expansion to the hospital's medical apparatus in his capacity as the royally-appointed inspector of hospitals and prisons. He created facilities staffed with medical personnel at Salp√™tri√®re and Bic√™tre. Beginning at an earlier time, the General Hospital also contributed to medical research by a confidential arrangement whereby dead prisoners from Salp√™tri√®re could by used by researchers at the Royal Garden of the Medicinal Plants as cadavers (French: Jardin royal des plantes m√©dicinales).  Management  Although the project of the General Hospital had been developed by the Parliament, in practice the hospital was much more closely tied with royal power. The Company of the Blessed Sacrament was also instrumental in the running of the General Hospital: twelve out of the twenty-six directors for life appointed by a May 4, 1656 royal edict were members of the company. The administrative board was shared with the H√¥tel-Dieu, Paris' other major hospital. The board's membership consisted of key governmental figures ranging from the President of the Parliament and the Archbishop of Paris to the Lieutenant General of Police. Beneath this board was another committee (specifically for the General Hospital) consisting of layman. The hospital's day-to-day oversight, however, was undertaken by Les Dames de la Charit√© through a lay sisterhood headed by Marie Bonneau de Rubelle, Mme de Miramion. After the French Revolution begun, a December 1789 decree of the National Contstituent Assembly charged relevant governmental departments with the oversight of Parisian hospitals, charitable houses, prisons, and related institutions, consolidating their administrations under a single authority. In April 1791, the Paris hospitals (including the General Hospital) were all placed under the management of a five-member committee, abolishing their individual administrations.  Financing  It was initially decided that the hospital would be financed in large part by donations. This budgeting structure would later cause financial problems during the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries, as the hospital's increasing population of inmates generated increasing expenses. This reliance on donations also meant that the hospital's policies were sometimes shaped by the will of its donors, especially in areas of religion. For example, during the institution's founding, the Les Dames de la Charit√© threatened to withhold their donations unless members of the Daughters of Charity (French: Filles de la Charit√©) were guaranteed placements at the hospital. Even though the founding committee was opposed to involving religious orders in the hospital's administration, ultimately the Daughters of Charity received their positions. Another notable source of funding was various fines and taxes, many of which were established as revenue streams from the time of the hospital's founding. For instance, until the revolution an octroi tax on wine and liquors generated substantial revenues for the General Hospital and the Foundling Hospital (whose finances were kept separate from the rest of the General Hospital). Revenues raised from fines on rule violations at the Parisian bourse also contributed to the hospital's funding. Another financing challenge originated in the fact that‚Äîunlike French general hospitals‚Äîthe Parisian General Hospital was obligated to confine many \\"foreign\\" inmates who were not from the city itself. For example, after a 1662 famine, the hospital was forced to double its debt to accommodate the expenses associated with the increase of inmates from the surrounding area. In order to save money, these nearby towns and cities were sending their indigent residents to their capital. To help reduce strain on the capital, a royal edict was issued instructing all French towns and villages to create their own general hospitals. In 1676, a similar edict aimed at all cities and large towns was issued. The administrative re-structuring after the French Revolution eliminated some of the hospital's important revenue streams, beginning a period of financial decline.  Population  Incarceration began on Monday, May 14, 1657, when the militia‚Äîpopularly referred to as the \\"archers of the poor\\"‚Äîbegan arresting beggars and delivering them to the General Hospital. By its first year, the Hospital General held 6,000 poor, which made up around one percent of the population. Most of its inhabitants were voluntary inmates such as orphaned children, the elderly, or the sick. Even these voluntary inmates, however, were subject to a level of coercion. As for involuntary inmates, the hospital only had room to confine a few hundred particularly persistent beggars. This would become a lasting trend in the hospital's demographics: even though one of the hospital's primary aims was to imprison pauvres valides‚Äîimmoral or mendicant poor people nonetheless capable of work‚Äîmost of its space would be used to house pauvres invalides‚Äîthose too old, young, or sick to support themselves. Most of the pauvres valides were housed at Salp√™tri√®re and Bic√™tre, although eventually these areas for criminals were done away with: in 1795 at the former institution, and in 1836 at the latter. There was also a small number of political prisoners held at the hospital. By the early eighteenth century, the population of the General Hospital usually numbered around 8,000 to 9,000 people. By the latter half of that century, the population had grown substantially: in 1786, the hospital's constituent institutions held 12,000 individuals, and oversaw an additional 15,000 foundlings not housed within its walls. Salp√™tri√®re housed 1,460 a population of women and young children four years after the hospital's founding. Over time the population significantly increased, with a census from May 1713 counting a population of 4,079 inmates. This population was around 80% pauvres invalides such as children, insane women, elderly married couples, mothers, pregnant women, and sick women. Around 20% were pauvres valides such as female beggars or vagrants. Before the revolution, Salp√™tri√®re's population had grown to 10,000, divided among fifteen separate buildings including prisons for criminals and prostitutes, a madhouse, a girl's reformatory, and a poorhouse. Bic√™tre held 1,313 inmates at the time of the May 1713 census. The division was similar to that of Salp√™tri√®re: 74% of inmates were pauvres invalides such as physically or mentally disabled men, blind beggars, and sufferers of syphillis; 26% were pauvres valides such as male beggars, criminals, and vagrants. Children also composed a significant portion of the hospital's population, even apart from the 15,000 foundlings housed outside of it. By 1786, four of the hospital's institutions were populated entirely by orphans and foundlings. Beginning in 1680, disobedient or licentious children were also sent by their parents to live in reformaries at Salp√™tri√®re and Bic√™tre.  Operations  Seeing as the General Hospital had authority over all the poor of Paris, the hospital‚Äôs directors were endowed with punitive powers paralleling the courts: according to the founding edict, directors had the power to utilize ‚Äústakes, irons, prisons, and dungeons in the said H√¥pital G√©n√©ral and the places thereto appertaining so much as they deem necessary, no appeal will be accepted from the regulations they establish within the said hospital.‚Äù Within the General Hospital, the daily lives of the poor were meticulously regulated. There was a dress code of assigned grey robes and caps, and their daily routines of work, prayer, and meals were tightly scheduled. By the eighteenth century, the General Hospital employed a permanent staff of roughly five hundred. Although everyday life was orderly, living conditions could be unsanitary. A 1790 committee from the National Constituent Assembly found Salp√™tri√®re and Piti√© to be overcrowded and foul-smelling, with many inmates suffering from conditions such as ringworm and itch. Work was a key component of everyday life at the General Hospital for both punitive and reformative reasons. Inmates were made to labor in workshops, participating in tasks such as knitting, spinning, and weaving. Refusal to work resulted in physically intensive labor assignments at Bic√™tre. This system did not bring economic benefits to the institution; on the contrary, it was a major expense undertaken for the sake of moral instruction and reform. However, the administration of the General Hospital unsuccessfully tried on many occasions to make the establishment more profitable by turning buildings such as Piti√© and Bic√™tre into factories for tasks such as lace manufacturing and mirror polishing. The young foundlings living outside of the hospital's walls worked as well, many of them living on farms in rural areas. Once they got older, they either continued with farm work or returned to the hospital until adulthood. If they returned, girls would learn housekeeping skills and boys would be afforded apprenticeships with Paris' guilds and corporations, an arrangement dating from the hospital's founding. By the eighteenth century, however, the workshops were in decline.

After the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed on 27 July 1953, most of the Busan port facilities were turned over to the ROK government. Since the Korean War, Camp Hialeah was organised under different commands and missions. They included the 8069th Replacement Depot, the Korean Communications Zone, Busan Military Post, Busan Sub Area Command, Busan Area Command, Busan Base Command, 2nd Transportations Group, Busan Support Activity, U.S. Army Garrison-Busan, 34th and 20th Support Groups and 19th Theater Area Command, Area IV, 20th Area Support Group. Camp Hialeah was a primary receiving point for materiel, equipment, supplies and goods to U.S. Army bases in the Republic of Korea and was one of the primary Non-combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) routes for U.S. personnel in and out of the Republic of Korea. Camp Hialeah supported tenant units that included the Busan Storage Facility, the largest (cold) storage facility within U.S. Forces Korea for supplies and goods to commissaries and exchanges Korea-wide, the 61st Chemical Company, the 552nd Military Police Company and the 4th Quartermaster Detachment (Airborne). Other tenant activities supported by Camp Hialeah included personnel of Air Force units at the Combat Ready Contingency Hospital, 25th Transportation Battalion; the Communications unit and the AMC Terminal at Gimhae Air Base; the 837th Transport Battalion; Transportation Motor Pool; Defense Contract Management Command-Gimhae; Military Sealift Command Operations, US Navy; 74th Signal Company; Defense Reutilization Management Operations; Chejudo Recreation Center; 72nd Ordnance Company; C. Company, 168th Medical Battalion; 106th Medical Detachment; Criminal Investigations Division; Navy Office of Special Investigations; USAF Office of Special Investigations; 665th Medical (Dental) Detachment; 524th Military Intelligence Battalion; 1st Signal Brigade; and the 154th Medical Detachment. At its peak, the Camp and its associated facilities had a population of 2,500 U.S. military and Department of Defense civilian employees.  Return to Busan Government  Originally, the Camp was distant from residential areas, but as the city of Busan grew it eventually surrounded the Camp. Under the guidelines of the U.S.‚ÄìSouth Korea Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), comparable facilities that comply with U.S. standards and infrastructure are required to ensure quality of life for U.S. soldiers and families prior to installation relocation. On 1 June 2005, pursuant to the Amended Land Partnership Plan between the U.S. and the Republic of Korea, it was announced that Camp Hialeah would close. The last units to leave the installation were the 72nd Ordnance Company and 6th Korean Service Corps Company, which were reassigned on the Korean Peninsula; while the 552nd Military Police Company, 4th Quartermaster Detachment (Airborne) and the 61st Chemical Company relocated to Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, Alaska and Fort Lewis, Washington, respectively. On 10 August 2006 Camp Hialeah was formally returned to Busan Metropolitan City. The US and South Korean governments disagreed over the issue of environmental cleanup of the Camp and this delayed its redevelopment by 4 years until it was agreed that South Korea would meet the cleanup costs. The Camp was open to the public from 24 April to 30 September, 2010 before closing for redevelopment.  Busan Citizens Park  The site was redeveloped as Busan Citizens Park with 5 themes and 29 separate attractions. The Park opening was delayed due to the discovery of environmental contamination in 3 areas of the site. The Park was opened to the public on 1 May 2014. Several of the Park buildings are refurbished military base buildings including several Quonset huts.

Itamar Alon, an Israeli citizen, entered into the bank and opened fire, killing four and wounding five. He then took a woman hostage and killed himself when police arrived. Background The shooter, Itamar Alon, was a 39 year old Beersheba resident. He had done his mandatory military service in the Israel Defense Forces in the Combat Engineering Corps, and he rose to become an officer. He later transferred to the Israel Border Police, and participated in joint patrols with Palestinian police in the Tulkarm area. After completing his active service, he began working as a security guard for educational institutions and the Beersheba municipality, and served as a platoon commander in a reserve battalion. In 2002, he was caught in a shooting attack by two Palestinian militants in which two Israeli soldiers were killed, and killed one of the militants with his pistol. He was awarded a medal by Beersheba mayor Yaakov Turner. That same year, he was fired by the municipality at the end of his trial period of employment due to poor relations with co-workers. He was also transferred from his position as a reserve platoon commander to command a rearguard battalion in the IDF Home Front Command due to aggressive behavior and poor judgement. In 2011, the Israel Police requested that Alon be stripped of his private gun license after he had been involved in a dispute with his neighbors and suspicions over him committing violence against his parents had emerged. After a court hearing, Alon was allowed to keep his gun license. In May 2013, Alon's credit card was cancelled after he had accumulated a debt of about NIS 6,000, and the card was swallowed by an ATM when he tried to use it. On May 23, 2013, he visited the Bank Hapoalim branch in the Neve Ze'ev neighborhood of Beersheba requesting a debt settlement, and was refused. A few hours later, he returned to commit the shooting. The shooting At around 1:00 p.m., Alon returned to the Bank Hapoalim branch armed with a .45-caliber Glock 21 semiautomatic pistol and sat down together with other people waiting for services. He then got up and opened fire. The branch's manager, Avner Cohen and his deputy Meir Zeitun were killed, as were two customers, Idan Sabri and Anat Even-Haim. According to eyewitness accounts, Alon shot the two bank employees who were shot multiple times to ensure that they were dead. Five other people were wounded. Alon then took a woman, Miri Cohen, an employee of the bank, as a hostage, and barricaded himself with her in a bathroom. Within three minutes of the start of the shooting, the police arrived, with one policeman shooting a flowerpot as a deterrent as officers entered, and began searching for the shooter. One of the wounded victims was temporarily handcuffed after being mistaken for the shooter by police. After it became known that the shooter was in a bathroom together with a hostage, a police officer fired a single shot into the bathroom.https://www.makorrishon.co.il/nrg/online/1/ART2/471/906.html The police negotiated with Alon until he shot himself. He was taken to Soroka Medical Center, where he died. Police officials stated that there was no security guard at the bank at the time of the incident.Controlling guns, The Jerusalem Post (May 21, 2013) Reactions Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the shooting \\"a terrible tragedy\\". He said he does not remember such an event and that it is a phenomenon that is not common in Israel.

However, as her brother was given home tuition in preparation for university studies, and she is confirmed to have socialized with the students of her father, who were also tutored in the family home, it is seen as likely that she was given home tuition by the same teachers as her brother and her father's students, perhaps also with them, which was not uncommon in Sweden at the time. She was acquainted with several of her father's students, among them Erik Gustaf Lidbeck and Daniel Solander, the latter of whom she reportedly wished to marry, but as he did not return from his expedition, the marriage never took place. Linn√© married major Carl Fredrik Bergencrantz in 1764 and had two children. However, she left her husband and moved back with her parents a couple of years after her wedding because she had been subjected to spousal abuse: she died at the age of 39, and her children also died before adulthood. Her mother blamed her early death upon the abuse she had been subjected to while married.Manktelow, Mariette; Kettunen, Petronella (2007). Kvinnorna kring Linn√©.

History of the Tigri Area territorial dispute The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 set the border between British Guiana and Suriname as the Courantyne River. The treaty was signed and ratified by both parties. Robert Schomburgk surveyed British Guiana's borders in 1840. Taking the Courantyne River as the border, he sailed up to which he deemed its source, the Kutari River, in order to delineate the boundary. In 1871, however, Charles Barrington Brown discovered the New River or Upper Corentyne, which is the source of the Corentyne River. Thus the Tigri Area or New River Triangle dispute was born. The tribunal which dealt with the Venezuela Crisis of 1895 also illegally awarded the New River Triangle to British Guiana. The Netherlands, however, raised a diplomatic protest, claiming that the New River, and not the Kutari, was to be regarded as the source of the Corentyne and the boundary. The British government in 1900 replied that the issue was already settled by the long acceptance of the Kutari as the boundary. In 1936, a Mixed Commission established by the British and Dutch government agreed to award the full width of the Corentyne River to Suriname, as per the 1799 agreement. The territorial sea boundary was deemed to prolongate 10¬∞ from Point No. 61, from the shore. The New River Triangle, however, was completely awarded to Guyana. The treaty putting this agreement into law was never ratified, because of the outbreak of World War II. The Dutch representative Conrad Carel K√§yser signed an agreement with British and Brazilian representatives, placing the tri-point junction near the source of the Kutari River. Desiring to put the border issue to a closure before British Guiana would gain independence, the British government restarted negotiations in 1961. The British position asserted \\"Dutch sovereignty over the Corentyne River, a 10¬∞ line dividing the territorial sea, and British control over the New River Triangle.\\" The Netherlands replied with a formal claim to the New River Triangle, but with a thalweg boundary in the Corentyne River (the latter position has never been repeated by any Surinamese government). No agreements were made and Guyana became independent with its borders unresolved. In the present village of Kuruni near the Coeroenie Airstrip prefab houses were placed for workers on a planned weir. On 12 December 1967, four armed men of the Guyana police force landed, and ordered the workers to leave the area. Four military posts were initially established by the Surinamese army, however mainly for financial reasons, only Camp Tigri (also known as Camp Jaguar) remained. On 19 August 1969, border skirmishes occurred between Guyanese forces and Surinamese militias at Camp Tigri which was subsequently conquered by Guyana. On 18 March 1970, Prime-minister Eric Williams of Trinidad and Tobago offered to mediate the conflict. In November 1970 the Surinamese and Guyanese governments agreed in Trinidad and Tobago to withdraw their military forces from the Triangle. In 1975 Suriname became independent. Just prior to independence President Henck Arron of Suriname asked Prime-minister Joop den Uyl of the Netherlands for a precise definition of the borders. The reply included the Tigri area. Until present Guyana has not held upon this agreement and withdrawn any of its military forces but still holds a firm grip on the New River Triangle or mineral rich Tigri Area.https://atlantablackstar.com/2014/05/12/suriname-guyana-dispute-mineral- rich-lands/https://www.waterkant.net/suriname/2011/06/08/bouterse-tigri- gebied-is-en-blijft-van- suriname/https://bchamchandralall.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/is-tigri-wel-van- suriname/ Villages The indigenous villages of Kasuela and Sakuru of the Tiriy√≥ tribe are located inside the Tigri area. Kasuela is the oldest village of Western Trio Group and is located on an island in the middle of the New River. The village is also known as Casuela, Kasuelen and Cashew Island. Camp Tigri known in Guyana as Camp Jaguar, is located to the north of the village. The village of Sakuru was founded in 2008 by a group of people from Kwamalasamutu.

They refer to their music, which incorporates elements of garage rock, pop and rhythm and blues as \\"Socialist RnB\\". Their album Up The Workers! was rated one of the Daily Mirrors top twenty albums of 2011.  Biography  Thee Faction's debut album At Ebbw Vale was released in 2010. Dubbed 'rhythm and booze' and 'timely' by Simon Price in The Independent it was rated 8/10 in Vive Le Rock. Is This Music? praised the record, comparing the band to Dr. Feelgood. Second album Up The Workers! or, Capitalism is Good For Corporations That's Why You've Been Told Socialism is Bad All Your Life was described by the Daily Mirror as \\"Power-packed garage rock 'n' soul underlined by a defiantly political edge.\\" The title track featured Ivan Chandler (The Echoes) on piano. The album was rated 7/10 by Drowned in Sound who praised it as \\"a lot of fun, undeniably stirring.. Thee Faction write showstoppers\\" but also criticised the music as \\"entertaining in a very conventional way\\". The band's third album Singing Down The Government, or, The War of Position and How We're Winning It, was released in 2012, and introduced all-female horn section Brass Kapital. The album was promoted by headlining appearances at the Marxism Festival and Tolpuddle Martyrs festival and included contributions by Richard Archer from Hard-Fi and rapper Clencha. Free download-only singles for tracks 'Soapbox' and 'Sausage Machine' were accompanied by promotional videos. Q Magazine praised the album as \\"a critique of societal hegemony on the back of a grimy blues'n‚Äôb twang, rife with the contagious energy of people who know they're right\\", and it was rated 7/10 by Mick Farren in Classic Rock Blues magazine. Thee Faction released fourth album Good Politics: Your Role As An Active Citizen Within Civil Society in 2013, preceded by single 'Better Than Wages', remixed from the album by Andy Lewis. The album featured (on one track each) guest vocals from writer Francis Wheen and saxophone from Crayola Lectern, and was rated 8/10 in Classic Rock and 4/5 in The Independent and Mojo who called it \\"wildly galvanising, blisteringly angry, insanely entertaining blue-collar rock'n'roll\\".

Thee Faction released fifth album Reading Writing Revolution: The Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall in June 2015, preceded by a track on double-CD fundraising album Orgreave Justice and free download single \\"Choose Your Enemy\\", released on 29 March with accompanying video. A second free download single \\"(You've Got The) Numbers (Why Don't You Use It)\\" accompanied the release. The album received 5/5 in the Morning Star, 9/10 at MaximumVolumeMusic, and a positive review in Socialist Standard, while R*E*P*E*A*T zine called it \\"highly enjoyable, dangerously tuneful, subversively catchy and dialectically danceable, as well as being (as the title implies) properly educational - thought provoking and agitational.\\" The band announced a number of summer festival dates, including Glastonbury, and a return to Tolpuddle and the Matchwomens Festival. Thee Faction guitarist Babyface, under cadre name \\"Chris Fox\\", won the Beard Liberation Front's 'St David's Day Beard of Wales' title in 2015, 2017 and 2018. He was runner-up in 2016. Thee Faction's most recent gig to date was a 2017 benefit show for the anti-Haringey Development Vehicle campaign. The band has not officially confirmed a hiatus, although a slogan on one of their web-pages, \\"R&B; sui generis\\", may indicate that, like other left-wing groups, they have gone into the Labour Party. Politics The band have performed with, and for, various artists and organisations of the broad Left including Attila the Stockbroker, Robb Johnson, Chris T-T, Grace Petrie, Colour Me Wednesday, The Tuts, Billy Bragg, TV Smith, The Hurriers, Mark Steel, Josie Long, the SWP, the Welsh Communist Party and the Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party leadership campaign. The band appear to be unaligned with any particular organisation or tradition but are noted for promoting ideas associated with guild socialism, democratic socialism, classical Marxism and left communism, while supporting a range of left-wing and trade union causes. Notwithstanding the band's use of Ostalgic tropes and apparent (possibly parodic) anti-revisionism, in a 2013 interview they declared themselves \\"libertarian socialists of one kind or another\\". Thee Faction have however attracted criticism for their political views; notably, a 2012 gig review by Ruth Dudley Edwards for The Daily Telegraph angered the newspaper's Conservative readership.

Such portraits were an expressionist development of the fragmented forms of his earlier Cubist works. A 1941 Picasso of Maar entitled Dora Maar au Chat sold at auction for $95,216,000 in 2006. Lichtenstein specifically used the 1939-40 portrait of Maar in the Morton G. Neumann Family Collection as the template for Woman with Flowered Hat.Fitzgerald, Michael, Picasso and American Art, Whitney Museum of American Art with Yale University Press, 2007, pp.253-4. Neumann himself had sent a reproduction of the portrait to Lichtenstein after seeing one of Lichtenstein's earlier reworkings of a Picasso painting. Lichtenstein painted Woman with Flowered Hat when he was pastiching various types of sources, including commercial illustrations, comic imagery and modernist masterpieces. The masterpieces represented what could have been dubbed the \\"canon\\" of art and was thought of as \\"high art,\\" while the \\"low-art\\" subject matter included comic strip images. His masterworks sources included the likes of C√©zanne, Mondrian and Picasso. During this time in his career, Lichtenstein noted that \\"the things that I have apparently parodied I actually admire.\\" The painting is one of four variations on Picassos that Lichtenstein created during 1962 and 1963. Creation Lichtenstein worked by creating a small-scale line- drawing based on the Picasso reproduction. He then projected the drawing onto the canvas, using the projected outline-drawing as a template. The artist deliberately avoided the easier option of projecting the reproduction itself. According to art scholar Michael Fitzgerald, this was because he wanted to be \\"true to his discipline of drawing\\". Lichtenstein attached the reproduction to the wall of his studio next to the painting as he worked on it. A photograph of the artist with the work in progress can be seen in an article on Lichtenstein that appeared in Life magazine at the time.\\"Is he the Worst Artist in the US?\\", Life, Jan 31, 1964. Such evidence makes Woman with Flowered Hat \\"the most thoroughly documented of his variations after Picasso\\". Discussing the painting with Richard Brown Baker, Lichtenstein commented, > There are some changes in this from the Picasso, obviously complete changes > all over, but the more obvious ones: I've changed the face-color to the pink > dots and the hair-color to the yellow, since all my girls have yellow hair, > almost all of them do. And I was curious to see what it would look like with > a more pseudo-realistic color, sort of correcting Picasso, as though he had > made an error in painting the face blue. And one of the purposes of it is to > make what looks like an insensitive reproduction of the Picasso, and > changing the color of the face and hair to ones that would be more > conventional would be part of that insensitivity, and there is a general > change in the shape of the whole position of the head.Richard Brown Baker, > \\"Interview with Roy Lichtenstein\\", November 15 and December 6 1963, > transcript quoted in Fitzgerald. Auction record On May 15, 2013, the painting sold for $56.1 million, including fees, at Christie's. It was bought by jeweller Laurence Graff who said: \\"It's a masterpiece and when you see a major one like this come up for sale, you only get one chance to get it...Plus, I've got a big birthday coming up.\\" Graff, whose 75th birthday is on June 13, outbid three telephone bidders with a winning bid of $50 million and auction fees that brought the total to $56.1 million. The auction, which was expected to exceed $30 million, coincided with the Lichtenstein retrospective being held at the Tate Modern. The retrospective had visited The Art Institute of Chicago from May 16 to September 3, 2012 and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. from October 14, 2012 to January 13, 2013 before its February 21 to May 27 run at the Tate Modern and finale at The Centre Pompidou from July 3 to November 4, 2013. On May 9, 2012, the painting Sleeping Girl (1964) from the collection of Beatrice and Phillip Gersh had established the previous Lichtenstein record $44.8 million at Sotheby's.

There are only a few things that he remembers ‚Äì his name, that he is originally from Paris and furthermore that he might have committed the murder of a woman named Rhea Wagner (Gemma Atkinson). He wants to know who he really is and he keeps repeating the same question to different characters. The answers are finally revealed. He starts getting flashbacks and remembers the identity of a woman identifying herself as Kavya (Gauahar Khan) who keeps reappearing in his hallucinations along with Rhea. She then starts stalking him. Kavya's role in Armin's life is quite hazy but eventually the truth is revealed as to why she is too close to Armin. Things become interesting when Armin meets Rhea, and remembers that he is Karan who is a writer and all the clips that he sees are the hidden shades of the writer himself. After losing the memory of Karan, the writer, he adopted the memory of Armin who used to work as a contract killer in his book. He is shown to be very smooth with the ladies and is also very quick with a gun. He also finds out that the woman named Kavya is none other than his wife Pooja. When Pooja finds out that Karan has lost his memory, she introduces herself with a fake identity to regain her husband as they were going through a rough patch in their marriage. She ends up killing a woman named Grace Soni (Ankita Makwana), who is revealed to be Karan's girlfriend.

Career Bonthron studied at Princeton University. In 1933, his junior year, Bonthron was IC4A champion at both 800 meters and 1500 meters and then set an American record in a Princeton mile race against New Zealand's Jack Lovelock. Bonthron led most of the way and attempted to pull away in the final backstretch, only to be overhauled by Lovelock, who ran the last lap in 58.9 seconds to set a new world record of 4:07.6. Bonthron finished seven yards back in 4:08.7, also under Jules Ladoum√®gue's old world mark. In February 1934 Bonthron defeated 1932 and 1933 NCAA champion Glenn Cunningham in an indoor meet in New York by several inches. On June 16 Bonthron was again on the losing end of a mile world record, as Cunningham beat him in the Princeton Invitational Mile in 4:06.7. However, Bonthron came back to beat Cunningham at the NCAA championships on June 23 in a new meeting record time of 4:08.9. A week later at the national championships in Milwaukee, Bonthron defeated Cunningham again.

Leading a unit composed primarily of Tennessee loyalists, he participated in early battles in the Cumberland Gap area before marching with the Army of the Cumberland at Stones River and Chickamauga. He later provided support for the Knoxville Campaign. An ardent Southern Unionist, Spears was appointed vice president of the 1861 East Tennessee Convention, which sought to form a separate, Union-aligned state in East Tennessee. He opposed the abolition of slavery, however, and was dismissed from the Army in 1864 for speaking out against the Emancipation Proclamation. Early life Spears was born in Bledsoe County, Tennessee, the eldest of five children of John Holliday Spears, a doctor, and his wife, Sarah (Gallant) Spears.National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution Lineage Book, Vol. 42 (1916), p. 47.Oliver Perry Temple, Mary Boyce Temple (ed.), \\"General James G. Spears,\\" Notable Men of Tennessee (Cosmopolitan Press, 1912), pp. 186-190. As a child, his family struggled financially after his father lost much of the family's estate through speculation. Fond of reading, Spears managed to educate himself, and eventually studied law. In 1848, Spears was elected clerk of the state circuit court. By 1851, he had acquired a large farm and several slaves, located on the outskirts of Pikeville. In 1860, he was among the commissioners appointed by the state to oversee construction of a turnpike connecting Pikeville and Jasper.Public Acts of the State of Tennessee Passed at the General Assembly (Griffith, Camp and Company, 1860), p. 216. On the eve of the Civil War, Spears opposed secession. A Democrat, he supported the Northern Democratic candidate Stephen Douglas in the 1860 presidential election. Spears represented Bledsoe County at both the Knoxville and Greeneville sessions of the 1861 East Tennessee Convention, and was appointed the convention's vice president. Described by fellow delegate Oliver Perry Temple as \\"hot-headed, impulsive, and obstinate in what he thought was right,\\" Spears supported the convention's original petition, which demanded the state legislature allow East Tennessee to form a separate, Union- aligned state, and threatened to use force if necessary. He was joined in this view by convention president T.A.R. Nelson and volatile ex-Congressman Thomas D. Arnold. This petition was rejected in favor of a less-threatening petition authored by Temple, which called for a new state in East Tennessee, but removed the threat of force. Civil War Disappointed with the Convention's peaceful final petition, Spears returned to his home in Bledsoe County, planning to take no part in the upcoming war. In the Fall of 1861, however, he learned that the state's Confederate authorities had issued a warrant for his arrest on grounds of disloyalty. Spears managed to flee to Kentucky, where he linked up with Tennessee Unionist refugees. He organized the 1st Tennessee Infantry Regiment, and was given the rank of lieutenant colonel in September 1861. The First Tennessee took part in the Battle of Camp Wildcat in late 1861 and the Battle of Mill Springs in early 1862.Ezra Warner, \\"James Gallant Spears,\\" Generals in Blue: Lives of the Union Commanders (LSU Press, 1964), pp. 466-467. Spears was promoted to brigadier general on March 5, 1862. He was placed in command of the 25th Brigade of the Army of the Ohio. In June 1862, the 25th participated in General George W. Morgan's capture of the Cumberland Gap, a key mountain pass located at the junction of Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia. In August, Spears led a sortie into Tennessee, and scattered a small Confederate contingent at Wallace's Crossroads (near modern LaFollette). Senator Andrew Johnson had suggested Spears be appointed commander of forces around Cumberland Gap,Hans L. Trefousse, Andrew Johnson: A Biography (W.W. Norton and Company, 1989), p. 409n. but Union generals were concerned that the hot-tempered Spears would seek violent retribution against East Tennessee Confederates. General Morgan wrote that Spears had \\"great energy and courage, but has an idea that war means extermination.\\"William Garrett Piston, \\"Carter's Raid,\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 49 (1977), p. 71. In October 1862, Spears and the 25th Brigade were placed under the newly organized Army of the Cumberland, which was commanded by General William S. Rosecrans. Rosecrans marched south to Nashville before turning eastward in pursuit of Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee. In late December, the two armies met at the Battle of Stones River near Murfreesboro. As the two armies fought, Spears guided 303 wagons packed with badly-needed provisions over muddy roads from Nashville to the frontline, and afterward helped capture a strategic patch of woods known as the \\"Round Forest\\" to aid the Union Army's victory.Larry J. Daniel, Days of Glory: The Army of the Cumberland, 1861-1865 (LSU Press, 2006). By the spring of 1863, a number of officers under Spears had grown tired of his \\"tyranny and ungentlemanly conduct,\\" and accused him of incompetence. Spears was court-martialed, and his brigade was moved to General Gordon Granger's Reserve Corps and placed under the temporary command of General George Crook. Spears was acquitted, however, and his command was restored.R.H. Groves, Blooding the Regiment: An Account of the 22nd Wisconsin's Long and Difficult Apprenticeship (Scarecrow Press, 2005), p. 218. Upon his return to his unit in August, he ruthlessly reasserted his authority, and threatened to arrest any officer who attempted to resign. In September, twenty-seven officers under his command signed a petition to Rosecrans demanding Spears's removal.The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies (U.S. Government Printing Office, 1890), p. 330. At the opening of the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863, Spears's unit occupied Lookout Mountain, overlooking Chattanooga. He was attacked by a Confederate force led by Nathan B. Forrest, but was ordered by Rosecrans to abandon the mountain rather than risk capture. In December 1863, Spears led his brigade north as part of an expedition to relieve Union-occupied Knoxville, which had been placed under siege by General James Longstreet. Spears scattered a small Confederate contingent led by John R. Hart near Kingston, and captured six guns abandoned by Hart at Loudon.Earl J. Hess, The Knoxville Campaign: Burnside and Longstreet in East Tennessee (University of Tennessee Press, 2012), p. 198. Spears staunchly opposed President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, and angrily spoke out against it. He allegedly stated, \\"God damn the Government; let her go to hell, and I'll be found in the ranks fighting her.\\"Joseph Allan Frank, With Ballot and Bayonet: The Political Socialization of American Civil War Soldiers (University of Georgia Press, 1998), p. 136. He was arrested for these statements in February 1864, and subsequently court-martialed. While Spears admitted he disagreed with the Proclamation, he denied making disloyal statements. He was nevertheless found guilty, and ordered removed from command. He was offered an opportunity to resign his commission, but he refused, and was thus dismissed on August 30, 1864. Later life and family After his dismissal, Spears returned to his farm in Bledsoe County, and began rebuilding his fortune. His health, which had suffered during the war, continued to decline. He died at his home on July 22, 1869, and was interred in the Pikeville City Cemetery. Spears married Adeline Brown in 1849. They had six children. Spears's son, Colonel William D.

It is located at 66 Maginhawa Street, UP Village, Quezon City. History The history of the school can be traced backed in 1959 when Mother Maria Valentina Ayerra of the Servants of St. Joseph, then superior of the Holy Family Dormitory-Manila, procured a lot that would be later used for Holy Family School. The nuns from the Servants of St. Joseph later started the construction of the school in 1966 in three phases and was completed in 1971. The operations of the school began on July 1966 with a class of 50 students, both boys and girls. Two rooms were used which were the facilities available for use at that time. Boys were admitted for the pre-school level until the practice was discontinued in the mid 1980s due to limited number of classrooms and the school administration prioritized admitting female students. Due to the growing student population from 1967 to 1975, the Novitiate which stayed on the top floor of the school building transferred to a small house within the compound of the school. Another house was built in 1975 to accommodate working girls and some of the faculty members. In 1981, The Novitiate transferred to Tandang Sora when the Servants of St. Joseph nuns moved into the house they previously occupied. During its early years from (1968-1974), Holy Family School established the Holy Family Clinic and Holy Family School Branch which primarily served Barrio San Vicente. The school also sent selected fourth year students to Pinyahan Elementary School to give Catechetics. For two years in a certain period of the school's history, that the school offered Vocational Course related to dressmaking. From 1985 to 1989, the school provided free late afternoon classes for working high school students both male and female and other students from poor families. As part of the celebration of the Silver Jubilee of the school in 1991, the Educational Assistance Program (EAP) which gave scholarships to poor students who were deemed deserving by the school was revitalized and expanded.

It is administered directly into the bloodstream of patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) in an effort to decrease the associated morbidity and mortality experienced in patients with kidney failure. IDPN contains protein (amino acids), carbohydrates (dextrose), and fats (lipids) in an attempt to meet a patient's weekly nutritional needs. Solutions can be individualized for each patient based on weight, needs, medical history and enteral intake. History Prior to 1990, traditional therapies for dialysis patients, such as liberalized diet and oral supplements, led to protein and/or calorie malnutrition. Efforts to supplement nutritional intake by providing nutrients during the dialysis procedure were attempted. As a result, IDPN became an established therapy to replete malnourished CKD-5 dialysis patients in the early 1990s. Generally the patients received a set formulation containing standard amounts of dextrose, amino acids and lipids regardless of the patient's weight, dialysis time, and complicating co-morbid conditions. New approach to IDPN therapy To address specific nutritional needs of individual patients, several providers of IDPN therapy developed formulations that take clinical variables into account in order to best fit the patient‚Äôs individual needs and condition. Specific formulations address distinct differences between nutritional needs of those patients who exhibit protein malnutrition and those patients who exhibit calorie malnutrition.

They are saltwater shrimp, and are common in saltwater aquariums. Description The camel shrimp is a hardy saltwater shrimp, It is covered with red and white stripes that run across its entire body. R. uritai has a movable rostrum or beak that is generally facing upwards. Male camel shrimp have larger chelipeds or claw compared to the female camel shrimp. The claw is formed when the shrimp reaches maturity. Ecology Rhynchocinetes uritai is found under cracks and crevasses, coral deposits, and rock caves because those habitats provide safe cover from predators. They are often seen with other camel shrimp in their habitat. The common predators of Rhynchocinetes uritai are herring, salmon, sculpin and flatfishes. Rhynchocinetes uritai is a carnivorous shrimp and it feeds on detritus, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and frozen or freeze-dried bits of seafood. In captivity, camel shrimp will accept a varied diet of prepared fresh and frozen foods suitable for carnivores, examples of this are: vitamin enriched flakes, freeze dried krill, or live adult brine shrimp or nauplii. Behaviour Camel shrimp are carnivores feeding on plankton, and other small meats, they look for food by plowing through the sand, separating food, and sand particles, this behavior improves the aquarium environment at the same time due to the fact that they are aerating it. As the shrimp grows it needs to undergo a moulting process which replaces its old exoskeleton with a harder new one, the shrimp may molt several times during its life. Camel shrimp has a tendency to damage soft corals, and anemones. Like most shrimp, it is nocturnal and usually hides during daylight hours, coming out at night to feed.

Based in the regions of Lombardy and Piemont the corps was the army's operational reserve, while the 4th Alpine Army Corps and the 5th Army Corps, both based in the North East of Italy, were the army's front-line units. After the end of the Cold War the corps was reduced in size and on 1 December 2000 it ceded its last brigades to the 1st Defence Forces Command (COMFOD 1¬∞). The personnel of the 3rd Army Corps was used to raise the NATO Rapid Deployable Italian Corps in January 2001.  History   Origins  The history of the 3rd Army Corps begins after the second Italian war of independence. Following the Italian-French victory over the Austrian Empire, the Kingdom of Sardinia annexed the Papal Legations in present-day Emilia Romagna. Thus on 1 April 1860 the 3rd Higher Military Command was activated as a territorial command in Parma and tasked to defend the newly acquired territory between the Trebbia and Panaro rivers, an area roughly corresponding with the historic Emilia region. The command consisted of the 5th, 8th and 12th division of the Line. At the outbreak of the third Italian war of independence the command was renamed as III Army Corps and participated in the Italian Mincio campaign aimed at the Austrian Quadrilatero fortresses with the 7th, 8th, 9th and 16th divisions of the line. On 24 June 1866 the corps was one of two engaged in the Battle of Custoza. In August 1867 the III Army Corps was disbanded. However, on 14 June 1869 the III Army Corps was raised again in Naples and given territorial duties. Until the outbreak of World War I the corps remained as a territorial command in Italy.  World War I  After the Italian declaration of war against the Austrian Empire on 23 May 1915 the III Army Corps under Lieutenant General Vittorio Camerana advanced on the extreme left flank of the Italian Army through the Valtellina, Camonica Trompia and Chiese valleys and along the Western shore of Lake Garda into Trentino. Although numerically superior the corps failed to cross the Stelvio and Tonale pass and advanced only until Riva del Garda and Tione, but failed to take either of the two cities. The corps consisted of the 5th and 6th Division of the Line (Infantry), the 35th Territorial Division, the 7th Bersaglieri Regiment and the 5th Alpini Regiment. All soldiers of the 5th Alpini Regiment had been recruited in the aforementioned valleys and thus fought in a territory they knew perfectly well. However the 5th Alpini Regiment was never employed as a whole, but single companies or battalions were given specific mountain summits, ridges or passes to conquer and hold. * III Army Corps (Lieutenant General Vittorio Camerana) ** 5th Division of the Line (Major General Druetti) *** Brigade of the Line Cuneo **** 7th Line Infantry Regiment **** 8th Line Infantry Regiment *** Brigade of the Line Palermo **** 67th Line Infantry Regiment **** 68th Line Infantry Regiment *** 27th Territorial Field Artillery Regiment (5x batteries) *** 10th Sapper Company / 2nd Engineer Regiment *** Divisional Service units ** 6th Division of the Line (Major General Roffi) *** Brigade of the Line Sicilia **** 61st Line Infantry Regiment **** 62nd Line Infantry Regiment *** Brigade of the Line Toscana **** 77th Line Infantry Regiment **** 78th Line Infantry Regiment *** 16th Field Artillery Regiment (8x batteries) *** 11th Sapper Company / 2nd Engineer Regiment *** Divisional Service units ** 35th Territorial Division (Major General De Chaurand de Saint Eustache) *** Brigade of the Line Parma **** 49th Line Infantry Regiment **** 50th Line Infantry Regiment *** Brigade of the Line Milano **** 159th Line Infantry Regiment **** 160th Line Infantry Regiment *** 2x squadrons of the 27th Cavalleggeri di Aquila Cavalry Regiment *** 42nd Territorial Field Artillery Regiment (8x batteries) *** 15th Sapper Company / 2nd Engineer Regiment *** Divisional Service units ** 5th Alpini Regiment (Morbegno, Tirano, Edolo, Vestone, Val d'Intelvi, Valtellina, Val Camonica, Val Chiese Alpini battalions) ** 7th Bersaglieri Regiment (VIII, X, XI, XLV Bersaglieri battalions) ** 27th Cavalleggeri di Aquila Cavalry Regiment ** III Guardia di Finanza Frontier Battalion ** 6th Field Artillery Regiment (8x batteries) ** II Group / 1st Heavy Field Artillery Regiment (2x batteries) ** 1st Tunnelling Engineers Battalion ** 18th Sapper Company / 2nd Engineer Regiment ** 4th Telegraph Engineers Company ** Army Corps Service units After the initial advance had been brought to a halt by the Austro- Hungarian Army the corps dug in and, although fierce fighting continued - especially on the Adamello glaciers - the front in the corps' sector remained almost unchanged until the end of the war. The front became so static that the 35th Territorial Division was sent to participate in the Allied war effort in Macedonia. After the Italian defeat in the Battle of Caporetto the III Corps was taken out of the front and became the Army's reserve corps, tasked with countering any enemy breakthrough on the Piave front during the winter of 1917/18. In spring of 1918 the corps returned to its original area of deployment. After Austria signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti the III corps finally advanced into Trentino.  World War II  After the war the III Army Corps returned to its garrison in Milan. After the drawdown of forces in the early 1920s the corps consisted of the 6th Infantry Division Legnano in Milan, the 7th Infantry Division Leonessa in Brescia and the 8th Infantry Division Po in Piacenza. In spring of 1936 the corps was sent to Eritrea to reinforce the Italian troops that faced stiffer than expected resistance during the Italian invasion of Abyssinia. The corps commanded the 27th Infantry Division Sila, 2nd Blackshirt Division 28 Ottobre and a brigade sized formation with light tanks. The corps fought in the First Battle of Tembien, Battle of Amba Aradam and Second Battle of Tembien. After the return to Milan the corps was given the task to defend Italy along the Swiss-Italian border. To aid in its task the corps was given command of the Alpine Wall fortifications in its area of operation. When Italy declared war on France on 10 June 1940 the corps was near the French-Italian border in Limone Piemonte. The Italian Army only performed limited patrols and remained in its positions until after France had asked for an armistice on 20 June 1940. The next day the Italian divisions crossed the border in force, but stiff French resistance stopped them along the entire front after a few kilometres. During the campaign the corps commanded the 3rd Mountain Infantry Division Ravenna, 6th Infantry Division Cuneo and a mixed unit of four Alpini and two Mountain Artillery battalions. After the Italian invasion of Greece in October 1940 bogged down under stiff Greek resistance the III Army Corps was dispatched to Albania to augment the Italian forces along the Macedonian front. The corps commanded the 19th Infantry Division Venezia, 36th Mountain Infantry Division Forl√¨, 48th Infantry Division Taro and 53rd Infantry Division Arezzo and the 4th Bersaglieri regiment as Corps reserve. All Italian attacks were repulsed by the Greeks until German forces invaded Greece through Bulgaria and cut the Greek Armies on the Albanian front off. Afterwards the III Army Corps advanced to Thebes where it remained on garrison duty until September 1943 when it surrendered to German forces after the Italian-Allied armistice.  Cold War  Structure of the 3rd Army Corps in 1986 before the divisional level was abolished (click to enlarge) Structure of the 3rd Army Corps in 1989 at the end of the Cold War (click to enlarge) On 15 June 1945 the III Territorial Military Command was activated in Milan which at the time controlled only the Infantry Division Legnano in Bergamo. The Legnano was a unit of the Italian Co-Belligerent Army and had served on the Allied side during the Italian campaign. Following service with the American 5th Army, the Legnano served with the Polish II Corps on the extreme left of the British 8th Army. When the corps regained its historic name on 1 July 1957 it included besides the Legnano the Armoured Division Centauro in Novara, the Infantry Division Cremona and Alpine Brigade Taurinense both in Turin. In 1972 the Taurinense was transferred to the IV Alpine Army Corps. The corps - along with the 4th Alpine Army Corps and 5th Army Corps was part of NATOs Allied Land Forces Southern Europe Command (LANDSOUTH) in Verona. In 1975 the Italian Army undertook a major reorganisation: the regimental level was abolished and battalions came under direct command of brigades, which combined units from different combat arms. In the same year the spelling of the name of the corps was changed from III Army Corps to 3rd Army Corps. Furthermore, the Cremona and Legnano divisions were reduced to brigades and therefore the 3rd Army Corps' new structure on 21 October 1975 was as follows: * 35px 3rd Army Corps in Milan: ** 30px Armoured Division Centauro in Novara *** 30px Armoured Brigade Curtatone in Bellinzago Novarese *** 30px Mechanized Brigade Goito in Milan *** 30px Mechanized Brigade Legnano in Bergamo ** 30px Motorized Brigade Cremona in Turin In 1986 the Italian Army abolished the divisional level and realigned its forces to counter a possible Warsaw Pact attack better. The 3rd Army Corps was to either act as last line of defence along the Adige and Po rivers or to counter-attack broken through enemy forces in the Venetian plains. The corps was augmented by two mechanized brigades and as the Centauro division carried a historically significant name, the division ceased to exist on 31 October in Novara, but the next day in the same location the Armoured Brigade Centauro was activated and took command of the units of the Curtatone: * 35px 3rd Army Corps in Milan: ** 30px Armored Brigade Centauro (Novara) ** 30px Mechanized Brigade Goito (Milan) ** 30px Mechanized Brigade Legnano (Bergamo) ** 30px Mechanized Brigade Brescia (Brescia) ** 30px Mechanized Brigade Trieste (Bologna) ** 30px Motorized Brigade Cremona (Turin) Each brigade, with the exception of the Centauro, fielded about 4,700 men. The Centauro fielded about 3,400 men and together with the corps' support units the entire corps fielded over 40,000 men. In 1982 Bersaglieri of the Legnano brigade were deployed in Italys first operation outside its soil since World War II as part of the Multinational Force in Lebanon.  After the Cold War  With the end of the Cold War the Italian Army began a decade long reduction of its forces. The first brigade to disband was the Goito on 1 June 1991, followed by the Brescia on 27 July 1991. Also on 1 June 1991 the Trieste ceased its colours in Bologna and in its stead the Mechanized Brigade Friuli arrived from Florence. The Friuli took command of some units of the disbanded Trieste and entered the ranks of the 3rd Army Corps. In September 1993 the Legnano brigade deployed to Somalia in support of United Nations Unified Task Force mission. In spring 1997 the Corps assumed responsibility for Operation Alba, the first multinational mission led by Italy, in the wake of the Albanian Rebellion of 1997. In 1997 the army undertook the next big reform process. The 3rd Army Corps saw its Cremona and Legnano brigades disbanded. It also had to cede the Centauro to the 5th Army Corps. On 1 October 1997 the 3rd Army Corps changed its name and became the Projection Forces Command (Comando Forze di Proiezione or COMFOP) and gained the Parachute Brigade Folgore, the Bersaglieri Brigade Garibaldi and the amphibious Lagunari Regiment Serenissima, thus the corps commanded all rapidly deployable units of the Italian Army. The new structure of the corps was: * COMFOP in Milan ** Parachute Brigade Folgore in Livorno ** Mechanized Brigade Friuli in Bologna ** Bersaglieri Brigade Garibaldi in Caserta ** Lagunari Regiment Serenissima in Venice-Lido ** 1st Signal Regiment (3rd Signal Battalion Spluga) in Milano ** 10th Engineer Regiment (3rd Engineer Battalion Lario) in Cremona ** 26th Infantry Regiment Bergamo (1x training battalion) in Diano Castello ** 33rd Logistic Regiment Ambrosiano (1x battalion) in Solbiate Olona ** 121st Infantry Regiment Macerata (1x training battalion) in Fano However already on 1 December 2000 it ceded its last brigades to the 1st Defence Forces Command (COMFOD 1¬∞). The personnel of the 3rd Army Corps was used to raise the NATO Rapid Deployable Italian Corps in January 2001.

It was 35 miles long and it linked the town of Somain in the d√©partement du Nord with Halluin near the Belgian border, via Orchies and Tourcoing. Today, most of the line is closed to passengers, except a 12-mile section between Orchies and Ascq which is used by TER Nord-Pas-de-Calais.  History  On 15 September 1871, the French North Eastern railway was awarded a concession to construct the Somain to Roubaix & Tourcoing railway. The line aimed to transport coal to support textile industries in the area. Local municipalities had been consulted in June 1871, and a definitive route was published just over three years later on 12 January 1875. In 1876, the French Northern Railway acquired various railway lines in the area, including the short part of the Somain-Halluin Railway which was then open (10 miles between Somain and Orchies). In 1879, the line reached Tourcoing. The first section of the line to lose passenger trains was the stretch between Somain and Orchies, where services were withdrawn on 15 May 1939. The section between Ascq and Tourcoing followed six weeks later. Passenger services were maintained until December 1971 between Toircoing and Halluin. Closure After passenger services were withdrawn, freight services continued to use the line.

He was a Confucian scholar of the Qin and Western Han dynasties of ancient China, famous for saving the Confucian classic Shangshu (Book of Documents) from the book burning of the First Emperor of Qin. Biography Fu Sheng was a native of Jinan prefecture (ÊøüÂçó, in present-day Zouping or Zhangqiu, Shandong province), and was said to be a descendant of the legendary ancient ruler Fu Xi. He was a boshi (ÂçöÂ£´, \\"erudite\\") of the Qin dynasty. In 213 BC the First Emperor of Qin ordered the Burning of Books and killed many Confucian scholars. Risking his life, Fu Sheng hid a copy of the book in the walls of his house. He later escaped his hometown in the warfare that soon broke out and eventually ended the Qin dynasty. After the Han dynasty was established in 206 BC, Fu Sheng returned home and retrieved the scrolls. However, he was only able to recover 29 chapters; the rest (tens of chapters) had been lost to damage or decay. (Some scholars believe that Fu Sheng memorized the chapters instead of recovering them from the walls.) According to Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian, when Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180‚Äì157 BC) searched the country for copies of the Shangshu, Fu Sheng was the only person who could produce one. As Fu was already over 90 years old and unable to travel, Emperor Wen dispatched the official Chao Cuo to study the Shangshu from him. Fu's daughter or granddaughter had to interpret the old man's words for the official. \\"The daughter‚Äôs role was crucial because Fu Sheng spoke only the dialect of the ancient state of Qi, an idiom incomprehensible to the official charged with transcribing the text.\\" Fu's other disciples, surnamed Ouyang and Zhang, also became masters of Shangshu. Master Ouyang's great-grandson Ouyang Gao (Ê≠êÈôΩÈ´ò) would later found one of the three main schools for the study of Shangshu. Kong Anguo, the scholar who later compiled the \\"old text\\" Shangshu, also studied with him. The commentary Shangshu Dazhuan (Â∞öÊõ∏Â§ßÂÇ≥, Amplification of the Shangshu) is traditionally attributed to Fu Sheng, but much of the work was probably done by his disciples Ouyang and Zhang (both fl. 180‚Äì157 BC), or even later scholars. Legacy Along with Dong Zhongshu, Fu Sheng is recognized as one of the most important Confucianists of the Han Dynasty. He is often venerated in Confucian temples along with other sages, and has been a subject of many poems, essays, and paintings. Tang dynasty poet-painter Wang Wei's portrait of him is now in the collection of the Osaka City Museum of Fine Arts in Japan, and another portrait by the Ming dynasty painter Cui Zizhong is in the Shanghai Museum. Fu Sheng's family remained prominent throughout the Han dynasty. His descendant Fu Shou married Emperor Xian, the last emperor of Han. Fu Sheng's offspring held the title of Wujing Boshi (‰∫îÁ∂ìÂçöÂ£´; W«îjƒ´ng B√≥sh√¨). Fu's tomb is still extant in Zouping County, Shandong province. Its remains measure 45 meters in diameter and 2 meters in height. In Zouping there also used to be a Fu Sheng Temple, a Fu Sheng Academy, and a Fu Sheng Township.

Seedman (August 9, 1918 ‚Äì May 17, 2013) was an officer with the New York City Police Department (NYPD) for 30 years, known for solving several high-profile cases before resigning as chief of the Detective Bureau. He was the only Jewish officer to ever hold that position. After his retirement he was the chief of security for a New York area department store chain before retiring to South Florida. Seedman established himself as a detective during the 1960s. As the detective commander for Brooklyn, he oversaw an investigation of a shooting death, in which over 2,000 people were interviewed, that he soon realized was actually a freak accident (and found the shooter by starting from a randomly chosen location). He investigated many prominent crimes during that era, including the Borough Park Tobacco robbery and the Kitty Genovese murder. As the chief of detectives he reformed that branch by assigning detectives to specialize in certain crimes rather than just investigating whatever cases came their way when they were on shift. His tenure as chief of detectives of the city was short but memorable, marked by the Knapp Commission's corruption investigations which briefly cost him his job, several mob hits, and terror attacks carried out by the Black Liberation Army (BLA). When his superior officers hindered his investigation into the murder of an officer at a Harlem mosque out of fear of racial unrest, Seedman resigned his position and retired from the force, although he did not say that had been the reason for another 40 years. Frequently and accurately described as \\"cigar-chomping\\" and \\"tough-talking\\", with a personal style likened by a colleague to a Jewish gangster, he was one of the city's most visible police personnel during the 1960s and early 1970s. Newspapers often included a quote from Chief Seedman; he was frequently on evening television news as well. He was always willing to speak to reporters even if he could not tell them much. After his retirement he wrote Chief!, a memoir of his time on the force and the high-profile cases he had been involved in, and appeared as a detective in the 1975 film Report to the Commissioner with Hector Elizondo and Tony King. Early life Seedman was born to a taxi driver and his wife, a sewing machine operator in the Garment District, on Fox Street, near St. Mary's Park in the South Bronx in 1918. He was given no middle name, just the initial \\"A\\". In school he served as a stairwell monitor, which he said later gave him the idea to become a police officer. Seedman grew up in one of the toughest neighborhoods in the borough, with many Irish American street gangs. Seedman did not get involved with them, however. \\"It was a Jewish block\\", he recalled, \\"and Jewish kids didn't fight.\\" After finishing high school he attended the business school at City College of New York, now Baruch College. Upon graduating in 1941 with a degree in accounting, he joined the New York City Transit Police because civil service paid higher salaries than any private- sector jobs available at that time, and police agencies paid the most. After studying French for a year, he left the department to serve in Army intelligence and the military police in France and Belgium, including the Battle of the Bulge. When World War II ended he rejoined the transit police, and thereafter the NYPD. Police career In the late 1940s, there were few Jews in the NYPD and none above the rank of captain. Seedman recalled later in his life that there was some attendant bias. \\"I didn't get the choice assignments\\", he said. \\"I think it was because I was Jewish.\\" He also earned graduate degrees in public administration during this time. As a detective, Seedman was known for his unorthodox approaches to solving otherwise perplexing cases. \\"I try to imagine who was in a room the second before the murder,\\" he recalled years later. In one case early in his career, a Bronx woman was found dead of a shotgun blast in the lobby of her apartment building. Seedman noticed an empty chair next to the building's stoop. Neighbors told him it was usually occupied by a man who sat there watching the traffic go by. Although the man normally was out shopping at the time, but Seedman insisted on entering the his apartment through a window‚Äîwhere he found his body hanging from a pipe. The murder-suicide had occurred after the woman rejected him. 1962‚Äì1971: As detective By 1962, Seedman had become a captain. That year brought him his first media exposure, to the brief detriment of his career. Two officers who had responded to a robbery in progress at the Borough Park Tobacco Company in Brooklyn, where Seedman worked at the time, were killed. It was the first time a pair of NYPD officers had been killed on duty in 30 years. When one of the suspects, Tony Dellernia, was extradited to New York after surrendering in Chicago, Seedman, as was customary, had him perp-walked in front of reporters outside the precinct house. alt=A black-and-white photograph showing a man wearing a jacket and tie with a short sigar in his mouth, on the left, holding up the chin of a man on the right, who appears to be in pain Some photographers who arrived late complained to Seedmen. He obligingly brought Dellernia back out, but the defendant had his head low. Seedman, knowing he would regret doing so, forced Dellernia's head up and held him by the chin so his face would be visible. The ensuing image of Dellernia's contorted face, \\"[stretched] ... as if it were pizza dough\\", as The New York Times put it in 1999, while Seedman mugged for the camera himself, sparked widespread public outcry. The American Civil Liberties Union demanded he be disciplined, and he was duly reprimanded after Commissioner Michael J. Murphy publicly expressed regret for the incident. A promotion to deputy inspector Seedman had been expecting was delayed. Dellernia was ultimately acquitted. Seedman nevertheless displayed the photo on his office wall in his Long Island home. Two years later, Seedman came back into the public eye, when he led the investigation into the murder of Kitty Genovese in the Queens neighborhood of Kew Gardens. The case had gained national attention when a story in the Times alleged that 38 neighbors had witnessed the crime in progress but did nothing about it, even as Genovese screamed for help repeatedly (an account that has since been disputed). Seedman's detectives arrested the killer, Winston Moseley, six days later. The death sentence he had originally received was commuted when New York abolished the death penalty for most murders, and Moseley served the remaining 52 years of his life in prison. In mid-1967, Seedman, then chief detective for southern Brooklyn, made his reputation as an investigator who could solve baffling cases. While driving on the Belt Parkway one summer morning near Plum Beach, a young woman named Nancy McEwen suddenly drifted off the road onto the median strip. A police lieutenant in the car behind her pulled over to see what the problem was. He found her moaning, with her head slumped forward, and called for an ambulance. She died a short time later at Coney Island Hospital, where doctors found a small hole on the side of her head that turned out to have been caused by a bullet. Since only one window in McEwen's car was open, and none of them had been shattered, Seedman believed the shot had to have been fired from Sheepshead Bay or the nearby area, and that due to the distance and the car's speed, it was probably not intentional. He ordered detectives and uniformed officers to search the dunes and marshes for a possible shell casing. After 2,400 people were interviewed and several other leads came to nothing, he pointed at a spot on the map and told his detectives to look for people who owned boats. That led to the shooter‚Äîa local gas station owner who had been on his boat that morning taking target practice at a floating beer can. One of his bullets had ricocheted off the water's surface and killed McEwen. A grand jury ruled it an accident, and no homicide charges were brought, although the shooter was fined $100 for violating firearms laws with the rifle. =Greenwich Village townhouse explosion= On April 6, 1970, a townhouse on West 11th Street in Greenwich Village exploded in the early afternoon, damaging not only itself but several adjacent buildings, including the home of actor Dustin Hoffman and his wife. Responding firefighters at first believed it to be a gas explosion resulting from a leak and accidental ignition, but the senior responding detective was suspicious and called Seedman to the scene, where he set up a command post along with senior fire department officials and the FBI. Seedman's suspicions were deepened by reports that known survivors of the blast had left the scene and not returned. Seedman contacted radio executive James Wilkerson, the owner of the property. He learned that Wilkerson was planning to return from a vacation in the Caribbean that day; in the meantime his daughter Cathy had been staying there, recuperating from a bout with the flu. Cathy was known to the FBI to be a member of the Weathermen, a radical left-wing activist group, and had been arrested at several demonstrations over the last two years. Seedman concluded that the explosion had been perhaps deliberately set, but did not know what the motive might have been other than Cathy Wilkerson's relationship with her father, from whom she was estranged. It took the fire department until after sunset to extinguish most of the fire. In the rubble police found two dismembered bodies, weapons, and enough dynamite to level the entire block if it had gone off; after the block was evacuated yet more was found, along with an antitank weapon. Seedman told the media it was the largest explosive device ever found in Manhattan. He asked James Wilkerson and his wife, now returned, to appear on television and appeal to Cathy to at least let the police know whether they had found all the explosives and bodies. Cathy never did. She and other Weathermen remained at large for most of the 1970s before surrendering to authorities; she was the only one to serve prison time. The Greenwich Village explosion had been an accident that killed three, resulting from the inexperienced leadership of the New York Weather cell attempting to build a bomb they intended to set off at an Army noncommissioned officers' dance at Fort Dix that night, an attack intended to bring the Vietnam War to the American home front. 1971‚Äì72: Chief of detectives In 1971, Seedman became chief of detectives for the department. He was the first, and only, Jewish officer to hold that position, which had usually, like many of the NYPD's other high-ranking positions, gone to the Irish Americans who made up the bulk of the ranks. \\"The Jewish cop was an alien in an Irish universe,\\" crime novelist Jerome Charyn recalled in 2004. Seedman's personal, trademark style made him stand out. He complemented his cigar with white-on-white patterned shirts with \\"Al\\" monogrammed on the sleeves, elaborate rings on both hands including an onyx pinky ring, and a pearl-handled revolver as his weapon. \\"[He is] what a Jewish gangster is supposed to look like,\\" one fellow detective told The New York Times. \\"I didn't do any of this stuff consciously, but it was my style,\\" Seedman explained late in his life. \\"I've been referred to as the last of the old-time Broadway-style detectives.\\" \\"He's got style; he's the way cops like to see themselves,\\" another officer said to the Times in 1972. Reporters liked him because he was always willing to talk to them on the record, even if he could not say much. He was the department's preferred spokesperson for what it called \\"front-page crimes.\\" Of the department's senior commanders, the same detective who praised Seedman's style in the Times said, \\"[he's t]he only one who comes across on the tube‚Äîand in a media age you must have a guy like that.\\" As chief, he began to modernize the detective bureau, which at nearly 3,000 officers was larger than all but 12 American police departments. During his career, detectives had traditionally worked whatever cases developed from crimes reported during their shifts at the precinct house. Under Seedman, following a practice already adopted by the Chicago and Los Angeles police departments, they were instead assigned to specialize in a particular category of crime, such as homicide or robbery. Patrol officers were also permitted to investigate some lesser crimes on their own, such as assaults or car thefts; by 1972 they were already handling 70 percent of the reported burglary cases. Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy called it \\"the first major change in the force in half a century.\\" The department's internal affairs were receiving attention from outside as well. After a 1970 New York Times story, prompted by the revelations of Frank Serpico, alleged that widespread corruption in the department was tolerated or ignored by commanders and the mayor's office, Mayor John V. Lindsay appointed what became known as the Knapp Commission, after Judge Whitman Knapp, who headed it, to investigate. The commission found evidence that in 1970, Seedman had accepted a free dinner worth $84.30 ($ in current dollars) from the New York Hilton Midtown, for himself, his wife and two guests. Since this was relatively minor compared to many of the allegations the commission was investigating, it notified Murphy's office before it began hearings that it would not be raising the check. Murphy, distrustful of the commission and fearing that it had an ulterior motive, sent out a press release announcing that Seedman had been relieved of his position as chief of detectives. After this made headlines on all the city's newspapers, the commissioner reinstated him five days later. It was a challenging era for the department and its detectives. The city's homicides had almost quadrupled since the late 1950s, with a 30 percent increase in 1970 alone. There were many major crimes to investigate during his tenure. Two high-ranking figures in the city's Mafia were shot. Joseph Colombo Sr. was paralyzed from wounds inflicted by an assassin, himself killed seconds later, at an Italian Unity Day festival he had organized; although the department's investigation concluded the murder was not mob-related, Seedman continued to believe strongly that it had been, even though he admitted it would be difficult to prove. Ten months later, Joe Gallo, another member of the Colombo crime family, believed to have ordered the hit on his boss, was himself killed by gunmen at a Little Italy seafood restaurant. A prominent hotel's safe deposit boxes were robbed by gunmen dressed as guests. Seedman oversaw the investigations, and was the department's face in the media. =Black Liberation Army killings of police officers= The greatest challenge to the department and its detectives during Seedman's tenure as chief of the bureau was another violent left-wing group, the Black Liberation Army (BLA). An offshoot of the Black Panthers which espoused a more militant and radical philosophy, the BLA staged deadly ambushes on police officers in cities across the country. In New York, their three attacks left four officers dead and two seriously wounded. After one attack, the \\"Attica Brigade\\" of the BLA claimed responsibility, a reference to the Attica prison riots the previous year, in which 19 prisoners had died when New York State Police stormed the prison. After the second attack, in January 1972, Senior NYPD officials were wary of publicly attributing the killings to the BLA, or even acknowledging the group's existence. Lindsay had changed his party affiliation from Republican to Democratic the previous year in order to seek the latter party's presidential nomination, and his aides told the police that publicly discussing the investigation of an African American terrorist group, one they considered largely an invention of disgruntled former Black Panthers, dedicated to killing police officers would conflict with the mayor's campaign themes; they also feared exacerbating racial tensions in the city. In his news conference the day after the killings, Seedman downplayed notions that they were the work of the BLA although the police had received mail from them, taking credit and promising more. But deputy commissioner Robert Daley, the department's press secretary, dissented. He held a news conference of his own, telling the assembled reporters that the two killings were the work of the BLA, and when it did not receive sufficient coverage kept having off the record discussions with individual reporters. In February 1972, Commissioner Murphy held a more detailed media event describing in detail the BLA's activities not just in New York but nationwide. It was in this context that the incident that ended Seedman's police career occurred. =1972 Harlem mosque incident= alt=A two-story brick building on a city street with arched windows, a green dome atop in the center and storefronts at street level On April 14, dispatchers received a 9-1-1 call from a \\"Detective Thomas\\", claiming to need assistance at the Nation of Islam's Mosque No. 7 on West 116th Street in Harlem. Five uniformed officers responded; accounts of events at the mosque differ. The police say they were overpowered and assaulted when they arrived; Imam Louis Farrakhan and the other worshippers present say the police interrupted them with guns drawn during prayers and refused repeated requests to wait or at least leave behind their guns, which the Black Muslims' faith forbade from being carried into a place of worship. At a press conference the next day, Farrakhan would claim it was a premeditated attack and the 9-1-1 call just a ruse. In the ensuing altercation, one officer, Phillip Cardillo, was shot at close range with his own gun. Another officer's gun went missing; it has never been recovered. Police reinforcements arrived, as did the news media, and rumors spread throughout the neighborhood that the police had done something in the mosque they were trying to cover up. An angry and restless crowd had gathered as the police secured the inside of the mosque and tried to figure out what had happened. Two men were arrested and the other worshippers were in custody. Seedman planned to interrogate them when he arrived. Seedman never got the chance. Farrakhan and newly elected congressman Charles Rangel, who had come to the scene, warned them that the crowd outside, already throwing rocks, assaulting reporters present and attempting to damage police property, was beyond their control. Seedman claimed Rangel offered to have the mosque worshippers show up at the local precinct house if the police left the scene; Rangel has said that he could not, and did not, make such a promise on their behalf. Seedman reluctantly gave the order to leave the mosque and free the suspects. The police department ordered all white officers to withdraw to several blocks from the mosque. As Seedman walked back to his car, dodging bricks dropped from nearby roofs, he decided to retire, ending his NYPD career two weeks later. At the time, he claimed his retirement was unrelated to the mosque incident; rather, he was attracting too much publicity and the department wanted to focus more on the uniformed patrol officers who made up the bulk of the ranks. Six days later, Officer Cardillo died in the hospital; his death is the only unsolved killing of an officer in the NYPD's modern history. Many of his colleagues believed the failure to fully investigate it resulted from senior police administrators' political cowardice; at his funeral, which uncharacteristically neither Commissioner Murphy nor Mayor Lindsay attended, Cardillo's commander angrily resigned from the department. An agreement was reached between the department and the mosque that designated it a \\"sensitive area\\", where police could not enter without their supervisors; this prevented the collection of ballistic evidence for two years. In its absence, Louis 17X Dupree, who an informant had seen standing over Cardillo's body with a gun, was acquitted. Seedman's role in the police's exit from the mosque was not known until a secret report was released in 1983, as Deputy Commissioner Benjamin Ward, who many officers blamed for the order to withdraw, was on the verge of becoming the city's first African American police commissioner. The secret report, known as the \\"blue book\\", indicated that Seedman, not Ward, had given the order. Confronted with this by a Newsday reporter, who wanted to know why he had let Ward take the blame for so many years, Seedman said \\"What good would it have done?\\" With the truth now known, Ward became commissioner. Late in his life, Seedman finally revealed why he had given the order. In a new preface to the 2011 e-book release of his 1974 memoir Chief!, he explained what he had kept to himself for four decades. With the tensions outside escalating, he had called Chief Inspector Michael Codd from the mosque and asked for two busloads of police cadets armed with nightsticks to keep order on the street outside. Codd refused and hung up. When Seedman called back he was told that Codd was out to lunch. That failure to support officers in the field had been the real reason for his retirement. He had kept it to himself since \\"I loved the police department so much that I couldn't drag it through the dirt by saying what those bastards did.\\" Post- police career and retirement After retiring from the NYPD, Seedman took a job he had been offered previously as chief of security for the Alexander's department store chain. With journalist Peter Hellman, he wrote Chief!, a memoir of some of the celebrated cases he had worked, such as the Genovese and McEwen deaths. He also appeared as an NYPD detective in the 1975 film Report to the Commissioner, Richard Gere's debut. He eventually retired from Alexander's before the chain folded in 1992, and moved to Boynton Beach, Florida. He kept a replica of his gold \\"Chief of Detectives\\" shield to show people, and told the author of a 2006 book about Jewish police officers that he still carried his pearl-handled revolver \\"in case there is trouble.\\" In November 2012, Seedman posted on his Facebook page that French President Fran√ßois Hollande had named him a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in recognition of his military service there during World War II. On May 17, 2013, Seedman died of congestive heart failure in Delray Beach, near his Florida home. He was 94. Legacy Many younger Jewish officers credited Seedman's visibility with encouraging their career choice. \\"They joined the force after reading about me in the papers,\\" crime novelist Jerome Charyn recalls Seedman saying. His own brother Harvey, a tough streetfighter in childhood, became a detective who served under Seedman, and his son Howard followed him into the force, an uncommon pattern in families of Jewish NYPD officers. Charyn credits this to the \\"mythical toughness\\" Seedman projected. Charyn tried to capture that quality in a character he modeled on Seedman. Barney \\"Cowboy\\" Rosenblatt, a detective in his novel Marilyn the Wild, carries a Colt revolver with his name and rank engraved near the trigger in a holster with small tassels, like Buffalo Bill. Charyn's narrator describes him as \\"the number-one Jew cop in the City of New York.\\" In September 2019 several news outlets reported on the NYPD's longest serving officer, chaplain Rabbi Alvin Kass, who was hired by Seedman. \\"He really wasn't sure who the right one was,\\" he said. \\"But he saw me about to play a game of handball and he figured 'a rabbi who plays handball. That's the kind of guy that ought to be the chaplain for the New York City Police Department.'\\" See also * List of New York City Police Department officers Notes References External links *, his former page maintained and updated since 2013 by his family Category:1918 births Category:2013 deaths Category:New York City Police Department officers Category:American police detectives Category:Jewish American police officers Category:Jewish American male actors Category:Jewish American writers Category:Baruch College alumni Category:American non-fiction crime writers Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:Chevaliers of the L√©gion d'honneur Category:People from the Bronx Category:People from Boynton Beach, Florida ","title":"Albert Seedman"},{"id":"39437923","text":"Csonka may refer to: *Csonka (surname), people with this name, including: *Csonka (automobile), a Hungarian automobile manufactured by J√°nos Csonka in Budapest from 1909 to 1912 *131762 Csonka, a main-belt minor planet ","title":"Csonka"},{"id":"39437929","text":"The Kawasaki Z series is a family of standard/naked bikes manufactured by Kawasaki since 1972.

Her sensational divorce from Edwin Forrest captivated the American public in the mid-1800s.  Early life  Sinclair was born in London, the eldest of John and Catherine Sinclair's four children. The Sinclairs were originally from Edinburgh, Scotland. Mr. Sinclair became a successful drummer in the militia and later a well-known singer, who toured the U.S. in the early 1830s. She was well-educated, and welcomed in the social and cultural circles of London society. At age nineteen, Sinclair attended a performance of The Gladiator, starring the popular American actor, Edwin Forrest, as Spartacus. She arranged to meet him and on June 23, 1837 they were married at a church in Covent Garden. Shortly thereafter, the Forrests moved to New York and lived there for the next twelve years.  Life in the U.S. and the Forrest Divorce Case  By many accounts, the Forrests lived as a happily married couple in New York from 1837‚Äì1849. Forrest became one of the prominent actors of his time, especially after his success in London, where previously American actors were not taken seriously. Forrest's acting work took him throughout the U.S., sometimes accompanied by Mrs. Forrest, who otherwise spent her time at their home on 22nd St. in New York City (NYC). Unfortunately, the Forrests had four children die during or immediately after childbirth. Mrs. Forrest's parents and sisters also spent considerable time in the U.S. and lived much of the time with the Forrests in NYC. One sister, Mrs. Voorheis, lived with her husband in NYC. Whenever Forrest toured outside of NYC, Mrs. Voorheis usually stayed with her at the Forrest home on 22nd St. Mrs. Forrest was an intellectual and a captivating conversationalist, who was quickly accepted into the social circle of the literary and artistic elite of NYC. The literati discussed such works as George Sand's novel,Consuelo, which proved fateful to the Forrests' marriage. Mrs. Forrest was known to socialize at home with other members of this social circle while Forrest was working onstage, either in New York or in other venues around the country. Forrest himself did not participate \\"and did not enjoy home company.\\" (p. 347) The Forrests' marriage began to unravel in 1848 when Forrest began to suspect that his wife had been unfaithful to him. The event that led to the Forrests' separation and divorce trial concerned Mrs. Forrest's relationship with George W. Jamieson, one of Forrest's fellow actors. While on tour in Cincinnati, Forrest left his wife in the company of Jamieson while running an errand. Apparently suspicious, he returned ahead of schedule and encountered Jamieson performing an amateur phrenological study of Mrs. Forrest's head. Forrest accepted this explanation but later took advantage of Mrs. Forrest's absence from home to read a letter Jamieson wrote to her in the form of George Sand's novel, Consuelo. According to Mrs. Forrest, who defended the novel, she had challenged Jamieson to write a love letter that rivaled Mrs. Sand's work in the novel. Mr. Forrest was unconvinced and immediately asked for a separation from Mrs. Forrest. The Forrests made a pledge to avoid publicizing the reasons for their separation, but by December 1849/January 1850 they both made public accusations about infidelity. Forrest sued for divorce in Pennsylvania with Mrs. Forrest filing a countersuit in New York shortly thereafter. Forrest's suit was rejected for reasons of non- residency in the state of Pennsylvania. Both parties accused the other of numerous incidents of infidelity. Their very sensational divorce publicized and provided vivid detail of the following accusations. Mrs. Forrest, represented by Charles O'Conor, accused Forrest of multiple affairs, most notably with the actress Josephine Clifton but also including several women living in New York. Forrest, represented by John Van Buren, accused his wife of scandalous and immoral behavior with several men, including Jamieson and the poet Nathaniel Parker Willis, who was named as a co-respondent in the case. Earlier, Willis published an anti-Forrest pamphlet, which led to Forrest beating Willis with a whip. Willis later filed another suit against Forrest as a result. On January 24, 1852, after six weeks of testimony, the court found in favor of Mrs. Forrest. Forrest's career was unaffected although he left the stage for a number of years. The settlement called for Forrest to pay $3000 alimony per year. He challenged the ruling for sixteen years, but eventually paid $68,000 in arrears and was obligated to pay $4000 per year afterwards. Mrs. Forrest received $100,000 from his estate when he died in 1872.  Life in the Theatre  Sinclair, circa 1868 Sinclair, who reverted to her maiden name after the divorce, had never intended a life on the stage and had never appeared onstage before her divorce, began her career as an actress shortly after the divorce, partly due to Forrest's challenge of the court ruling. She began working with the actor George Vandenhoff to prepare for a life of acting. On February 22, 1852, Sinclair appeared as Lady Teazle in School for Scandal at Brougham's Lyceum Theatre in New York. She ran to full houses for eight consecutive nights. Some of her lines mirrored her well-known personal experiences and were greeted with delight by the audiences. In 1853, Sinclair moved to California to continue her acting career. In San Francisco, she appeared as Katherine opposite Edwin Booth's Petruchio in The Taming of the Shrew. In September, she played Portia to Booth's Shylock in The Merchant of Venice. Together they performed the melodrama The Marble Heart for an unprecedented forty three consecutive nights. Sinclair is reported to have worn a French gown worth $1200 ($19 was considered extravagant for a costume at that time). By Christmas, she became one of the few female actress managers by leasing the Metropolitan Theatre, \\"a very grand house against which smelly little San Francisco Hall couldn't hope to compete.\\" She opened on Christmas Eve with School for Scandal and hired Edwin Booth for juvenile leads and the rising star Laura Keene to play opposite him. Booth's brother, Junius, also worked for Sinclair at the Metropolitan. Keene and Booth opened in The Love Chase, which did not receive good reviews. Keene blamed this failure on \\"Booth's bad acting. Sinclair's Metropolitan Theatre, which she called the \\"most magnificent temple of histrionic art in America,\\" offered melodramas, burlesques, and romances starring the famous actors of the day. Throughout the 1850s, Sinclair acted in London, Australia, and the U.S. Her reviews lauded her physical beauty and stage presence, but her main attraction seems to have been her status as the former Mrs. Forrest. Her final performance was on December 18, 1859 at the Academy of Music in New York City. She retired the following year and lived with her sister, Mrs. Henry Sidley, in Staten Island.  Later life and death  After her sister's death, Sinclair lived in New York City with her nephew. She later went completely blind before dying in 1891 from a cerebral embolism.

Biography Vivin was self-taught and a representative of na√Øve painting. He showed great enthusiasm for painting as a child, but his career took him in a completely different direction: he worked as a postal clerk until 1922, pursuing his art only in his spare time. Eventually, he was discovered by the German art critic Wilhelm Uhde (1874‚Äì1947), an association which helped him start exhibitions and build a reputation as a serious artist. When he worked in the postal service, his job was an inspector. Once he retired in the year of 1923, Louis Vivin finally took up the full-time part of being an artist. His birthplace was in the city of Hadol, France. He moved to Paris, France in the year of 1889 where he lived with his wife in the district of Montparnasse. Works The subjects of Vivin's paintings were still life, hunting subjects, and the city of Paris. Vivin was a contemporary of Henri Rousseau, Camille Bombois, Andr√© Bauchant, and S√©raphine Louis, known collectively as the \\"Sacred Heart Painters\\" and as masters of French na√Øve painting. Vivin's works are known to have a sad and dismal theme to them. He was also known for painting from his memory. Louis Vivin was influenced by the work and details of Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier‚Äôs paintings. His works depicted genre scenes, flower pieces, hunting scenes and views of Paris, \\"notable for their charmingly wobbly perspective effects\\". Louis Vivin Retrieved on 28 Feb 2018 Louis Vivin‚Äôs first one-man exhibition was placed at the Galerie des Quatre Chemins, and it was organized by Wilhelm Uhde in 1927. His later work was considered to become less dependent of the melancholy mood, and it focused more on blocks of color and form.

Parasitic Plant Classification. The Parasitic Plant Connection. Department of Plant Biology, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale.Leistner, O. A. (2005). Balanophoraceae. Seed Plants of Southern Tropical Africa: Families and Genera. Southern African Botanical Diversity Network Report No. 26. pg 103. It is distributed throughout much of southern and western Africa, particularly the tropical regions. Common names for the plant include ground pineapple.Burkill, H. M. (1985). Thonningia sanguinea. The Useful Plants of West Tropical Africa, Vol 1. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. A familiar plant to humans, it has an extremely long list of common names in many African languages. Many names are inspired by the resemblance of the plant's inflorescence to a pineapple or palm tree. Some of the names can be translated as pineapple of the bush (from Anyi), duiker's kolanut (from Igala), and crown of the ground (from Yoruba). Description This species is a fleshy dioecious herb growing from an underground tuber. It is parasitic on other plants via its tuber. The branching, yellowish tuber extends horizontally up to 10 or 15 centimeters through the soil. It forms bulb-like swellings at the points where it attaches to the roots of its host plants. These swellings, or galls, can reach over 18 centimeters wide. The tuber can resemble a rhizome, but there is no true rhizome. The stem is coated with spirals of scale-like leaves. The leaves are not green; there is no chlorophyll, as the plant obtains nutrients from hosts and does not need to photosynthesize. The flowering stem emerges from the ground to produce a bright red or pink inflorescence containing male and female flowers. The crowded flower heads are covered in scales. The inflorescence is up to 15 to 20 centimeters long. Habitat, distribution, and ecology This plant grows in forests and other habitat. It can often be found in plantations, where it parasitizes such crop trees as Hevea brasiliensis (rubber), Phoenix dactylifera (date), and Theobroma cacao (cocoa).Jigam, A. A., et al. (2012). Efficacy of Thonningia Sanguinea Vahl. (Balanophoraceae) root extract against Plasmodium berghei, Plasmodium chabaudi, inflammation and nociception in mice. Journal of Applied Pharmaceutical Science 2(1) 47‚Äì51. This species is pollinated by flies and ants. Flies of the families Muscidae and Calliphoridae and ants of genus Technomyrmex visit the flowers to obtain nectar, pollinating the flowers as they enter. Muscid flies of genus Morellia lay eggs in the flowers and the larvae feed on the male flowers when they emerge. This could be an example of mutualism; as the fly pollinates the plant, it provides a site for egg-laying and nutrition for the larvae. Uses The plant is used as a traditional remedy in many African cultures. This includes in those with sexually transmitted diseases in Ghana. In those with diarrhea in the Congo. A portion of the leaves is used in those with worms. Mixed with Capsicum, it is used topically on hemorrhoids and torticollis. It is used for leprosy, skin infections and abscesses, dental caries, gingivitis, and heart disease. In Zaire, it is said to prevent incontinence and bedwetting. The other uses for the plant include as an ingredient in the poison applied to hunting arrows by peoples of C√¥te d'Ivoire. It is also known as a flavoring for soup. In some areas, the flower heads are considered to be an aphrodisiac. In Ghana and C√¥te d'Ivoire, the spiky flower heads are tied to the ankles of toddlers to encourage them to learn to walk; the spikes keep them from sitting down. All parts of the plant are used. The plant is considered a weed in some places, such as rubber plantations, where it can become abundant.Idu, M., et al. (2002).

He played for Queensland and Australia in the 1970s and 1980s. McLean is a former President of the Australian Rugby Union, and an inductee into the Australian Rugby Union Hall of Fame. He is currently Chief Executive Officer for Savills (Australia & New Zealand), responsible for overseeing Australasian operations of the multinational real estate services provider. Family and early life Paul McLean born in Ipswich, Queensland to Bob and Irene McLean. He attended St Edmund's College in Ipswich and Nudgee College in Brisbane. McLean played for the Ipswich Rangers, before joining Brothers in Brisbane, which was his local rugby club for the rest of his playing career. Seven members of the McLean family have represented Australia in rugby union or rugby league. His grandfather Doug McLean, Sr. and uncle Doug McLean, Jr. were dual code internationals who played for the Wallabies and Kangaroos. His uncle Bill captained the Wallabies in the wake of World War II and his uncle Jack toured with the Wallabies in 1946. His brother Jeff and cousin Peter also played for the Wallabies.Meares (2002), pp. 166‚Äì167. Rugby career McLean made his debut for the Queensland rugby team in 1973, and quickly progressed to make his Wallaby debut the following year against the All Blacks. He made 31 career test appearances between 1974 and 1982. He was a world-class goal kicker and at his prime there was no better tactical kicker in the game. He was also a gifted runner and passer when he took those options although later in his career critics were regularly calling for Mark Ella's more obvious running game to be brought into the Wallaby side. McLean played mostly at fly- half for the Wallabies but on some occasions was shifted to fullback or centre to make way for fly-half rivals Tony Melrose, Ken Wright and Mark Ella. McLean captained Australia on one occasion, leading the team to a 22‚Äì9 win against Fiji in Suva in 1980. In his 1982 farewell season, McLean reached 1,000 points for Queensland in his 100th and final game. He also scored 21 points against Scotland in his final Test match, which was the Australian individual record at that time. Brisbane newspaper journalist Hugh Lunn recorded the following on McLean's career in The Australian: On the day of McLean's final game for Queensland, the main grandstand at Ballymore was named the McLean Stand in honour of the contributions from the McLean family to Queensland rugby and Australian rugby. Post-rugby After retiring from playing rugby, McLean took up a position as sales manager in the Brisbane office of Ansett in 1982 and rose to become the state manager in the space of a year. He later moved into commercial real estate with FPD Savills as Director of Agency & Commercial Leasing. Paul went on to become Queensland Managing Director in 2002 and then Chief Executive Officer for Savills Australia & New Zealand in 2009, overseeing operations and employing more than 1000 staff. In April 2016, Paul stepped down as CEO to focus on the Queensland and New Zealand businesses, and growing the Savills presence in these markets. For six years from late 1999 to 2005, McLean was president of the Queensland Rugby Union. From 2005 to 2009 he was president of the Australian Rugby Union, later renamed Rugby Australia. McLean was inducted into the Australian Rugby Union Hall of Fame in 2011. He became chairman of Rugby Australia as an interim appointment to replace Cameron Clyne in February 2020 ahead of an annual general meeting the following month, and was replaced in May 2020 by Hamish McLennan. He is also a Director of Youngcare, a charitable organisation that works to create choice in care and housing options for young Australians with high care needs.

He was one of a number of social investigators who gathered information by going \\"undercover\\" to live as a worker. Biography Overview Whiting Williams was born Charles Whiting Williams on March 11, 1878 in Shelby, Ohio to Benjamin J. Williams and Ida Whiting. He is best known as the management consultant who went undercover to study various working conditions in the early twentieth century. He disguised himself as a laborer in coal mines, railroad shops, shipyards, and oil refineries in the United States, Europe, and Central and South America. At the commencement of his research in 1920, he wrote a book, \\"What's on the Workers Mind, Put On Coveralls To Find Out\\", followed by several other writings which documented the findings of his research. Education In 1899, Whiting Williams graduated from Oberlin College after which he continued his education at the University of Berlin for a year (1899-1900), and then the University of Chicago (1900‚Äì01). Thereafter, he managed the Bureau of University Travel (1901‚Äì04), and became the Assistant to the President at Oberlin College (1904‚Äì12). In the meantime, he earned a master's degree in 1909. Early career (1904-1918) Williams career started when he took a position as manager of the University Travel Bureau. He held this job until 1904, when he wrote a letter to the President of Oberlin College, Henry C. King, during his trip to Europe. In this, he suggested that a college president needed a full-time assistant to look after the less academic problems facing a school. In November of that same year Williams received a reply to his letter in which he was appointed assistant to the President. He held this position until 1912, and within this time period he met and married his first wife, Caroline Harter.Biography of Whiting Williams, Ohiolink In 1912, Williams moved to Cleveland, Ohio to co-found the Cleveland Federation for Charity and Philanthropy. This organization was based on the premise that the competition of charitable organizations with each other for contributions was detrimental to their best interests. In response to this, the Cleveland Federation proposed that a single organization conduct a single massive fund drive and disburse the contributions among the various charitable groups in the city. The Federation was groundbreaking in this attempt, and provided the foundation for what are known as Community Chest, United Fund, and United Way. In 1917, the organizations name changed to the Welfare Federation of Cleveland and Williams title became executive secretary within the Federation. He pioneered more than 2,400 United Appeals. In 1916, Williams obtained a group promoting and selling group insurance as a special representative for the Equitable Life Assurance Society. A position as such was a novice concept at the time. Amidst the transitions he underwent in terms of his career, Williams grew concerned that his name was too popular, fearing that people might not be able to distinguish him among so many. Therefore, in June 1917 he had his name legally changed from Charles Williams to Whiting Williams. In 1918, Williams moved to industrial world, to become Vice President and Personnel Director of Cleveland Hydraulic Pressed Steel Co. Later career (1918-1960) Williams took a leave of absence in 1920 to study working conditions and workers' attitudes firsthand, first in the United States, and later in various countries.\\"Whiting Williams, Noted Authority on Labor and Management Problems and Attitudes, Lectures on 'Why Men Work',\\" Harvard Crimson, March 26, 1932 (accessed August 29, 2013) Speaking multiple languages, French, German, Spanish, and Italian, enabled Williams to work as laborer in coal mines, railroad shops, shipyards, and oil refineries in the U.S., Europe, and Central and South America. Based on his research, he gave lectures and wrote several books such as; What's on the Worker's Mind (1920),Williams, Whiting. What's on the Worker's Mind, Scribner's sons, 1920. Full Up and Fed Up (1921), Horny Hands and Hampered Elbows (1922), and Mainsprings of Men (1925). Based on his work as a common laborer in the steel mills and in a rolling mill, as a coal miner in two towns, as a shipbuilder, as an oil man in a refinery, and as a worker in the iron mines, Williams wrote a 1920 book entitled \\"What's on the Worker's Mind, subtitled By One Who Put On Overalls To Find Out. Much of these experiences are presented in a journal-like format throughout the book. In the preface, Williams argues that \\"the daily job as the axle of the entire world\\". The book is divided into two parts; part 1 \\"Overalls\\" and part 2 \\"Findings.\\" In part 1, these topics are explored within the following chapters: \\"Hunting a Job\\", \\"In a Ten-Thousand-Man-Power Steel Plant\\", \\"In a Rolling-Mill\\", \\"Steel Slow-Miner's Wanted\\", \\"A Second Coal Town\\", \\"The Circle of the Hiring Gates\\", \\"With the Builders of Ships\\", \\"In an Oil Refinery\\", \\"In The Iron Mines\\", and \\"Among the Ignonts and Billets Again\\". The latter portion, \\"Findings,\\" includes \\"Some Outstanding Impressions\\", \\"Some Deeper Factors\\", \\"The Way Out- and Management\\", and \\"The Way Out and The Public.\\" While conducting his research, Williams adopted the idea that \\"no half measures in the manner of disguise.\\" Moreover, he presented himself with \\"a different name, a slim pocketbook, rough clothes, an unshaven face and a grammerless lingo\\". He claimed that his research \\"cheated no employer\\" as he worked tirelessly in order to derive the ruptured relations between \\"Labor, Management, and the Public -- the investors in brawn, brains, and bullion, and the bourgeoisie\\". Williams refrained from including any explicit details about companies within his book, including their geographic locations \\"because neither commendation nor criticism of communities or companies is intended or desired\\". Surprisingly, Williams did not offer conclusions or prescriptions but pointed out the most prominent concern among workers: terrible foremen. Williams transformed his approach in 1931 from working for a single company or client to sending reports on labor conditions to a number of industrialists as a mass news service. These reports often considered the way in which management could placate industrial unrest and avoid other struggles within the workplace. Williams argued for an increased emphasis on individualism and consistently and vigorously opposed the New Deal and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in the following years. At the same time, he gained national fame as a respected lecturer. The groups he addressed varied in size from the local Rotary clubs to business conferences and graduate business schools. Williams was a consultant on labor relations, personnel management, and public relations for several large businesses and spent the duration of his career lecturing about his experiences for several graduate schools including Harvard, Dartmouth, and Case Western Reserve University, until he retired at age 90. In 1940, he became a member of the National Panel of Arbitrators. In addition, he was a member of the Cosmos Club in Washington, D.C. as well as the Union Club of Cleveland. Meanwhile in Cleveland, he was a trustee of both Hiram House and the School of Art. All the while, Williams continued writing articles. Williams continued working into the 1960s, the ninth decade of his life. He was the subject of a biography by Daniel Wren in 1987.Wren, Daniel A., White Collar Hobo: The Travels of Whiting Williams (1987) His collected papers are in the Western Reserve Historical Society. Personal life Williams married Caroline Harter in 1906. They had two children, Carol R. and Harter Whiting. Williams faced two major tragedies in his personal life. In 1932 his daughter Carol, who was a talented musician, was killed in a mysterious explosion in Cleveland Heights. Soon thereafter, in 1938 his wife, Caroline, died. Williams found strength in his son, Harter, and married Dorothy Rogers in September 1941. Williams was buried in Shelby, OH.

Arsenal Football Club is an English professional association football club based in Holloway, London. The club was formed in Woolwich in 1886 as Royal Arsenal before it was renamed Woolwich Arsenal in 1893. They became the first southern member admitted into the Football League in 1893, having spent their first four seasons solely participating in cup tournaments and friendlies. The club's name was shortened to Arsenal in 1914, a year after moving to Highbury. In spite of finishing fifth in the Second Division in 1915, Arsenal rejoined the First Division at the expense of local rivals Tottenham Hotspur when football resumed after the First World War. Since that time, they have not fallen below the first tier of the English football league system and hold the record for the longest uninterrupted period in the top flight. The club remained in the Football League until 1992, when its First Division was superseded as English football's top level by the newly formed Premier League, of which they were an inaugural member. In 2003‚Äì04, Arsenal completed a league season without a single defeat, something achieved only once before in English football, by Preston North End in 1888‚Äì89. Arsenal's first team have competed in a number of national, and in the early part of the club's history, regionally contested leagues such as the United League, the Southern District Combination and the London League Premier Division.

It began with reports on the Periodismo para todos television program on the results of its investigation, led by journalist Jorge Lanata. Embezzlement and an associated money trail involved Argentine presidents N√©stor Kirchner, Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner and their employee, businessman L√°zaro B√°ez. The investigation concluded that B√°ez diverted money intended for public infrastructure to tax havens. The scandal led to an official investigation. To date no judicial investigation ever found any proof of wrongdoing by N√©stor or Cristina Kirchner. However, in April 2016 L√°zaro Baez was awaiting trial on corruption charges in an Argentinian federal prison. Development Television Jorge Lanata in 2019; Periodismo para todos host Periodismo para todos began its 2013 season on April 14. Jorge Lanata reported that according to the tax return N√©stor Kirchner sent to the AFIP, the Argentine revenue-collection agency, he and wife Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner had personal wealth of US$1.4 million when he became president in 2003. She was elected president four years later; when N√©stor Kirchner died in 2010, their assets were US$14.1 million. Lanata said that there was also a large amount of undeclared money. The first program included interviews with Leonardo Fari√±a and Federico Elaskar, who detailed methods used by L√°zaro B√°ez to send ‚Ç¨55 million to tax havens. B√°ez, a businessman from Santa Cruz Province, was a close friend of N√©stor Kirchner. Fari√±a worked for B√°ez, and Elaskar headed SGI (a financial firm used for money laundering). Elaskar detailed operations at La Rosadita, a firm in the Madero Center building in Puerto Madero. La Rosadita channeled money from Santa Cruz to Uruguay and Uruguay to Switzerland, in ‚Ç¨1.5-million increments via shell corporations. Elaskar revealed more than 50 financial firms used for similar transactions; the operation required collaboration by banks as well. Fabi√°n Rossi, husband of actress Iliana Calabr√≥, was accused of managing financial operations in Panama. Fari√±a and Elaskar later recanted their statements. Fari√±a said on the TV program Intrusos en el espect√°culo that he knew that he was being filmed, he lied to Lanata and he never carried bags of money. Elaskar said that he lied to harm Fari√±a. Gossip shows on state-sponsored TV channels called it the \\"Fari√±a-Rossi case\\", focusing on the impact on the television personalities, ignoring ties to B√°ez and Kirchner and downplaying the corruption charges. Rossi said that Fari√±a and Elaskar were deluded. Eduardo Arnold, vice-governor of Santa Cruz during N√©stor Kirchner's presidency, said on the TV program La cornisa that in 2001 Cristina Kirchner showed him a vault in her home in El Calafate for the family's savings; Arnold suspected that the vault, larger than a home safe, confirmed the alleged money laundering. In later programs, Lanata presented more evidence for the allegations. The second episode focused on the relationship between B√°ez and the Kirchners. Lanata documented agreements between B√°ez and N√©stor Kirchner authorizing a builder, Austral Construcciones (owned by B√°ez), to build apartments on land owned by Kirchner. These documents had already been sent to the courts by deputy Elisa Carri√≥, who alleged illegal collaboration by B√°ez, Kirchner and minister Julio de Vido. Lanata also detailed unusual growth in B√°ez's finances since the beginning of the Kirchner presidencies, and favoritism toward Austral Construcciones in the awarding of the majority of public contracts in the province. According to the Swiss bank Teegan, a shell corporation wholly owned by L√°zaro B√°ez's son Mart√≠n, transferred $1.5 million . Jorge Harguindeguy, former Argentine ambassador to Panama, confirmed the Panamanian operations of La Rosadita. Travel records obtained by La Naci√≥n indicate that Fari√±a, Rossi, Mart√≠n B√°ez and Daniel P√©rez Gad√≠n (B√°ez's accountant) all visited Panama, often at the same time. Fari√±a flew from Uruguay to Panama on the official plane of Chaco Province, governed by Kirchner supporter Jorge Capitanich. On April 28, Lanata detailed links between minister Julio de Vido, Kirchner and B√°ez. De Vido allegedly requested bribes for B√°ez. Estela Kank, former owner of Kank y Costilla, described collusion by De Vido and B√°ez to force her to sell her company to B√°ez. Sergio Acevedo, former governor of Santa Cruz, said that Kirchner demanded an increase of over 300% in B√°ez's monthly public-works budget. Acevedo made similar accusations against the Kirchners in 2009, saying that public works in the province were always performed by firms associated with B√°ez. Lanata aired an interview with Miriam Quiroga, N√©stor Kirchner's secretary, who described people moving full bags of money from the Casa Rosada and the Quinta de Olivos to El Calafate (Kirchner's hometown) with the Tango 01 presidential aircraft. When later, in 2015, Quiroga was questioned by Judge Luis Rodr√≠guez she confessed that these were false allegations intended to promote a book on the subject co-authored with her husband. In the 2014 Lanata's interview with Quiroga, she alleged Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner was aware of the operations; although she could not confirm the existence of a vault at the Kirchners' house, what she overheard made her suspect that it was likely. Former prosecutor Andr√©s Vivanco said that B√°ez's wealth is actually N√©stor Kirchner's. He described two other vaults in R√≠o Gallegos: one belonging to Cristina Kirchner, the other to B√°ez. The May 12 program included an interview with Antonio Ca√±as, the Kirchners' architect, who described the existence and location of a safe in their house's architectural plan. On May 19, Lanata made further accusations of money laundering against N√©stor Kirchner, his son M√°ximo, L√°zaro B√°ez and sports agent Miguel √Ångel Pires involving the acquisition of soccer players (including Rub√©n Ram√≠rez, Pablo Lug√ºercio, Marcos C√°ceres, Nicol√°s Cabrera, Leandro Gonz√°lez and Mart√≠n Wagner) for Racing Club de Avellaneda. Elisa Carri√≥ accused B√°ez of removing evidence from a vault at his house, and a witness who helped empty the vault had photos and bags. At a press conference at his house, B√°ez showed reporters a wine cellar at the location of the alleged vault. Carri√≥ replied that the photos showed both the wine cellar and the vault, and the wine cellar shown by B√°ez was next to a freshly-painted wall. Lanata aired the photos, explaining how B√°ez could have emptied the vault and prepared the area for invited journalists. A search and seizure took place at Madero Center several days after the first program. On June 16, Lanata aired security-camera tapes showing the removal of boxes, papers and file folders on April 12 at 14:20 (two days before the first program aired) and April 18 at 16:22 (hours before the search and seizure). La Naci√≥n exposed a business connection between President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner and L√°zaro B√°ez: they co-owned an plot of land outside El Calafate. She bought a half-share in 2006 and in turn sold it to B√°ez in 2008. B√°ez built a road and a luxury hotel; he paid rent for one-third of the rooms (even if they were empty), channeling public money to the Kirchners. Several politicians criticized the conflict of interest; deputies Patricia Bullrich and Laura Alonso asked the anticorruption office to investigate the situation, and Elisa Carri√≥ and Mariana Zuvic asked to add this information to ongoing investigations. On August 18 Lanata said that according to official reports, Cristina Kirchner visited the Seychelles on January 21 and 22, although there was no record of presidential activities on those days. The islands were mentioned by Elaskar as a fiscal destination. Several months after her visit, Seychelles no longer met the criteria for tax havens. Lanata also said that N√©stor Kirchner created a shell subsidiary of his Panamanian corporation in Ireland. Oscar Parrilli said that Cristina Kirchner's stay in Seychelles was 13 hours rather than two days, and criticized Lanata for blindly accepting official information. Parrilli called Lanata a hitman and Grupo Clar√≠n a threat to democracy. In return, Lanata sued Parrilli for harassment. Lanata aired an interview with Venezuelan journalist Nella De Luca, who was at Kirchner's hotel and confirmed her presence. Horacio Quiroga, a former businessman associated with B√°ez, described links from B√°ez and N√©stor Kirchner to Lanata and the magazine Noticias. Quiroga and B√°ez worked for the oil firms Epsur and Mishar, and were visited by an agent for Kirchner; his testimony was included in the court case. In January 2019, information emerged about Patricia Bullrich, Minister of Security of Mauricio Macri's administration, paying ARS 200,000 to Fari√±a \\"for information that would implicate people linked to the Kirchner's management.\\" Judiciary Deputy Elisa Carri√≥ filed a court case. Several politicians petitioned the courts after the first program was aired. Deputy Elisa Carri√≥ filed a case with judge Juli√°n Ercolini, who was already investigating L√°zaro B√°ez for conspiracy. Ercolini gave Carri√≥'s case to a Kirchner supporter, judge Sebasti√°n Casanello. Prosecutor Guillermo Marijuan began an investigation; attorney Alejandro S√°nchez Kalbermatten filed a similar case against L√°zaro B√°ez, his sons Mart√≠n B√°ez and Leandro B√°ez, Daniel P√©rez Gad√≠n and Fabi√°n Rossi after Carrio's, but before her case was given to Casanello. The prosecutor was Miguel √Ångel Osorio. Attorney Ricardo Monner Sans and deputies Manuel Garrido and Graciela Oca√±a filed additional cases. Since the cases were similar, President of the Federal Chamber Mart√≠n Irurzun had to decide which judge would preside. Canicoba Corral rejected the case and sent it to Casanello, who sent it to the Federal Chamber; Casanello was finally confirmed as judge. Canicoba Corral roled that although a hidden camera may be acceptable as proof in investigative journalism, it is inadmissible in court, adding that he had not analyzed the case and had no opinion. Argentine case law does not accept hidden cameras as proof of crime, since they constitute self-incrimination. However, they are admissible when witnesses have conflicting testimony; an unedited film may clarify which witness is more accurate. Prosecutors Ramiro Gonz√°lez and Carlos Gonella asked Casanello for an investigation of Fari√±a and Elaskar when he was confirmed as judge. Their initial request did not mention L√°zaro B√°ez or the Kirchners, but was open to expansion. The prosecutors requested unedited copies of both films aired by Periodismo para todos and the later TV programs, where Fari√±a and Elaskar said that they had lied. Jorge Lanata gave his testimony to the prosecutor Jos√© Mar√≠a Campagnoli on April 22. Senator Mario Cimadevilla of the Radical Civic Union criticized Gils Carb√≥ for the appointment of prosecutors, including Gonella, without Senate approval. Carb√≥ streamlined the appointment system, and the charges against him were dropped ten days later. Guillermo Marijuan appealed this, saying that he had received death threats against his daughters and was receiving protection. Campagnoli mentioned that the AFIP, IGJ and Migrations refused to give him information. Fari√±a and Elaskar presented their testimony on June 10. Elaskar said that Lanata had scripted what he said on television, and denied any personal relationship with B√°ez. He also denied being coerced to sell his company (which he had said on TV) and said that the shell-corporation documents were forged by Lanata. Elaskar refused to reveal whether or not he had assets abroad, and said that he did not remember details about the sale of his firm. Fari√±a said that he had received $70,000 working for a man close to B√°ez, in addition to payment for his wife's artwork. He denied transporting bags of money, saying that he visited Uruguay and Mexico as a tourist. But, he acknowledged working for B√°ez at Austral Construcciones. Since the income detailed by Fari√±a was insufficient for his lifestyle, Casanello broadened his investigation. Carri√≥ provided photos and a witness to the emptying of a vault at B√°ez's house in Santa Cruz; Casanello gave the witness protection, and proposed to send the case to the judiciary of the Santa Cruz province. Marijuan, however, thought it should be incorporated into the existing case. His appeal was received by the Federal Chamber and upheld by judges Horacio Cattani, Mart√≠n Irurzun and Eduardo Farah. Casanello ordered a search of Baez's house, including his safes. The investigation, 15 days after the accusation, was fruitless. Casanello also ordered a search of the walls, to determine if there had been a vault. The judge closed the cause after concluding that there never existed at L√°zaro B√°ez's farm house the vaults that Lanata's TV report denounced as the storage of money related to its own accusations. B√°ez' lawyers asked Campagnoli to recuse the prosecutor, claiming that his sister was affiliated with the Civic Coalition Carri√≥ led. Carb√≥ accused him of abuse of authority and infringing on other prosecutors' jurisdictions. Campagnoli replied that he was just doing his job, and was supported by prosecutors' organizations. =Related cases= There was no immediate search and seizure as a result of the first program. Although five cases were heard by two judges at that point, any judge could have secured potential evidence without waiting for the combining of the cases. Opposition parties criticized the lack of immediate action, attributing it to government- appointed chief of prosecutors Alejandra Gils Carb√≥. Several neighbours reported on April 17 that documentation was removed from the Madero Center (the alleged location of La Rosadita) over a several-hour period; a search and seizure was conducted the following day. Casanello requisitioned security- camera tapes to ascertain if documents were removed before the operation, and the investigation suggested that information may have been erased from computers between the first program and the search-and-seizure operation. It was discovered that Austral Construcciones (owned by L√°zaro B√°ez and operating with large sums of money) was a client of La Rosadita and its telephones had B√°ez on speed dial. The son of Daniel P√©rez Gad√≠n (B√°ez's accountant) was identified in the security tapes as one of the men removing papers, boxes and file folders before the search and seizure; Casanello opened a separate investigation. Still not charged, B√°ez sued Fari√±a and Elaskar for defamation and subpoenaed Jorge Rial and Luis Ventura (hosts of Intrusos...) as witnesses. Fari√±a's suit was heard by judge Ra√∫l Garc√≠a, and Elaskar's by judge Fernando Pigni. Garc√≠a dismissed the suit. Prosecutor Guillermo Marijuan extended the investigation on May 4 to L√°zaro B√°ez, his son Mart√≠n, B√°ez's accountant Daniel P√©rez Gad√≠n and Fabi√°n Rossi. He criticized Gonella for not including them in the original case, and for investigating Fari√±a and Elaskar only when the case made the news. Legislator Julio Raffo, from Proyecto Sur, accused public official Gonella of nonfeasance in office. Elisa Carri√≥ said that Miriam Quiroga's testimony was similar to her 2008 reports during an ongoing corruption case against N√©stor Kirchner, B√°ez, Julio De Vido, Carlos Zannini, Ricardo Jaime, Claudio Uberti and Rudy Ulloa, and hoped that judge Juli√°n Ercollini would expedite the case. Quiroga's testimony was heard by judge Juli√°n Ercolini. She testified that Kirchner instructed Rudy Ulloa and Cristobal L√≥pez to buy media and how to manage public works, but did not remember details. Quiroga was not asked about the bags of money she mentioned in Lanata's program because it concerned a different case; that testimony will be heard by judge Luis Rodr√≠guez. Daniel Mu√±oz, Kirchner's former secretary, was accused by prosecutor Ramiro Gonz√°lez of involvement in the conspiracy. Pablo Senyszyn, N√©stor Kirchner's bodyguard, denied seeing money bags and said that any bags would have been detected by security; he was suspended and replaced by Claudia Katok and Cristina Caama√±o. International response The Uruguayan Air Force and Uruaguayan customs began an informal investigation of the Uruguayan link. Elaskar testified that Fari√±a sent the bags of money to Uruguayan financial companies, which in turn sent them to Switzerland. The Uruguayans investigated whether the flights were destined to Carrasco and whether the dates and crews matched. Deputy Juan Manuel Garino called for an investigation of a possible security breach at Uruguayan airports. Ministers Fernando Lorenzo and Eleuterio Fern√°ndez Huidobro addressed the Uruguayan Congress, describing controls on money laundering. Uruguayan President Jos√© Mujica said that such banking operations would not go unnoticed in his country, but acknowledged that money may have been smuggled; the minister of defense revealed the existence of more than 900 unregulated airports. The Uruguayan case was conducted by judge Mart√≠n Gesto and prosecutor Jos√© G√≥mez, with Interpol support. Before the Uruguayan Congress, judge N√©stor Valetti criticized a lack of Argentine co-operation. Argentine deputy Graciela Oca√±a accused the chancellery of blocking communications between the countries. As of January 2014, the investigation was stalled. The Swiss courts began their own investigation with information from Argentine deputies Garrido and Oca√±a; however, Switzerland required input from the Argentine judiciary to pursue the case. Le Matin and Tages-Anzeiger reported the ongoing Argentine controversy, and public opinion opposed illicit money in Swiss banks. However, the Swiss case is not directly related to the Argentine one. Casanello and prosecutor Marijuan were invited to Switzerland to confer with local judges, but their trip was cancelled. Casanello formally requested information about Teegan from the Panamanian courts. Since B√°ez has at least six companies in Florida, Elisa Carri√≥ informed local prosecutors and American legislator Carl Levin (a money- laundering expert) about the case. Reactions Demonstration in support of Jos√© Mar√≠a Campagnoli. Initially, the government had no comment about the controversy. Only deputy Carlos Kunkel said that although he did not know L√°zaro B√°ez, if he committed a crime he had to go to prison; however, he thought there was insufficient evidence. Governor of Santa Cruz province Daniel Peralta denied any connection to B√°ez, saying that public works in the province were financed by the national government since 2008 through Vialidad Nacional. Once a Kirchner supporter, Peralta had turned to Federal Peronism. He said that the national government had invested $770 million in public works from 2007 to 2012, and that control of such finances was the purview of the SIGEN. Minister Julio de Vido considered the scandal an attempt to halt construction of the dams N√©stor Kirchner and Jorge Cepernic Dams. B√°ez, in a news conference where he took no questions, considered it an attempt to defame N√©stor Kirchner; he questioned Fari√±a and Elaskar's reliability and the authenticity of the documents shown on the program. Since Leonardo Fari√±a was the husband of television personality Karina Jelinek, the government tried to treat the program's revelations as a dispute between TV presenters on its controlled TV channels to discredit it. It hoped focusing Fari√±a would deflect attention from Kirchner. This attempt failed, and the extended coverage increased awareness of the controversy among the apolitical population. Details of the money's being weighed (instead of counted) and politicians' home vaults increased lay understanding of the corruption controversy's scope.Mendelevich, p. 158 Public interest in the controversy resembled that in a telenovela; a large portion of the population awaited each new airing of Periodismo para todos, and its revelations were discussed during the week. A survey concerning the controversy found that 80% of the respondents followed it, 70% thought the accusations were true and 65% thought it affected the president's public image. Two-thirds of the respondents agreed that the level of corruption during the Kirchner presidencies was similar (or higher) than that during the presidency of Carlos Menem. Public reception of the controversy may have been influenced by the ongoing Argentine economic crisis, the suspicion of presidential involvement and Lanata's persuasiveness. National deputy Andr√©s Larroque considered the scandal a veiled coup attempt by the media. Writer Ricardo Forster minimized the significance of political corruption, considering interest in it by the media a threat to democracy. Presidential secretary Oscar Parrilli accused media groups of attempting to generate terrorism against the Kirchner presidencies. Presidential undersecretary Gustavo L√≥pez said that the scandal was caused by corporate group warfare against the government. Alleged threats to democracy and allegations of coup attempts are a common element of Kirchnerite criticism of political opposition since the 2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector.Mendelevich, p. 106-108 The government tried to shrink the audience for Periodismo para todos by rescheduling the most-important soccer match of the week against it. The tactic was unsuccessful; Lanata received 24.7 rating points, compared with 16 for the Boca-Newell's Old Boys match. Journalist Jorge Fern√°ndez D√≠az said that soccer matches had not been scheduled so late the previous year, when Periodismo para todos had an average of 15 ratings points instead of 25. The June 16 match between River Plate and Lan√∫s violated an Argentine Football Association rule requiring the last two matches of teams with chances to win a tournament to be played concurrently. Although L√°zaro B√°ez intended to run for governor of Santa Cruz province in 2015, as of April 2013 he engaged in no political activity in the Justicialist Party or the Front for Victory.

This was the same day as the other 2003 United Kingdom local elections. One third of the seats were up for election and the council stayed under no overall control. Background Before the election the Conservatives were the largest party with 24 seats, the Liberal Democrats had 23 seats, Labour had 4 seats, there were 8 independents and 1 seat was vacant after the sitting Labour councillor moved to Scotland. The council was run by a cabinet comprising 3 Conservatives, 3 Liberal Democrats and 1 Labour members. 21 seats were being contested, with 2 seats available in Wivenhoe Cross due to the vacancy. The remaining 20 seats all had the sitting councillors defending their seats and included the Labour group leader Tim Young in St Andrew's and the Conservative mayor Nigel Chapman in Fordham and Stour. Meanwhile, in High Woods, Ian Ringer, defended the seat as an independent after leaving the Liberal Democrats earlier in 2003. Election result Prior to the election, 3 Liberal Democrat councillors from Highwoods ward defected and sat as Independents, reducing the Liberal Democrat group to 23 councillors. Following the election Bob Newman left the Labour group to sit as an independent, reducing Labour to 4 councillors. Labour then went into opposition after refusing to work with the Conservatives and a new cabinet was formed with 4 Conservative and 4 Liberal Democrat members.

The scanning laser vibrometer or scanning laser Doppler vibrometer, was first developed by the British loudspeaker company, Celestion, around 1979,G. Bank and G.T. Hathaway ‚ÄúA revolutionary interferometric vibrational mode display‚Äù presented at the 66th Convention of the AES, Preprint 1658, 1980. further developed in the 1980s,Stoffregen, B., Felske, A., ‚ÄúScanning Laser Doppler Analysis System,‚Äù SAE Paper No. 850327, 1985. and commercially introduced by Ometron, Ltd around 1986. It is an instrument for rapid non-contact measurement and imaging of vibration. Fields where they are applied include automotive, medical, aerospace, micro system and information technology as well as for quality and production control. The optimization of vibration and acoustic behavior are important goals of product development in all of these fields because they are often among the key characteristics that determine a product's success in the market. They are also in widespread use throughout many universities conducting basic and applied research in areas that include structural dynamics, modal analysis, acoustic optimization and non-destructive evaluation. The operating principle is based on the Doppler effect, which occurs when light is back-scattered from a vibrating surface. Both velocity and displacement can be determined by analyzing the optical signals in different ways. A scanning laser vibrometer integrates computer-controlled X,Y scanning mirrors and a video camera inside an optical head. The laser is scanned point-by-point over the test object's surface to provide a large number of very high spatial resolution measurements. This sequentially measured vibration data can be used to calculate and visualize animated deflection shapes in the relevant frequency bands from frequency domain analysis. Alternatively, data can be acquired in the time domain to, for example, generate animations showing wave propagation across structures. In contrast to contact measuring methods, the test object is unaffected by the vibration measuring process. Vibrometry covers a huge range of applications such as the study of microstructures moving only a few pm at frequencies up to 30 MHz, all the way up to the intense dynamics occurring in Formula 1 engines with vibration velocities approaching 30 m/s. A 3D scanning vibrometer combines three optical sensors that accurately detect dynamic movement from different directions in space in order to completely determine the 3D vectors of motion. The software allows each individual x-, y- or z-direction component to be displayed independently, or combined into a single representation. Data can be exported for finite element model validation at nodes previously imported from the model for scan grid definition.

Following the PC-12 single turboprop success, work on the jet started in 2007 for greater range and speed, keeping the rugged airfield capability. The aircraft was introduced on 21 May 2013 and rolled out on 1 August 2014, with the maiden flight on 11 May 2015. The PC-24 received EASA and FAA type certification on 7 December 2017 and the first customer delivery was on 7 February 2018. Powered by two Williams FJ44 turbofans, it competes with the Embraer Phenom 300 and the Cessna Citation CJ4. Development PC-24 prototype during its roll-out ceremony on 1 August 2014. During the 1990s, Pilatus Aircraft had brought to market the Pilatus PC-12, a single-engine turboprop-powered business aircraft. As the PC-12 quickly proved to be a commercial success, Pilatus sought to follow up with a complementary aircraft and began gathering feedback from customers of the type. In response to this request, several customers reportedly expressed a desire for an aircraft that would possess both a greater range and top speed than the existing PC-12, while retaining the type's overall ruggedness and ability to make use of very short runways. Based on this feedback, Pilatus elected to pursue development of such an aircraft. In 2007, Pilatus initiated work on the program. Development of the aircraft was conducted using existing company funds. The design program was first mentioned by Pilatus in its May 2011 annual report. On 21 May 2013, the PC-24 was introduced to the public at the European Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (EBACE) in Geneva. At the time, Pilatus chairman Oscar Schwenk claimed the PC-24 did not fit into any existing business jet categories, and stated that the aircraft was the only one that combined \\"...the versatility of a turboprop with the cabin size of a medium light jet, and the performance of a light jet\\". On 1 August 2014, which is also Switzerland's national day, P01, the first of the three PC-24 prototypes, was rolled out.Perry, Dominic. \\"PICTURES: Pilatus PC-24 is rolled out at Stans ceremony.\\" Flight International, 2 August 2014. Each of these three prototypes serve different functions in the development program; P01 is intended for exploring the flight envelope of the type, P02 is mainly for trialling the avionics and autopilot integration, and will spend much of its testing life in the US, while P03 is to be representative of production aircraft and will incorporate improvements made based upon the development work performed with the other two aircraft. Flight testing The first flight of the prototype had been originally anticipated to take place in late 2014, but this was delayed. On 11 May 2015, P01 conducted its first flight from Buochs Airport, Switzerland, for a total of 55 minutes. The occasion marked the start of test flights for the aircraft's two-year certification campaign.Sarsfield, Kate. \\"VIDEO: Pilatus PC-24 'super versatile jet' takes to the skies.\\" Flight International, 11 May 2015. At the time, type certification and initial deliveries were anticipated for 2017. On 16 November 2015, P02, the second prototype, performed its maiden flight, lasting for 82 minutes; by this date, P01 had accumulated a total of 150 flying hours and had performed over 100 flights.Huber, Mark. \\"Second Pilatus PC-24 Flies.\\" AIN Online, 17 November 2015.Sarsfield, Kate. \\"NBAA: Pilatus marks flight of second PC-24 and upgrades PC-12NG.\\" Flight International, 16 November 2015. In May 2016, P01 took an brief intermission in the test program to appear on static display at EBACE; by this point, P01 and P02 had accumulated more than 500 flight hours between them.Alcock, Charles. \\"Certification-chasing PC-24 Does EBACE Touch and Go.\\" AIN Online, 24 May 2016. During EBACE 2016, it was commented that the program was on track and test flights had been free of surprises; during a transatlantic crossing to the US, P02 had achieved a cruise speed in excess of 800 km/h (432 kt.), which was better than expected. The PC-24 flight-test fleet was completed with the addition of the third prototype of P03 in March 2017; by May they had logged 950 flights and 1,525 hours. In August 2017, Williams International received type and production certification from the EASA and FAA for its FJ44-4A-QPM while the three test aircraft accumulated over 1,700h of flight tests, on schedule for certification and introduction in the fourth quarter. By October 2017, more than 2,000 hours had been flown, with the P01 prototype flying 626 times and 900 hours. The P03 prototype will complete a functional and reliability program, including 150 hours over six weeks before certification is completed and initial deliveries commence. Type certification was granted on 7 December 2017, as placarded at the April 2018 AERO Friedrichshafen. The three prototypes flew 2205 hours including icing conditions and very hot temperatures, outside its flight envelope, bird strikes, structural stress tests and noise tests before it received EASA and FAA type certification on 7 December 2017. Its performance goals were met or exceeded, like its maximum speed raised from 425 to 440 knots (787 to 815 km/h). In the fourth quarter of 2018,the aircraft was certified to land on dry sand and gravel. Australian RFDS will start medevac in 2019. Transport Canada certification was awarded on 27 June 2019. On February 2020, the design was approved for rough field operation, certifying the aircraft to operate from grass, wet earth and snow-covered surfaces, following a multiyear certification campaign. As of February 2020, the aircraft can operate from grass, wet earth, dry sand, gravel and snow. Production In late 2014, an agreement between Pilatus and FlightSafety International will see the latter conduct US-based PC-24 pilot and technician training in Dallas, Texas. In May 2017, series production was under way for a fourth quarter first delivery to PlaneSense, following certification. In December 2017, eight PC-24s were on the assembly line and 23 deliveries were planned for 2018. The first customer delivery was completed on 7 February 2018 to PlaneSense. In 2018, 23 to 24 are planned for delivery, with 40 planned for 2019 and then 50 per year. On 11 October 2018, its MTOW was raised from , from the 31st serial aircraft produced, while its zero-fuel weight (empty weight plus payload) grew by . Orders and deliveries At the May 2014 EBACE, Pilatus sold the initial production run of 84 units 36 hours after orders opened. This first batch of orders is to be delivered until early 2020. Orders were to reopen after publishing the aircraft's final performance data and assessing operators' feedback. Throughout its 40-year lifecycle, Pilatus plan to produce 4,000 units. A PC-24 was ordered to transport the Swiss Federal Council. When it was certified in December 2017, it was priced at US$8.9M. On 26 November 2018, the first of five was delivered to the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia, supplementing its 35 PC-12s single turboprops. Unpaved and short 856m (2,810 ft) runways should be allowed next, and it should enter service in early 2019 as an air ambulance with three beds and an electric stretcher loader. They feature individual oxygen, vacuum and power systems for patient monitoring and support installed under a supplemental type certificate by aircraft medical interiors specialist Aerolite AG, for $13 million complete each. It will replace a midsize Hawker 800XP operated in Western Australia since 2009, a gravel kit will be available by the end of the year, and Pilatus is working on operating on narrow runways, from . In May 2019, the PC-24 orderbook was reopened at the EBACE show, with about 80 delivery positions made available at a price of $10.7 million each, for late 2020 and 2021 deliveries. Of these new positions half were sold within days. Pilatus intends to deliver 40 aircraft in 2019 and 50 in 2020. Pilatus had already delivered more than 30 aircraft by May 2019 and the first had logged over 1,100 hours, during its first 15 months of operation. The PC-24 was also granted European and US steep approach certification, including for London City airport's 5.5¬∞ approach and short runway, plus dirt and gravel runway operations. Certification for other surfaces, including grass is to follow. Rough-field certification was approved for grass, wet earth and snow operations in late January 2020. Design Viewed from below, showing moderate wing sweep with a straight trailing edge and exposed wheels. The PC-24 is the company's first jet-powered aircraft. Several competing business aircraft were identified early on, including Embraer's Phenom 300 and Cessna's Citation CJ4. It is a low-wing cantilever cabin monoplane powered by two Williams FJ44-4A turbofans, each mounted in a nacelle on the side of the rear fuselage. It has a T-tail and a retractable tricycle landing gear. The aircraft is designed to operate from short and rough airstrips and incorporates an advanced wing design, with a large double- slotted flap system to achieve the necessary performance, having a stall speed of only 81 knots at the maximum landing weight. The long-stroke trailing link landing gear smooths out uneven surfaces, the dual-wheel main wheels have of pressure to prevent sinking in soft surfaces, and the wing flaps have a replaceable, abradable surface and shields the high mounted engines from loose debris. The cabin has room for eight passengers and two pilots. The cabin has three exits, a passenger door on the left-hand side near the front, two overwing emergency exits and a cargo door on the left-hand side at the rear. Pilatus claims the PC-24 is the first business jet to be fitted with this standard pallet-sized cargo door.\\"Cargo.\\" Pilatus Aircraft, Retrieved: 4 June 2016.. The interior color schemes of the PC-24 have been designed by BMW Designworks; interiors for the Americas are to be completed at a facility in Broomfield, Colorado, which will be expanded by 50% to cope with the extra demand. Pilatus and Honeywell cooperatively designed the Advanced Cockpit Environment for the type. This is intended to reduce pilot workload and allows the PC-24 to be single-pilot certified. The avionics system is based on Honeywell Primus Epic 2. At and , total fuel flow is per hour at M0.65 long range cruise or , raising to /h at its M0.74 high-speed cruise.

Although the defect is normally fatal, occasional cases have been reported of long-term survival following surgical intervention. The disease was first described in 1900 by Payne. To this date, it is estimated that about 200 cases have been reported and published worldwide. Several types of the disease have been described and the slight anatomical variations have resulted in the establishment of different classification systems. There are three main types of tracheal agenesis, designated Types I, II and III. In 2013, a case was reported of a South Korean child with tracheal agenesis who had been successfully treated after having been kept alive in an intensive care unit for the first two and a half years of her life. She then had an artificially created trachea implanted that had been created by tissue engineering using her own stem cells. The patient however later died from complications. The disease has been more frequently observed in males than in females, at a ratio of 2:1. Signs and symptoms Observable signs and symptoms of the disease differ depending on whether the observation in done in utero or after parturition. Only the signs and symptoms of the embryo are described, due to the lack of research in maternal symptoms. In utero 277x277px The classic in-utero symptoms of tracheal agenesis are an absence of the trachea leading to congenital high airway obstruction syndrome, lung distention, polyhydramnios, heart malformations, heart displacement and hydrops fetalis. Other congenital malformations such as genitourinary, gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal anomalies are common and occur in 80% of the reported cases. Tracheal agenesis may lead to a distention of the foetus‚Äô lung due to a build- up of pulmonary fluid within them. In this case, ultrasound scans show bilaterally enlarged and homogeneously echogenic lungs as well as the inversion of both hemidiaphragms. Although lung distention has been described as a classic symptom, hypoplasia or complete aplasia of the lungs can also occur, in an estimated 26% of cases. In some cases, normal lung development was also reported in neonates with tracheal agenesis. The abnormal development of the foetus‚Äô lungs leads to cardiovascular abnormalities. Distention of the lungs results in a compressed and displaced heart, hindering the normal growth and development of the organ. Depending on the severity of the compression of the heart, normal venous return to the organ would correspondingly be hindered, resulting in a condition known as hydrops fetalis (also known as fetalis ascites), in which oedema form in the developing foetus. Hydrops fetalis can be observed in utero via ultrasound scan. Polyhydramnios occurs in embryos presenting with a tracheoesophageal fistula as the liquid produced by the lungs supposedly pass to the stomach, in the amniotic fluid. At birth More than half of the recorded cases of tracheal agenesis have led to premature deliveries and in almost all reported cases, infants die shortly after birth due to lack of oxygenation. Neonates with tracheal agenesis present with symptoms characteristic to congenital high airway obstruction syndrome with no audible cry after birth, respiratory insufficiency, respiratory distressand cyanosis. No trachea is palpable below the cricoid cartilage. Causes The exact causes of tracheal agenesis remain unknown. Different embryological theories have arisen to explain the congenital development of the disease. Embryological causes The relative similarities between the different subtypes of the disease suggest that there is a common stage at which the development is hindered. In normal embryogenesis, the trachea differentiates from the foregut during the fourth week of gestation. The respiratory diverticulum, a ventral projection formed from the foregut, appears. Eventually, the tracheoesophageal ridges will fuse to form a septum. The laryngotracheal tube will then fully separate from the foregut. Two primary bronchial buds form at the end of the tube, which then elongates to form the trachea. The buds then branch to form the bronchi, lungs and alveolar tissue. The development of the respiratory tract is closely associated to that of the oesophagus. Both organs regulate each other‚Äôs growth via molecular interactions. In tracheal agenesis, a delay in the development of the primary bronchial buds causes a transient arrest in the growth of the laryngotracheal tube, hindering the normal development of the trachea. The failure of the lung buds to develop from the primitive foregut leads to tracheoesophageal malformations. The development of the buds occurs after the elongation of the oesophagus, causing a dissociation in the growth of the two organs. Due to this dissociation, the buds directly develop to form the lungs, without forming the trachea, resulting in tracheal agenesis. Different degrees of this malformation result in different types of tracheal agenesis. Genetic determinants No clear genetic pattern or karyotype has been established to support the development of tracheal agenesis. The genes that have been postulated to influence the development of the disease are all associated to the congenital development of the lungs, trachea and oesophagus. These are BMP-4, BMPR1A and BMPR1B, Gli2 and Gli3, sonic hedgehog and NK2 homeobox 1. It is highly likely that tracheal agenesis results from the mutation of several of these genes. BMP-4 is an important signalling molecule in the early development of the embryo. BMP-4 null mutations in the foregut endoderm and in its surrounding mesoderm results in atresia of the trachea and under developed lungs. The Bmp family restricts the site of formation of lung buds as well as to induce cell proliferation via the suppression of Sox2. Gli2 and Gli3 null mutations were also found to result in delayed lung, tracheal and oesophageal development. The two signalling molecules are implicated in the mediation of Sonic hedgehog signalling, which regulates the proliferation and differentiation of the oesophagus, trachea and lungs. In mice, NK2 homeobox 1 null mutation results in a significantly shorter trachea, connected to the oesophagus via a tracheoesophageal fistula. In embryos with a homozygous mutated NK2 homeobox 1 locus, the tracheoesophageal ridges fail to fuse and form a septum. Diagnosis The diagnosis of the disease is dependent on observable signs and symptoms and on the stage of gestation. There are two ways to diagnose tracheal agenesis: early in utero, or later at birth. Recognisable clinical patterns are associated with tracheal agenesis. Most commonly, the in-utero diagnosis of the disease requires using radiography and ultrasound scans. At birth, the diagnosis is suspected clinically through the observations of characteristic signs and symptoms of the disease. Tracheal agenesis should be suspected when tracheal intubation is impossible. The confirmation of the diagnosis relies on results of endoscopic laryngoscopies and oesophagoscopies at birth. X-ray studies are necessary to determine the class and the severity of the disease. CT scans remain an option to provide more information if required. Classification Tracheal agenesis is classified according to anatomical subtypes. Different classifications exist but the universally accepted one, by Floyd and colleagues in 1962, distinguishes three anatomical subtypes: type I, II and III. =Type I= Type I is described as tracheal atresia, rather than tracheal agenesis. The trachea is absent proximally but there remains a short normal segment of the distal trachea. A tracheoesophageal fistula links the distal segment of the proto trachea to the oesophagus. It is estimated that 13% of cases of the disease are of type I. =Type II= Type II tracheal agenesis is the most common form of the disease, estimated to appear in 60% of cases. Type II is characterised by a complete absence of the trachea. The bronchi are normal and fuse at the carina. In most cases, the oesophagus and the carina are joined by a fistula. =Type III= In type III tracheal agenesis, the trachea is completely absent and the bronchi develop individually, originating from the oesophagus directly and without joining at the carina. No tracheoesophageal fistula is present in this case as the trachea is completely absent. It is estimated that 27% of all cases are type III. =Other classifications= In 1979, Faro described seven types of tracheal agenesis (A-G). This classification system differs from Floyd‚Äôs early propositions as it encompasses a more detailed description of the disease, including the surrounding organs such as the larynx and the lungs. The importance of this more detailed classification system is that the presence of surrounding organs, such as the larynx, might alter the observed symptoms of the traditionally defined tracheal agenesis. For example, neonates with a larynx might emit a faint cry at birth, while those with complete agenesis of the trachea and of the larynx will not. Acknowledging these different anatomical subtypes allows for a more comprehensive diagnosis and better management of the disease. Faro type A describes a total pulmonary agenesis, in which none of the respiratory organs are present. Type B is comparable to Floyd‚Äôs type III and describes complete agenesis of the trachea, with no joining of the bronchi. Faro type C describes total agenesis of the trachea with normal bronchi fusing at the carina. A tracheoesophageal fistula is present and links the carina to the oesophagus. In Faro type D, the larynx is joined to the distal trachea and a tracheoesophageal fistula links the carina to the oesophagus. Faro type E is comparable to Floyd‚Äôs type I, as the distal trachea is present and joined to the oesophagus via a fistula. Faro type F describes the proximal absence of the trachea but the normal presence of the distal trachea. In this case, the trachea is not attached to the oesophagus. In Faro type G, a segment of the trachea is absent, defining it as partial tracheal agenesis. Management In patients with tracheal agenesis, surgical correction is required to allow for a relatively temporary survival of the neonate. Tracheal intubation is proven to be impossible in almost all cases. In most cases, if surgery is unsuccessful, severe asphyxia results in the death of the neonate, on average two days after birth. The longest survival ever reported was six years.

Early life and education Fairclough was born in Blackburn in 1907 and was educated at All Saints. In 1931 he secured a place at the Royal College of Art where he studied under Malcolm Osborne and Bob Austin, mastering his craft as a printmaker. He was elected an associate of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers in January 1934, winning the Prix de Rome Scholarship in Engraving. He was thus able to travel despite the Depression, working in Rome and subsequently in Spain on the eve of the civil war. In the summer of 1936 he married fellow artist, Joan Vernon Cryer. Their son, Michael was born in Blackburn in 1940. Daughter, Celia, was born at the end of the war. Career Fairclough started work at Kingston College of Art in 1938. Fairclough's work was exhibited in Poland, Finland and Sweden in 1939. He was called up for war service, joining the RAF. Fairclough was one of the ninety- seven artists that contributed to the Pilgrim Trust funded Recording Britain initiative. His contributions concentrated on buildings in locations near the Thames including Windsor, Henley, Ham and Petersham. In 1942 at RAF Medmenham he worked on models used for the Dambusters' raid on the M√∂hne Dam. He also served in India for a brief period at the end of the war. After the war he returned to work at Kingston. Between 1947 and 1950 his work was exhibited in Australia, New Zealand and Fiji. In 1961 he secured a grant from the Leverhulme Foundation and undertook a study tour in Italy, returning to Venice for three weeks and producing numerous sketches that formed the basis for much of his later work. Back at Kingston, he became Principal of the College of Art in 1962, progressing to Assistant Director of the Kingston Polytechnic and was Head of the Division of Design from 1970 until retirement in 1972. Although teaching and administration took much of his time, he continued to etch throughout his career, producing on average one plate per year. He also painted watercolours, self-taught and inspired by J. M. W. Turner. After retiring from Kingston he produced about four plates per year, producing sixty nine etchings between 1972 and 1994, almost doubling his pre-retirement output. In 1990 he released a book of his etchings, The Etchings of Wilfred Fairclough, in conjunction with Ian Lowe. Wilfred Fairclough died at Kingston upon Thames on 8 January 1996.

Bitumba were created in Zaire and Angola during the nineteenth century and the first part of the twentieth. The term tumba comes from the old Portuguese word for ‚Äútomb‚Äù‚Äî this genre may have been inspired by grave monuments for European merchants and missionaries in Kongo cemeteries. Materials and Dimensions Bituma were executed in soft stone. Their average height it close to 50 centimeters; the smallest bituma measure between 15 and 20 centimeters and the largest are approximately a meter in height. Historiography Artist Robert Verly gathered a large number of statues in the north of Angola near the Zaire border and, in the May 1955 issue of Zaire, he classified the objects by type and proposed an explanation for their use. In July 1978, the Institut des Musees Nationaux du Zaire at the Center for International Commerce of Zaire in Kinshasa mounted an exhibition of 72 bitumba called \\"Sculptures Stones from Lower Zaire.\\" Styles and Themes Bitumba sculptures are unique in their variety of styles. Robert Farris Thompson has identified about twenty workshops that explain stylistic individuality. The wide dispersal of the works, however, has made it impossible to localize their centers of production. Bitumba are express a variety of themes. The most widely found - about twenty percent of statues belong to this type - is a figure who raises his hands in front of his face in a gesture often interpreted as praying. The second most prevalent theme is that of mother and child. The art of Lower Zaire, and especially the art of Mayombe, is known for privileging maternity subjects. The third theme is that of the \\"thinker,\\" who holds on hand on the hip and the other pressed to check in an attitude of meditation.

In the first round Tyson had trouble connecting with his punches and Botha was able to dodge most of Tyson's attempts. With 10 seconds left in the round, Tyson was able to get a hold of Botha's left arm. Tyson refused to let go as the round came to an end causing Botha to try to punch his way free from Tyson's grip by using his free right hand. Referee Richard Steele tried in vain to separate the two fighters who were now throwing punches at each other after the bell. Both Tyson and Botha's corners, along with MGM Grand security rushed into the ring and were finally able to separate the two men.

Career Born in Xtiam, Nigeria, Okafor made his first and only Football League appearance at the end of the first-year of his three-year scholarship at Colchester United. His only game came against Blackpool on 8 May 1999, a 2‚Äì1 defeat at Bloomfield Road. He came on as a half-time substitute for David Gregory. Although he made no further appearances for the club, Okafor remained with the U's for the duration of his three-year scholarship.

At the end of the 2000‚Äì01 season however, he was released by Colchester after the club's management decided he did not possess enough quality for Division Two football at the time. After leaving Colchester, Okafor went on to play for non-league teams including Sittingbourne, Enfield, Hampton & Richmond Borough and Bromley while gaining a career in the City of London. Personal life Following his short football career Okafor became involved in the banking industry. Okafor married in 2003 but divorced in 2017 before re-marrying in 2017.

His father was the 1795 Derby-winning jockey, Anthony Wheatley. He was, according to the Sporting Magazine of 1831, \\"one of the best jockeys in England.\\" He was particularly known for creeping up slowly during a race to win unexpectedly. This was shown to memorable effect in the 1831 Derby. Wheatley was booked to ride 50/1 outsider, Spaniel, a horse known for only possessing one steady pace. The race principals ran together in a tactical battle and appeared to have forgotten about Wheatley on the unfancied Spaniel, who racing at his customary pace, \\"came up with perfect ease... [and] won in a most triumphant style\\". Wheatley's ride was deemed \\"a splendid performance.\\" Despite this, Spaniel has gone down in history as possibly the worst ever Derby winner. He was also known for having an untainted character, and in Spaniel's Derby he had had a ¬£25 bet at odds of 40/1 on his mount winning, only to cancel it at the last minute, thereby missing out on ¬£1000. Wheatley rode the Derby winner Mameluke in some of his best races (although not the Derby itself). One of his most noted rides was in the \\"ever-memorable\\" Ascot Gold Cup when he rode Mameluke against Zinganee, ridden by Sam Chifney, Jr. His principal patron was Lord Lowther. William Wheatley lived up to the 1840s at Newmarket where his father and family had settled but died at Kingsland, then a small settlement in Middlesex but now part of Hackney, in February 1848 aged about 62.

Cuatro novelas venezolanas inolvidables and produced by Venevisi√≥n in 1980. Flor N√∫√±ez and Jos√© Bardina as the main protagonists. Plot Isabel is the kind of secretary every executive dreams of: she is efficient, intelligent, hard working and reliable. But as a woman, she leaves much to be desired, as she is drab and insignificant. She has developed a shyness that was formed due to the influence of Lucrecia, her dominant and overprotective mother. Lucrecia is a religious fanatic that has made her daughter grow up with low self-esteem and a lack of interest in making herself attractive to men. Jose Manuel, Isabel's boss, is a handsome businessman who sees Isabel merely as an employee. Jose Manuel is a widower who has raised his daughter Maria Jes√∫s with the help of his mother-in-law who is not impressed that he has already begun to forget her daughter's memory by seeking other women, and she is forced to endure the presence of Ligia, Jose Manuel's frivolous girlfriend. Isabel has feelings for Jose Manuel, but she cannot dare tell him about them. Jose Manuel seems to be happy with Ligia, but what he doesn't know is that Ligia is bored with their relationship, and she cheats on him with her best friend's boyfriend. Jose Manuel soon discovers this deception, and devastated, he falls into depression. Ligia and her lover flee the city for fear of Jose Manuel's retaliation over the betrayal. In his sadness, Isabel tries her best to comfort Jose Manuel, and it is then that he begins to see the goodness and sweet nature of Isabel's heart, the secretary that he merely greeted every day with \\"Good morning, Isabel\\". But Jose Manuel makes the wrong decision and proposes to Isabel, not because he loves her but out of desperation, in an attempt to forget Ligia. The two finally get married, but the next day, Jose Manuel regrets his decision. Heartbroken, Isabel flees his cruel treatment and goes in search of his mother. But the experience has turned Isabel into a strong young woman and not the shy, weak secretary. Seeing that she cannot be able to control Isabel any longer, Do√±a Lucrecia falls ill and dies. Through a friend's recommendation, Isabel travels out of the country. Meanwhile, Jose Manuel realizes that his secretary meant more to him than he wanted to admit, but seeing that Isabel isn't around, he decides to wait for his wife. Ligia comes back with an attempt to win Jose Manuel back, but she is only faced by rejection.

It is a style of Shaolin Boxing. Proponents claim that adopting the fluidity of snakes allows them to entwine with their opponents in defense and strike them from angles they would not expect in offense. Snake style is said to especially lend itself to applications with the Chinese straight sword. The snake is also one of the animals imitated in Yang family Taijiquan (T'ai chi ch'uan), Baguazhang and Xingyiquan. The sinuous, fluid motion of the snake lends itself to the practical theory that underlies the \\"soft\\" martial arts. Different snake styles imitate different movements of snakes. Some, for example, imitate the Cylindrophiidae, while others imitate the python, while some schools imitate other types of snakes, like the viper and the cobra. There are two unrelated, Northern and Southern snake styles. Northern Style Snake is one of the archetypal Five Animals of Chinese martial arts; the other four being Crane, Tiger, Leopard, and Dragon. Snake style is based on whipping or rattling power which travels up the spine to the fingers, or in the case of the rattler, the body shake which travels down the spine to the tip of the tailbone. The ability to sinuously move, essentially by compressing one's stomach/abdominal muscles, is very important. Footing is quite grounded. The stancework is fluid in order to maximize the whipping potential of any movement. This necessitates building a strong spine to contain the power and strong fingers to convey the strike. Since breath is important to any movement of the spine and ribs, snake style is considered one of the main styles which eventually led to internal training. Snake style is also known as an approach to weapons training, the Chinese straight sword and spear in particular. There are even specialty varieties of sword blades and spear points that curve back and forth down the length of the blade in imitation of the snake's body known as snake sword and snake spear. Snake style generally aims for weak points of the human body, such as the eyes, groin and joints. Southern Style The Southern Shaolin Temple in Fukien Province was sometimes known as \\"the snake temple.\\" Snake style kung fu was practiced at this temple as well as dragon kung fu and praying mantis kung fu. Fukien temple was a refuge for the Henan Temple monks when that temple was destroyed. With them, they brought all the martial arts knowledge they had. The snake style of green bamboo viper is one of the five subsets that was taught at the Southern Shaolin Temple. This particular form of snake fist originated in Cambodia and worked its way up to China. As it was integrated into Shaolin, it got more refined and sophisticated. The green bamboo viper is the snake style taught in the United States by Grandmaster Wing Loc Johnson Ng. Grandmaster Ng taught this particular snake style as well as water snake, shadow snake, king cobra, and Golden snake. These five type snakes make up the southern snake style system. Snake style kung fu is considered to be a highly advanced form of fighting due to the use of internal energy (chi) and the specialized breathing techniques. There is also an obscure Southern Snake Style () whose grand master was Leung Tin Chiu who was born in the late 19th century and became well known as he ranked 35th in one of Nanking's Martial Art examinations in late 1929. His style (She yin Diu Sau), inherited from Ancient Monk, was an amalgamation of Southern Shaolin style and Choy Gar style learned from a Choy grandmaster. He had severals disciples, the main who received the legacy his nephew Master Some K.F Leung of Hong Kong and the late Master C. M Fong at present day head-father Master of the system. The pugilistic style is best described as a mid-distance fighting style, using, by coincidence, some Wing Chun-like techniques in Hung Ga or Choy Gar-like forms. That attests to the Southern Shaolin origin of this style and its close relationship to other styles originating from Southern Shaolin. In fact Yau Lung Kong first learned from the Choy's family, but he did not have the privilege to all the secrets. Being less than satisfied he enrolled himself at the Southern Shaolin temple years and later combined all that he learned into this snake style (\\"She Ying Diu Sao\\"). It would best be described as a \\"Choy-Fut\\" style (\\"fut\\" means \\"buddha,\\" a respectful address for deceased monks). Of course different \\"fut's\\" from the Southern Shaolin temple would pass on similar but different techniques or idiosyncratic execution of the same basic techniques. In this style of snake kung fu the force and techniques are softer than traditional southern styles. Besides straight punches and the flaming eye gouge as widely used in Wing Chun, this style also employs strikes fit¬¥s mill butterfly-buddha palms, the hook, upper cut, and gui quen (back fist) as central techniques. Biu tze (thrusting fingers) techniques resembling snake attacks are the secrets, and hence, the name of this style. There are multiple kicking techniques, as varied as typical northern styles with high kicks, but also typical are below-the-groin kicks seen in southern styles. There are six fist sets(like siu lam won, man fu ha san, she yin quan), two stick sets, single sword, short double swords, and other traditional weapons.

Alternative name: A Greater Promise  Plot  The film tells the story of a Jewish family relocating to the JAO (a.k.a. Birobid≈æan). \\"The plot lays out a successful solution to the \\"Jewish Question\\" through two love stories and a crime\\" in the JAO. The love stories and crime provide a narrative basis to demonstrate how several obstacles are overcome: # The end to impoverishment of the Jewish population; # The transformation of Jews into farmers; # Shifting the social structure of the Jews by integrating them into a ‚Äúproductive work‚Äù environment; # Replacing formerly religious social with secular socialist institutions; and # The sublimation of religiously and culturally based contradictions between different nationalities by virtue of a secular socialist Russian and Jewish culture Dvoira is the matriarch of a family that travels to Birobid≈æan in order to find a happy, economically and politically untroubled life. In the first sequence of the film we see the migrant family, consisting of Dvoira, her two daughters, Rosa and Basya, her son Lyova, and Basya's husband Pinya travelling to Birobid≈æan, first by ship and then by train. The point of origin is unclear, but the ship indicates that the family is coming from abroad. While some identify the United States as the family's origin, Alexander Senderovich in his Dissertation states that the family were ‚Äúrepatriates to Soviet Union from Palestine.‚ÄùSenderovich p296 Arriving in the JAO, despite difficulties in the beginning, the whole family quickly adjusts to the new way of living at the collective farm ‚ÄúRed fields‚Äù ‚Äì except for Pinya. While everyone else is excited to start working in the collective, Pinya only agreed to accompany the family after he read in a newspaper article that someone had found gold near the farm. Refusing to do hard physical work, he manages to be assigned to garden work, which gives him the opportunity to sneak away to a small river bank, where he searches for gold. Caught doing so by Lyovka, Pinya offers him half of the gold he found. But when Lyovka threatens to hand over the gold to the collective, Pinya hits Lyovka on the head with a shovel. Believing Lyovka to be dead, Pinya attempts to flee over the border to China, but gets caught and arrested. After arriving at the collective, Rosa, the daughter, meets Korney a young fisherman's son, and they fall in love with each other. Dvoira is worried about their relationship, because Korney is ‚Äúa Russian‚Äù and not a Jew. In a short conversation between mother and daughter, Rosa asks rhetorically: ‚ÄúI don't know who's better ‚Ä¶ The Russian Korney or the Jew Pinya?‚Äù Because Korney is found with Lyovka's body, the collective suspects him to be the murderer, and arrests him. Only when Lyovka somewhat miraculously awakes, and points to Pinya as the guilty, is Korney's name is cleared. The movie ends with the marriage celebration of Rosa and Korney and the last still showing Dvoira praising their bond and the government for providing Jews with a home country of their own: ‚ÄúPour some wine and we'll drink to our motherland and to those who gave us such a good life!‚Äù Basya, the second daughter has fallen in love with Natan, the chairman of the ‚ÄúRed Field‚Äù collective. But becoming a couple is not possible as Basya is married to Pinya. She is very unhappy in her marriage because Pinya has refused to assimilate. However, Pinya's arrest clears the path for the two, and, after Dvoira's blessing, they are shown dancing happily at Rosa's wedding celebration.  Background  The JAO experiment arose from different tendencies and conflicts in the broader discourse on the so-called ‚ÄúJewish question‚Äù in Russia of the early 20th century and shifts in the national policies of the post-revolutionary society. The puzzling question is why the Bolshevik soviet government that was originally committed to internationalism, at some point, agreed and actually pushed forward the establishment of a Jewish national project on the territory of the USSR. The phenomena of the JAO stands both in the context of the Zionist idea of Jewish Statehood and the history of the Jews in the Soviet Union, hence under consideration of the changing governmental policies on the matter and on the question of national policies in general. Before the October Revolution there were three main positions on the Jewish side on the matter of the ‚ÄúJewish question‚Äù. Two within Zionism, and one outside of it. The Zionist movement was split into those who aimed to establish a Jewish State on the territory of Palestine, and the territorialists for whom Palestine was only one of several options. A third position was held by the Bund (General Jewish Labor Bund of Lithuania, Poland and Russia) who promoted the idea of a national cultural autonomy in a multi-ethnic State. This notion of nationality was not bound to the existence of a national territory, but imagined an administrative unit for cultural issues independently from the place where someone lived. The Bund, in the pre- revolutionary time, pictured the future State as a federative System of culturally independent units without territorial binding.Kuchenbecker 2000 p43 In the beginning of the 20th century, before the October Revolution, a tense conflict between the Bund and the Iskra-group around Lenin broke out. The Bund called for the federal restructuring of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDRP), and the recognition of Jews as a nation. Both claims where heavily rejected by the Iskra-group as being separatist and backward. For the Bolsheviks the Jewish people couldn't be a nation, because they lacked one fundamental component: an own territory. In 1913 Stalin, who later between 1917 and 1923 held the position of the Commissariat for Nationalities Affairs, published an article on the point of view on nationhood by the social democratic party, where he defined nationhood by virtue of a common language and territory. In fact, in the context of Lenin's two phase model with the goal of merging all nations into one socialist world society, the Jews already held an advanced position.Kuchenbecker 2000 p43 The general answer to the ‚ÄúJewish question‚Äù by Marxists, including the Menshiviks, was assimilation. However, the post-revolutionary situation required a conceptual shift. At the end of the 19th century 74%Kuchenbecker 2000 p59 of the Jewish population, due to restrictions in the tsarist times, ‚Äúmade livings from petty commerce, retail sales, small-scale handicraft production, and unskilled labor‚Äù,Kuchenbecker 2000 p59 while only 3.5% worked in agriculture.Kuchenbecker p.59 The social structure of the Jewish population basically reversed the overall proportions of the agricultural society they were living in. Already the slowly starting industrialization had caused much unemployment among Jewish merchants and crafts. After the Bolsheviks took power in October 1917 their original belief in a self-completing assimilation process, was confronted with the actual mass poverty of the Russian Jews. World War I caused pogroms during the Civil War (1918-1920), and finally the Soviet centralization of production of even small industrial businesses and the prohibition of private propertyKuchenbecker p57 had catastrophic consequences for the Jews, due to their particular social structure, and most lived in despair.Kuchenbecker 2000 p57 The implementation of the NEP (New Economic Policy) in 1921, which brought back a low form of capitalist production, mitigated the situation partly. But many Jews fell under the category of li≈°ency. Li≈°ency means: ‚Äúthose who are deprived of rights‚Äù and was used as a political instrument to fight bourgeois elements. It was generally applied to all who were considered to have worked in sections that fell under the category of ‚Äúunproductive labor‚Äù. Hence, while the Bolshevik policy granted equal rights for Jews as Jews, their particular social structure effectively deprived about one third of them of these rights all over again.Kuchenbecker 2000 p60-62 The Soviet government was conscious of this dilemma. In order to solve this problem two institutions were founded, KOMZET and OZET, and provided with the task of a ‚Äúproductivation‚Äù of the Jewish population, by finding a territory were Jews could be relocated and transformed into farmers, as agriculture was considered ‚Äúproductive work‚Äù. In contrast to the pre-revolutionary position Russian Jews were now handled in the same way as the multiple other nations living on the former tsarist territory. ‚ÄúNational in form and socialist in content‚Äù,Weinberg 1998 p15 was Stalin's well known formula. The goal now was to establish a secular Yiddish counter-culture against a religiously or Zionist self-understanding. Most other nations, though, had their territory within or outside the USSR. In contrast to, e.g., Germans or Polish living on Russian soil, Jews were exceptional in the sense that they were an extra-territory nation without even a territory elsewhere. After a first attempt to relocate the Jewish population in the Crimea had failed due to the resistance of the local authorities and antisemitic biases and even attacks by the peasantry, the decision fell on a region in the far east with a border to China ‚Äì Birobid≈æan. In 1928, the Soviets designated the regional around the rivers Bira and Bid≈æan for the Jewish Autonomous Oblast (JAO). Weinberg p21 In 1934 the area was officially declared to be the JAO. Weinberg p24 The relocation project, however, already began in 1928.Kuchenbecker 2000 p62 For this, propaganda was produced on a large scale. From literature to radio broadcasts over poems, songs and a stage play, even an airplane was named ‚ÄúBirobidzhanets‚Äù. Weinberg p39 Also, the free train ride, and a welcome payment were extra motivations.Kuchenbecker 2000 p128 However, the organization was disastrous. The provided shelters were quickly overcrowded, and in combination with the rough climate, heavy rainfalls in spring, hot and humid summers, and very cold winters, hunger and disease were the result. Many arrivals who could afford it, left after a very short time, leaving only the poorest behind.Kuchenbecker 2000 p128 Between 1936 and 1938, beginning in the same year in which ‚ÄúSeekers of Happiness‚Äù was released, purges in all national republics and provinces took place, wiping out the local party leaderships and administrative elites. With them the national policy shifted from a cultural integrative federal system to Russification and centralism.Kuchenbecker p183 The murder of the JAO elites was being justified by reproaching them of secret Zionist and Trotskyst ideology and espionage. 1938 even KOMZET and OZET fell prey to the Great Purge. In effect the purge led to the destruction of the soviet Yiddish culture that had slowly developed in the short time the JAO had already existed. Only after World War II and under the impression of the shoa, a Yiddish culture on Soviet soil was shortly in bloom again. This time, however, not initiated by the government, but solely due to higher migration.  Motifs: Dreams, work, and happiness  Pinya with his bottle of gold dust In the scene where Lyovka catches Pinya searching for gold, the latter envisions himself as the owner of a suspender factory. This vision is ironically contrasted by the fact that Pinya constantly has to pull up his falling pants throughout the movie. Pinya's dream is individualist and based on the idea of private property. This becomes clear both in his dream to become a factory owner and in his defense later that the gold belongs to him, because he has extracted it himself. But the latter also contradicts Pinya's general characterization as lazy. It is clearly Pinya's future vision of himself that activates his willingness of physical work. But the seed capital that the gold is supposed to become, is neither the product of exploitation nor of any kind of violent dispossession as described in Marx' chapter on the ‚Äúso called primitive accumulation‚Äù. Accordingly, Pinya is not persecuted for the possession of gold, but for attempted murder. Pinya's gold obsession is rather condemned morally, as it is causing Pinya's disposition to commit a murder. The notion of work that produces private property is delegitimized by presenting it as morally corruptible. Although, after he is captured, Pinya receives many deprecating stares, the gold functions solely as the motif in the criminal case. But his capitalist dream not only activates his willingness to do physical work, it also provides him with a brief moment of happiness, namely when he first believes to have found gold. The suggestively appealing contrast between the movie's title on the one and Pinya's role on the other side ‚Äì the first called ‚ÄúSeekers of Happiness‚Äù and the latter ‚Äúseeking for gold‚Äù - proves to be reductive. The movie rather depicts happiness as the successful actualization of a dream by means of work. This becomes very clear, when one looks at the representation of happiness in the rest of the movie. Almost all of the scenes, apart from those who show people at work, are such, in which a problem is addressed, while every time the movie shows people going to, coming from, or being at work, they are depicted as happy ‚Äì smiling, laughing, whistling. The only exceptions to this are love scenes between Rosa and Korney and their marriage at the very end of the movie. In a suggestive montage Pinya's gold-seeking is juxtaposed with the harvest of the collective, which is depicted as productive by the shear mass of ‚Äúgolden wheat‚Äù, as the first line of the Russian extra-diegetic song that underlies the pictures comments. When, earlier in the movie, Pinya asks a worker, what one needs in order to find gold, he answers: ‚ÄúLuck.‚Äù Hence the montage contrasts two notions or modes of work in their relation to happiness. While Pinya's brief experience of happiness is shown to be dependent on luck and holds only for the moment in which he finds what he's looking for, the work of the collective is shown to be substantially correlated with happiness, as the collectively organized process is in its productivity identical with the actualization of the socialist dream. The relation of the two modes of production and their relation to happiness are put in contrast as individual vs collective, based on luck vs self-sustainable, and unproductive vs productive.  Jewish Elements in the Movie   The wandering Jew and Luftmensch  The topos of the wandering Jew is used several times throughout the movie. In the opening scene of the film a non-diegetic Yiddish song about the ‚Äúinterminable Jewish wanderings‚Äù is heard and complemented by Pinya's muttering: ‚ÄúHere we are traveling, and traveling / Maybe we'll never get there....‚Äù Senderovich concludes: ‚ÄúThe family's journey is supposedly intended to put an end both to the eternal Jewish displacement and to unproductive Jewish existence represented by Pinya.‚ÄùSenderovich p281 The motif of the wandering Jew and his characterization as a lutftmensch (‚Äúman of air‚Äù) who works with his head instead of his hands are merged in Pinya's figure. But both are not represented as natural features, but as a particular habitus based on the socio-economical living conditions of Jews before the revolution. As Pinya says at the end of the movie: ‚ÄúWe never had enough bread. Gold is money, and money is everything. I don't understand anything.‚Äù Pinya's whole character, from his optical appearance, as a capitalist with bowler hat and pocket watch, over his gestures that always signify weighing up different options, to his greedy and restless character, he is featured with Semitic stereotypes. Hence the movie doesn't falsify these stereotypes, but contextualizes their allegedly actual existence through their relation to social conditions. This makes Pinya rather into a tragic than into a malicious figure.  Language  All the characters in the film speak Russian. Several songs, however, are sung in Yiddish. At the train station, where the family arrives, a Hebrew lettering on the wall reads in Yiddish: ‚ÄúSoll leben die Lenin-Stalin'sche Nation‚Äù (‚ÄúViva The Leninist-Stalinist nation!‚Äù). In addition several people are shown reading a Yiddish newspaper (probably the ‚ÄúShtern‚Äù), and at an information booth Yiddish brochures are lying out, being titled e.g. ‚ÄúLenin‚Äù. Jewish nationality is Yiddish language with soviet content.  Religious institutions  Dvoira, the mother, represents the character that holds on to religious institutions. When she worries about Rosa's involvement with Korney and is in need of advice, she doesn't know to whom she should turn. ‚ÄúIn the shtel‚Äù she ‚Äúsought advice from the Rabbi‚Äù, as she mentions towards Natan, the chairman of the collective, who then offers his advice. The social function of the Rabbi is substituted by a representative of the party, who, as Dvoira concludes, is ‚Äúeven better‚Äù. Nonetheless, Dvoira remains skeptical towards the inter-religious or inter-ethnic relationship. Her turning point cannot be marked decisively, but might be triggered by the fact, that ‚Äúthe Jew Pinya‚Äù attempted to murder her son. Like the original suspicion against Korney in the murder case proves to be unfounded, so does Dvoiras reluctance in the love case, resulting in the secular marriage at the end of the film. Jewish mourning traditionally involves sitting next to the corpse for several days, while friends and family come by to offer support to the mourning ‚Äì this institution is called Shiva. Although Lyovka turns out not to be dead at the end, the viewers are made believe that he is, and are shown a mourning scene in which Dvoira kneels next to Lyovka's bed crying. Surprisingly the film offers no substitute for the collective Jewish mourning institution. Rosa who tries to support the desperate mother is even called away to work, leaving her mother alone with her grief. In addition, over the bed in which Loyvka lays, hangs the picture of a Rabbi. But in the following scene in Natan's bureau this picture is replaced by one of Stalin. The conversation between Rosa and Natan already suggests that Natan believes Korney to be innocent and suspects Pinya of the crime. The replacement of the picture is paralleled with the replacement of the murder suspects, and as Natan has already occupied the advisory function of the shtetl Rabbi, Korney's acquittal also places him symbolically at the position of an acceptable husband for Rosa, despite his non-Jewish heritage. In particular, because the rhetorical question posed by Rosa: ‚ÄúI don't know who's better ‚Ä¶ The Russian Korney or the Jew Pinya?‚Äù, finds a definite answer here. The wedding at the end of the movie is accordingly a secular wedding. However both Yiddish and Russian music is sung and played.  Between the Stills  Despite the relatively straightforward propagandistic message the film might also contain elements of counter- narratives. Senderovich suggests such a reading in the train sequence at the beginning of the film: ‚Äúa peculiar figure appears: a man playing a mournful tune on his clarinet. He identifies the tune as 'Israel's Lament on the banks of the Amur River' ‚Ä¶ The title of the tune calls to mind the words of Psalm 137, about the exile of the people of Israel in 587 BCE to ancient Babylon: 'By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Zion.' By transposing the toponym of ' the rivers of Babylon' onto the 'banks of the Amur River', the river that forms the border between the Jewish Autonomous Region and China, the song turns Birobidzhan not into a Soviet Zion but into Babylon.‚Äù Senderovich pp 281‚Äì282 A second possible inscribed double coding can be found at the train station after the family arrives in Birobid≈æan. The Yiddish phrase in Hebrew lettering placed dominantly on the arch of the room refers to the discourse on Jewish nationhood: ‚ÄúSoll leben die die Lenin-Stalin'sche Nation‚Äù (‚ÄúShall live the Lenin-Stalinist nation‚Äù). Shortly after this shot we are shown a conversation between Pinya and Basya discussing the ‚ÄúRed Field‚Äù collective as a possible destination of their journey. Behind the two a poster is hanging with a Yiddish text whose entire content cannot be reconstructed. However, one word can be read clearly in several stills depicting Basya: ‚ÄúBund‚Äù (‚Äú◊ë◊ï◊†◊ì\\") The word calls to mind an alternative solution to the ‚ÄúJewish problem‚Äù by referring to the Bund (General Jewish Labor Bund of Lithuania, Poland and Russia) and its idea of a non- territorial cultural Jewish autonomy in a federally structured Soviet State. A third counter-narrative might be seen in the above-mentioned replacement of the Rabbi's picture with one of Stalin. Seekers of happiness was released in 1936 shortly before the beginning of the Great Purge in which the entire political elite of the JAO was decimated. However, purges where already happening in the beginning of 1936 on a smaller scale. The Rabbi in the frame hanging over the bed is presumably Rabbi Israel Meir HaCohen Kagan a.k.a. the ‚ÄúChofetz Chaim‚Äù, a famous Polish Rabbi of the 19th century. ‚ÄúChofetz Chaim‚Äù translates ‚ÄúSeeker of live‚Äù. In his main work ‚ÄúSefer Chofetz Chaim‚Äù he deals with the problem of ‚ÄúLashon Hara‚Äù, the term for derogatory speech about another person which is severely forbidden in Jewish law, even then when what is said is true. The subject matter of Lashon Hara has several reference points in the plot of the film. Firstly, of course, the constant complains about Pinya's attitude. Secondly, the mourning scene stands in the context of the falsely accused Korney. The fact that the Rabbi's picture is hanging over the bed is confusing in as much as Dvoira had already accepted Natan as an advisor substituting for the advisory function of the Rabbi in the shtetl earlier in the movie. The persistence of the Rabbi's presence might signify Dvoira's not yet completely overcome religious belief. But it might as well, for those educated in Jewish tradition, comment on the atmosphere of denunciation in the Stalinist era. The replacement of the Rabbi's picture by one of Stalin might then not signify solely a process of secularization based on functional substitution, but puts Natan as the one structurally holding the Rabbi's place in contrast to Stalin. The film can then be read as aesthetically foreshadowing the purge of the Jewish elite which Natan stands for. In all three examples the understanding of the suggested counter- narratives is based on the condition that the viewer is educated in Jewish religion or culture: biblical knowledge in the first, Hebrew reading literacy in the second, and knowledge of Jewish law in the third. The film undermines censorship by unfolding the critical message by means of esoteric signs only readable for the Jewish audience.

(A Live Set) is a live acoustic album by Steve Harley, released under the name The Steve Harley Band and featuring members of the Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel line-up of the time. It was released in 2004. Background Following the early 2003 release of the live album Acoustic and Pure: Live, Harley soon organised a new UK and Irish acoustic tour for May‚ÄìJune 2003, which would feature four members of Cockney Rebel - Barry Wickens, Robbie Gladwell, James Lascelles and Lincoln Anderson. In a June online diary entry, Harley revealed that several shows on the tour had been recorded for a future live CD. He commented: Later in October, he announced the idea of using tracks from both the Huntingdon Hall and the Jazz Caf√© concerts for the album. He also spoke of the possibility of including one or two newly-recorded studio tracks, as well as an unreleased studio track from Harley's sessions with Mickie Most in the mid-1980s. By November, Harley announced that he was considering mixing the live tracks and getting the album ready for a release in March 2004, to coincide with an upcoming UK tour. During November, work commenced on the live recordings, with Harley working with engineer Matt Butler. Harley revealed in a diary entry that month: In January 2004, Harley announced the new album was on schedule for being released at the beginning of the upcoming tour. By the end of that month, the album's title had been decided upon, while the artwork had also been completed. Harley commented: \\"I like it a lot. Matt Butler has done a fine job of re-mixing the sound and the Worcester and Jazz Caf√© audiences do more than their bit. There is some really brilliant playing from the band. It will be on sale from the first night of the tour, in lobbies around Britain, from Southampton to, well, Glasgow, eh!\\" Anytime! (A Live Set) was released in 2004. It features eleven live tracks and a bonus track; \\"Sophistication\\", which was a previously unreleased studio recording from 1986. To date, it remains exclusive to the album. In June 2005 interview with Record Collector magazine's Nick Dalton, Harley spoke of his current musical style: \\"Anytime! is seriously unplugged electro-acoustic. It's similar to original Cockney Rebel ‚Äì violin, no electric guitar. But I still like playing with my electric band. I'm doing Glastonbury again, headlining the acoustic stage for the first time.\\" Sophistication The previously unreleased track \\"Sophistication\\", from 1986, was produced by Harley and Mickie Most. Like much of Harley's output from the same period, the song was due to be released on Harley's solo album El Gran Senor. However, the album was shelved and left unreleased after RAK Records went bankrupt later in the year. Although many of the songs would later be re-recorded for Harley's 1992 album Yes You Can, \\"Sophistication\\" remained unreleased. Despite this, Harley frequently performed the song live during 1989, after Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel made a return to touring with the \\"Come Back, All is Forgiven\\" tour. The song features Andrew Gold on keyboards. Harley later recalled in 2015: While Harley was considering the release of a new live album, he had first mentioned the possibility of releasing \\"Sophistication\\" in an October 2003 diary entry. Speaking of an \\"old recording\\", he said: \\"Don't imagine even the most fervent and enterprising among you has the track I'm thinking of on bootleg! Only Mickie Most and I ever took copies and the master tapes are here in this house. Gotcha!\\" Later in November, Harley sent the song's quarter-inch tape to engineer Matt Butler. In a diary entry at that time, Harley revealed: \\"Waiting to hear from Matt regarding the state of the quarter-inch tape he's been sent. It's 17 years old and will need treating with kid gloves.\\" Release The album was released by Gott Discs on CD in the UK only. Pinnacle Records handled the album's distribution. The album had been licensed to Gott by Harley's own Comeuppance Ltd. The album's photographs of Harley, including the front cover shot, had been taken by Manfred Esser during October 2003 in Germany. Today, the album is out of print. Track listing Critical reception In 2005, Peter Makowski of Classic Rock reviewed Anytime! (A Live Set) and commented: \\"Mr Soft gets unplugged. A few months ago I saw Pete Doherty play a solo acoustic show at my local. Never a big fan of The Libertines, I must admit that he was spectacular. Solo and hype-free, you could see that he was actually a gifted songwriter. The same goes for Steve Harley who is a craftsman with a canny ear for a hook and catchy chorus. Both artistes have attitude and conviction; both are former buskers. Here 'live and unplugged' the former Cockney Rebel takes us through a tour of all the hits and more. But it's the lesser-known material like the emotive \\"A Friend for Life\\" that makes Harley sound fresh and edgy, like a latter day Libertine.\\" Joe Geesin of the webzine Get Ready to Rock! said: \\"Opener \\"Mr Soft\\" has an uptempo quirky offbeat, while the violin on \\"Mirror Freak\\" adds an interesting if moody touch. Ballads, rockers and acoustic strumming, all the styles explored do nod back to the pub rock roots, and many emphasise Harley's songwriting. Of course there's the obligatory \\"Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)\\" which does work rather well. Thoroughly enjoyable, but probably more for the fans.\\" In the 2007 Italian book 24.000 Dischi (24,000 discs), Riccardo Bertoncelli and Cris Thellung stated: \\"An acoustic concert, new songs and interpretations of old classics, which are still beautiful and mostly performed by Harley with a passion and feeling really touching.\\" Personnel ;Band * Steve Harley ‚Äì vocals, acoustic guitar * Robbie Gladwell - guitar, backing vocals * Barry Wickens ‚Äì violin, guitar, backing vocals * James Lascelles ‚Äì percussion (all tracks), hammered dulcimer (track 11), melodica (track 8) * Lincoln Anderson ‚Äì double bass ;Recording and production * Steve Harley ‚Äì producer * Matt Butler ‚Äì producer, mixer * Matt Davis, Mike Hood, Nick Smith, Chris Wemyss, Gary Low, Dave Boothroyd - recording team at Huntingdon Hall, Worcester * Eliot James from FX Rentals - recording team at Jazz Caf√©, London * Rob Andrews - recording team at Chapel Lane Studios * Jake Jackson - recording team at AIR Studios References Category:2004 live albums Category:Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel albums ","title":"Anytime!

After showing little promise in his early career he ran well in several important handicap races in 1973 before stepping up in class to record a 28/1 upset victory in the St Leger on 15 September. He was later sold and exported to stand as a breeding stallion in Hungary. Background Peleid was a bay horse bred by his owner Colonel William E. Behrens. He was from the fourth crop of foals sired by Derring-Do, a horse whose wins included the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 1965 and whose other offspring included the 2000 Guineas winners High Top and Roland Gardens. Peleid's dam, Winning Bid, was a successful broodmare who also produced the Eclipse Stakes winner Coup de Feu. The colt was trained by Bill Elsey at his Highfield stables in Malton, North Yorkshire. Racing career 1972: two- year-old season Peleid was not campaigned in the highest class, and won only once, when taking a maiden race at York Racecourse in July. 1973: three-year-old season As a three-year-old Peleid was mainly campaigned in handicap races and made steady progress. After winning over one mile at Liverpool on Grand National day in March he won the valuable Zetland Gold Cup over ten furlongs at Redcar Racecourse in May. In June he was sent to Royal Ascot where he finished second to Zab in the King George V Stakes. In July he won the John Smith's Magnet Cup at York and was then sent to France where he finished second in the Prix de la Ville de Trouville. In August he returned to York for the Ebor Handicap over one and three quarter miles. Carrying a weight of 114 pounds he finished fourth to Bonne Noel. In September Peleid was one of thirteen three-year-olds to contest the St Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse. Ridden by the 47-year-old veteran Frankie Durr, he was not regarded as a serious contender, and started at odds of 28/1. It was believed that Peleid had raced too prominently in the early stages of the Ebor, and on this occasion Durr restrained the colt in the early stages before making his challenge in the straight. He took the lead inside the last quarter mile and accelerated clear of the field to win by two and a half lengths and a neck from Buoy and Duke of Ragusa. He was the first winner of the race trained in the North of England since the filly Cantelo, trained by Elsey's father Charles Elsey won in 1959. 1974: four-year-old season Peleid remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to win a race in Britain: he did finish second in the John Porter Stakes and third in the Jockey Club Stakes. In the autumn he was sold and exported to Hungary. He won the Great Breeders' Prize in his new country before being retired to stud. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Peleid a \\"poor\\" St Leger winner.

It was first published by in hardcover by DAW Books in 1996.http://www.mzbworks.com/works.htm Marion Zimmer Bradley Literary Trust Since the book involves time travel, it falls in both the Darkover time periods that the author called \\"Against the Terrans: The Second Age (after the Comyn)\\" and in the Ages of Chaos. In terms of Darkover's timeline, the book starts place about a year after Exile's Song, and is a continuation of that story. Plot summary Part One Mikhail Lanart- Hastur is sent to the isolated Elhalyn estate to check on Priscilla Elhayln and her children. He discovers that Priscilla is deranged, under the influence of a ‚Äúhedge-witch,‚Äù Emelda, and finds that the children are severely neglected. With the assistance of his tower-trained sister, Liriel, he is able to free the children from Emelda, though Priscilla dies in the process. Throughout his journey, he is accompanied by a crow.In City of Sorcery, crows are avatars for the Dark Sisterhood and are associated with the goddess, Avarra. Marguerida Alton undertakes the study of matrix science at Arilinn Tower, though she does not get along well with the keeper or her fellow students. They are uneasy about her ‚Äúshadow matrix,‚Äù the outlines of a matrix that glow in her right hand (see Exile's Song for a more complete explanation). Part Two Mikhail and his sister, Liriel, arrive at Comyn Castle with the five Elhalyn children. He describes to his uncle, Regis, his experiences at Elhalyn, explaining that none of the three boys are suitable to serve in the traditional role of Elhalyn king. At the annual Midwinter Ball, a thunderous voice cries, ‚ÄúTo Hali, now!‚Äù which Mikhail and Marguerida understand is a command for them. They ride to the ruins of Hali Tower, and upon entering, find themselves in the distant past. Part Three The only resident of Hali Tower is its keeper, Amalie El Haliene, who tells them that the legendary laranzu, Varzil the Good, is living, but in hiding. Mikhail and Marguerida realize that he has sent for them, and determine to find him, despite the dangers. At small lake cottage, they encounter the elderly Varzil the Good. Varzil says that he must pass his matrix ring to Mikhail, which requires the couple be united in marriage, so they can join their powers together. It becomes clear that Varzil intends to send the ring back to their present time, to protect it from capture by the powerful leronis, Ashara Alton (see Exile's Song for a more complete explanation). Having managed the ring- swap, Varzil vanishes, stranding Mikhail and Marguerida in the Ages of Chaos. After a month or more, they return to Hali Tower, and traverse time into their own present. They are rescued by Lew Alton, and returned to Thendara. While no one is happy about the marriage, because it concentrates too much power in a single couple, they eventually accept it as fa√Æt accompli. Regis Hastur‚Äôs son, Dani, resolves this problem by saying that he will serve as the traditional Elhalyn King by marrying Miralys Elhalyn, while suggesting that Mikhail serve as the power behind the throne, just as Hasturs have done for generations. His unexpected solution is accepted.

The name of their land, Blokumannaland, has also been preserved. Victor Spinei, Florin Curta, Florin Pintescu and other historians identify them as Romanians (variation of the exonym Vlach), while Omeljan Pritsak argues that they were Cumans. Judith Jesch adds the possibility that the terms meant \\"black men\\", the meaning of which is unclear. Historians identify Blokumannaland as the lands south of the Lower Danube which were inhabited by Vlachs in the Middle Ages, adding that the term may refer to either Wallachia (to the north of the Danube) or Africa in the modern Icelandic language. Blakumen on runestone G134 Varangian trading posts at the Black Sea (the map depicts the lands now forming Romania as being inhabited by Romanians, but their presence in period is not universally accepted) The only preserved example of the variant Blakumen of the ethnonym was an inscription on a runestone in the Sjonhem cemetery in Gotland in Sweden. The forms of the runes on the memorial stone suggest that it was raised in approximately 1050 AD. According to its inscription, a Varangian couple named Hr√≥√∞v√≠sl and Hr√≥√∞elfr set up the stone in memory of one of their sons, Hr√≥√∞f√∫ss, who had been treacherously killed by Blakumen while traveling abroad. Although the inscription does not contain more information about the crime, Spinei expands on the inscription, arguing that Hr√≥√∞f√∫ss was murdered by Vlachs in the regions east of the Carpathian Mountains. Curta proposes that Hr√≥√∞f√∫ss was a merchant traveling towards Constantinople, who was attacked and killed by Vlachs north of the Lower Danube. Jesch likewise suggests that Hr√≥√∞f√∫ss was a merchant \\"on a voyage abroad\\", and assumes that he was murdered by local merchants who betrayed his trust. Jesch translates Blakumen as Vlachs, confronting their treachery with their untrustworthiness as claimed by Kekaumenos. Jesch also allows for the possibility that the term may have meant \\"black men\\", in which case the meaning is unclear. Pritsak refuses to identify the Blakumen in the inscription with Vlachs, instead stating that they were Cumans, whose migration towards the westernmost regions of the Pontic steppes began around the time when the memorial stone was erected. Spinei counters this view on account of the fact that several mentions of the Blakumen or Bl√∂kumen (for instance in the Eymund's Saga) occur in contexts taking place decades before the earliest appearance of the Cumans in the Pontic steppe. Spinei also says that if understood as meaning \\"Black Cumans\\", then the term is not concordant with the Varangian ethnic terminology (derived from either Germanic or East-Slavic naming traditions), that it is not attested in mirror forms in other languages (such as *cumani nigri in Latin or *mauro Koumanoi in Greek), and that the juxtaposition of a Scandinavian adjective and a proper name of Greek or Latin origin (at the expense of the German Walven designating Cumans) to produce Blakumen (\\"black Cumans\\") and Blokumannaland (\\"the land of the black Cumans\\") is highly improbable. Bl√∂kumenn in the Flatey Book Bl√∂kumen are mentioned in the Flateyjarb√≥k, an Icelandic manuscript from the late 14th century, which preserved a 13th-century biography of King Olaf of Norway. This work contains a separate chapter on the adventures of a Norwegian prince, Eymund, at the court of Prince Jarizleifr in Novgorod. The chapter narrates that Eymund informed Jarizleifr of the departure of Jarizleifr's brother, Burizlaf, to Tyrkland, and added that Burizlaf was preparing to attack Jarizleifr with a huge army formed by Tyrkir, Bl√∂kumen and other peoples. Curta, Spinei and other scholars identify Jarizleifr with Yaroslav the Wise, and Burizlaf with Sviatopolk I of Kiev. They argue that the reference to the Tyrkir and Bl√∂kumen proves that Sviatopolk I hired Pechenegs and Vlachs when he decided to go to war with Yaroslav. Furthermore, they propose that the Bl√∂kumenn of the Flatey Book, like the Blakumen of the runic inscription from Gottland, were Vlachs from Moldavia or Wallachia. Blokumannaland Blokumannaland is a territory mentioned in Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla (\\"The Circle of the World\\") from the 13th century. The book narrates how the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, referred to by the name Kirjalax, invaded Blokumannaland where he fought against pagan tribes. Since these pagans have not been identified, there is disagreement as to the actual date of the Byzantine invasion. For instance, Spinei identifies the events prescribed in the Heimskringla with the Battle of Levounion of 1091 AD, which ended with the catastrophic defeat of the Pechenegs by the Byzantines. He argues that Blokumannaland refers to a territory inhabited by Vlachs south of the Lower Danube. On the other hand, Sandaaker proposes that the battle took place in 1040 AD, while the latest date of 1122 AD was proposed by Ellis Davidson and Bl√∂ndal. Alexandru Madgearu says that Sturluson anachronistically mentioned the lands south of the Danube as Blokummanaland, because the latter term referred to the Second Bulgarian Empire in Sturluson's time. In the modern Icelandic language, the term Blokumannaland may refer to either Wallachia or Africa.

He was the father of the lawyer and politician Sir Thomas Crooke, 1st Baronet, founder of the town of Baltimore, County Cork, and of Helkiah Crooke, Court physician to King James I. Life He was born at Cransley in Northamptonshire. From his will we know that he had several siblings and that his father after his mother's death remarried a Mrs. Joyner, who was still alive in 1595. His son Thomas in his will of 1629 left a legacy to \\"my good old Aunt Hudson\\", who was probably the elder Thomas's sister; she was still alive in 1635. Sir George Croke, one of the High Court judges who heard the Case of Ship Money, is sometimes referred to as his cousin, but the exact connection between them is unclear. He went to school in Stamford and matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1560, becoming scholar in 1562, Bachelor of Arts 1563 and Master of Arts 1566. He was ordained in 1568 in Norwich and presented to the living of Great Waldingfield, Suffolk in 1571. He graduated Doctor of Theology from Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1578. Great Waldingfield Great Waldingfield- Thomas was vicar here from 1571 From the beginning of his career he belonged to the \\"godly elite\\", the circle of Calvinist clerics who included John Foxe, Thomas Cartwright, John Field and Thomas Wilcox, all of whom were friends of his. He was a member of the conference which first met in 1570 to press its program of ecclesiastical reform on Parliament. Unlike some of his colleagues he left no published works behind him, and does not seem to have played a leading part in the religious debates of the time. However his strong Calvinist views were well known to the Church authorities; possibly ss s precaution, he obtained the position of preacher to Gray's Inn, being \\"specially appointed\\" to it in 1582. He combined this with the living of St. Mary Woolchurch. This apparently saved him from a serious clash with either John Aylmer, Bishop of London or John Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury; the authorities even enlisted him from time to time to engage in controversy with the Jesuits. He became reader at St Peter, Westcheap in 1597. He died in 1598 and as requested in his will (an unusually long and detailed one) was buried in St. Mary Woolchurch \\"without superstition or vanity... since it is there that a great part of my poor labours have been bestowed for many years\\". Family His wife was a Miss Samuel. In addition to Sir Thomas Crooke, they had four sons: Samuel, a preacher of some note, Helkiah Crooke, Court physician to King James I, John, and Richard. They had four daughters: Sarah, who married Stephen Egerton, another of the godly elite, Rachel, who married Henry Rosse, a London goldsmith, Anne and Elizabeth. John may have died before 1630 since Thomas' eldest son, Sir Thomas Crooke, does not mention him (unlike his three brothers) in his will; from this will we also know that Rachel (by then \\"much impoverished\\") was still alive in 1630. Sarah had died in 1624; in her will she left to her brother Thomas her husband's ring \\"with a death's head\\", to Samuel her wedding ring, and small sums of money to her other siblings. Through Sarah's husband Stephen Egerton the Crookes had a family connection with John Winthrop, the celebrated Governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony, who married Stephen's niece Margaret Tyndal Winthrop.

Only one was built. Design and development The H.26 before covering at the Paris Aero Show December 1922, with early wings The H.26 (the first Hanriot fighter that did not use the HD nomenclature, where the D was for their long-standing designer Emile Dupont) was intended for the 1921 C1 (single seat Chasseur or fighter) programme competition. Most participants used the V-8 Hispano-Suiza 8F engine, with its low frontal area. Instead, the H.26 used a lower power, water cooled Salmson 9Z 9-cylinder radial engine. The H.26 aimed to redress the balance by aerodynamic cleanliness, with few interplane struts, flying wires or exposed cabane struts. It was an all-metal single bay sesquiplane, fabric covered except for the fuselage ahead of the cockpit. The gap between the wings was small and the stagger marked. The lower wing was conventionally mounted at the bottom of the fuselage and the upper planes, built in separate pieces, braced close to the upper fuselage on short, faired extensions. In section the wings were aerodynamically thick and strongly cambered. There were ailerons only on the upper plane, the plan, structure and bracing of which was greatly altered during 1923. When the H.26 made its first public appearance, at the Paris Aero Show in December 1922, the still uncovered upper wing of the unflown fighter had long, gently curved tips outboard of a straight edged, constant chord central section and had a single main spar. Sixteen months later, after the aircraft had flown, the wings had become rectangular and were built around two spars. The short span lower wing retained its single spar structure throughout but it, too, had curved tips replaced with square. The wing bracing had also changed: originally a bracing wire ran from the rear undercarriage structure upwards and outwards, via the lower to the upper wing. This was replaced by a single, wide chord rigid strut with an aerofoil section and widened at its roots. The closely cowled radial engine set the diameter of the H.26's short nose and drove a two blade propeller behind a very large diameter domed spinner. The Salmson was initially cooled with a semi-circular Botali radiator to the rear of the engine but this proved ineffective and was replaced with a pair of Chaussons, one on each forward undercarriage leg. The H.26 had a fixed conventional undercarriage with mainwheels on a centrally hinged split axle, enclosed within a lift-contributing wing-like fairing and supported by N-form struts attached to the lower fuselage longerons on each side. Originally, these were reinforced by long vertical struts from the shock absorber attachments to the upper wing central section. These were discarded when the interplane wires were replaced by the faired interplane struts, which extended downwards to the rear undercarriage structure; the tops of the shock absorber struts were relocated to mid-fuselage on the engine mounting. The pilot's cockpit, with a faired headrest behind it, was at the trailing edge of the upper wing, placed within a small cut-out to improve his limited view. The H.26 had a fuselage built around four metal tube, cross-braced longerons, enclosed within metal formers and stringers to shape it into an oval cross- section. Behind him the fuselage tapered to the broad chord fixed tail surfaces. The mid-fuselage tailplane, which had a strongly swept leading edge, carried round tipped elevators that narrowed inboard. The vertical tail was oval shaped, with a broad chord rudder that ended at the top of the fuselage. The H.26 was first flown from Orly in 1923. Initially troubled by engine overheating, it proved to have handling problems and a poor view for the pilot; despite the modifications, its test programme was soon abandoned. Specifications 3-view of the H.26 published early 1923, showing early wing plan, wire bracing and a different vertical tail to those of 1924.

Career According to Trita Parsi's Treacherous Alliance, in early 1980 Kashani visited Israel to discuss arms sales and military cooperation regarding Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor. This resulted in an arms deal (a shipment of F4 Phantom tyres and other weapons, the beginning of Operation Seashell) and the Ayatollah Khomeini's permission for large numbers of Iranian Jews to leave Iran, including thousands who left via bus to Pakistan and then via air to Austria, before heading to the US or Israel.Trita Parsi (2007), Treacherous Alliance: The Secret Dealings of Israel, Iran, and the United States, Yale University Press, p95 Kashani was a deputy for Natanz when he was one of several arrested in 1986 on charges of conspiring with Mehdi Hashemi. Details of the alleged links with Hashemi were not provided.Bahman Baktiari (1996), Parliamentary Politics in Revolutionary Iran: The Institutionalization of Factional Politics, University Press of Florida, p137 Hashemi and one other were executed, while the rest, including Kashani, were pardoned or received sentences.

Donated by then Archbishop of Armagh, Lord John Beresford it was designed by Sir Charles Lanyon, sculpted by Thomas Kirk and finished in 1853. Location It is located in what is considered the middle of Trinity College, however its actual location is in the northwest of college (the actual middle being the Museum Building). At the central axis of the college's Library Square, to the north is the Graduates Memorial Building, south the college's Old Library, east The Rubrics, to the west Trinity College's Front Gate and Regent House. It is the most recent bell tower in a long line dating back to the original tower of the monastery of All Hallows. Design The entire structure stands at tall and is mainly granite in composition with its carvings being of portland stone. Lanyon had originally intended the campanile to be linked to the buildings on either side (Old Library and Graduates Memorial Building) by an ‚Äúarcaded screen‚Äù, however this was never realised. Base The base has paired rusticated Doric pilasters with portland entablature blocks. Between each pillar of the base are four round-headed arches, and each archway has a keystone. These keystones each have detailed carved heads, which depict Homer, Socrates, Plato and Demosthenes - representing the liberal arts. Before the belfry, is a stepped circular base made of granite. At the corners of the campanile, seated and supported by this circular base are the Higher Faculties represented in four deceptive figures of Divinity, Science, Medicine and Law sculpted from portland stone by Irish sculptor Thomas Kirk. Belfry The belfry is a cylindrical chamber encircled by Corinthian columns, between which are tall, round-head traceried windows with cast iron grills. The base of the belfry also has four carved coats of arms at each side, almost directly above the carved keystone faces below. Each coat of arms faces out onto a prominent location in the college, and symbolize strong connections it had with external forces. These four coats of arms are those of: *Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, from 1837. It faces onto Parliament Square. *Trinity College Dublin, though a 19th-century variant, with the Lion Passant Guardian rather than simply Passant and the Castle towers are Flamant rather than domed. This is slightly different from the original of the college, and can also be seen on the Museum Building. It faces onto Library Square. *Arms of Lord John Beresford, the second son of the first Marquess of Waterford, who was the Chancellor of the University. It faces onto Botany Bay. *Archbishopric of Armagh, and impaled with those of Lord John Beresford. It faces onto Fellows‚Äô Square. Dome and lantern Over the belfry are two domes which are covered in decorative scale-patterns. The first is the larger of the two and has carved scrollwork ribs that continue vertically from the columns of the belfry. The smaller dome sits directly above the larger, commonly referred to as a lantern rather than a dome. The entire campanile is then topped by a gilded cross. Superstition The college tradition and superstition holds that any student who passes beneath the campanile will fail their exams, causing some to never pass under it until they finish their time at Trinity College.. There is another student legend that the bell will ring automatically when a virgin stands underneath it. This was the subject of a cartoon in Trinity News c. 1966, by Nick Robinson, which showed a forlorn student couple standing under the Campanile while the bell remained silent. The boy says to the girl \\"Maybe if you jump up and down a little\\".

He was best known for his many duo recordings with Henry Burr, and as a member of the Peerless Quartet and other vocal groups, but also recorded successfully as a solo singer both under his own name and under various pseudonyms including Frank Howard. Biography He was born in Brooklyn, New York, and while in his teens worked for the music publishers Edward B. Marks and Jos. W. Stern.Gage Averill, Four Parts, No Waiting : A Social History of American Barbershop Quartet, Oxford University Press, 2003, p.64 When Marks and Stern organized the Universal Phonograph Company in early 1897, Campbell began recording for them as part of the Diamond Quartette (aka Diamond Four) and Diamond Comedy Four (with Steve Porter, Jim Reynard and Billy Jones). These groups soon began recording discs for the Berliner Gramophone Co., and Campbell began recording solo vocal records for Reed, Dawson & Co., the Norcross Phonograph Co., Berliner Gramophone, Columbia Phonograph Co. and Edison's National Phonograph Co. Among his early solo successes were \\"My Wild Irish Rose\\" (recorded for both Berliner and Edison, 1899); \\"Ma Blushin' Rosie\\" (recorded for Gram-o-Phone Records, 1900); and \\"Love Me and the World Is Mine\\" (for Victor, 1906). Campbell also recorded, after the late 1890s, as part of the Columbia Male Quartet, which after 1907 became more generally known as the Peerless Quartet. The group was the most commercially successful of the acoustic era, and at the peak of their popularity, between about 1911 and 1917, also featured tenor Henry Burr, baritone Arthur Collins, and bass John Meyer. Their most successful recordings over the period included \\"I Want A Girl (Just Like The Girl That Married Dear Old Dad)\\" (1911); \\"I Didn't Raise My Boy To Be A Soldier\\" (1915); and \\"Over There\\" (1917). Campbell made few solo recordings after 1907, but formed a highly successful recording partnership with Henry Burr. The pair had a succession of major commercial hits between 1911 and 1925. These included \\"When I was Twenty-One and You Were Sweet Sixteen\\" (recorded for Columbia, 1912); \\"The Trail of the Lonesome Pine\\" (Columbia, 1913); \\"I'm On My Way To Mandalay\\" (Columbia, Edison, Indestructible, and Victor, 1914); \\"Close to My Heart\\" (Columbia, 1915); \\"There's a Quaker Down In Quaker Town\\" (Victor, 1916); \\"Lookout Mountain\\" (Columbia and Victor, 1917); \\"Till We Meet Again\\" (Columbia, Emerson, and Paramount, 1919); and \\"I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles\\" (Columbia and OKeh, 1919).Whitburn, Pop Memories 1890-1954, pp.69-70 Campbell and Burr, together with John Meyer and Frank Croxton, continued to perform and record as the Peerless Quartet with some success until 1925, when the group disbanded.

He wrote it in Vienna in 1768 at age 12. He scored the work in C major for mixed choir SATB with a few solo lines, orchestra and organ. The text is a Pentecostal antiphon, ' (For invoking the Holy Spirit), which begins with the same words as the sequence ', but continues differently. Mozart added the subtitle Offertorium, mentioning the intended use during the offertory of a church service. The beginning of the words suggests Pentecost, but the general call for the Holy Spirit seems more likely to have been composed in the fall. The work is structured in two parts, the text of the antiphon and an extended Alleluia. The first part is in 3/4-time and marked Allegro, the second in 2/4-time and marked Presto. The choir sings for most of the time, only occasionally interspersed by solo lines which are always set for two voices. The orchestral parts are for two oboes, two horns, two trumpets, timpani, strings and organ. The music is influenced by his teachers Leopold Mozart, Michael Haydn and Johann Ernst Eberlin. The Alleluia is sometimes performed independently.

The skull roof is strongly reminiscent of those of coccosteids, but also has anatomical features otherwise diagnostic of buchanosteids. This mix of anatomy lead its describer, Wang Junqing, to suggest that X. wui is the sister taxon of Coccosteidae, and represents a transitional form between Coccosteidae and Buchanosteidae.

History George was born in Adelaide to Thomas Napier Sprod (4 February 1884 ‚Äì 9 August 1942) and his wife Isabelle Kathleen (n√©e Knight) (7 April 1888 ‚Äì 10 April 1991), members of the Cudmore family, prominent in Adelaide society. As a youth he and his sister Kathleen were frequent and respected contributors of poems and drawings to the Register News-Pictorial's \\"Sunbeams\\" pages and its successor, the Sunday Mail's \\"Sunshine Club\\". He attended Norwood High School then Urrbrae Agricultural High School, as his parents had expected him to embark on a life of agriculture, but he showed little aptitude for the profession. He attended Art School but may not have completed a year, as by 1939 he was in Sydney, having left home on a bicycle, which he abandoned at Hay to complete the journey by rail. Apart from sales of a few cartoons to Smith's Weekly, he did not achieve his artistic ambitions, failed as a photographer and was sacked after a week's work at the De La Salle Brothers school (perhaps De La Salle College Ashfield), so he enlisted in the AIF as a gunner (giving his year of birth as 1918) with 2/15 Field Regiment, and sent overseas. He was one of the many captured by the Japanese in the fall of Malaya and spent the years 1942 to 1945 as a POW, conscripted to work on the Thai-Burma Railway and in Changi Prison, where he developed his artistic talents. A fellow prisoner was the great British cartoonist Ronald Searle; they, and others, contributed to a fortnightly camp magazine The Exile. After the war he returned to Sydney, where he sold illustrated articles on his experiences to the Australian press, first to the Fairfax Sydney Morning Herald, then to Frank Packer's Australian Women's Weekly. where he secured a position, contributing occasionally to its companion The Daily Telegraph. In 1949 he left for London, where he had work published by various magazines including the News Chronicle, but most importantly for PunchLindesay, Vane The inked-in Image, Hutchinson of Australia 1979 and was praised by Malcolm Muggeridge For twenty years he was one of that magazine's most published artists. He left London around 1969 and returned to Sydney, settling in Sydney's Kings Cross, which at the time had a thriving community of artists. Family While in London he married Francine Humphries (n√©e Dessant) on 22 July 1961. A son, Douglas Peter Sprod was born in 1962 (and lives in England); the couple separated sometime before 1968; she died in March 1982. George was survived by his sister Kathleen Carter and brothers John and Dan.

The tornado touched down just northwest of Newcastle at 2:56 p.m. CDT (19:46 UTC), and stayed on the ground for 37 minutes over a path, crossing through a heavily populated section of Moore. The tornado was wide at its peak.https://www.weather.gov/oun/events-20130520-tornadotable It followed a roughly similar track to the deadlier 1999 Bridge Creek‚ÄìMoore tornado, which was smaller in size but just as severe; however, very few homes and neither of the stricken schools in the area had purpose-built storm shelters in the intervening years since the earlier tornado struck Moore. Meteorological synopsis Comparison between the preliminary tornado track (red), the 1999 Bridge Creek‚ÄìMoore tornado (green), and the 2003 Moore‚ÄìChoctaw tornado (blue); graphic produced by the National Weather Service Norman, Oklahoma. On May 20, 2013, a prominent central upper trough moved eastward toward the Central United States, with a lead upper low pivoting over the Dakotas and Upper Midwest region. A Southern stream shortwave trough and a moderately strong polar jet moved east-northeastward over the southern Rockies to the southern Great Plains and Ozarks area, with severe thunderstorms forming during the peak hours of heating. With the influence of moderately strong cyclonic flow aloft, the air mass was expected to become unstable across much of the southern Great Plains, Ozarks, and middle Mississippi Valley by the afternoon hours. Evidence of an unstable air mass included temperatures in the low to mid 80s ¬∞F (27‚Äì30 ¬∞C), dewpoints that ranged in the upper 60s ¬∞F (20 ¬∞C) to the lower 70s ¬∞F (20‚Äì22 ¬∞C), and CAPE values ranging from 3500‚Äì5000 J/kg. Deep-layer wind shear speeds of enhanced storm structure and intensity. These were present ahead of a cold front extending from a surface low in the eastern Dakotas, southwestward to near the Kansas City area and western Oklahoma, and ahead of a dry line extending from southwest Oklahoma southward into northwestern and west-central Texas. Outflow remnants from the previous night and the early day convection across the Ozarks and the middle Mississippi Valley were a factor in severe weather development with the most aggressive heating and destabilization on the western edge of this activity across the southern Great Plains and just ahead of a cold front. The National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma had warned as early as May 15 that there would be a possibility of severe weather on May 20. The most intense severe weather activity was expected to come across the southern Great Plains, specifically Central Oklahoma, during the afternoon hours on that Monday. As such, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk of severe thunderstorms during the early morning hours of May 20 from southeastern Missouri to north-central Texas. The degree of wind shear, moisture, and instability within the warm sector favored the development of supercells. Very large hail and tornadoes were both expected with these supercells, with the possibility of a few strong tornadoes. The Storm Prediction Center issued a tornado watch at 1:10 p.m. Central Daylight Time (CDT) early that afternoon for the eastern two-thirds of Oklahoma, northwestern Arkansas, and portions of north-central Texas. Given the atmospheric parameters thought to be in place at the time, the Storm Prediction Center inadvertently underestimated the threat of tornadic activity that afternoon; the probability table for the tornado watch ‚Äì the 191st severe weather watch issued by the guidance center in 2013 ‚Äì indicated a 40% (or \\"moderate\\") probability of two or more tornadoes and a 20% (or \\"low\\") probability of one or more tornadoes reaching between EF2 and EF5 intensity within the watch area. Storm development and track Radar images of the Moore tornado with a debris ball and signature hook echo. The thunderstorm that eventually produced the tornado developed less than one hour after the tornado watch was issued, around 2:00 p.m. CDT, across northern Grady County. Its rapid intensification resulted in the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Norman issuing a severe thunderstorm warning for northern Grady, northwestern Cleveland, northern McClain, and southwestern Oklahoma Counties (including southwestern portions of the immediate Oklahoma City area) at 2:12 p.m. CDT. The thunderstorm quickly attained supercell characteristics, with rotation at the mid-levels of the storm's cloud structure becoming apparent even before it was officially classified as severe, due to the sufficient amounts of wind shear present over central Oklahoma. Due to the expected intensity of the storms, which were expected to be equal ‚Äì if not, stronger ‚Äì in severity to the supercells that produced the five tornadoes in the expected area of greatest tornadic threat the day prior, three of the Oklahoma City market's five television news outlets ‚àí NBC affiliate KFOR-TV (channel 4), ABC affiliate KOCO-TV (channel 5) and CBS affiliate KWTV (channel 9) ‚àí suspended normal programming and went into wall-to-wall weather coverage immediately after the tornado watch went into effect (Fox affiliate KOKH-TV (channel 25) and Telemundo affiliate KTUZ- TV (channel 30) began their coverage as the first severe thunderstorms erupted southwest of the state capital), and subsequently began relaying their audio feeds to radio stations throughout central Oklahoma. As the forecast suggested that the most significant severe weather would occur in the mid-afternoon, around the time classes concluded for the day, many worried parents began arriving at schools throughout Moore and south Oklahoma City to pick up their children in advance of the storm. At 2:40 p.m. CDT, as rotation in the supercell was increasing at the cloud base, a tornado warning was issued for far northeastern Grady, western Cleveland, northern McClain, and southern Oklahoma Counties, as the storm approached the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. The tornado touched down at 2:56 p.m. CDT in northeastern Grady County, near Long Drive and the southwest corner of the North Country Club Road and Northwest 32nd Street intersection, roughly northwest of downtown Newcastle. Initially a narrow cone-shaped tornado, it first caused EF1 damage to a home and some trees before rapidly intensifying and striking a semi-rural subdivision on the north side of Northwest 32nd, where several homes were destroyed, two of which were leveled at EF4 intensity. At this point, the tornado began to grow rapidly in size, evolving into a large, wedge-shaped structure; slight ground scouring began in this area. Several homes in a subdivision further to the northeast sustained EF3 damage. By 3:01 p.m. CDT, the National Weather Service issued a second, more strongly worded warning for the area: in a special weather statement that updated the existing tornado warning, the Norman forecast office declared a tornado emergency for southern Oklahoma City and Moore as various storm spotters confirmed that the large, violent tornado was approaching the area. The Twin Lakes dual-polarization NEXRAD radar (near Lake Stanley Draper) detected a tornado debris signature one mile in diameter within the accompanying hook echo, as the tornado crossed into portions of south Oklahoma City in northern Cleveland County. The supercell also produced straight-line winds of for at least one mile surrounding the tornadic circulation. Extreme vehicle damage and ground scouring at the Celestial Acres horse training area. The tornado maintained EF3 intensity as it crossed the Canadian River into Cleveland County, and a decommissioned U.S. 62/U.S. 277 bridge was severely damaged; this bridge had to be demolished after the tornado ripped part of it from its mount and tossed it across Interstate 44. The tornado then continued directly toward south Oklahoma City and Moore, roughly following Southwest 149th Street. At that point, it began to grow rapidly in width, and a second brief area of EF4 damage was noted near South May Avenue, where several homes were leveled, and one was swept clean from its foundation (this home was determined to have been nailed, rather than bolted to its foundation). A vehicle frame, engine block, and various other vehicle parts were found tangled within a grove of completely debarked trees in this area. As the tornado began to cross into south Oklahoma City, a traffic jam had occurred for a stretch of several miles along Santa Fe Avenue, as residents attempted to either escape from or pick up their children at schools located near the tornado's path. As the station's news helicopter was capturing live video of the tornado, then-KWTV chief meteorologist Gary England ‚àí upon seeing footage of the backup that was being relayed by pilot Jim Gardner ‚àí urged drivers caught in the jam that may have been listening to the station's audio simulcast on area radio outlets to use nearby streets to detour out of the tornado's expected track. The tornado weakened briefly to an EF3 before re-intensifying to EF4 intensity near Forman Drive, flattening several homes as it moved through mostly rural areas south of Southwest 149th Street. As the tornado struck an oil production site, four oil tanks were blown away, one of which was never found. The others were thrown considerable distances, one of which was found a mile away. The tornado maintained its intensity as it struck the Orr Family Farm and the Celestial Acres horse training area, where up to 100 horses were reported killed, some being tossed into and tangled in downed power lines or thrown on top of nearby buildings; several horses that survived the tornado suffered severe injuries, with some being impaled by tree limbs or boards. Every building at Celestial Acres was either leveled or swept away at EF4 intensity, the ground on the property was scoured to bare soil, and vehicles were thrown and stripped down to their frames.The tornado was likely at EF5 intensity in this area though construction quality permitted an EF4 rating. A 10-ton propane tank on the Orr Farm property was picked up and thrown more than a half-mile through the air by the tornado, and a strip mall near the farm was completely leveled as well. The tornado continued east, heavily scouring an open grassy field before slamming into Briarwood Elementary School, which was completely destroyed. The NWS originally rated this damage EF5, but further evaluation and a 2014 study published by the American Meteorological Society revealed evidence of poor construction at the school, and the rating was downgraded to EF4. Remarkably, no fatalities occurred at the school.https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=451572 Two 12,000-gallon water tanks that were also swept off of the Orr Family Farm grounds were thrown into this area; the roof of Briarwood Elementary was struck by one of them ‚àí potentially aiding in compromising the building's structural integrity as it bent the steel girders that held up the roof ‚àí shortly before the main vortex struck the building, while the other fell onto and destroyed a home a few blocks east of the school. Past Briarwood Elementary, the tornado intensified even further and entered densely populated areas of western Moore, including the Westmoor subdivision where many well- built, anchor-bolted brick homes were flattened at EF4 intensity, and two were swept clean from their foundations, with damage at those two homes rated EF5. Tim Marshall surveys a neighborhood that was devastated. The tornado continued generally northeast at EF4 strength, completely debarking trees and leveling entire neighborhoods. Many homes were flattened in neighborhoods to the east of South Santa Fe Avenue. One anchor-bolted home that was reduced to a bare slab in this area was initially rated EF5, but was later downgraded to EF4 as closer inspection of the foundation revealed that the anchor bolts were missing their nuts and washers. The tornado then destroyed Plaza Towers Elementary School at EF4 intensity, where seven children were killed as a result of a collapsed cinder block wall. More than a dozen homes in a subdivision just to the south of Plaza Towers Elementary were swept cleanly away, though they were revealed to have been nailed rather than bolted to their foundations, and damage to this subdivision was subsequently rated EF4, though the tornado was likely extremely violent as grass scouring was very intense in this area. Entire blocks of homes were flattened, trees were completely debarked and denuded, vehicles were thrown and mangled, and the ground was severely scoured in other residential areas nearby, with the damage also rated EF4 in these areas. Most of the fatalities from the tornado occurred in the Plaza Towers neighborhood of Moore. In one of these houses (a block away from Plaza Towers Elementary), a woman was killed as she tried to seek shelter in a closet. The Moore Medical Center and many vehicles left in ruins after the tornado. Further to the northeast, at least a dozen cars were piled up against the front entrance of the Moore Medical Center, which sustained EF4 damage. One car was lofted and thrown onto the roof. Many homes in neighborhoods near the medical center were completely destroyed, including a row of four well-built brick homes with anchor bolts that were swept away, with damage to those four homes rated EF5. An open field directly behind this row of homes was deeply scoured, with only bare soil and clumps of dirt remaining. A nearby manhole cover was removed, and multiple vehicles were mangled beyond recognition and caked in mud in this area as well. The nearby Warren Theater was spared a direct hit, but still sustained considerable damage to its exterior. A bowling alley in the area was leveled, and a 7-Eleven which was on the northern part of the damage path, was completely flattened with four people killed inside (including a three-month-old infant). The nearby Moore Cemetery was heavily damaged as well. The tornado briefly weakened and caused EF3 damage to some other businesses near Interstate 35, before crossing and mangling several vehicles in the process. The tornado regained EF4 intensity on the other side of the Interstate as it tore through several neighborhoods and destroyed numerous additional homes (though the EF4 damage swath was narrower at this point). A large grassy field between two subdivisions in this area was scoured to bare soil, with wind-rowed structural debris and several mangled vehicles strewn to the east. One brick home on Hunters Glen Court sustained EF5 damage, with only the slab foundation and anchor bolts remaining. Very little structural debris or house contents was recovered from that residence, and the small amount of debris that remained was wind-rowed well away from the site. Two vehicles were also lofted from the residence, one of which was thrown over . A large, well-built home that sustained EF5 damage in eastern Moore. The tornado continued through Moore's eastern neighborhoods. Highland East Jr. High's main building was spared, but the separate gymnasium building was completely destroyed, and a set of lockers from the structure was lofted and thrown a considerable distance into a nearby neighborhood. The Moore Public Schools administration building, a converted former hospital located a few blocks to the east, was also struck and destroyed. The tornado was noticeably narrower at this point, but was still causing a continuous swath of EF4 damage to numerous homes as it moved through multiple subdivisions. A well-built, anchor-bolted home at the corner of Heatherwood Drive and Southeast 5th Street was reduced to a bare slab, sustaining EF5 damage. A large, well-bolted-down home at the end of a private drive near South Olde Bridge Road was also swept cleanly away at EF5 intensity. Debris was scattered well away from the site, a vehicle was thrown over 100 yards, and wind-rowing was again noted at that location. Further east, the tornado weakened to EF3 strength and exited the most populated parts of Moore, destroying six industrial buildings and damaging two others. A final small area of EF4 damage was noted nearby as two homes and a concrete building were leveled. The tornado then began to rapidly narrow and weaken, snapping and uprooting several trees and causing EF2 damage to a farm just east of Moore, where the house lost its roof and an outbuilding was destroyed. A pickup truck slid away from the farm into a field while remaining upright. The violent updrafts in the supercell that produced the tornado lofted debris from homes and other buildings in Moore at least outside of the tornado's outer circulation, with reports of various objects and personal possessions being found as far away as Midwest City. At 3:33 p.m. CDT, the tornado dissipated at a nearby treeline about one-third of a mile east of Air Depot Boulevard. Impact Aerial view of a destroyed neighborhood to east of Interstate 35, taken by the Oklahoma National Guard. The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management reported that 25 people were killed (with another death indirectly attributed to the tornado). An estimated 1,150 homes were destroyed, resulting in an estimated $2 billion in damages. The number of injured was 377. Entire subdivisions were obliterated, and houses were flattened in a large swath of the city. The majority of a neighborhood just west of the Moore Medical Center was destroyed. Witnesses said the tornado more closely resembled \\"a giant black wall of destruction\\" than a typical twister. Among the hardest hit areas were two public schools: Briarwood Elementary School and Plaza Towers Elementary School. A preliminary study of Briarwood Elementary School conducted in September 2013 by a group of structural engineers found some structural deficiencies that led to its collapse during the tornado. Chris Ramseyer, a structural engineer and an associate professor at the University of Oklahoma determined that the building's walls that were not reinforced with concrete, there had been a lack of connection between the masonry walls and support beams in several portions of the building, and anchor bolts were pulled from the ground by the tornado. Another engineer that was involved in the study stated that the deficiencies that Ramseyer pointed out were not uncommon building practices at the time, and that current building code standards would not ensure that Briarwood would have withstood winds in excess of 200 mph. At Plaza Towers, the second school to be hit, parents had been allowed to collect their children early in preparation for the oncoming storm, as by the time the tornado struck only about 75 students and teachers were in the building. Many students and teachers took shelter in bathrooms and closets, but in a newer addition to the building which housed the school's second and third grade classrooms, seven fatalities occurred. Third grade teacher Jennifer Doan was taking shelter with eleven of her students in a hallway when the tornado struck. Doan and her students were trapped when the walls of the corridor collapsed on top of them. Doan, who was two months pregnant with her third child at the time, suffered severe injuries to her back, but did not lose the baby. She and five of her students were pulled out, with the children suffering only minor to moderate injuries. Tragically, six of her students along with a student from another third grade class died. The Moore Medical Center was heavily damaged, but no one present in the building was injured by the tornado. The center's staff had to relocate 30 patients to a hospital in Norman and another hospital. Part of Interstate 35 was shut down due to debris that had been thrown onto the freeway. On May 21, Moore still did not have running water. There were more than 61,500 power outages related to the tornado. More than 100 people were rescued from areas that sustained significant damage from the tornado. Over a dozen emergency workers comb through the rubble of Plaza Towers Elementary School. The Oklahoma Department of Insurance estimated that insurance claims for damage would likely be more than $1 billion. Some meteorologists estimated that the energy released by the storm could have been eight to more than 600 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Casualties Governor Mary Fallin stands with a family that survived the devastating Moore tornado. In addition to erroneous reports concerning the status of Briarwood and Plaza Towers students, various reports regarding fatality and injury counts as well as persons unaccounted for were circulated by traditional and social media outlets in the immediate hours after the tornado struck, which could not immediately be confirmed or refuted due to communications disruptions in the affected areas or were the result of incorrect counting due to miscommunication of estimates. Within the first two days, it was reported that between 237 and 240 people had been injured, with the tally later increasing to over 350. The final count of injuries was later adjusted downward to 212. On the morning of May 21, the medical examiner's office incorrectly stated that 91 bodies of tornado victims had been received. This number was up from the earlier report of 51 bodies that were incorrectly stated as having been received. Upon the office's discovery that some victims were mistakenly counted twice due to communication errors made by Moore rescue response units that the bodies were admitted to area funeral homes (nearly all of the deceased were actually transported to the examiner's office in Oklahoma City), the actual number was revised downward and later confirmed at 24 tornado victims and two indirect victims. The first two deaths occurred in a house east of Briarwood Elementary School; one occurred near Santa Fe Avenue; seven occurred following a wall collapse at Plaza Towers Elementary; nine occurred within the neighborhoods mainly south of Plaza Towers Elementary; one occurred just east of Interstate 35; and one occurred in a home between Eastern Avenue and Bryant Avenue. A 90-year-old woman who suffered a fractured skull during the tornado later suffered a pair of strokes and died on August 5. On May 6, 2018, nearly five years after the tornado, a 14-year-old survivor who suffered posttraumatic stress disorder after losing seven of his friends at Plaza Towers Elementary School committed suicide. The 2013 Moore tornado was the deadliest tornado recorded in the U.S. since the Joplin, Missouri tornado that killed 158 people in May 2011. Patients were taken to Integris Southwest Medical Center and The Children's Hospital at OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City. Over 140 patients, including at least 70 children, were treated at hospitals. Aftermath President Barack Obama talks on the phone to Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin in the Oval Office. Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin declared a state of emergency on May 20. She held her first post-tornado news conference at noon on May 21. The Federal Emergency Management Agency deployed urban search and rescue teams to the tornado-hit areas, and provided incident command personnel to organize and support rescue efforts. The Oklahoma National Guard was also deployed. Governor Mary Fallin requested assistance from then-President Barack Obama who declared a major disaster in the state and ordered federal aid to the affected areas. Governor Fallin quickly dismissed an idea to make a law that would require all schools in Oklahoma to have a shelter that would protect children during severe weather (prior to the tornado, only two of the twelve schools in the Moore Public Schools district had storm shelters, Kelley Elementary and Westmoore High School, which were rebuilt with concrete safe rooms after both were destroyed in the 1999 Bridge Creek‚ÄìMoore tornado). Cleveland, Lincoln, McClain, Oklahoma, and Pottawatomie Counties received federal funding for hazard mitigation measure statewide. Obama visited the disaster-stricken areas on May 26. Major structural damage at Briarwood Elementary School. The third season finale of the sitcom Mike & Molly, titled \\"Windy City\\", was pulled by CBS from its original May 20 airdate within hours of the event due to the episode featuring a plotline involving a tornado descending on Chicago; the network later rescheduled the episode to air ten days later on May 30, 2013. At noon on May 21, the U.S. Senate held a moment of silence for the victims. Delegates from several countries and Pope Francis offered condolences, and the United Nations offered assistance in the recovery efforts. The Canadian Red Cross began accepting donations of money and supplies for their American counterparts, to assist with disaster relief and recovery. The damage from the tornado was still evident one month later. The United Methodist Committee on Relief, Direct Relief, Matt Kemp of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder, Continental Resources, Devon Energy, ONEOK, Koch Industries, Hobby Lobby, and Carrie Underwood all pledged donations to the relief efforts. Moore Mayor Glenn Lewis stated that he would attempt to get an ordinance passed requiring storm shelters or safe rooms in new housing projects. On May 29, 2013, NBC aired Healing in the Heartland: Relief Benefit Concert, a fundraising concert that was held at Chesapeake Energy Arena in downtown Oklahoma City. The benefit was hosted by country singer and Oklahoma native Blake Shelton and featured performances from Miranda Lambert, Vince Gill, Reba McEntire, Rascal Flatts, Usher, Darius Rucker and Luke Bryan. The concert raised more than $6 million for the United Way of Central Oklahoma. On June 2, 2013, Discovery Channel aired an hour-long documentary about the storm titled Mile-Wide Tornado: Oklahoma Disaster. The documentary provides a comprehensive look at the tornado's impact and drew comparisons of the storm to the 1999 Bridge Creek-Moore tornado. The Moore City Council proposed a measure making twelve changes to its residential building codes, include requiring that new home construction in the city include hurricane clips or framing anchors, continuous plywood bracing and wind-resistant garage doors in order for homes to withstand winds up to 135 mph (equivalent to a high-end EF2 tornado). When the measure was passed in a unanimous vote held on March 17, 2014, Moore became the first city in the United States to adopt a building code addressing the effects of tornadoes on homes, which exceed the national standards set by the National Association of Home Builders.

The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Founding Monaghan Mill was founded by Lewis Wardlaw Parker (1865-1916) and his cousin, Thomas Fleming Parker (1860-1926). Lewis Parker was born in Abbeville, South Carolina, and graduated from the College of South Carolina in 1885, and from its law school two years later. After teaching in Columbia, he practiced law in Greenville and there became president of the Bank of Greer. Thomas Fleming Parker was born in Charleston and attended the College of Charleston before moving to Greenville, where his father held shares in a group of cotton mills.Mary G. Arial and Nancy J. Smith, Weaver of Dreams: A History of Parker District (Columbia, SC: R. L. Bryan Co., 1977), 23-30. Because the Bank of Greer was the receiver for the Victor Manufacturing Company, in 1897, Lewis Parker reorganized it as well as the Whaley Mills of Columbia. In February 1900, Parker and his cousin Thomas organized Monaghan Mill and named it for County Monaghan, the birthplace of their grandfather Thomas Fleming. The Rhode Island firm of Lockwood, Greene & Co. built the mill, which opened in 1902 on 325 acres on the west side of Greenville near the Reedy River. The mill was capitalized at $450,000 and had 35,000 spindles.Judith Bainbridge, \\"The Monaghan Community,\\" (September 1996), accessed March 27, 2013, Greenville County Redevelopment Authority. Monaghan was successful from the beginning, producing \\"print cloths, fancy dress goods and shirtings,\\" and \\"shade cloth.\\" By 1907, Monaghan had increased its spindles to 60,000 and the capital in stock alone had increased to $700,000. The surge in textile manufacturing drew workers from other states and Europe to Greenville. For instance, Monaghan employed fifty Belgian immigrants, who lived at one of the mill's boarding houses.Bainbridge. In 1911, the Parker cousins merged the Victor and Whaley Mills, which they already owned, with the Olympia, Richland, Granby, and Capital City Mills of Columbia, and the Appalache Mills of Greer, to form the Parker Cotton Mills Company, which was capitalized at $15 million and operated over a million spindles, more than any other contemporary U.S. textile firm. The company collapsed in 1914 because of a lack of capital during a cotton panic that occurred at the outbreak of World War I. Lewis resigned the presidency of the company and practiced law until his death from cancer in 1916. Thomas eventually retired. The first successful cotton mill merger did not occur for another twenty years. In 1917, the former Parker mills were reorganized into the Victor-Monaghan Group, and were sold in 1946 to J. P. Stevens and Company.James M. Richardson, History of Greenville County South Carolina (Spartanburg, S. C.: The Reprint Company, 1980), 99-101; Nancy Vance Ashmore Cooper, Greenville: Woven from the Past (Sun Valley, CA: American Historical Press, 2000), 129-131. Monaghan Mill's first president was M. C. Branch. He was succeeded three years later by W. E. Beattie, and in 1922 by Thomas Marchant. Marchant's brother-in-law, Arthur Cottingham, served until 1949 as general manager, when the company was purchased by J. P. Stevens and Co. Mill village As president of Monaghan, Thomas Parker strove to make the mill a model of paternalistic management. Parker provided a community medical clinic and hired one of the best doctors in the area, as well as a nurse, to staff it. Parker also provided an elementary school, a playground, and a YMCA. The YMCA building alone cost $18,000 (easily ten times that much a century later) and was the first located in a southern mill town. As a director of the YMCA, Parker hired an unusually gifted young man, Lawrence Peter \\"Pete\\" Hollis, who eventually became a nationally recognized educator.Bainbridge; August Kohn, The Cotton Mills of South Carolina (Spartanburg, S.C.: The Reprint Company, 1975), 32-36, 93, 195, 209. As early as 1904 Monaghan had its own baseball team; and in 1907, Monaghan joined the newly formed Greenville Cotton Mill Base Ball League. The Monaghan team provided both recreation and entertainment for workers, and the sense of pride that accompanied identification with a successful sports team increased worker loyalty.Thomas K. Perry, Textile League Baseball: South Carolina's Mill Teams, 1880-1955 (Jefferson, NC: Mcfarland and Co., 1993), 15, 17, 18, 119, 120. As was typical in the southern textile industry, the Monaghan Mill and its mill village were largely self-sufficient. The mill had its own well, generated its own electricity, and had its own waste disposal collection. The company store sold most goods workers required. There was even a mill church, shared by Baptists and Methodists until those denominations built their own buildings. During the 1920s and '30s, mill president Thomas Marchant continued the paternalistic management of his predecessors, loaning money to mill workers for causes he deemed worthy and sponsoring social activities such as picnics and festivities on holidays like the Fourth of July.Bainbridge. One worker recalled that \\"Monaghan people didn't lack for anything. My mother's house burned down; the company gave money to buy things and to rebuild and refurnish it. They would lend money for anything worthwhile. My boy went to Clemson; they lent the money.\\" Monaghan workers sang with apparent genuine enthusiasm, \\"I locked my heart and threw away the key: Monaghan! Monaghan! Monaghan! That's the place to be.\\" See PDF \\"Nomination Form\\" at National Register description. Monaghan built two kindergartens and an elementary school. Because Greenville High School was overcrowded, charged tuition, and provided no transportation, mill executives lobbied for the creation of a new school district and offered to pay for the school themselves. Despite opposition and a suit that took the issue to the South Carolina Supreme Court, the Parker School District was created by the South Carolina legislature, and Parker High School opened in 1923. Pete Hollis organized the new district and became superintendent.Arial and Smith, 23-30. Depression, boom, and decline During the Depression demand for textiles fell, and mills lowered wages and laid off workers. During the early 1930s, workers were able to work only three days every two weeks. The Roosevelt Administration hoped to institute a forty- hour week, but Marchant lobbied against the idea, traveling to Washington on multiple occasions to argue that Monaghan would \\"go plum broke on forty hours a week.\\" Instead, management instituted what textiles workers called the \\"stretch-out,\\" attempts to increase productivity by having employees work longer and more intensively for no additional pay. Nevertheless, Monaghan Mill continued to operate normally during the national textile workers strike of 1934 after union organizers found the mill gates locked and a troop of National Guardsmen stationed at the gate. World War II brought increased demand, and Monaghan Mill produced cloth for uniforms. Nevertheless, following the war, its new owner, J. P. Stevens and Co. sold mill village houses as too expensive to maintain. Monaghan School burned down in 1954 and the YMCA was torn down in the late 1960s. Other facilities were closed, remodeled, or eliminated, such as the swimming pool and the baseball diamond. Federal government intervention, combined with a growing shortage of white labor, helped desegregate the mills during the 1960s. Nevertheless, African-Americans faced resentment and often had difficulty gaining promotions. Many turned to lawsuits and political activism, including multiple actions against J. P. Stevens, challenging its hiring and promotion policies.Timothy J. Minchin, Hiring the Black Worker: The Racial Integration of the Southern Textile Industry, 1960-1980 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1999), 7, 12-13, 43-45, 67-74. An increasingly global market that included cheaper foreign labor made American textile mills increasingly unprofitable. The former Monaghan mill village became more run down as workers left the area; some houses were left vacant and unkempt. In 1983, the Greenville County Redevelopment Authority began renovations, eventually repairing 134 homes, repaving numerous roads, and redeveloping the old Monaghan School site as the Parker Daycare Center. Conversion to loft apartments In 1988, Monaghan was sold to JPS Converter and Industrial Group, which operated the mill until its closing in 2001. In 2003, Capitol Development Corporation attempted to have the mill re-zoned for use as an apartment complex, but the Greenville County Council denied the request because of insufficient planning and concern about the flammability of the building. Another development company, Monaghan Mills LLC, purchased the property a year later with similar plans. This time rezoning was approved, and in 2004, the South Carolina legislature passed the Textile Communities Revitalization Act, which added an additional 25% tax credit to the 30-39% credit for buildings listed on the National Register. The $15 million Monaghan development received $10.2 million in tax credits.Anna Lee, Historic Conestee, Brandon mills in line for redevelopment,\\" Greenville News, June 23, 2013, 1.

History Colorado. Retrieved May 3, 2013. Overview It is located on 75 acres off of Pawnee Avenue and Iron Mountain Road. The large Queen Anne house is made of red sandstone. It was once a bed and breakfast, but is now privately owned. Dr. Isaac Davis Dr. Isaac Davis, an English physician, moved to Manitou Springs in 1874 and was one of the city's founders. He and his family homesteaded the land that Redstone Castle sits on. The father of 15 owned several businesses in town including a shoe store on Canon Avenue and a pharmacy. His health declined significantly after the Stringler trial of the death of a woman from a morphine overdose. The woman's husband accused the doctor, and he was exonerated. His health continued to decline and as a result he sold his homestead in 1880 or 1881 to two brothers named Davis, but unrelated to the doctor. The purchase agreement included the words: \\"Buyer Beware\\" and carried a stipulation that the graves of \\"early trappers, pioneers, soldiers and vagabonds\\" were to be moved to the new Crystal Valley Cemetery. Davis brothers The Davis brothers built Redstone Castle in 1890 as a model home for an elite development called Manitou Terrace Estates on Iron Mountain. They published ads to attract the wealthy and established colorful billboards in the east of Garden of the Gods, Pikes Peak and Rainbow Falls. None of the lots sold, however, reputedly because buyers learned that the land was haunted. Some believed this was because some, but not all, of the graves had been moved from the hillside to the Crystal Valley Cemetery. Hawkins family The castle was vacant for years. Balem Hawkins was hired as caretaker of the estate and moved in with his family. The family began hearing voices and seeing apparitions. Their dog \\"became nervous and high-strung\\". Hawkins shot a crazed dog that had attacked his wife. According to legend, the dog reappeared and the family heard a dog howling and scratching at the doors in the night. They moved out the next morning. Local legend It is believed by some local residents that Redstone Castle is haunted by Alice Crawford Snow who was an actress, medium and spiritualist. In 1905 Crawford women, including Madame Crawford and Alice Crawford Snow, began leasing Redstone Castle for the summers and conducting seances. Madame Crawford was claimed to have made contact with her daughter Emma Crawford, of the local annual coffin races; Emma's coffin reputedly slid down Red Mountain after a rain. \\"In honor of their benevolent specter, Manitou Springs holds annual Coffin Races and a wake for Emma.\\" In 1910 Alice rented the home on her own to prepare for a role as Lady Macbeth in Denver. She dressed in costume and required others to call her Lady Macbeth. As her behavior became increasingly odd, visitors stopped coming to the home and merchants had a hard time finding delivery boys to bring supplies to her. While she lived at the castle, a friend rescued her during a suicide attempt where she had been shooting at ghosts and shot herself; Attempting to set another ghost on fire, she set fire to her bed clothes. Alice was treated at St. Francis Hospital in Colorado Springs. She left Manitou Springs \\"a bitter and despondent woman\\". Many believe her spirit lives on in the castle.

Life Born in Shkod√´r, baptized by the name Zef to Gjon and Marta Dedaj, originally from the mountains of Shllak. Bernardin Palaj went to Franciscan schools in Shkod√´r, joined the Franciscan order in September 1911, and finished his education in Salzburg, Austria. Ordained as a priest in 1918, Palaj was an organist at the Francisca church in Shkodra from 1916 to 1946, taught Albanian and Latin at the Collegium Illyricum (Illyrian College), and served as parish priest in Pult and Rubik. From April 1923 to December 1924, together with Shuk Gurakuqi, Ndre Mjeda, Gjergj Fishta and Anton Harapi, he edited the Shkodra weekly newspaper Ora e maleva (The mountain times), affiliated with the parliamentary opposition. He was arrested by Zogu in 1924 but released upon the intervention by Archbishop Laz√´r Mjeda. In the period of 1919-1934, he collected folklore from the mountains, material that was published in the leading periodical Hylli i Drit√´s (The Daystar). Together with Donat Kurti, he published K√¢ng√´ kreshnik√´s dhe legenda (Songs of the frontier Warriors and Legends) in the impressive Visaret e kombit (Treasures of the Nation) collection, Tirana 1937. From 1934 to 1941, he also increasingly produced literary works of his own, mostly classical lyric and elegiac verse and short stories. From 1939 to 1944, Palaj served as a police captain under Italian rule and German occupation, though he was apparently ill from 1942 onwards. He also devoted the war years to research on customary law and tribal organisation in northern Albania. His police work under the occupation, whatever form it took, did not endear him to the Partisans. With the Communist takeover in late 1944, Palaj fled to the mountains, but was arrested in Rubik in 1946. Palaj died in prison of tetanus in February or December 1946 before he could be sentenced, and was buried in the courtyard of the sanatorium in Shkodra. Palaj and Donat Kurti were the first to record the Albanian language song 'Gjergj Elez Alia' which was published in Tirana in 1937.

It was written by Mark Gatiss and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes, Martin Freeman as Dr John Watson, and Mark Gatiss as Mycroft Holmes. It also marks the first appearance of Amanda Abbington as Mary Morstan and Lars Mikkelsen as Charles Augustus Magnussen. Inspired by \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\" and \\"The Lost Special\\" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the episode follows Sherlock Holmes' return to London and reunion with John Watson, along with an underground terrorist network. The episode was first broadcast on BBC One and Channel One on 1 January 2014. It garnered a viewership of 12.7 million people and received positive reviews. Plot Two years after his supposed death (depicted in The Reichenbach Fall), Sherlock Holmes has been completely exonerated of the slanderous accusations against him originated by Jim Moriarty and secretly returns to London to help his brother Mycroft uncover an apparent imminent and huge terrorist attack. An interleaved scene shows a version of how Sherlock might have faked his death: by jumping from the roof with a bungee cable, bouncing back and entering the building through a window, leaving Moriarty's body with a Sherlock mask to mislead John and other onlookers, John himself being hypnotised by Derren Brown to give the time for this to be set up (see \\"The Reichenbach Fall\\"¬ßSpeculation and response to the cliffhanger). This version of events is later shown to be a conspiracy theory invented by Philip Anderson, who feels responsible for Sherlock's death. John now has a girlfriend, Mary Morstan (Amanda Abbington), to whom he intends to propose in a restaurant. At this point, Sherlock, disguised as a French waiter, approaches the couple, but is not immediately recognised by John. When Sherlock reveals his identity, John attacks him three times in three different restaurants. When John refuses to accept his explanations, Sherlock enlists Molly to assist him in his next case, that of an underground skeleton behind a desk containing a manuscript: How I Did It by Jack the Ripper, revealed toward the end of the episode to be a fake planted by Anderson to lure Sherlock out of hiding. Later that day, Mary receives a text in a skip code (first and every three words) telling her that John has been kidnapped by unknown assailants and will die if he is not rescued in time, along with a coded location. Sherlock and Mary come to his rescue on a motorcycle and manage to drag him out of a lit bonfire on which a \\"guy\\" (Guy Fawkes effigy) was about to be burned. Sherlock is shown a video by a London Underground employee of a mysterious vanishing of a passenger from a train between two stations near Parliament and later identifies the passenger as a member of the House of Lords, Lord Moran, whom he knows to be a foreign agent and who is also acting unusually. He notices that it is not only Moran who vanished but an entire carriage of the train and deduces that the attack will be on the Houses of Parliament, which will be holding a late-night hearing on a new anti-terrorism bill on Guy Fawkes Night, 5 November. Sherlock and John enter the abandoned station near Parliament, finding the secretly diverted carriage. It is rigged with explosives to make an enormous bomb. Sherlock manages to defuse the bomb by turning the off-switch, but not before making John believe the bomb can't be defused, leading Sherlock to apologize to John for getting him involved and saying that John would have had a future if he hadn't come back. This all had the intended effect of causing John to panic and reveal to Sherlock how much he has missed him, to John's later embarrassment. Another cut-scene intercut with the above shows Sherlock visiting Anderson and revealing to him how he faked his death as part of a plan to persuade Moriarty of his lost credibility and death, allowing him to successfully dissolve Moriarty's network. Sherlock tells Anderson that he and Mycroft had anticipated thirteen possible scenarios that could happen on the roof, and that while John's view was obstructed, members of his Homeless Network rolled out an inflatable mattress and took their roles as shocked bystanders and paramedics. With the aid of a squash ball under his arm to temporarily stop his pulse, Sherlock convincingly faked his own death. Anderson casts doubt on the veracity of this version of events, arguing it would be nearly impossible to ensure John remained exactly where Sherlock wanted. Anderson points out that he is \\"the last person\\" Sherlock would tell, but when he turns around the room is empty. Anderson then begins tearing his theories from the wall, laughing hysterically, and the intercut scene ends. Moran is ambushed by the police and arrested as he leaves his hotel suite. John asks Sherlock who abducted him and why, questions to which Sherlock has no answers yet. In the final scene, a bespectacled man with blue eyes is seen observing footage of Sherlock and Mary rescuing John from the fire.  Sources  The Adventure of the Empty House The most obvious source of this episode, to which its title alludes, is \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\", in which Sherlock Holmes returns from his \\"Great Hiatus\\", having allowed everyone to believe him dead to root out the rest of Moriarty's criminal organisation. In both the story and the episode, Mycroft helps Sherlock fake his demise. The villainous Moran in this episode is named after Colonel Sebastian Moran, the villain of the original story. In \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\", Watson first encounters Holmes disguised as a heavily accented and bearded book salesman with a shop on the corner of Church Street, who offers Watson some books. In the episode, John encounters a man as his patient who owns a DVD shop at the same location; the man offers to sell him pornographic DVDs with titles almost identical to the books Watson was offered by the disguised Holmes in the short story (\\"Tree Worshippers\\", \\"British Birds\\", \\"Catalysts\\", and \\"Holy War\\"). John falsely assumes it is Sherlock in disguise, with embarrassing results. It is also a reference to a scene from The Spider Woman starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. Moffat and Gatiss have cited the film series as another source of inspiration when writing Sherlock. The remainder of the episode's storyline is largely original. Sherlock Holmes alludes to a \\"system of Japanese wrestling\\" as the second of thirteen scenarios that might have allowed him to survive his rooftop encounter with Moriarty. This is a reference to the fictional martial art of \\"baritsu\\" which was used by Holmes to defeat Moriarty in the original story. Other Conan Doyle short stories Apart from \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\", the episode contains allusions to many other Conan Doyle short stories: *Sherlock calls Lord Moran by the code name \\"giant rat of Sumatra Road\\" because of his status as a mole for North Korea, a reference to \\"the giant rat of Sumatra\\" mentioned in passing in \\"The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire\\" and because Moran's planned terrorist attack involves an abandoned section of the London Underground system called \\"Sumatra Road\\". **In \\"The Adventure of the Reigate Squire\\", Watson mentions in passing the case of the \\"Netherland-Sumatra Company and of the colossal schemes of Baron Maupertuis.\\" The episode references this and the repeated mention of \\"Sumatra\\" by similarly featuring a member of the House of Lords, Lord Moran, as the scheming villain. Furthermore, in the beginning of the episode, after Sherlock and Mycroft have returned to London from Serbia, Mycroft mentions Baron Maupertuis by name. *At one point, John asks the bearded man selling DVDs if his usual GP is named \\"Dr Verner\\", who, in \\"The Adventure of the Norwood Builder\\", is a cousin of Sherlock Holmes who buys Watson's practice so he can move back into his old rooms on Baker Street upon Holmes' return. *Sherlock refers to an unseen character called Professor Presbury and \\"monkey glands\\", both from the story \\"The Adventure of the Creeping Man\\". *In \\"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\\", the first story to feature Sherlock's brother Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock mentions that his grandmother was the sister of the French artist Horace Vernet. The fact that Holmes impersonates a French waiter at the beginning of the episode may be a reference to his French heritage. The scene where Sherlock and Mycroft try to out-deduce each other in Sherlock's flat is also a reference to a scene from \\"The Greek Interpreter\\" where they engage in a similar competition while sitting in Mycroft's Diogenes Club. **Sherlock and Mycroft's competition is over analysing a particular knitted hat, a reference to \\"The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\\" where Holmes also deduced several facts about a man from his hat. Furthermore, in the episode, when Mycroft determines that the knitted hat belonged to a man, Sherlock asks, \\"Why, size of the hat?\\", to which Mycroft reproachingly replies, \\"Don't be silly. Some women have large heads, too.\\" Sherlock's subsequent look of guilt is a satirical allusion to the controversial and pseudoscientific phrenology involved in the original short story, where Sherlock Holmes deduced that the owner of the hat was intelligent based on the size of his head, remarking \\"a man with so large a brain must have something in it.\\" *The episode features John's engagement to Mary Morstan, who appears in the novel The Sign of the Four. Mary is seen reading John's blog, and the passage she reads aloud is an almost verbatim excerpt from chapter six of The Sign of the Four (\\"[s]o swift, silent, and furtive were his movements, like those of a trained bloodhound picking out a scent...\\"). *At one point, Mary receives a text message on her mobile phone that starts with the phrase \\"John or James Watson\\", a reference to \\"The Man With the Twisted Lip\\", in which Mary calls her husband \\"James\\" rather than John (prompting the fan theory that his middle initial stands for \\"Hamish\\", a variant of James, a theory incorporated into the earlier episode \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\"). *Mary says that the above-mentioned text message is a skip code, a type of code where each word of the secret message is given as every third word of the apparent message, a reference to \\"The Adventure of the Gloria Scott\\" where Holmes shows and explains to Watson a message with the same type of code. (That Mary knows it is a skip code contributes to Sherlock later identifying her true identity.) *In a short scene, Sherlock very quickly solves an adaptation of \\"A Case of Identity\\" when a young woman consults him about the disappearance of her online boyfriend, determining that it was in fact her stepfather who had posed as her online boyfriend to break her heart, keep her at home in grief, and maintain control over her finances. Mere moments after first hearing the woman's story, Sherlock promptly tells her stepfather, who has feigned concern and joined her in consulting him, that he is \\"a complete and utter pisspot\\", alluding to Holmes's reprimand of the man in the original short story. *The episode also references the Conan Doyle story \\"The Lost Special\\", in which a train goes missing into an unused section of the railway, and which features an unnamed character who might be Sherlock Holmes, referred to simply as \\"an amateur reasoner of some celebrity\\".Doyle, Arthur Conan. \\"The Lost Special.\\" London: 1898. \\"...which would enable them to say for certain what had become of the missing train.\\" Production Casting Many of the cast of the previous two series returned, with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman playing Sherlock Holmes and Doctor John Watson. Freeman's real-life partner Amanda Abbington joined the cast as Mary Morstan, Watson's girlfriend. Cumberbatch's parents, Wanda Ventham and Timothy Carlton, had cameos as Sherlock's parents. Writing \\"The Empty Hearse\\" was written by the series' co-creator, Mark Gatiss. He was inspired to use the London Underground as a setting by the 1968 Doctor Who serial The Web of Fear, a story which is primarily set in the Underground after London is evacuated due to the spread of a deadly web-like fungus via the Tube network. Filming St Bart's Hospital The resolution to how Holmes had faked his death at the end of \\"The Reichenbach Fall\\" was filmed in April 2013 at St Bart's Hospital in London. The filming was attended by several hundred fans, whom producer Sue Vertue begged not to leak too much information. Telegraph journalist Sheryl Garratt reported that the filming was deliberately confusing to the watching fans, and the explanation of how Sherlock faked his death was blanked in the script. The London Underground train used in the episode was built from scratch by the production to look like a District line carriage, as they were unable to acquire a real train. The never completed tube station called Sumatra Road is based on North End tube station. Filming was carried out at Westminster and Charing Cross stations.

The strikers were protesting a cut in tree pruning wages from $1.40 for an eight-hour workday to $1.25 for a nine-hour workday. The strike was characterized by multiple incidences of violence, including a break-in at the Vacaville jail that resulted in the kidnapping and abuse of six arrested strike leaders. The strikers were ultimately unsuccessful in demanding higher wages and fewer hours and the CAWIU voted to end the strike on January 20, 1933.  Background  The Cannery and Agricultural Workers' International Union (CAWIU), formerly known as the Agricultural Workers' Industrial Union (AWIU), was a Communist- aligned union active in California in the early 1930s. Early in its career the CAWIU involved itself primarily in spontaneous agricultural strikes, including the Santa Clara Valley cannery workers strike in July 1931 and the California pea pickers strike in May 1932. However, the union focused little on recruiting and organizing a large group of permanent members. Following the failures of these two strikes the CAWIU leaders realized the difficulty of establishing a solid agricultural labor movement around spontaneous and unplanned uprisings. The CAWIU became more effective in its operating and organizing due to the leadership of Sam Darcy. Darcy became the organizer for District 13 (which included California, Nevada, and Arizona) of the Communist Party USA in 1931. At the time District 13 had a membership of less than 300 and a treasury of $6. Darcy's main focus was organizing California's unemployed and agricultural workers. He immediately began recruiting and training organizers from the working class because he believed they would relate to, and thus more easily recruit, the California farm workers. Darcy felt that the only hope of success for the Communist party in District 13 was to disregard its own political interests in favor of improving the wages and working conditions of the workers. Inspired by Darcy's leadership the CAWIU called a conference of all its members on July 18, 1932, with the purpose of establishing a basis for strong organization. The CAWIU resolved to maintain its headquarters in San Jose as a concentration point from which the union would expand. Second, conference delegates agreed that the union's leadership must be reflective of its membership in terms of race, sex, and age. Third, they agreed that all union activities were to enforce demands regarding wages, working conditions, and union recognition, and that careful organization was necessary for any union action. To ensure that every farm worker could afford membership the delegates established the lowest possible initiation fees and monthly dues. Employed workers paid an initiation fee of 50 cents and unemployed workers paid only 10 cents, while monthly dues were 30 cents for working members and 5 cents for the unemployed. During the months following the San Jose conference CAWIU organizers were greatly active in the three- valley region of Santa Clara, Salinas, and Pajaro, which they selected at the conference for special attention. However, this did not mean that other areas were neglected. For several months a group of CAWIU organizers from Sacramento had been actively recruiting farm workers in Vacaville. When orchardists cut their tree pruners' wages on November 14, 1932, the CAWIU had gained ample influence among local farm workers to call the first prearranged strike in its history.  Timeline   Farm owners cut wages  On November 10 Frank H. Buck announced that the wage for tree pruning would be cut to $1.25 for a nine-hour workday beginning November 14. Buck was Vacaville's largest grower who, just a few days prior on November 8, had been elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives, receiving support from nearly every voting farm worker in his district. This was due to the fact that, prior to his election, Buck publicly announced his intention to pay tree pruners $1.40 for an eight-hour workday while other local orchardists were paying $1.25.  The strike begins  The strike began on November 14, the day Buck's reduced wage rate went into effect, when 400 Spanish, Japanese, Filipino, and white tree pruners walked off their jobs. 250 of the workers were CAWIU members and the others were quickly joining. The union issued its strike demands that same day: a wage of $1.50 for an eight-hour workday, a guarantee of no discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or union activity, and formal recognition of the CAWIU by farm employers. In response, the affected employers offered $1.20 for an eight-hour workday. Unwilling to accept this offer, yet lacking essential resources to sustain the strike, the CAWIU looked to outside help. The Workers' International Relief pledged its full support within a few days and the International Labor Defense offered its services to those workers arrested during the strike.  The first confrontation  The first confrontation of the strike occurred on November 21 when strikers barricaded the main street of Vacaville. Their goal was to prevent trucks carrying strikebreakers from reaching the affected orchards on the outskirts of town. Vacaville police chief O. E. Alley attempted to remove a barricade of boxes and the strikers tried to stop him, thus sparking a confrontation. Police, who were greatly outnumbered, attempted to arrest six strike leaders but eventually released them after being surrounded by a large mob of picketers. No one was hurt in the incident.  Riot on November 25  More than a dozen individuals, including five Vacaville police officers, were injured during a riot between strikers and strikebreakers on November 25. The officers and strikebreakers were attacked, after removing street barricades, while attempting to move their truck through the crowd of strikers. One of the strikers, identified as John Lopez, attacked one of the strikebreakers, identified as Arthur Boom, with pruning shears. Boom leaped from the truck and attacked Lopez, starting a riot between about 300 strikers, strikebreakers, and officers. The officers used clubs to attack the strikers while strikers used pruning shears and rocks as weapons. One officer, Deputy Sheriff George Frazier of Fairfield, was knocked unconscious when struck on the head by a rock. Another unidentified officer had his finger tip bitten off.  Library riot on December 4  On December 4 more than 150 strikers met at the home of John Lopez, the first person to attack during the November 25 riot, and marched together to the city library. The crowd of strikers, led by a front line of young women, chanted and carried banners reading \\"$1.50 and eight hours\\" and \\"Free Donald Bingham,\\" a demonstrator arrested at the November 25 riot. The strikers reached the library where they were met by Vacaville police chief O. E. Alley and a large group of Vacaville citizens. Speeches were given by strike supporters such as James Melgar of Vacaville, Robert Nelson of San Jose, and Nora Conklin of Sacramento, all of whom were eventually arrested that day. The crowd grew to nearly 1000 people, most of them Vacaville townsmen and farm owners. The riot started during a speech by Nora Conklin, an International Defense League worker, who urged the strikers to return to the Lopez home. Banners were ripped from the hands of strikers, sparking a clash between the citizens of Vacaville and the striking workers. Strikers were hit and knocked to the ground, many were injured in the chaos of more than 1000 people, and officers were unable to control the angry crowd. Officers placed twelve individuals under arrest, all of them strikers or speakers, charging them with conducting a meeting without the consent of the city council.  Vacaville jail incident and community response on December 5  The day after the riot at the city library a group of about 30 masked men invaded the Vacaville jail, kidnapped six strike leaders, and drove away with them in seven waiting automobiles, warning journalists and other townspeople not to follow. They drove fifteen miles from the jail where they shaved the strikers' heads, beat them, and covered them with red paint. The kidnappers then turned the strike leaders loose, warned them not to return to Vacaville, and drove off. Police chief O. E. Alley said those who entered the jail had somehow obtained the necessary keys but gave no explanation as to how. Frank H. Buck publicly condemned the act, urging Vacaville residents to proceed with the strike by lawful means. Sheriff's officers also condemned the act but little was done in effort to identify or arrest the kidnappers. The International Labor Defense sent telegrams condemning the incident to California's Governor Rolph, the mayor of Vacaville, and Vacaville police chief O. E. Alley. The telegrams, signed by the International Labor Defense's national secretary William L. Patterson, demanded the immediate arrest of all individuals and town officials involved in the incident. That afternoon it was reported that the Sacramento communists would retaliate in force against Vacaville. The word spread throughout the county and angry citizens from all the towns began to gather in Vacaville to fend off the impending invasion. A large crowd of Solano county citizens gathered in front of the library and listened to speeches by Rev. Arthur F. Fruhling and Judge Bell from Winters. The speeches were on the subject of \\"the real menace to this community,\\" and reaffirmed the resolve of the citizens of Vacaville to protect their town and families.http://www.solanoarticles.com/history/index.php/weblog/more/the_communist_invasion_of_vacaville/  The end of the strike and aftermath  After more than 2 months the CAWIU had exhausted its resources and the strikers' determination to continue the strike had weakened. Intimidation by local antilabor forces, farm owners, and townsmen was taking its toll, relief from outside sources was dwindling, and attendance at strike meetings had drastically fallen. When American Federation of Labor officials sided with employers in the dispute union leaders recognized that the strike had reached its end. At a meeting on January 20 CAWIU members voted to end the strike. The strikers were ultimately unsuccessful in achieving their demands. Union leaders recognized that, in order for it to have been successful, the strike should have been called at harvesttime when farm employers would be under immediate pressure to reach a settlement.  Historical significance  The Vacaville tree pruners' strike saw great displays of anti-communist sentiment from the farm owners and townspeople. Employers gained the support of many Vacaville citizens through appeals to anti-communism. Farmers and local businessmen organized a large anti-communist rally on December 2 where a local churchman (Rev. Arthur F. Fruhling) branded the CAWIU as a tool for Communist corruption in California. They also heard a judge from a nearby town (Judge Bell from Winters) suggest lynching as a means of combatting the \\"red\\" strikers. This anti-communist sentiment was carried on to the Vacaville jail incident three days later when masked men kidnapped six strike leaders and, among other abuses, covered them with red paint. City and county authorities supported the employers' efforts to undermine the strikers. The mayor of Vacaville at the time, who was one of the largest orchardists in the area, facilitated the cooperation between employers and public authorities throughout the strike. Yet despite the efforts of local authorities and employers the strikers were successful in keeping strikebreakers out of the affected orchards during the early weeks of the strike. During the later stages, however, mass picket lines were made up of mostly women and children in an effort to protect male strikers from further violence and physical abuse. For the CAWIU the Vacaville defeat was a setback, but the strike served as a learning experience for successful strike leadership. Under Sam Darcy's leadership a group of new and able organizers had taken over the CAWIU and, by the end of the strike in 1933, the union had gained the attention, respect, and confidence of California farm workers.

See also There have been four separate stations with \\"Shirebrook\\" in their names: *Shirebrook South which is the subject of this article *Shirebrook North which was actually in Langwith Junction, * Shirebrook Colliery (later renamed Shirebrook Colliery Sidings) for colliery workmen's trains only, and *Shirebrook station which is on the Robin Hood Line. Shirebrook South, Shirebrook Colliery Sidings and Shirebrook North have been closed for many years. Shirebrook West closed in 1964 but reopened in 1998 as plain \\"Shirebrook\\". Shirebrook West was actually on the eastern edge of the village. Context The station was built by the GNR as part of their Leen Valley Extension which enabled trains to run from to via Sutton-in- Ashfield, Skegby, Pleasley and Shirebrook South. History The Leen Valley Extension started at Kirkby South Junction where it left the Great Central Main Line. It was opened northwards in stages, with passenger services as far as Skegby commencing with some fanfare on 4 April 1898. The line through Pleasley (later renamed \\"Pleasley East\\") station opened for mineral traffic as far as Shirebrook Colliery on 26 November 1900. Passenger services were extended north of Skegby to Pleasley and Shirebrook (later renamed \\"Shirebrook South\\") on 1 November 1901. The high embankment through the village of Shirebrook which completed the Leen Valley Extension by connecting the GNR's Shirebrook (later \\"Shirebrook South\\") and the LD&ECR;'s Langwith Junction (later \\"Shirebrook North\\") was opened on 29 May 1901. The passenger service then settled down to five trains per day plying between Shirebrook (later Shirebrook South) and Nottingham Victoria, with two extra on Wednesdays and Saturdays. There was no Sunday service. The GCR took the LD&ECR; over in 1907, so after that date The Leen Valley extension joined the Great Central at both ends. Nevertheless, until 1925 local passenger trains ran North from Nottingham Victoria and terminated at Shirebrook (later Shirebrook South), despite Shirebrook North being only a mile further on. To modern eyes this appears like running trains along the East Coast Main line from Edinburgh and terminating at Finsbury Park instead of Kings Cross. From 1925 trains started running the last mile to Shirebrook North, but the writing was already on the wall. The railways in these parts were built primarily to carry coal. Local passenger services were typically loss-making and got in the way of freight traffic. The Shirebrook North - Shirebrook South - Nottingham Victoria service was withdrawn on 14 September 1931. The line remained open for six purposes: * coal * through freight services * local freight services * diversions if the GCML was overloaded or under repair, * special trains, notably for football matches and enthusiasts, and * Summer excursions. Shirebrook South closed for local goods on 4 February 1957. Summer weekend excursions to places such as Skegness continued to call at Shirebrook South up to September 1964, at which point the station became redundant and closed completely. The GCML closed North of Nottingham in September 1966, so diversions also ended, but a last hurrah was a sleeping car service from Marylebone to Glasgow which passed through Shirebrook South in the wee small hours from 1962 to 1964. Collieries closed or rationalised production, for example Pleasley Colliery joined underground with Shirebrook Colliery and sent its coal to the surface that way. At one time coal from Shirebrook Colliery could be sent out via the Leen Valley Extension or via what is now the Robin Hood Line, that, too, was rationalised so it only went the latter way. Through freight dwindled or went by other routes, so fewer trains passed through the Shirebrook South site. A Stephenson Locomotive Society \\"Farewell\\" railtour traversed the line on 4 May 1968.The Railtour Files: via sixbellsjunction The line was closed on 27 May 1968 and has since been lifted. Shirebrook South station has been razed to the ground and the massive embankment between Shirebrook South and NorthShirebrook GNR Embankment on flickr has been removed, with striking visual impact.

For almost three decades, Rojas Pavez worked as the municipal secretary of Pichilemu, and in 1944, along with Jos√© Arra√±o Acevedo and Miguel Larravide Blanco, founded Pichilemu, a newspaper focused in local stories. Biography Rojas Pavez was born on 16 October 1906 in Pichilemu, in current Cardenal Caro Province, Region of O'Higgins, Chile, to Samuel Rojas Polanco and Flor Irene Pavez D√≠az. He completed his primary studies in a school of Chimbarongo, Colchagua Province. Rojas later enrolled to schools in San Fernando and Santiago de Chile to complete his secondary studies. Political career Rojas Pavez first became involved in politics when he was appointed as municipal secretary of the commune of Pichilemu in August 1937 by the Pichilemu City Council, presided by mayor Humberto Llanos Mart√≠nez and composed of regidores Lorenzo Arra√±o Ort√≠z, Carlos Silva Prado, Vicente Richard, and Alberto Morales Moraga. He remained in that position until May 1967, when he resigned to run for regidor of Pichilemu. Eventually elected a regidor, representing the Radical Party, he was elected by fellow regidores the 28th Mayor of Pichilemu; his council was composed of Flavio √Ålvarez Jorquera (segundo regidor), Mario Moraga C√°ceres, Carlos Echazarreta I√±iguez, and Washington Sald√≠as Fuentealba (primer regidor), and his term lasted until May 1971, being succeeded by Sald√≠as Fuentealba. Rojas Pavez's mayorship is remembered for the construction of the Arturo Prat Square (Plaza Arturo Prat), performed in 1967. Pichilemu newspaper Front page of the first edition of Pichilemu, dated 31 January 1944 By the 1940s, Rojas Pavez had the idea of publishing a newspaper in Pichilemu, inspired in the previous publication of two local newspapers by sanfernandino businessman and journalist Augusto A. Ram√≠rez O.: El Puerto, founded on 16 January 1908, and El Marino, founded on 14 January 1917. With the help of journalist Jos√© Arra√±o Acevedo and Miguel Larravide Blanco, Rojas Pavez founded Pichilemu on 25 January 1944. With Arra√±o and Larravide, Rojas sent, as required by law, the governor of Colchagua Province a \\"publication declaration\\" (declaraci√≥n de publicaci√≥n), with a copy to a department of the National Library of Chile. The group published Pichilemu for the first time six days later, on 31 January 1944, and seven other editions were published through that year, reporting World War II events and describing the passing-by of Allies ships through the coast of Pichilemu. Rojas was described in a Pichilemu News article commemorating the 65th anniversary of the founding of Pichilemu as \\"proud[ly] giving his commune an informative written tool so many times dreamed of.\\" A ninth edition was published in 1949, but because of \\"low support of the local commerce, and the blind vision of the [local] authorities,\\" Rojas quit the project. Rojas Pavez's project remained dormant until 1986, when local journalist Washington Sald√≠as asked Rojas to give him the rights to publish a newspaper under the name and legal status of Pichilemu. Rojas gave Sald√≠as the rights, and the latter eventually published the tenth edition of Pichilemu on 31 January 1986, on the 42nd anniversary of the newspaper's founding. The newspaper was published until 1990, completing 29 new editions, and 38 in total since 1944. In 1996, one new edition of Pichilemu was published by lawyer Carlos Carmona Pl√°, who purchased temporary rights to the name. Washington Sald√≠as would, in January 2000, turn Pichilemu into an online newspaper by creating Pichilemu News which, as of May 2013, still credits Rojas Pavez as its founder. Pichilemu News is, according to its editor, the oldest online newspaper of the Region of O'Higgins. Personal life Rojas Pavez married Guacolda Avil√©s Pavez. As of the time of writing of his profile in Pichilemu, on 31 January 1986, Rojas was a widower. The Rojas Avil√©s couple had five children: Patricia, Carlos, Mario, Marcelo, and Ver√≥nica. He died in La Reina, a commune of Santiago, Chile, on 23 August 1994, at age 87.

It is located on Sherbrooke Street West. History Westmount Park in 1908. In 1892, the city of Westmount purchased of land for a park in order to preserve its rustic appearance. A few years later, the park was expanded its boundaries from Sherbrooke Street to Western Avenue (today De Maisonneuve Boulevard). Since its expansion, it has occupied of land. In 1899, Quebec's first public library (Victoria Hall) was built in the park. In 1912, J. Howard Manning landscaped the park on behalf of the city. The park's design was inspired by the work of Frederick Law Olmsted, the landscape architect of Mount Royal. The park was designed around existing natural streams, ravines and wooded areas. Flowerbeds were planted and a bandstand was constructed. In 1964, the park was renovated by the firm McFadzean & Everly. Lawns were decorated, trees were cut and the stream that crosses the park was redeveloped. Features The park has a playground, flower beds, two soccer fields, a Canadian football field, and several tennis courts (both hardcourts and clay courts). A stream winds through the middle of the park and is lined by trees and benches. The Westmount Arena and municipal pool are located in the southwest corner of the park, while the Westmount Public Library and Victoria Hall are located in the northwest corner. The park also features a large floral clock, installed in 1926, measuring six meters in diameter and composed of more than 7,000 ornamental plants.

The film follows Franny Ellis (Anne Hathaway), an anthropology student who returns to New York City after her estranged brother, Henry (Ben Rosenfield), a musician, enters a coma; to revive Henry and repair their relationship, Franny uses her anthropologist instincts. After attending a concert by Henry's favorite musician, James Forester (Johnny Flynn), Franny shares her brother's story with James, who comes to the hospital to play at Henry's bedside. The film premiered in the U.S. Dramatic Competition at the 30th Sundance Film Festival on January 20, 2014, and opened in the United States on January 23, 2015, to mixed reviews from critics.  Plot  Franny Ellis (Anne Hathaway), an anthropology student, returns home from her PhD thesis work in Morocco to see her estranged brother, Henry (Ben Rosenfield), a musician who entered a coma after being hit by a car. To revive Henry and repair their relationship, Franny uses writings from Henry's journal to travel among New York City music clubs, where she takes notes on the phrases and music she observes. She fills Henry's sterile hospital room with familiar sounds and scents. Eventually, Franny meets Henry's favorite musician, James Forester (Johnny Flynn), at his concert, and convinces him to play for Henry. Franny and James explore New York City through Henry's experiences, develop a romantic relationship, and Henry awakens.  Cast   Production  Initially, Franny was written as 19 years old, however after Anne Hathaway came aboard, Barker-Froyland rewrote the part to be that of an older woman, which she notes worked well for the script as it gave Franny more reason to not want to be a musician. Hathaways previous movie Les Mis√©rables required her to adopt a shorter hair style than usual, rather than make her regrow the hair, the director incorporated it into the script. Filming of Song One began in June 2013 in New York City.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack, released by Lakeshore Records on January 13, 2015, contained original scores written by Jenny Lewis and Johnathan Rice of the indie rock duo Jenny & Johnny. Barker-Froyland met with the duo in Los Angeles and, after she listened to \\"Little Yellow Dress\\" before her plane ride to New York, decided that they would create the songs that Flynn would perform in- character. During production, Song One producer Jonathan Demme instructed Lewis and Rice to record its music as Skip Spence recorded his 1969 psychedelic album Oar. The duo wrote eleven songs for the film, though only seven were used in its composition.  Track listing   Release   Box office  Song One premiered at the 30th Sundance Film Festival on January 20, 2014, in the U.S. Dramatic Competition. Later, the film opened in a limited release on January 23, 2015, with $20,200 in gross sales generated from twenty-seven theaters in the United States. , the film has grossed $32,251.  Critical response  Song One received mixed reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 33%, based on 51 reviews, with an average score of 5.29/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Song One has plenty of earnest charm, but that isn't enough to overcome its slight, familiar story.\\" The aggregator Metacritic gave the film a score of 48 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

It is northwest of Duncan and has a distinctive skyline with the two rock bluffs. On top of the highest north bluff is a war memorial. History The mountain was featured in the legends of the creation of the Cowichan First Nation. During the Great Flood one man took refuge on top of Swuqus or Swukas (Prevost) while all the others died. In Sooke, there were two women who also stayed on high ground to escape the waters. When the waters receded they moved up island and found the lone Cowichan man. These three people are the ancestors of the Cowichan tribe. The mount's modern name is a tribute to Captain James Charles Prevost, RN, who served aboard HMS Satellite and was British Commissioner in the San Juan Islands boundary dispute also known as The Pig War. The forest became part of a Municipal Forest established in 1946. Access The mountain is open all year except during periods of high fire hazard. Some of the roads have gates and these may be closed at certain times. There are many trails on the mountain, but none were built or are maintained by the municipality of North Cowichan. There are expansive views of the Gulf Islands and Cowichan Valley from the mountain. It has been used as a launching site for hang gliding, complete with a wind sock. Mount Prevost can be reached from Mt. Prevost Road off Somenos Road. The road to the summit is about 8 kilometres or 20 minutes long.
