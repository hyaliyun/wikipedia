However, Karthik later reveals his actual purpose of coming to India, as he is the son of Bhupathi's (Sampath Raj) sister, who has been staying away from her family for the past twenty-five years. Divya's father and his three brothers abandoned their respective wives and sent them back to their house to live with their own brother Sai Reddy (Sai Kumar), because he refused to marry Bhupathi's sister. However, this was a sacrifice by Sai Reddy because Bhupathi's sister herself confessed that she was in love with someone else, Karthik's father. As it turns out, Bhupathi's sister is none other than Karthik's mother. After seeing the fight of Karthik in an attempt to save Divya from brawlers, Bhupati meets Karthik for a marriage proposal with Divya. Karthik then goes to her village.

They were created by James Mellor, a local industrialist, their design being inspired by the teaching of Emanuel Swedenborg, and are a representation of John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress. Having been neglected in the 20th century, they have been restored and are open to visitors by arrangement. The gardens are listed at Grade II in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens, and contain a number of Grade II listed buildings. History James Mellor senior moved into Hough Hole House with his family in 1786. Mellor was a cotton manufacturer who was planning to build a new cotton mill nearby in the Ingersley Valley. His eldest son, also called James, had been born the previous year. Mellor senior died in 1828 and his son inherited the house and grounds. Mellor junior was a follower of Emanuel Swedenborg, a Swedish philosopher, one of whose concepts was that the natural world is an allegory of the spiritual world. Following this concept, he designed gardens around his house based on John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, an allegory describing the spiritual journey of a Christian through his life. Mellor described the gardens as \\"a Garden of Correspondence relating to things of the World and Scriptural History\\". He built the gardens himself, without help from staff or hired help. The gardens were open to the public, and were visited by thousands of people and remained open for some years after his death in 1891. In the 1920s the house and gardens were rented, and later owned, by two schoolteacher sisters, the Misses Russell. They added plants to the gardens, keeping its basic plan, but by the time that the second Miss Russell died, the gardens has become neglected. In 1978 the gardens were acquired by Gordon and Ruth Humphreys who, with the help of the county archaeologist, restored the gardens to their former state. In the 1990s they were taken over by the Rigby family. The gardens remain in private ownership, and are open to the general public on advertised dates and by appointment. Description The gardens are located to the northwest of the village of Rainow. They are approximately triangular in shape and occupy an area of about . The gardens are entered through a gate on Sugar Lane. The areas in the gardens, and the features they contain, are intended to represent the journey through the life of Christian in John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress. Before entering the garden, the visitor is in their own City of Destruction. The first area is the Slough of Despond, originally a swampy area in Mellor's vegetable garden, now drained, paved, and used as a visitors' car park. The visitor then passes through the Wicket Gate to pass along the side of the house to the House of the Interpreter, formerly Mellor's stables. The path goes up a slope between dry stone walls to represent the Wall called Salvation, and passes on to become the Holy Way. This takes the visitor to the former mill pond that represents the Pool of Siloam. The path leads to a former cross, now a broken pillar, and the Cave of the Holy Sepulchre, where Christian loses the burden of his sin through the overflow hole of the mill pond. By the pond is a summerhouse bearing a plaque describing it as \\"Bethel or the House of God\\". Here Christian is confronted with a choice between three paths, Difficulty, Danger, or Destruction. He is intended to choose the uphill path through the Arbour to the top of the hill of Difficulty. From the top of the hill is a view towards the Palace Beautiful, the back of Hough Hole House. The path leads over the Wobbly Bridge to a potting shed representing the Porter's Lodge, in front of which is a stone lion. Here there is also a reference to the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, the shed representing the cabin, and the bridge representing the breaking ice of the Ohio River over which Eliza escaped with her baby. The path then leads along the side of the pond through the Valley of Humiliation and the Valley of the Shadow of Death. In the pond is a terracotta fish, representing the demon Apollyon. The path passes the Mouth of Hell, a niche by the side of the path, and the Cave at the end of the Valley, an opening covered by a hatch, to Vanity Fair, an area behind the former mill. After this, it passes through the Plain of Ease, by Hill Lucre, to a black pillar representing Lot's Wife, through the Meadow by the River of God, up to a level lawn, By-path Meadow, which was formerly Mellor's tennis court. Originally the path led out of the gardens to a tenant's farmhouse, away, representing Doubting Castle, the view of which is now obscured. Now the path leads down a grassy slope representing the Delectable Mountains, to a stone summerhouse, the Howling House. In the wall of this is a slot acting as an Aeolian harp, and a fireplace to produce smoke to fill the room. Next to this is the Country of Beulah, containing three pedestal tombs of members of the Mellor family. The path crosses the Dark River, goes through a sunken path representing again the Slough of Despond, and past a sundial. The path ends at the Celestial City on Mount Zion, a two-storey building standing on a ridge. The ground floor of this was a barn, and an external spiral staircase leads to the upper floor, which was used as Mellor's chapel. In addition to the Pool of Siloam, other parts of the gardens were given biblical names, including a set of steps called Jacob's Ladder, and Mounts Gerizim, Pisgah and Nebo. Mellor planted the gardens with flowers and shrubs mentioned in the Bible. He also inscribed a number of stones with biblical quotations, and details of the family history, 16 of which have survived. He also created other features, including wooden posts painted with the names of the tribes of Israel, but these have not survived. Appraisal Mellor's Gardens are designated at Grade II in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Grade II listing is given to \\"sites of special interest, warranting every effort to preserve them\\". A number of structures in and around the gardens are designed as Grade II listed buildings. Grade II listed buildings are \\"of national importance and special interest\\". These include Hough Hole House itself, the chapel, and the barn under the chapel.

The story concerns a young boy who may or may not be the Anti- Christ. Synopsis When he was a child, Robbie (Jake Croker) tried to defend his friend Heather (Emily Tennant) from bullying classmates. The attempt ended with one of the bullies dying. Years later Robbie has returned to town and is keen on befriending Heather again, much to the ire of her classmate Greg (Aren Buchholz). However Robbie is also at the center of several strange fatalities in which every victim had an altercation of some sort with him prior to their deaths. Henry (Christian Slater), a defrocked priest, is convinced that Robbie is the Anti-Christ and is set on convincing John Elliott (Vinnie Jones), Heather's father, that Robbie is to blame for everything.

Rutger Hauer and Peter Facinelli were initially attached to star in the film along with Christian Slater. The initial plot description was different from the final product, and Hauer was to portray a priest assisting Facinelli, a detective trying to discover the whereabouts of a murderer. Slater was to star as Facinelli's boss. The initial script was written by Lawrence Salva, but was re-worked into a new script by Matthew Robert Kelly. Jones was later signed to portray detective John Elliott and Slater took on the role of Henry, a defrocked priest. Of filming, Carraway stated that he enjoyed working with Slater on the film and that Jones liked the chance to \\"play something a little different because he always plays the tough guy characters\\". Reception HorrorNews.net wrote a positive review for Way of the Wicked, as they felt that it was \\"one of the better horror movies that [they] have seen recently\\" and cited the film's cast as a highlight. In contrast, Ain't It Cool News panned the movie overall and cautioned readers to \\"steer clear of this bland witch/paranormal outing\\".

It provides centralized control over Git, Mercurial, and Subversion repositories within an organization, with common authentication and permission management. RhodeCode allows forking, pull requests, and code reviews via a web interface. Software RhodeCode is an enterprise source code management platform for Mercurial, Git, and SVN repositories. It also provides a web interface and APIs to control source code access, manage users, and conduct code reviews. The platform applies existing tools and integrations across the whole code base in a unified way. RhodeCode is written in Python using the Pylons Framework. It is run as a standalone hosted application on a dedicated server (or in a private cloud) to manage multiple repositories within an organization. RhodeCode CE is free, with an unlimited number of users and repositories. RhodeCode EE is for-fee and builds enterprise integrations on top of CE. =Features= Team collaboration: * Advanced code reviews. * Side-by-side diffs. * Pull requests. * Inline source code chat. * Full-text code search and source code indexing. * Web-based file adding, editing, deletion. * Code snippets system (pastebin). Repository management: * Unified support for Mercurial, Git, and Subversion. * Fine-grained user management and tools for the access control. * Advanced permission system with IP restrictions. Code security and authentication: * Pluggable authentication system with tokens and LDAP support, Atlassian Crowd, Http-Headers, Pam. * Enterprise authentication options: Active Directory, GitHub/Google/Bitbucket authentication, 2-factor authentication. * Integration with 3rd party issue trackers and CI tools (Jira, Redmine, Jenkins, etc.) =Editions= RhodeCode platform comes in two editions: * RhodeCode CE (Community Edition) is free and open source. It is licensed under the terms of AGPLv3 license, with the source code openly available. * RhodeCode EE (Enterprise Edition) is licensed per user, adds technical support and enterprise authentication on top of RhodeCode CE. =Contributions= RhodeCode CE licensed under the AGPLv3 license. Developers willing to contribute need to sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA), before their changes are merged into RhodeCode's main codebase. RhodeCode has an active community of open source contributors and a developer program. Community discussions are carried out on #Slack channel, Community Portal, and IRC (Freenode). =History= RhodeCode was created in 2010 by Marcin Ku≈∫mi≈Ñski to satisfy his need for a more efficient and secure way to manage source code across Mercurial, Git and SVN repositories behind a firewall in large organisations. RhodeCode was released as open-source software. At the beginning of 2013, RhodeCode Enterprise was created to implement features that enterprise users were requesting. The new version was released in August 2013, which also made parts of the software no longer open source. =Move to open source= Earlier versions of RhodeCode Enterprise were licensed entirely under the GNU General Public License version 3, but in August 2013, RhodeCode 2.0, introduced exceptions for parts of the software distribution. Because RhodeCode had accepted patches from independent developers, contributed under the GPL license, there was a dispute about whether the company had the legal rights to make such change. According to Bradley M. Kuhn of Software Freedom Conservancy, the exception statement is ambiguous and \\"leaves the redistributor feeling unclear about their rights\\". Furthermore, he insists, GPLv3 ¬ß7¬∂4 forbids behaviour of that sort. Instead of pursuing litigation, which might take years, SFC decided to fork the project under the name Kallithea, replacing the non-free files with free ones. Starting 2016, RhodeCode is open source, with source code for RhodeCode CE (Community Edition) openly available under the AGPLv3 license. As the company explains in their blog, with this move they intend \\"to accelerate the pace and scope of innovation on [RhodeCode] platform\\" (rhodecode.com, 2016). RhodeCode EE (Enterprise Edition) has a proprietary business license. Company RhodeCode Inc. is a software company that creates products for enterprise software development. Its source code management and Application performance management products aim at software developers, project managers and devops engineers.

It is the second volume in a trilogy focusing on Detective Bill Hodges, following Mr. Mercedes. The book is about the murder of reclusive writer John Rothstein (an amalgamation of John Updike, Philip Roth, and J. D. Salingerhttps://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/28/finders-keepers-stephen- king), his missing notebooks and the release of his killer from prison after 35 years. The book's cover was revealed on King's official site on January 30. An excerpt was published in the May 15, 2015 issue of Entertainment Weekly. Plot In 1978, petty criminal Morris Bellamy robs and murders acclaimed author John Rothstein for ending his famous Runner trilogy on an unsatisfactory note. Prior to the murder, Rothstein had been in reclusive retirement, never publishing another novel but continuing to write in private. More important than the money he steals, Morris covets Rothstein's invaluable notebooks, which contain two books which properly finish the arc of the Runner series. After the murder, Morris hides Rothstein's cash and Moleskine notebooks in a trunk buried near a creek behind his childhood home. Before he can read the manuscripts, Morris is sentenced to life in prison for another crime. Rothstein's murder is never solved. In the present day, young Peter Saubers now lives in Morris' old home. His father, Tom, was disabled in the events that opened Mr. Mercedes, and the Saubers family is on the brink of financial and emotional ruin. Peter discovers the buried trunk and secretly uses the money to keep his family afloat for the next few years, while gradually becoming engrossed in the Rothstein notebooks. When the money runs out, Pete, now a teenager aware of the true value of his discovery, comes up with a plan to profit from the notebooks. At the same time, Morris, now nearly sixty, has finally been granted parole. He goes to retrieve the buried trunk, only to find it empty. Morris is obsessed with finding the notebooks and learning the ultimate outcome of the Runner series. His search for the notebooks eventually leads him to Peter's family. As a deadly cat-and-mouse game begins, private detective Bill Hodges, the man who brought down the murderous Mr. Mercedes, is gradually drawn into the mystery of the unknown benefactor who helped the Sauberses through their rough patch. He knows young Pete is hiding something, but he doesn't know that the missing piece of the puzzle is the answer to the decades-old cold case ‚Äì John Rothstein's murder. Reception Finders Keepers received mixed to positive reviews. In her review for The Guardian, Alison Flood praised the book as \\"expertly plotted\\" and a \\"fresh take\\" on one of King's favorite subjects ‚Äì \\"the relationship between a writer and their fans.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that while Finders Keepers \\"feels very much like a middle volume,\\" it was still a page-turner, and praised the jumps between time periods and the \\"very appealing trio of crime-solvers who joined forces in 'Mr. Mercedes.'\\" Nick Romeo of The Boston Globe was more critical, faulting the \\"somewhat outlandish plot\\" and how \\"Deeper themes about the power of fiction feel somewhat grafted onto the suspenseful story.\\" Television adaptation The third season of Mr. Mercedes retains the title from the first Bill Hodges book, and follows the events from Finders Keepers. As of April 2020 the TV show has an uncertain future, as the Audience Network closed and it was uncertain whether the show would return for a fourth season.

It tells the story of the Amazons, who ruled over men thanks to the sacred girdle of Diana, and Hercules who came to steal it. The film is based on a 1932 Broadway production of Julian Thompson's 1924 play that starred Katharine Hepburn in the lead role. Production of Broadway play The Broadway play of the year before is considered as one of the breakthrough roles of Katharine Hepburn. It was a revival of a 1924 play by Julian F. Thompson (the play would re-appear in 1942 as By Jupiter). The film version was made with an entirely different cast and music. Plot In Pontus, the land of the Amazons, the gender roles and natures are completely reversed. Women are the strong sex, thanks to the sacred girdle of the goddess Diana (Roman names are used). It is in the care of queen Hippolyta and her sister Antiope (in the 1932 production played by Katharine Hepburn), the commander of the female armed forces. The men stay at home and take care of the children. Only Sapiens, the new husband of queen Hippolyta, advocates men's rights. Just like the relationships are reversed, so too are the Greeks for the Amazons a legendary race that probably doesn't exist, instead of the other way around. This is about to change when two Greeks come to court to announce that Hercules needs to get the girdle of Diana to complete his twelve labours. In reality, Hercules may not be much of a threat, but his friend Theseus certainly is. Meanwhile, Sapiens, using his male wiles, is secretly trying to wreck the Amazon's defense from within. Eventually he manages to capture Hercules, and let him escape with the girdle. Without it, the Amazons lose the battle and the gender dynamic shifts to roles matching the social mores of the 1930s.

It was originally released on 23 June 2014 by the label InsideOut Music. Background When scheduling conflicts postponed an intended 2014 album by Bowness' main band No-Man, Bowness collated the songs written for that album and reworked them for a solo record. Many of the elements of the original No-Man project remained on the finished album, with Bowness‚Äô No-Man partner Steven Wilson remaining as sound mixer and sounding board (as well as making occasional instrumental contributions) and with the entire No-Man live band making substantial contributions across the record. Bowness wrote six songs for the project (two of which ended up on the bonus disc) and co-wrote two with Henry Fool and No-Man live keyboardist Stephen James Bennett. The song 'Waterfoot' resulted from a collaboration with contemporary composer/arranger Andrew Keeling, while 'Songs of Distant Summers' was co-written with Stuart Laws. The song 'Beaten By Love' had previously appeared on No-Man's live album Love And Endings in 2012. Additional performers on the album included King Crimson drummer Pat Mastelotto, Porcupine Tree bassist Colin Edwin and Trans-Siberian Orchestra violinist Anna Phoebe.

Cambridge: J. R. Rice, 2017. Print. Entrance length refers to the length of the entry region, the area following the pipe entrance where effects originating from the interior wall of the pipe propagate into the flow as an expanding boundary layer. When the boundary layer expands to fill the entire pipe, the developing flow becomes a fully developed flow, where flow characteristics no longer change with increased distance along the pipe. Many different entrance lengths exist to describe a variety of flow conditions. Hydrodynamic entrance length describes the formation of a velocity profile caused by viscous forces propagating from the pipe wall. Thermal entrance length describes the formation of a temperature profile. Awareness of entrance length may be necessary for the effective placement of instrumentation, such as fluid flow meters. Hydrodynamic entrance length  The hydrodynamic entrance region refers to the area of a pipe where fluid entering a pipe develops a velocity profile due to viscous forces propagating from the interior wall of a pipe. This region is characterized by a non-uniform flow. The fluid enters a pipe at a uniform velocity, then fluid particles in the layer in contact with the surface of the pipe come to a complete stop due to the no-slip condition. Due to viscous forces within the fluid, the layer in contact with the pipe surface resists the motion of adjacent layers and slows adjacent layers of fluid down gradually, forming a velocity profile. For the conservation of mass to hold true, the velocity of layers of the fluid in the center of the pipe increases to compensate for the reduced velocities of the layers of fluid near the pipe surface. This develops a velocity gradient across the cross section of the pipe. = Boundary layer = The layer in which the shearing viscous forces are significant, is called the boundary layer. This boundary layer is a hypothetical concept. It divides the flow in pipe into two regions: # Boundary layer region: The region in which viscous effects and the velocity changes are significant. # The irrotational (core) flow region: The region in which viscous effects and velocity changes are negligible, also known as the inviscid core. When the fluid just enters the pipe, the thickness of the boundary layer gradually increases from zero moving in the direction of fluid flow and eventually reaches the pipe center and fills the entire pipe. This region from the entrance of pipe to the point where the boundary layer covers the entire pipe is termed as the hydrodynamic entrance region and length of the pipe in this region is termed as the hydrodynamic entry length. In this region the velocity profile develops and thus the flow is called the hydrodynamically developing flow. After this region, the velocity profile is fully developed and continues unchanged. This region is called the hydrodynamically fully developed region. But this is not the fully developed fluid flow until the normalized temperature profile also becomes constant. In case of laminar flow, the velocity profile in the fully developed region is parabolic but in the case of turbulent flow it gets a little flatter due to vigorous mixing in radial direction and eddy motion. The velocity profile remains unchanged in the fully developed region. Hydrodynamic Fully Developed velocity profile Laminar Flow : \\\\frac{\\\\partial u(r,x)} {\\\\partial x}=0 \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow u=u(r) (where x is in the flow direction). The developing velocity profile of a fluid entering a pipe. = Shear stress (\\\\tau _w ) = In the hydrodynamic entrance region, the wall shear stress (œÑw ) is highest at the pipe inlet, where the boundary layer thickness is the smallest. Shear stress decreases along the flow direction. That is why the pressure drop is highest in the entrance region of a pipe, which increases the average friction factor for the whole pipe. This increase in the friction factor is negligible for long pipes. In fully developed region the pressure gradient and the shear stress in flow are in balance. Variation of Shear Stress with distance from the entry point. = Calculating hydrodynamic entrance length = The length of the hydrodynamic entry region along the pipe is called the hydrodynamic entry length. It is a function of Reynolds number of the flow. In case of laminar flow, this length is given by: L_{h,laminar}=0.05R_eD Where, R_e is the Reynold's number and D is the diameter of the pipe. But in the case of turbulent flow, L_{h,turbulent}=4.4D(R_e)^{1/6} Thus, the entry length in turbulent flow is much shorter as compared to laminar one. In most practical engineering applications, this entrance effect becomes insignificant beyond a pipe length of 10 times the diameter and hence it is approximated to be : L_{h,turbulent}\\\\approx 10D Other authors give much longer entrance length, e.g. * Nikuradse recommends 40 D Nikuradse, J., Gesetzm√§√üigkeiten der turbulenten Str√∂mung in glatten Rohren, Forschung auf dem Gebiet des Ingenieurwesens, 3, 1932, 1‚Äì36, (Translated in NASA TT F-10, 359,1966. * Lien et al. recommend 150 D for high Reynolds number turbulent flow. = Entry length for pipes with non-circular cross-sections = In case of a non-circular cross- section of a pipe, the same formula can be used to find the entry length with a little modification. A new parameter ‚Äúhydraulic diameter‚Äù relates the flow in non-circular pipe to that of circular pipe flow. This is valid until the cross sectional area shape is not too exaggerated. Hydraulic Diameter is defined as: D_h=\\\\frac{4A}{P} Where, A is the area of cross-section and P is the Perimeter of the wet part of the pipe = Average velocity of fully developed flow = By doing a force balance on a small volume element in the fully developed flow region in the pipe (Laminar Flow), we get velocity as function of radius only i.e. it does not depend upon the axial distance from the entry point. The velocity as the function of radius comes out to be: u(r)=- \\\\frac{R^2}{4\\\\mu} \\\\frac{dP}{dx}(1-\\\\frac{r^2}{R^2}) Where \\\\frac{dP}{dx}=constant By definition of Average velocity, V_{avg}=\\\\frac{\\\\int u \\\\mathrm {d}A}{A_c} where A_c is Area of cross section Thus, V_{avg}=\\\\frac{2}{R^2}\\\\int_0^R u(r)r \\\\mathrm {d}r =-\\\\frac{2}{R^2}\\\\int_0^R \\\\frac{R^2}{4\\\\mu}\\\\frac{dP}{dx}(1-\\\\frac{r^2}{R^2})r \\\\mathrm{d}r =-\\\\frac{R^2}{8\\\\mu}\\\\frac{dP}{dx} For fully developed flow, the maximum velocity will be at r=0. Thus, U_{max}=2V_{avg}  Thermal entrance length  The thermal entrance length describes the distance for incoming flow in a pipe to form a temperature profile of stable shape. The shape of the fully developed temperature profile is determined by temperature and heat flux conditions along the inside wall of the pipe, as well as fluid properties. = Laminar flow = For laminar flow, the thermal entrance length is a function of pipe diameter and the dimensionless Reynolds number and Prandtl number. (\\\\frac{x_{fd,t}}{D})_{lam} \\\\approx 0.05 Re_DPr Re_D = {\\\\text{Reynolds Number}} {\\\\text{Pr}} = {\\\\text{Prandtl number}} The Prandtl number modifies the hydrodynamic entrance length to determine thermal entrance length. The Prandtl number is the dimensionless number for the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity. The thermal entrance length for a fluid with a Prandtl number greater than one will be longer than the hydrodynamic entrance length, and shorter if the Prandtl number is less than one. For example, molten sodium has a low Prandtl number of 0.004, so the thermal entrance length will be significantly shorter than the hydraulic entrance length. For turbulent flows, thermal entrance length may be approximated solely based on pipe diameter. (\\\\frac{x_{fd,t}}{D})_{turb} \\\\approx 10 where: x_{fd,t} = {\\\\text{thermal entrance length}} {\\\\text{D}} = {\\\\text{pipe inside diameter}} = Heat transfer = The development of the temperature profile in the flow is driven by heat transfer determined conditions on the inside surface of the pipe and the fluid. Heat transfer may be a result of a constant heat flux or constant surface temperature. Constant heat flux may be caused by joule heating from a heat source, like heat tape, wrapped around the pipe. Constant temperature conditions may be produced by a phase transition, such as condensation of saturated steam on a pipe surface. Newtons law of cooling describes convection, the main form of heat transport between the fluid and the pipe: q_s=h(T_s-T_m) where: q_s= {\\\\text{heat flux into fluid}} h = {\\\\text{convection coefficient}} T_s = {\\\\text{Surface Tempurature}} T_m = {\\\\text{Mean Stream Tempurature}} Constant surface heat flux result in T_s-T_mbecoming a constant as the flow develops and constant surface temperature results in T_s-T_m approaching zero. = Thermally fully developed flow = Unlike hydrodynamic developed flow, a constant profile shape is used to define thermally fully developed flow because temperature continually approaches ambient temperature. Dimensionless analysis of change in profile shape defines when a flow is thermally fully developed. Requirement for thermally fully developed flow: \\\\frac{\\\\partial} {\\\\partial x}\\\\biggl(\\\\frac{T_s-T}{T_s-T_m}\\\\Biggr)_{fd,t}=0 Thermally developed flow results in reduced heat transfer compared to developing flow because the difference between the surface temperature of the pipe and the mean temperature of the flow is greater than the temperature difference between surface temperature of the pipe and the temperature of the fluid near the pipe boundary.  Concentration entrance length  The concentration entrance length describes the length needed for the concentration profile in a flow to be fully developed. The concentration entrance length can be determined by relating it to the hydrodynamic entrance length with the Schmidt number or by experimental techniques.J. Electrochem. Soc. 160 (2013) E5-E11; doi:10.1149/2.015302jes The Schmidt number describes the ratio of momentum diffusivity to mass diffusivity. x_{fd,c} \\\\approx 0.05 DRe_dSc where: x_{fd,c} = {\\\\text{concentration entrance length}} {\\\\text{D}} = {\\\\text{pipe inside diameter}} Re_d= {\\\\text{Reynolds Number}} {\\\\text{Sc}} = {\\\\text{Schmidt number}}  Applications  Understanding the entrance length is important for design and analysis of flow systems. The entrance region will have different velocity, temperature, and other profiles than exist in the fully developed region of the pipe. = Flow meters = Illustration of a Venturi flow meter, an example of a differential-pressure flow meter. Many types of flow instrumentation, such as flow meters, require a fully developed flow to function properly. Common flow meters, including vortex flow meters and differential-pressure flow meters, require hydrodynamically fully developed flow. Hydraulically fully developed flow is commonly achieved by having long, straight sections of pipe before the flow meter. Alternatively, flow conditioners and straightening devices may be used to produce the desired flow. = Wind tunnels = Wind tunnels use an inviscid flow of air to test the aerodynamics of an object. Flow straighteners, which consist of many parallel ducts which limit turbulence, are used to produce inviscid flow.Farell, C., Youssef, S., 1996. Experiments on turbulence management using screens and honeycombs. ASME J. Fluids Eng. Entrance length must be considered in the design of wind tunnels, because the object being tested must be located in the irrotational flow region, between the flow straighteners and the entrance length.  Exit length  Similar to the development of flow at the entrance of the pipe, the flow velocity profile changes before the exit of a pipe. The exit length is much shorter than the entrance length, and is not significant at moderate to high Reynolds numbers. Hydraulic exit length for laminar flows may be approximated as: (\\\\frac{x}{D})_{Lam} \\\\approx \\\\frac {1}{2} , \\\\text {Low Re} (\\\\frac{x}{D})_{Lam} \\\\approx 0 , Re > 100 x = {\\\\text{exit length}} {\\\\text{D}} = {\\\\text{pipe inside diameter}} Re = {\\\\text{Reynolds Number}}  See also  * Fluid Dynamics * Laminar Flow * Turbulent Flow * Viscosity * Heat Transfer  References  Category:Fluid dynamics ","title":"Entrance length"},{"id":"43067668","text":"Epichoristodes imbriculata is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

Biography Sagnotti earned a Laurea in Electrical Engineering from the University of Rome \\"La Sapienza\\" in 1978 (advisors: Bruno Crosignani and Paolo Di Porto); and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from Caltech in 1983 (advisor: John H. Schwarz). He was Post-Doctoral Fellow at Caltech (1983‚Äì84) and Miller Research Fellow at U.C. Berkeley (1984‚Äì86). Sagnotti was Junior Faculty at the University of Rome \\"Tor Vergata\\" from 1986 to 1994, then Associate Professor (1994‚Äì99) and Professor (2000-2005). His research activity has been devoted to the quantization of the gravitational field, to String Theory, to Conformal Field Theory and to Higher-Spin Gauge Fields. Sagnotti's main contribution to physics is perhaps the analysis of the 2-loop divergences in Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Moreover, he was the first to propose, in 1987, that the type I string theory can be obtained as an orientifold of type IIB string theory, with 32 half-D9-branes added in the vacuum to cancel various anomalies and offered the elucidation of the key properties of orientifold constructions and of Conformal Field Theory on non-orientable surfaces. He also discovered the 10D \\"0B' string\\", including both open and closed strings, non supersymmetric but free of tachyons. He has worked extensively on higher spins, arriving at a geometric formulation of their free field equations in terms of higher-spin curvatures. More recently, Sagnotti has been working on the proposal of a possible link between \\"brane supersymmetry breaking\\", and the onset of the inflationary phase, and on the exploration of some of its possible imprints on the CMB, in particular, the proposal that the low value of the CMB quadrupole and a first peak for l ~5 be a manifestation of the onset of the inflationary phase.  Awards and honors  Sagnotti received the Carosio Prize from the University of Rome ‚ÄúLa Sapienza‚Äù in 1979, a Miller Fellowship from U.C.

In 1982, several early season NSWRL games were played on a Friday night, however regular non-weekend football began as Monday Night Football in 1985, with Canterbury meeting Manly on 24 June. However moderate attendances and a night game prior to a working day eventually saw the game shifted to Friday from 1988 on. As with Monday Night Football, regular Friday fixtures only commenced in the latter half of the season, due to the midweek competition. By 1990, a Friday night game was usually scheduled in all rounds. The Friday night game is considered to be the most watched game of the week and many NRL clubs have openly stated that they appreciate the publicity given by these matches. The Nine Network choose the game they consider to be the \\"match of the round\\" 5 or 6 weeks in advance. This system has both positive and negative consequences, as it increases the likelihood of a good game played between two in-form sides, but does not allow fans or clubs a large amount of time to know on which day they will play in any given round. Broadcast history The Nine Network has broadcast Friday Night NRL games since 1988. As of 2007 the Nine Network now broadcasts two NRL games in New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory on Friday Night - one live at 7.30, and the second match replayed at 9.30. Whichever of the two matches is televised first can depend on which teams are playing, for example, a match involving a Queensland-based team would in most cases be televised first into Queensland, and delayed in New South Wales; conversely, a match involving a New South Wales based team is usually televised first into New South Wales, and delayed in Queensland. In the past, a Nine News or Nightline update separated the two broadcast matches, however in 2008 this was discontinued. In 2010, it was reinstated, before it was again scrapped. From Round 5 of the 2012 NRL season, GEM, a sister station of the Nine Network, started showing Friday night NRL matches live into Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, pitting it against the Seven Network's live AFL coverage in those states.Government approves NRL on GEM outside NSW, Qld.  TV Tonight This allows Victorian NRL fans to see live games involving the Melbourne Storm if they are scheduled on a Friday night. From Round 4 of the 2014 NRL season, for yet unexplained reasons GEM stopped showing the NRL on Friday nights and Sunday afternoons live into Adelaide, with the coverage for all games on Nine reverting to the after midnight 'graveyard shift'. As the change was unannounced and in Adelaide only (the rest of South Australia still receives the live coverage), this has angered many fans in the city, both South Australians and those who have re-located from NSW or Qld. Theme songs The theme song for NRL coverage has been altered throughout the years. In 2000, Friday Night Football used the song, Friday on My Mind (sung my Vanessa Amorosi and Lee Kernaghan) to open the coverage. Since 2002, it has been opened by the Wide World of Sport's banner. The popular \\"That's My Team\\" theme used by the NRL was the backdrop for the openers from 2003-06. In 2007, End Of Fashion's song The Game was used, whilst in 2009 and 2010 Children Collide's song Social Currency was used. In 2011, the NRL's main theme song, Bon Jovi's This is Our House, was used.

This Gothic church was built approximately between years 1360‚Äì1390. The church was established by Charles IV in 1362. Nowadays Roman Catholic Church is located here but it was administrated also by the Chemin Neuf community. The church is protected as a cultural heritage since 1958.  History  The hill Vetrov was connected to Charles IV New Town of Prague in 1348. Charles IV arranged the transfer of a canonical college there in 1362. The canonical college was transferred from Sadska to Prague hill of St. Apollinaire after the agreement between Charles IV and Prague archbishop Arnost of Pardubice in 1362. This event initiated the construction of the church. It is possible that there used to be a chapel of St. Giles, but if it was true, it was completely removed away and the church of St. Apollinaire does not refer to it. = Construction of the church = There were two periods of the construction of the church. The longitudinal hall nave with five bays was built during the first period, approximately between 1360 and 1376. A small tower was located on the saddleback roof and thus the nave could temporarily work as an individual church, although it did not yet possess a presbytery. The construction of a tower on the southern part of the church was initiated after several years. The presbytery was finished during the second period, approximately in the second quarter of the 14th century. The whole church was finished in 1390. = History= The original chapter of St. Apollinaire consisted of a provost and eight canons. The chapter house was connected to the church by its entry straight to the platform on the east side of the church. Around 1419 the chapter left the church, except for one canon, Peter of Kromeriz, who joined the Hussites. It could be one of the reasons why the church stayed undamaged during the Hussitism movement. There was a church school between years 1414‚Äì1418. One of the Hussite military groups from eastern Bohemia, the so- called Orebits, who occupied Vysehrad, used the monastery as their base in 1420. After that the church was used by Ultraquists. The members of the chapter of St. Vitus did not use the church and church services stagnated, so in 1498 the king Vladislaus II of Hungary ruled that the chapter of St. Apollinaire had to sustain paid replacements for churchmen. Those replacements had to administer parishes. The king confirmed the connection of the chapters of St. Vitus and St. Apollinaire in 1503. Rudolf II devolved the church and its property to New Town for 1000 Meissen kops and for the promise of upkeep of the building and church services in 1599. New Town used and maintained premises up to 1628. During that time it assured the restoration of the presbytery and a new bell was made. After that the emperor Ferdinand II ruled to return the church to the St. Vitus Catholic chapter in 1628. The church was damaged by a strong gale which destroyed the glazing of the windows and knocked down the tower which lead to damaging of roof frames in the late 1670. The church was reconstructed during next year by dean Jan Frantisek from Talmberk, but in the baroque style. New baroque style tower with cupola and new baroque interior was most probably created by Daniel Rynd. The former dean of the church established a new altar of Staroboleslav's Mother of God in nave in 1671. In 1689 the interior of the church was damaged by the Protestants and in 1747 the west window and the portal below were walled up on the occasion of building a new adjacent house. In 1757 the church was occupied by the Prussian army which had established a temporary weapon workroom there. During the struggle for the church plastering and masonry were damaged. Restoration of especially interiors followed. = Restoration =  Baroque Style (1671 and 1757‚Äì1768)  The first baroque period took place in connection with the repairs of the church in 1671. The reason for the repair was damage by the strong gale in 1670 which damaged the tower, roof frames and glazing of the windows. The new tower with cupola and baroquization of the interior were probably the work of builder Daniel Rynd. In this period the great bell from 1620 was re-poured by the bellfounder Nicholas Loewe. Also the altar of Staroboleslav's Mother of God was restored. The second baroque period of reconstruction is related with occupying of the church by the Prussian military in 1757. Those struggles for the church and tests of weapons caused the damage of the masonry and plastering. Restorations were made mainly in the interior. New altars were set. Two new bells were cast by Jan Jiri Kuehner to the tower ‚Äì bigger bell Apollinaire and smaller one Anna. The set of the new organ with sculptures of St. Wenceslas and two angels on the old gothic platform in the west nave was the important intervention in 1768.  Neo- gothic Style (1893‚Äì1898)  Some heavy rifts were detected in the construction of the church in the 19th century. This was a reason for general reconstruction of the church made by architect Mocker. He tore down the old gothic platform in the west part and replaced it with a replica. In the windows of the nave he replaced old tracery for the new ones. Both northern portals were changed. The main portal was only fixed by Mocker but the other one smaller lancet arch is Mocker's pseudogothic replacement for the original gothic portal. New doors were set up in both portals according to Mocker's plans. The west gable wall of the nave was torn down and replaced. The whole building got new roof frames. Weathered blocks in the exterior were replaced and the church was plastered. Principal moulding was made in pseudogothic style. Mocker revealed the original gothic wall painting and probably also the original polychromium plated of the arch groins and girders in the interior. In the southern wall of the presbytery he perforated a new portal which he led to the new built pseudogothic sacristy. The sacristy was connected to the choir by the hall of stones. He adjusted the enter under the choir to the tower. In the tower he fixed the inner staircase. = The nave = One nave with narrower five sided presbytery and side tower by the southwestern corner is in the ground plan of the church. The quadratic sacristy with entrance hall completes the construction. The ground plan is created by a long rectangle made from five bays. The exterior of the nave is relatively stern, decorated by only ten massive load-bearing pillars. These pillars are reinforced by sandstones blocks and strapped in lower third with shaped moulding. On the tops of rests there is a combination of the counter and saddle shelters. Corner load-bearing pillars are built diagonally. Great windows of the nave provide great illumination of space of the church. Wide trough stone moulding is original. There are visible also some stonemasons' marks. There used to be a window in the western side of the church which was walled up in the 16th century and nowadays it is hidden under the plastering. The nave is ended by steep triangular gable walls in the west and the east. The western gable wall is segmented by three pointed sunken niche. Two entrance portals lead to the nave from the north. Large cross-shaped ribbed arch is one of the most important parts of inner space. It has nearly semi-circular slightly pointed profile. Stone pear groins fit on the wall's five sided tracery console and on the tops they are tied by moderately appearing circular pins. Pseudogothic gallery on the west of the nave is created by two pointed profiled arcades with central pillars culminate with parapet decorated by fields of odd traceries. Semi-pillar is approaching to the central pillar and carries profiled socle of an oriel which was originally set as platform altar. The organs located on the church-gallery are from the end of the 19th century. = The Presbytery = Ground plan is created by crosswise fields and deep five sided ending. The presbytery is located on the same socle as the nave. It is supported by eight load-bearing pillars similar to more tiny rests supporting the nave. The windows in the presbytery are narrower than the windows in the nave and they fill only two sectioned tracery. The windows sit on the window sill on the profiled moulding as same as in the nave. The moulding is also in the presbytery where narrow shafts of the arch ascend from the mouldings. Sculptural decorated heads are situated on the tops of the shafts. On the top of the column heads are closed by slight polygonal profiled covering slabs and pear ribs derive from those slabs. The ribs are attached to the target pins. The whole arch is completed by crosswised ribs in a semi-circle and creates the impression of a spreading arch. The presbytery is connected with the nave by the stone pointed triumphal arch sitting on the profiled socle with reciprocally cut deeply channelled tracery. The floor of the presbytery and the nave are covered with plasters. = The tower = Ground plan of the tower is squared and it connects to the nave in western field of the north side. The tower stands on the same socle as the rest of the church. Its pointed masonry is plastered and on the individual groins we can spot revealed cubiform reinforce. The construction is divided into two parts. The first part is horizontally divided into three parts. The walls of the bottom part are smooth without any windows. The central and also the biggest part contains two rectangular windows in the south and one window in the east. There are three big pointed windows on the upper part and lead to the south, east and west. There is rectangular slit window heading to the north. The second part is created by gothic octagon. Its walls are divided by four windows with stone jamb. The tower ends by steep pyramidal column roof. The space under the tower used to serve as sacristy. During the regothisation this function in this space was stopped. The tower is filled by the stone staircase from the 19th century. It is held by four pillars. Considering the mightiness of the staircase the cross arch in the first floor was removed. Despite the reconstruction in the 19th century the second floor has its cohesive space with brick ground and beam ceiling from the period of regothisation. There is a bell tower inside the gothic octagon which contains where is nowadays the only bell St. Apollinaire. The bell is decorated by vegetable ornaments and a relief of St. Apollinaire. There is also a Latin inscription with chronograms carved into the bell. = Equipment = The equipment was taken mostly from the near temple of Virgin Mary in Karlov in 1780.  The presbytery  The whole ending of the presbytery is taken by the main altar Assumption of Virgin Mary in Karlov. The altar, which is dated back to 1740‚Äì1744, is brought from Karlov. Its tabernacle contains a small carving of Golgota from 1800. There are statues of angels situated on both sides of the tabernacle. There is a statue of Virgin Mary above the tabernacle carried away to the heaven where her coronation is awaiting by the Holy Trinity. Four Evangelists are standing on the main moulding. All of those statues reportedly come from the workshop of Richard Prachner, very important sculptor (we can find his works in many places in Prague, for example in the Brevnov monastery). Two big tin candlesticks are situated in front of the altar and is from the second half of the 17th century. The next altar in the presbytery, the altar of Golgotha, is situated on its southern side. It is decorated by the statues of the Virgin Mary and Saint John the Evangelist which come most likely from the Czech Baroque sculptor J. A. Quitainer from 1730. The altar table is covered by a drape from the 18th century, the so-called antependium. There is a coffer inside the altar table with the remains of monks who were killed in 1611, which also comes from Karlov. There is an original Gothic sanctuarium in the southern wall of the presbytery, late Renaissance sanctuary with massive forged small doors is situated in the north wall. On the north wall of the presbytery are two paintings: the twelve-year-old Jesus in the temple and Christ and two adulterous women. Both paintings were painted by the Austrian painter M. V. Halbax.  The nave  There is a rococo pulpit from 18th century next to the triumphal arch separating the nave and the presbytery. The ambon is decorated by the scene with two angels which should symbolize the Silence and Life of st. John of Nepomuk. On the small roof of the pulpit there are three more statues of angels. One of them holds bishop's mitre of st. Apollinaire. Statues of little angels come from sculptor R. Prachner. The small roof is ended with a statue of St. John of Nepomuk, apparently made by Czech-Austrian sculptor I. Platzer. Two side altars are symmetrically situated next to triumphal arch. The altar of Virgin Mary from Karlov is on the south side and altar of the birth of Christ on the north side. Altar on the south side was brought from Karlov. It comes from the end of the first half of the 18th century. It is the board-type altar. It is decorated with bent volutas or statues of St. Wenceslas and John of Nepomuk. Those statues come apparently from the workshop of Prague sculptor J. Slanzovsky. There's a painting of Virgin Mary from Karlov between statues. It was painted in 1697 by the Czech- German painter J. J. Heinsch. Heinsch was inspired by the picture of breasts of Virgin Mary which is included in northern nave altar. This painting is known as secret. Pregnant women prayed to it and offered a lot of gold and silver object to it. Part of the attachment of the altar is a painting of Virgin Mary from Pasov. It is a copy of the painting from the first half of the 18th century. The second mentioned side altar of Birth of Christ from 1730-40 is apparently original. The same pattern repeats same as the pattern used at the altar on the southern side. In the centre there is title painting surrounded by two statues of St. Andrew and st. Nicholas. There is also a copy of the painting of Virgin Mary Pasovska in the attachment of the altar. One more work of art ‚Äì painting of the breasts of Virgin Mary ‚Äì is situated in a brass gilt frame and it was brought from Karlov. This work was made by painter J. C. Monnot. There is a grave ledger of Juliana Dlouhoveska from 1671. It is located in the south wall of the nave. There's also a tin baptismal font formed as reversed bell and stands on three legs with paws and heads of beavers. The walls of the nave are decorated by the original gothic frescos from the period so called beautiful style from the end of the 14th century. On the southern wall frescos depict Jesus Christ handing a keys over to st. Peter. Both characters surrounded by Apostles are having bosoms of prophets under their feet. There is Virgin Mary depicted standing and wearing a safety coat surrounded by six female saints from each side on the opposite side. Also those saints are having similar bosoms under their feet as on the south side.  Curiosities  We can find a hypothesis in some sources about the location of significant buildings built in the period of Charles IV. They are set by a lot of field-geometrical relations and a Christian mysticism. The five New town churches established by Charles IV. create a regular crucifix. Branch from north to the south creates a connecting line of Church of St. Catherine and Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary Na Slupi, branch from west to east Church of Virgin Mary and St. Charles the Great and Emauzy Monastery. Those branches cross in Church of st. Apollinaire. Towers of churches Na Tr√°vn√≠ƒçku, st. Apollinaire, Catherine's stand in one line and they have the same architectonic characteristic. This hypothesis leads to speculations that location of these churches was planned in the original project of the city, although those individual church buildings were built in this part of New Town one by one (Slovany 1347, Karlov 1352, Catherine 1355, Travnicek 1360, Apollinaire 1362). The cross of those buildings meant an unusual blessing to the town. There is a modern legend about the origin of the chapter: ‚ÄûBorivoj II. who had a conflict with his brother Vladislaus was arrested by the emperor Henry and taken to Germany. He was a prisoner in fortress Hamerstein on Ryn for six years until the emperor wanted to execute him. Finally st. Apollinaire, an apprentice of st. Peter and a martyr, appeared to Borivoj. He asked Borivoj: Do you want to return to Bohemia? And St. Apollinaire suddenly transferred Borivoj to his homeland near today's town Sladska which was a favourite residence of princes of Prague of Slavnikov's. That is why in 1118 the prince established church and a chapter. From that moment st. Apollinaire was honoured. This legend was published by Franti≈°ek Ruth with no specific sources from chronicles, which is why the origin of this legend is very disputable.  Surroundings  In close surroundings there is botanical garden of Faculty of Science Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Science Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, biological and geological section of Charles University, Institute of Pathology of the First Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital of St. Alzbeta Hospital. There are also two churches ‚Äì Church of Virgin Mary by Alzbetines with the chapel of St. Tekla and the church of Virgin Mary and St. Charles the Great situated in Karlov. The church also gave a name to nearby maternity hospital by Apollinaire. References * Ten centuries of architecture: Architecture of the gothic. 1. vyd.

Psychopaths are usually most common at higher levels of corporate organizations and their actions often cause a ripple effect throughout an organization, setting the tone for an entire corporate culture. Examples of detrimental effects are increased bullying, conflict, stress, staff turnover and absenteeism; reduction in productivity and in social responsibility.. Ethical standards of entire organisations can be badly damaged if a corporate psychopath is in charge.Boddy C, Ladyshewsky RK, Galvin PG Leaders without ethics in global business: corporate psychopaths Journal of Public Affairs Vol. 10 June 2010 pp. 121‚Äì38.

Hare further claims that the prevalence of psychopaths is higher in the business world than in the general population. Figures of around 3‚Äì4% have been cited for more senior positions in business.. A 2011 study of Australian white- collar managers found that 5.76 percent could be classed as psychopathic and another 10.42 percent dysfunctional with psychopathic characteristics.Saft J As psychopath CEOs destroy value, nice ones create it Reuters 21 Jun 2017 The organizational psychopath The organizational psychopath craves a god- like feeling of power and control over other people. They prefer to work at the very highest levels of their organizations, allowing them to control the greatest number of people. Psychopaths who are political leaders, managers, and CEOs fall into this category. Organizational psychopaths generally appear to be intelligent, sincere, powerful, charming, witty, and entertaining communicators. They quickly assess what people want to hear and then create stories that fit those expectations. They will con people into doing their work for them, take credit for other people's work and even assign their work to junior staff members. They have low patience when dealing with others, display shallow emotions, are unpredictable, undependable and fail to take responsibility if something goes wrong that is their fault. According to a study from the University of Notre Dame published in the Journal of Business Ethics, psychopaths have a natural advantage in workplaces overrun by abusive supervision, and are more likely to thrive under abusive bosses, being more resistant to stress, including interpersonal abuse, and having less of a need for positive relationships than others. Careers with highest proportion of psychopaths According to Dutton, the ten careers with the highest proportion of psychopaths are:Dutton K The Wisdom of Psychopaths: What Saints, Spies, and Serial Killers Can Teach Us About Success (2012) Behavioral patterns Suspected psychopath Robert Maxwell The workplace psychopath may show a high number of the following behavior patterns. The individual behaviors are not exclusive to the workplace psychopath, though the higher number of patterns exhibited, the more likely he or she conforms to the psychopath profile:Faggioni M & White M (2009) Organizational Psychopaths ‚Äì Who Are They and How to Protect Your Organization from Them * Public humiliation of others (high propensity of having temper tantrums or ridiculing work performance) * Malicious spreading of lies (intentionally deceitful) * Remorseless, devoid of guilt * Frequently lies to push his/her point * Produces exaggerated bodily expressions (yawning, sneezing, etc.) as a means of gaining attention * Rapidly shifts between emotions ‚Äì used to manipulate people or cause high anxiety * Intentionally isolates persons from organizational resources * Quick to blame others for mistakes or for incomplete work even though he/she is guilty * Encourages co-workers to torment, alienate, harass, and/or humiliate other peers * Takes credit for others' accomplishments * Steals and/or sabotages other persons' work * Refuses to take responsibility for misjudgements and/or errors * Responds inappropriately to stimuli, such as with a high-pitched and forced laugh * Threatens any perceived enemy with discipline and/or job loss in order to taint employee file * Sets unrealistic and unachievable job expectations to set employees up for failure * Refuses or is reluctant to attend meetings with more than one person * Refuses to provide adequate training and/or instructions to singled out victim * Invades personal privacy of others * Has multiple sexual encounters with other employees * Develops new ideas without real follow-through * Very self-centered and extremely egotistical (often conversation revolves around them ‚Äì great deal of self-importance) * Often \\"borrows\\" money and/or other material objects without any intentions of giving it back * Will do whatever it takes to close the deal (no regard for ethics or legality)  How a typical workplace psychopath climbs to and maintains power The authors of the book Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work describe a five-phase model of how a typical workplace psychopath climbs to and maintains power: # Entry ‚Äì psychopaths may use highly developed social skills and charm to obtain employment into an organisation. At this stage it will be difficult to spot anything which is indicative of psychopathic behaviour, and as a new employee one might perceive the psychopath to be helpful and even benevolent. # Assessment ‚Äì psychopaths will weigh one up according to one's usefulness, and one could be recognised as either a pawn (who has some informal influence and will be easily manipulated) or a patron (who has formal power and will be used by the psychopath to protect against attacks) # Manipulation ‚Äì psychopath will create a scenario of ‚Äúpsychopathic fiction‚Äù where positive information about themselves and negative disinformation about others will be created, where one's role as a part of a network of pawns or patrons will be utilised and will be groomed into accepting the psychopath's agenda. # Confrontation ‚Äì the psychopath will use techniques of character assassination to maintain their agenda, and one will be either discarded as a pawn or used as a patron # Ascension ‚Äì one's role as a patron in the psychopath's quest for power will be discarded, and the psychopath will take for himself/herself a position of power and prestige from anyone who once supported them. Why psychopaths are readily hired Leading commentators on psychopathy have said that companies inadvertently attract employees who are psychopaths because of the wording of their job advertisements and their desire to engage people who are prepared to do whatever it takes to be successful in business. However, in one case at least, an advert explicitly asked for a sales executive with psychopathic tendencies.Rodionova Z Company posts job advert for sales executive with psychopathic qualities The Independent 19 Oct 2016 The advert title read \\"Psychopathic New Business Media Sales Executive Superstar! ¬£50k - ¬£110k\\".McKenzie L Media firm seeks ‚Äòpsychopath‚Äô for sales role BT News 20 Oct 2016 Corporate psychopaths are readily recruited into organizations because they make a distinctly positive impression at interviews.Cleckley H The Mask of Sanity (1988) They appear to be alert, friendly and easy to get along with and talk to. They look like they are of good ability, emotionally well adjusted and reasonable, and these traits make them attractive to those in charge of hiring staff within organizations. Unlike narcissists, psychopaths are better able to create long-lasting favorable first impressions, though people may still eventually see through their facades. Psychopaths‚Äô undesirable personality traits may be easily misperceived by even skilled interviewers. For instance, their irresponsibility may be misconstrued by employers as risk-taking or entrepreneurial spirit. Their thrill-seeking tendencies may be conveyed as high energy and enthusiasm for the job or work. Their superficial charm may be misinterpreted by interviewers as charisma. It is worth noting that psychopaths are not only accomplished liars, they are also more likely to lie in interviews.Roulin, N., & Bourdage, J. S. (2017). Once an Impression Manager, Always an Impression Manager? Antecedents of Honest and Deceptive Impression Management Use and Variability across Multiple Job Interviews. Frontiers in Psychology, 8. For instance, psychopaths may create fictitious work experiences or resumes. They may also fabricate credentials such as diplomas, certifications, or awards. Thus, in addition to seeming competent and likable in interviews, psychopaths are also more likely to outright make-up information during interviews than non-psychopaths. Why psychopaths are readily promoted Corporate psychopaths within organizations may be singled out for rapid promotion because of their polish, charm, and cool decisiveness.Boddy, C. R The Corporate Psychopaths Theory of the Global Financial Crisis Journal of Business Ethics August 2011, Volume 102, Issue 2, pp 255‚Äì259, DOI 10.1007/s10551-011-0810-4 They are also helped by their manipulative and bullying skills. They create confusion around them (divide and rule etc.) using instrumental bullying to promote their own agenda.What Corporate Climbers Can Teach Us 'Dark' Personality Traits Can Help People Rise Through Ranks Wall Street Journal 14 Jul 2014 Psychopaths are able to maintain calm when others are reacting to normal stress and dangerous situations which makes them good fits for jobs such as the military, politics, and finances. Psychopaths are well versed in impression management and ingratiation, both skills that can be used to impress people in positions of power. Bad consequences Boddy identifies the following bad consequences of workplace psychopathy (with additional cites in some cases): * Workplace bullying of employeesHarvey, M. G., Buckley, M.

(2006). The social stressors-counterproductive work behaviors link: Are conflicts with supervisors and coworkers the same? Journal of Occupational Health Psychology 11, 145‚Äì156. =Counterproductive work behavior= Boddy suggests that because of abusive supervision by corporate psychopaths, large amounts of anti-company feeling will be generated among the employees of the organisations that corporate psychopaths work in. This should result in high levels of counterproductive behaviour as employees give vent to their anger with the corporation, which they perceive to be acting through its corporate psychopathic managers in a way that is eminently unfair to them. According to a 2017 UK study, a high ranking corporate psychopath could trigger lower ranked staff to become workplace bullies as a manifestation of counterproductive work behavior.Glowatz E Bad Jobs: If Your Boss Is A Psychopath, You Might Act Like One Too Medical Daily 6 Jan 2017 Corporate psychopath theory of the global financial crisis Boddy makes the case that corporate psychopaths were instrumental in causing the 2007‚Äì08 global financial crisis. He claims that the same corporate psychopaths who probably caused the crisis by greed and avarice are now advising government on how to get out of the crisis. Psychologist Oliver James has described the credit crunch as a ‚Äúmass outbreak of corporate psychopathy which resulted in something that very nearly crashed the whole world economy.‚ÄùPsychopath Night Channel 4 (2013). For example, during this financial crisis, the behaviour of some key people at the top of the world's largest banks came under scrutiny. At the time of its collapse in 2008 the Royal Bank of Scotland was the world's fifth largest bank by market capitalisation. CEO Fred \\"the Shred\\" Goodwin was known for taking excessive risks and showing little concern for his mismanagement, which led to the bank's collapse. Goodwin's demeanour toward colleagues was unpredictable and he is said to have lived a luxury lifestyle while fostering a culture of fear.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/fiddling-while-rbs- burned-new-book-reveals-fred-the-shred-goodwin-s-fatal-obsessions-8795202.html Renowned psychotherapist Professor Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries singled out Goodwin and former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond as exhibiting psychopathic behaviours in his working paper on the SOB, \\"seductive operational bully - or psychopath lite\\" Screening From an organizational perspective, organizations can insulate themselves from the organizational psychopath by taking the following steps when recruiting: * conduct behavioral type interview * verify information contained in the curriculum vitae * conduct reference checks * obtain work samples * carry out criminal reference checks The following tests could be used to screen psychopaths: * Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (PCL: SV)de Silva, P (2014) Tackling psychopathy: a necessary competency in leadership development?

Psychological Assessment Vol 25(1), Mar 2013, 288‚Äì293. There have been anecdotal reports that at least one UK bank was using a psychopathy measure to actively recruit psychopaths.Corporate Psychopaths, Transcript of Interview with Clive Boddy, Author, part 1 July 28, 2013Basham B Beware corporate psychopaths ‚Äì they are still occupying positions of power The Independent 29 Dec 2011 Research findings based on the PM-MRV may have little relevance to medical psychopathy. Workplace bullying overlap Narcissism, lack of self-regulation, lack of remorse, and lack of conscience have been identified as traits displayed by bullies. These traits are shared with psychopaths, indicating that there is some theoretical cross-over between bullies and psychopaths. Bullying is used by corporate psychopaths as a tactic to humiliate subordinates. Bullying is also used as a tactic to scare, confuse and disorient those who may be a threat to the activities of the corporate psychopath. Using meta data analysis on hundreds of UK research papers, Boddy concluded that 36% of bullying incidents were caused by the presence of corporate psychopaths. According to Boddy, there are two types of bullying: * Predatory bullying ‚Äì the bully just enjoys bullying and tormenting vulnerable people for the sake of it * Instrumental bullying ‚Äì the bullying is for a purpose, helping the bully achieve his or her goals. A corporate psychopath uses instrumental bullying to further his goals of promotion and power as the result of causing confusion and divide and rule. People with high scores on a psychopathy rating scale are more likely to engage in bullying, crime, and drug use than other people.Nathanson, C.; Williams, K. M.; Paulhus, D. L. 2006, \\"Predictors of a Behavioral Measure of Scholastic Cheating: Personality and Competence but Not Demographics\\", Contemporary Educational Psychology vol. 31, pp. 97‚Äì122. Hare and Babiak noted that about 29 per cent of corporate psychopaths are also bullies. Other research has also shown that people with high scores on a psychopathy rating scale were more likely to engage in bullying, again indicating that psychopaths tend to be bullies in the workplace. A workplace bully or abuser will often have issues with social functioning. These types of people often have psychopathic traits that are difficult to identify in the hiring and promotion process. These individuals often lack anger management skills and have a distorted sense of reality. Consequently, when confronted with the accusation of abuse, the abuser is not aware that any harm was done.Ferris, P.A. (2009).

Specification  The cells of the species of Sporosarcina are either rod-shaped or coccoid. Sporosarcina forms endospores. The majority species of Sporosarcina is moveable (motile).  Metabolism  All species of Sporosarcina are heterotrophic. They do not perform photosynthesis. A few species are obligate aerobic, they need oxygen. Others are facultative aerobic, they can also perform metabolism in the absence of oxygen.  Ecology  Some species, such as S. ureae have the enzyme urease and are thus able to break down urea. The species forms the highest population densities in soils that are subject to influence of urine. These include, for example, meadows where cattle are kept. Thus S. ureae plays an important role in the ecosystem.  Systematics  Sporosarcina belongs to the firmicutes.J.P.

History and architecture The first references to Krengerup are from 1514 but the estate seems to be older. Since 1770, it has belonged to the Rantzau family. It was the principal property on a large estate which included S√∏holm and Brahesholm. In 1590, Gabriel Knudsen Akeleye built a thatched half-timbered house on the site of today's mansion. The property exchanged hands several times until Count Christian Rantzau purchased it in 1770. The farm buildings and the large separately standing manor were built by his son Frederik Siegfred from 1772 to 1783. The Neoclassical manor is thought to have been designed by Hans N√¶ss (1723-1795). In 1783, the manor's name was changed to Frederikslund. In 1917, the buildings were fully restored by Jens Christian Rantzau with the assistance of architect Jens Ingwersen. He also reinstated the name of Krengerup. Krengerup today Kregerup still functions mainly as an agricultural enterprise but, in addition, it houses two museums: the Flax Weaving Museum, run by a group of volunteers, and the ≈†koda Museum, the only one of its kind outside the Czech Republic, which has been housed at Krengerup since 2001. The grounds are open to the public throughout the year. References External links *Krengerup Gods website in Danish.

The KRPP will be a key asset in strategic terms, as it will cover almost half the power demand in the country, and will be the long-term source of thermal energy for municipal heating in the surrounding municipalities. In 2015, the Government of Kosovo awarded ContourGlobal (CG) the status of the preferred provider for the development of the KRPP. The Government of Kosovo and ContourGlobal signed the Commercial Agreements for the construction of the Kosova e Re Power Plant in December 2017. CG is a US-based company specializing in securing and developing long-term energy production for different types of electricity generation and geographic locations. The KRPP will be built in line with the EU Directive on Environmental Standards for Industrial Emissions and 2017 BATs, with a minimum of 40% efficiency with super-critical technology. The KRPP will be built with full financing from private investments. However, according to the signed Agreements, this power plant will be transferred to the Government of Kosovo after 20 years, at no cost. The KRPP will simultaneously address the solution of a range of energy sector issues, but also wider issues for the country, such as the security of power supply, the direct impact on sustainability and economic development, as well as the significant improvement of social and environmental aspects. In 2020, ContourGlobal withdrew from the project and it appears likely that the new power station will not now be built. History Plans to address Kosovo's energy situation began in the early 2000s and originally envisioned a 2,000-MW lignite plant that would allow the country to export energy to its neighbours. The government presented the plan in July 2009 and it suggested that all work would be finished by 2015 or at least by 2017.Government decides to build the new Kosovo power plant.

Financing To attract investors whom are concerned about political or credit risks, the World Bank offered US$60 million in loan guarantees that would set in if the government failed to meet obligations such as supplying coal or electricity. This means that the World Bank, as well as the biggest shareholder - the United States of America, will need to make an exception in their clean-energy commitments.

Kjorton Bjornson from the European Commission in July 2009 expressed support for the construction of the new power plant with the view to shut down Kosovo A plant.

Opposition Certain groups and organisations are of the view that the new power plant would mean the continuation of traditional coal-based electricity production. Today Kosovo wastes 30% of available energy due to energy efficiency, 37% due to technical losses, the outdated electrical grid and other commercial losses, such as theft. A study by Dr. Daniel Kammen shows that \\"Kosovo can cover 38% of its energy consumption from renewable sources\\". He also specified that this scenario, without including the Kosova e Re power plant, would create 27% more jobs than current scenarios.An Independent Study Challenges Energy Policy in Kosovo. The Institute for Development Policy. Published 02/02/2012. Retrieved 13/07/2014. Energy Community commitments cite that Kosovo needs to source 25% of overall energy from renewable sources by 2020, which will be harder to achieve if the new power plant is to be constructed. The Kosovo Civil Society Consortium for Sustainable Development (KOSID) are questioning the necessity of the costly power plant and instead propose energy efficiency programmes, which tackle of energy losses, renewable energy development and the rehabilitation of the existing Kosovo B Power Station. They also raise the issue of the environmental and social impacts the new project would have on Kosovars. There are 835 deaths per year in Kosovo due to air pollution, of which the lignite power plants are responsible for a substantial proportion. A new power station could make matters worse. KOSID also stressed the issue of water and agricultural land shortage and the resettlement of the local population which consists mostly of farmers who will need compensation for the lost land and livelihoodsKosova e Re lignite power plant, Kosovo Kosovo Civil Society Consortium for Sustainable Development.

Attwood hired Tony Basgallop to complete the work, crediting him with bringing his own voice to the project. Attwood dedicated the films to Jackson. Attwood had been interested in developing a film adaptation since reading the first novel of the trilogy, Rites of Passage. The production crew built two ships to film. The company filmed in South Africa at Richards Bay, as they wanted to convey the feel of the tropics. They encountered heavy weather at this location. Whilst filming in South Africa Benedict, with friends \\" Theo and Denise\\" went for a weekend driving course around Sodwana Bay. On the return they broke down and were carjacked.

He is mainly known for his efforts in promoting the Egyptian customs to the early Achaemenid kings of the 27th Dynasty. We know about his remarkable and controversial career thanks to his autobiography, inscribed on a well known statue depicting him; the statue, commonly called Naoforo vaticano (Italian for \\"Vatican naos-carrier\\") was originally placed in the temple of Neith at Sais likely in Year 3 of Darius I (c. 519 BCE) and is now exhibited inside the Vatican Museums (more precisely in the Museo Gregoriano Egizio) of Rome. Biography Early in his career, during the reigns of pharaohs Amasis II and Psamtik III, Udjahorresnet was a commander of ships (admiral), a physician and a priest of Neith in Sais. p. 212. After the defeat at Pelusium in 525 BCE and the subsequent conquest of Egypt by Cambyses II, he eventually was relieved from his military duties. Nevertheless, his influence grew unexpectedly under the reign of the foreign kings, Cambyses and his successor Darius I: Udjahorresnet apparently became a sort of collaborationist for the Persians, managing to enter in the royal court as chancellor and chief physician. From his statue, it is known that he used his influence to make Cambyses acknowledge and respect Egyptian customs. Acculturated by Udjahorresnet, the pharaoh paid homage to the goddess Neith at Sais, not before having driven out many Persian squatters who had settled within the temple; Udjahorresnet himself composed Cambyses' pharaonic titulary, calling him the Horus Smatawy (‚ÄùHe who unifies the Two Lands‚Äù) and the King of Upper and Lower Egypt Mesutire (‚ÄúOffspring of Ra‚Äù). This view of Udjahorresnet (and other Achaemenid Egypt's high officials) being \\"collaborators\\" and the interpretation of his inscription are recently challenged by H. P. Colburn as a misconception resulted by earlier scholars' preconceived notion of the Achaemenid rule in Egypt being insidious. In fact, archaeological evidences suggest Udjahorresnet was venerated after his death for some time by at least a part of the Egyptian populace. After Cambyses' death (522 BCE), Udjahorresnet's mission continued with Darius I: in fact, he even escorted Darius on his return to Susa and before returning to Egypt, he persuaded the new pharaoh to entrust to him the restoration of Per-ankh (the ‚ÄúHouse of Life‚Äù), a well known educational and cultural institution in ancient Egypt. p. 419. Udjahorresnet probably died later during Darius' reign. His huge shaft tomb at Abusir was excavated between 1980 and 1993, and found looted in antiquity. It is still a matter of debate if Udjahorresnet was indeed buried here or not; if not, it is possible that he died and was entombed in Persia rather than Egypt. p. 105 References Further reading * External links *The inscription of Udjahorresne Category:People of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt Category:Ancient Egyptian physicians Category:Ancient Egyptian treasurers Category:Ancient Egyptian priests Category:Court physicians Category:Admirals Category:6th-century BC births Category:Year of death missing Category:6th-century BC clergy Category:6th century BC in Egypt Category:Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt ","title":"Udjahorresnet"},{"id":"43068390","text":"The Star City Roller Girls is a roller derby league based in Roanoke, Virginia.

Blyth joined the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1941 and served with them until the end of the Second World War. During the war Blyth continued to paint and sketch, whilst on active service in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Four paintings from this period were acquired by the War Artists' Advisory Committee. Towards the end of the conflict Blyth's unit, 157 Ambulance, was based in Hamburg much of which had been devastated by RAF bombing raids in 1943. Blyth used the background of a destroyed city in his most famous painting, In the Image of Man. Painted after the war ended the painting's title parodies the Judeo- Christian concept of man made in the image of God and shows a city in ruins behind a bomb damaged crucifix. In 1945 Blyth won the Guthrie Award from the Royal Scottish Academy. In 1946 he painted Existence Precarious, a self- portrait as a soldier in a trench, which is now in the National Gallery of Scotland. Also in 1946 he began teaching at the Edinburgh School of Art and became an artist in residence at Hospitalfield House. In 1954 he moved to Aberdeen to take a post at Gray's School of Art, where he became head of drawing in 1960, a post he maintained until his death in 1970.

On June 12, 2014, British actor Tom Hiddleston who was set to play Hank Williams, posted an image of himself on his Twitter account, dressed as Williams with the title of the film as the caption. Hiddleston will sing his own music for the film, also taking on Williams' southern accent. To prepare for the film and work on his singing and guitar playing, Hiddleston practiced with country singer Rodney Crowell. In July 2014, Crowell signed on to be the executive music producer for the film while Carter Little, who has worked with the Black Keys on The Man With the Iron Fists, signed on to serve as music supervisor. Crowell said of Hiddleston, \\"After nearly a month spent collaborating with this gifted artist, I'm as respectful of the man's work ethic as I'm mystified by his transformational skills. Without a doubt, the filmmakers chose the right actor for the job.\\" At the 2014 Wheatland Music Festival, Hiddleston sang \\"Move It on Over\\" and \\"Jambalaya (On the Bayou)\\", promoting the film.

He laid down his life in the freedom struggle of the country. He was killed in an encounter with the British police officer DSP R. Hall while he was underground with his team in the jungle of Sidhagadh on 2 January 1943.  Early life  Vithal Kotwal was born on 1 December 1912 in Matheran, a hill station near Mumbai, in the district Raigad. He belonged to the poor barber family. He stayed there till the fourth grade when he studied in the local school and returned only after he graduated from Pune in 1936. He was the eldest and had three sisters.  Education  After studying till fourth grade in the local school, he shifted to Pune to her aunt Gaurutai Halde, where he stayed till he completed his graduation from Wadia college. He stood first in the entire Pune district in his Vernacular Metric exam. After he returned to his native place, he studied law in Mumbai and became advocate in 1941.  Family  Vithal Kotwal was married to Indu Tirlapurkar from Pune in 1935. He had a boy named Bharat who died at the age of 22. His daughter Jagruti died within two months when Mr. Kotwal was underground in 1942. His wife Indu Kotwal died in 2012 at the age of 91.  Social Work  As soon as Vithal Kotwal returned to Matheran he got into socio political activities defying his father‚Äôs wish to carry on their family tradition. He began helping people when cyclone hit entire western Mumbai shore and fisherman community got displaced. Later in coordination with the local congress leader Rajaram alias Bhausaheb Raut, he got involved in politics and social work. He helped creating and enrolling common people in the voters‚Äô list in the Matheran area. When he came across to see that landlords cheat peasants due to their ignorance he stated voluntary school for the children of these farmers. He altogether started 42 such schools in the area. Later, when landlords denied food grain to the farmers at the time of drought, Vithal Kotwal came up with the innovative idea of grain bank for the farmers. With the financial support of Mr. Raut, a few thousand kilos of grain were imported and distributed amongst the farmers. Whoever took a grain loan had to replace it with twenty-five percent extra; whereas the landlords used to charge them double the loan. Later when he became an advocate he served the poor peasants and downtrodden to fight for their right against the landlords who exploited them. In 1940 he organized a peasants and workers congregation in Karjat where prominent political activists of the time Achyutrao Patwardhan, S. M. Joshi, Lalji Pendse attended.  Political career  Vithal Kotwal successfully fought the election for Matheran city council and became vice chairman in 1941.  Freedom struggle  Though motivated for the freedom struggle from his college days in Pune, Vithal became influenced by socio communist movement in the country. Hence he was called \\"Bhai\\" as an Indian synonym for comrade. He got fully involved and went underground when Mahatma Gandhi on 9 August 1942 asked British to \\"quit India\\". After the arrest of all the major leaders in India, an arrest warrant was also issued in the name of Bhai Kotwal. He went underground the same day, vowing to either \\"live in my free country or in the heaven\\". He was vice chairman of Matheran then.  Kotwal Dasta  While underground he formed group of underground mercenaries called \\"Kotwal Dasta\\", a parallel government in the Karjat taluka of Raigad district. They were about 50 in numbers including farmers and voluntary school teachers and his cousin brothers Pentanna and Dattoba Halde. They decided to cut down the electric pylons supplying electricity to Mumbai city. From September 1942 through November 1942 they felled 11 pylons, paralyzing the industries and railways. To counter the menace police announced cash award of rupees 2500 leading to the arrest of Bhai Kotwal. Also a special officer DSP R. Hall and Officer Stafford were called to counter Bhai Kotwal. When the Krantikari Kotwal Dasta was hiding in the remote jungle of Sidhgadh in Murbad Taluka, he sent a letter for help which fell into the hands of one of the landlords of the area, who turned the letter and the messenger over to Officer Hall. Krantikari says its indian soldier  Final encounter  On 2 January 1943 early morning when the Azad Dasta was preparing to shift to another safe place and was waiting for the help to come, R. Hall and Stafford attacked the Dasta members. First to fall was the young Hiraji Patil, son of deputy leader of Azad Dasta Gomaji Patil. Hiraji died on the spot. Bhai Kotwal got injured in the thigh and could not move. Hall killed him point blank. He was one of the many lesser known freedom fighters who laid down their lives for the freedom of the country. For his brave fight and sacrifice he is now proudly called \\"Veer Bhai Kotwal\\", meaning warrior.

History Chartered on June 24, 1848, the Concord and Claremont Railroad was established and construction had begun on November 19, 1848. Approximately ten months later on September 21, the railroad was opened from Concord to Warner. The very first train to travel the line left Warner and had approximately 500 passengers aboard the 9 passenger coaches. On the return trip from Concord, the train carried about 800 passengers on the 18 passenger coaches which required a second locomotive pushing from the rear. The original railroad line was only long, but it was soon extended through Bradford, adding to the line. In 1852, the railroad filed for bankruptcy; it was merged in 1853 with the New Hampshire Central Railroad forming what was known as the Merrimac and Connecticut Rivers Railroad Company. In 1874, the Sugar River Railroad, which built and ran their rail line from Newport to Claremont, merged with the Contoocook Valley Railroad and again created the Concord and Claremont Railroad, under the control of the Northern Railroad. In 1887, the Boston and Maine Railroad absorbed the Concord and Claremont, and the line was now known as the Claremont branch of the Boston & Maine.  Independent shortline  The Claremont and Concord Railroad was established in 1954 when shortline railroad operator Samuel Pinsly purchased of track between Claremont Junction and Concord from the Boston and Maine Railroad. A succession of abandonments between 1961 and 1977 cut the line back to just between Claremont and Claremont Junction. In 1988, the line was sold to a local lumber dealer that renamed the operation Claremont-Concord Railroad. In 2015 the railroad was acquired by Genesee and Wyoming Industries and integrated into its New England Central Railroad. Abandonments Difficult economic times and the advancement of the automobile forced many railroads to close rail lines. The Boston & Maine Railroad was to sell off the rights to many of the lines and rights of way it held, freeing up the Claremont branch as an independent in 1954, this time as the Claremont and Concord Railroad. Once this had taken place, the Claremont and Concord's abandonments took place from east to west: *1960: 9 miles, W. Concord - west to Contoocook *1961: 17.6 miles, Contoocook - west to Bradford *1964: 16+ miles, Bradford - northwest to Newport *1977: 11 miles, Newport - west to Claremont *1988: 1.5 miles within Claremont *1988: 3 mile section - Electric Claremont Railway (opened in 1903) Present uses The Claremont Concord Railroad now operates between Claremont Junction on the main line to Claremont as a subsidiary of New England Central Railroad, itself a subsidiary of Genesee & Wyoming Industries. of the line between Claremont and Newport is now the Sugar River Recreational Rail Trail, owned and managed by the New Hampshire Division of Parks and Recreation.

It was founded as an illustrated literary review, with topics of interest to women. It included articles on poetry, theater and fashion, as well as portraits and biographies of heroes of the recent war of independence. The editors held radical political opinions. El Iris published the first political cartoon in Mexico, named \\"Tyranny\\". Due to the political controversy stirred up by articles in the journal it was forced to close after printing forty issues. Foundation The journal was established by Italian artists Claudio Linati and Florencio Galli, and the Cuban poet Jos√© Mar√≠a Heredia y Heredia. The two Italians had been involved in the unsuccessful struggle for Italian unity in 1820-21, and then had moved to Catalonia. Galli moved to Mexico after the Spanish liberal regime had fallen. He had arrived by January 1825, and worked for a while in the silver mines of Tlalpujahua. Linati moved first to France and then to Belgium, where he had received permission to move to Mexico, planning to start a lithography shop. He arrived in September 1825. Heridia was from Santiago de Cuba. He had been involved in the Matanzas conspiracy for Cuban independence and had taken refuge in the United States. He reached Mexico in August 1825, invited by President Guadalupe Victoria. Linati expected to \\"civilize\\" and politicize the newly liberated Mexican people. He established his printing shop at Calle de San Agust√≠n # 15 in Mexico City in January 1826 with two presses, one for typeface and one for lithographs. An advertisement for the new journal appeared in the Mexican newspaper El √Åguila on 13 January 1826, saying it would offer a pleasant distraction to all interested in letters, particularly the fair sex. The first issue appeared on 4 February 1826, in a format. The magazine was published weekly at first, and then twice a week. Content Woman in French Republican Fashion - El Iris #1 The magazine included articles on poetry, the theater, Mexican customs, biographies and court cases. Lithographs depicted antiquities and modern fashions. It also provided portraits of Guadalupe Victoria, Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos and Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, heroes of the independence struggle. The first issue included an illustration called \\"The Figurine\\" by Claudio Linati showing a woman dressed in the style of the French Republic, said to be the first colored lithograph made in Mexico. In the accompanying article Linati proposed that Mexican women should adopt the simple Republican garments, which would allow them to move freely, rather than the traditional Spanish dress and mantilla. Issue 34 contained a lithograph of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla by Linati's assistant Jos√© Gracida, the first lithograph by a Mexican to be published. El Iris also included editorial content that sparked controversy. Linati was sure there would be another attempt by Spain to conquer Mexico. He and Galli became involved in the disputes between Yorkinos and Escoceses, rival groups of Freemasons. Linati took the Yorkino position that the people were sovereign, and only federalism could protect individuals and the nation against the depredations of the army and the priests. He was opposed to strong central authority and in favor of greater education in citizenship and the discipline of military service. The paper published the first Mexican political cartoon, La Tiran√≠a (Tyranny), which was attributed to Linati. This is thought to be the first political cartoon published in Mexico. El Iris demanded freedom of the press throughout Mexico. File:El Iris La Tiran√≠a 1826.jpgCartoon Tiran√≠a as it appeared in El Iris File:Tiran√≠a circa 1820.jpgOriginal for the cartoon Closure Heredia resigned as editor on 21 June 1826, apparently due to ideological disagreements with the two Italians. He later obtained positions within the Mexican administration which indicated that he had good contacts in the government. After forty issues, the last appeared on 2 August 1826. The political comments caused the closure of the paper and forced Linati to leave the country in 1826. Although short- lived, El Iris established a lasting model for journals that printed satirical lithographs on political and social subjects.

The Ida Lange building (1642) is a half-timbered Renaissance residence while the De Linde building (1770) is Baroque with fine period staircases. The Tang building (1839) is Neoclassical in design. Inspired by Dutch architecture, the free standing gate tower from 1790 was added by the estate's owner at the time, Peder Tang. Surroundings The estate which covers 533 acres offers birdlife along the coasts of the North Sea and Nissum Fjord. The forested area also contains a moraine landscape around Skovbjerg Bakkes√∏ to the southeast.

Outline Slowly but surely, over the last two to three thousand years, Chinese expatriates have gained a firm trade and business foothold in almost every country around the Pacific Rim area, from Vietnam and Indochina to the West Coast of the United States and Canada. Seagrave attempts to disclose the way these Chinese merchants do business, with each other and with others. He claims that many of these entrepreneurs, despite how many years or centuries they may have been settled in a particular country hold no real allegiance to any government or people except their ancestral clans and ‚Äòhome‚Äô villages in China. The author also reveals some of the dubious and aggressive business practices these Lords of the Rim have adopted and mastered over the years. These tactics and their traditional work ethos go some way to explain their astonishing success in the past and up to the present day.https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sterling-seagrave/lords-of-the- rim/http://nekosnews.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/sterling-seagrave-lords-of- rim.html References Category:1995 non-fiction books Category:Books about economic history Category:Books about China ","title":"Lords of the Rim"},{"id":"43068691","text":"Prain Global Inc.

The broad, rather solid shell has a conical shape. The spire is conic. The apex is generally eroded, corneous (orange colored). There are about 7 whorls, which are slightly convex. The shells are whitish, painted with oblique flexuose (angular brownish-green) radiating stripes. Nearly the whole surface can be suffused with bright green by the erosion of the outer layer. The sculpture consists of inconspicuous incremental striae and very oblique subobsolete folds. The flat base of the shell is very obsoletely lirate. Its middle portion (umbilical tract) is excavated, concave, strongly spirally grooved. The sculpture does not extend into the aperture nor to the edge of the columella, which is nacreous. The large aperture is very oblique, very iridescent and neither lirate nor toothed within. The basal lips and columella are simple, forming a regular curve. The columella shows a strong dentiform fold above. The green parietal wall is eroded and, nearly smooth. Distribution This marine species occurs off South Africa.

Origins The phrase ‚ÄúEurope whole and free‚Äù was first used prominently by U.S. President George H. W. Bush in a speech on May 31, 1989, in Mainz, West Germany. Addressing an auditorium full of German citizens and political leaders, including Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Bush laid out his vision for the Europe that should emerge from the end of the Cold War and the waning of Communist and Soviet influence in Europe‚Äôs east. He said: :‚Äú‚Ä¶our responsibility is to look ahead and grasp the promise of the future. I said recently that we're at the end of one era and at the beginning of another. And I noted that in regard to the Soviet Union, our policy is to move beyond containment. For 40 years, the seeds of democracy in Eastern Europe lay dormant, buried under the frozen tundra of the Cold War. And for 40 years, the world has waited for the Cold War to end. And decade after decade, time after time, the flowering human spirit withered from the chill of conflict and oppression; and again, the world waited. But the passion for freedom cannot be denied forever. The world has waited long enough. The time is right.

Post-Cold War evolution Less than seven months after Bush‚Äôs speech, popular protests had forced out the communist governments of Eastern Europe, and Bush and Gorbachev had held a summit meeting in Malta (on 2‚Äì3 December) that some observers regarded as marking the end of the Cold War. In the decades following the Cold War‚Äôs end and the collapse (in 1991) of the Soviet Union, European nations and the United States pursued efforts to end Europe‚Äôs Cold War divisions. As former communist East European countries held free elections and chose non-communist governments, the United States and Western European nations agreed to include them within the continent‚Äôs main international institutions ‚Äì the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ‚Äì to include former Soviet and Soviet-bloc states. By 2009, NATO had admitted 12 members from formerly communist-ruled Eastern Europe: the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland in 1999; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004; and Albania and Croatia in 2009. The European Union added 11 such members: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia and Hungary in 2004; Bulgaria and Romania in 2007; and Croatia in 2013.

Since this was Apache land, the petitioners agreed to provide their own firearms, as well as their own ammunition and establish bastions and towers. Chac√≥n accepted the request and, on November 25, 1794, granted land to the petitioners. He also ordered the Mayor of Santa Fe, Antonio Jose Ortiz, to deliver legal possession of the lands to people who wanted to have them, based on the conditions and the requirements needed in such cases.New Mexico Office of the State Historian: San Miguel del Vado Grant.

Moreover, after 1796, Chac√≥n granted portions of land to 63 families in Taos, New Mexico, in the village of Pueblo Native Americans, an allied ethnicity to Spaniards, although this could have been done without the consent of the Native Americans (at least there is no evidence to indicate otherwise).Clark, Ira G (1987).

Most centred on officiating, with referees coming under criticism for their performances. Furthermore, there were various issues with safety, including eight deaths of workers and a fire during construction, breaches into stadiums, an unstable makeshift staircase at the Maracan√£ Stadium, a monorail collapse, and the collapse of an unfinished overpass in Belo Horizonte. The most notable disciplinary case was that of Uruguayan striker Luis Su√°rez, who was disciplined after biting an Italian player, defender Giorgio Chiellini, during a game. Before the tournament =Protests= Anti-World Cup demonstration on the opening day. Prior to the opening ceremony of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup staged in Brazil, demonstrations took place outside the venue, organised by people unhappy with the amount of public money spent to enable the hosting of the FIFA World Cup. Both President of Brazil Dilma Rousseff and FIFA President Sepp Blatter were heavily booed as they were announced to give their speeches at the 2013 tournament's opening, which resulted in FIFA announcing that the 2014 World Cup opening ceremony would not feature any speeches. Further protests took place outside other matches during the Confederations Cup as part of wider unrest and rioting in Brazilian cities, seeking to express disenchantment with the government's financial management of the country. The weeks preceding the 2014 World Cup, as well as the first days of the tournament, featured further unrest and protests across the country against the spending. Unlike at the Confederations Cup, however, security forces managed to prevent any protests from reaching the stadiums. While covering a protest for CNN during the 12 June opening game, reporter Shasta Darlington and producer Barbara Arvanitidis were injured. Arvanitidis was directly hit on the wrist by a tear-gas bomb while they were reporting the indiscriminate use of riot weapons. Blatter said that the protesters \\"should not use football to make their demands heard\\", and that the public expenditure on staging the tournaments was on \\"items that are for the future, not just for the World Cup\\". President Rousseff responded with a public address in which she stated, \\"The federal money spent on the stadiums is in the form of financing that will be duly repaid by the companies and governments that are exploiting these stadiums.\\"https://www.standard.co.uk/pasportsfeeds/fifa-has- faith-in-brazil-8669573.html#gsc.tab=0 A mural by street artist Paulo Ito became a global viral phenomenon in the month before the World Cup. The spray paint and latex work depicted a black child sobbing at a dinner table, with nothing on his plate but a football. Ito intended the mural to focus on the FIFA issue, but worldwide it was often interpreted as a general attack on President Rousseff and the Workers' Party, an idea that Ito called simply \\"stupid\\". Former Brazilian footballer and now political figure Rom√°rio labelled the tournament \\"the biggest theft in history\\", saying that he believed its real cost would exceed R$100 billion (¬£26 billion/‚Ç¨32 billion/US$45 billion). He called for a deeper investigation into the widespread misuse of public funds, which he identified as the reason for the continuing protests. Nevertheless, he was criticised by the ruling Workers' Party for receiving R$1 million to appear in two TV advertisements which promoted the World Cup. Directly before the tournament, President Rousseff reiterated her assurances of the previous year that all the implemented public works had long-term benefits for Brazilians. =Budweiser bill= After numerous deaths in football stadiums, Brazil passed a law in 2003 outlawing alcohol sales in stadiums. FIFA demanded that Brazil allow alcohol sales at the World Cup because Budweiser, a major World Cup sponsor, was the \\"Official Beer of the FIFA World Cup\\", a role it had played since 1986. In response, Brazil passed a law paving the way for alcohol sales in the World Cup, nicknamed the \\"Budweiser Bill\\".Brazil Moves To Ease Soccer Beer Ban, As World Cup Spat With FIFA Grows, NPR (7 March 2012).Brazilian Senate approves ‚ÄòBudweiser bill‚Äô ending dispute with FIFA over World Cup sponsoring, Merco Press, (10 May 2012). =Seeding of France= There was some controversy before the draw when FIFA decided upon their allocation of the draw pots. Only eight sides were seeded for the World Cup draw: the hosts plus the seven sides ranked highest in the October 2013 FIFA World Rankings. The remaining 24 unseeded sides were allocated to three pots based on their geographical locations. However, there were still nine unseeded European sides, which meant that one European side had to be allocated to Pot 2, which otherwise consisted of African and South American sides. A similar situation arose with the 2006 World Cup seeding, and on that occasion the lowest ranked European side at the time of the draw, Serbia and Montenegro, were placed in the alternative pot. For the 2014 draw, FIFA decided that the European team in Pot 2 would be drawn there randomly. France would have been the lowest ranked side, and many thought, based on the 2006 precedent, that the rule change benefitted them. Many officials, fans, and journalists complained, pointing out that a Frenchman, FIFA secretary general J√©r√¥me Valcke, suggested the change, and suspecting that another influential Frenchman, UEFA president Michel Platini, helped approve it. Instead, Italy were drawn into Pot 2 and ended up in a difficult group. The next day, a headline in the Italian sports periodical Corriere Dello Sport read, \\"2014 World Cup draw: What a scandal!\\". Group stage =Brazil vs Croatia= The Japanese referee Yuichi Nishimura faced heavy criticism for his performance in the Group A opening match between Croatia and the host team Brazil as several decisions favoured the host nation. In the 71st minute, the Croatian defender Dejan Lovren put his hands below the Brazilian striker Fred's arms in the Croatian penalty area, after which Fred fell down. Nishimura awarded Brazil a penalty kick which Neymar converted for their second goal in a 3‚Äì1 win. The call was condemned by various sources, including former top-level FIFA referees, newspaper writers, players from other teams and fans in Nishimura's home country, saying that Lovren's contact was minimal and that Fred went down on his own. Twelve minutes later, the Croatians had an equaliser controversially disallowed for a supposed foul by Croatian forward Ivica Oliƒá on the Brazilian goalkeeper J√∫lio C√©sar. Earlier in the game, in the 26th minute, Neymar elbowed the Croatian midfielder Luka Modriƒá, after which Neymar was shown a yellow card. At that time Croatia were leading the game 1‚Äì0. Many critics agreed that Neymar's punishment was too lenient and that Neymar should have been shown a red card. Also, with the game at 1‚Äì1, Oliƒá was running with the ball in a fast Croatian counterattack. Dani Alves tripped him with his knee against the heel but, despite it not being intentional, Oliƒá was one-on-one with the goalkeeper, with Alves arguably deserving a red card for it for being the last man. Nevertheless, the Japanese referee did not show Alves any card and did not give Croatia a free-kick. Near the end of the match, Ramires went into a heavy tackle against Ivan Rakitiƒá in the centre of the field, which made the Croatian fall and lose the ball. No foul was called, and the ball was taken by Oscar who ran with it and scored Brazil's third goal. The renowned former top- level FIFA referee Markus Merk questioned FIFA's appointment of Nishimura in the opening match, labelling the refereeing as \\"embarrassing\\". Massimo Busacca, the head of refereeing development at FIFA, defended Nishimura's penalty kick decision and insisted that Dejan Lovren's contact was significant enough. =Mexico vs Cameroon: Giovani's two disallowed goals= In the Group A game between Mexico and Cameroon, Mexican midfielder Giovani dos Santos had two goals wrongly disallowed for offside in the first half. Replays showed that he was in line with the second to last defender for the first, while the ball came from a deliberate play by a Cameroonian player for the second. Following the game, which Mexico won 1‚Äì0, Amy Lawrence of The Guardian described the tournament as having \\"incompetent officiating\\", and called for FIFA president Sepp Blatter to allow team managers to challenge two decisions per match with video review, a possibility that Blatter discussed before the tournament. On 20 June 2014, FIFA announced that they had removed the Colombian assistant referee responsible for the incidents, Humberto Clavijo, from further officiating at the tournament. =Mexico vs Brazil= Both Brazilian and Mexican fans abused each other by anti-gay chants during the match. =Spain vs Netherlands: Behaviour of Diego Costa= Much attention ahead of the tournament had focused on the switch of Brazilian-born striker Diego Costa to Spain. Costa returned to his native land for his World Cup debut, only for his new team to lose 5‚Äì1 to the Netherlands in their opening game in Group B. Jeers and insults were heard from the local fans throughout the match. Costa also noticeably headbutted his opponent Bruno Martins Indi during the game and was subsequently substituted by his coach Vicente del Bosque for striker Fernando Torres. =Germany vs Portugal= Milorad Ma≈æiƒá, referee of the first Group G and third Group F match In the Group G game between Germany and Portugal, there were some contentious decisions by the Serbian referee, Milorad Ma≈æiƒá. In the 12th minute, Ma≈æiƒá awarded Germany a penalty as the Portuguese defender Jo√£o Pereira held back the German midfielder Mario G√∂tze, and gave Pereira a yellow card for the foul. The Portuguese players, including a very agitated Pepe, surrounded Ma≈æiƒá in protest.Thoughts on the Referees: Day Five: Milorad Mazic (SRB), Germany v. Portugal Germany's Thomas M√ºller scored the penalty to give Germany team a 1‚Äì0 lead. The penalty call was questioned by Portugal's coach Paulo Bento, who called it \\"forced\\". The Daily Telegraph's Mark Ogden labelled it \\"another example of questionable refereeing at this World Cup as contact appeared slight, certainly not enough to force G√∂tze, who made the most of the challenge, off his feet\\". In the 37th minute, Portuguese defender Pepe headbutted Thomas M√ºller, and was shown a straight red card. The former World Cup referee Brian Hall condemned M√ºller for using theatrical action to \\"gain unfair advantage\\" by \\"tricking the referee\\". The situation turned out to be the match's biggest talking point with observer reaction generally centred on the condemnation of Pepe's actions and whether M√ºller overemphasised the initial contact. In the 75th minute, Ma≈æiƒá failed to award a penalty kick to Portugal, prompting much irritation from the players. Germany ended up winning 4‚Äì0, with M√ºller scoring three goals. In his post-match comments, Bento said Ma≈æiƒá showed \\"bias\\" on both occasions, adding, \\"I am not saying it was only the referee's fault. We also made mistakes but the circumstances of what happened in the first half made the rest of the game difficult for us...The sending-off was forced on the player. I don't know if it was because of Pepe's reputation. It depends what sort of a reputation you think Pepe has.\\" =Cameroon vs Croatia: Assou-Ekotto headbutts Moukandjo= Much attention was given to apparent action of Beno√Æt Assou-Ekotto to headbutt his Cameroonian teammate, Benjamin Moukandjo. The incident was seemingly missed by officials but was captured on playback. Assou-Ekotto later attributed this to frustration.Ekotto Reveals Truth About Head Butt: Benoit Assou-Ekotto Reveals Why He Decided To Headbutt Benjamin Moukandjo, by SL International.

Pinto shortly preceded to charge at the referee's assistant, with Costa Rica's staff and substitutes following his lead. Former World Cup referee Graham Poll later tweeted, \\"HUGE moment in this match, how have Costa Rica not got a penalty?! Joel Campbell gets behind the Italy defence to race through on goal before he is clumsily brought down by a push from Giorgio Chiellini.\\" Nevertheless, Costa Rican midfielder Bryan Ruiz scored a goal within a minute, winning the game for Costa Rica 1‚Äì0.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25285190 =Argentina vs Iran= Iran national team players Ashkan Dejagah and Masoud Shojaei protesting Milorad Ma≈æiƒá During the Group F game between Argentina and Iran, Serbian referee Milorad Ma≈æiƒá allegedly failed to award a penalty kick that would have favoured Iran. In addition to sparking a furious response from the Iranian players who rushed and bumped the referee,Thoughts on the Referees: Day Ten: Milorad Mazic (SRB), Argentina v. Iran Ma≈æiƒá's non-call on Argentine defender Pablo Zabaleta's penalty area challenge on Iranian midfielder Ashkan Dejagah in the 55th minute produced a post-match discussion on whether a foul had been committed. Iranian print media, including the Jam-e-jam, Quds, and Iran daily newspapers, lambasted Ma≈æiƒá over his decision not to award a penalty shot, citing him as the reason Argentina won the match, Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey of Pravda.ru declared Ma≈æiƒá \\"either biased or incompetent\\" before proclaiming his 55th minute decision \\"a disgusting comment on the quality of referees chosen to manage the games of the FIFA World Cup\\", Metro wrote that despite Zabaleta getting his toe to the ball when tackling Dejagah, \\"replays showed Iran should've been awarded a spot-kick\\", SB Nation's Kim McCauley felt Dejagah had a \\"strong claim for a penalty\\". However, The Guardian's Barney Ronay and the Associated Press's Karl Ritter wrote in their reports that television replays suggest Zabaleta had gotten a touch on the ball first before bringing down Dejagah and therefore did not foul the Iranian. The Daily Telegraph also thought that the call was correct: \\"[Dejagah] is screaming for a penalty, so much so that he almost manhandles the referee in his frustration. I've no idea why, as replays suggest Zabaleta won the ball, albeit a little clumsily.\\" Iran's coach Carlos Queiroz questioned the 55th-minute non-call in his post- match comments, saying, \\"It should have been a penalty and red card. There's no excuse. There's nothing that can explain [why] this Serbian referee [did] not give the penalty. How can this guy sleep tonight, or for the rest of his life? With all respect, I would like to have the opportunity to have a one-on- one conversation with him. Why did he do that to us?\\" Argentina's coach Alejandro Sabella supported Ma≈æiƒá's non-call, feeling that Zabaleta got the ball first in his challenge. Two days after the match, the Iranian Football Federation filed an official complaint to FIFA over Ma≈æiƒá's refereeing. Signed by the Federation's general secretary Mehdi Mohammad Nabi, among other things it read, \\"Unfortunately the referee‚Äôs mistake altered the outcome of the game and helped the Argentine side edge past us\\". =Nigeria vs Bosnia and Herzegovina: D≈æeko's disallowed goal= During the Group F match between Nigeria and Bosnia and Herzegovina, New Zealand referee Peter O'Leary disallowed a goal to Bosnia and Herzegovina due to an incorrect offside call from his assistant. Nigeria won the game 1‚Äì0, which meant that Bosnia and Herzegovina were mathematically eliminated from advancing to the knockout stage. The referee was later pictured appearing to celebrate with Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama after the match's end, an incident that Bosnian forward Edin D≈æeko, the scorer of the disallowed goal, called \\"shameful\\".\\"20,000 Sign Petition After Referee Seen 'Celebrating' With Nigerian Player\\" Buzzfeed.com. Accessed 9 July 2014. On 9 November 2014, Peter O'Leary, the game referee speaking to The New Zealand Herald admitted D≈æeko's goal was disallowed in error. =Greece vs Ivory Coast= In the final Group C game between Greece and Ivory Coast, Ecuadorean referee Carlos Vera awarded Greece a late penalty kick in the 91st minute of the match when he called a foul on Ivory Coast forward Giovanni Sio in a play where replays showed that Greek midfielder Georgios Samaras stubbed his foot into the pitch after the contact and fell down, which has been seen as controversial. Samaras converted the subsequent penalty kick to give Greece a 2‚Äì1 victory, which meant that they would advance on to the knockout stage. Had the penalty not been called, Ivory Coast would have advanced in a 1‚Äì1 draw. FIFA, however, accepted the penalty by appointing the referee as Fourth Official on the Final. =Croatia vs Mexico= During the Group A match between Croatia and Mexico, the Uzbek referee Ravshan Irmatov declined awarding a penalty after a possible handball by the Croatian defender Darijo Srna and did not send off Rafael M√°rquez, who later scored the first goal. =Uruguay vs Italy: Claudio Marchisio's red card and Luis Su√°rez biting incident= Uruguayan forward Luis Su√°rez (far back left) with the Uruguay national team at the Group D match In the 59th minute, the Italian midfielder Claudio Marchisio made a high challenge on Egidio Ar√©valo R√≠os and shown a straight red card by the referee. Italy's coach Cesare Prandelli argued against this decision and claimed that the Mexican referee Marco Antonio Rodr√≠guez had been showing bias against Italy, which had ruined the game for the Azzurri. Many other referees also considered this decision to be very harsh, and quoted \\"Marchisio had just a normal tackle on Rios, How is this a red card?\\" In the 79th minute of the match, Uruguay's striker Luis Su√°rez clashed with Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini while waiting for a cross. Replays showed that Su√°rez lunged at Chiellini and bit his shoulder, after which Su√°rez fell and clutched his face. As the Italian players protested to Rodr√≠guez for not penalising Su√°rez, Uruguay won a corner and their defender Diego God√≠n scored. The game finished 1‚Äì0 to Uruguay, allowing them to qualify to the knockout stage as the Group D runners-up. Italy, who had also lost their previous game, were eliminated, finishing third in the group. It was the second successive time they had failed to qualify past the group stage in a World Cup, having won it in 2006. FIFA announced later the same day that it had opened disciplinary proceedings against Su√°rez. Su√°rez had been found guilty of biting opponents on two previous occasions: Otman Bakkal in 2010 and Branislav Ivanoviƒá in 2013. He received a seven-game ban for the first incident and a ten-game ban for the second, where he was criticised for not recognising \\"the seriousness\\" of it. On 26 June 2014, the FIFA Disciplinary Committee banned Su√°rez for nine international matches, effective immediately, meaning he would take no further part in the World Cup. It was the longest such ban in World Cup history, exceeding the eight-match ban handed to Italy's Mauro Tassotti for breaking the nose of Spain's Luis Enrique at the 1994 World Cup. He was also banned from taking part in any football-related activity, including entering any stadium, for four months and fined CHF100,000 (approx. ¬£65,700/‚Ç¨82,000/US$119,000). The severity of the penalty was due to the fact that it was Su√°rez's third biting offence, as well as what FIFA saw as a lack of remorse. With Su√°rez banned, Uruguay lost their next match 2‚Äì0 to Colombia and were knocked out of the World Cup. On the same day the ban was announced, the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) said it would appeal against the decision. Su√°rez's lawyer claimed that \\"we don't have any doubts\\" of a European-based campaign against Su√°rez. Various Uruguayan individuals defended Su√°rez, questioning if he had actually bitten Chiellini, and criticised the severity of his ban, including the President of Uruguay Jos√© Mujica, who labelled the ban \\"fascist\\" and called FIFA \\"a bunch of old sons of bitches\\"; the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) president Wilmar Valdez, Uruguay's captain Diego Lugano and their coach √ìscar Tab√°rez, who resigned from two FIFA posts in protest. The Uruguayan media were also noted to have been in a defiant and defensive mood. Chiellini called the ban \\"excessive\\", while the international players' union FIFPro called for Su√°rez to \\"receive all the support he needs\\" and that the \\"focus should be on the rehabilitation and serious treatment\\" of Su√°rez. Six days after the incident, on 30 June, Su√°rez apologised to Chiellini through Twitter and vowed never to repeat the incident, while writing that the \\"physical result of a bite\\" occurred in a collision with Chiellini. Chiellini responded through Twitter indicating that all was forgotten and his hope that FIFA would reduce Su√°rez's suspension. On 3 July, the AUF appealed against Su√°rez's ban, but it was rejected by FIFA on 10 July. With the ban not preventing Su√°rez from transferring to another club, it was announced on 11 July that Su√°rez had agreed to move to Barcelona. Before the transfer, Barcelona's club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said the apology was \\"honourable\\", their sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta welcomed Su√°rez as being \\"humble enough to admit an error\\" and their new signing Ivan Rakitiƒá commended Su√°rez's \\"character and strength\\". =Russia vs Algeria: laser used against Russian goalkeeper= Russian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev The final group stage match between Algeria and Russia on 26 June ended 1‚Äì1, thus advancing Algeria to the knockout stage and eliminating Russia. A win for Russia would have seen them qualify, and they led the game 1‚Äì0 after six minutes with a goal from forward Aleksandr Kokorin. In the 60th minute of the game, a moving green light ‚Äì most likely produced by a laser pointer ‚Äì was shone in Russian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev's face while he was defending from an Algerian free-kick, which striker Islam Slimani scored from to equalise. Russia's coach Fabio Capello blamed the laser for the decisive conceded goal, saying, \\"The goalkeeper was unable to do his job. The laser was in his face. It is not an excuse. You can see the footage.\\" After the match, the Algerian Football Federation (AFF) was fined CHF50,000 (approx. ¬£33,000/‚Ç¨41,100/US$56,200) by FIFA for the use of lasers and other violations of the rules by Algerian fans on the stadium. Laser pointers were a prohibited item on the stadium, according to FIFA Stadium Safety and Security Regulations. Knockout stage =Brazil vs Chile= The first Round of 16 match, between Brazil and Chile, resulted in some confusions and controversies. There was some doubt if the first goal of the match, scored by Brazil, was an own goal by Chile defender Gonzalo Jara, although FIFA confirmed that the goal was scored by Brazil's David Luiz. English referee Howard Webb was criticised for calls which might have been too close or harsh, especially against Brazil: BBC Sports commentator and former England striker Gary Lineker said in a video that Webb made some \\"iffy decisions\\", such as denying a penalty kick award to Brazil forward Hulk at 13 minutes \\"that looked like it possibly was\\", and calling a handball against the same player at 55 minutes that was \\"a little bit harsh\\". Hulk had put the ball into Chile's net, but the referee ruled that he had controlled the ball using his arm. The goal was disallowed and he was shown the yellow card. Other commentators (including former England footballer Michael Owen, via Twitter) also questioned the handball decision against Hulk (made by English assistant referee Michael Mullarkey) as being a call which might have been too close. Brazilian coach Scolari criticized the refereeing, mentioning that opposition teams were trying to injure Neymar, saying he had experienced the same thing with Cristiano Ronaldo when he was coaching Portugal. =Netherlands vs Mexico= Dutch winger Arjen Robben With the score 0‚Äì0, one minute into stoppage time of the first half in the Round of 16 match between Mexico and the Netherlands, Mexican defenders Rafael M√°rquez and H√©ctor Moreno double fouled Dutch winger Arjen Robben, who was in possession of the ball in the penalty box. Portuguese referee Pedro Proen√ßa waved to \\"play on\\", though Moreno's foul was so hard that he broke his own shinbone and had to be stretchered off the field. Arjen Robben denied clear penalty against Mexico at soccerly.com While the score was 1‚Äì1, one minute into stoppage time of the second half, Robben again went down inside the area following another foul by M√°rquez, in which M√°rquez stepped on Robben's foot. This time the Netherlands was given a penalty kick, which striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar converted for the game-winning goal, eliminating Mexico with a 2‚Äì1 win. Robben, who has a reputation for diving, was condemned widely in the press for his \\"theatrical fall\\" to earn the decisive penalty. After the match, Mexico's coach Miguel Herrera was seen arguing with referee Proen√ßa and later claimed, in an interview, \\"This was a World Cup where everyone was against Mexico.\\" After the match, Robben admitted to going to ground too easily once during the game and said, \\"I must apologize. The one [at the end] was a penalty, but the other one just outside the box I went to ground too easily. I shouldn't be doing that.\\" Robben also said that the pair of fouls against him, while he was inside the box during the first half, should have been awarded a penalty. M√°rquez claimed that Robben confessed to him at the end of the match that \\"it [the 90'+1 tackle] wasn't a penalty, though one of the previous was\\"; the Royal Dutch Football Association KNVB suggested that Robben's words were mistranslated. =France vs Nigeria= After the Round of 16 match between France and Nigeria, American referee Mark Geiger was accused by multiple Nigerian players, most notably midfielders Ogenyi Onazi and John Obi Mikel, forward Peter Odemwingie, as well as by Nigeria's coach Stephen Keshi, of having bias against Nigeria. Geiger was criticised for several calls throughout the game. This included a goal by Nigerian striker Emmanuel Emenike being cancelled for offside (although television replays suggest this may have been the correct decision); no red card for an apparent attempt by French striker Olivier Giroud to elbow Nigerian midfielder Mikel, no penalty being called against French left-back Patrice Evra for holding Odemwingie during a corner, a general lack of protection from the referee for persistent rough play and, most notably, only a yellow card being issued for a studs-in tackle by French midfielder Blaise Matuidi, which resulted in midfielder Onazi's left leg tendon being torn apart and requiring surgery, and forced to be substituted for midfielder Reuben Gabriel. Several commentators like Allan Jiang of Bleacherreport and Patrick Johnson of Yahoo! News noted that the decisions significantly impacted the match, especially the forced substitution of Onazi, which changed the complexion of the game, depriving Nigeria of its most influential midfielder. =Brazil vs Colombia= Filled with controversy, the quarter-final between Brazil and Colombia saw a record number of fouls in a World Cup match (31 committed by Brazil and 23 by Colombia, totalling 54, with only 4 yellow cards), including one committed by Colombian defender Juan Camilo Z√∫√±iga as he kneed the Brazilian forward Neymar in the back in the 88th minute, which resulted in the striker's withdrawal from the match and the tournament. The action was not awarded a card nor even a foul. Subsequent medical evaluation discovered a fractured vertebra, forcing the Brazilian to miss the remainder of the tournament. After the match, which Colombia lost 2‚Äì1, Z√∫√±iga insisted that he had not meant to injure Neymar. Neymar's teammate Thiago Silva defended Z√∫√±iga, stating that he is not the type of player who would purposely cause an injury to any player. On 5 July, it was revealed that Z√∫√±iga had sent a letter of apology to Neymar, saying that he was \\"deeply sorry and sad\\" for unintentionally causing the injury. On the other hand, Ronaldo believed that Z√∫√±iga intended to hurt Neymar, saying that the very high knee in the back was highly violent and even an unlawful move. Many media and football figures, such as Diego Maradona, criticised FIFA and the Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo, claiming \\"favouritism\\" towards Brazil, for disallowing a goal from the Colombian defender Mario Yepes and allowing too many fouls by the Brazilians to occur without punishment, leading the Colombians to play aggressively as well. There have been arguments that had Carballo properly controlled the game, fewer fouls (as well as Neymar's injury) may have occurred. Despite the controversy, Colombia were awarded the FIFA Fair Play Trophy for the tournament. =Brazil vs Netherlands= In the second minute of the third-place play-off, Thiago Silva pulled down Arjen Robben as he ran into J√∫lio C√©sar's box with the ball for a clear goal-scoring opportunity. Under IFAB laws, Silva ought to have been shown a red card, but he was shown a yellow card instead by the Algerian referee Djamel Haimoudi. The referee called for a penalty, while the foul happened outside the box, which was eventually scored by Robin van Persie. The Netherlands' second goal in the 16th minute was later shown to be offside, which was ignored by the referees. Haimoudi had another controversial call in the 67th minute when he showed Brazilian midfielder Oscar a yellow card for diving, the only such instance in this tournament when replays showed that he was taken down in the box by opponent Daley Blind. Blind had to leave the pitch with an injury after the incident, further confirming that there was significant contact between the two players. =Germany vs Argentina= In the second half of the final, German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer collided with Gonzalo Higua√≠n in mid-air while trying to punch the ball out inside the penalty box. Referee Nicola Rizzoli decided against the call for a penalty kick, and concluded that Gonzalo Higuain had fouled Neuer, so he gave Germany a free-kick. Some people felt Neuer should have been shown a red card and Argentina awarded a penalty. Safety =Construction= A fire broke out at the Arena Pantanal in Cuiab√° in October 2013 Stadium construction for the 2014 World Cup was plagued by accidents, cost overruns and delays, with eight workers dying in various accidents while building the World Cup's 12 arenas. In late October 2013, a fire during construction of the Arena Pantanal at Cuiab√° in Mato Grosso state came 24 hours after the state governor warned the stadium might not be 100 percent complete in time for the deadline. Footage also emerged of fans climbing what appeared to be an unstable staircase made with scaffolding leading to the Maracan√£ Stadium, before the Argentina‚ÄìBosnia and Herzegovina match. =Breaches into stadiums= The Maracan√£ Stadium in Rio de Janeiro At Chile's Group B match against Spain on 18 June, about 100 Chilean supporters who had gathered outside Maracan√£ Stadium forced their way in. They broke through security, after one fan pretended to be sick to distract the guard. They proceeded into the media centre, smashed the glass door, knocked over two partition walls and entered the stadium. Military police reported that 85 Chileans were detained during the events, while others had reached the stands. Earlier, on 15 June, about 20 Argentinians made a similar breach during the Argentina‚ÄìBosnia and Herzegovina match at the same stadium. =Violence between England fans= On 19 June during England's match against Uruguay in S√£o Paulo, an England football supporter was assaulted and had a piece of his ear bitten off by another England fan, British police reported. Brazilian officers started an investigation after the attacked fan made a complaint, but the assailant could not be identified. The confirmation of the incident came after former England striker Stan Collymore tweeted that he had seen footage of a \\"fan attacked\\". The Association of Chief Police Officers issued a statement, following Collymore's tweet, with Chief Superintendent Rachel Barber of South Yorkshire Police saying, \\"Efforts are ongoing to identify the suspect and bring him to justice either in the UK or, if possible, back in Brazil where the offence occurred\\". =Monorail collapse= On 9 June, three days before the World Cup started, a concrete support beam collapsed during construction of Line 17 of the S√£o Paulo Metro, killing one worker and injuring two others. Completion for the line, which would connect Congonhas- S√£o Paulo Airport to three other lines in the monorail network, was scheduled for the start of the tournament, but construction was delayed as it did not receive environmental approvals, and was expected to be completed by the second half of 2015. =Bridge collapse= On 3 July, an overpass under construction in Belo Horizonte as part of the World Cup infrastructure projects collapsed onto a busy carriageway below, leaving two people dead and 22 others injured. One witness blamed the accelerated construction schedules and the \\"incompetence\\" of the authorities and businesses for the disaster. =Head injuries= During the tournament, FIFA received significant criticism for the way head injuries are handled during matches. Two incidents in particular attracted the most attention. First, in a group stage match, after Uruguayan defender √Ålvaro Pereira received a blow to the head, he lay unconscious.Alvaro Pereira, knocked out then raring to go The Uruguayan doctor signaled for the player to be substituted, but he returned to the match. The incident drew criticism from the professional players' union FIFPro, and from Michel D'Hooghe, a member of the FIFA executive board and chairman of its medical committee.\\"Kramer head injury revives concussion concern\\", Sports Illustrated, 13 July 2014. Second, in the final, German midfielder Christoph Kramer received a blow to the head from a collision in the 14th minute, but returned to the match before collapsing in the 31st minute. During that time, Kramer was disoriented and confused, and asked the referee Nicola Rizzoli whether the match he was playing in was the World Cup Final.\\"Referee: Christoph Kramer unsure it was World Cup final after head blow\\", Sports Illustrated, 17 July 2014.  Aftermath  Behaviour by some members of the victorious German team in their celebration in Berlin was deemed disrespectful by media in Argentina There was controversy over Germany's victory celebration, which included a parody of the Argentina Gaucho. This event was later termed as \\"Gauchogate\\". As the national team had arrived on 15 July 2014 the tribune of the fan zone at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, voted as the national player Roman Weidenfeller, Shkodran Mustafi, Andr√© Sch√ºrrle, Miroslav Klose, Mario G√∂tze and Toni Kroos a song of victory at, for chorus of nursery rhyme it I know a cowboy, the cowboy is called Bill. The truth about the gaucho singing, Die Welt, July 16, 2014 They sang, \\"So go the Gauchos, the Gauchos go so, so go the Gauchos Ga√∫chos go like this ... \\" in a stooped posture. When changing to the second verse they took a more upright posture and sang, \\"So go the Germans, the Germans who go so ...\\" Then they asked the fans to join in the singing. Just a few hours later, the name Gauchogate was established on the social network Twitter for the response to this action. The song caused irritation in the media landscape as well as in social networks: \\"crazy idea\\" (Welt.de) and \\"bad pastiche\\" (Faz.net) and \\"the most controversial shitstorm of the Year\\" (handelsblatt.com). They ranged from appeasement, that it was only a harmless song that was sung in the intoxication of joy, to the classification as a mockery of the World Cup final opponent with a clearly racist tendency. The Argentine sports newspaper Ol√© described the scene as a polemical and the radio station Continental in Buenos Aires likened the scene and attitude to the Nazis.

It is set during the Rising of the North in 1569, and combines historical and legendary subject-matter. It has attracted praise from some critics, but has never been one of Wordsworth's more popular poems. Synopsis The White Doe of Rylstone opens outside Bolton Abbey in Wharfedale, where the poet sees the white doe enter the churchyard and lie down by one particular grave, where it is recognized as a regular visitor by the parishioners. The poem then moves back in time to Emily Norton at Rylstone Hall; at her father's command she embroiders a banner for his followers, who are to rise in rebellion. Emily's brother Francis tries unsuccessfully to dissuade their father from this course, then resolves to follow them unarmed, in the hope that he can still dissuade his father. Norton's band of soldiers, including other brothers of Emily, joins forces with those of the Earl of Northumberland and other Catholic rebels, and they march to Wetherby. On the approach of Queen Elizabeth's army the rebels fall back in retreat. The poem then returns to Rylstone Hall, where Emily encounters the white doe by moonlight. She sends an old friend of her father to get news of his fate; he returns to say that her father is taken prisoner, and that he has told Francis to regain the banner and take it to Bolton Abbey, where it can serve as an emblem of the purity of his motives. Richard almost accomplishes this task, but he is surprised by a party of the royal army and is killed. When Rylstone Hall suffers devastation Emily flees, and only returns years later, there to find the same white doe, which henceforth becomes her faithful friend, going wherever she goes. Emily at last dies and is buried at Bolton Abbey. The mystery of why the white doe visits the grave is thus explained. Sources It has been argued that Wordsworth was induced to write a historical poem by observing the success of Walter Scott's The Lay of the Last Minstrel. Wordsworth found in Thomas Whitaker's The History and Antiquities of the Deanery of Craven the legend of a white doe which, after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, continued to make a weekly pilgrimage from Rylstone to Bolton Abbey. The historical parts of the story of The White Doe are taken from a ballad called \\"The Rising in the North\\", which Wordsworth had read in Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, and also from Nicolson and Burn's The History and Antiquities of the Counties of Westmorland and Cumberland. The influence of other ballads from Percy's Reliques has also been traced in the poem, and the dedicatory poem to The White Doe is filled with references to Spenser's The Faerie Queene. The metre of the poem is similar to that of Coleridge's Christabel, and Wordsworth acknowledged his debt to it in a preface, but Scott, Virgil and Samuel Daniel have also been cited as possible influences on the metre. Composition and publication In June 1807 Wordsworth and his sister visited Bolton Abbey. Later that year he read Whitaker's account of the legend of the white doe, and, in October 1807, began to write The White Doe, finally completing it on 18 January 1808. In February 1808 Wordsworth visited London to consult Coleridge about The White Doe, and to try to sell it for, Wordsworth hoped, 100 guineas. Together the two dined with the publisher Longman to discuss the poem, then Wordsworth returned home, leaving the manuscript with Coleridge so that he could show it to Charles Lamb (who professed himself dissatisfied with the inactivity of the main characters) and continue negotiations with Longman. Dorothy Wordsworth, acutely aware of the need for money in the Wordsworth household, wrote to Coleridge to urge on his efforts. Three months later Coleridge was surprised and annoyed to discover that Wordsworth had written to Longman to the effect that he had decided not to publish the poem. When Coleridge protested to Wordsworth his objections were swept aside, provoking a serious quarrel between the two friends. Wordsworth's reason for withdrawing The White Doe may have been his dismay at the appalling reviews of his Poems, in Two Volumes; at any rate he remained unwilling to publish the poem for several more years. By 1815 however Wordsworth had come up with a revised and expanded text, for which he wrote a dedication to his wife Mary in Spenserian metre, completing it on 20 April. It was published in quarto, priced at one guinea, on 2 June. Reception Wordsworth himself believed The White Doe to be one of his finest poems, but the reviewers were at best lukewarm. The Eclectic Review did concede that \\"where he comes in contact with the ordinary sympathies of human nature, no living poet leaves so strongly the impression of a master genius\\", but Francis Jeffrey of the Edinburgh Review, a long-time foe of the Lake Poets, thought it had \\"the merit of being the very worst poem we ever saw imprinted in a quarto volume\\". Coleridge, by then in a state of uneasy reconciliation with Wordsworth, quoted a passage from The White Doe in his Biographia Literaria, praising its beauty and imaginative power. John Ruskin, in a private letter, compared it favourably with Coleridge's Christabel, calling it \\"a poem of equal grace and imagination, but how pure, how just, how chaste in its truth, how high in its end\\". Later in the century Leslie Stephen thought that the poem unduly exalted passive heroism at the expense of active heroism, and thought its \\"rough borderers\\" unlikely mouthpieces for Wordsworth's message of quietism and submission to circumstances. His wry comment was that \\"The White Doe is one of those poems which make many readers inclined to feel a certain tenderness for Jeffrey's rugged insensibility; and I confess that I am not one of its warm admirers\\". In the 20th century the critic Alice Comparetti and the poet Donald Davie were agreed in finding in The White Doe the melancholy of Thomson, Gray and Milton. Davie praised the purity of the poem's diction, which he thought unequalled in any other long Wordsworth poem; he summarised it as \\"impersonal and self-contained, thrown free of its creator with an energy he never compassed again\\". The critical verdict has therefore been mixed. Among the reading public it has never been one of Wordsworth's most popular poems, perhaps because his lofty conception of The White Doe led him to make few concessions to the ordinary poetry- reader.

History  Hondo River forming a natural border between Belize and Mexico The Yucat√°n Peninsula, today divided between the nations of Belize, Guatemala and Mexico; was once home to the Mayan civilization. In the 16th century, Spain invaded the territory and administered the land from Mexico City, seat of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. After Spanish conquest, the territory that would later be known as Belize was poorly administered and open to attacks from pirates. In the 17th century, British settlers began arriving to Belize and fought several battles to control the territory. In the late 18th century, the United Kingdom formally took over the territory of Belize. In July 1893, newly independent Mexico signed a treaty with the United Kingdom setting borders between the two nations, which is still in place today.History of diplomatic relations between Mexico and Belize (in Spanish) On 21 September 1981, Belize became an independent nation. That same day, Belize and Mexico established diplomatic relations with Mexico establishing the first embassy in the country, while the United Kingdom established a High Commission. In 1982, Belizean Prime Minister George Price became the first head of state from Belize to pay an official visit to Mexico. In 1986, Belize opened its embassy in Mexico City. In 1988, Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid became the first Mexican head of state to pay an official visit to Belize.

In 2013, his network of sites was estimated to have garnered in excess of 30 million unique visitors per month. In addition to his work with Curse, Thieblot also speaks at industry related events as a guest speaker, and has spoken at the 2011 Montgomery Technology Conference and the Login 2011 Conference. Curse As a teenager, Thieblot was a fan of World of Warcraft, a popular massively multiplayer online roleplaying game. His interest in the game led to him creating a website to organize and share World of Warcraft modifications, add- ons, and plugins to change player experience via the user interface. As traffic rose, Thieblot decided to turn his hobby into a business, dropping out of his Swiss information technology program to incorporate in 2006 as Curse, Inc. The name \\"Curse\\" derives from the name of his World of Warcraft guild (a collection of players), which at the time was one of the largest guilds in Europe. As the company began to increase in traffic and revenue, Thieblot hired his brother as the first Curse employee, and after relocating to Germany, hired a third developer to aid in the site development. During this time, the site grew both in traffic and in number of hosted modifications. In 2007, Thieblot began development on the Curse Client,http://www.curse.com/legacycontent/installing-and-using-the-curse- client a comprehensive solution to add-on management and distribution. As the client matured into beta status, its feature set became more comprehensive, supporting connections to various Curse modification databases. In 2008, with over 2/3rds of his traffic coming from the United States, Thieblot moved Curse to San Francisco and began to expand Curse into community sites, news, forums, databases, and original content. After seeking venture capital financing in 2007 and 2009,http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=35925712 Thieblot began to expand the services and scope of coverage provided by Curse.

Today, approximately 10,000 Lokono live primarily along the coasts and rivers of Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, Barbados and French Guiana. They speak the Arawak language, the eponymous language of the Arawakan language family, as well as various Creole languages, and English. Name The Lokono Artists Group Historically, the group self-identified and still identifies as 'Lokono-Arawak' by the semi fluent speakers in the tribe, or simply as 'Arawak' (by non speakers of the native tongue within the tribe) and strictly as 'Lokono' by tribal members who are still fluent in the language, because in their own language they call themselves 'Lokono' meaning 'many people' (of their particular tribe), with 'Lokobe' meaning 'some people' (of their particular tribe), 'Loko' means 'one person' (of their particular tribe) as well as the name of the language they speak...so one would say 'Da Jiabo Loko' to mean 'I speak the language' (of our tribe), the term 'Arawak' does not exist as a word anywhere in the Lokono language, and instead was given to them by the Warrau tribe of the Orinoco delta who had more frequent contact with the Spaniards of Trinidad since the early 1500s, and the name 'Arawak' was subsequently adopted by all other Europeans in the Caribbean to refer to the Lokono. About 10% or 1,000 of the 10,000 Lokono alive are fluent in their language, all aged 50 and over, with another 10% of varying ages - but mostly 30-50 in age range being semi fluent, and 80% under 30 years of age being unable to speak their native tongue but only able to speak English, Dutch, French or Spanish - as Lokono is not taught in any school system in any country. An Arawak-English Dictionary by Canon John Peter Bennet 1989 In the 19th century, when Western scholars had established that the major indigenous population of the [Caribbean] during European contact (now known as the [Ta√≠no] were culturally and linguistically related to the South American Lokono-Arawak, ethnologist [Daniel Garrison Brinton] proposed calling the Caribbean people \\"Island Arawak\\". Subsequent scholars shortened this convention to simply \\"Arawak\\", thereby causing confusion with the mainland people. In the 20th century, scholars such as Irving Rouse began using the older term Ta√≠no for the Caribbean peoples to distinguish them from mainlanders. The mainland Arawak call themselves \\"Lokono\\" (also spelled \\"Locono\\" and \\"Lokomo\\"); this has become more common in scholarly literature since the late 20th century./ref> History The Arawakan languages may have developed in the Orinoco River Valley, and subsequently spread widely as speakers migrated, becoming the region's most extensive language family by the time of European contact. The group that identified as the Arawak or Lokono settled the coastal and river valley areas of what is now Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Barbados and parts of the island of Trinidad. While the Spanish rapidly colonized the Caribbean islands, the Lokono and other mainland peoples resisted colonization for a much longer period. The Spanish were unable to subdue them throughout the 16th century. However, with increased encroachment from other European powers in the early 17th century, the Lokono allied with Spain against the neighboring Kalina (Caribs), who had allied with the English and Dutch. Subsequently, the Lokono engaged in trading relationships with the Europeans, an arrangement that led to prosperity. However, economic and social changes in the region in the early 19th century, including the end of the plantation economy, adversely affected the Lokono, and their population began to decline. In the 20th century, the Lokono began to supplement their traditional agricultural economy by selling fish and lumber and through migrant labor, and their population has begun to rise again. There are approximately 10,000 Lokono living in Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana, as well as thousands of others with Lokono ancestry. There are 100 Lokono descendants in Barbados, these are all descendants of the same family that can all trace back to the last surviving daughter of one of Guyana's last Lokono Hereditary Chiefs, who's name was Amorotahe Haubariria ('Flying Harpy Eagle'), her Lokono name as a girl was Shoko Laliwa (Little Yellow Butterfly) - later given the Christian name Marian Lucky (and later was called Princess Marian by an English Governor in colonial Georgetown Guyana), she emigrated to Barbados from Guyana in 1925 with her Dutch Husband and 6 children. This is what is known of her life story. Princess Marian of the Eagle Clan Lokono of Guyana was first called as a child 'Shoko Laliwa' (Little Yellow Butterfly) in her native language, she was born in 1879 in the Upper Demerara River Chiefdom (Toh Isauka), 115 miles south of Mackenzie/Linden Town, where her father - Hereditary Shaman Chief Amorotahe Haubariria (Flying Harpy Eagle), was the last traditional ruler of in Guyana to evade colonization. Marian had a normal traditional birth and lived a naked childhood in the Jungle Chiefdom until her 12/13th year (after her traditional 9-day long Puberty ritual), she then became the first member of the Eagle Clan Arawak ruling family nobility to become Christianised - and she was given the new English name 'Marian Lucky' by the Anglican Bishop William Piercy Austin of Guyana in 1892 (though she kept her traditional animist spiritually and practiced it in secret, praying with sacred Tobacco for her children's protection - as was observed years later by her youngest daughter Hannah who described it). Marian's father's Chiefdom was one of only 2 Palisaded Lokono villages ever found in Guyana, and its land must have been considerable, from present-day Muritaro village to Malali Village, thence to Great Falls village, thus prompting Marian to tell her children \\"Guyana became bigger when the English took over our land\\" as her children recounted her saying to them. 3 Eagle Clan Lokono brothers from the general Chiefdom's Lokono population (including Henry Simon and his wife), and who were Christianized and given the surname 'Simon' by Bishop Austin, left the Upper Demerara River Chiefdom in its last years of decline after ravages by various epidemics, and they became the 2nd founding family to create a new Lokono village called Pakuri (aka St Cuthberts Mission), on the Mahaica River, Charles Bernard and his wife from Moraikobai village on the Mahaicony River was the first person to start Pakuri Village in 1882. The 3rd Founding Lokono family of Pakuri was that of Richard Dundas and his wife who also came from Moraikobai village on the Mahaicony river. Marian met a young creole Dutch businessman called Vivian Arnold DeWever in 1899, when he worked as an apprentice trader transporting commercial goods from the Sprawstons company in Mackenzie British Guiana, to her father's Chiefdom to exchange for gold and diamonds that were found in the tribal lands. Vivian fell in love with her at first sight and the couple married, they then moved to Georgetown in 1900 - where they lived on Robb Street in the building that is now the 'Guiding Light Hotel', as upper-class socialites in the colonial business community. The title of 'Princess' was given to Marian in 1921 by the British Governor of Guiana Sir Wilfred Collet when she was invited with her husband Vivian DeWever (who then had inherited the ownership of the Argosy Newspaper and a reasonable fortune from his successful business entrepreneur father) to a Ball that was being held in the Colonial Governments 'Assembly Rooms' in Georgetown, in honor of the then HRH the Prince of Wales (who was visiting Guyana at the time), and it was the Colonial Governor who introduced Marian to HRH the Prince of Wales as 'Princess Marian of the Arawaks' (because her father was the last Hereditary Chief), and HRH the Prince of Wales had Marian and her husband seated near to him, later dancing with her twice that night, as was recorded in family oral history. That was how Marian acquired the title 'Princess' that she is still affectionately and respectfully accorded to this day because there are no words for 'Prince' or 'Princess' in the Arawak language, you are only known as the son or daughter of the Hereditary Chief. In 1925, after her husband Vivian's business in Guyana collapsed and his fortune had been lost, the couple with their 6 surviving children - Vidi Arnold DeWever, David Arnold DeWever, Ruth Della DeWever (who married James Serrao in Barbados), Martha Isabella DeWever (who married William Keith Chandler in Barbados), Hannah Mariah DeWever (who married George Cecil Corbin in Barbados), and Joshua DeWever - all emigrated to Barbados Island in the Caribbean. Marian died of a ruptured appendix in 1928, and she was buried in Westbury cemetery in the capital city of Bridgetown (Barbados), where her grave is the only known burial place of a Lokono royal in the Caribbean, and her tombstone is the only one in existence worldwide that is written both in English and the language of the Lokono people. Marian was the last fluent speaker of the Lokono language in the ruling family of the Eagle Clan, however the middle-aged and older rest of the Chiefdom's remnant surviving tribal members on Pakuri have retained the fluency of the language. Princess Marian's second son David Arnold DeWever tried valiantly to save the former Demerara Chiefdom lands for our Clan in the Law Courts of Guyana in the 1960s but was unsuccessful, he was the last member of the Clan in the Diaspora to have contact with the rest of the Tribe in Guyana - until 1992, when Princess Marian's great-grandson Damon Corrie (at age 19) married an Eagle Clan Arawak girl on Pakuri Lokono Autonomous Territory called Shirling Simon (who was 17) - herself a descendant of the Simon brothers from the old Eagle Clan Upper Demerara River Chiefdom and four of the couples children (Hatuey, Aderi, Tecumseh and Laliwa), were born on the Tribal land of Pakuri Village in Guyana. As of 2019 the Eagle clan Lokono diaspora descendants of their last Hereditary Chief number 100 in Barbados, 100 in the UK, 80 in Cuba, 10 in the USA, and 10 in Canada, with an estimated 1700 on Pakuri Lokono Territory in Guyana - where almost every tribal member alive today has some direct ancestor who was a Simon (and therefore a descendant of one of those 3 founding Simon brothers from the old Chiefdom). The Amazon is Burning - The Flames of 21st Century Resistance Inspired by Indigenous Women https://books2read.com/u/3RaD8p  Religion  Traditional Lokono practice an animist spirituality, which is not the same as any man-made Religion, as one can join or leave religion, but one is born with a natural spirituality, an inherent knowledge of what are positive actions that should be done, and what are negative actions that should not be done. The greatest virtue taught to every traditional Lokono child is generosity and love for family, clan, and tribe. Historically, The Lokono people practiced animist shamanism, among the core beliefs is that every physical object has a spiritual carbon-copy of it, that is it exists in tangible form as well as simultaneously existing in an exact replica intangible spiritual form. The Shaman/Medicine Man (Semichichi) is not 'God's representative on Earth', the Shaman is the tribe's go-between from the physical world and the spirit world. The role of the Shaman is to answer questions or seek assistance for other tribal members, not to dictate ideas or opinions to others, each Lokono can communicate directly to the Creator Deity 'Adayahirli' which is often accorded the fatherly prefix 'Awa', as the Earth itself is spoken of in feminine gender. The Moon(Kaachi) and Sun (Hadali) are also spoken of in masculine genders, as they join the Earth mother (Onabo-oyo Koyaha) to create life in the physical world (plants cannot grow without being 'fertilized' by sunlight) and women's childbirths tend to cycle with the moon, the tides also are Moon (Kaachi) assisted. Lokono women (Hiaro) are considered to be spiritually superior to Lokono men this is why the certain work or activities in the tribe are considered beneath the dignity of women, such as grave-digging, hunting, and killing other living things, with fish being the sole exception, Lokono women and men can kill fish, but only the men can hunt and kill other animals, both genders can gather fruit and crops, though certain crops only women are supposed to plant the seeds, and only men may dig the holes in the ground that the women will then plant in. There are strict gender roles in traditional Lokono society. The belief is that everything in the physical world can be said to have a spiritual component to it, but only humans have what can best be described as a third immortal conscious energy core or true self, that comes from the spirit world into the physical world, and can choose to temporarily or permanently remain in the spirit world (Ayonbanan) after leaving the physical world, the spirit world is seen as the 'real world' and the true place of origin for all life, or return to the physical world in a new and different human body, at a different time, to temporarily inhabit it and dwell among the living once again. https://books2read.com/u/bpE9gX Amazonia's Mythical and Legendary Creatures in the Eagle Clan Lokono-Arawak Oral Tradition of Guyana The use of Tobacco (Yuri) was central to this ancient belief system, however, Tobacco being a sacred plant was never traditionally smoked for recreational purposes, but only during prayers for the physical or spiritual healing of others. It is also taboo to mix Tobacco with any other substance to smoke while praying. So whereas a hand-rolled Tobacco leaf cigar would be sacred, a factory-made commercial cigarette would be sacrilege. Tobacco smoke is also used in blessing and purification ceremonies such as in Lokono girls 9 days long and Lokono boys 4-day long puberty rituals, as well as when the followers of traditional Lokono spirituality gather together for ritual occasions, the lit Tobacco cigar would be passed around the circle of Lokono persons in the circular traditional Bahi (house), as the circle is considered the most sacred shape, and each person would smoke it briefly as it is believed that there will be no lies between those smoking the Tobacco, or the transgressor would incur a personal misfortune for breaking this taboo. Pakuri Village in Guyana (population 1700 Lokono) is the only Lokono community left that has a traditional Bahi dedicated solely for the purpose of traditional animist spirituality. It exists at Ayonto Hororo at the most southern permanently inhabited family homestead in the 240 square mile autonomous tribal territory, about 5% of the tribe still follows traditional animist spirituality, some in secret, others openly at Ayonto Hororo, due to the fact that it was driven underground by European Christian Missionaries who tried to eradicate traditional Lokono spiritual beliefs. The traditional Lokono animist belief is that one cannot be trained to become a Shaman/Medicine Man (Semihichi), but a child who exhibits the necessary gifts and qualities of one destined to become a Shaman, can be guided and assisted in his learning by one who already is a Shaman. Women were not recorded as ever having been Shamans in Lokono culture, though knowledge of plant cures was not gender-specific. The gifts a child destined to be a Shaman included being gifted from early childhood with accurate premonition dreams, visions, the ability to heal by touch and by auto-suggestion etc. Lokono Animist Traditionalists group, Pakuri Village, Lokono-Arawak Territory, Guyana, South America contacted via Instagram @eagleclanarawaks Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology, Bulletin 143, Handbook of South American Indians, Volume 3, the Tropical Forest Tribes, published in 1948; pages 825-858 The Lokono of Suriname are the only ones who have preserved their ancient clan names in their official surnames, with Karowfodi, Biswana, Jubithana and Sabjo being prominent names.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Nashua River Wild and Scenic River Study Act would amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate certain segments concerning the Nashua River in Massachusetts for study for potential addition to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The bill would direct the United States Secretary of the Interior to complete a study of the Nashua River in Massachusetts and New Hampshire and to report to Congress. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on June 12, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 412 would require the National Park Service (NPS) to study segments of the Nashua River in Massachusetts and New Hampshire for potential addition to the Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Based on information provided by the NPS, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the legislation would cost about $350,000 over the next three years, assuming the availability of appropriated funds. Enacting H.R. 412 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 412 contains no intergovernmental or private- sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Nashua River Wild and Scenic River Study Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on January 23, 2013 by Rep. Niki Tsongas (D, MA-3). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation. It was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-166 on July 22, 2013. Debate and discussion The bill was endorsed by the Massachusetts towns that would be affected: Lancaster, Massachusetts, Harvard, Massachusetts, Shirley, Massachusetts, Ayer, Massachusetts, Groton, Massachusetts, Dunstable, Massachusetts, Pepperell, Massachusetts, Townsend, Massachusetts. The Nashua River Watershed Association's Executive Director Elizabeth Ainsley Cambell testified in a hearing about the bill, arguing that \\"this legislation, which has strong local and state support, will help advance the protection of the entire river system.\\" Rep. Tsongas, who sponsored the bill, discussed the river's history and past pollution problems in her testimony about the bill. She argued that the study would allow stakeholders to work together to \\"ensure that it remains a great place for canoeing, fishing, and enjoying the outdoors.\\" The United States Department of the Interior (DOI) supported the bill, arguing that the river exhibits \\"the types of qualities and resource values that would make it a worthy and important candidate for potential addition to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.\\" The DOI did say, however, that it would prefer to prioritize the 30 other similar studies before working on this one. The Wilderness Society also supported the bill, arguing that if the river was considered eligible, then legislation could be introduced that \\"would clean up polluted waters near the river, keep drinking water supplies clean, and protect the river for its multiple uses.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 412 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 412 *GovTrack.us H.R. 412 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 412 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 412 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 412 *House Report 113-166 on H.R. 412 Category:United States proposed federal environmental legislation Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:2013 in the environment ","title":"Nashua River Wild and Scenic River Study Act"},{"id":"43069026","text":"Logo of the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel, intended to evoke the five science drivers of particle physics The Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) is a scientific advisory panel tasked with recommending plans for U.S. investment in particle physics research over the next ten years, on the basis of various funding scenarios. The P5 is a temporary subcommittee of the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel (HEPAP), which serves the Department of Energy's Office of Science and the National Science Foundation. , the panel was chaired by Steven Ritz of the University of California, Santa Cruz.  2014 Report  In 2013, HEPAP was asked to convene a panel (the P5) to evaluate research priorities in the context of anticipated developments in the field globally in the next 20 years. Recommendations were to be made on the basis of three funding scenarios for high-energy physics: * A constant funding level for the next three years followed by an annual 2% increase, relative to the FY2013 budget * A constant funding level for the next three years followed by an annual 3% increase, relative to the proposed FY2014 budget * An unconstrained budget In May 2014, the first P5 report since 2008 was released. The 2014 report identified five \\"science drivers\\"‚Äîgoals intended to inform funding priorities‚Äîdrawn from a year-long discussion within the particle physics community. These science drivers are: * Use of the Higgs boson as a tool for further inquiry * Investigation of the physics of neutrino mass * Investigation of the physics of dark matter * Investigation of the physics of dark energy and cosmic inflation * Exploration of new particles, interactions, and physics principles = Recommendations = In pursuit of the five science drivers, the 2014 report identified three \\"high priority large category\\" projects meriting significant investment in the FY2014‚Äì2023 period, regardless of the broader funding situation: the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (a proposed upgrade to the Large Hadron Collider located at CERN in Europe); the International Linear Collider (a proposed electron-positron collider, likely hosted in Japan); and the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (an expansion of the proposed Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment, to be constructed at Fermilab in Illinois and at the Homestake Mine in South Dakota). In addition to these large projects, the report identified numerous smaller projects with potential for near-term return on investment, including the Mu2e experiment, second- and third-generation dark matter experiments, particle-physics components of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), cosmic microwave background experiments, and a number of small neutrino experiments. The report made several recommendations for significant shifts in priority, namely: * An increase in the proportion of the high-energy physics budget devoted to construction of new facilities, from 15% to 20%-25% * An expansion in scope of the Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment to a major international collaboration, including redirection of resources from other R&D; projects to the development of higher powered proton beams for the neutrino facility * Increased funding for second-generation dark matter detection experiments * Increased funding of cosmic microwave background (CMB) research The panel stressed that the most conservative of the funding scenarios considered would endanger the ability of the U.S. to host a major particle physics project while maintaining the necessary supporting elements.

It causes a bark canker that occurs on oak trees (Quercus). It is an aggressive, widespread bark parasite on saplings, young trees and on branches of older trees of many oaks. The symptoms are a 0.5‚Äì3 mm-long elliptic coloured spot that appears at the base of the branches, followed by necrosis that grows around the branch at this spot, causing the branch and shoots to die. The disease is only spread by big alpha or small beta conidia that grow from the phomopsis type (pycnidia) in the summer, and from the fusicoccum type winterhidings in September. It occurs mainly in dry (arid) habitats.

Thannhauser (1892‚Äì1976) was a German art dealer and an important figure in the development and dissemination of Modern art in Europe. Biography =Early years= Justin K. Thannhauser was born in Munich,https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/24/archives/gallery-view-the- thannhauser-collection-a-minimuseum-of-modern-art.html the son of Charlotte (Nachtigall) and (1859‚Äì1935), who was also an art dealer.http://kittymunson.com/index.php?page=art-dealer-thannhausers His family was Jewish.https://www.nytimes.com/1976/12/31/archives/justin- thannhauser-dead-at-84-dealer-in-arts-modern-masters.html As a child, Justin assisted his father in his Moderne Galerie, one of the three Thannhauser Galleries which was located in Munich. In 1911, Heinrich sent him abroad to further his academic studies, including art history, philosophy, and psychology. Justin studied in Munich, Berlin, Florence, and Paris, with renowned scholars such as Henri Bergson, Adolf Goldschmidt, and Heinrich W√∂lfflin. He later brought W√∂lfflin and other eminent guests to hold private lectures at the Moderne Galerie, helping to turn it into one of Munich's leading art galleries. While abroad, he also strengthened business contacts with artists and other important art dealers, such as Kahnweiler (Pablo Picasso's Parisian dealer) and Wilhelm Uhde. In 1912, Justin returned to Munich to work full-time at the gallery, which had become known for its combination of Munich Modernism (see Neue K√ºnstlervereinigung M√ºnchen and Der Blaue Reiter) and French avant-garde painting (see Impressionism and Post- Impressionism). His new business relationship with Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, however, led to an unprecedented exhibition of works by the Italian Futurists. This exhibition, while controversial, brought even greater notoriety to the gallery. In 1913, it held the largest and most comprehensive exhibition of Picasso's work. Justin wrote the introduction to the exhibition catalogue and soon began a close personal and professional relationship with the artist. He acquired many of Picasso's works over the years, including Woman Ironing (1904) Pablo Picasso's Woman Ironing, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and The Blind Man's Meal (1903).The Blind Man's Meal, The Metropolitan Museum of Art =World War I and the interwar period= Justin was called to serve in World War I in 1914. After being wounded in 1916, he returned to Munich and helped Heinrich to publish three large volumes cataloguing a selection of the gallery's inventory and activities. In 1918, he married his first wife, Kate. She gave birth to their two sons, Heinz and Michel, in 1918 and 1920, respectively. In 1919, as the political and economic situation in Germany continued to decline, Justin decided to move his family to Lucerne, Switzerland. There, he opened a second branch of what was now called Moderne Galerie/Thannhauser. This new venue allowed the family to sell works that were found unfavorable in Germany. Justin ran the Lucerne branch until 1921, when he was called back to Munich to assist his father, who had developed a serious condition in his larynx. The Lucerne gallery continued to be under Justin's direction until 1928, when his cousin Siegfried Rosengart assumed control and changed its name to Galerie Rosengart. Once in Munich, Justin assumed complete control of his father's gallery and brought the two branches under the name Galerien Thannhauser. He began to slowly rebuild the business's reputation, which had weakened during the war, by organizing conservative exhibitions of German paintings and works on paper. He soon returned to the avant-garde, however, showing works by Picasso and Kandinsky in 1922, an exhibition of contemporary American artists in 1923, and paintings by Vlaminck in 1925. His most daring endeavors took place in 1926, when he held exhibitions of work by George Grosz and Otto Dix. In 1927, Justin opened a third gallery in Berlin. The success of this branch quickly surpassed that of the one in Munich; he thus decided to focus completely on the former and closed the latter in 1928. His greatest achievement in the Berlin space took place in 1930, when he presented the largest exhibition of works by Matisse ever held in Germany. =World War II and post-war years= In 1937, Justin moved with this family to Paris to escape the Nazi Germany regime. Although the Nazi government considered Modern art to be \\"degenerate,\\" he had paid a steep export tax and was thus permitted to bring many important works and archive materials with him. He was, however, forced to liquidate his family's collection of classic German art in order to make this financially possible. Despite this considerable loss, he was able to open a private gallery on rue de Miromesnil. He was also voted into the Syndicat des Editeurs d'Art et N√©gotiants en Tableaux Modernes, Paris's professional society of art dealers. After the outbreak of World War II, Justin moved his family back to Switzerland, and then to New York. There, he opened another private gallery. Fortunately, he had managed to bring several important works with him to the United States; the house in Paris would later be looted by Nazi soldiers. However, due to the death of Heinz (who was killed in combat in 1944) and the poor health of Michel (who would ultimately die in 1952), Justin canceled his plans to open a public gallery and placed a large number of works up for auction in 1945. He remained in New York until 1971, where he continued to operate the private gallery, collected art, and assisted museums and galleries with exhibitions and acquisitions. He also hosted many international cultural luminaries in his home, including Picasso, Louise Bourgeois, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Marcel Duchamp, Jean Renoir, John D. Rockefeller, and Thomas M. Messer, then Director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, among many others. Kate died in 1960, and he married his second wife, Hilde, two years later. In 1963, Justin decided to bequeath the essential works of his collection to the Guggenheim. The size and quality of this gift was unparalleled by any that he had made or would make again. Because the terms called for the works to be permanently installed in a designated space so that they would be publicly accessible, the Guggenheim created the Thannhauser Wing in 1965. The museum space housing the Thannhauser collection has since been expanded and restored. Justin and Hilde retired to Switzerland in 1971, and Justin died in Gstaad on December 26, 1976. After his death, Hilde continued to donate works of art to institutions around the world, including the Kunstmuseum Bern and the Guggenheim. She died in Bern in 1991.

People, places, actions or objects may be the subject of fady, which vary by region within Madagascar. The taboos are believed to be enforced by supernatural powers, and are particularly connected with Malagasy ancestor worship. Although some are held nationwide, others may be particular to regions, villages or even individual families. Fady are an integral part of Malagasy identity and play an important part in community and identity formation. Common prohibitions include those against pointing at a tomb, against the eating of eels by pregnant women and, for onlookers, against describing a newborn baby as ugly. New fady are created constantly. When a new initiative or business is started, a ritual offering (joro) must be made to prove that it is not fady. Those who break a fady (ota fady in the infinitive) are shunned as unclean (maloto) and for endangering the community's spiritual balance, regardless of whether or not the infraction was deliberate. Foreigners in Madagascar are advised to respect local fady and alter their behavior accordingly. Fady also form an important influence in other aspects of Malagasy culture. The Malagasy for \\"please\\" or \\"excuse me\\" is azafady, literally translating as \\"may it not be fady to me\\". Some writers have argued that fady are conceptually similar to unwritten social taboos in western culture, in which disregard can lead to the violator being shunned by the community.

RADIO.COM functions as a music recommender system and is the national umbrella brand for Entercom's radio network aggregating its over 235 local Entercom radio stations across the United States. In addition, the service includes thousands of podcasts. It was originally created by CBS Radio and was acquired by Entercom as part of the company's takeover of CBS Radio. The service's main competitors are rival station group iHeartMedia's iHeartRadio, and TuneIn. RADIO.COM is available online, via mobile devices, and devices such as Chromecast. History 150px The RADIO.COM domain was formerly owned by CNET Networks, which purchased it and tv.com from the nonprofit Internet Multicasting Service for $30,000 in 1996. CNET, and in turn the radio.com domain, was acquired by CBS Corporation (the parent company of CBS Radio at the time) in 2008. RADIO.COM launched on July 16, 2010 under CBS Radio. It was originally launched as a central website to stream all of CBS's then 130 radio stations, Last.fm and other CBS properties. Among the original features were currently playing information, song history, station and genre searches, presets, blogs, newsfeeds, and social media tools. Later that year the service launched its first app for iOS. In addition the service added custom channels and music from AOL Radio and Yahoo Music. In 2015, the service added a music video streaming option. These deals eventually ended quietly, especially after AOL and Yahoo's mergers into Oath. Entercom acquired CBS Radio, including RADIO.COM, on November 17, 2017. Throughout early and mid-2018, disparate individual mobile apps and sites for Entercom's legacy stations (sometimes developed outside Entercom by local third parties for individual stations, and often not being hosted universally by one provider) were withdrawn from the iTunes Store and Google Play, uniting all of Entercom's web and mobile efforts for their properties solely under the RADIO.COM app and website. The CBS Radio stations, which were part of \\"CBS Local\\" sites with their former sister television stations, also saw their main web presences moved to sub-domains of RADIO.COM. On June 25, 2018, Entercom announced that RADIO.COM would become the exclusive streaming provider for all of its stations, ending its relationship with the third-party service TuneIn. Stations previously owned by Entercom pre-merger were removed July 6, and former CBS Radio stations were removed on August 1. At that time, Entercom's stations would also begin promoting the service, in particular suffixing \\"a RADIO.COM station\\" after their legal station identifications at the top of each hour. Smart speaker integration of the service was launched within the same period. On February 7, 2019, Entercom launched stations for CNN, CNN International, HLN, Bloomberg Radio and Bloomberg Television on Radio.com along with podcasts from Turner Podcast Network via deals with Bloomberg L.P. and Turner Broadcasting. Two weeks later, Radio.com reached deals to add Bonneville International and Cox Media Group stations and podcasts to the platform. On September 25, 2019, Salem Media Group and Alpha Media joined the RADIO.COM platform.Alpha Media & Salem Media Group Stations To Join Radio.com - Radio insight (published September 25, 2019) In October 2019, the app debuted a feature called \\"Rewind\\", where a number of Entercom's spoken word content stations maintain a 24-hour on-demand buffer of programming that can be accessed through rewind, fast-forward and skip back/forward controls. On November 25, 2019, Disney Channels Worldwide agreed to terms to feature Radio Disney and Radio Disney Country's streams on RADIO.COM.Radio Disney Joins Radio.com - Radio Insight (published November 25, 2019) Availability and supported devices In addition to traditional desktop availability, the service is available via iOS/WatchOS and Android mobile and tablet devices, along with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant-compatible smart speakers and other devices. Holding to CBS Radio's longtime policy, streaming of RADIO.COM content is geo-restricted to the United States. In addition, local advertising from the advertisers of the nearest Entercom cluster of stations to a listener is substituted over a station's own advertising, along with traditional national advertising, public service announcements, and RADIO.COM features such as music news, trivia, and other minutia.

The game is a port of the PC installment Worms Clan Wars, which was released the preceding year. Set within a world history museum, the single-player story follows the player's worms attempt to retrieve the concrete donkey's stone carrot from Lord Darius-Mesmer, a worm who is using it to try to take over the world. The game is narrated by Tara Pinkle, a Lara Croft parody who is voiced by Katherine Parkinson.  Gameplay  Worms Battlegrounds is an artillery turn-based tactics/strategy game. Gameplay follows on the earlier games of the series, in which teams of worms take turns to use a variety of weapons and items in order to eliminate the opposing teams. It continues to use the mechanic that was introduced in Worms Revolution, whereby players could select their worms from four different classes: Soldier, Scout, Scientist and Heavy, which all had different play styles unique to each class. The game includes a total of sixty-five weapons and utilities, which is the same number used in two older Worms games, Worms Armageddon and Worms World Party. Among the ten new weapons is a teleport gun, which was created in response to criticism that the ninja rope wasn't authentic compared with older Worms games. The Xbox One version enables Xbox SmartGlass to keep track of stats, while the light bar on the PlayStation 4's DualShock 4 controller changes its color depending on the status of the player's worm. The speech from the worms can also be heard through the DualShock 4's internal speaker.  Additional content  The first additional downloadable content pack for Worms Battleground was titled Jacob's Invasion, and added various items to the game. It was released in January 2015. The pack adds a new game mode called 'Body Count' in which the player scores points for killing worms, as well as adding more campaign levels for the player to complete. In addition, weapons were added to the game, such as the Plasma Blaster, Energy Orbs and a UFO Strike, as well as adding various new customizable items to decorate the player's worms. The pack also added an additional five trophies and achievements to its list. Alien Invasion was released on January 12 for Xbox One and January 21 for PlayStation 4.  Reception  Worms Battlegrounds received mixed reviews. It has a Metacritic score of 62/100 and 70/100 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions respectively.

The film starred Rod La Rocque, Mitchell Lewis, Doris Kenyon, and Walter Long. The story is based loosely on the legend of Robin Hood. Plot Montero is a bandit who, along with his deaf-mute sidekick, Coloso, are planning to rob a bank. They are pursued by \\"Bob Cat\\" Manners and his posse. As they close in on the bank, owned by Perkins, Montero becomes involved in the personal affairs of Helen Wardell and her fianc√©, Howard. Perkins is also interested in Wardell, and he also holds the mortgage on Howard's ranch. Finding out that Montero has a price on his head, Perkins uses that fact to coerce Montero into agreeing to kill Howard. Perkins, however, has no intention of paying Montero, instead arranging for the posse to capture the outlaw. Montero fakes Howard's murder, and is expecting a double-cross, so he is prepared for the trap, and instead of being captured, he traps the posse. Montero then holds Perkins hostage, extorting $5,000 from him in exchange for his life, and forces Perkins, who is also Justice of the Peace, to marry Helen and Howard. Adding insult to injury, Montero gives the newlyweds the $5,000 for their honeymoon.

It included the first depiction in a talking film of a deaf character, Coloso. Although sound films could now depict deaf speech, Coloso is also mute, beginning a period in American cinema of portraying silent deaf persons. Reception Lobby card for the film. While being generally favorable to the acting in the film, NY Times critic, Mordaunt Hall, gave the film a lukewarm review, laying most of the fault in the screenplay by Smith. Motion Picture magazine gave the film a favorable review, calling it \\"delightful\\", and being particularly impressed with the script. While Motion Picture News called the film just \\"so-so\\", and gave La Rocque's performance a very negative review. However, they complimented Doris Kenyon and Mitchell Lewis' performances, as well as Harry Tierney's song, \\"Just a Little Kiss\\".

Education and teaching Chen was born in 1963 in Inglewood, California. She completed an undergraduate degree in printmaking at the University of California, Berkeley in 1984. She subsequently became interested in book arts and got a degree in book arts from Mills College in 1989. She began teaching book arts at Mills College as an adjunct in 1996 and became an associate professor in 2010. Career Chen has achieved prominence by creating conceptually sophisticated works that combine traditional techniques, such as letterpress printing and hand bookbinding, with more modern technologies such as photopolymer plates and laser cutting. She is known for pushing the structural boundaries of the artist's book with a range of architectural and sculptural approaches. At the same time, her work is praised for its high standard of production and emphasis on the artist's book as a tactile experience. Victoria Steele, the former Brooke Russell Astor Director of Collection Strategy for New York Public Library, remarked that the \\"physical form\\" of Chen's work \\"reinforces the concept and text.\\" Chen investigates the \\"complex experience\\" of book arts through her work as an artist and educator. During her time as a student at Mills College, Chen founded Flying Fish Press, publishing limited-edition artists' books. Chen typically works independently but has also produced books collaboratively with fiber artist Nance O'Banion and book artists Barbara Tetenbaum and Clifton Meador. Chen's 1992 book, Octopus, features a tunnel-like, pop-up element known in the book trade as a \\"peep show\\" and includes text written by poet Elizabeth McDevitt. It offers a three-dimensional underwater scene with the tentacles of an octopus extending behind the words, creating a physical analogue of the poem, which speaks of concealment, disguise, and distance. In 1994, Chen collaborated with fellow book artist, Ed Hutchins, on River of Stars, a small book, only three by three inches that was released in an edition of 100. Bon Bon Mots (1998), a meditation on the fleeting sweetness of life, takes the form of a box of chocolates, each of which, on being unwrapped, reveals itself as a tiny book. Each of the five 'chocolate box' books is folded differently and illustrate the range of approaches Chen brings to each project. \\"Social Graces\\" is a lotus-fold type, \\"Life Cycle\\" is a tetra-tetra flexagon, \\"Elegy\\" is a concertina with leaf-shaped pages in a clay cover, \\"Labyrinth\\" is ball-in-a-maze type of puzzle in a paper slipcase, and \\"Either/Or\\" is a \\"magic wallet\\". Chen has also worked with the volvelle or wheel chart, which is a set of stacked paper disks of varying sizes, sometimes with windows. Chen's books reflect her current interests, current events, and her own personal experiences. In 2002, she released The Veil, a work created in the time leading up to the Iraq War; Chen explains that the book \\"presents personal reflections inspired by the current political situation in the Middle East and the world\\" and is in a carousel format. Chen‚Äôs books are in the collections the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington D.C., and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Flying Fish Press Julie Chen began Flying Fish Press in 1987 as a graduate student in Book Art at Mills College in Oakland, California. Though mostly a personal press for books by Julie Chen, she has also collaborated on artist‚Äôs book projects with other artists including Lois Morrison, Barbara Tetenbaum and Clifton Meador.

He was educated at Harrow, at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge and at the Middle Temple, where he was called to the bar in 1759, and became a bencher in 1792. He was Clerk of the Deliveries of the Ordnance between 1780 and 1783. He was elected at the 1780 general election as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the rotten borough of Bletchingley in Surrey.

W. Botha on the evening of 15 August 1985 in Durban. The world was anticipating Botha to announce major reforms in his government including abolishing the apartheid system and the release of Nelson Mandela. However, the speech Botha actually delivered at the time did none of this. Background After a long period of isolation and strained diplomatic relations between South Africa and the international community, the National Party decided to hold a meeting to bring about reforms in the government. However, the meeting was shrouded in secrecy and mystery, and Botha was reported to have kept quiet and to have not participated even though he was present. This was taken as a sign that he was approving of the proposed changes. There were also reports that Botha did not participate due to his doctor's orders to avoid emotional outburst and not to engage in discussions that might upset him. At the final draft of the original agreed speech, which would be named the \\"Prog speech\\" (\\"Prog\\" being short for the Progressive Federal Party, then in opposition), and which would have recognized black human dignity, eradicated all forms of discrimination, and created equal opportunities, the nature of the speech, in conjunction with the news that a US bank was threatening to call in its loan, made Botha feel that he was being forced to capitulate to the revolutionary movements. Botha, whose fierce will had earned him the name \\"Die Groot Krokodil\\" (The Great Crocodile), simply refused and said he was not going to make that speech but was going to draft his own. The speech Due to its anticipation and publicity by different international media houses, the speech was delivered live to a worldwide audience of over 200 million. Botha clearly stated that he was not willing to change his position regarding the apartheid system and that Nelson Mandela would not be released from prison. Aftermath The speech had serious ripple effects to the economy of South Africa and it also caused South Africa to be even more isolated by the international community. The rand fell drastically against major currencies and the economy continued to shrink rapidly in growth until after the democratic handover of power a decade later.

Life The sixth son of Joseph Ellis, hotel-keeper, of Richmond, was born there on 7 June 1830. He entered, at the age of sixteen, the business of Edward Lumley of Chancery Lane, and afterwards became assistant to C. J. Stewart, a bookseller of King William Street, Strand, London from whom he acquired his knowledge of books. In 1860 he went into business for himself at 33 King Street, Covent Garden, and in 1871 took into partnership G. M. Green (1841‚Äì1872), who had been through the same training. After the death of Green in 1872, Ellis took on premises at 29 New Bond Street, previously occupied by T. & W. Boone, and carried on business, mainly in old books and manuscripts; his next partner was David White, who retired in 1884. For many years Ellis was official buyer for the British Museum, which brought him into rivalry with the rest of the trade opponents in auction rooms. In 1885 Ellis retired from business, and his stock of rarities was sold by Sotheby's for about ¬£16,000. He was succeeded in business by his nephew G. I. Ellis. Ellis died at Sidmouth on 26 February 1901, after a short illness, in his seventy-first year. Associations Ellis had a wide circle of literary and artistic friends. He was a publisher, on a small scale, and brought out works of William Morris and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who became close friends. Among other associates were A. C. Swinburne, Edward Burne-Jones and John Ruskin, whose Stray Letters to a London Bibliopole were addressed to Ellis and republished by him (1892)‚ÄîRuskin called him \\"Papa Ellis\\". It was in 1864 that Morris was first introduced by Swinburne to Ellis, and Ellis was one of the poet's executors. Works Henry Huth entrusted to Ellis the editing of the catalogue of his famous library, which was printed in 1880 (5 vols.); the English books were catalogued by William Carew Hazlitt, those in other languages by Ellis. Another catalogue compiled by Ellis was a Descriptive Catalogue of a collection of drawings and etchings by Charles Meryon, formed by the Rev. J. J. Heywood (1880, privately printed). He also produced Hor√¶ Pembrochian√¶: some account of an illuminated MS. of the Hours of the B.V.M., written for William Herbert, first earl of Pembroke, about 1440 (1880), and a biographical notice appended to an account of The Hours of Albert of Brandenburg, by William Henry James Weale (1883). After his retirement from business, Ellis spent his time writing. For the Shelley Society he wrote An Alphabetical Table of Contents to Shelley's Poetical Works (1888); and he devoted six years to compiling A Lexical Concordance to the Poetical Works of P. B. Shelley (1892). He was a supporter of Morris's Kelmscott Press, and read the proofs of the folio edition of Chaucer's Works (1896). He edited many other productions for the Press, including George Cavendish's Life of Wolsey (1893); William Caxton's Golden Legend (1892), which also appeared in the \\"Temple Classics\\" (1899 and 1900). He also wrote a metrical adaptation of Caxton's Reynard the Fox, (1894, revised 1897), edited and translated Guillaume de Lorris's and Jean de Meun's Romance of the Rose (1900, \\"Temple Classics\\"), and H. Pengelly's Memoir, with a preface (1897); and contributed memoirs to Bernard Quaritch's Dictionary of English Book Collectors. Family Ellis married in 1860 Caroline Augusta Flora, daughter of William Moates of Epsom, and left two sons and a daughter, who with his wife survived him.

However, when a railmotor service was introduced on the line in the 1900s, four new platforms were planned, and one of these was to serve Trerhyngyll and Maendy, together with Prisk and Welsh St Donats.

It was a single forty-foot platform without a shelter, passengers being confined to a fenced enclosure at the rear, which would be opened by the guard. Despite the fact that passenger numbers were adequate, the Taff Vale Railway rejected a request in 1910 for the spartan facilities to be improved.

Although there was significant variation among these economies, Soviet-type planning and Soviet-type economies refers to the major structural characteristics common to these economies. Soviet-type planning is a form of economic planning involving centralized investment decisions, administrative allocation of economic inputs, material balances to reach equilibrium between available inputs and targeted outputs, and to some extent the use of linear optimization to optimize the plans. The post- perestroika analysis of the system of the Soviet economic planning describes it as the administrative-command system due to the de facto priority of highly centralized management over planning.  Characteristics  = Institutions = The major institutions of Soviet-type planning in the USSR included a planning agency (Gosplan), an organization for allocating state supplies among the various organizations and enterprises in the economy (Gossnab) and enterprises which were engaged in the production and delivery of goods and services in the economy. Enterprises comprised production associations and institutes that were linked together by the plans formulated by Gosplan. = Material balances = Material balance planning was the major function of Gosplan in the USSR. This method of planning involved the accounting of material supplies in natural units (as opposed to monetary terms) which are used to balance the supply of available inputs with targeted outputs. Material balancing involves taking a survey of available inputs and raw materials in the economy and then using a balance-sheet to balance them with output targets specified by industry to achieve a balance between supply and demand. This balance is used to formulate a plan for the national economy.Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century, 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. . \\"Material Balance Planning\\", (P.127)  Analysis of Soviet-type planning  There are two fundamental ways scholars have carried out an analysis of Soviet-type economic planning. The first involves adapting standard neoclassical economic models and theories to analyze the Soviet economic system. This paradigm stresses the importance of Pareto efficiency standard. In contrast to this approach, scholars such as Pawel Dembinski argue that neoclassical tools are somewhat inappropriate for evaluating Soviet-type planning because they attempt to quantify and measure phenomena specific to capitalist-based economies. They contend that because standard economic models rely on assumptions not fulfilled in the Soviet system (especially the assumption of economic rationality underlying decision-making), the results obtained from a neoclassical analysis will distort the actual effects of STP. These other scholars proceed along a different course by trying to engage with STP on its own terms, investigating the philosophical, historical and political influences that gave rise to STP whilst evaluating its economic successes and failures (theoretical and actual) with reference to those contexts. The USSR practiced some form of central planning beginning in 1918 with War Communism until it dissolved in 1991, although the type and extent of planning was of a different nature before imperative centralized planning was introduced in the 1930s. While there were many subtleties to the various forms of economic organization the USSR employed during this 70-year time period, enough features were shared that scholars have broadly examined advantages and disadvantages of Soviet-type economic planning. Soviet is not the same as economic planning in general as there are other theoretical models of economic planning and modern mixed economies also practice economic planning to a certain extent, but they are not subject to all of the advantages and disadvantages enumerated here. = Advantages = From a neoclassical perspective, the advantages of STP are quite limited. One advantage of STP is the theoretical possibility to avoid inflation. Complete price stability is achievable, not only because the state plans all prices and quantities, but also because the state has complete control over the money supply via the wages it pays as the sole employer. To maintain a fixed currency value, all the state must do is balance the total value of goods available during a given planning period with the amount of wages it pays according to the following equation,Jeffries, 16. where P represents the general retail price level, Q accounts for the quantity of consumer goods and services, Y is total household income (wages paid), \\\\mathit{TP} is transfer payments, S is household saving, and T is direct household taxes: P\\\\times Q=Y+\\\\mathit{TP}-S-T However, the USSR arguably never realized this theoretical possibility.Jeffries, 16-17. It suffered from both open and repressed inflation throughout much of its history because of failure to balance the above equation. Another advantage of economic planning from the neoclassical perspective is the ability to eliminate unemployment (with the exception of frictional unemployment) and business cycles.Jeffries, 12. Since the state is effectively the sole business proprietor and controls banking, it theoretically avoids classic financial frictions and consumer confidence challenges. Because the state makes labor compulsory and can run enterprises at a loss, full employment is a theoretical possibility even when capital stocks are too low to justify it in a market system. This was an advantage that the USSR arguably realized by 1930, although critics argue that sometimes certain segments of Soviet labor exhibited zero productivity, meaning that although workers were on employment rolls, they essentially sat idle because of capital deficiencies, i.e. there was employed unemployment.Rosefield, 19. Those scholars who reject the neoclassical viewpoint consider the benefits of STP that the USSR itself adduced. One is the ability to control for externalities directly in the pricing mechanism.Dembinski, 70. Another is the total capture of value obtained in STP which is neglected in market economies.Dembinski, 69. By this, it is meant that while a worker might put in a certain amount of work to produce a good, a market might value that good at less than the cost of labor the worker put in, effectively negating the value of the work done. Because in STP prices are set by the state, STP avoids this pitfall by never pricing an item below its labor value. While these do seem to be valid theoretical advantages to STP (especially under a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist framework), it has been argued by some that STP as implemented by the USSR failed to achieve these theoretical possibilities. It is claimed that centrally-planned economies also provide a better quality of life than market economies at the same level of economic development in nearly all cases. = Disadvantages = From a neoclassical perspective, there were many disadvantages to STP. They can be divided into two categories: macroeconomic and microeconomic. Macroeconomic disadvantages included systemic undersupply, the pursuit of full employment at a steep cost, price fixing's devastating effect on agricultural incentives and the loss of the advantages of money because STP eschews money's classic role.Rosefielde, 19. Jeffries 7, 15, 19. Systemic undersupply was caused in STP because of the use of material balances (plans for the balanced production and consumption of goods and productive inputs) which are theoretically possible, but practically impossible to produce because planners cannot acquire enough information to craft them accurately. Additionally, planners had to aggregate many types of goods and inputs into a single material balance because it was impossible to create an individual balance for each of the approximately 24 million items produced and consumed in the USSR.Jeffries, 15. This system introduced a strong bias towards underproduction, resulting in a scarcity of consumer goods. Another disadvantage is that while STP does allow for the theoretically possibility of full employment, the USSR often achieved full employment by operating enterprises at a loss or leaving workers idle. There was always a Pareto superior alternative available to the USSR rather than full employment, specifically with the option to close some enterprises and make transfer payments to the unemployed.Rosefielde, 19. The microeconomic disadvantages from a neoclassical perspective include the following:Jeffries, 8, 13-15, 22. * Encouragement of black-market activity because of fixed resource allocation. * Low quality of Soviet goods induced by shielding them from world markets. * The neglect of consumer need because of the challenge in measuring good quality. * The tendency of enterprise-level Soviet managers to understate productive capacity in fear of the ratchet effect. This effect resulted from an enterprise overproducing in a given plan cycle. They would have to match their new level of higher production in the next cycle as the plan was adjusted to fit the new data. * An anti-innovation bias (also from fear of the ratchet effect). * Storming (shturmovshchina), i.e. the hurry to complete the plan at the end of a planning cycle resulting in poor production quality. * Scattering of resources, i.e. excessive spread (raspylenie sredstv), where too many projects (especially construction) would have been started simultaneously and it took much longer to complete because of a lack of available inputs on time Scholars who reject the neoclassical approach produce a shorter list of disadvantages, but because these disadvantages are valid even from the Soviet perspective, they are perhaps even more damning of STP than those listed above. These scholars consider STP's inability to predict things like weather, trade and technological advancement as an insurmountable drawback to the planning procedure.Dembinski, 71. Without exhaustive knowledge of those things, planning would systemically misappropriate resources. STP's use of coercive techniques such as the ratchet effect and labor camps which are argued to be inherent to STP on the one hand ensured the system's survival and on the other hand resulted in the distorted information that made effective planning challenging if not impossible.Dembinski, 76, 80. Lastly, these scholars argue that the semantic limitations of language made it impossible for STP planners to communicate their desires to enterprises in sufficient detail for planning to fully direct economic outcomes.Dembinski, 81. Enterprises themselves under STP still made a variety of economic decisions autonomously. After the collapse of the USSR, other scholars have argued that a central deficiency of Soviet economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand and that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.Mandel, E. 1986.

Moreover, following the fall of the USSR in 1991, this figure fell to $3,893 by 1998. By comparison, Western Europe grew from a higher base of $3,688 international dollars by a comparable 457% to $16,872 in the same period and reached $17,921 by 1998.Maddison. 2001.

The lake is located in the Tehachapi Mountains just south of the Grapevine section of Interstate 5, and within Tejon Ranch. Normal water elevations are above sea level. Geography and geology The lake lies in a natural sink at the eastern end of the Castac Valley, a rift valley formed along the Garlock Fault. The main inflows are Cuddy Creek and small intermittent streams originating in Bear and Crane Canyons, draining a total of into the lake. The lake itself was formed about 10,000 years ago, by the natural damming of water behind the alluvial fan of Cuddy Creek, blocking its natural northern outlet to Grapevine Creek. During most years the outlet sits about higher than the lake surface. During rare flooding events the lake does overflow into Grapevine Creek, which flows through a canyon into the San Joaquin Valley. History Although Castac Lake itself is saline, the abundance of freshwater springs nearby made it an attractive area for human settlement. The lake area was once the territory of the Castac and Emigdiano groups of Chumash people, who occupied the area between Tejon Pass and the modern Grapevine. Several Native American villages were located in the area, including the Emigdiano village of Sasau on the northern shore of the lake. The Chumash name for the lake was Kash-t√ºk, or \\"my eyes\\". The lake was known as A-uva-pya, or \\"in his eyes\\", in Kitanemuk, and as Sasa-u, \\"at the eye\\", in Yokuts. The lake was first seen by Spanish explorer Pedro Fages who in 1772 led the first European expedition to cross the Tehachapis via Tejon Pass into the San Joaquin Valley. Fages named the lake Salinas de Cortes and Tejon Pass the Portezuelo de Cortes. The lake's modern name may have originated from a later Spanish expedition circa 1806, in which Father Jos√© Mar√≠a de Zalvidea noted a Native American village called \\"Casteque\\" or \\"Kashtiq\\" near \\"[a lake of] pure salt water\\". In 1843 the lake was incorporated in a land grant which formed Rancho Castac. In 1854, Fort Tejon was founded in the Grapevine Valley about northwest of the lake, to command the main route (via Tejon Pass) between the Central Valley and Southern California. The Rancho Castac was eventually acquired by Edward Fitzgerald Beale, who founded Tejon Ranch (at one point the largest private landholding in California). During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the lakebed was occasionally mined for salt, as it tends to evaporate after extended periods of drought. According to historical records the lake was full through most of the 1940s, and dry in the early 1950s and early 1980s. During the mid-1990s, especially after the El Ni√±o episode in 1997, the lake filled to overflowing. Since 2001 the lake level has been artificially maintained by Tejon Ranch via pumping of groundwater in the Castac Valley area, though dropping well water levels have caused controversy over this practice. The higher lake levels have also increased the risk of overflow and flooding in Grapevine Valley, most recently in 2005. Water quality Due to the local geology, the lake contains naturally elevated levels of arsenic, boron, selenium and aluminum, which concentrate during drought conditions and are flushed out in occasional floods.

Market socialism differs from non-market socialism in that the market mechanism is utilized for the allocation of capital goods and the means of production.Buchanan, Alan E. (1985). Ethics, Efficiency and the Market. Oxford University Press US. pp. 104‚Äì105. .Gregory, Paul R.; Stuart, Robert C. (2003). Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century. p. 142. \\"It is an economic system that combines social ownership of capital with market allocation of capital...The state owns the means of production, and returns accrue to society at large.\\" . Depending on the specific model of market socialism, profits generated by socially owned firms (i.e. net revenue not reinvested into expanding the firm) may variously be used to directly remunerate employees, accrue to society at large as the source of public finance or be distributed amongst the population in a social dividend. Market socialism is distinguished from the concept of the mixed economy because models of market socialism are complete and self-regulating systems, unlike the mixed economy. Market socialism also contrasts with social democratic policies implemented within capitalist market economies. While social democracy aims to achieve greater economic stability and equality through policy measures such as taxes, subsidies and social welfare programs, market socialism aims to achieve similar goals through changing patterns of enterprise ownership and management. Although economic proposals involving social ownership with factor markets have existed since the early 19th century, the term market socialism only emerged in the 1920s during the socialist calculation debate. Contemporary market socialism emerged from the debate on socialist calculation during the early-to-mid 20th century among socialist economists who believed that a socialist economy could neither function on the basis of calculation in natural units nor through solving a system of simultaneous equations for economic coordination, and that capital markets would be required in a socialist economy. Early models of market socialism trace their roots to the work of Adam Smith and the theories of classical economics which consisted of proposals for cooperative enterprises operating in a free-market economy. The aim of such proposals was to eliminate exploitation by allowing individuals to receive the full product of their labor while removing the market-distorting effects of concentrating ownership and wealth in the hands of a small class of private owners. Among early advocates of market socialism were the Ricardian socialist economists and mutualist philosophers. In the early 20th century, Oskar R. Lange and Abba P. Lerner outlined a neoclassical model of socialism which included a role for a central planning board (CPB) in setting prices equal to marginal cost to achieve Pareto efficiency. Although these early models did not rely on conventional markets, they were labeled market socialist for their utilization of financial prices and calculation. In more recent models proposed by American neoclassical economists, public ownership of the means of production is achieved through public ownership of equity and social control of investment.  Theoretical history  = Classical economics = The key theoretical basis for market socialism is the negation of the underlying expropriation of surplus value present in other, exploitative, modes of production. Socialist theories that favored the market date back to the Ricardian socialists and anarchist economists, who advocated a free market combined with public ownership or mutual ownership of the means of production. Proponents of early market socialism include the Ricardian socialist economists, the classical liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill and the anarchist philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. These models of socialism entailed perfecting or improving the market mechanism and free price system by removing distortions caused by exploitation, private property and alienated labor. This form of market socialism has been termed free-market socialism because it does not involve planners.Property and Prophets: the evolution of economic institutions and ideologies, E. K. Hunt, published by M.E. Sharpe, , p. 72  John Stuart Mill  Mill's early economic philosophy was one of free markets that he moved toward a more socialist bent, adding chapters to his Principles of Political Economy in defence of a socialist outlook, and defending some socialist causes. Within this revised work he also made the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co- operative wage system. Nonetheless, some of his views on the idea of flat taxation remained, albeit altered in the third edition of the Principles of Political Economy to reflect a concern for differentiating restrictions on unearned incomes which he favoured; and those on earned incomes, which he did not favour. (3rd edition; the passage about flat taxation was altered by the author in this edition, which is acknowledged in this online edition's footnote 8. This sentence replaced in the 3rd ed. a sentence of the original: \\"It is partial taxation, which is a mild form of robbery\\". Mill's Principles, first published in 1848, was one of the most widely read of all books on economics in the period. As Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations had during an earlier period, Mill's Principles dominated economics teaching. In the case of Oxford University, it was the standard text until 1919, when it was replaced by Alfred Marshall's Principles of Economics. In later editions of Principles of Political Economy, Mill would argue that \\"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\\".Wilson, Fred (10 July 2007). \\"John Stuart Mill\\".

Mill also promoted substituting capitalist businesses with worker cooperatives, writing: > The form of association, however, which if mankind continue to improve, must > be expected in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a > capitalist as chief, and work-people without a voice in the management, but > the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, > collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations > and working under managers elected and removable by themselves.Principles of > Political Economy with some of their Applications to Social Philosophy, > IV.7.21 John Stuart Mill: Political Economy, IV.7.21.  Mutualism  Pierre-Joseph Proudhon developed a theoretical system called mutualism which attacks the legitimacy of existing property rights, subsidies, corporations, banking and rent. Proudhon envisioned a decentralized market where people would enter the market with equal power, negating wage slavery. Proponents believe that cooperatives, credit unions and other forms of worker ownership would become viable without being subject to the state. Market socialism has also been used to describe some individualist anarchist works which argue that free markets help workers and weaken capitalists.Murray Bookchin, Ghost of Anarcho-Syndicalism.Robert Graham, The General Idea of Proudhon's Revolution.  Individualist anarchism in the United States  For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, \\"[i]t is apparent [...] that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews. [...] William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form\\". Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist,Palmer, Brian (29 December 2010) What do anarchists want from us?, Slate.com and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, The Peaceful Revolutionist, was the first anarchist periodical published, an enterprise for which he built his own printing press, cast his own type, and made his own printing plates. Warren was a follower of Robert Owen and joined Owen's community at New Harmony, Indiana. Josiah Warren termed the phrase \\"cost the limit of price\\", with \\"cost\\" here referring not to monetary price paid but the labor one exerted to produce an item.\\"A watch has a cost and a value. The COST consists of the amount of labor bestowed on the mineral or natural wealth, in converting it into metals‚Ä¶\\". Warren, Josiah. Equitable Commerce Therefore, \\"[h]e proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce\\". He put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental \\"labor for labor store\\" called the Cincinnati Time Store where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labor. The store proved successful and operated for three years after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism. These included Utopia and Modern Times. Warren said that Stephen Pearl Andrews' The Science of Society, published in 1852, was the most lucid and complete exposition of Warren's own theories.Charles A. Madison. \\"Anarchism in the United States\\". Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 6, No. 1. (Jan. 1945), p. 53 Later, Benjamin Tucker fused the economics of Warren and Proudhon and published these ideas in Liberty calling them \\"Anarchistic- Socialism\\".Benjamin Tucker. Instead of a Book, p. 404 Tucker said: \\"[T]he fact that one class of men are dependent for their living upon the sale of their labour, while another class of men are relieved of the necessity of labour by being legally privileged to sell something that is not labour. [...] And to such a state of things I am as much opposed as any one. But the minute you remove privilege [...] every man will be a labourer exchanging with fellow- labourers. [...] What Anarchistic-Socialism aims to abolish is usury [...] it wants to deprive capital of its reward\\". American individualist anarchists such as Tucker saw themselves as economic market socialists and political individualists while arguing that their \\"anarchistic socialism\\" or \\"individual anarchism\\" was \\"consistent Manchesterism\\".Tucker, Benjamin (1926). Individual Liberty: Selections from the Writings of Benjamin R. Tucker. New York: Vanguard Press. pp. 1‚Äì19.

Cp. Tucker, \\"Socialism.\\" = Neoclassical economics =  Early 20th century  Beginning in the early 20th century, neoclassical economic theory provided the theoretical basis for more comprehensive models of market socialism. Early neoclassical models of socialism included a role for a central planning board (CPB) in setting prices equal marginal cost to achieve Pareto efficiency. Although these early models did not rely on conventional markets, they were labeled market socialist for their utilization of financial prices and calculation. Alternative outlines for market socialism involve models where socially owned enterprises or producer co-operatives operate within free markets under the criterion of profitability. In recent models proposed by American neoclassical economists, public ownership of the means of production is achieved through public ownership of equity and social control of investment. The earliest models of neoclassical socialism were developed by Leon Walras, Enrico Barone (1908)F. Caff√© (1987), \\"Barone, Enrico\\", The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, , v. 1, p. 195.Enrico Barone, \\"Il Ministro della Produzione nello Stato Collettivista\\", Giornale degli Economisti, 2, pp. 267‚Äì93, trans. as \\"The Ministry of Production in the Collectivist State\\", in F. A. Hayek, ed. (1935), Collectivist Economic Planning, pp. 245‚Äì290. and Oskar R. Lange (c. 1936).Robin Hahnel (2005), Economic Justice and Democracy, Routledge, , p. 170 Lange and Fred M. Taylor (1929) proposed that central planning boards set prices through \\"trial and error\\", making adjustments as shortages and surpluses occurred rather than relying on a free price mechanism. If there were shortages, prices would be raised; if there were surpluses, prices would be lowered.Mark Skousen (2001), Making Modern Economics, M.E. Sharpe, , pp. 414‚Äì15. Raising the prices would encourage businesses to increase production, driven by their desire to increase their profits, and in doing so eliminate the shortage. Lowering the prices would encourage businesses to curtail production to prevent losses, which would eliminate the surplus. Therefore, it would be a simulation of the market mechanism, which Lange thought would be capable of effectively managing supply and demand.J√°nos Kornai (1992), The Socialist System: the political economy of communism, Oxford University Press, , p. 476. Although the Lange‚ÄìLerner model was often labelled as market socialism, it is better described as market simulation because factor markets did not exist for the allocation of capital goods. The objective of the Lange‚ÄìLerner model was explicitly to replace markets with a non-market system of resource allocation. H. D. Dickinson published two articles proposing a form of market socialism, namely \\"Price Formation in a Socialist Community\\" (The Economic Journal 1933) and \\"The Problems of a Socialist Economy\\" (The Economic Journal 1934). Dickinson proposed a mathematical solution whereby the problems of a socialist economy could be solved by a central planning agency. The central agency would have the necessary statistics on the economy, as well as the capability of using statistics to direct production. The economy could be represented as a system of equations. Solution values for these equations could be used to price all goods at marginal cost and direct production. Hayek (1935) argued against the proposal to simulate markets with equations. Dickinson (1939) adopted the Lange-Taylor proposal to simulate markets through trial and error. The Lange‚ÄìDickinson version of market socialism kept capital investment out of the market. Lange (1926 p65) insisted that a central planning board would have to set capital accumulation rates arbitrarily. Lange and Dickinson saw potential problems with bureaucratization in market socialism. According to Dickinson, \\"the attempt to check irresponsibility will tie up managers of socialist enterprises with so much red tape and bureaucratic regulation that they will lose all initiative and independence\\" (Dickinson 1938, p. 214). In The Economics of Control: Principles of Welfare Economics (1944), Abba Lerner admitted that capital investment would be politicized in market socialism.  Late 20th century and early 21st century  Economists active in the former Yugoslavia, including Czech-born Jaroslav Vanek and Croat-born Branko Horvat, promoted a model of market socialism dubbed the Illyrian model, where firms were socially owned by their employees and structured on workers' self-management and competed with each other in open and free markets. American economists in the latter half of the 20th century developed models based such as coupon socialism (by the economist John Roemer) and economic democracy (by the philosopher David Schweickart). Pranab Bardhan and John Roemer proposed a form of market socialism where there was a stock market that distributed shares of the capital stock equally among citizens. In this stock market, there is no buying or selling of stocks, which leads to negative externalities associated with a concentration of capital ownership. The Bardhan and Roemer model satisfied the main requirements of both socialism (workers own all the factors of production, not just labour) and market economies (prices determine efficient allocation of resources). New Zealand economist Steven O'Donnell expanded on the Bardhan and Roemer model and decomposed the capital function in a general equilibrium system to take account of entrepreneurial activity in market socialist economies. O'Donnell (2003) set up a model that could be used as a blueprint for transition economies and the results suggested that although market socialist models were inherently unstable in the long term, they would provide in the short term the economic infrastructure necessary for a successful transition from planned to market economies. In the early 21st century, the Marxian economist Richard D. Wolff refocused Marxian economics giving it a microfoundational focus. The core idea was that transition from capitalism to socialism required the reorganization of the enterprise from a top-down hierarchical capitalist model to a model where all key enterprise decisions (what, how, and where to produce and what to do with outputs) were made on a one-worker, one vote basis. Wolff called them workers self-directed enterprises (WSDEs). How they would interact with one another and with consumers was left open to democratic social decisions and could entail markets or planning, or likely mixtures of both. Advocates of market socialism such as Jaroslav Vanek argue that genuinely free markets are not possible under conditions of private ownership of productive property. Instead, he contends that the class differences and inequalities in income and power that result from private ownership enable the interests of the dominant class to skew the market to their favor, either in the form of monopoly and market power, or by utilizing their wealth and resources to legislate government policies that benefit their specific business interests. Additionally, Vanek states that workers in a socialist economy based on cooperative and self-managed enterprises have stronger incentives to maximize productivity because they would receive a share of the profits (based on the overall performance of their enterprise) in addition to receiving their fixed wage or salary. The stronger incentives to maximize productivity that he conceives as possible in a socialist economy based on cooperative and self- managed enterprises might be accomplished in a free-market economy if employee-owned companies were the norm as envisioned by various thinkers including Louis O. Kelso and James S. Albus.\\"Cooperative Economics: An Interview with Jaroslav Vanek\\". Interview by Albert Perkins. Retrieved 17 March 2011. = Anti-equilibrium economics = Another form of market socialism has been promoted by critics of central planning and generally of neoclassical general equilibrium theory. The most notable of these economists were Alec Nove and Janos Kornai. In particular, Alec Nove proposed what he called feasible socialism, a mixed economy consisting of state-run enterprises, autonomous publicly owned firms, cooperatives and small-scale private enterprise operating in a market economy that included a role for macroeconomic planning.\\"Feasible Socialism: Market or Plan ‚Äì Or Both\\".  In practice  A number of market socialist elements have existed in various economies. The economy of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is widely considered to have been a form of market-based socialism, based on socially-owned cooperatives, workers' self-management and market allocation of capital. Some of the economic reforms introduced during the Prague Spring by Alexander Dubƒçek, the leader of Czechoslovakia, included elements of market socialism.Galia Golan (1971). Reform Rule in Czechoslovakia: The Dubcek Era 1968‚Äì1969. Cambridge University Press. . Vietnam's socialist-oriented market economy is self-described as market socialist. It has an extremely high prevalence of cooperatives, especially in agriculture and retail, with the continued state ownership of the commanding heights of the economy.\\"Key role of the state economic sector in Vietnam‚Äôs socialist-oriented market economy undeniable\\".

The Mondragon Corporation in the Basque Country, Coop in Italy and cooperatives in many other countries are widely cited as highly successful co-operative enterprises based on worker- or consumer-ownership and democratic management. Peter Drucker described the United States system of regulated pension funds providing capital to financial markets as \\"pension fund socialism\\".Drucker, Peter Ferdinand (1976).

Policies similar to the market socialist proposal of a social dividend and basic income scheme have been implemented on the basis of public ownership of natural resources in Alaska (Alaska Permanent Fund) and in Norway (the Government Pension Fund of Norway). Belarus under Alexander Lukashenko is sometimes described as market socialist. Ethiopia under Abiy Ahmed has recently been described as market socialist.  Relation to political ideologies  = Marxism‚ÄìLeninism = The phrase market socialism has occasionally been used in reference to any attempt by a Soviet-type planned economy to introduce market elements into its economic system. In this sense, market socialism was first attempted during the 1920s in the Soviet Union as the New Economic Policy (NEP) before being abandoned. Later, elements of market socialism were introduced in Hungary (where it was nicknamed goulash communism), Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia (see Titoism) in the 1970s and 1980s. The contemporary Economy of Belarus has been described as a market socialist system. The Soviet Union attempted to introduce a market system with its perestroika reforms under Mikhail Gorbachev. During the later stages there was talk within top circles that the Soviet Union should move toward a market-based socialist system. Historically, these kinds of market socialist systems attempt to retain state ownership of the commanding heights of the economy such as heavy industry, energy and infrastructure while introducing decentralised decision making and giving local managers more freedom to make decisions and respond to market demands. Market socialist systems also allow private ownership and entrepreneurship in the service and other secondary economic sectors. The market is allowed to determine prices for consumer goods and agricultural products, and farmers are allowed to sell all or some of their products on the open market and keep some or all of the profit as an incentive to increase and improve production. = Socialism with Chinese characteristics = The term market socialism has been used to refer to reformed economic systems in Marxist‚ÄìLeninist states, most notably in reference to the contemporary economy of the People's Republic of China, where a free price system is used for the allocation of capital goods in both the state and private sectors. However, Chinese political and economic proponents of the socialist market economy do not consider it to be a form of market socialism in the neoclassical sense and many Western economists and political scientists question the degree to which this model constitutes a form of market socialism, often preferring to describe it as state capitalism.Market socialism or Capitalism? Evidence from Chinese Financial Market Development, 2005, by Du, Julan and Xu, Chenggang. April 2005. International Economic Association 2005 Round Table on Market and Socialism, April 2005. Although similar in name, market socialism differs markedly from the socialist market economy and socialist-oriented market economy models practiced in the contemporary People's Republic of China and Socialist Republic of Vietnam, respectively. Officially these economic systems represent market economies that are in the long-term process of transition toward socialism. Key differences between models of market socialism and the Chinese and Vietnamese models include the role of private investment in enterprises, the lack of a social dividend or basic income system to equitably distribute state profits among the population and the existence and role of financial markets in the Chinese model‚Äîmarkets which are absent in the market socialist literature. The Chinese experience with socialism with Chinese characteristics is frequently referred to as a socialist market economy where the commanding heights are state-owned, but a substantial portion of both the state and private sectors of economy are governed by market practices, including a stock exchange for trading equity and the utilization of indirect macroeconomic market mechanisms (i.e. fiscal, monetary and industrial policies) to influence the economy in the same manner governments affect the economy in capitalist economies. The market is the arbitrator for most economic activity, with economic planning being relegated to macro-economic government indicative planning that does not encompass the microeconomic decision-making that is left to the individual organizations and state-owned enterprises. This model includes a significant amount of privately owned firms that operate as a business for profit, but only for consumer goods and services.\\"The Role of Planning in China's Market Economy\\" , presented before the \\"International Conference on China's Planning System Reform\\", 24 and 25 March 2004 in Beijing, by Prof. Gregory C. Chow, Princeton University. In the Chinese system, directive planning based on mandatory output requirements and quotas were displaced by market mechanisms for most of the economy, including both the state and private sectors, although the government engages in indicative planning for large state enterprises. In comparison with the Soviet-type planned economy, the Chinese socialist market model is based on the corporatization of state institutions, transforming them into joint-stock companies. As of 2008, there were 150 state-owned corporations directly under the central government. These state-owned corporations have been reformed and become increasingly dynamic and a major source of revenue for the state in 2008,David A. Ralston, Jane Terpstra-Tong, Robert H. Terpstra, Xueli Wang, \\"Today's State-Owned Enterprises of China: Are They Dying Dinosaurs or Dynamic Dynamos?\\" leading the economic recovery in 2009 during the wake of the global financial crises. This economic model is defended from a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist perspective which states that a planned socialist economy can only emerge after first developing the basis for socialism through the establishment of a market economy and commodity-exchange economy; and that socialism would only emerge after this stage has exhausted its historical necessity and gradually transforms itself into socialism. Proponents of this model argue that the economic system of the former Soviet Union and its satellite states attempted to go from a natural economy to a planned economy by decree, without passing through the necessary market economy phase of development.Vuong, Quan-Hoang (February 2010). Financial Markets in Vietnam's Transition Economy: Facts, Insights, Implications. Saarbr√ºcken, Germany: VDM Publishing. . = Democratic socialism = Some democratic socialists advocate forms of market socialism, some of which are based on self-management. Others advocate for a non-market participatory economy based on decentralized economic planning. = Anarchism = Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was the primary proponent of mutualism and influenced many later individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers The French philosopher Pierre Joseph Proudhon is the first person to call himself an anarchist and considered among its most influential theorists. Proudhon is considered by many to be the \\"father of anarchism\\".Daniel Guerin, Anarchism: From Theory to Practice (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970). Proudhon became a member of the French Parliament after the French Revolution of 1848, whereon he referred to himself as a federalist.Binkley, Robert C. Realism and Nationalism 1852-1871. Read Books. p. 118 Proudhon's best-known assertion is that \\"Property is theft!\\", contained in his first major work What Is Property?, published in 1840. The book's publication attracted the attention of the French authorities. It also attracted the scrutiny of Karl Marx, who started a correspondence with Proudhon. The two influenced each other and met in Paris while Marx was exiled there. Their friendship finally ended when Marx responded to Proudhon's The Philosophy of Poverty with the provocatively titled The Poverty of Philosophy. The dispute became one of the sources of the split between the anarchist and Marxist wings of the International Working Men's Association. Mutualism is an anarchist school of thought and market socialist economic theory that advocates a socialist society where each person possess a means of production, either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the free market. Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank that would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate, just high enough to cover administration.Miller, David. 1987. \\"Mutualism.\\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11 Mutualism is based on a labor theory of value which holds that when labor or its product is sold it ought to receive in exhcange goods or services embodying \\"the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility\\".Tandy, Francis D., 1896, Voluntary Socialism, chapter 6, paragraph 15. Mutualism originated from the writings of Proudhon. Mutualists oppose the idea of individuals receiving an income through loans, investments and rent as they believe these individuals are not laboring. Although opposed this type of income, Proudhon expressed that he had never intended \\"to forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I think that all these manifestations of human activity should remain free and voluntary for all: I ask for them no modifications, restrictions or suppressions, other than those which result naturally and of necessity from the universalization of the principle of reciprocity which I propose\\".Proudhon's Solution of the Social Problem, Edited by Henry Cohen. Vanguard Press, 1927. Insofar as they ensure the worker's right to the full product of their labor, mutualists support markets or artificial markets and property in the product of labor. However, mutualists argue for conditional titles to land, whose ownership is legitimate only so long as it remains in use or occupation (which Proudhon called possession),Swartz, Clarence Lee. What is Mutualism? VI. Land and Rent advocating personal property in place of private property.Crowder, George (1991). Classical Anarchism: The Political Thought of Godwin, Proudhon, Bakunin, and Kropotkin. Oxford: Clarendon Press. pp. 85‚Äì86. . \\"The ownership [anarchists oppose] is basically that which is unearned [...] including such things as interest on loans and income from rent. This is contrasted with ownership rights in those goods either produced by the work of the owner or necessary for that work, for example his dwelling-house, land and tools. Proudhon initially refers to legitimate rights of ownership of these goods as 'possession,' and although in his latter work he calls this 'property,' the conceptual distinction remains the same.\\"Hargreaves, David H. London (2019). Beyond Schooling: An Anarchist Challenge. London: Routledge. pp. 90‚Äì91. . \\"Ironically, Proudhon did not mean literally what he said. His boldness of expression was intended for emphasis, and by 'property' he wished to be understood what he later called 'the sum of its abuses'. He was denouncing the property of the man who uses it to exploit the labour of others without any effort on his own part, property distinguished by interest and rent, by the impositions of the non-producer on the producer. Towards property regarded as 'possession' the right of a man to control his dwelling and the land and tools he needs to live, Proudhon had no hostility; indeed, he regarded it as the cornerstone of liberty, and his main criticism of the communists was that they wished to destroy it.\\" However, some individualist anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker started calling possession as property or private property.The Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective. \\"Section G - Is individualist anarchism capitalistic?\\".

Josiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, The Peaceful Revolutionist, was the first anarchist periodical published.William Bailie, Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist ‚Äì A Sociological Study, Boston: Small, Maynard & Co., 1906, p. 20 For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, \\"[i]t is apparent [...] that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews. [...] William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form\\". Later, the American individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker \\"was against both the state and capitalism, against both oppression and exploitation. While not against the market and property he was firmly against capitalism as it was, in his eyes, a state-supported monopoly of social capital (tools, machinery, etc.) which allows owners to exploit their employees, i.e. to avoid paying workers the full value of their labour. He thought that the \\"labouring classes are deprived of their earnings by usury in its three forms, interest, rent and profit\\". Therefore, \\"Liberty will abolish interest; it will abolish profit; it will abolish monopolistic rent; it will abolish taxation; it will abolish the exploitation of labour; it will abolish all means whereby any labourer can be deprived of any of his product\\". This stance puts him squarely in the libertarian socialist tradition and, unsurprisingly, Tucker referred to himself many times as a socialist and considered his philosophy to be \\"[a]narchistic socialism\\".\\"Benjamin Tucker: Capitalist or Anarchist\\" in An Anarchist FAQ by Various Authors\\"The economic principles of Modern Socialism are a logical deduction from the principle laid down by Adam Smith in the early chapters of his \\"Wealth of Nations,\\" ‚Äì namely, that labor is the true measure of price...Half a century or more after Smith enunciated the principle above stated, Socialism picked it up where he had dropped it, and in following it to its logical conclusions, made it the basis of a new economic philosophy...This seems to have been done independently by three different men, of three different nationalities, in three different languages: Josiah Warren, an American; Pierre J. Proudhon, a Frenchman; Karl Marx, a German Jew...That the work of this interesting trio should have been done so nearly simultaneously would seem to indicate that Socialism was in the air, and that the time was ripe and the conditions favorable for the appearance of this new school of thought...So far as priority of time is concerned, the credit seems to belong to Warren, the American, ‚Äì a fact which should be noted by the stump orators who are so fond of declaiming against Socialism as an imported article.\\" Benjamin Tucker. Individual Liberty Benjamin Tucker, American individualist anarchist French individualist anarchist Emile Armand shows clearly opposition to capitalism and centralized economies when he said that the individualist anarchist \\"inwardly he remains refractory ‚Äì fatally refractory ‚Äì morally, intellectually, economically (The capitalist economy and the directed economy, the speculators and the fabricators of single systems are equally repugnant to him.)\\". He argued for a pluralistic economic logic when he said that \\"Here and there everything happening ‚Äì here everyone receiving what they need, there each one getting whatever is needed according to their own capacity. Here, gift and barter ‚Äì one product for another; there, exchange ‚Äì product for representative value. Here, the producer is the owner of the product, there, the product is put to the possession of the collectivity\\".√âmile Armand. Anarchist Individualism and Amorous Comradeship The Spanish individualist anarchist Miguel Gimenez Igualada thought that \\"capitalism is an effect of government; the disappearance of government means capitalism falls from its pedestal vertiginously. [...] That which we call capitalism is not something else but a product of the State, within which the only thing that is being pushed forward is profit, good or badly acquired. And so to fight against capitalism is a pointless task, since be it State capitalism or Enterprise capitalism, as long as Government exists, exploiting capital will exist. The fight, but of consciousness, is against the State\\".\\"el capitalismo es s√≥lo el efecto del gobierno; desaparecido el gobierno, el capitalismo cae de su pedestal vertiginosamente.... Lo que llamamos capitalismo no es otra cosa que el producto del Estado, dentro del cual lo √∫nico que se cultiva es la ganancia, bien o mal habida. Luchar, pues, contra el capitalismo es tarea in√∫til, porque sea Capitalismo de Estado o Capitalismo de Empresa, mientras el Gobierno exista, existir√° el capital que explota. La lucha, pero de conciencias, es contra el Estado.\\"Anarquismo by Miguel Gimenez Igualada His view on class division and technocracy are as follows \\"Since when no one works for another, the profiteer from wealth disappears, just as government will disappear when no one pays attention to those who learned four things at universities and from that fact they pretend to govern men. Big industrial enterprises will be transformed by men in big associations in which everyone will work and enjoy the product of their work. And from those easy as well as beautiful problems anarchism deals with and he who puts them in practice and lives them are anarchists. [...] The priority which without rest an anarchist must make is that in which no one has to exploit anyone, no man to no man, since that non-exploitation will lead to the limitation of property to individual needs\\".\\"¬øLa propiedad? ¬°Bah! No es problema. Porque cuando nadie trabaje para nadie, el acaparador de la riqueza desaparece, como ha de desaparecer el gobierno cuando nadie haga caso a los que aprendieron cuatro cosas en las universidades y por ese s√≥lo hecho pretenden gobernar a los hombres. Porque si en la tierra de los ciegos el tuerto es rey, en donde todos ven y juzgan y disciernen, el rey estorba. Y de lo que se trata es de que no haya reyes porque todos sean hombres. Las grandes empresas industriales las transformar√°n los hombres en grandes asociaciones donde todos trabajen y disfruten del producto de su trabajo. Y de esos tan sencillos como hermosos problemas trata el anarquismo y al que lo cumple y vive es al que se le llama anarquista...El hincapi√© que sin cansancio debe hacer el anarquista es el de que nadie debe explotar a nadie, ning√∫n hombre a ning√∫n hombre, porque esa no- explotaci√≥n llevar√≠a consigo la limitaci√≥n de la propiedad a las necesidades individuales.\\"Anarquismo by Miguel Gimenez Igualada Left-wing market anarchism is a market socialist form of individualist anarchism, left-libertarianism and libertarian socialismChartier, Gary; Johnson, Charles W.

Criticism  Market abolitionists such as David McNally argue in the Marxist tradition that the logic of the market inherently produces inequitable outcomes and leads to unequal exchanges, arguing that Adam Smith's moral intent and moral philosophy espousing equal exchange was undermined by the practice of the free market he championed‚Äîthe development of the market economy involved coercion, exploitation and violence that Smith's moral philosophy could not countenance. McNally criticizes market socialists for believing in the possibility of fair markets based on equal exchanges to be achieved by purging parasitical elements from the market economy such as private ownership of the means of production, arguing that market socialism is an oxymoron when socialism is defined as an end to wage labour.

The band has released three full-length albums via Century Media Records, Gnosis, The Amanuensis and Phronesis in 2012, 2014 and 2018 respectively. History The band was formed by Fellsilent guitarist John Browne and the Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza guitarist Josh Travis in 2007. After various lineup changes, the band signed with Century Media Records in 2012, announcing the addition of singer Matt Rose the same day. Their debut album, Gnosis, came out on 28 August 2012. The band took part in the Euroblast European Tour with Jeff Loomis, Vildhjarta, and Stealing Axion. Another European tour with Born of Osiris and After the Burial followed in early 2013. By March 2013, the band parted ways with vocalist Matt Rose. In July 2013, it was announced that former Periphery and current Ever Forthright and The HAARP Machine vocalist Chris Barretto had joined the band. In December 2013, the band announced via Facebook that they had completed their second album. The drums were recorded in Monnow Valley, Wales with Romesh Dodangoda (Mot√∂rhead, Sylosis, Bring Me The Horizon), while the rest of the instruments were tracked DIY by Browne, and the vocals were done with Eyal Levi. In April 2014, it was formally announced that their new album, The Amanuensis, would be released on 23 June 2014. The band played on the Red Bull Studios Live Stage at Download on Sunday 15 June 2014. In March and April 2015, they supported Australian band Karnivool on their UK and European headline tour. Drummer Mike Malyan left the band during August 2015 due to injuries on his back and shoulder and was replaced by Anup Sastry, the former Intervals drummer. They played at Hevy music festival later that month. On 16 June 2016, Anup Sastry announced on his Facebook page that he was amicably leaving the band, although he returned in 2018 to record drums for the new album, Phronesis. In support of the release of the new album, Monuments performed a 31-date tour of the United Kingdom and mainland Europe over October and November with main support from Vola. In January 2019 Monuments will be performing headline shows in New Zealand, then on the Australian multi-date music festival Progfest. On 1 July 2019 Monuments announced that Chris Barretto had departed the band due to \\"personal reasons.\\" They also announced Andy Cizek as their fill-in vocalist for the rest of the tour. On 11 October 2019 Monuments announced that Andy Cizek is now their official vocalist. Less than two months later, former drummer Mike Malyan rejoined the band.

It is , nearly as long as Shickshinny Creek itself. The creek flows through Briar Creek Township, Columbia County; Salem Township, Luzerne County; and the borough of Shickshinny, in Luzerne County. It is designated as a high-quality coldwater fishery. Pennsylvania State Game Lands #55 and #260 are in the creek's watershed. The watershed has an area of 9.8 square miles, which includes swamps and forests. Waterfalls known as the Little Shickshinny Creek Falls are located on the creek. Course Little Shickshinny Creek near its headwaters Little Shickshinny Creek begins near the northwestern edge of Briar Creek Township, Columbia County, between Knob Mountain and Huntington Mountain. The creek flows east for a few miles, heading down into a valley between the two aforementioned mountains. The valley broadens gradually and the creek eventually exits Briar Creek Township. Upon exiting Briar Creek Township, Little Shickshinny Creek enters Salem Township, Luzerne County. Here, it turns northeast and its valley narrows slightly. After a few more miles, the creek reaches the borough of Shickshinny, where it reaches its confluence with Shickshinny Creek. Little Shickshinny Creek's mouth is upstream of the mouth of Shickshinny Creek. Watershed and geography The watershed of Little Shickshinny Creek has an area of 9.8 square miles. There is a reservoir on Little Shickshinny Creek. There is also a swamp and some minor development. A ridge is located in the vicinity of Little Shickshinny Creek in Columbia County. It is in the State Game Lands #55. Plants inhabiting this area include oaks, birches, laurel, and other species. The land on the northern side of the creek is level and not well-drained. Little Shickshinny Creek flows through a gorge in Pennsylvania State Game Lands #260. There are also waterfalls on the creek here, which are termed the \\"Little Shickshinny Creek Falls\\" by Jeff Mitchell in his book Hiking the Endless Mountains. The waterfalls are high. Sandstone outcroppings appear near the falls. Varved laclustrine sediments may appear on the northern side of the creek. Its valley has experienced glaciation in the past. The mouth of Little Shickshinny Creek has an elevation of above sea level. History and etymology An intake dam was built on Little Shickshinny Creek by the Pennsylvania Game Commission. It was tall, , and was used to supply water. The dam was removed in 2009, resulting in increased water quality. The word shickshinny in Little Shickshinny Creek's name means \\"quick dashing water\\". =Recreation= Recreation in the watershed of Little Shickshinny Creek includes the Pennsylvania State Game Lands #55 and the Camp Louise Girl Scout Camp. The creek also passes through Pennsylvania State Game Lands #260, which has a trail leading to it. A swimming hole is located on Little Shickshinny Creek. Biology Little Shickshinny Creek is designated as a high-quality coldwater fishery. It is home to wild trout and is not stocked. The creek's upper reaches are in the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 55. Habitats along Little Shickshinny Creek include mainly a Hemlock Palustrine Forest Natural Community, but also a red maple swamp, a highbush blueberry shrub swamp, and a dry oak-heath forest. Tree species in the creek's Hemlock Palustrine Forest Natural Community include mainly eastern hemlock, but also black gum, white pine, and beech. Other plants found here include Jack-in-the-pulpit, rhododendron, sensitive fern, skunk cabbage, hay- scented fern, and mountain laurel. The creek's shrub swamps and red maple swamps are home to gray birch, sedge, royal fern, silky dogwood, and numerous others. Trees found directly on Little Shickshinny Creek and its tributaries include hemlock, black gum, and yellow birch. Other plants found on the banks of the creek include Canada mayflower, rhododendron, cinnamon fern, royal fern, starflower, dwarf ginseng, skunk cabbage, pink lady‚Äôs-slipper, and partridge berry. Little Shickshinny Creek and the surrounding area has a high level of bird biodiversity, which has been described as \\"exceptional for the area\\". There are 33 bird species near the creek, including owls, thrushes, flycatchers, and ten warbler species. The creek's headwaters have a high level of plant biodiversity.

Those who favor socialism generally speak of social ownership, social control, or socialization of the means of production as the distinctive positive feature of a socialist economic system.\\" that may take the form of autonomous cooperatives or direct public ownership wherein production is carried out directly for use rather than for profit.Arneson, Richard J.

Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists. New York; London: Routledge. pp. 61‚Äì63. . \\"More fundamentally, a socialist society must be one in which the economy is run on the principle of the direct satisfaction of human needs. [...] Exchange-value, prices and so money are goals in themselves in a capitalist society or in any market. There is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital or sums of money and human welfare. Under conditions of backwardness, the spur of money and the accumulation of wealth has led to a massive growth in industry and technology. [...] It seems an odd argument to say that a capitalist will only be efficient in producing use- value of a good quality when trying to make more money than the next capitalist. It would seem easier to rely on the planning of use-values in a rational way, which because there is no duplication, would be produced more cheaply and be of a higher quality. [...] Although money, and so monetary calculation, will disappear in socialism this does not mean that there will no longer be any need to make choices, evaluations and calculations. [...] Wealth will be produced and distributed in its natural form of useful things, of objects that can serve to satisfy some human need or other. Not being produced for sale on a market, items of wealth will not acquire an exchange-value in addition to their use-value. In socialism their value, in the normal non- economic sense of the word, will not be their selling price nor the time needed to produce them but their usefulness. It is for this that they will be appreciated, evaluated, wanted and produced.\\"\\" Socialist systems that utilize markets for allocating capital goods and factors of production among economic units are designated market socialism. When planning is utilized, the economic system is designated as a socialist planned economy. Non-market forms of socialism usually include a system of accounting based on calculation-in-kind to value resources and goods.Lawler, James; Ollman, Bertell; Schweickart, David; Ticktin, Hillel (1998). \\"The Difference Between Marxism and Market Socialism\\". Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists. New York; London: Routledge. pp. 60‚Äì64. . Socialist economics has been associated with different schools of economic thought. Marxian economics provided a foundation for socialism based on analysis of capitalism while neoclassical economics and evolutionary economics provided comprehensive models of socialism. During the 20th century, proposals and models for both socialist planned and market economies were based heavily on neoclassical economics or a synthesis of neoclassical economics with Marxian or institutional economics.Enrico Barone, \\"Il Ministro della Produzione nello Stato Collettivista\\", Giornale degli Economisti, 2, pp. 267‚Äì93, trans. as \\"The Ministry of Production in the Collectivist State\\", in F.

In Carrier, James G., ed. Meanings of the Market: The Free Market in Western Culture. Berg Publishers. p. 107. .  History of socialist economic thought  Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels believed that hunter-gatherer societies and some primitive agricultural societies were communal, and called this primitive communism. Engels wrote about this at length in the book The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, which was based on the unpublished notes of Marx on the work of Lewis Henry Morgan. Values of socialism have roots in pre-capitalist institutions such as the religious communes, reciprocal obligations and communal charity of medieval Europe, the development of its economic theory primarily reflects and responds to the monumental changes brought about by the dissolution of feudalism and the emergence of specifically capitalist social relations.Wallerstein, Immanuel Historical Capitalism As such it is commonly regarded as a movement belonging to the modern era. Many socialists have considered their advocacy as the preservation and extension of the radical humanist ideas expressed in Enlightenment doctrine such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality, Wilhelm von Humboldt's Limits of State Action, or Immanuel Kant's insistent defense of the French Revolution.Chomsky, Noam Perspectives on Power Capitalism appeared in mature form as a result of the problems raised when an industrial factory system requiring long-term investment and entailing corresponding risks was introduced into an internationalized commercial (mercantilist) framework. Historically speaking, the most pressing needs of this new system were an assured supply of the elements of industry (land, elaborate machinery, and labour) and these imperatives led to the commodification of these elements.Karl Polanyi Primitive, Archaic and Modern Economies. According to influential socialist economic historian Karl Polanyi's classic account, the forceful transformation of land, money and especially labour into commodities to be allocated by an autonomous market mechanism was an alien and inhuman rupture of the pre- existing social fabric. Marx had viewed the process in a similar light, referring to it as part of the process of \\"primitive accumulation\\" whereby enough initial capital is amassed to begin capitalist production. The dislocation that Polyani and others describe, triggered natural counter- movements in efforts to re-embed the economy in society. These counter- movements, that included, for example, the Luddite rebellions, are the incipient socialist movements. Over time such movements gave birth to or acquired an array of intellectual defenders who attempted to develop their ideas in theory. As Polanyi noted, these counter-movements were mostly reactive and therefore not full-fledged socialist movements. Some demands went no further than a wish to mitigate the capitalist market's worst effects. Later, a full socialist program developed, arguing for systemic transformation. Its theorists believed that even if markets and private property could be tamed so as not to be excessively \\"exploitative\\", or crises could be effectively mitigated, capitalist social relations would remain significantly unjust and anti-democratic, suppressing universal human needs for fulfilling, empowering and creative work, diversity and solidarity. Within this context, socialism has undergone four periods: the first in the 19th century was a period of utopian visions (1780s‚Äì1850s); then occurred the rise of revolutionary socialist and communist movements in the 19th century as the primary opposition to the rise of corporations and industrialization (1830‚Äì1916); the polarisation of socialism around the question of the Soviet Union and adoption of socialist or social democratic policies in response (1916‚Äì1989); and the response of socialism in the neoliberal era (1970s‚Äìpresent). As socialism developed, so did the socialist system of economics. = Utopian socialism = The first theories which came to hold the term \\"socialism\\" began to be formulated in the late 18th century and were termed \\"socialism\\" early in the 19th century. The central beliefs of the socialism of this period rested on the exploitation of those who labored by those who owned capital or rented land and housing. The abject misery, poverty and disease to which laboring classes seemed destined was the inspiration for a series of schools of thought which argued that life under a class of masters or \\"capitalists\\", as they were then becoming to be called, would consist of working classes being driven down to subsistence wages (see the iron law of wages). Socialist ideas found expression in utopian movements, which often formed agricultural communes aimed at being self-sufficient on the land. These included many religious movements, such as the Christian socialism of the Shakers in America and the Hutterites. The Zionist kibbutzim and communes of the counterculture are also manifestations of utopian socialist ideas. Utopian socialism had little to offer in terms of a systematic theory of economic phenomena. In theory, economic problems were dissolved by a utopian society which had transcended material scarcity. In practice, small communities with a common spirit could sometimes resolve allocation problems. = Socialism and classical political economy = The first organized theories of socialist economics were significantly impacted by classical economic theory, including elements in Adam Smith, Robert Malthus and David Ricardo. In Smith there is a conception of a common good not provided by the market, a class analysis, a concern for the dehumanizing aspects of the factory system, and the concept of rent as being unproductive. Ricardo argued that the renting class was parasitic. This, and the possibility of a \\"general glut\\", an over accumulation of capital to produce goods for sale rather than for use, became the foundation of a rising critique of the concept that free markets with competition would be sufficient to prevent disastrous downturns in the economy, and whether the need for expansion would inevitably lead to war. = Socialist political economy before Marx = Charles Fourier, influential early French socialist thinker A key early socialist theorist of political economy was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. He was the most well-known of nineteenth century mutualist theorists and the first thinker to refer to himself as an anarchist. Others were: Technocrats like Henri de Saint-Simon, agrarian radicals like Thomas Spence, William Ogilvie and William Cobbett; anti-capitalists like Thomas Hodgskin; communitarian and utopian socialists like Robert Owen, William Thompson and Charles Fourier; anti-market socialists like John Gray and John Francis Bray; the Christian mutualist William Batchelder Greene; as well as the theorists of the Chartist movement and early proponents of syndicalism.Noel Thomson The Real Rights of Man: Political Economies for the Working Class 1775‚Äì1850, 1998, Pluto Press The first advocates of socialism promoted social leveling in order to create a meritocratic or technocratic society based upon individual talent. Count Henri de Saint-Simon was the first individual to coin the term \\"socialism\\". Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology, which led him to advocate a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of capitalism and which would be based upon equal opportunities. Saint-Simon advocated a society in which each person was ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work. This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organized economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific and material progress, which embodied a desire for a semi-planned economy. Other early socialist thinkers were influenced by the classical economists. The Ricardian socialists, such as Thomas Hodgskin and Charles Hall, were based on the work of David Ricardo and reasoned that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated producer prices when those commodities were in elastic supply, and that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labor. The Ricardian socialists viewed profit, interest and rent as deductions from this exchange-value. = Karl Marx and Das Kapital = Karl Marx, influential German socialist thinker and economist Karl Marx employed systematic analysis in an attempt to elucidate capitalism's contradictory laws of motion, as well as to expose the specific mechanisms by which it exploits and alienates. He radically modified classical political economic theories. Marx transformed the labor theory of value, which had been worked upon by Adam Smith and David Ricardo, into his \\"law of value\\", and used it for the purpose of revealing how commodity fetishism obscures the reality of capitalist society. His approach, which Friedrich Engels would call \\"scientific socialism\\", would stand as the branching point in economic theory. In one direction went those who rejected the capitalist system as fundamentally anti-social, arguing that it could never be harnessed to effectively realize the fullest development of human potentialities wherein \\"the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all\\". Marx's Das Kapital is an incomplete work of economic theory; he had planned four volumes but completed two and left his collaborator Engels to complete the third. In many ways, the work is modelled on Smith's Wealth of Nations, seeking to be a comprehensive logical description of production, consumption, and finance in relation to morality and the state. The work of philosophy, anthropology, sociology, and economics includes the following topics: * Law of value: capitalist production is the production of \\"an immense multitude of commodities\\" or generalised commodity production. A commodity has two essential qualities firstly, they are useful, they satisfy some human want, \\"the nature of such wants, whether, for instance, they spring from the stomach or from fancy, makes no difference\\" and secondly they are sold on a market or exchanged. Critically the exchange value of a commodity \\"is independent of the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful qualities\\". However, rather depends on the amount of socially necessary labour required to produce it. All commodities are sold at their value, so the origin of the capitalist profit is not in cheating or theft, but in the fact that the cost of reproduction of labour power, or the worker's wage, is less than the value created during their time at work, enabling the capitalists to yield a surplus value or profit on their investments. * Historical property relations: historical capitalism represents a process of momentous social upheaval where rural masses were separated from the land and ownership of the means of production by force, deprivation, and legal manipulation, creating an urban proletariat based on the institution of wage-labour. Moreover, capitalist property relations aggravated the artificial separation between city and country, which is a key factor in accounting for the metabolic rift between human beings in capitalism and their natural environment, which is at the root of our current ecological dilemmas. * Commodity fetishism: Marx adapted previous value-theory to show that in capitalism phenomena involved with the price system (markets, competition, supply and demand) constitute a powerful ideology that obscures the underlying social relations of capitalist society. \\"Commodity fetishism\\" refers to this distortion of appearance. The underlying social reality is one of economic exploitation. * Economic exploitation: workers are the fundamental creative source of new value. Property relations affording the right of usufruct and despotic control of the workplace to capitalists are the devices by which the surplus value created by workers is appropriated by the capitalists. * Capital accumulation: inherent to capitalism is the incessant drive to accumulate as a response to the competitive forces acting upon all capitalists. In such a context the accumulated wealth which is the source of the capitalist's social power derives itself from being able to repeat the circuit of Money‚ÜíCommodity‚ÜíMoney, where the capitalist receives an increment or \\"surplus value\\" higher than their initial investment, as rapidly and efficiently as possible. Moreover, this driving imperative leads capitalism to its expansion on a worldwide scale. * Crises: Marx identified natural and historically specific (i.e. structural) barriers to accumulation that were interrelated and interpenetrated one another in times of crises. Different types of crises, such as realization crises and overproduction crises, are expressions of capitalism's inability to constructively overcome such barriers. Moreover, the upshot of crises is increased centralization, the expropriation of the many capitalists by the few. * Centralization: the interacting forces of competition, endemic crises, intensive and extensive expansion of the scale of production, and a growing interdependency with the state apparatus, all promote a strong developmental tendency towards the centralization of capital. * Material development: as a result of its constant drive to optimize profitability by increasing the productivity of labour, typically by revolutionizing technology and production techniques, capitalism develops so as to progressively reduce the objective need for work, suggesting the potential for a new era of creative forms of work and expanded scope for leisure. * Socialization and the pre-conditions for social revolution: by socializing the labour process, concentrating workers into urban settings in large-scale production processes and linking them in a worldwide market, the agents of a potential revolutionary change are created. Thus Marx felt that in the course of its development capitalism was at the same time developing the preconditions for its own negation. However, although the objective conditions for change are generated by the capitalist system itself, the subjective conditions for social revolution can only come about through the apprehension of the objective circumstances by the agents themselves and the transformation of such understanding into an effective revolutionary program.Petras, James and Veltmeyer, Henry Globalization Unmasked: Imperialism in the 21st Century = Anarchist economics = Anarchist economics is the set of theories and practices of economics and economic activity within the political philosophy of anarchism. Pierre Joseph Proudhon was involved with the Lyons mutualists and later adopted the name to describe his own teachings.Woodcock, George. Anarchism: A History Of Libertarian Ideas And Movements. Broadview Press. p. 100 Mutualism is an anarchist school of thought that originates in the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a means of production, either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the free market. Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank that would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate, just high enough to cover administration.Miller, David. 1987. \\"Mutualism.\\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11 Mutualism is based on a labor theory of value that holds that when labor or its product is sold, in exchange, it ought to receive goods or services embodying \\"the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility\\".Tandy, Francis D., 1896, Voluntary Socialism, chapter 6, paragraph 15. Receiving anything less would be considered exploitation, theft of labor, or usury.

Marx in Context. iUniverse. p. 54 doctrine that advocates the abolition of the state and private ownership of the means of production. Instead, it envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves. Once collectivization takes place, workers' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.Bakunin Mikail. Bakunin on Anarchism. Black Rose Books. 1980. p. 369 Collectivist anarchism is most commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin, the anti-authoritarian sections of the First International, and the early Spanish anarchist movement. Anarcho-communism is a theory of anarchism which advocates the abolition of the state, private property, and capitalism in favor of common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations, and workers' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: \\"from each according to ability, to each according to need\\". Unlike mutualism, collectivist anarchism and Marxism, anarcho-communism as defended by Peter Kropotkin and Errico Malatesta rejected the labor theory of value altogether, instead advocating a gift economy and to base distribution on need. As a coherent, modern economic- political philosophy, anarcho-communism was first formulated in the Italian section of the First International by Carlo Cafiero, Emilio Covelli, Errico Malatesta, Andrea Costa, and other ex-Mazzinian Republicans.Nunzio Pernicone, \\"Italian Anarchism 1864‚Äì1892\\", pp. 111‚Äì13, AK Press 2009. Out of respect for Mikhail Bakunin, they did not make their differences with collectivist anarchism explicit until after Bakunin's death.James Guillaume, \\"Michael Bakunin ‚Äì A Biographical Sketch\\" By the early 1880s, most of the European anarchist movement had adopted an anarcho-communist position, advocating the abolition of wage labour and distribution according to need. Ironically, the \\"collectivist\\" label then became more commonly associated with Marxist state socialists who advocated the retention of some sort of wage system during the transition to full communism. Left-wing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, while maintaining that, taken to their logical conclusions, these ideas support strongly anti- corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labor positions and anti-capitalism in economics and anti-imperialism in foreign policy.Gary Chartier and Charles W. Johnson (eds). Markets Not Capitalism: Individualist Anarchism Against Bosses, Inequality, Corporate Power, and Structural Poverty. Minor Compositions; 1st edition (5 November 2011)Gary Chartier has joined Kevin Carson, Charles Johnson, and others (echoing the language of Benjamin Tucker and Thomas Hodgskin) in maintaining that, because of its heritage and its emancipatory goals and potential, radical market anarchism should be seen‚Äîby its proponents and by others‚Äîas part of the socialist tradition, and that market anarchists can and should call themselves \\"socialists.\\" See Gary Chartier, \\"Advocates of Freed Markets Should Oppose Capitalism,\\" \\"Free-Market Anti-Capitalism?\\" session, annual conference, Association of Private Enterprise Education (C√¶sar's Palace, Las Vegas, NV, 13 April 2010); Gary Chartier, \\"Advocates of Freed Markets Should Embrace 'Anti-Capitalism'\\"; Gary Chartier, Socialist Ends, Market Means: Five Essays.

And markets, properly understood, have always been about cooperation. As a commenter at Reason magazine's Hit&Run; blog, remarking on Jesse Walker's link to the Kelly article, put it: \\"every trade is a cooperative act.\\" In fact, it's a fairly common observation among market anarchists that genuinely free markets have the most legitimate claim to the label 'socialism.'\\".\\"Socialism: A Perfectly Good Word Rehabilitated\\" by Kevin Carson at website of Center for a Stateless Society = After Marx = Non-revolutionary socialists were inspired by the writings of John Stuart Mill, and later John Maynard Keynes and the Keynesians, who provided theoretical justification for state involvement in existing market economies. According to the Keynesians, if business cycles could be smoothed out by national ownership of key industries and state direction of their investment, class antagonism would be effectively tamed.They argue that a compact would form between labour and the capitalist class and that there would be no need for revolution. Joan Robinson and Michael Kalecki formed the basis of a critical post-Keynesian economics that at times went well beyond liberal reformism. Marxist economists developed different tendencies based on conflicting interpretations of Marx's ideas, such as the 'Law of Value' and crisis theory. The monopoly capitalist school saw Paul A. Baran and Paul Sweezy attempt to modify Marx's theory of capitalist development‚Äîwhich was based upon the assumption of price competition‚Äîto reflect evolution to a stage where both economy and state were subject to the dominating influence of giant corporations. World-systems analysis restated Marx's ideas about the worldwide division of labour and the drive to accumulate from the holistic perspective of capitalism's historical development as a global system. In 1979, Immanuel Wallerstein wrote: > There are today no socialist systems in the world-economy any more than > there are feudal systems because there is only one world-system. It is a > world-economy and it is by definition capitalist in form.

He found that the net product or surplus in the sphere of production was determined by the balance of bargaining power between workers and capitalists, which was subject to the influence of non-economic, presumably social and political, factors. The mutualist tendency associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon also continued, influencing the development of libertarian socialism, anarchist communism, syndicalism and distributivism.  Characteristics  A socialist economy is a system of production where goods and services are produced directly for use, in contrast to a capitalist economic system, where goods and services are produced to generate profit (and therefore indirectly for use). \\"Production under socialism would be directly and solely for use. With the natural and technical resources of the world held in common and controlled democratically, the sole object of production would be to meet human needs.\\" Goods and services would be produced for their usefulness, or for their use-value, eliminating the need for market-induced needs to ensure a sufficient amount of demand for products to be sold at a profit. Production in a socialist economy is therefore \\"planned\\" or \\"coordinated\\", and does not suffer from the business cycle inherent to capitalism. In most socialist theories, economic planning only applies to the factors of production and not to the allocation of goods and services produced for consumption, which would be distributed through a market. Karl Marx stated that \\"lower-stage communism\\" would consist of compensation based on the amount of labor one contributes to the social product.Karl Marx ‚Äì Critique of the Gotha Programme. 1875 Full Text. Part 1: \\"Here, obviously, the same principle prevails as that which regulates the exchange of commodities, as far as this is exchange of equal values. Content and form are changed, because under the altered circumstances no one can give anything except his labor, and because, on the other hand, nothing can pass to the ownership of individuals, except individual means of consumption. But as far as the distribution of the latter among the individual producers is concerned, the same principle prevails as in the exchange of commodity equivalents: a given amount of labor in one form is exchanged for an equal amount of labor in another form.\\" The ownership of the means of production varies in different socialist theories. It can either be based on public ownership by a state apparatus; direct ownership by the users of the productive property through worker cooperative; or commonly owned by all of society with management and control delegated to those who operate/use the means of production. Management and control over the activities of enterprises is based on self-management and self-governance, with equal power- relations in the workplace to maximize occupational autonomy. A socialist form of organization would eliminate controlling hierarchies so that only a hierarchy based on technical knowledge in the workplace remains. Every member would have decision-making power in the firm and would be able to participate in establishing its overall policy objectives. The policies/goals would be carried out by the technical specialists that form the coordinating hierarchy of the firm, who would establish plans or directives for the work community to accomplish these goals.The Political Economy of Socialism, by Horvat, Branko. 1982. (p. 197): \\"The sandglass (socialist) model is based on the observation that there are two fundamentally different spheres of activity or decision making. The first is concerned with value judgments, and consequently each individual counts as one in this sphere. In the second, technical decisions are made on the basis of technical competence and expertise. The decisions of the first sphere are policy directives; those of the second, technical directives. The former are based on political authority as exercised by all members of the organization; the latter, on professional authority specific to each member and growing out of the division of labor. Such an organization involves a clearly defined coordinating hierarchy but eliminates a power hierarchy.\\" However, the economies of the former Socialist states, excluding Yugoslavia, were based on bureaucratic, top-down administration of economic directives and micromanagement of the worker in the workplace inspired by capitalist models of scientific management. As a result, some socialist movements have argued that said economies were not socialist due to the lack of equal power-relations in the workplace, the presence of a new \\"elite\\", and because of the commodity production that took place in these economies. These economic and social systems have been classified as being either \\"bureaucratic collectivist\\", \\"state capitalist\\" or \\"deformed workers' states\\" by its critics. The exact nature of the USSR et al. remains unresolved within said socialist movements. However, other socialist movements defend the systems that were in place in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, remembering, as said above, that public ownership of the means of production can signify many variants. In the case of the Soviet Union and its satellites, it was the State which controlled and managed almost all of the economy as a single huge enterprise. Furthermore, the products that were manufactured in Soviet-type economies were not produced directly for use, given the fact that all of them were sold to the public at below-market prices (i.e. they were sold in deficit to satisfy the needs of the population). In the May 1949 issue of the Monthly Review titled \\"Why Socialism?\\", Albert Einstein wrote: > I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate (the) grave evils (of > capitalism), namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, > accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social > goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society > itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which > adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work > to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to > every man, woman, and child. The education of the individual, in addition to > promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense > of responsibility for his fellow-men in place of the glorification of power > and success in our present society.Einstein, Albert (May 1949). \\"Why > Socialism?\\", Monthly Review. = Economic planning = Economic planning is a mechanism for the allocation of economic inputs and decision-making based on direct allocation, in contrast to the market mechanism, which is based on indirect allocation.In Defense of Socialist Planning, by Mandel, Ernest. 1986. From New Left Review. \\"Planning is not equivalent to 'perfect' allocation of resources, nor 'scientific' allocation, nor even 'more humane' allocation. It simply means 'direct' allocation, ex ante. As such, it is the opposite of market allocation, which is ex post.\\" An economy based on economic planning appropriates its resources as needed, so that allocation comes in the form of internal transfers rather than market transactions involving the purchasing of assets by one government agency or firm by another. Decision-making is carried out by workers and consumers on the enterprise-level. Economic planning is not synonymous with the concept of a command economy, which existed in the Soviet Union, and was based on a highly bureaucratic administration of the entire economy in accordance to a comprehensive plan formulated by a central planning agency, which specified output requirements for productive units and tried to micromanage the decisions and policies of enterprises. The command economy is based on the organizational model of a capitalist firm, but applies it to the entire economy. Various advocates of economic planning have been staunch critics of command economies and centralized planning. For example, Leon Trotsky believed that central planners, regardless of their intellectual capacity, operated without the input and participation of the millions of people who participate in the economy and understand the local conditions and rapid changes in the economy. Therefore, central planners would be unable to effectively coordinate all economic activity because they lacked this informal information.Writings 1932‚Äì33, P.96, Leon Trotsky. Economic planning in socialism takes a different form than economic planning in capitalist mixed economies (such as dirigisme, central banking and indicative planning); in the former case planning refers to production of use-value directly (planning of production), while in the latter case planning refers to the planning of capital accumulation in order to stabilize or increase the efficiency of this process. = Anti-capitalism = The goal of socialist economics is to neutralize capital, or in the case of market socialism to subject investment and capital to social planning, to coordinate the production of goods and services to directly satisfy demand (as opposed to market-induced needs) and to eliminate the business cycle and crises of overproduction that occur as a result of an economy based on capital accumulation and private property in the means of production. Socialists generally aim to achieve greater equality in decision-making and economic affairs, grant workers greater control of the means of production and their workplace and to eliminate exploitation by directing the surplus value to employees. Free access to the means of subsistence is a requisite for liberty because it ensures that all work is voluntary and no class or individual has the power to coerce others into performing alienating work. The ultimate goal for Marxist socialists is the emancipation of labor from alienating work and therefore freedom from having to perform such labor to receive access to the material necessities for life. It is argued that freedom from necessity would maximize individual liberty as individuals would be able to pursue their own interests and develop their own talents without being coerced into performing labor for others (the power- elite or ruling class in this case) via mechanisms of social control such as the labor market and the state. The stage of economic development in which this is possible is contingent upon advances in the productive capabilities of society. This advanced stage of social relations and economic organization is called pure communism. = Economic value theories = Socialist economic theories base the value of a good or service on its use value, rather than its cost of production (labor theory of value) or its exchange value (marginal utility). Other socialist theories, such as mutualism and market socialism, attempt to apply the labor theory of value to socialism, so that the price of a good or service is adjusted to equal the amount of labor time expended in its production. The labor-time expended by each worker would correspond to labor credits, which would be used as a currency to acquire goods and services. Market socialists that base their models on neoclassical economics, and thus marginal utility, such as Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner, have proposed that publicly owned enterprises set their price to equal marginal cost, thereby achieving pareto efficiency. Anarcho-communism as defended by Peter Kropotkin and Errico Malatesta rejected the labor theory of value and exchange value itself, advocated a gift economy and to base distribution on need.\\"Communism is based on free consumption of all while collectivism is more likely to be based on the distribution of goods according to the labour contributed. An Anarchist FAQ  Economic models and systems  Robin Hahnel and Michael Albert identify five different economic models within socialist economics:Robin Hahnel and Michael Albert A Quiet Revolution in Welfare Economics * Public enterprise centrally planned economy in which all property is owned by the state and all key economic decisions are made centrally by the state, e.g. the former Soviet Union. * Public enterprise state-managed market economy, one form of market socialism which attempts to use the price mechanism to increase economic efficiency while all decisive productive assets remain in the ownership of the state, e.g. the socialist market economy in China and the socialist-oriented market economy in Vietnam after reforms. * A mixed economy, where public and private ownership are mixed and industrial planning is ultimately subordinate to market allocation, e.g. the model generally adopted by social democrats in the 20th century such as in Sweden. Many different proposals for socialist economic systems call for a type of mixed economy, where multiple forms of ownership over the means of production co-exist with one another. Alternatively, a mixed economy may also be a socialist economy that allows a substantial role for private enterprise and contracting within a dominant economic framework of public ownership. This can extend to Soviet-type planned economies that have been reformed to incorporate a greater role for markets in the allocation of factors of production. * Public enterprise employee managed market economies, another form of market socialism in which publicly owned, employee-managed production units engage in free-market exchanges of goods and services with one another as well as with final consumers, e.g. mid-20th-century Yugoslavia. Two more theoretical models are Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar's Progressive Utilization Theory and economic democracy. * Public enterprise participatory planning, an economy featuring social ownership of the means of production with allocation based on an integration of decentralized democratic planning, e.g. stateless communism and libertarian socialism. An incipient historical forebear is that of Catalonia during the Spanish Revolution. More developed theoretical models include those of Karl Polanyi, participatory economics, Inclusive Democracy and the negotiated coordination model of Pat Devine as well as in Cornelius Castoriadis's pamphlet \\"Workers' Councils and the Economics of a Self-Managed Society\\". J√°nos Kornai identifies five distinct types of socialism: * Classical and Marxist conception, where socialism is a stage of economic development in which wage labour, private property in the means of production and monetary relations have been made redundant through the development of the productive forces, so that capital accumulation has been superseded by economic planning. Economic planning in this definition means conscious allocation of economic inputs and the means of production by the associated producers to directly maximise use-values as opposed to exchange-values, in contrast to the \\"anarchy of production\\" of capitalism. * Walrasian and market socialist which defines socialism as public-ownership or cooperative- enterprises in a market economy, with prices for producer goods set through a trial-and-error method by a central planning board. In this view, socialism is defined in terms of de jure public property rights over major enterprises. * Marxist‚ÄìLeninist conception which includes a form of political organisation based on control of the means of production and government by a single political party apparatus that claims to act in the interest of the working class and an ideology hostile toward markets and political dissent, with coordination of economic activity through centralised economic planning, e.g. a command economy in the form of an administrative-command system. * Social- democratic concept based on the capitalist mode of production which defines socialism as a set of values rather than a specific type of social and economic organisation. It includes unconditional support for parliamentary democracy, gradual and reformist attempts to establish socialism and support for socially progressive causes. Social democrats are not opposed to the market or private property and instead they try to ameliorate the effects of capitalism through a welfare state which relies on the market as the fundamental coordinating entity in the economy and a degree of public ownership/public provision of public goods in an economy otherwise dominated by private enterprise. * East Asian model, or socialist market economy, based on a largely free-market, capital accumulation for profit and substantial private ownership along with state-ownership of strategic industries monopolised by a single political party. J√°nos Kornai ultimately leaves the classification of this model (as either socialist or capitalist) to the reader. Socialism can be divided into market socialism and planned socialism based on their dominant mechanism of resource allocation. Another distinction can be made between the type of property structures of different socialist systems (public, cooperative or common) and on the dominant form of economic management within the economy (hierarchical or self-managed). = Economic democracy = Economic democracy is a model of market socialism primarily developed by the American economist David Schweickart. In Schweickart's model, enterprises and natural resources are owned by society in the form of public banking, and management is elected by the workers within each firm. Profits would be distributed among the workers of the respective enterprise. = Lange‚ÄìLerner model = The Lange‚ÄìLerner model involves public ownership of the means of production and the utilization of a trial-and-error approach to achieving equilibrium prices by a central planning board. The Central Planning Board would be responsible for setting prices through a trial-and-error approach to establish equilibrium prices, effectively acting as the abstract Walrasian auctioneer in Walrasian economics. Managers of the state-owned firms would be instructed to set prices to equal marginal cost (P=MC), so that economic equilibrium and Pareto efficiency would be achieved. The Lange model was expanded upon by the American economist Abba Lerner and became known as the Lange‚ÄìLerner theorem, particularly the role of the social dividend. Forerunners of the Lange model include the neoclassical economists Enrico Barone and Fred M. Taylor. = Self-managed economy = The self-managed economy is a form of socialism where enterprises are owned and managed by their employees, effectively negating the employer-employee (or wage labor) dynamic of capitalism and emphasizing the opposition to alienation, self- managing and cooperative aspect of socialism. Members of cooperative firms are relatively free to manage their own affairs and work schedules. This model was developed most extensively by the Yugoslav economists Branko Horvat, Jaroslav Vanek and the American economist Benjamin Ward. = Worker self-directed enterprise = Worker self-directed enterprise is a recent proposal advocated by the American Marxian economist Richard D. Wolff. This model shares many similarities with the model of socialist self-management in that employees own and direct their enterprises, but places a greater role on democratically elected management within a market economy. = Democratic planned socialism = Democratic planned socialism is a form of decentralized planned economy. = Feasible socialism = Feasible socialism was the name Alec Nove gave his outline for socialism in his work The Economics of Feasible Socialism. According to Nove, this model of socialism is \\"feasible\\" because it can be realized within the lifetime of anyone living today. It involves a combination of publicly owned and centrally directed enterprises for large-scale industries, autonomous publicly owned enterprises, consumer and worker-owned cooperatives for the majority of the economy, and private ownership for small businesses. It is a market-based mixed economy that includes a substantial role for macroeconomic interventionism and indicative economic planning. = Pragmatic market socialism = The American economist James Yunker detailed a model where social ownership of the means of production is achieved the same way private ownership is achieved in modern capitalism through the shareholder system that separates management functions from ownership. Yunker posits that social ownership can be achieved by having a public body, designated the Bureau of Public Ownership (BPO), owning the shares of publicly listed firms without affecting market-based allocation of capital inputs. Yunker termed this model pragmatic market socialism because it does not require massive changes to society and would leave the existing management system intact, and would be at least as efficient as modern-day capitalism while providing superior social outcomes as public ownership of large and established enterprises would enable profits to be distributed among the entire population in a social dividend rather than going largely to a class of inheriting rentiers. = Participatory economy = Participatory economics utilizes participatory decision making as an economic mechanism to guide the production, consumption and allocation of resources in a given society. = Computer-managed allocation = Proposals for utilizing computer-based coordination and information technology for the coordination and optimization of resource allocation (also known as cybernetics) within an economy have been outlined by various socialists, economists and computer scientists, including Oskar Lange, the Soviet engineer Viktor Glushkov, and more recently Paul Cockshott and Allin Cottrell. = Peer-to-peer economy and open source = The \\"networked information age\\" has enabled the development and emergence of new forms of organizing the production of value in non-market arrangements that have been termed commons-based peer production along with the negation of ownership and the concept of property in the development of software in the form of open source and open design. = Negotiated coordination = Economist Pat Devine has created a model of coordination called \\"negotiated coordination\\", which is based upon social ownership by those affected by the use of the assets involved, with decisions made by those at the most localised level of production.  Elements of socialism in practice  Although a number of economic systems have existed with various socialist attributes, or have been deemed socialist by their proponents, almost all of the economic systems listed below have largely retained elements of capitalism such as wage labor, the accumulation of capital, and commodity production. Nonetheless, various elements of a socialist economy have been implemented or experimented with in various economies throughout history. Various forms of socialist organizational attributes have existed as minor modes of production within the context of a capitalist economy throughout history‚Äîexamples of this include cooperative enterprises in a capitalist economy, and the emerging free- software movement based on social peer-to-peer production. = Centrally planned economies = A centrally planned economy combines public ownership of the means of production with centralized state planning. This model is usually associated with the Soviet-type command economy. In a centrally planned economy, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a planning agency. In the early years of Soviet central planning, the planning process was based upon a selected number of physical flows with inputs mobilized to meet explicit production targets measured in natural or technical units. This material balances method of achieving plan coherence was later complemented and replaced by value planning, with money provided to enterprises so that they could recruit labour and procure materials and intermediate production goods and services. The Soviet economy was brought to balance by the interlocking of three sets of calculation, namely the setting up of a model incorporating balances of production, manpower and finance. The exercise was undertaken annually and involved a process of iteration (the \\"method of successive approximation\\").Michael Kaser, Soviet Economics, 1970, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, pp. 150‚Äì51 . Although nominally a \\"centrally planned\\" economy, in reality formulation of the plan took place on a more local level of the production process as information was relayed from enterprises to planning ministries. Aside from the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc economies, this economic model was also utilized by the People's Republic of China, Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Republic of Cuba and North Korea.  Soviet Union  The Soviet Union and some of its European satellites aimed for a fully centrally planned economy. While they dispensed almost entirely with private ownership over the means of production, workers were still effectively paid a wage for their labour. Some believe that according to Marxist theory this should have been a step towards a genuine workers' state. However, some Marxists consider this a misunderstanding of Marx's views of historical materialism and his views of the process of socialization. The characteristics of this model of economy were: * Production quotas for every productive unit. A farm, mine or factory was judged on the basis of whether its production met the quota. It would be provided with a quota of the inputs it needed to start production, and then its quota of output would be taken away and given to downstream production units or distributed to consumers. * Allocation through political control. In contrast with systems where prices determined allocation of resources, in the Soviet Union, allocation, particularly of means of production was determined by the bureaucracy. The prices that were constructed were done so after the formulation of the economy plan, and such prices did not factor into choices about what was produced and how it was produced in the first place. * Full employment. Every worker was ensured employment. However workers were generally not directed to jobs. The central planning administration adjusted relative wages rates to influence job choice in accordance with the outlines of the current plan. * Clearing goods by planning: if a surplus of a product was accumulated, then the central planning authority would either reduce the quota for its production or increase the quota for its use. * Five-year plans for the long-term development of key industries. The planning system in the Soviet Union was introduced under Stalin between 1928 and 1934.Kaser, M C, Soviet Economics, 1970, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, p. 102 . Following the Second World War, in the seven countries with communist governments in Central and Eastern Europe, central planning with five- (or six-) year plans on the Soviet model had been introduced by 1951. The common features were the nationalization of industry, transport and trade, compulsory procurement in farming (but not collectivization) and a monopoly on foreign trade.Kaser, M C in Economic Reforms in the Socialist World, 1989, edited by Gomulka, Stanislav, Ha, Yong- Chool and Kim, Cae-One, New York: M E Sharpe, pp. 97‚Äì98. Prices were largely determined on the basis of the costs of inputs, a method derived from the labour theory of value. Prices did not therefore incentivize production enterprises whose inputs were instead purposely rationed by the central plan. This \\"taut planning\\" began around 1930 in the Soviet Union and was only attenuated after the economic reforms in 1966‚Äì1968 when enterprises were encouraged to make profits.Kaser, M C, Soviet Economics, 1970, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, pp. 172, 222 . According to the communist party, the stated purpose of planning was to enable the people through the party and state institutions to undertake activities that would have been frustrated by a market economy, including the rapid expansion of universal education and health care, urban development with mass good quality housing and industrial development of all regions of the country. Nevertheless, markets continued to exist in Soviet-type planned economies. Even after the collectivization of agriculture in the Soviet Union in the 1930s, members of the collective farm and anyone with a private garden plot were free to sell their own produce (farm workers were often paid in kind). Licensed markets operated in every town and city borough where non-state-owned enterprises (such as cooperatives and collective farms) were able to offer their products and services. From 1956 and 1959 onwards, all wartime controls over manpower were removed and people could apply and quit jobs freely in the Soviet Union. The use of market mechanisms went furthest in Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. From 1975, Soviet citizens had the right to engage in private handicraft and collective farmers could raise and sell livestock privately in 1981. It should also be noted that households were free to dispose of their income as they chose and incomes were lightly taxed.Kaser, M C, Soviet Economics, 1970, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, pp. 94‚Äì95, 107, 111‚Äì12, 127, 148, 165 . = Dispute that the Soviet model is socialism = Various scholars and political economists have criticized the claim that the centrally planned economy and specifically the Soviet model of economic development constitutes a form of socialism. They argue that the Soviet economy was structured upon the accumulation of capital and the extraction of surplus value from the working class by the planning agency in order to reinvest this surplus into the economy and to distribute to managers and senior officials, indicating the Soviet Union and other Soviet-style economies were state capitalist and unplanned administrative-command economies.Chomsky, Noam (1986). \\"The Soviet Union Versus Socialism\\". Chomsky.info. Retrieved 29 January 2020.Howard, M. C.; King, J. E. (2001). \\"'State Capitalism' in the Soviet Union\\". History of Economics Review. 34 (1): 110‚Äì26. .Wolff, Richard D. (27 June 2015). \\"Socialism Means Abolishing the Distinction Between Bosses and Employees\\". Truthout. Retrieved 29 January 2020. More fundamentally, these economies are still structured around the dynamic of capitalism, i.e. the accumulation of capital, production for profit (as opposed to being based on production for use‚Äîthe defining criterion for socialism) and the law of value, having not yet transcended the system of capitalism, but being in fact a variation of capitalism based on a process of state-directed accumulation. On the other side of the argument are those who contend that no surplus value was generated from labour activity or from commodity markets in the socialist planned economies and therefore claim that there was no exploiting class, even if inequalities existed.Tatyana Volkova and Felix Volkov, What is surplus value?, 1986, Moscow: Progress Publishers, p. 288. Since prices were controlled and set below market clearing levels, there was no element of value added at the point of sale as occurs in capitalist market economies. Prices were built up from the average cost of inputs, including wages, taxes, interest on stocks and working capital as well as allowances to cover the recoupment of investment and for depreciation, so there was no profit margin in the price charged to customers.Kaser, M C, Soviet Economics, 1970 (London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson) pp. 167‚Äì70 ; Brown, A, Kaser M C, and Smith G S (editors), The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Russia and the former Soviet Union, 1994, Cambridge University Press, p. 429 . Wages did not reflect the purchase price of labour since labour was not a commodity traded in a market and the employing organizations did not own the means of production. Wages were set at a level that permitted a decent standard of living and rewarded specialist skills and educational qualifications. In macroeconomic terms, the plan allocated the whole national product to workers in the form of wages for the workers' own use, with a fraction withheld for investment and imports from abroad. The difference between the average value of wages and the value of national output per worker did not imply the existence of surplus value since it was part of a consciously formulated plan for the development of society.John Eaton, Political Economy: A Marxist Textbook, 1949, London: Lawrence and Wishart, pp. 182‚Äì83. The presence of inequality in the socialist planned economies did not imply that an exploiting class existed. In the Soviet Union, communist party members were able to buy scarce goods in special shops and the leadership elite took advantage of state property to live in more spacious accommodation and sometimes luxury. Although they received privileges not commonly available and some additional income in kind, there was no difference in their official remuneration in comparison to their non-party peers. Enterprise managers and workers received only the wages and bonuses related to the production targets that had been set by the planning authorities. Outside of the cooperative sector which enjoyed greater economic freedoms and whose profits were shared among all members of the cooperative, there was no profit-taking class.Robert Service, Comrades ‚Äì Communism: A World History, 2007, London: Pan Macmillan, pp. 156‚Äì57 ; Brown, A, Kaser, M C, and Smith, G S (editors), The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Russia and the former Soviet Union, 1994, Cambridge University Press, p. 428 . Others maintain that workers in the Soviet Union and other Marxist‚ÄìLeninist states had genuine control over the means of production through institutions such as trade unions. Other socialist critics point to the lack of socialist social relations in these economies‚Äîspecifically the lack of self-management, a bureaucratic elite based on hierarchical and centralized powers of authority as well as the lack of genuine worker control over the means of production‚Äîleading them to conclude that they were not socialist but either bureaucratic collectivism or state capitalism. Trotskyists argue they are neither socialist nor capitalist‚Äîbut are deformed workers' states. This analysis is consistent with Lenin's April Theses in which he stated that the goal of the Bolshevik revolution was not the introduction of socialism which could only be established on a worldwide scale, but that it was intended to bring production and the state under the control of the Soviets of Workers' Deputies. Furthermore, these communist states often do not claim to have achieved socialism in their countries; on the contrary, they claim to be building and working toward the establishment of socialism in their countries. For example, the preamble to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam's constitution states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between capitalism and socialism after the country was re- unified under the Communist party in 1976,VN Embassy ‚Äì Constitution of 1992 Full Text. From the Preamble: \\"On 2 July 1976, the National Assembly of reunified Vietnam decided to change the country's name to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam; the country entered a period of transition to socialism, strove for national construction, and unyieldingly defended its frontiers while fulfilling its internationalist duty.\\" and the 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Cuba states that the role of the Communist Party is to \\"guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism\\".Cubanet ‚Äì Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, 1992 Full Text. From Article 5: \\"The Communist Party of Cuba, a follower of Mart√≠‚Äôs ideas and of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, and the organized vanguard of the Cuban nation, is the highest leading force of society and of the state, which organizes and guides the common effort toward the goals of the construction of socialism and the progress toward a communist society,\\" This view is challenged by Stalinists and their followers, who claim that socialism was established in the Soviet Union after Joseph Stalin came to power and instituted the system of five year plans. The 1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union, known as the Fundamental Law of Victorious Socialism, embodied the claim that the foundations for socialism had been laid.V Kashin and N Cherkasov, What is the Transition Period?, 1987, Moscow: Progress Publishers, pp. 140‚Äì41. Stalin introduced the theory of socialism in one country which argued that socialism can be built in a single country, despite existing in a global capitalist economic system. Nevertheless, it was recognized that the stage during which developed socialism would be built would be a lengthy one and would not be achieved by the Soviet Union on its own. According to the official textbooks, the first stage of the transition period from capitalism to socialism had been completed by the 1970s in the European socialist countries (except Poland and Yugoslavia) and in Mongolia and Cuba. The next stage of developed socialism would not be reached until \\"the economic integration of the socialist states becomes a major factor of their economic progress\\" and social relations had been reconstructed on \\"collectivist principles\\".V Kashin and N Cherkasov, What is the Transition Period?, 1987, Moscow: Progress Publishers, pp. 142‚Äì44; Sergei Ilyin and Alexander Motylev, What is Political Economy?, 1986 Moscow: Progress Publishers, p. 325. Communist writers accepted that during these earlier stages in constructing socialism the exchange of commodities on the basis of the average socially necessary labour embodied within them occurred and involved the mediation of money. Socialist planned economies were systems of commodity production but this was directed in a conscious way towards meeting the needs of the people and not left to the \\"anarchy of the market\\".John Eaton, Political Economy: A Marxist Textbook, 1949, London: Lawrence and Wishart, pp. 179‚Äì82; Stalin, J V, Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR (1952) in Selected Works Volume 1, 2012, Kolkata: Prometheus, pp. 317‚Äì25. At the stage of developed socialism, \\"the state of dictatorship of the proletariat changes into a state of all people reflecting the increasing homogeneity of society\\" and the \\"evening out of economic development levels\\" within and between socialist countries. It would provide the foundations for a further stage of perfected socialist society, where an abundance of goods permitted their distribution according to need. Only then could the world socialist system progress towards the higher phase of communism.V Kashin and N Cherkasov, What is the Transition Period?, 1987, Moscow: Progress Publishers, p. 144; Sergei Ilyin and Alexander Motylev, What is Political Economy?, 1986 Moscow: Progress Publishers, pp. 323‚Äì26, 330.  World socialist economic system  By the 1980s, the world economic socialist system embraced one- third of the world‚Äôs population but generated no more than 15 percent of global economic output. At its height in the mid-1980s, the world socialist system could be said to comprise the following countries with a \\"socialist orientation\\", though not all were allies of the Soviet Union: Afghanistan, Albania, Angola, Bulgaria, Cambodia, China, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Ethiopia, Hungary, Mozambique, Nicaragua, North Korea, Laos, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, Vietnam, South Yemen, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.Marie Lavigne, International Political Economy and Socialism, 1991, Cambridge University Press, pp. 54‚Äì55 . The system co-existed alongside the world capitalist system but was founded upon the principles of cooperation and mutual assistance rather than upon competition and rivalry. The countries involved aimed to even-out the level of economic development and to play an equal part in the international division of labour. An important role was played by the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) or Comecon, an international body set up to promote economic development. It involved joint planning activity, the establishment of international economic, scientific and technical bodies and methods of cooperation between state agencies and enterprises, including joint ventures and projects.Sergei Ilyin and Alexander Motylev, What is Political Economy?, 1986, Moscow: Progress Publishers, pp. 322‚Äì24. Allied to the CMEA were the International Development Bank, established in 1971; and the International Bank for Economic Cooperation, founded in 1963, which had their counterparts in the World Bank, the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund in the non- socialist world.Kaser, M C, Comecon: Integration problems of the planned economies, 1967, Oxford University Press, p. 170 . The main tasks of the CMEA were plan coordination, production specialization and regional trade. In 1961 Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, put forward proposals for establishing an integrated, centrally-planned socialist commonwealth in which each geographic region would specialize production in line with its set of natural and human resources. The resulting document, the \\"Basic Principles of the International Socialist Division of Labour\\" was adopted at the end of 1961, despite objections from Romania on certain aspects. The \\"Basic Principles\\" were never implemented fully and were replaced in 1971 by the adoption of the \\"Comprehensive Programme for Further Extension and Improvement of Cooperation and Development of Socialist Economic Integration\\". As a result, many specialization agreements were made between CMEA member states for investment programmes and projects. The importing country pledged to rely on the exporting country for its consumption of the product in question. Production specialization occurred in engineering, automotive, chemicals, computers and automation, telecommunications and biotechnology. Scientific and technical cooperation between CMEA member states was facilitated by the establishment in 1969 of the International Centre for Scientific and Technical Information in Moscow.Jenny Brine, Comecon: The rise and fall of an international socialist organization, 1992, New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University/Transaction, p. xii . Trade between CMEA member states was divided into \\"hard goods\\" and \\"soft goods\\". The former could be sold on world markets and the latter could not. Commodities such as food, energy products and raw materials tended to be hard goods and were traded within the CMEA area at world market prices. Manufactures tended to be soft goods‚Äîtheir prices were negotiable and often adjusted to make bilateral payment flows balance.Philip Hanson, The rise and fall of the Soviet economy: An economic history of the USSR, 2003, Harlow: Pearson Education, pp. 121, 131 . Other countries with privileged affiliation with the CMEA included Algeria, Benin, Burma, Congo, Finland, Madagascar, Mali, Mexico, Nigeria, Seychelles, Syria, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. The Soviet Union also provided substantial economic aid and technical assistance to developing countries including Egypt, India, Iraq, Iran, Somalia and Turkey. It supported developing countries in calling for a New International Economic Order and backed the UN Charter of Economic Rights and Obligations of States adopted by the General Assembly in 1974. Padma Desai, The Soviet Economy: Problems and Prospects, 1990, Oxford: Basil Blackwell, pp. 258‚Äì63  Achievements of the socialist planned economies  In the officially sanctioned textbooks describing the socialist planned economies as they existed in the 1980s, it was claimed as follows: * Class and national oppression had been totally eradicated. * Unemployment, hunger, poverty, illiteracy and uncertainty about the future had been eliminated. * Every citizen had a guaranteed right to work, rest, education, health care, abode and security in old age and maintenance in the event of disability. * Material standards of living were rising steadily and everyone had free access to knowledge and to the values of world and national culture. * Every citizen had a right in practice to take part in discussing and solving any problems in the life of the enterprise, region, republic and the country they lived in, including the rights to free speech, of assembly and to demonstrate.Sergei Ilyin and Alexander Motylev, What is Political Economy?, 1986, Moscow: Progress Publishers, pp. 271‚Äì72. Data collected by the United Nations of indicators of human development in the early 1990s show that a high level of social development was achieved in the former socialist planned economies of Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CEE/CIS). Life expectancy in the CEE/CIS area in the period 1985‚Äì1990 was 68 years, while for the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) it was 75 years.UN Department of Economic & Social Affairs, World Population Prospects: The 2012 Revision, File MORT/7.1. Data for 1985‚Äì1990. The world average was 64 years. Infant mortality in the CEE/CIS area was 25 for every 1,000 live births in 1990, compared to 13 in the OECD area.UN, 1994, Demographic Yearbook 1992, New York: United Nations Department for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis, Tables 4 and 20. Data is for 1990. The world average was 58 for every1,000 live births. In terms of education, the two areas enjoyed universal adult literacy and full enrolment of children in primary and secondary schools. For tertiary education, the CEE/CIS had 2,600 university students per 100,000 population, while in the OECD the comparable figure was 3,550 students. Overall enrolment at primary, secondary and tertiary levels was 75 percent in the CEE/CIS region and 82 percent in the OECD countries.UNDP, Human Development Report 1997, Tables 27 and 47; figures are for 1992‚Äì94. The world average is 1,490 students per 100,000 people and 60 percent for the gross enrolment ratio, combining all levels of education. Countries with a high intake at tertiary level to technical and vocational education such as Western Germany (2,320) had a similar ratio of university students to the socialist countries, reflecting a higher proportion of manufacturing and construction in their economies. . On housing the main problem was over-crowding rather than homelessness in the socialist planned economies. In the USSR the area of residential accommodation was 15.5 square meters per person by 1990 in urban areas but 15 percent of the population were without their own separate accommodation and had to live in communal apartments according to the 1989 census.Brown, A, Kaser, M C, Smith, G S (editors), The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Russia and the Former Soviet Union, 1994, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 411, 465 . Housing was generally of good quality in both the CEE/CIS region and in the OECD countries: 98 and 99 percent of the population in the OECD countries had access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation respectively, compared to 93 and 85 percent in the CEE/CIS area by 1990. Unemployment did not exist officially in the socialist planned economies, though there were people between jobs and a fraction of unemployable people as a result of illness, disability or other problems, such as alcoholism. The proportion of people changing jobs was between 6 and 13 percent of the labour force a year according to employment data during the 1970s and 1980s in Central and Eastern Europe and the USSR. Labour exchanges were established in the USSR in 1967 to help enterprises re-allocate workers and provide information on job vacancies. Compulsory unemployment insurance schemes operated in Bulgaria, Eastern Germany and Hungary but the numbers claiming support as a result of losing their job through no fault of their own numbered a few hundred a year.Brown, A, Kaser, M C, Smith, G S (editors), The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Russia and the Former Soviet Union, 1994, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 431, 464 ; and Porket, J L, Unemployment in Capitalist, Communist and Post- Communist Economies, 1995, London: Macmillan pp. 32‚Äì36 . By 1988, GDP per person, measured at purchasing power parity in US dollars, was $7,519 in Russia and $6,304 for the USSR. The highest income was to be found in Slovenia ($10,663) and Estonia ($9,078) and the lowest in Albania ($1,386) and Tajikistan ($2,730). Across the whole CEE/CIS area, GDP per person was estimated at $6,162. This compared to the USA with $20,651 and $16,006 for Germany in the same year. For the OECD area as a whole estimated GDP per person was $14,385.OECD National Accounts at a Glance, 2013 edition for 1988 GDP per capita at current purchasing power parities and current prices, Retrieved 1 November 2013. Thus, on the basis of IMF estimates, national income (GDP) per person in the CEE/CIS area was 43 percent of that in the OECD area.  Economic problems of the socialist planned economies  From the 1960s onwards, CMEA countries, beginning with East Germany, attempted \\"intensive\\" growth strategies, aiming to raise the productivity of labour and capital. However, in practice this meant that investment was shifted towards new branches of industry, including the electronics, computing, automotive and nuclear power sectors, leaving the traditional heavy industries dependent upon older technologies. Despite the rhetoric about modernization, innovation remained weak as enterprise managers preferred routine production that was easier to plan and brought them predictable bonuses. Embargoes on high technology exports organized through the US-supported CoCom arrangement hampered technology transfer. Enterprise managers also ignored inducements to introduce labour-saving measures as they wished to retain a reserve of personnel to be available to meet their production target by working at top speed when supplies were delayed.Archie Brown, and Michael Kaser, Soviet Policy for the 1980s, 1982, Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, pp. 188, 194, 200, 208 ; Simon Clarke (editor), Structural Adjustment without Mass Unemployment? Lessons from Russia, 1998, Cheltenham: Edward Elgar, pp. 23‚Äì28 ; Marie Lavigne, The Economies of Transition: From socialist economy to market economy, 1995, London: Macmillan, pp. 52‚Äì54, 60‚Äì61, 75‚Äì76, 248 ; Padma Desai, The Soviet Economy: Problems and Prospects, 1990, Oxford: Basil Blackwell, pp. 10‚Äì11 Under conditions of \\"taut planning\\", the economy was expected to produce a volume of output higher than the reported capacity of enterprises and there was no \\"slack\\" in the system. Enterprises faced a resource constraint and hoarded labour and other inputs and avoided sub-contracting intermediate production activities, preferring to retain the work in-house. The enterprise, according to the theory promulgated by J√°nos Kornai, was constrained by its resources not by the demand for its goods and services; nor was it constrained by its finances since the government was not likely to shut it down if it failed to meet its financial targets. Enterprises in socialist planned economies operated within a \\"soft\\" budget constraint, unlike enterprises in capitalist market economies which are demand-constrained and operate within \\"hard\\" budget constraints, as they face bankruptcy if their costs exceed their sales. As all producers were working in a resource- constrained economy they were perpetually in short supply and the shortages could never be eliminated, leading to chronic disruption of production schedules. The effect of this was to preserve a high level of employment.J√°nos Kornai, ‚Äò‚ÄôEconomics of Shortage‚Äô‚Äô, Amsterdam: North Holland; Marie Lavigne, The Economies of Transition: From socialist economy to market economy, 1995, London: Macmillan, pp. 60, 130‚Äì35, 248 As the supply of consumer goods failed to match rising incomes (because workers still received their pay even if they were not fully productive), household savings accumulated, indicating, in the official terminology, \\"postponed demand\\". Western economists called this \\"monetary overhang\\" or \\"repressed inflation\\". Prices on the black market were several times higher than in the official price-controlled outlets, reflecting the scarcity and possible illegality of the sale of these items. Therefore, although consumer welfare was reduced by shortages, the prices households paid for their regular consumption were lower than would have been the case had prices been set at market-clearing levels.Brown, A, and Kaser, M C, The Soviet Union Since the Fall of Khrushchev, 1978, London: Macmillan, pp. 212‚Äì14 ; Brown, A, and Kaser, M C, Soviet Policy for the 1980s, 1982, Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, p. 193 ; Marie Lavigne, The Economies of Transition: From socialist economy to market economy, 1995, London: Macmillan, pp. 61, 130‚Äì35 Over the course of the 1980s it became clear that the CMEA area was \\"in crisis\\", although it remained viable economically and was not expected to collapse.Marie Lavigne, The Economies of Transition: From socialist economy to market economy, 1995, London: Macmillan, pp. 76 and 248 The \\"extensive\\" growth model was retarding growth in the CMEA as a whole, with member countries dependent upon supplies of raw materials from the USSR and upon the Soviet market for sales of goods. The decline in growth rates reflected a combination of diminishing returns to capital accumulation and low innovation as well as micro-economic inefficiencies, which a high rate of saving and investment was unable to counter. The CMEA was supposed to ensure coordination of national plans but it failed even to develop a common methodology for planning which could be adopted by its member states. As each member state was reluctant to give up national self-sufficiency the CMEA‚Äôs efforts to encourage specialization was thwarted. There were very few joint ventures and therefore little intra-enterprise technology transfer and trade, which in the capitalist world was often undertaken by trans-national corporations. The International Bank for Economic Cooperation had no means of converting a country‚Äôs trade surplus into an option to buy goods and services from other CMEA members.Marie Lavigne, The Economies of Transition: From socialist economy to market economy, 1995, London: Macmillan, pp. 52‚Äì54, 75‚Äì76 = Transition to market economies = After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, many of the remaining socialist states presiding over centrally planned economies began introducing reforms that shifted their economies away from centralized planning. In Central and Eastern Europe and the USSR the transition from a planned economy to a market economy was accompanied by the transformation of the socialist mode of production to a capitalist mode of production. In Asia (China, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam) and in Cuba market mechanisms were introduced by the ruling communist parties and the planning system was reformed without systemic transformation. The transformation from socialism to capitalism involved a political shift: from a people‚Äôs democracy (see People's Republic and Communist state) with a constitutionally entrenched \\"leading role\\" for the communist and workers‚Äô parties in society to a liberal representative democracy with a separation of legislative, executive and judicial authorities and centres of private power that can act as a brake on the state‚Äôs activity.Boris Putrin, Political Terms: A short guide, 1982, Moscow: Novosti, p. 63; Samuel E Finer, Comparative Government, 1974, Harmondsworth: Penguin, pp. 66‚Äì71 . Vietnam adopted an economic model it formally titled the socialist-oriented market economy. This economic system is a form of mixed-economy consisting of state, private, co-operative and individual enterprises coordinated by the market mechanism. This system is intended to be transitional stage in the development of socialism.  Transition economies  The transformation of an economic system from a socialist planned economy to a capitalist market economy in Central and Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and Mongolia in the 1990s involved a series of institutional changes.Paul R Gregory and Robert C Stuart, The Global Economy and its Economic Systems, 2013, Independence, KY: Cengage Learning These included: * Control over the means of production was removed from the state through privatization and private property rights were re-established. In several countries property was restored to its former owners or their legal successors. If the actual property could not be returned the former owners received compensation. This occurred in Eastern Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Estonia. In all the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the government decided against restoration or compensation on the grounds that too much time had elapsed and in many cases compensation had already been made through bilateral treaties between the USSR and foreign governments representing the former owners. Voucher privatization in which citizens and workers in the enterprises received free or cheap shares was undertaken in most of the transition economies.Michael Kaser on Privatization in the CIS in Alan Smith (editor), Challenges for Russian Economic Reform, 1995, London: Royal Institute for International Affairs and Washington DC: The Brookings Institution, pp. 118‚Äì27. * The decision-making system was de- centralized through the ending of central planning and the privatization of enterprises. Work collectives and trade unions lost much of their influence in enterprise decision-making. * Markets became the dominant coordination mechanism following price liberalization and the de-control of foreign trade that permitted more or less unrestricted importation of goods in 1990/92. Queues at retail outlets disappeared as did hoarded inventories at factories. Stock exchanges were established between 1990 and 1995. Anti-monopoly legislation was introduced.Michael Kaser on Privatization in the CIS in Alan Smith (editor), Challenges for Russian Economic Reform, 1995, London: Royal Institute for International Affairs and Washington DC: The Brookings Institution, p. 126; Marie Lavigne, The Economies of Transition: From socialist economy to market economy, 1995, London: Macmillan, pp. 122‚Äì27 As workers lost their jobs or found their wages unpaid, informal labour markets sprang up along certain streets, particularly for construction trades.Simon Clarke (editor), Structural Adjustment without Mass Unemployment? Lessons from Russia, 1998, Cheltenham: Edward Elgar, pp. 53, 97‚Äì98 . * The incentive system was modified by the legalization of private enterprise and alteration to employment laws. A large informal sphere developed estimated at comprising 21 to 30 percent of official calculations of GDP. * The organizational forms prevailing in the socialist planned economies were restructured by breaking up vertically-integrated industrial and agricultural concerns and closing non- viable undertakings. The hardening of enterprise budget constraints was more significant in driving industrial restructuring than privatization according to some studies.Silvana Malle, The institutional framework of privatization and competition in economies in transition in Paul Hare, Judy Batt and Saul Estrin (editors), Reconstituting the Market: The political economy of microeconomic transformation, 1999, Amsterdam: Harwood, p. 391 * The distribution system became more unequal as price controls on necessities were removed fuelling the growth of poverty among people on fixed incomes such as pensioners and the unemployed. Redistributive measures through taxation and social safety nets proved unable to counteract the growth of poverty and, at the other end of the income scale, the emergence of a rich business elite (see also business oligarch). * The public choice mechanism was overhauled to rescind the communist party‚Äôs leading role and introduce a liberal constitution entrenching civil rights and representative democracy in almost all transition economies except Belarus, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.  People's Republic of China  China embraced a socialist planned economy after the Communist victory in its Civil War. Private property and private ownership of capital were abolished, and various forms of wealth made subject to state control or to workers' councils. The Chinese economy broadly adopted a similar system of production quotas and full employment by fiat to the Russian model. The Great Leap Forward saw a remarkably large-scale experiment with rapid collectivisation of agriculture and other ambitious goals. Results were less than expected (e.g. there were food shortages and mass starvation) and the program was abandoned after three years. In the common program set up by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949, in effect the country's interim constitution, state capitalism meant an economic system of corporatism. It provided as follows: \\"Whenever necessary and possible, private capital shall be encouraged to develop in the direction of state capitalism\\". In recent decades, China has opened its economy to foreign investment and to market-based trade, and has continued to experience strong economic growth. It has carefully managed the transition from a socialist planned economy to a market economy, officially referred to as the socialist commodity market economy which has been likened to state capitalism by some outside observers. The current Chinese economic system is characterized by state ownership combined with a strong private sector that privately owned enterprises that generate about 33% (People's Daily Online 2005) to over 50% of GDP in 2005, with a BusinessWeek article estimating 70% of GDP, a figure that might be even greater considering the Chengbao system. Some western observers note that the private sector is likely underestimated by state officials in calculation of GDP due to its propensity to ignore small private enterprises that are not registered. Most of the state and private sectors of economy are governed by free market practices, including a stock exchange for trading equity. The free-market is the arbitrator for most economic activity, which is left to the management of both state and private firms. A significant amount of privately owned firms exist, especially in the consumer service sector.\\"The Role of Planning in China's Market Economy\\". . Retrieved 7 June 2011. The state sector is concentrated in the commanding heights of the economy with a growing private sector engaged primarily in commodity production and light industry. Centralized directive planning based on mandatory output requirements and production quotas has been superseded by the free-market mechanism for most of the economy and directive planning is utilized in some large state industries. A major difference from the old planned economy is the privatization of state institutions. 150 state-owned enterprises remain and report directly to the central government, most having a number of subsidiaries. By 2008, these state-owned corporations had become increasingly dynamic largely contributing to the increase in revenue for the state. The state-sector led the economic recovery process and increased economic growth in 2009 after the financial crises. Proponents of this model distinguish themselves from market socialists who believe that economic planning is unattainable, undesirable or ineffective at distributing goods, viewing the market as the solution rather than a temporary phase in development of a socialist planned economy. This type of economic system is defended from a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist perspective which states that a socialist planned economy can only be possible after first establishing the necessary comprehensive commodity market economy, letting it fully develop until it exhausts its historical stage and gradually transforms itself into a planned economy.  Cuba  The Republic of Cuba under the leadership of Raul Castro began from 2006 to encourage co-operatives, worker-ownership and self- employment in a move to reduce the central role of state enterprise and state management within the economy, with the goal of building a \\"deeper\\" or more co-operative form of socialism. By 2018, there were 429 co-operatives in Cuba, many of which were previously state-owned enterprises.Frank, M., Explainer: The state of Raul Castro's economic reforms in Cuba, Reuters, published April 2018, accessed 28 December 2018  Vietnam  The Socialist Republic of Vietnam has pursued similar economic reforms to China, though less extensively, resulting in a socialist-oriented market economy, a mixed economy in which the state plays a dominant role intended to be a transitional phase in establishment of a socialist economy. = Social democratic mixed economies = Many of the industrialized, open countries of Western Europe experimented with one form of social democratic mixed economies or another during the 20th century. These include Britain (mixed economy and welfare state) from 1945 to 1979, France (state capitalism and indicative planning) from 1945 to 1982 under dirigisme, Sweden (social democratic welfare state) and Norway (state social democratic mixed economy) to the present. They are regarded as social democratic and reformist socialist experiments because they universally retained a wage-based economy and private ownership and control of the decisive means of production.Barrett, William, ed.

For example, government ownership in Sweden is limited primarily to railroads, mineral resources, a public bank, and liquor and tobacco operations.\\"Li, He (2015). Political Thought and China's Transformation: Ideas Shaping Reform in Post-Mao China. Springer. p. 69. . \\"The scholars in camp of democratic socialism believe that China should draw on the Sweden experience, which is suitable not only for the West but also for China. In the post-Mao China, the Chinese intellectuals are confronted with a variety of models. The liberals favor the American model and share the view that the Soviet model has become archaic and should be totally abandoned. Meanwhile, democratic socialism in Sweden provided an alternative model. Its sustained economic development and extensive welfare programs fascinated many. Numerous scholars within the democratic socialist camp argue that China should model itself politically and economically on Sweden, which is viewed as more genuinely socialist than China. There is a growing consensus among them that in the Nordic countries the welfare state has been extraordinarily successful in eliminating poverty.\\" Nevertheless, these western European countries tried to restructure their economies away from a purely private capitalist model. Variations range from social democratic welfare states such as in Sweden to mixed economies where a major percentage of GDP comes from the state sector such as in Norway which ranks among the highest countries in quality of life and equality of opportunity for its citizens. Elements of these efforts persist throughout Europe, even if they have repealed some aspects of public control and ownership. They are typically characterized by the following features: * Nationalization of key industries such as mining, oil, steel, energy and transportation. A common model is for a sector to be taken over by the state and then one or more state-owned enterprises set up for its day-to- day running. Advantages of nationalization include the ability of the state to direct investment in key industries, the distribution of state profits from nationalized industries for the overall national good, the ability to direct producers to social rather than market goals and greater control of the industries by and for the workers as well as the benefits and burdens of publicly funded research and development are extended to the wider populace. * Redistribution of wealth, through both tax and spending policies that aim to reduce economic inequalities. Social democracies typically employ various forms of progressive taxation regarding wage and business income, wealth, inheritance, capital gains and property. On the spending side, a set of social policies typically provides free access to public services such as education, health care and child care, while subsidized access to housing, food, pharmaceutical goods, water supply, waste management and electricity is also common. * Social security schemes where workers contribute to a mandatory public insurance program. The insurance typically include monetary provisions for retirement pensions and survivor benefits, permanent and temporary disabilities, unemployment and parental leave. Unlike private insurance, governmental schemes are based on public statutes and not contracts, so that contributions and benefits may change in time and are based on solidarity among participants. Its funding is done on an ongoing basis, without direct relationship with future liabilities. * Minimum wages, employment protection and trade union recognition rights for the benefit of workers. The objectives of these policies are to guarantee living wages and help produce full employment. There are a number of different models of trade union protection which evolved, but they all guarantee the right of workers to form unions, negotiate benefits and participate in strikes. Germany appointed union representatives at high levels in all corporations and had much less industrial strife than the United Kingdom, whose laws encouraged strikes rather than negotiation. * National planning for industrial development. * Demand management in a Keynesian fashion to help ensure economic growth and employment.  State capitalism  Various social democratic mixed economies are state capitalist, consisting of large commercial state enterprises that operate according to the laws of capitalism and pursue profits, that have evolved in countries which have been influenced by various elected socialist political parties and their economic reforms. While these policies and reforms did not change the fundamental aspect of capitalism and non-socialist elements within these countries supported or often implemented many of these reforms themselves, the result has been a set of economic institutions that were at least partly influenced by socialist ideology. = India = After gaining independence from Britain, India adopted a broadly socialist-inspired approach to economic growth. Like other countries with a democratic transition to a mixed economy, it did not abolish private property in capital. India proceeded by nationalizing various large privately run firms, creating state-owned enterprises and redistributing income through progressive taxation in a manner similar to social democratic Western European nations than to planned economies such as the Soviet Union or China. Today, India is often characterized as having a free-market economy that combines economic planning with the free market. However, it did adopt a very firm focus on national planning with a series of broad five-year plans. = Norway = Modern Norwegian state capitalism has its origins in public ownership of the country's oil reserves and in the country's post-World War II social democratic reforms. The government of Norway has ownership stakes in many of the country's largest publicly listed companies, owning 37% of the Oslo stockmarket and operates the country's largest non-listed companies including Statoil and Statkraft. The government also operates a sovereign wealth fund, the Government Pension Fund of Norway, whose partial objective is to prepare Norway for a post-oil future. = Singapore = Singapore pursued a state-led model of economic development under the People's Action Party which initially adopted a Leninist approach to politics and a broad socialist model of economic development. Originally, there was also infighting between moderates and radicals,Quee, Tan Jing (2001). Comet in Our Sky: Lim Chin Siong in History. Insan. .Chew, Melanie (2015). Leaders of Singapore.

The socialist policies practized the PAP during its first few decades in power were of a pragmatic kind as characterized by its rejection of nationalization. Despite this, the PAP was a member of the Socialist International and still claimed to be a socialist party, pointing out its regulation of the private sector, state intervention in the economy and social policies as evidence of this.Morley, James W. (1993). Driven by Growth: Political Change in the Asia-Pacific Region. Armonk, New York: M. E. Sharpe. The prime minister Lee Kuan Yew also stated that he has been influenced by the democratic socialist British Labour Party. Singapore's economy is dominated by state-owned enterprises and government-linked companies through Temasek Holdings which generate 60% of Singapore's GDP. Temasek Holdings operates like any other company in a market economy. Managers of the holding are rewarded according to profits with the explicit intention to cultivate an ownership mindset. The state also provides substantial public housing, free education and health and recreational services as well as comprehensive public transportation. Today, Singapore is often characterized as having a state capitalist economy that combines economic planning with the free market. While government-linked companies generate a majority of Singapore's GDP, moderate state planning in the economy has been reduced in recent decades. Nonetheless, while being the most right- wing of the Singaporean parties, the PAP has been described as centre-left and adopted a left tack in certain areas in order to remain electorally dominant.Azhar, Saeed; Chalmers, John (6 September 2015). \\"Singapore's rulers hope a nudge to the left will keep voters loyal\\". Reuters. Retrieved 19 August 2020. = Taiwan = Taiwan's economy has been classified as a state capitalist system influenced by its Leninist model of political control, with some Taiwanese economists referring to Taiwan's economy model as party-state capitalism, a legacy which still lingers in the decision-making process. Taiwan's economy includes a number of state-owned enterprises, but the Taiwanese state's role in the economy shifted from that of an entrepreneur to a minority investor in companies alongside the democratization agenda of the late 1980s. = Paris Commune = The Paris Commune was considered to be a prototype mode of economic and political organization for a future socialist society by Karl Marx. Private property in the means of production was abolished so that individuals and co-operative associations of producers owned productive property and introduced democratic measures where elected officials received no more in compensation than the average worker and could be recalled at any time. Anarchists also participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. George Woodcock manifests that \\"a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the libertarian collectivists Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and Elis√©e Reclus and Louise Michel\\".George Woodcock. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements (1962) = Social ownership and peer-to-peer production = Various forms of socialist organization based on co-operative decision making, workplace democracy and in some cases, production directly for use, have existed within the broader context of the capitalist mode of production since the Paris Commune. New forms of socialist institutional arrangements began to take form at the end of the 20th century with the advancement and proliferation of the internet and other tools that allow for collaborative decision-making. Michel Bauwens identifies the emergence of the open software movement and peer-to-peer production as an emergent alternative mode of production to the capitalist economy that is based on collaborative self- management, common ownership of resources, and the (direct) production of use- values through the free cooperation of producers who have access to distributed capital. Commons-based peer production generally involves developers who produce goods and services with no aim to profit directly, but freely contribute to a project relying upon an open common pool of resources and software code. In both cases, production is carried out directly for use‚Äîsoftware is produced solely for their use-value. wikipedia, being based on collaboration and cooperation and a freely associated individuals, has been cited as a template for how socialism might operate. This is a modern example of what the Paris Commune‚Äîa template for possible future organization‚Äîwas to Marx in his time.  Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia pursued a socialist economy based on autogestion or worker self-management. Rather than implementing a centrally planned economy, Yugoslavia developed a market socialist system where enterprises and firms were socially owned rather than publicly owned by the state. In these organizations, the management was elected directly by the workers in each firm, and were later organized according to Edvard Kardelj's theory of associated labor.  Self-managed enterprises  The Mondragon Corporation, a federation of cooperatives in the Basque region of Spain, organizes itself as an employee-owned, employee-managed enterprise. Similar styles of decentralized management which embrace cooperation and collaboration in place of traditional hierarchical management structures have been adopted by various private corporations such as Cisco Systems. Unlike Mondragon, Cisco remains firmly under private ownership. More fundamentally, employee-owned, self-managed enterprises still operate within the broader context of capitalism and are subject to the accumulation of capital and profit-loss mechanism. = Anarchist Spain = In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. In 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939). In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land. Even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists, who controlled the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the Soviet Union. The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organizational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia, and parts of the Levante. Much of Spain's economy was put under worker control and in anarchist strongholds such as Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%, although it was lower in areas with heavy Communist Party of Spain influence as the Soviet- allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes. Anarchist historian Sam Dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution which he claimed \\"came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history\\".Dolgoff (1974), p. 5  Criticism  Criticism of socialist economics comes from market economists such as the classicals, neoclassicals and Austrians as well as from some anarchist economists. Besides this, some socialist economic theories are criticized by other socialists. Libertarian socialist, mutualist and other market socialist economists criticize centralized economic planning and propose participatory economics and decentralized socialism. Market economists generally criticize socialism for eliminating the free market and its price signals which they consider necessary for rational economic calculation. They also consider that it causes a lack of incentive and believe that these problems lead to a slower rate of technological advance and a slower rate of growth of GDP. Austrian School economists such as Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises have argued that the elimination of private ownership of the means of production would inevitably create worse economic conditions for the general populace than those that would be found in market economies. They argue that without the price signals of the market it is impossible to calculate rationally how to allocate resources. Mises called this the economic calculation problem. Polish economist Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner responded to Mises' argument by developing the Lange Model during the economic calculation debate. The Lange model argues that an economy in which all production is performed by the state, where there is a functioning price mechanism, has similar properties to a market economy under perfect competition in that it achieves Pareto efficiency. The neoclassical view is that there is a lack of incentive, not a lack of information in a planned economy. They argue that within a socialist planned economy there is a lack of incentive to act on information. Therefore, the crucial missing element is not so much information as the Austrian School argued as it is the motivation to act on information.

Marxist philosophy may be broadly divided into Western Marxism, which drew out of various sources, and the official philosophy in the Soviet Union, which enforced a rigid reading of Marx called dialectical materialism, in particular during the 1930s. Marxist philosophy is not a strictly defined sub-field of philosophy, because the diverse influence of Marxist theory has extended into fields as varied as aesthetics, ethics, ontology, epistemology, theoretical psychology and philosophy of science, as well as its obvious influence on political philosophy and the philosophy of history. The key characteristics of Marxism in philosophy are its materialism and its commitment to political practice as the end goal of all thought. The theory is also about the hustles of the proletariat and their reprimand of the bourgeoisie. Marxist theorist Louis Althusser, for example, defined philosophy as \\"class struggle in theory\\", thus radically separating himself from those who claimed philosophers could adopt a \\"God's eye view\\" as a purely neutral judge. Marxism and philosophy The philosopher √âtienne Balibar wrote in 1996 that \\"there is no Marxist philosophy and there never will be; on the other hand, Marx is more important for philosophy than ever before.\\"√âtienne Balibar, 1993. La philosophie de Marx, La D√©couverte, Rep√®res (English edition, The Philosophy of Marx. Verso, 1995) So even the existence of Marxist philosophy is debatable (the answer may depend on what is meant by \\"philosophy,\\" a complicated question in itself). Balibar's remark is intended to explain the significance of the final line of Karl Marx's 11 Theses on Feuerbach (1845), which can be read as an epitaph for philosophy: \\"The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it\\". If this claim (which Marx originally intended as a criticism of German Idealism and the more moderate Young Hegelians) is still more or less the case in the 21st century, as many Marxists would claimHenri Lefebvre, 1965.

Verso, 2016), then Marxist theory is in fact the practical continuation of the philosophical tradition, while much of philosophy is still politically irrelevant. Many critics, both non-Marxist and some Marxist philosophers, feel that this is too quick a dismissal of the post-Marxian philosophical tradition. Much sophisticated and important thought has taken place after the writing of Marx and Engels; much or perhaps even all of it has been influenced, subtly or overtly, by Marxism. Simply dismissing all philosophy as sophistry might condemn Marxism to a simplistic empiricism or economism, crippling it in practice and making it comically simplistic at the level of theory. Nonetheless, the force of Marx's opposition to Hegelian idealism and to any \\"philosophy\\" divorced from political practice remains powerful even to a contemporary reader. Marxist and Marx-influenced 20th century theory, such as (to name a few random examples) the critical theory of the Frankfurt School, the political writing of Antonio Gramsci, and the neo- Marxism of Fredric Jameson, must take Marx's condemnation of philosophy into account, but many such thinkers also feel a strong need to remedy the perceived theoretical problems with orthodox Marxism. Such problems might include a too-simple economic determinism, an untenable theory of ideology as \\"false consciousness,\\" or a simplistic model of state power rather than hegemony. So Marxist philosophy must continue to take account of advances in the theory of politics developed after Marx, but it must also be wary of a descent into theoreticism or the temptations of idealism. √âtienne Balibar claimed that if one philosopher could be called a \\"Marxist philosopher\\", that one would doubtlessly be Louis Althusser: > Althusser proposed a 'new definition' of philosophy as \\"class struggle in > theory\\"... marxism had proper signification (and original \\"problematic\\") > only insofar as it was the theory of the tendency towards communism, and in > view of its realization. The criteria of acceptation or rejectal of a > 'marxist' proposition was always the same, whether it was presented as > 'epistemological' or as 'philosophical': it was in the act of rendering > intelligible a communist policy, or not.\\" (Ecrits pour Althusser, 1991, > p.98). However, \\"Althusser never ceased to put in question the images of communism that Marxist theory and ideology carried on: but he did it in the name of communism itself.\\" Althusser thus criticized the evolutionist image which made of communism an ultimate stage of history, as well as the apocalyptic images which made it a \\"society of transparence\\", \\"without contradiction\\" nor ideology. Balibar observes that, in the end, Althusser enjoined the most sober definition of communism, exposed by Marx in The German Ideology: Communism is \\"not a state of the future, but the real movement which destroys the existing state of being.\\".  Karl Marx's philosophy  Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was an important figure in the development of Marxism. There are endless interpretations of the \\"philosophy of Marx\\", from the interior of the Marxist movement as well as in its exterior. Although some have separated Marx's works between a \\"young Marx\\" (in particular the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844) and a \\"mature Marx\\" or also by separating it into purely philosophical works, economics works and political and historical interventions, √âtienne Balibar (1993) has pointed out that Marx's works can be divided into \\"economic works\\" (Das Kapital, 1867), \\"philosophical works\\" and \\"historical works\\" (The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, the 1871 Civil War in France which concerned the Paris Commune and acclaimed it as the first \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\", etc.) Marx's philosophy is thus inextricably linked to his critique of political economy and to his historical interventions in the workers' movement, such as the 1875 Critique of the Gotha Program or The Communist Manifesto, written with Engels (who was observing the Chartist movement) a year before the Revolutions of 1848. Both after the defeat of the French socialist movement during Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 1851 coup and then after the crushing of the 1871 Paris Commune, Marx's thought transformed itself. Marxism's philosophical roots were thus commonly explained as derived from three sources: English political economy, French republicanism and radicalism, and German idealist philosophy. Although this \\"three sources\\" model is an oversimplification, it still has some measure of truth. On the other hand, Costanzo Preve (1990) has assigned four \\"masters\\" to Marx: Epicurus (to whom he dedicated his thesis, Difference of natural philosophy between Democritus and Epicurus, 1841) for his materialism and theory of clinamen which opened up a realm of liberty; Jean-Jacques Rousseau, from which come his idea of egalitarian democracy; Adam Smith, from whom came the idea that the grounds of property is labour; and finally Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. \\"Vulgar Marxism\\" (or codified dialectical materialism) was seen as little other than a variety of economic determinism, with the alleged determination of the ideological superstructure by the economical infrastructure. This positivist reading, which mostly based itself on Engels' latter writings in an attempt to theorize \\"scientific socialism\\" (an expression coined by Engels) has been challenged by Marxist theorists, such as Lukacs, Gramsci, Althusser or, more recently, √âtienne Balibar. = Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel = Marx developed a comprehensive, theoretical understanding of political reality early in his intellectual and activist career by means of a critical adoption and radicalization of the categories of 18th and 19th century German Idealist thought. Of particular importance is Hegel's appropriation of Aristotle's organicist and essentialist categories in the light of Kant's transcendental turn.Meikle, Essentialism in the Thought of Karl Marx, Open Court Publishing Company (1985). Marx builds on four contributions Hegel makes to our philosophical understanding. They are: (1) the replacement of mechanism and atomism with Aristotelean categories of organicism and essentialism, (2) the idea that world history progresses through stages, (3) the difference between natural and historical (dialectical) change, and (4) the idea that dialectical change proceeds through contradictions in the thing itself. (1) Aristotelian organicism and essentialism (a) Hegel adopts the position that chance is not the basis of phenomena and that events are governed by laws. Some have falsely attributed to Hegel the position that phenomena are governed by transcendent, supersensible ideas that ground them. On the contrary, Hegel argues for the organic unity between universal and particular. Particulars are not mere token types of universals; rather, they relate to each other as a part relates to a whole. This latter has import for Marx's own conception of law and necessity. (b) In rejecting the idea that laws merely describe or independently ground phenomena, Hegel revives the Aristotlean position that law or principle is something implicit in a thing, a potentiality which is not actual but which is in the process of becoming actual. This means that if we want to know the principle governing something, we have to observe its typical life-process and figure out its characteristic behavior. Observing an acorn on its own, we can never deduce that it is an oak tree. To figure out what the acorn is - and also what the oak tree is - we have to observe the line of development from one to the other. (c) The phenomena of history arise from a whole with an essence which undergoes transformation of form and which has an end or telos. For Hegel, the essence of humanity is freedom, and the telos of that essence is the actualization of that freedom. Like Aristotle, Hegel believes the essence of a thing is revealed in the entire, typical process of development of that thing. Looked at purely formally, human society has a natural line of development in accordance with its essence just like any other living thing. This process of development appears as a succession of stages of world history. (2) Stages of world history Human history passes through several stages, in each of which is materialized a higher level of human consciousness of freedom. Each stage also has its own principle or law according to which it develops and lives in accordance with this freedom. Yet the law is not free- standing. It is delivered by means of the actions of men which spring from their needs, passions, and interests. Teleology, according to Hegel, is not opposed to the efficient causation provided by passion; on the contrary, the latter is the vehicle realizing the former. Hegel consistently lays more stress on passion than on the more historically specifiable interests of men. Marx will reverse this priority. (3) Difference between natural and historical change Hegel distinguishes as Aristotle did not between the application of organic, essentialist categories to the realm of human history and the realm of organic nature. According to Hegel, human history strives toward perfectibility, but nature does not. Marx deepens and expands this idea into the claim that humankind itself can adapt society to its own purposes rather than adapting themselves to it. Natural and historical change, according to Hegel, have two different kinds of essences. Organic natural entities develop through a straightforward process, relatively simple to comprehend at least in outline. Historical development, however, is a more complex process. Its specific difference is its \\"dialectical\\" character. The process of natural development occurs in a relatively straight line from the germ to the fully realized being and back to the germ again. Some accident from the outside might come along to interrupt this process of development, but if left to its own devices, it proceeds in a relatively straightforward manner. Society's historical development is internally more complex. The transaction from potentiality to actuality is mediated by consciousness and will. The essence realized in the development of human society is freedom, but freedom is precisely that ability to negate the smooth line of development and go off in novel, hitherto unforeseen directions. As humankind's essence reveals itself, that revelation is at the same time the subversion of itself. Spirit is constantly at war with itself. This appears as the contradictions constituting the essence of Spirit. (4) Contradiction In the development of a natural thing, there is by and large no contradiction between the process of development and the way that development must appear. So the transition from an acorn, to an oak, to an acorn again occurs in a relatively uninterrupted flow of the acorn back to itself again. When change in the essence takes place, as it does in the process of evolution, we can understand the change mostly in mechanical terms using principles of genetics and natural selection. The historical process, however, never attempts to preserve an essence in the first place. Rather, it develops an essence through successive forms. This means that at any moment on the path of historical change, there is a contradiction between what exists and what is in the process of coming-to-be. The realization of a natural thing like a tree is a process that by and large points back toward itself: every step of the process takes place in order to reproduce the genus. In the historical process, however, what exists, what is actual, is imperfect. It is inimical to the potential. What is trying to come into existence - freedom - inherently negates everything preceding it and everything existing, since no actual existing human institution can possibly embody pure human freedom. So the actual is both itself and its opposite (as potential). And this potential (freedom) is never inert but constantly exerts an impulse toward change. = Rupture with German idealism and the Young Hegelians = Marx did not study directly with Hegel, but after Hegel died Marx studied under one of Hegel's pupils, Bruno Bauer, a leader of the circle of Young Hegelians to whom Marx attached himself. However, Marx and Engels came to disagree with Bruno Bauer and the rest of the Young Hegelians about socialism and also about the usage of Hegel's dialectic. Having achieved his thesis on the Difference of natural philosophy between Democritus and Epicurus in 1841, the young Marx progressively broke away with the Prussian university and its teachings impregnated by German Idealism (Kant, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel). Along with Engels, who observed the Chartist movement in the United Kingdom, he cut away with the environment in which he grew up and encountered the proletariat in France and Germany. He then wrote a scathing criticism of the Young Hegelians in two books, The Holy Family (1845), and The German Ideology (1845), in which he criticized not only Bauer but also Max Stirner's The Ego and Its Own (1844), considered as one of the founding book of individualist anarchism. Max Stirner claimed that all ideals were inherently alienating, and that replacing God with Humanity, as did Ludwig Feuerbach in The Essence of Christianity (1841), was not sufficient. According to Stirner, any ideals, God, Humanity, the Nation, or even the Revolution alienated the \\"Ego\\". Marx also criticized Proudhon, who had become famous with his cry \\"Property is theft!\\", in The Poverty of Philosophy (1845). Marx's early writings are thus a response towards Hegel, German Idealism and a break with the rest of the Young Hegelians. Marx, \\"stood Hegel on his head,\\" in his own view of his role, by turning the idealistic dialectic into a materialistic one, in proposing that material circumstances shape ideas, instead of the other way around. In this, Marx was following the lead of Feuerbach. His theory of alienation, developed in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 (published in 1932), inspired itself from Feuerbach's critique of the alienation of Man in God through the objectivation of all his inherent characteristics (thus man projected on God all qualities which are in fact man's own quality which defines the \\"human nature\\"). But Marx also criticized Feuerbach for being insufficiently materialistic, as Stirner himself had pointed out, and explained that the alienation described by the Young Hegelians was in fact the result of the structure of the economy itself. Furthermore, he criticized Feuerbach's conception of human nature in his sixth thesis on Feuerbach as an abstract \\"kind\\" which incarnated itself in each singular individual: \\"Feuerbach resolves the essence of religion into the essence of man (menschliche Wesen, human nature). But the essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In reality, it is the ensemble of the social relations.\\" Thereupon, instead of founding itself on the singular, concrete individual subject, as did classic philosophy, including contractualism (Hobbes, John Locke and Rousseau) but also political economy, Marx began with the totality of social relations: labour, language and all which constitute our human existence. He claimed that individualism was the result of commodity fetishism or alienation. Some critics have claimed that meant that Marx enforced a strict social determinism which destroyed the possibility of free will.  Criticisms of human rights  In the same way, following Babeuf, considered as one of the founder of communism during the French Revolution, he criticized the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen as a \\"bourgeois declaration\\" of the rights of the \\"egoistic individual\\", ultimately based on the \\"right to private property\\", which economism deduced from its own implicit \\"philosophy of the subject\\", which asserts the preeminence of an individual and universal subject over social relations. On the other hand, Marx also criticized Bentham's utilitarianism. Alongside Freud, Nietzsche, and Durkheim, Marx thus takes a place amongst the 19th century philosophers who criticized this pre-eminence of the subject and its consciousness.See section on \\"The Individual and Society.\\" Instead, Marx saw consciousness as political. According to Marx, the recognition of these individual rights was the result of the universal extension of market relations to all of society and to all of the world, first through the primitive accumulation of capital (including the first period of European colonialism) and then through the globalization of the capitalist sphere. Such individual rights were the symmetric of the \\"right for the labourer\\" to \\"freely\\" sell his labor force on the marketplace through juridical contracts, and worked in the same time as an ideological means to discompose the collective grouping of producers required by the Industrial Revolution: thus, in the same time that the Industrial Era requires masses to concentrate themselves in factories and in cities, the individualist, \\"bourgeois\\" ideology separated themselves as competing homo economicus. Marx's critique of the ideology of the human rights thus departs from the counterrevolutionary critique by Edmund Burke, who dismissed the \\"rights of Man\\" in favour of the \\"rights of the individual\\": it is not grounded on an opposition to the Enlightenment's universalism and humanist project on behalf of the right of tradition, as in Burke's case, but rather on the claim that the ideology of economism and the ideology of the human rights are the reverse sides of the same coin. However, as √âtienne Balibar puts it, \\"the accent put on those contradictions can not not ring out on the signification of 'human rights', since these therefore appears both as the language in which exploitation masks itself and as the one in which the exploited class struggle express itself: more than a truth or an illusion, it is therefore a stake\\".√âtienne Balibar, The Philosophy of Marx, 1993, p.74 original edition Das Kapital ironizes on the \\"pompous catalogue of the human rights\\" in comparison to the \\"modest Magna Charta of a day work limited by law\\": But the communist revolution does not end with the negation of individual liberty and equality (\\"collectivism\\"Louis Dumont argued that Marx represented exacerbated individualism instead of holism as the popular interpretation of Marxism as \\"collectivism\\" would have it), but with the \\"negation of the negation\\": \\"individual property\\" in the capitalist regime is in fact the \\"expropriation of the immediate producers.\\" \\"Self-earned private property, that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated, independent laboring-individual with the conditions of his labor, is supplanted by capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labor of others, i.e., on wage-labor... The capitalist mode of appropriation, the result of the capitalist mode of production, produces capitalist private property. This is the first negation of individual private property, as founded on the labor of the proprietor. But capitalist production begets, with the inexorability of a law of Nature, its own negation. It is the negation of negation. This does not re-establish private property for the producer, but gives him individual property based on the acquisition of the capitalist era: i.e., on co-operation and the possession in common of the land and of the means of production.Karl Marx, Das Kapital, chapter XXXII, section 1  Criticisms of Ludwig Feuerbach  What distinguished Marx from Feuerbach was his view of Feuerbach's humanism as excessively abstract, and so no less ahistorical and idealist than what it purported to replace, namely the reified notion of God found in institutional Christianity that legitimized the repressive power of the Prussian state. Instead, Marx aspired to give ontological priority to what he called the \\"real life process\\" of real human beings, as he and Engels said in The German Ideology (1846): > In direct contrast to German philosophy, which descends from heaven to > earth, here we ascend from earth to heaven. That is to say, we do not set > out from what men say, imagine, conceive, nor from men as narrated, thought > of, imagined, conceived, in order to arrive at men in the flesh. We set out > from real, active men, and on the basis of their real life process we > demonstrate the development of the ideological reflexes and echoes of this > life process. The phantoms formed in the human brain are also, necessarily, > sublimates of their material life process, which is empirically verifiable > and bound to material premises. Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the > rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness, thus no > longer retain the semblance of independence. They have no history, no > development; but men, developing their material production and their > material intercourse, alter, along with this, their real existence, their > thinking, and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by > consciousness, but consciousness by life. Also, in his Theses on Feuerbach (1845), in which the young Marx broke with Feuerbach's idealism, he writes that \\"the philosophers have only described the world, in various ways, the point is to change it,\\" and his materialist approach allows for and empowers such change. This opposition between various subjective interpretations given by philosophers, which may be, in a sense, compared with Weltanschauung designed to legitimize the current state of affairs, and effective transformation of the world through praxis, which combines theory and practice in a materialist way, is what distinguish \\"Marxist philosophers\\" with the rest of philosophers. Indeed, Marx's break with German Idealism involves a new definition of philosophy; Louis Althusser, founder of \\"Structural Marxism\\" in the 1960s, would define it as \\"class struggle in theory\\". Marx's movement away from university philosophy and towards the workers' movement is thus inextricably linked to his rupture with his earlier writings, which pushed Marxist commentators to speak of a \\"young Marx\\" and a \\"mature Marx\\", although the nature of this cut poses problems. A year before the Revolutions of 1848, Marx and Engels thus wrote The Communist Manifesto, which was prepared to an imminent revolution, and ended with the famous cry: \\"Proletarians of all countries, unite!\\". However, Marx's thought changed again following Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte's December 2, 1851 coup, which put an end to the French Second Republic and created the Second Empire which would last until the 1870 Franco-Prussian War. Marx thereby modified his theory of alienation exposed in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 and would later arrive to his theory of commodity fetishism, exposed in the first chapter of the first book of Das Kapital (1867). This abandonment of the early theory of alienation would be amply discussed, and several Marxist theorists, including Marxist humanists such as the Praxis School, would return to it. Others, such as Althusser, would claim that the \\"epistemological break\\" between the \\"young Marx\\" and the \\"mature Marx\\" was such that no comparisons could be done between both works, marking a shift to a \\"scientific theory\\" of society. In 1844‚Äì1845, when Marx was starting to settle his account with Hegel and the Young Hegelians in his writings, he critiqued the Young Hegelians for limiting the horizon of their critique to religion and not taking up the critique of the state and civil society as paramount. Indeed, in 1844, by the look of Marx's writings in that period (most famous of which is the \\"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844\\", a text that most explicitly elaborated his theory of alienation), Marx's thinking could have taken at least three possible courses: the study of law, religion, and the state; the study of natural philosophy; and the study of political economy. He chose the last as the predominant focus of his studies for the rest of his life, largely on account of his previous experience as the editor of the newspaper Rheinische Zeitung on whose pages he fought for freedom of expression against Prussian censorship and made a rather idealist, legal defense for the Moselle peasants' customary right of collecting wood in the forest (this right was at the point of being criminalized and privatized by the state). It was Marx's inability to penetrate beneath the legal and polemical surface of the latter issue to its materialist, economic, and social roots that prompted him to critically study political economy.  Historical materialism  Marx summarized the materialistic aspect of his theory of history, otherwise known as historical materialism (this term was coined by Engels and popularised by Karl Kautsky and Georgi Plekhanov), in the 1859 preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy: > In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into > definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of > production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material > forces of production. The totality of these relations of production > constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which > arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite > forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life > conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. > It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but > their social existence that determines their consciousness. In this brief popularization of his ideas, Marx emphasized that social development sprang from the inherent contradictions within material life and the social superstructure. This notion is often understood as a simple historical narrative: primitive communism had developed into slave states. Slave states had developed into feudal societies. Those societies in turn became capitalist states, and those states would be overthrown by the self- conscious portion of their working-class, or proletariat, creating the conditions for socialism and, ultimately, a higher form of communism than that with which the whole process began. Marx illustrated his ideas most prominently by the development of capitalism from feudalism, and by the prediction of the development of socialism from capitalism. The base- superstructure and stadialist formulations in the 1859 preface took on canonical status in the subsequent development of orthodox Marxism, in particular in dialectical materialism (diamat, as it was known in the Soviet Union). They also gave way to a vulgar Marxism as plain economic determinism (or economism), which has been criticized by various Marxist theorists. \\"Vulgar Marxism\\" was seen as little other than a variety of economic determinism, with the alleged determination of the ideological superstructure by the economical infrastructure. However, this positivist reading, which mostly based itself on Engels' latter writings in an attempt to theorize \\"scientific socialism\\" (an expression coined by Engels) has been challenged by Marxist theorists, such as Antonio Gramsci or Althusser. Some believe that Marx regarded them merely as a shorthand summary of his huge ongoing work-in- progress (which was only published posthumously over a hundred years later as Grundrisse). These sprawling, voluminous notebooks that Marx put together for his research on political economy, particularly those materials associated with the study of \\"primitive communism\\" and pre-capitalist communal production, in fact, show a more radical turning \\"Hegel on his head\\" than heretofore acknowledged by most mainstream Marxists and Marxiologists. In lieu of the Enlightenment belief in historical progress and stages espoused by Hegel (often in a racist, Eurocentric manner, as in his Lectures on the Philosophy of History), Marx pursues in these research notes a decidedly empirical approach to analyzing historical changes and different modes of production, emphasizing without forcing them into a teleological paradigm the rich varieties of communal productions throughout the world and the critical importance of collective working-class antagonism in the development of capitalism. Moreover, Marx's rejection of the necessity of bourgeois revolution and appreciation of the obschina, the communal land system, in Russia in his letter to Vera Zasulich; respect for the egalitarian culture of North African Muslim commoners found in his letters from Algeria; and sympathetic and searching investigation of the global commons and indigenous cultures and practices in his notebooks, including the Ethnological Notebooks that he kept during his last years, all point to a historical Marx who was continuously developing his ideas until his deathbed and does not fit into any pre-existing ideological straitjacket. Differences within Marxist philosophy Some varieties of Marxist philosophy are strongly influenced by Hegel, emphasizing totality and even teleology: for example, the work of Georg Luk√°cs, whose influence extends to contemporary thinkers like Fredric Jameson. Others consider \\"totality\\" merely another version of Hegel's \\"spirit,\\" and thus condemn it as a crippling, secret idealism. Theodor Adorno, a leading philosopher of the Frankfurt School, who was strongly influenced by Hegel, tried to take a middle path between these extremes: Adorno contradicted Hegel's motto \\"the true is the whole\\" with his new version, \\"the whole is the false,\\" but he wished to preserve critical theory as a negative, oppositional version of the utopia described by Hegel's \\"spirit.\\" Adorno believed in totality and human potential as ends to be striven for, but not as certainties. The status of humanism in Marxist thought has been quite contentious. Many Marxists, especially Hegelian Marxists and also those committed to political programs (such as many Communist Parties), have been strongly humanist. These humanist Marxists believe that Marxism describes the true potential of human beings, and that this potential can be fulfilled in collective freedom after the Communist revolution has removed capitalism's constraints and subjugations of humanity. A particular version of the humanism within the marxism is represented by the school of Lev Vygotsky and his school in theoretical psychology (Alexis Leontiev, Laszlo GaraiInterview with Laszlo Garai on the Activity Theory of Alexis Leontiev and his own Theory of Social Identity as referred to the meta-theory of Lev Vygotsky. Journal of Russian and East European Psychology, vol. 50, no. 1, January‚ÄìFebruary 2012, pp. 50‚Äì64). The Praxis school based its theory on the writings of the young Marx, emphasizing the humanist and dialectical aspects thereof. However, other Marxists, especially those influenced by Louis Althusser, are just as strongly anti-humanist. Anti-humanist Marxists believe that ideas like \\"humanity,\\" \\"freedom,\\" and \\"human potential\\" are pure ideology, or theoretical versions of the bourgeois economic order. They feel that such concepts can only condemn Marxism to theoretical self-contradictions which may also hurt it politically.

Ferenc Lendvai, A fiatal Luk√°cs: utja Marxhoz, 1902‚Äì1918, Argumentum, 2008, p. 46; Istv√°n Hermann, Georg Luk√°cs: sein Leben und Wirken, B√∂hlau, 1986, p. 44. = Pre- Marxist period = Whilst at university in Budapest, Luk√°cs was part of socialist intellectual circles through which he met Ervin Szab√≥, an anarcho- syndicalist who introduced him to the works of Georges Sorel (1847‚Äì1922), the French proponent of revolutionary syndicalism. In that period, Luk√°cs's intellectual perspectives were modernist and anti-positivist. From 1904 to 1908, he was part of a theatre troupe that produced modernist, psychologically realistic plays by Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, and Gerhart Hauptmann. Luk√°cs spent much time in Germany, and studied at the University of Berlin from 1906 to 1907, during which time he made the acquaintance of the philosopher Georg Simmel. Later in 1913 whilst in Heidelberg, he befriended Max Weber, Emil Lask, Ernst Bloch, and Stefan George. The idealist system to which Luk√°cs subscribed at this time was intellectually indebted to neo- Kantianism (then the dominant philosophy in German universities) and to Plato, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Wilhelm Dilthey, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. In that period, he published Soul and Form (Die Seele und die Formen, Berlin, 1911; tr. 1974) and The Theory of the Novel (1916/1920; tr. 1971).Ben√©t's Reader's Encyclopedia Third Edition (1987) p. 588. After the beginning of the First World War, Luk√°cs was exempted from military service. In 1914, he married the Russian political activist Jelena Grabenko. In 1915, Luk√°cs returned to Budapest, where he was the leader of the \\"Sunday Circle\\", an intellectual salon. Its concerns were the cultural themes that arose from the existential works of Dostoyevsky, which thematically aligned with Luk√°cs's interests in his last years at Heidelberg. As a salon, the Sunday Circle sponsored cultural events whose participants included literary and musical avant-garde figures, such as Karl Mannheim, the composer B√©la Bart√≥k, B√©la Bal√°zs, Arnold Hauser, Zolt√°n Kod√°ly and Karl Polanyi; some of them also attended the weekly salons. In 1918, the last year of the First World War (1914‚Äì1918), the Sunday Circle became divided. They dissolved the salon because of their divergent politics; several of the leading members accompanied Luk√°cs into the Communist Party of Hungary. = Communist leader = Luk√°cs in 1919 In light of the First World War and the Russian Revolution of 1917, Luk√°cs rethought his ideas. He became a committed Marxist in this period and joined the fledgling Communist Party of Hungary in 1918. As part of the government of the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic, Luk√°cs was made People's Commissar for Education and Culture (he was deputy to the Commissar for Education Zsigmond Kunfi). It is said by J√≥zsef N√°dass that Luk√°cs was giving a lecture entitled \\"Old Culture and New Culture\\" to a packed hall when the republic was proclaimed which was interrupted due to the revolution.The Conversion of Georg Luk√°cs During the Hungarian Soviet Republic, Luk√°cs was a theoretician of the Hungarian version of the red terror.The hinterland of the white terror. Wien, 1920. Online: https://www.marxists.org/magyar/archive/lukacs/fth.htm In an article in the N√©pszava, 15 April 1919, he wrote that \\"The possession of the power of the state is also a moment for the destruction of the oppressing classes.

Online: http://mtdaportal.extra.hu/books/vary_albert_a_voros_uralom_aldozatai.pdf After the Hungarian Soviet Republic was defeated, Luk√°cs was ordered by Kun to remain behind with Ott√≥ Korvin, when the rest of the leadership evacuated. Luk√°cs and Korvin's mission was to clandestinely reorganize the communist movement, but this proved to be impossible. Luk√°cs went into hiding, with the help of photographer Olga M√°t√©. After Korvin's capture in 1919, Luk√°cs fled from Hungary to Vienna. He was arrested but was saved from extradition due to a group of writers including Thomas and Heinrich Mann. Thomas Mann later based the character Naphta on Luk√°cs in his novel The Magic Mountain. He married his second wife, Gertr√∫d Bortstieber in 1919 in Vienna, a fellow member of the Hungarian Communist Party. During his time in Vienna in the 1920s, Luk√°cs befriended other Left Communists who were working or in exile there, including Victor Serge, Adolf Joffe and Antonio Gramsci. Around that time, Luk√°cs began to develop Leninist ideas in the field of philosophy. His major works in this period were the essays collected in his magnum opus History and Class Consciousness (Geschichte und Klassenbewu√ütsein, Berlin, 1923). Although these essays display signs of what Vladimir Lenin referred to as \\"ultra-leftism\\", they provided Leninism with a substantive philosophical basis. In July 1924, Grigory Zinoviev attacked this book along with the work of Karl Korsch at the Fifth Comintern Congress. In 1924, shortly after Lenin's death, Luk√°cs published in Vienna the short study Lenin: A Study in the Unity of His Thought (Lenin: Studie √ºber den Zusammenhang seiner Gedanken). In 1925, he published a critical review of Nikolai Bukharin's manual of historical materialism. As a Hungarian exile, he remained active on the left wing of Hungarian Communist Party, and was opposed to the Moscow-backed programme of B√©la Kun. His \\"Blum theses\\" of 1928 called for the overthrow of the counter-revolutionary regime of Admiral Horthy in Hungary by a strategy similar to the Popular Fronts that arose in the 1930s. He advocated a \\"democratic dictatorship\\" of the proletariat and peasantry as a transitional stage leading to the dictatorship of the proletariat. After Luk√°cs's strategy was condemned by the Comintern, he retreated from active politics into theoretical work. Luk√°cs left Vienna in 1929 first for Berlin, then for Budapest. = Under Stalin and R√°kosi = In 1930, while residing in Budapest, Luk√°cs was summoned to Moscow. This coincided with the signing of a Viennese police order for his expulsion. Leaving their children to attend their studies, Luk√°cs and his wife ventured to Moscow in March 1930. Soon after his arrival, Luk√°cs was \\"prevented\\" from leaving and assigned to work alongside David Riazanov (\\"in the basement\\") at the Marx‚ÄìEngels Institute. Luk√°cs returned to Berlin in 1931 and in 1933 he once again left Berlin for Moscow to attend the Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences. During this time, Luk√°cs first came into contact with the unpublished works of the young Marx. Luk√°cs and his wife were not permitted to leave the Soviet Union until after the Second World War. During Stalin's Great Purge, Luk√°cs was sent to internal exile in Tashkent for a time, where he and Johannes Becher became friends. Luk√°cs survived the purges of the Great Terror, which claimed the lives of an estimated 80% of the Hungarian √©migr√©s in the Soviet Union . There is much debate among historians concerning the extent to which Luk√°cs accepted Stalinism. In 1945, Luk√°cs and his wife returned to Hungary. As a member of the Hungarian Communist Party, he took part in establishing the new Hungarian government. From 1945 Luk√°cs was a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Between 1945 and 1946 he strongly criticised non-communist philosophers and writers. Luk√°cs has been accused of playing an \\"administrative\\" (legal-bureaucratic) role in the removal of independent and non-communist intellectuals such as B√©la Hamvas, Istv√°n Bib√≥, Lajos Proh√°szka, and K√°roly Ker√©nyi from Hungarian academic life. Between 1946 and 1953, many non-communist intellectuals, including Bib√≥, were imprisoned or forced into menial work or manual labour. Luk√°cs's personal aesthetic and political position on culture was always that socialist culture would eventually triumph in terms of quality. He thought it should play out in terms of competing cultures, not by \\"administrative\\" measures. In 1948‚Äì49 Luk√°cs's position for cultural tolerance was smashed in a \\"Luk√°cs purge,\\" when M√°ty√°s R√°kosi turned his famous salami tactics on the Hungarian Communist Party. In the mid-1950s, Luk√°cs was reintegrated into party life. The party used him to help purge the Hungarian Writers' Union in 1955‚Äì1956. Tam√°s Acz√©l and Tibor M√©ray (former Secretaries of the Hungarian Writers' Union) both believe that Luk√°cs participated grudgingly, and cite Luk√°cs leaving the presidium and the meeting at the first break as evidence of this reluctance.Tam√°s Acz√©l, Tibor M√©ray (1960), The revolt of the mind: a case history of intellectual resistance behind the Iron Curtain. = De-Stalinisation = In 1956, Luk√°cs became a minister of the brief communist revolutionary government led by Imre Nagy, which opposed the Soviet Union. At this time Luk√°cs's daughter led a short-lived party of communist revolutionary youth. Luk√°cs's position on the 1956 revolution was that the Hungarian Communist Party would need to retreat into a coalition government of socialists, and slowly rebuild its credibility with the Hungarian people. While a minister in Nagy's revolutionary government, Luk√°cs also participated in trying to reform the Hungarian Communist Party on a new basis. This party, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, was rapidly co-opted by J√°nos K√°d√°r after 4 November 1956.. During the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, Luk√°cs was present at debates of the anti-party and revolutionary communist Pet≈ëfi Society while remaining part of the party apparatus. During the revolution, as mentioned in Budapest Diary, Luk√°cs argued for a new Soviet-aligned communist party. In Luk√°cs's view, the new party could win social leadership only by persuasion instead of force. Luk√°cs envisioned an alliance between the dissident communist Hungarian Revolutionary Youth Party, the revolutionary Hungarian Social Democratic Party and his own Soviet-aligned party as a very junior partner. Following the defeat of the Revolution, Luk√°cs was deported to the Socialist Republic of Romania with the rest of Nagy's government. Unlike Nagy, he avoided execution, albeit narrowly. Due to his role in Nagy's government, he was no longer trusted by the party apparatus. Luk√°cs's followers were indicted for political crimes throughout the 1960s and '70s, and a number fled to the West. Luk√°cs's books The Young Hegel (Der junge Hegel, Zurich, 1948) and The Destruction of Reason (Die Zerst√∂rung der Vernunft, Berlin, 1954) have been used to argue that Luk√°cs was covertly critical of Stalinism as an irrational distortion of Hegelian- Marxism. He returned to Budapest in 1957. Luk√°cs publicly abandoned his positions of 1956 and engaged in self-criticism. Having abandoned his earlier positions, Luk√°cs remained loyal to the Communist Party until his death in 1971. In his last years, following the uprisings in France and Czechoslovakia in 1968, Luk√°cs became more publicly critical of the Soviet Union and Hungarian Communist Party. In an interview just before his death, Luk√°cs remarked:  Work  = History and Class Consciousness = Written between 1919 and 1922 and published in 1923, Luk√°cs's collection of essays History and Class Consciousness contributed to debates concerning Marxism and its relation to sociology, politics and philosophy. With this work, Luk√°cs initiated the current of thought that came to be known as \\"Western Marxism\\". The most important essay in Luk√°cs's book introduces the concept of \\"reification\\". In capitalist societies, human properties, relations and actions are transformed into properties, relations and actions of man-produced things, which become independent of man and govern his life. These man-created things are then imagined to be originally independent of man. Moreover, human beings are transformed into thing-like beings that do not behave in a human way but according to the laws of the thing-world. This essay is notable for reconstructing aspects of Marx's theory of alienation before the publication of the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844, in which Marx most clearly expounds the theory. Luk√°cs also develops the Marxist theory of class consciousness - the distinction between the objective situation of a class and that class's subjective awareness of this situation. Luk√°cs proffers a view of a class as an \\"historical imputed subject\\". An empirically existing class can only successfully act when it becomes conscious of its historical situation, i.e. when it transforms from a \\"class in itself\\" to a \\"class for itself\\". Luk√°cs's theory of class consciousness has been influential within the sociology of knowledge. In his later career, Luk√°cs repudiated the ideas of History and Class Consciousness, in particular the belief in the proletariat as a \\"subject-object of history\\" (1960 Postface to French translation). As late as 1925‚Äì1926, he still defended these ideas, in an unfinished manuscript, which he called Tailism and the Dialectic. It was not published until 1996 in Hungarian and English in 2000 under the title A Defence of History and Class Consciousness.  What is Orthodox Marxism?  Luk√°cs argues that methodology is the only thing that distinguishes Marxism: even if all its substantive propositions were rejected, it would remain valid because of its distinctive method: He criticises Marxist revisionism by calling for the return to this Marxist method, which is fundamentally dialectical materialism. Luk√°cs conceives \\"revisionism\\" as inherent to the Marxist theory, insofar as dialectical materialism is, according to him, the product of class struggle: According to him, \\"The premise of dialectical materialism is, we recall: 'It is not men's consciousness that determines their existence, but on the contrary, their social existence that determines their consciousness.' ...Only when the core of existence stands revealed as a social process can existence be seen as the product, albeit the hitherto unconscious product, of human activity.\\" (¬ß5). In line with Marx's thought, he criticises the individualist bourgeois philosophy of the subject, which founds itself on the voluntary and conscious subject. Against this ideology, he asserts the primacy of social relations. Existence ‚Äì and thus the world ‚Äì is the product of human activity; but this can be seen only if the primacy of social process on individual consciousness is accepted. Luk√°cs does not restrain human liberty for sociological determinism: to the contrary, this production of existence is the possibility of praxis. He conceives the problem in the relationship between theory and practice. Luk√°cs quotes Marx's words: \\"It is not enough that thought should seek to realise itself; reality must also strive towards thought.\\" How does the thought of intellectuals relate to class struggle, if theory is not simply to lag behind history, as it is in Hegel's philosophy of history (\\"Minerva always comes at the dusk of night...\\")? Luk√°cs criticises Friedrich Engels's Anti-D√ºhring, saying that he \\"does not even mention the most vital interaction, namely the dialectical relation between subject and object in the historical process, let alone give it the prominence it deserves.\\" This dialectical relation between subject and object is the basis of Luk√°cs's critique of Immanuel Kant's epistemology, according to which the subject is the exterior, universal and contemplating subject, separated from the object. For Luk√°cs, \\"ideology\\" is a projection of the class consciousness of the bourgeoisie, which functions to prevent the proletariat from attaining consciousness of its revolutionary position. Ideology determines the \\"form of objectivity\\", thus the very structure of knowledge. According to Luk√°cs, real science must attain the \\"concrete totality\\" through which only it is possible to think the current form of objectivity as a historical period. Thus, the so- called eternal \\"laws\\" of economics are dismissed as the ideological illusion projected by the current form of objectivity (\\"What is Orthodoxical Marxism?\\", ¬ß3). He also writes: \\"It is only when the core of being has showed itself as social becoming, that the being itself can appear as a product, so far unconscious, of human activity, and this activity, in turn, as the decisive element of the transformation of being.\\" (\\"What is Orthodoxical Marxism?\\", ¬ß5) Finally, \\"orthodoxical marxism\\" is not defined as interpretation of Capital as if it were the Bible or an embrace of \\"marxist thesis\\", but as fidelity to the \\"marxist method\\", dialectics.  Reification and the Consciousness of the Proletariat  Drawing from the insights of Max Weber and Georg Simmel and Marx's magnum opus Capital, as well as Hegel's concept of appearance, Luk√°cs argues that commodity fetishism is the central structural problem of capitalist society. The essence of the commodity structure is that a relation between people takes on the character of a thing. Society subordinates production entirely to the increase of exchange-value and crystallises relations between human beings in to object-values. The commodity's fundamental nature is concealed: it appears to have autonomy and acquires a phantom objectivity. There are two sides to commodity fetishism: \\"Objectively a world of objects and relations between things springs into being (the world of commodities and their movements on the market) Subjectively - where the market economy has been fully developed - a man's activity becomes estranged from himself, it turns into a commodity which, subject to the non-human objectivity of the natural laws of society, must go its own way independently of man just like any consumer article.\\" A man is no longer a specific individual but part of a huge system of production and exchange. He is a mere unit of labour power, an article to be bought and sold according to the laws of the market. The principle of rationalisation of the productive mechanism based on what is and can be calculated extends to all fields, including human consciousness. Legal systems disregard tradition and reduce individuals to juridical units. Division of labour becomes increasingly specialised and particularised, confining the individual's productive activity to a narrower and narrower range of skills. As the bourgeoisie plays the dominant role in this system, it is contrary to its own interests to understand the system's transient historical character. Bourgeois consciousness is mystified. Bourgeois philosophy understands only empirical reality or normative ethics; it lacks the cognitive ability to grasp reality as a whole. Bourgeois rationalism has no interest in phenomena beyond what is calculable and predictable. Only the proletariat, which has no interest in the maintenance of capitalism, can relate to reality in a practical revolutionary way. When the proletariat becomes aware of its situation as a mere commodity in bourgeois society, it will be able to understand the social mechanism as a whole. The self-knowledge of the proletariat is more than just a perception of the world; it is a historical movement of emancipation, a liberation of humanity from the tyranny of reification. Luk√°cs saw the destruction of society as a proper solution to the \\"cultural contradiction of the epoch\\". In 1969 he cited: > ‚ÄúEven though my ideas were confused from a theoretical point of view, I saw > the revolutionary destruction of society as the one and only solution to the > cultural contradictions of the epoch. Such a worldwide overturning of values > cannot take place without the annihilation of the old values.Gy√∂rgy Lukacs, > ‚ÄúMon chemin vers Marx‚Äù (1969), Nouvelles Etudes hongroises (Budapest, 1973), > 8:78‚Äì79, cited in Michael L√∂wy, Georg Luk√°cs‚ÄîFrom Romanticism to Bolshevism, > trans. Patrick Camiller (London: NLB, 1979), 93. = Literary and aesthetic work = In addition to his standing as a Marxist political thinker, Luk√°cs was an influential literary critic of the twentieth century. His important work in literary criticism began early in his career, with The Theory of the Novel, a seminal work in literary theory and the theory of genre. The book is a history of the novel as a form, and an investigation into its distinct characteristics. In The Theory of the Novel, he coins the term \\"transcendental homelessness\\", which he defines as the \\"longing of all souls for the place in which they once belonged, and the 'nostalgia‚Ä¶ for utopian perfection, a nostalgia that feels itself and its desires to be the only true reality'\\".G. Lukacs, The Theory of the Novel, London: Merlin Press, 1963, p. 70.Young, Joyce. A Book Without Meaning: Why You Aren't Happy With the Ending of Infinite Jest. May 2009, p. 4. Luk√°cs later repudiated The Theory of the Novel, writing a lengthy introduction that described it as erroneous, but nonetheless containing a \\"romantic anti-capitalism\\" which would later develop into Marxism. (This introduction also contains his famous dismissal of Theodor Adorno and others in Western Marxism as having taken up residence in the \\"Grand Hotel Abyss\\".) Luk√°cs's later literary criticism includes the well-known essay \\"Kafka or Thomas Mann?\\", in which Luk√°cs argues for the work of Thomas Mann as a superior attempt to deal with the condition of modernity, and criticises Franz Kafka's brand of modernism. Luk√°cs steadfastly opposed the formal innovations of modernist writers like Kafka, James Joyce, and Samuel Beckett, preferring the traditional aesthetic of realism. During his time in Moscow in the 1930s, Luk√°cs worked on Marxist views of aesthetics while belonging to the group around an influential Moscow magazine \\"The Literary Critic\\" (Literaturny Kritik).Gutov D., Learn, learn and learn. In: Make Everything New ‚Äì A Project on Communism. Edited by Grant Watson, Gerrie van Noord & Gavin Everall. Published by Book Works and Project Arts Centre, Dublin, 2006 PP. 24‚Äì37. The editor of this magazine, Mikhail Lifshitz, was an important Soviet author on aesthetics. Lifshitz' views were very similar to Luk√°cs's insofar as both argued for the value of the traditional art; despite the drastic difference in age (Lifschitz was much younger) both Lifschitz and Luk√°cs indicated that their working relationship at that time was a collaboration of equals. Luk√°cs contributed frequently to this magazine, which was also followed by Marxist art theoreticians around the world through various translations published by the Soviet government. > The collaboration between Lifschitz and Luk√°cs resulted in the formation of > an informal circle of the like-minded Marxist intellectuals connected to the > journal Literaturnyi Kritik [The Literary Critic], published monthly > starting in the summer of 1933 by the Organisational Committee of the > Writers' Union. ... A group of thinkers formed around Lifschitz, Luk√°cs and > Andrei Platonov; they were concerned with articulating the aesthetical views > of Marx and creating a kind of Marxist aesthetics that had not yet been > properly formulated.Evgeni V. Pavlov, Perepiska (Letters), Mikhail Lifschitz > and Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs. Moscow: Grundrisse, 2011. Luk√°cs famously argued for the revolutionary character of the novels of Sir Walter Scott and Honor√© de Balzac. Luk√°cs felt that both authors' nostalgic, pro-aristocratic politics allowed them accurate and critical stances because of their opposition (albeit reactionary) to the rising bourgeoisie. This view was expressed in his later book The Historical Novel (published in Russian in 1937, then in Hungarian in 1947), as well as in his essay \\"Realism in the Balance\\" (1938). The Historical Novel is probably Luk√°cs's most influential work of literary history. In it he traces the development of the genre of historical fiction. While prior to 1789, he argues, people's consciousness of history was relatively underdeveloped, the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars that followed brought about a realisation of the constantly changing, evolving character of human existence. This new historical consciousness was reflected in the work of Sir Walter Scott, whose novels use 'representative' or 'typical' characters to dramatise major social conflicts and historical transformations, for example the dissolution of feudal society in the Scottish Highlands and the entrenchment of mercantile capitalism. Luk√°cs argues that Scott's new brand of historical realism was taken up by Balzac and Tolstoy, and enabled novelists to depict contemporary social life not as a static drama of fixed, universal types, but rather as a moment of history, constantly changing, open to the potential of revolutionary transformation. For this reason he sees these authors as progressive and their work as potentially radical, despite their own personal conservative politics. For Luk√°cs, this historical realist tradition began to give way after the 1848 revolutions, when the bourgeoisie ceased to be a progressive force and their role as agents of history was usurped by the proletariat. After this time, historical realism begins to sicken and lose its concern with social life as inescapably historical. He illustrates this point by comparing Flaubert's historical novel Salammb√¥ to that of the earlier realists. For him, Flaubert's work marks a turning away from relevant social issues and an elevation of style over substance. Why he does not discuss Sentimental Education, a novel much more overtly concerned with recent historical developments, is not clear. For much of his life Luk√°cs promoted a return to the realist tradition that he believed it had reached its height with Balzac and Scott, and bemoaned the supposed neglect of history that characterised modernism. The Historical Novel has been hugely influential in subsequent critical studies of historical fiction, and no serious analyst of the genre fails to engage at some level with Luk√°cs's arguments. = \\"Realism in the Balance\\" and defence of literary realism = \\"Realism in the Balance\\"\\"Realism in the Balance\\" (German: Es geht um den Realismus) is a 1938 essay by Georg Luk√°cs (written while he lived in Soviet Russia and first published in a German literary journal) in which he defends the \\"traditional\\" realism of authors like Thomas Mann in the face of rising Modernist movements, such as Expressionism, Surrealism, and Naturalism. Practitioners of these movements, such as James Joyce, placed an emphasis on displaying the discord and disenchantment of modern life through techniques that highlight individualism and individual consciousness, such as stream of consciousness. In his essay, Luk√°cs presents a complex, nuanced view of these movements and their relation to what he regards as \\"true\\" realism: On the one hand, Luk√°cs argues that such movements are a historical necessity, but he also strongly expresses the sentiment that these new artistic movements lack what he views as revolutionary power. The initial intent of \\"Realism in the Balance\\", stated at its outset, is debunking the claims of those defending Expressionism as a valuable literary movement. Luk√°cs addresses the discordance in the community of modernist critics, whom he regarded as incapable of deciding which writers were Expressionist and which were not, arguing that \\"perhaps there is no such thing as an Expressionist writer\\". Although his aim is ostensibly to criticise what he perceived as the over- valuation of modernist schools of writing at the time the article was published, Luk√°cs uses the essay as an opportunity to advance his formulation of the desirable alternative to these schools. He rejects the notion that modern art must necessarily manifest itself as a litany of sequential movements, beginning with Naturalism, and proceeding through Impressionism and Expressionism to culminate in Surrealism. For Luk√°cs, the important issue at stake was not the conflict that results from the modernists' evolving oppositions to classical forms, but rather the ability of art to confront an objective reality that exists in the world, an ability he found almost entirely lacking in modernism. Luk√°cs believed that desirable alternative to such modernism must therefore take the form of Realism, and he enlists the realist authors Maxim Gorky, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, and Romain Rolland to champion his cause. To frame the debate, Luk√°cs introduces the arguments of critic Ernst Bloch, a defender of Expressionism, and the author to whom Luk√°cs was chiefly responding. He maintains that modernists such as Bloch are too willing to ignore the realist tradition, an ignorance that he believes derives from a modernist rejection of a crucial tenet of Marxist theory, a rejection which he quotes Bloch as propounding. This tenet is the belief that the system of capitalism is \\"an objective totality of social relations,\\" and it is fundamental to Luk√°cs's arguments in favour of realism. He explains that the pervasiveness of capitalism, the unity in its economic and ideological theory, and its profound influence on social relations comprise a \\"closed integration\\" or \\"totality,\\" an objective whole that functions independent of human consciousness. Luk√°cs cites Marx to bolster this historical materialist worldview: \\"The relations of production in every society form a whole.\\" He further relies on Marx to argue that the bourgeoisie's unabated development of the world's markets are so far-reaching as to create a unified totality, and explains that because the increasing autonomy of elements of the capitalist system (such as the autonomy of currency) is perceived by society as \\"crisis,\\" there must be an underlying unity that binds these seemingly autonomous elements of the capitalist system together, and makes their separation appear as crisis. Returning to modernist forms, Luk√°cs stipulates that such theories disregard the relationship of literature to objective reality, in favour of the portrayal of subjective experience and immediacy that do little to evince the underlying capitalist totality of existence. It is clear that Luk√°cs regards the representation of reality as art's chief purpose‚Äîin this he is perhaps not in disagreement with the modernists‚Äîbut he maintains that \\"If a writer strives to represent reality as it truly is, i.e. if he is an authentic realist, then the question of totality plays a decisive role.\\" \\"True realists\\" demonstrate the importance of the social context, and since the unmasking of this objective totality is a crucial element in Luk√°cs's Marxist ideology, he privileges their authorial approach. Luk√°cs then sets up a dialectical opposition between two elements he believes inherent to human experience. He maintains that this dialectical relation exists between the \\"appearance\\" of events as subjective, unfettered experiences and their \\"essence\\" as provoked by the objective totality of capitalism. Luk√°cs explains that good realists, such as Thomas Mann, create a contrast between the consciousnesses of their characters (appearance) and a reality independent of them (essence). According to Luk√°cs, Mann succeeds because he creates this contrast. Conversely, modernist writers fail because they portray reality only as it appears to themselves and their characters‚Äîsubjectively‚Äîand \\"fail to pierce the surface\\" of these immediate, subjective experiences \\"to discover the underlying essence, i.e. the real factors that relate their experiences to the hidden social forces that produce them.\\" The pitfalls of relying on immediacy are manifold, according to Luk√°cs. Because the prejudices inculcated by the capitalist system are so insidious, they cannot be escaped without the abandonment of subjective experience and immediacy in the literary sphere. They can only be superseded by realist authors who \\"abandon and transcend the limits of immediacy, by scrutinising all subjective experiences and measuring them against social reality;\\" this is no easy task. Luk√°cs relies on Hegelian dialectics to explain how the relationship between this immediacy and abstraction effects a subtle indoctrination on the part of capitalist totality. The circulation of money, he explains, as well as other elements of capitalism, is entirely abstracted away from its place in the broader capitalist system, and therefore appears as a subjective immediacy, which elides its position as a crucial element of objective totality. Although abstraction can lead to the concealment of objective reality, it is necessary for art, and Luk√°cs believes that realist authors can successfully employ it \\"to penetrate the laws governing objective reality, and to uncover the deeper, hidden, mediated, not immediately perceptible of relationships that go to make up society.\\" After a great deal of intellectual effort, Luk√°cs claims a successful realist can discover these objective relationships and give them artistic shape in the form of a character's subjective experience. Then, by employing the technique of abstraction, the author can portray the character's experience of objective reality as the same kind of subjective, immediate experience that characterise totality's influence on non-fictional individuals. The best realists, he claims, \\"depict the vital, but not immediately obvious forces at work in objective reality.\\" They do so with such profundity and truth that the products of their imagination can potentially receive confirmation from subsequent historical events. The true masterpieces of realism can be appreciated as \\"wholes\\" which depict a wide-ranging and exhaustive objective reality like the one that exists in the non-fictional world. After advancing his formulation of a desirable literary school, a realism that depicts objective reality, Luk√°cs turns once again to the proponents of modernism. Citing Nietzsche, who argues that \\"the mark of every form of literary decadence ... is that life no longer dwells in the totality,\\" Luk√°cs strives to debunk modernist portrayals, claiming they reflect not on objective reality, but instead proceed from subjectivity to create a \\"home- made model of the contemporary world.\\" The abstraction (and immediacy) inherent in modernism portrays \\"essences\\" of capitalist domination divorced from their context, in a way that takes each essence in \\"isolation,\\" rather than taking into account the objective totality that is the foundation for all of them. Luk√°cs believes that the \\"social mission of literature\\" is to clarify the experience of the masses, and in turn show these masses that their experiences are influenced by the objective totality of capitalism, and his chief criticism of modernist schools of literature is that they fail to live up to this goal, instead proceeding inexorably towards more immediate, more subjective, more abstracted versions of fictional reality that ignore the objective reality of the capitalist system. Realism, because it creates apparently subjective experiences that demonstrate the essential social realities that provoke them, is for Luk√°cs the only defensible or valuable literary school of the early twentieth century. = Ontology of social being = Later in life, Luk√°cs undertook a major exposition on the ontology of social being, which has been partly published in English in three volumes. The work is a systematic treatment of dialectical philosophy in its materialist form.

Clayton was the eldest surviving son of Sir William Clayton, 1st Baronet (died 1744), and his wife Martha Kenrick, the daughter of John Kenrick, a London merchant. He was admitted at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge on 9 May 1732. He married Henrietta Maria Herring, daughter of Henry Herring, director of Bank of England on 13 February 1736. Clayton's father inherited from his uncle, Sir Robert Clayton, the manor of Bletchingley, and thereby controlled both seats in the rotten borough of Bletchingley. Clayton was returned with his father as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bletchingley on his father's interest at the 1734 British general election, and again at the 1741 British general election. He succeeded to the baronetcy on his father's death in 1744, and inherited his father's controlling interest both in Bletchingley and in the parliamentary borough of Great Marlow. He was returned at the subsequent general elections in 1747 and 1754 with his brother William. In about 1750 Lord Egmont describer the Claytons as 'strange people and not to be depended upon' but observed that their attendance was infrequent and they were irresolute in opposition. In 1753 Clayton applied for a church preferment for his brother-in-law Rev. John Thomas, which was granted the following year after Pelham had pointed out to Newcastle that he had a controlling interest in two parliamentary seats. He was returned for Bletchingly again in 1761 and in 1768 sat with his son Robert. Clayton died on 10 March 1769 leaving a son and two daughters. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Robert who died childless. The baronetcy then passed to Clayton's nephew William, son of his brother William.

Main St., became the first black-owned and operated bakery in the state when Hurtis Mixon Hadley, Sr., and his wife Dorothy Butler-Bishop Hadley of Portland, Oregon purchased it in 1977. At that time, there were fewer than two percent African-Americans in the state, and even fewer Black-owned businesses. The Oregon Historical Society Museum selected the Milwaukie Pastry Kitchen for inclusion in a permanent exhibit in 2014.  Historical context  Historically, Oregon's exclusion laws and institutional practices prohibited non-whites from settling in the state. Even after those laws were repealed in 1926, few African-Americans lived in Oregon. Black workers were attracted to Portland's shipyards between 1939 and 1945 to support the war effort, but discriminatory lending practices and segregationist real estate policies limited opportunities for Blacks to own businesses. Racial attitudes were slow to change. \\"Reflecting national trends resulting from the Civil Rights Movement, Portland's African-Americans began to receive more equal treatment in the 1950s. New areas of potential employment where they had traditionally been excluded opened.\\" The 1950 U.S. census records less than one percent of Oregon's population was African American; by 1990 it was about 1.7 percent. In 1959, Oregon voters finally ratified the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits states from denying citizens the right to vote based on \\"race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\\" The federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 also ensured greater opportunities and access for minority citizens. More than a decade later, Hurtis Mixon Hadley and his wife Dorothy Butler-Bishop Hadley purchased the Milwaukie Pastry Kitchen and opened for business. According to the Portland Observer, \\"Milwaukie Pastry Kitchen was not only the sole black-owned business in the city of Milwaukie at the time, it was the first black-owned bakery in the entire state of Oregon.\\" Hadley learned his trade in Oregon's three-year Baker's Technology and Apprenticeship program, completing and graduating from the program in two years, making him the first Black person in Oregon to be state-certified as a journeyman baker. As part of the apprenticeship program, Hadley attended Portland Community College, where he earned an Associate Degree in Baking Technology. According to the Northwest Labor Press, Hadley \\"...worked at several Albertsons in-store bakeries before accepting a job at the grocer as bakery manager/bakery trainer for the Oregon division. He had his eye on becoming a district manager, but was told at the time, 'Oregon isn't ready for a person of color in that position,' he said.\\"  Bakery operations, 1977 to 1985  Company vehicle advertisement sign Although the Milwaukie Pastry Kitchen had been founded in the 1940s, when the Hadleys purchased it in 1977, the shop had been closed for several years because of the owner's illness. One of the previous owners had been Einar \\"Ed\\" Carlson, a Swedish immigrant who had also baked at Tradewell stores before retiring in 1969. According to proprietor Hurtis Hadley, Sr., his first year owning the bakery was tough. Not everyone was pleased \\"to have an accomplished black couple in their midst at the time, or black people at all in the mostly white town.\\" During that year, he was even falsely accused of robbing another business. Hadley said that after that first year, \\"business and the general reception he and his wife received improved.\\" Milwaukie Pastry Kitchen was a full-line bakery that offered specialty breads, assorted pastries, and creative birthday and wedding cakes. One of the bakery's featured specialties was \\"Cake On Wheels\\" in which Hurtis Hadley delivered a specialty cake dressed in a top hat and tails. He also sang a customized song for the person and/or occasion. Hadley baked and Dorothy Hadley, a former licensed cosmetologist, managed the front of the store and coordinated the catering service. The bakery's slogan was \\"Put a Little Soul in Your Roll!\\" A photograph of the Hadleys in their bakery appeared in The Oregonian newspaper in 1979. It was used to illustrate an article, \\"Slogans Under Foot\\" about custom doormats such as the one at the bakery. The Hadleys' doormat featured the bakery slogan and an image of a baker carrying a steaming loaf of bread.  Bakery closing, 1985  For eight years the bakery provided pastries to the Milwaukie community, but the business closed in 1985 following the national recession during Ronald Reagan's presidency. The Milwaukie Pastry Kitchen was selected for inclusion in the Oregon Historical Society Museum permanent exhibit, \\"Oregon Voices: Change and Challenge in Modern Oregon History,\\" in 2014.

He works as an international consultant on creating livable neighborhoods and cities, owns a real estate company that renovates historic housing, and is an award-winning professor of urban and public affairs at the University of Louisville. In 2014 he was nominated as a Fellow of the Scholars Strategy Network housed at Harvard University. He has been ranked as one of the \\"top 100 urban thinkers in the world.\\" Early life and education John Gilderbloom was born in San Mateo, California to parents Murray Edward and Jeanette Lauder Gilderbloom (Dutch Gelderblom). He grew up in San Francisco in a creative environment of writers and musicians. His godfather was Dave Lewis, a Stanford University writing professor who was the co-author of Klute, which won an Academy Award for Best Picture in 1970. Mark Dowie, former publisher and editor of Mother Jones was a frequent Sunday guest for family meals. His uncle Clarence W. Gilderbloom was a respected inventor involved in developing patents for early versions of the dishwasher and a motorized Lazy Boy recliner. Another influential relative, Gilderbloom's distant aunt Hanneke Gelderblom, was known as \\"the Anne Frank that lived\\" and was featured in the documentary Sex, Drugs, and Democracy. She was elected a Senator in the Netherlands and worked at the International Court of Justice. Dr. Gilderbloom received his B.A. (1975), M.A. (1978), and Ph.D. (1983) in Sociology from the University of California, Santa Barbara. He graduated with the highest GPA in his graduating class (1975) with a straight A average. While at UCSB he took classes from and was mentored by Harvey Molotch, Richard Appelbaum, and took classes from David Harvey (who stayed with him while teaching at UCSB), Christopher Jencks, W. Dennis Keating, Michael Teitz, J√ºrgen Habermas, Roger Friedland, William Bielby, and William Domhoff. Community organizer In high school, Dr. Gilderbloom worked with protest groups against the Vietnam War, for environmental awareness following the Santa Barbara Oil Spill, and Cesar Chavez in the local Grape Boycott. In the 1970s Dr. Gilderbloom organized several local, state and national tenant organizations including the California Housing Action and Information Network to help pass rent control laws and other tenant protections. The Foundation for National Progress (Mother Jones) published an organizing manual, Rent Control: A Source Book which was adopted by the emerging tenant movement in the 1980s. Orange County's The Register called it the \\"Bible\\" of the rent control movement and it received both praise and attacks from The Nation, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal. He later published a book, Community Versus Commodity: Tenants and the American City on the renters movement with Stella Capek. Gilderbloom himself has experienced the landlords' wrath. He was advised to halt his study several times. \\"You'll never survive to finish your work,\\" one industry lobbyist warned him. In another instance, a real estate agent wrote one of the Governor's aides that: \\"We must find a way to neutralize him [Gilderbloom].\\" Today, 10% of the nation's renters are covered by some form of rent control, including these cities Dr. Gilderbloom advocated in: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Berkeley, West Hollywood, and Santa Monica and another 103 cities in New Jersey. Dr. Gilderbloom interned with Governor Jerry Brown and advocated for the governor to veto legislation prohibiting rent regulations. He later would veto this legislation in the California State Assembly. Similarly, Dr. Gilderbloom worked with Mitch Snyder, founder of the National Coalition for the Homeless, to block President Ronald Reagan from prohibiting federal funds to cities who have enacted rent control. He co-authored a study demonstrating that rent control was not correlated with increases in the homeless population, refuting William Tucker's research. President Reagan's proposal was defeated in Congress. Later Dr. Gilderbloom began work in poor neighborhoods to develop affordable, accessible, and attractive housing. He writes about his struggles in Promise and Betrayal: Universities and the Battle for Sustainable Urban Neighborhoods. Academic career Dr. Gilderbloom is a professor in the Department of Urban and Public Affairs at University of Louisville and director at the Center for Sustainable Urban Neighborhoods. His research interests include \\"[r]esearch methods, statistics, housing, community development, planning and design.\\" Dr. Gilderbloom is also the Director of the Center for Sustainable Urban Neighborhoods, a research center in the Urban Studies Institute at University of Louisville that explores ways to create more sustainable communities. He is a frequent collaborate with Dr. William (Billy) Riggs from University of San Francisco. Dr. Gilderbloom has written and edited five books and countless articles on issues concerning rental housing, poverty, health, community development, and urban policy. His work includes, \\"50 peer reviewed publications (including several in Journal of Urban Affairs), 30 book chapters, eight authored or co-authored books or journals, and [...] op-ed pieces in Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Sun-Times, USA Today Magazine, Governing Magazine, American Banker, Courier Journal, and many other outlets.\\" His book Rethinking Rental Housing was called \\"[T]he most significant piece on housing policy written in the last 40 years\\" by Daniel Lauber, past President of the American Planning Association. A National Housing Institute Survey of Books in Housing Courses found Rethinking Rental Housing to be the most widely chosen book in college housing courses. He later updated the book with new chapters and new numbers called: Invisible City: Housing, Poverty, and New Urbanism. Additionally, Dr. Gilderbloom contributed a chapter on modern Cuban architecture for the Encyclopedia of 20th-Century Architecture which won Planetizen's top ten best books in planning for 2005 and a chapter on the history of rent strikes for the Encyclopedia of Housing, 2nd edition, which won best reference book award from American Library Association.

Other work =Clinton Administration= Dr. Gilderbloom consulted with the Clinton Administration on \\"Clinton's first State of the Union Speech\\" and \\"Section 108 programs, Hope VI, and Community Outreach Partnership Programs.\\" He was recognized for his \\"extraordinary service to the President's Council on Sustainable Development\\" for his research. =Neighborhood revitalization= Dr. Gilderbloom runs a successful consulting business and has contributed his expertise on numerous neighborhood revitalization projects in West Louisville, Newport (KY), Covington (KY), and Southern Indiana worth over $100 million. His work has been featured in The New York Times. The East Russel Partnership, a collaboration between local organizations; city, state, and federal government; and the Center for Sustainable Urban Neighborhoods received the Sierra Club's Best Practices Award, given for smart growth projects for their success in West Louisville. He has also worked with cities to produce \\"green housing developments\\" in Louisville, Indianapolis, Muncie, IN; Covington, KY; and Newport, KY. =Real estate= Dr. Gilderbloom has restored 10 historic homes as a part of his business, one of which has been featured in The New York Times and been the set of the movie The Song. His homes are restored using principles of green design. Recognitions and achievements Dr. Gilderbloom's research has earned him numerous awards and recognitions throughout his career. His largest recognition was an international survey of planners and city officials of the Top 100 Urban Thinkers poll conducted by Planetizen, where he was ranked as 63 (placing him in the top forty for living urban thinkers). Additionally, he was chosen as one of the select few academics to be a commentator in Politico's \\"Arena.\\" He was awarded by the University of Louisville the Presidential Medal for Distinguished Faculty in Research and Creative Activity (2013). In 1997 he was awarded honorary membership in the Phi Kappa Phi for his \\"outstanding research and character\\". In 1982 Dr. Gilderbloom received the American Planning Association Chapter Award for Outstanding Contribution to Planning for his research on inter-city rent differentials and housing policy analysis. A year later in 1983, Dr. Gilderbloom received the Douglas A. McGregor Memorial Award for Outstanding Social Science from the Journal of Applied Behavioral Science for his research paper \\"Housing Supply and Regulation: A Study of Rental Housing Market\\", co-written with Dr. Richard Appelbaum. His work on rent control includes two books, eight scholarly articles, and numerous op-eds in publications including The Wall Street Journal and The Los Angeles Times, making him one of the most outspoken scholars on rent control.

The game was announced at the 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo and was released in August 2014, with a physical release of the game only being released in Europe and Australia. Played in a third-person perspective, the player takes control of Abigail \\"Fetch\\" Walker (introduced as a supporting character in Infamous Second Son), a young woman classed by the Department of Unified Protection as a \\"conduit\\" who possesses superhuman powers. In custody of the D.U.P., Fetch is ordered to tell the story of the events leading up to her capture. The player can use their Neon powers to defeat enemies and traverse the environment while completing the game's levels. The game primarily takes place in the streets of a fictionalized version of Seattle and in and around the prison, Curdun Cay. Infamous First Light received mostly positive reviews from critics, praising the protagonist Fetch, with some thinking she was a better character compared to Second Sons protagonist, Delsin, the visuals, controls, fast gameplay, and challenge arenas. Criticism was aimed towards the game's simple story and easy combat.  Gameplay  Infamous First Light is an action-adventure game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person perspective, similar to Infamous Second Son; players complete levels, defeat enemies and finish side missions. The player takes control of Abigail \\"Fetch\\" Walker, a young \\"conduit\\" who possesses superhero-like 'Neon' powers. With a few exceptions, Abigail's powers play identically to Delsin Rowe's Neon powers, but First Light introduces several new features. In Neon races, Fetch can chase down floating balls of Neon gas and Conduit energy called \\"Lumens\\" that reward her with skill points to increase her powers. The graffiti mini game from Second Son is present; it has been aesthetically altered to match Fetch's Neon style. In Arena Challenges, both Fetch and Delsin can fight against hordes of holographic enemies. Completing challenges rewards the player with skill points that they can use to upgrade their abilities. Exclusive to the arena is a new enemy faction: Demons, with their own unique powers and abilities.\\"INFAMOUS: FIRST LIGHT HAS LIGHTNING-FAST GAMEPLAY AND A LIFELESS STORY\\" Wired.

Plot Abigail \\"Fetch\\" Walker, a young conduit in the D.U.P.'s custody in their prison Curdun Cay, is ordered to give a demonstration of her powers to one Brooke Augustine by battling holographic foes created by fellow Conduit Eugene. Once that is done, Abigail is told to tell the events that led up to her arrest.inFAMOUS First Light Retrieved May 8, 2015. Seven years earlier, Abigail was one of the first of the new Conduits who emerge following The Beast's rampage across the countryside. Although her parents tried to cope at first, they were left with few options after Abigail injured one of her classmates by mistake. Abigail's older brother, Brent Walker, immediately grabbed Abigail and ran away with her; the pair turned to drug use to cope but Brent eventually got clean, even going as far as to hide Abigail's stash to help her get clean as well. Brent also made Abigail keep the use of her powers to a minimum to avoid suspicion. For years Brent worked for gangs to acquire enough funds to buy a boat and sneak across the border from Seattle to Canada where the D.U.P.'s authority does not extend. Unfortunately, two years ago at the point where the plot was supposed to be completed, the gang of Russian mobsters known as the Akurans destroyed the boat, took Brent hostage, and almost killed Abigail with a bomb. Using her powers, Abigail survives and begins looking for Brent. Abigail soon meets Shane: one of Brent's old contacts and a small-time drug lord also looking for Brent. Shane takes advantage of Abigail's naivete to use her to win a gang war with the Akurans almost single-handedly. When they do finally find Brent, Shane takes him hostage and forces Abigail to help him cement his hold on Seattle's drug trade. Back in the present, Augustine theorizes that the new powers Abigail develops may be a reaction to extreme trauma to help her cope. On the condition that she show her all of her powers, Augustine allows Abigail to fight holograms of her \\"D.U.P. Troops\\". Once the latest challenges are completed Abigail continues her story. Another employee of Shane's working for the city's tech support department, named Jenny, offers to help look for Brent. Jenny has narrowed down where Shane is keeping Brent to four shipping crates dotted around the city. Finding the crates not only does Abigail discover that Brent is not in any of them but Shane, already on to them, hunts down and kills Jennifer. Shane has Abigail help him force the police's favor by having Abigail slaughter the police force while he has a sit-down with the chief. The chief agrees to Shane's terms, on the condition that Abigail leaves Seattle and does not come back. With this, Shane sends Abigail to pick up her brother. Unfortunately it turns out to be a trap where Shane attempts to kill Abigail with a homemade gas chamber; Abigail however is able to pull through and escape. Back in the present, realizing that Abigail is still holding out on her, Augustine decides to send her to yet another new arena. Taking inspiration from Eugene's love of the Heaven's Hellfire game, Augustine has Abigail fight her now literal Demons. Once the third arena is completed, Augustine has Abigail finish the story. The still alive Abigail \\"negotiates\\" a new deal with Shane, he hands over Brent, alive and intact, and she stops tearing apart his gang and operation. Shane has Abigail meet him at the Crocodile where he sticks her with a drug filled needle. In the resulting drug filled haze, Abigail accidentally kills Brent, leaving her emotionally distraught and defenseless as the D.U.P. closes in on her. Back in the present Augustine reveals that she knew Abigail's story all along, she has been making her work up the nerve for murder, revealing that she has Shane in custody and offers Abigail the chance to kill him. Gladly accepting Augustine's offer Abigail's \\"enthusiasm\\" leads her to blow a hole in the wall of the prison into the outside world. Though Shane miraculously survives, battered and bruised, he escapes by hijacking an APC with the D.U.P. and the also now freed Abigail in hot pursuit. With the D.U.P.'s unwilling assistance, Abigail catches up to Shane and violently kills him, avenging her brother. Augustine, after she hears that Shane had been executed, states that Abigail is 'ready'. Alongside Eugene and another Conduit named Hank Daughtry, Abigail is released into the Military's custody. During the drive, Hank reveals he has smuggled in a bent paper clip to use it to pick their restraints, hijacking the truck, and crashes it at Salmon Bay. The game ends with Abigail, Eugene, and the other conduits escaping (except Hank who is still in the burning truck), while Delsin Rowe approaches the fire, leading into the events of Second Son. Development and release The game began development shortly after the release of Infamous Second Son. Nate Fox said it was an \\"easy\\" decision to make First Light. He said protagonist Fetch's \\"conflicted history and overall attitude made her the perfect fit for a standalone game.\\"Eddie, Makuch.(August 25, 2014). \\"PS4's Infamous: First Light Is 1080p, Spans About 4-5 Hours of Gameplay\\". GameSpot. Retrieved June 4, 2015. Fox also said that making the game was \\"really fun\\", and that \\"everyone already knows how to do everything development-related and the tools are all already in place, so you can go directly to making content.\\" Sucker Punch felt that Fetch's powers were different enough from Second Sons Delsin's powers to warrant a separate game. Even though Fetch's different powers alone provided gameplay variety, during development, Sucker Punch ensured that they felt \\"fluid\\" and \\"very different\\". Another focus for Sucker Punch was to make the overall tone darker than Second Son. Sucker Punch put Fetch in plenty of harsh situations where she is forced to be herself and fight her way out. During development, Sucker Punch placed a heavy emphasis on the characterization of protagonist Abigail 'Fetch' Walker.Farokhmanesh, Megan (August 13, 2014). \\"How did the dev of Infamous: First Light create a strong lady lead? By talking to a woman\\". Polygon. Retrieved June 4, 2015. Sucker Punch worked extensively with Fetch's voice actress Laura Bailey throughout the development of the game, often asking for her input in specific situations. The game's director Nate Fox stated: \\"When it came time to put in dialogue or talk about motivations, we called Laura Bailey or texted her. She would tell me what would be Fetch's view so it was accurate to the character, but also accurate to a woman's experience.\\" After the release of Second Son, Sucker Punch felt \\"compelled\\" to make a game about Fetch; Fox stated: \\"We made a game about Fetch because we liked Fetch.\\" The game was announced at E3 2014Petit, Carolyn.(June 9, 2014). \\"E3 2014: Standalone DLC for Infamous: Second Son Announced\\".

He scored an 8.5 out of 10 and stated: \\"Full stop, inFamous First Light is more Second Son, which is a good thing. Although I wasn't nearly as invested in Fetch as I was with Delsin's story, this is a great way for fans to return to the super-powered world of Seattle, and an even better way for newcomers to get a taste of the series.\\" Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead gave the game a mixed score of 6/10 saying: \\"First Lights weird, limbo nature makes it a hard one to pin down. Considered as a DLC add-on, it's pretty generous and fans of Second Son will certainly appreciate the extra backstory and another chance to romp around Seattle. As a standalone game, it earns points for trimming the fat from the open-world template, but is also as generic as they come. First Light is an adequate diversion for fans but unlikely to dazzle anybody else.\\" Andrew Reiner of Game Informer gave the game a positive score of 8/10 in his review. He summed up his review by saying: \\"InFamous First Light lacks some of the punch of Second Son in its campaign battles and familiar narrative marks, but is still a welcome addition to the series. Fetch is a fantastically written character, and the conclusion to her origin story is worth seeing in its entirety ‚Äì even if you already know what happens. Sucker Punch did a phenomenal job with the finale.\\" Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot gave the game a 6/10 in his review. He called protagonist Fetch an \\"engaging heroine\\", said the \\"Silky-smooth combat and locomotion make it a pleasure to move around Seattle\\", and said \\"blasting Department of Unified Protection guards and digital demons, is an absolute blast\\". He did however criticize the game for being too easy, saying: \\"Once you max out your homing missiles you can sleepwalk your way through challenge arenas.\\" He also called the mission design \\"uninspired\\" and disliked the characterization and dialogue. VideoGamer.com's Jamie Trinca scored the game a 7 out of 10, writing: \\"First Light is Second Son with most of the fat trimmed, making it ideal for newcomers.\\" Trinca had positive comments about protagonist Fetch; he mostly praised the character for not being a generic male who is tasked with saving the world, writing: \\"I like Fetch. She's infinitely more interesting than Delsin Rowe ‚Äî she's a flawed anti-hero, who has come to be defined by some extraordinarily bad decisions.\\" Trinca also thought the visuals were among the best on PlayStation 4, and complimented the cheap price, but felt the game lacked variety and featured repetitive gameplay. Dan Stapleton of IGN gave the game a 7.5 out of 10, praising the challenge maps, the story, the protagonist, Fetch, and the new powers. He summed up his review by saying: \\"InFamous First Light is a decent story around a better character than Second Son, but its battles don't have the same scale or superpower variety that Second Sons do. After the short campaign, its challenge maps put a new spin on combat by taking away your ability to escape danger on a whim, making it much tougher.\\" Polygon's Philip Kollar gave Infamous First Light an 8 out of 10 in his review. He said: \\"Despite how nicely their stories slot into one another, the ideal scenario for playing InFamous First Light is to have never touched Second Son. This works best as an introductory package for newcomers to the Infamous series, a tightly-wound, dramatic story with solid action and very little in the way of excess. It's not different enough from the Infamous game that released earlier this year to totally stand out, but it doesn't suffer much for that similarity.\\" Daniel Bischoff of Game Revolution gave the game a glowing review. \\"That inFamous First Light echoes the main game's themes of siblings and what it means to lose family struck me deeply,\\" Bischoff said, \\"especially as brotherhood has taken on different meanings for me over the years. With it written into the character's backstory, fans might know what to expect; still, I can't help but feel for Fetch above all else. Her imprisonment and Sucker Punch's use of a familiar location at the crux of this story breathe new life into neon-powered gameplay loops that had already proven themselves one of the best open-world mechanics yet.\\" Bischoff scored the game a 4.5 out of 5.

The bill authorizes $1.3 billion in funding for fiscal years 2015‚Äì2019. The bill was introduced and passed in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. On August 8, 2014, President Barack Obama signed the bill into law. The program and funding was once again reauthorized in 2019 with revisions. Background The \\"autism spectrum\\" or \\"autistic spectrum\\" describes a range of conditions classified as neurodevelopmental disorders in the fifth revision of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5). The DSM-5, published in 2013, redefined the autism spectrum to encompass the previous (DSM-IV-TR) diagnoses of autism, Asperger syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), childhood disintegrative disorder, and Rett syndrome. These disorders are characterized by social deficits and communication difficulties, stereotyped or repetitive behaviors and interests, and in some cases, cognitive delays. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found that 1 in every 59 American children have autism. The first federal autism research programs were created by the Autism Statistics, Surveillance, Research and Epidemiology Act (). Provisions of the law The law reauthorizes for five years existing federal autism research and assistance programs that would otherwise expire on October 1, 2014. The law requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to assign a deputy to be in charge of organizing and monitoring all federal research and autism services to ensure that they do not overlap and duplicate each other. This provision was written in reaction to a \\"Government Accountability Office finding last year that 84 percent of current autism research projects have potential to overlap.\\" Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on June 10, 2014 and then revised on June 20, 2014 to correct an error in the previous estimate. This is a public domain source. The law amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize research, surveillance, and education activities related to autism spectrum disorders (autism) conducted by various agencies within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Those activities are conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the National Institutes of Health. The law authorizes appropriations for autism activities at HHS of $260 million in 2015 and $1.3 billion over the 2015‚Äì2019 period. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that it would cost $1.1 billion over the 2015‚Äì2019 period, assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts. Pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply to this legislation because it would not affect direct spending or revenues. The law contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Combating Autism Reauthorization Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on May 9, 2014 by Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R, NJ-4). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Health. It was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-490 on June 23, 2014 with a title change to \\"Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education, and Support Act of 2014\\". On June 24, 2014, the House voted to pass the bill in a voice vote. The United States Senate voted with unanimous consent to pass the bill on July 31, 2014. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on August 8, 2014. Debate and discussion Rep. Michael F. Doyle (D-PA), who co-sponsored the bill, said that \\"every time new data is realized on autism spectrum disorders, the numbers become more and more troubling... this is why passage of the Autism Cares Act today is so important to continue research into the causes of autism.\\" Rep. Chris Smith, who introduced the bill, argued that \\"this is a critical investment that is working to determine the cause of ASD, identify autistic children as early as possible to begin treatment, and producing better awareness, new therapies and effective services. The quality of life of many children is at stake, as it is with young adults who age out of the support services in educational systems.\\" Liz Feld, the President of Autism Speaks, spoke in favor of the bill saying that the group \\"commends Representatives Smith and Doyle for their bipartisan leadership in spearheading this more aggressive federal response to autism.\\" The Autism Society of America also supported the bill. Rep. Bill Posey (R-FL) wrote an op-ed in The Hill arguing that the bill needed to be rewritten and improved. Posey argued that, after a federal program spent eight years and $1.7 billion trying to address the autism crisis and failed to do so, Washington was \\"on a path to rush through a five-year reauthorization, raise spending 20 percent and hope for better results without addressing fundamental structural flaws in the current program.\\" According to Posey, one flaw with the current system is that while the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee is charged with writing a strategic plan for organizing the research and spending on autism, the federal government ignores that strategy to have the National Institutes of Health instead, resulting in money being spend in a disjointed manner. Posey argued that he would like to take the time to improve this bill, possibly using some of the improvements suggested by the Autism Reform Policy Coalition, instead of moving forward too hastily with this bill.  Reauthorization in 2019  In 2019, H.R. 1058, the Autism CARES Act of 2019 (aka. the Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education, and Support Act of 2019 or the Autism CARES Act of 2019 Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education, and Support Act of 2019) once again reauthorized the program and funding. Specifically, the bill reauthorized provisions relating to expanded ASD research at the National Institutes of Health; the collection of state-level ASD data by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; ASD education, early detection, and intervention activities supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration; and the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee. The bill also generally revises the scope of those programs and activities to encompass ASD individuals of all ages, rather than only youth; focus funding on programs in areas with a shortage of personal health services; and reduce health-outcome disparities across diverse populations.

During his childhood, he went to Didsbury Preparatory School in 1928 and moved to Manchester Grammar School in 1934. He was appointed to the first Heath Harrison Chair of Organic Chemistry at the University of Liverpool 1957‚Äì1976. He did his MSc and PhD degrees under Lord Todd at Manchester and Cambridge Universities in UK. He married Jillian Bird in 1951 and they had two daughters both born in Cambridge. He was faculty member at the Cambridge University for 15 years before moving to the University of Liverpool in 1957 as Heath Harrison Professor of Organic Chemistry.  Achievements  George Kenner contributed to many areas of organic chemistry. In the 1960s, George Kenner, R.A. Gregory and Hilda Tracy were involved in the seminal discovery and synthesis of the peptide hormone gastrin at the University of Liverpool. Gastrin is involved in secretion of gastric acid (HCl) in the stomach. The first chemical synthesis of a lysozyme-like enzyme of 129 amino acids using classical approach was attempted by Kenner and his group at the University of Liverpool in 1970s. This was the largest protein synthesised in the laboratory using the classical peptide synthesis up to that time. He carefully planned synthesis of this lysozyme analogue, of proven purity, containing 129 amino acid residues joined in a rigorously defined order. His effort led to the synthesis of this 129 amino acid protein. His dream of making a wholly synthetic lysozyme was only achieved in 2007. The synthesis of functionally active lysozyme was done 30 years later by Steve B. Kent and his group at the University of Chicago. The value of George Kenner's contributions to the methodology of peptide chemistry had profoundly influence on the developments in the fields. For example it led to the synthesis of antigens of defined geometry for immunological studies. Kenner's work has been recognised by the awards of the Meldola Medal (1951) and the Corday-Morgan Medal (1957) and in distinguished lectureships such as Tilden (1955), Simonsen (1972) and Pedler (1976) of the Chemical Society of whose Perkin Division he was President from 1974 to 1976. He was also President of Section B of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1974. Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1964 he was the Society's Bakerian Lecturer for 1976 and was elected to a Royal Society Research Professorship in 1976.  The Kenner Prize and Awards at University of Liverpool  George Kenner Prize and Lectureship was established in 1979 with a sum of ¬£12,000 raised by subscription to commemorate the late Professor GW Kenner, Heath Harrison Professor of Organic Chemistry from 1957 to 1976 and Royal Society Professor from 1977 to 1978. The duty of the Lectureship recipient is to deliver lectures on subjects related to the study of Organic Chemistry at the University. Several famous organic chemists were awarded this honour and these include Gilbert Stork, Ryoji Noyori, Steven V. Ley, Albert Eschenmoser, John George Adami, Duilio Arigoni, and Jean-Marie Lehn. The George W. Kenner Award for graduate students was established in 2006 to commemorate Kenner who spent almost 21 years in the Chemistry department at the University of Liverpool as the Heath Harrison Professor of Organic Chemistry. The award is annually given to the first-year PhD student in the organic section of the Department of Chemistry who is the best in both academic and research performance.

The former church building was located in stadsparken, \\"the Town Park\\" and is locally known as Gamla kyrkans grund, \\"Fundament of the Old Church\\". Towards the end of the 18th century, the new Sofia Albertina Church was opened instead.

It was named for the Mission's leader, Roy Fedden.Christopher, John. The Race for Hitler's X-Planes (The Mill, Gloucestershire: History Press, 2013), pp.11-12. It visited Bad Oeynhausen, Bad Eilsen, V√∂lkenrode, Braunschweig, Magdeburg, Oschersleben Sta√üfurt, Dessau, Kothen, Nordhausen, G√∂ttingen, Kassel, Eisenach, Frankfurt, R√ºsselsheim, Darmstadt, Stuttgart, Esslingen, Reutlingen, Mengen, Lindau, Freising, Munich, Rosenheim, Kochel, Oberammergau, Kolbermoor, Salzburg, Spittal, Villach, and Klagenfurt.Christopher, map p.26. This is much less than the fifty-two locations they had intended to visit when the Mission began.Christopher, p.27 The Mission was inspired in part by the similar American scientific mission, Operation Paperclip, as well as by the German advances in jet aircraft and engines, as well as ballistic missiles, toward the war's end.Christopher, pp.7 & 9. It was also, in part, inspired by the desire to disarm Germany and prevent another postwar rise, like the one following the end of the First World War.Christopher, pp.36-8. (Unspoken, but also doubtless a factor, was a desire to keep Britain from becoming a second- rate nation.) In the event, the capture of German technology by both the United States and Soviet Union contributed to an acceleration of the postwar arms race.Christopher, pp.39 and 189. Organized at the instruction of Stafford Cripps, then Minister of Aircraft Production,Christopher, p.11. the Mission consisted of Fedden; Dr. W. J. Duncan, Professor of Aeronautics from University College of Hull, then seconded to the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE); J. C. King of RAE's Structural and Mechanical Engineering Department; Flight Lieutenant A. B. P. Beeton, RAF, of RAE's Engine Department; Bert Newport of Rotol, Ltd. They were assisted by W. J. Stern of the Allied Control Commission and Wing Commander V. Cross, RAF, the Mission's Liaison Officer to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (as well as its translator); their two RAF Dakotas were flown by F/L Reid, RAF, and F/L Cheany, RAFVR.Christopher, p.12. These aircraft each carried one of the Mission's Jeeps, which they soon learned to unload and have on the road in only ten minutes.Christopher, p.25 Everywhere the Mission went, it encountered looting by Allied troops and German civilians, and sabotage by German factory workers and the Heer (on Hitler's orders)Christopher, p.36-7. The German scientists and technicians were, in general, very co-operative with the British interviewers, with Fedden mentioning \\"considerable apprehension\\" about their fate and some wishing to emigrate to the U.S. or Canada.Christopher, p.54: Fedden quoted ibid. (They had genuine concern about forced emigration to the Soviet Union, as many of the V-2 program scientists suffered.) The Mission particularly criticized the RLM for its starting and stopping of engine production programs.Christopher, p.85  In Germany  =First week - June 12-16= The Mission left RAF Northolt on Tuesday, 12 June 1945 at 14.15, bound for B√ºckeburg, Germany, southwest of Hannover.Christopher, pp. 11 & 24. They reached B√ºckeburg at 16.30 and were immediately sent on to another airfield; they eventually reached Bad Eilsen, headquarters of Second Tactical Air Force, at 21.30. From there, they were driven to 21st Army Group.Christopher, pp.24 and 209, identifies them mistakenly as Second Army Group, a formation which appears not to exist. headquarters at Bad Oeynhausen, where they spent their first night.Christopher, p.24. Wing Commander Cross, by proposing one aircraft fly ahead to arrange accommodations, permits for interviews, travel permits for interview subjects, and so on, made an important contribution to the timely operation, and ultimate success, of the Mission. The Mission's access to German civilians was strictly limited by an Allied policy discouraging contact beyond what was strictly necessary.Christopher, p.30. The Mission based their initial forays out of Braunschweig, in the British Occupation Zone, where they spent their first six days, moving later to Kassel, in the American Zone. For their more southerly objecties, they worked out of Freising, headquarters of Third U.S. Army Intelligence, some from Hamburg, for another six days.Christopher, p.28 Their third base of operations was SHAEF Headquarters, Frankfurt. On their second full day in Germany, Thursday 14 June, they visited the most secret German aeronautical research establishment, the Hermann G√∂ring Institute (or Luftfahrtforschungsanstalt, LFA), at V√∂lkenrode; they remained there through 15 June.Christopher, pp.24-5, 27, 42, and 209. V√∂lkenrode, today a western district of the nearby city of Braunschweig, was at the top of Fedden's list ‚Äî despite its eventual presence on the west side of the Inner German border, with V√∂lkenrode being within West German borders ‚Äî because it was initially within the designated Russian Zone of Occupation, due to be handed over from British control (in which it was when he departed) in a matter of days.Christopher, pp.35-36. When the Mission arrived, the LFA had already been stripped by Combined Intelligence Objectives Subcommittee (CIOS) teams, and was (despite being in the British Zone) effectively in U.S. hands.Christopher, p.40. At V√∂lkenrode, the Mission examined the wind tunnels. These had been used to develop the swept wing, the forward-swept wing, the Messerschmitt Me 262, the BMW-designed cowlings used for all versions of the BMW 801 radial (used in the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 and a number of other important German military aircraft designs, especially in unitized engine formats), the Argus-designed pulsejet engine of the V-1 cruise missile, and other items. The members also viewed examples of the Rheinmetall-B√∂rsig F25 Feuerlilie surface-to-air missile, named for the Fire Lily flower (though the Mission Report shows photographs of the F55), and examples of documentation concerning the competing designs for the Amerika Bomber (which is suspected to not have included any mention, nor discovered any evidence of Heinkel's entry in the program), as well as the Engine Department.Christopher, pp.42-53. While the team found evidence of trials of photoelastic lacquers for stress tests, it proved impossible to interview any of the laboratory staff to learn more.Christopher, p.52. (Fedden considered the LFA Engine Department lacking in modern equipment, but the LFA complex possessed a better altitude test bed installation than any in Britain; a better example still would be seen at BMW's Munich facility.)Christophefr, p.53 The turbojet engine research artifacts found included examples of turbine and stator blade forms, blade cooling, blade construction (including hollow and ceramic types), piston cooling, and other matters. While at V√∂lkenrode, the Americans stole equipment from under the noses of the British (including an interferometer),Christopher, p.54. only to have the thefts denied when confronted by Britain at Potsdam.Christopher, pp.50-1. The Fedden Mission spent two days at V√∂lkenrode, its sub-team returning ten days later. The Mission left Braunschweig airfield 19.15 on Friday, 15 June for Kassel, away (where the Henschel firm's aviation division was based); next morning, one group went to G√∂ttingen to interrogate Dr. Ludwig Prandtl and his team;Christopher, pp.54-5 and 210. Fedden called them \\"a first class team of experimental research workers\\".quoted Christopher, p.55. While in G√∂ttingen, Mission members examined more than ten wind tunnels on the campus, plus several used for fluid dynamics studies. They spent 17 June in G√∂ttingen, also.Christopher, p.210 The same day, the second Mission group flew to Oschersleben (the home of AGO, a major Fw 190A subcontractor) then drove by Jeep to the Junkers jet engine plant at Magdeburg. They had little time before it, and all the surrounding territory, was handed over to the Soviets. The Junkers works, used for manufacturing and overhaul of Jumo 004 jet engines, had been heavily bombed; while there were a number of engine test-beds, there was no sign of jet engine research having been done there.Christopher, p.69 Otto Hartkopf, then acting works manager, conducted the Junkers factory tour, explaining all the jet engine drawings had already been removed. Hartkopf reported over 5,000 jet engines had been produced there in all;Christopher, p.69 production, including several other plants, was expected to reach 5,000 per month.Christopher, p.70 (At war's end, deliveries of 004s had reached 1,500 a month.) The Mission observed the construction methods of the 004; Fedden criticized the attachment of the 004's compressor casing, which was in two halves, bolted to the half-sections of the stator assemblies. =Second week (17-23 June 1945)= The Mission also examined production of the BMW 003 jet engine, at facilities in Eisenach and Sta√üfurt. On Monday, 18 June, it split in two teams again, one driving the Eisenach works. Fedden met with Dr. Bruno Bruckmann, head of BMW's jet engine research program in Berlin and strong supporter of jet engine production and use, as well as to drive propellers (turboprop engines); in 1942, Bruckman was made head of BMW piston engine programs. At Eisenach, the Mission spoke to the facility's managing director, Dr. Schaaf, and Drs. Fattler and Stoffergen, learning BMW employed 11,000 there in all, 4,500 in a camouflaged factory in the side of the hill, the rest in the town.Christopher, p.71 Despite adding plants at Spandau, Nordhausen, and Prague, BMW never reached the production target of 5,000 to 6,000 109-003 engines a month, with only some 500 examples of the 003 built before V-E Day. At Eisenach, the Mission discovered the BMW 003R had incorporated a reusable liquid fueled rocket engine in the rear of the nacelle, the BMW 109-718, to act as an assisted take-off unit, or to provide acceleration in climb or flight (akin to what the Americans postwar called \\"mixed power\\").Christopher, p.73 Fedden called the production quality at Eisenach \\"excellent\\". The next day, the Mission examined a BMW facility near Sta√üfurt, set up in a former salt mine underground, which was to have used for machining jet engine parts, and possibly for assembly, also; Stoffergen said 1,700 machine tools had been installed, and some 2,000 workers had been employed.Christopher, p. 74 The Mission also found some information on the high-thrust (designed for a 34.3 kN (7,700 lbf) top output level) BMW 018 jet engine project, which was begun in 1940, but remained unfinished by war's end; Fedden himself examined compressor blade forgings and a turbine blade. By Monday, June 18, the Mission drove from Kothen to Dessau, home of Junkers Flugzeug-und-Motorenwerke. Speaking to the technical director in charge of the inverted V12, liquid-cooled Junkers Jumo 213's development, the Mission learned there were many experimental variants, but only three [definitive] models: the 213A (the major production version), the 213E (a high-altitude model), and the projected 213J (improved still more).Christopher, p.79 The Mission visited Nordhausen (the Mittelwerk) 19 June, some by DC-3 Dakota, some by Jeep.Christopher, p.103 There, they first came in contact with concentration camps (among which Nordhausen was not officially counted). Nevertheless, Mission members found themselves revolted. With the handover to the Soviets only two days away, the Mission had little time to explore, and there was no well-informed guide.Christopher, pp. 120‚Äì121. They found hundreds of incomplete V-1s, and many spare parts for the V-2, even after the U.S. had spent the ten weeks since the factory was discovered stripping it before turning it over to the Soviets; as much as three hundred railcar-loads worth of material may have been removed, in addition to numerous complete V-2s.Christopher, p. 121. On Thursday, 21 June, the Fedden Mission travelled from Eisenach to Klobermoor, location of the Heinkel-Hirth engine works. There, they examined copies of the Heinkel HeS 011 jet engine, one of Germany's finest and most advanced turbine engines of the period, of which only 19 development and test examples were ever completed. The Mission conducted extensive interviews with the managing director, Mr. Schaaf, and the senior planning engineer, Mr. Dorls, as well as Hartkopf, comparing piston and jet engine production; the Mission compiled a table of comparative cost of materials, finding jets were between one half and two- thirds as costly, as well as being simpler and requiring lower-skill labor and less sophisticated tooling; in fact, most of making of hollow turbine blades and sheet metal work on jets could be done by tooling used in making automobile body panels.Christopher, pp.74-5. While Fedden was critical of some of the German design decisions,Fedden Report, quoted in Christopher, p. 75. the Mission estimated German jet engine production by mid-1946 would have been at a rate of at least 100,000 a year.Fedden Report, quoted in Christopher, p.76. The Mission was told the overhaul cycle for the Jumo 004 was between thirty and fifty hours (and about fifty for the BMW 003), and approximately 300 Jumo 004 engines had been rebuilt, some more than once.Christopher, p. 75 Between Wednesday, 20 June and the following Sunday (24 June), the Mission (billetted overnight 20‚Äì21 June at the Third U.S. Army's Intelligence Center,Christopher, p. 123. examined BMW's plant at Munich and interviewed Dr. Bruckmann, Fedden's old friend, technical director of BMW's engine programs; Dr. Amman, in charge of BMW's piston engine development; Mr. Willich, his top aide; and Dr. Sachse, senior engineer until 1942, and the man responsible for overseeing production of the 801 radial.Christopher, p.80. While at Munich, the Mission examined several 801 developments, including a turbocharged version with hollow turbine blades; several of these were apparently abandoned at Kassel's airfieldChristopher, p.81. They also examined the Wright Duplex- Cyclone displacement class BMW 802, an \\"interesting and unorthodox design\\" by Sachse;quoted Christopher, p.81. Fedden considered it \\"one of the most interesting piston engines seen in Germany\\".Christopher, p. 82 Of the 83.5-litre displacement class, BMW 803 possessing a 28-cylinder layout reminiscent of the Pratt & Whitney Wasp Major, but with the BMW four-row radial design using liquid cooling instead, as designed by Dr. Spiegel of Siemens, the final report remarked, \\"Its layout and design appeared clumsy and rather indifferent.\\"Christopher, p. 83 They also witnessed the BMW 003A-1 axial-flow turbojet run on the Herbitus test stand.Christopher, p. 186. Unable to visit Daimler-Benz's Stuttgart works until the second trip in July, the Mission nevertheless found contradictions between his briefing before departure and what his interviews with the company's general manager, Mr. Haspel, and chief designer, Dr. Schmidt, told him.Christopher, p.84. The Mission was informed development of the 24-cylinder Daimler-Benz DB 604 single-crankcase X engine had been stopped in 1940 by the RLM and had finally been abandoned by Daimler-Benz in September 1942; Daimler-Benz had considered 36-cylinder engines, as well.>Fedden at Flightglobal (accessed 16 July 1015) At V√∂lkenrode, the Mission found examples of Otto Lutz's swing-piston engine, developed co-operatively with Bussing of Braunschweig, with work also done by Mahle and Bosch. Fedden was dismissive. By contrast, he praised German use of wind tunnels in engine development, and suggested fuel injection was increasingly important for piston engines, especially as the number of cylinders rose.Fedden Report, quoted in Christopher, pp. 86‚Äì87. The Mission's examination of fuel injection research was hampered by being unable to speak to the injection specialists at Junkers in Magdeburg or Deckel in Munich, but at Munich, a member of Bosch's development department, Dr. Heinrich, advised the Mission members Germany had made few advances in the field beyond higher- capacity pumps,Christopher, p. 87 but learned BMW had preferred the Bosch closed nozzle for the 801, while Junkers chose the open nozzle for the Junkers Jumo 213 inverted V12 aviation engine. They got better information on German aircraft spark plugs, from BMW, Daimler, and Bosch, but not from Beru or Siemens, finding, in general, improvements focused on better performance at altitude or hotter, usually with better insulators or cooling. Investigation of propellers found new research had been halted when RLM decided to focus on jets, only to be resumed. The Mission's interviews were limited to Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke (United German Metalworks, VDM), and, at G√∂ttingen, they interviewed Dr. St√ºper, who tested VDM's reversible propeller. This three- bladed unit had links to two electric motors, which could change the pitch at two degrees per second for constant speed or 60-100¬∞ per second for braking (in reverse mode); it was scheduled for production early in 1945, to be used by the Dornier Do 335, Dornier Do 317, and Focke-Wulf Fw 190. Mission members visited VDM's forging works at Heddernheim, on the outskirts of Frankfurt.Christopher, p.88 Dr Eckert, of VDM spin-off company Continental Metall Gesellschaft (Continental Metal Company, CMG) confirmed St√ºper's claims, adding CMG contemplated switching to hydraulic cylinders. CMG also had a four-bladed project propeller that could eliminate engine overspeeding, by reducing pitch on two blades and increasing it on the other two.Christopher, pp.87-8. In addition, CMG had done some work on hollow propeller blades, one made from a simple rectangular tube with welded-on edges. Four members of the Mission went to Rosenheim and the BMW rocket development department at Bruckm√ºhl, joined by Dr. Bruckmann, who informed them RLM had ordered rocket development begun in 1944. They were shown the BMW 109-718 assist rocket first. They were also shown the 109-558, used in the Henschel Hs 117 Schmetterling guided missile; the Report praised the 558 (though mildly.Christopher, pp.126-127. In addition, the Mission was shown the 109-548, the sustainer motor for the Ruhrstahl X-4 (which Fedden described as an \\"inter-aircraft rocket\\").Christopher, p.132. 22 June, the Mission visited the Messerschmitt works at Oberammergau, in the Bavarian Alps, where a Bell Aircraft team had already been working some five weeks; there was also a representative from de Havilland. Messerschmitt had taken over a former Heer barracks in 1943, and constructed of tunnels.Christopher, pp. 155‚Äì156. The works there were a taste of the future, and Fedden interviewed a number of Messerschmitt's senior engineers, including Hans Hornung, Joseph Helmschrott, and chief designer Waldemar Voigt.Christopher, pp.156-157. The Mission were shown examples of the Me 262, with Voigt blaming inexperience among pilots, and compressor stalls, for several accidents.Christopher, p. 157 They also saw a variety of projected designs, including the P.1101 (the only one prototyped), P.1110,Christopher, p. 162. P.1112,.Christopher, p.163 and P.1108 (which Fedden, apparently, mis-identifies as the PL.08.01).  Allied bombing  The Fedden Mission, throughout its time in Germany, encountered the destructive effects of bombing. Indeed, on its first day in Germany, it could scarcely navigate through Braunschweig. Many of the factories they had hoped to visit, including Daimler-Benz's in Untert√ºrkheim (Stuttgart), Junkers' at Dessau, BMW's in Sta√üfurt, Bosch's in Stuttgart, and Junkers Jumo's at Magdeburg, were in ruinsChristopher, p.91 ‚Äî the twin Junkers facilities and the Sta√üfurt facility for BMW were to end up in the Soviet Zone of Occupation in a very short time. Yet many interview subjects reported Allied bombing of German communications, including railyards, trains, and roads, was ultimately more damaging to production than bombing of factories, since the works could be dispersed or restored to service with relative ease. The Germans reported communications attacks reduced production of piston aeroengines by spring 1945 to a third of what it had been.Fedden Report, quoted in Christopher, pp.77 and 100. For his part, Albert Speer wondered why the Allies never attacked the few engine manufacturing works, which, he suggested, would have crippled German production.quoted in Christopher, p.99.  The Second Mission  Most of the Mission returned to Britain on 1 July 1945, just Stern and Beeton remaining. 4 July, they arranged for the Mission to see BMW's high-altitude engine test bench in Munich, which Fedden and three others did 17 July, as part of an eight-day trip.Christopher, p.185 A sub-group of the Mission, with some further British aeronautical design engineers, returned to Germany from 16‚Äì25 July 1945, working out of Freising, to examine the BMW high-altitude test chamber at Munich, as well as German facilities at Stuttgart, G√∂ttingen, Volkenrode, and Kochel, in order to gather more information on German turbine manufacture and to witness the testing of the Goblin on the Munich testbed. The BMW facility, codenamed Herbitus, was designed and operated by Christoph Soestmeyer, and was finished in May 1944. It was used for trials on BMW and Jumo turbine engines, as well as the 801; Soestmeyer reported RLM had intended to build similar facilities at the central Luftwaffe test station, or Erprobungsstelle at Rechlin, and in Berlin, Dessau, and Stuttgart. The test facility was a building square and high, containing a steel cylindrical altitude chamber some in diameter and long, with a detachable rear section, allowing engines to be wheeled in and out for testing. It was capable of altitudes of as much as and test speeds .

Conceived during the creation of the 12th Five Year Plan, IbIn‚Äôs objective is to systematically promote capabilities that ensure coordination, collaboration, and implementation on issues, projects and policy within India. These capabilities include stakeholder alignment, project management, and policy advisory all of which require technical skills (for the process) as well as domain knowledge (pertaining to the specific subject matter or sector) knowledge. Since no single entity can provide all these skills and knowledge, IbIn is designed as a network that will cross-share and cross-link this information by leveraging partner organizations  Background  India has huge potential but there are many constraints to growth. A study of the root causes for why projects in India ‚Äúget stuck‚Äù highlighted issues like conflicting interests amongst stakeholders, and poor coordination between agencies. As a result, implementation failures exist at many levels ‚Äìat the centre, in the states, in districts and cities too. Therefore, to address these challenges to implementation, the 12th Five Year Plan recognized the need for a ‚Äúbackbone organization‚Äù, which led to the conceptualization of IbIn. The concept of the IBIN was then developed through extensive discussions within the country of the root causes for coordination and implementation failures and through exploration of methods of coordination and effective implementation adopted by other countries. The concept was then offered for criticism to an international panel of experts in national evolution strategies, consisting of Dani Rodrik and Ricardo Hausmann (Harvard Kennedy School of Public Policy), Charles Sabel (Columbia Law School), Francis Fukuyama (Stanford University) and Mushtaq Khan (London Univ.) IbIn was launched in April 2013 as a Planning Commission initiative under the leadership of Arun Maira and anchored by India@75. The website of IbIn was launched in August 2013. The 'IbIn Way' Lack of multi-stakeholder alignment is one of the main reason for poor implementation in a cooperation setup. In a diverse country such as India, this alignment cannot be achieved by either imposing authority or appointing selected ‚Äòexperts‚Äô to find a solution that will be imposed on the rest. An alternative approach would be to encourage all stakeholders to an open exploration towards achieving a common objective. Since such an open and deliberative process could be challenging to manage, the ‚ÄòIbIn‚Äô way emphasizes the use of proven and tested processes.  Structure of the IbIn movement  The movement has been modeled on the Total Quality Management (TQM) of Japan, which revolutionized Japan and made the manufacturing sector in Japan recognizable as an international benchmark for excellence. The IbIn movement has been envisaged as a backbone network structure. Since IbIn is modeled as a network, it will need some mechanism to disseminate its capabilities. One such mechanism is by establishing ‚Äònodes‚Äô. A node is a structural unit within another larger organization that promotes the use of IbIn processes and capabilities. Each node aims to bring three types of partners together. The partners either possess technical skills (in which case they are known as ‚Äòenablers‚Äô) or the ability to dedicate resources ‚Äì financial, human, knowledge, (known as ‚Äòsponsors‚Äô). The network is also composed of organizations that generate the demand for IbIn capabilities and thus help spread the word (thus known as ‚ÄòChannels‚Äô). The IbIn cell is the first node of the IbIn movement. The cell's core group constitutes of 7-8 professionals under the mentorship of Arun Maira. The IbIn cell is endorsed by the Planning Commission but anchored outside the official government structure at India @ 75.  IbIn activities  = Projects = IbIn cell is facilitating multi-stakeholder engagement over contentious issues like Industrial Relations and Affordable Healthcare. It is also involved projects that promote good practices like Business regulatory framework for India and Aspiration of elderly healthcare. = Capability building = IbIn cell is developing an India-centric tool box to develop capabilities in managing cooperation system. = Match-making/Node formation = Several nodes have also been by the IbIn cell to build specific capabilities in diverse areas: * PCMD division of Planning Commission: The Planning-Coordinating-Managing division (PCMD) is working on initiatives like Policy coherence, Think tank for policy formulation etc. * NIESBUD at Ministry of MSME: The National Institute for entrepreneurship and small business development (NIESBUD) is anchoring cluster stimulation cell for accelerated cluster growth. It is supported by Ministry of MSME. * Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP): DIPP is anchoring the business regulatory ratings initiative with the support from Planning Commission. Under this initiative, it would rank all the states in terms of ease of doing business in that state and promote good practices across states for improvement. * Sakal-Pemandu: PEMANDU and Sakal have inked a 50: 50 JV to launch a joint program in Maharashtra for ‚ÄòDeliver Maharashtra‚Äô program.

Other states of India are also exploring application of PEMANDU methodology in their respective states. * Bangalore Baptist Hospital: The BBH is anchoring an initiative for elderly healthcare.

In evaluations of health care quality, patient satisfaction is a performance indicator measured in a self-report study and a specific type of customer satisfaction metric. Validity as a metric for evaluating health care quality Because patients may be dissatisfied with health care which improves their health or satisfied with health care which does not, there are circumstances in which patient satisfaction is not a valid indicator of health care quality even though it is often used as such. Many studies have failed to identify a relationship between patient satisfaction and health care quality.The Farley paper cites these and others:   Factors influencing patient satisfaction Patients' satisfaction with an encounter with health care service is mainly dependent on the duration and efficiency of care, and how empathetic and communicative the health care providers are.Simple Tips to Improve Patient Satisfaction By Michael Pulia. American Academy of Emergency Medicine. 2011;18(1):18‚Äì19. It is favored by a good doctor-patient relationship. Also, patients who are well-informed of the necessary procedures in a clinical encounter, and the time it is expected to take, are generally more satisfied even if there is a longer waiting time. Another critical factor influencing patient satisfaction is the job satisfaction experienced by the care-provider. By region In the United States, hospitals whose surgery patients reported being highly satisfied also performed higher quality surgical procedures. The implication of this is that there does not need to be trade-off between high patient satisfaction and quality patient care. The Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems or CAHPS survey is an ongoing research project to guide the development of consumer surveys being used assess the quality of care provided by health plans, physician groups, and clinicians. It is an example of a major research effort which studies the significance of consumer responses to surveys. Research By 1998 the process of measuring and reporting of patient satisfaction had become an established industry. A concern about asking patients about the quality of their care is that patients tend to be more satisfied by attractive healthcare than by effective healthcare, and satisfaction reports may not give good information about the ability of a hospital, doctor, or treatment to improve their health. Higher patient satisfaction have been associated with less emergency department use but with greater inpatient use, higher overall health care and prescription drug expenditures, and increased mortality. Despite these concerns, more and more research has established customer satisfaction as a valid and reliable measure of customer behaviors and organizational performance. reduced complaint behavior about their primary care physician, and lower likelihood of terminating a relationship Among healthcare consumers‚Äîi.e., patients‚Äîsatisfaction is best understood as a multi-attribute model with different aspects of care determining overall satisfaction. Importantly, lower performance on an attribute creates much more dissatisfaction than the satisfaction generated by higher performance on an attribute; in other words, negative performance is more consequential than positive performance.Otani K, Harris L, Tierney W. A paradigm shift in patient satisfaction assessment. Medical Care Research And Review [serial online]. September 2003;60(3):347-365. Thus, ensuring overall patient satisfaction, it is more important to reduce negative performance on the patient-care dimension with the worst perceived performance than to maximize positive performance on another dimension. A fruitful solution can be measuring patient dissatisfaction instead of satisfaction.Omid Rasouli and Mohammad Hossein Zarei, \\"Monitoring and Reducing Patient Dissatisfaction: A Case Study of an Iranian Public Hospital\\", Total Quality Management & Business Excellence, vol. 27 no. 5-6, pp. 531-559, 2016. https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14783363.2015.1016869 References External links *Why Patient Satisfaction Matters Beyond Quality of Care *Patient Satisfaction-What healthcare industry can learn from e-retail industry? - Healtho5 Category:Product testing Category:Health care quality Category:Patient ","title":"Patient satisfaction"},{"id":"43070185","text":"River Street Station is a former railroad station for the Erie Railroad in the community of Paterson, New Jersey.

Kline, 73, Chemical Consultant It is a more detailed classification of the previous one, that distinguished chemical commodities into two subclasses, called respectively \\"true commodities\\" and \\"pseudocommodities\\". In general the classification of chemical industry products by the Kline matrix is related to the chemicals' worldwide production (measured for example in tons/year) and to their value added.Emisawa Hiroshi, \\"How to Manage for Maximum Profit.\\" Following this classification, the chemical industry products are divided into four categories: * true commodity: high production and high value added * fine chemical: low production and high value added * pseudo-commodity (or branded commodity): high production and low value added * speciality chemical: low production and low value added.  Basic chemicals  The concept of basic chemicals is very close to chemical commodities. In fact basic chemicals are chemical substances used as a starting material for the production of a wide variety of other chemicals; for this reason they are in general commodities, http://scuole.federchimica.it/Universita/Schede_di_approfondimento_sui_settori/Chimica_di_base.aspx because they are highly demanded. Some examples of basic chemicals are: ethylene, benzene, chlorine and sulfuric acid.  High production volume chemical  High Production Volume (HPV) Chemicals is another commercial classification of chemical substances very close to chemical commodities. This categories is used in US and includes all the chemicals produced or imported by US in an amount higher than 1 million pounds.

Hosted in New York state and originally owned and operated by a teenage hacker who called himself Quasi-Moto, whom was a member of the short lived yet famed Fargo 4A phreak group. The popular bulletin board system attracted a large group of hackers, telephone phreaks, engineers, computer programmers, and other technophiles, at one point reaching over 600 users until LDX, a long distance phone company, began blocking all calls to its number (516-935-2481). Naming and creation The name Plover-NET came from a conversation between Quasi Moto, and Greg Schaefer. The topic of computer games came up. One of them, the 'Extended Adventure' game which was based on the 'Original Adventure' fantasy computer game was mentioned. This game was available on Compuserve and during game play the magic word PLOVER had to be used. Past sysop of Plover-NET included Eric Corley, under the pseudonym Emmanuel Goldstein, and Lex Luthor, the founder of the notorious hacker group Legion of Doom. Quasi-Moto personally recounted the creation of Plover-NET, > I met Lex in person while we lived in Florida during the Fall of 1983 after > corresponding via email on local phreak boards. I was due to move to Long > Island, New York (516 Area Code) soon after and asked him about starting up > a phreak BBS. He agreed to help and flew up during his Christmas break from > school in late December 1983. We worked feverishly for a couple of days to > learn the GBBS Bulletin Board software which was to run on my Apple with a > 300 baud Hayes micoSLOWdom %micromodem% and make modifications as necessary. > The system accepted its first phone call from Lex in the first week of > January 1984 and it became chronically busy soon after. Legion of Doom Lex Luthor, under the age of 18 at the time, was a COSMOS (Central System for Mainframe Operations) expert, when he operated Plover-NET. At the time there were a few hacking groups in existence, such as Fargo-4A and Knights of Shadow. Lex was admitted into KOS in early 1984, but after making a few suggestions about new members, and having them rejected, Lex decided to put up an invitation only BBS and to start forming a new group. Starting around May 1984 he began using is position on Plover-NET to contact people he had seen on Plover-NET and people he knew personally who possessed the kind of superior knowledge that the group he envisioned should have. He was never considered to be the \\"mastermind of the Legion of Doom\\", more the cheerleader and recruiting officer. 2600 Luthor met 2600 Magazine editor, Emmanuel Goldstein on the Pirates Cove, another 516 pirate/phreak BBS. He invited Goldstein onto Plover and it wasn't long before it became an 'official' 2600 bbs of sorts. When a user logged off the system, a plug for 2600 was displayed with their subscription prices and addresses. Operations The Board initially ran on three Apple disk drives with 143 K byte capacity. After a few months of operation, New York hacker Paul Muad'Dib appeared at a TAP meeting being held at \\"Eddies\\" in Greenwich Village with a RANA Elite III disk drive in hand. The RANA Elite III had a capacity of about 600 KB which put the total storage capacity of the BBS to just over one Megabyte, fairly large for a phreak board in those days. They gladly accepted the donation but did not ask how he obtained the disk drive. The RANA was later passed on to Lex which he used to house his extensive collection of phreak philes that were available to Legion of Doom BBS users. The location of the overworked RANA is currently unknown although Lex believes he sent it back to Muad'Dib around 1986. In early 1985 Plover-NET officially closed permanently after Quasi-Moto moved back to Florida and was unable to gain traction in re-establishing the bulletin board when he put it back up after moving.

Life Born in London on 28 February 1814, he was the son of Lyon Falkener, head of the ordnance department in the Tower of London. He was educated at a private school in Kent, and after declining a nomination for the civil service of the East India Company on the ground of delicate health, he was articled to the architect John Newman (1786‚Äì1859). He became a student of the Royal Academy in 1836, and in 1839 gained its gold medal for a design for a cathedral church. In 1842 Falkener started on a tour of most of the countries of Europe, on through Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, and visiting some of the Greek islands. He made studies of the architectural remains in the various places he visited. While in Denmark he made sketches of the palace of Frederiksberg; it was burned in 1859 and Frederick VII of Denmark asked for Falkener's original drawings, to support restoration work; the king in acknowledgment made him a knight of the Order of the Dannebrog. In 1847, while he was at Pompeii, he was allowed to excavate, at his own expense, the \\"House of Marcus Lucretius\\", a plan and description of which was given in his Museum of Classical Antiquities. The Greek inscriptions he collected during his travels were edited in 1852 by Wilhelm Henzen. Falkener practised as architect for a few years, building some offices on St. Dunstan's Hill, London E.C., and subsequently made alterations to his house at Glanymor, Laugharne, Carmarthenshire; but spent most of his time on writing and making drawings of restorations. From 1851 to 1855 he edited the Museum of Classical Antiquities. His drawings were exhibited in Paris at the Exposition Universelle, 1855, and gained him the grande m√©daille d'honneur, and in 1861 he was presented with another gold medal by the king of Prussia, for his works on classical arch√¶ology. In 1866 Falkener married, gave up private practice, and retired to Wales; but he continued studies and restorations to the time of his death, at Glanymor on 17 December 1896. He was a member of the Academy of Bologna, of the Architectural Institutes of Berlin and Rome, and was elected honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects on 2 December 1895. Works Floor plan of the Artemision of Ephesus, from Edward Falkener, Ephesus, and the Temple of Diana (1862) In 1839 Falkener published Was the Ceiling of the Parthenon flat or curved?. He wrote on lighting for museums of sculpture, and the artificial illumination of churches and mosques. He was a supporter of the lighting of Greek temples by the hyp√¶thron, in opposition to the views of James Fergusson and Wilhelm D√∂rpfeld, and published On the Hyp√¶thron of Greek Temples (London, 1861). Some of the illustrations in Fergusson's History of Architecture were by him, and many of his sketches were published in the Architectural Publication Society's Dictionary. Falkener published also: * D√¶dalus; or, the Causes and Principles of the Excellence of Greek Sculpture, London, 1860. * Ephesus and the Temple of Diana, 1862. * Games, Ancient and Oriental, 1892. * As E.

Writings  = Kant and the Mind = Kant and the Mind was first published in 1994 by Cambridge University Press: in 1996 a paperback edition appeared. As Brook notes in the preface, Kant and the Mind was written for two audiences. First, cognitive scientists, philosophers of mind, and students of cognition. Second, Kant scholars. The book thus has two parts: the first four chapters provide an overview of Kant's model of the mind for general audiences. The second part, written primarily for Kant scholars, attempts to justify the reading given in the first four chapters. Brook emphasizes in the book that Kant had something to offer contemporary psychology, cognitive science and philosophy of mind. he writes, \\"I think that the discoveries he made about the mind not only were a contribution in their time, but continue to be important now.\\"Brook, A. (1994). Kant and the Mind, p. 1 Brook attributes the following discoveries to Kant: 1) the mind has the ability to synthesize a single coherent representation of self and the world. 2) The mind has a unity that is necessary to produce representation. 3) The mind's awareness of itself has unique features stemming from the semantic apparatus that it uses to achieve this awareness. He also suggests that three of Kant's insights have been adopted by cognitive science: the transcendental method (inference to the best explanation), that experience requires both concepts and percepts; and his general picture of the mind as a system of concept-using functions for manipulating representations.Brook, A. (1994). Kant and the Mind, p. 14 He explains that Kant distrusted introspection as a means of revealing the structure of the mind, yet also had deep reservations about Cartesian a priori arguments. The theory of mind that Brook finds in Kant is not based on either approach, but instead explores what powers the mind must have in order to have experiences and representations that it has. Brook distinguishes four kinds of awareness, two of which are also kinds of self-awareness: simple awareness (awareness of an object without being aware of being aware), awareness with recognition, awareness of one's representational states and awareness of oneself as the subject of one's representational states.Hogan, M. Review of Kant and the Mind in The Review of Metaphysics, 49 (1996) He divides the latter into empirical self-awareness (being aware of one's own mental states) and apperceptive self-awareness (ASA) (being aware of oneself as the subject of those states).Stevenson, L. Review of Kant and the Mind. The Philosophical Quarterly, 45, 351-354. ASA is not awareness of oneself as an object with properties; rather, ASA is a bald reference to oneself as existing as oneself. One need not ascribe to oneself any properties whatsoever. If Brook's reading of Kant is correct, then Kant discovered ASA 200 years before contemporary theories.Howell, R. Review of Kant and the Mind. Mind, 105, 491-495 (1966) In addition to these distinctions, Brook writes that Kant thought the mind is not merely the subject that has representations, but is itself a representation. (\\"The mind, the self, the understanding, the thing that thinks not only has representations; it is a representation.\\")Brook, A. (1994). Kant and the Mind, p. 233 Not only is the mind a representation under this reading, but it is what Brook calls a global representation (the result of synthesis of a multitude of representations into a single intentional object). Brook argues that treating the mind as a global representation removes any risk of a homunculus problem (Hogan, 1996), and further argues that this global representation is the representational base for ASA. Reviewing the book, Stevenson wrote in The Philosophical Quarterly, \\"I venture the judgement that this will be recognized as one of the most important books ever on Kant However, Eric Watkins in the Journal of the History of Philosophy raised concerns about the literature Brook cited and the more controversial interpretations: \\"Brook neglects almost entirely the relevant German scholarship on Kant's theory of mind, in the form of work by G. Prauss, W. Carl, M. Frank, G. Mohr, B. Thole and D. Sturma\\" (Watkins, 1995, p. 3).Watkins, E. Kant and the Mind. Journal of the History of Philosophy, 33, 524-525. Watkins further criticize Brook's claims that one can be aware of the mind as it is and that the mind is a global representation, since the latter directly conflicts with Kant's view that the noumenal self is immaterial, not a representation.Other reviewa: Kitcher, P.

The second part focuses on the metaphysics of mind, as well as free-will. The third discusses knowledge of mind, naturalism and how epistemology and philosophy of mind should resonate in cognitive science.Reviews: Staudacher, Alexander (2003). \\"Review: Knowledge and Mind: A Philosophical Introduction by Andrew Brook; Robert J.

The L.A.W., a national organization for cyclists, was founded in 1880 and actively defended the rights of cyclists until 1902, when the League became dormant. In the 1930s, Dick Wilson, a bicycle industry representative, invited members of the Evanston Bicycle Touring Club to become the first chapter of the inactive L.A.W. Harmon, age 19, joined and immediately began recruiting new members. After learning that three clubs could come together and form a council, she encouraged the Rambler Cycle Club and Oak Park Cycle Club to join with the Evanston club to become the first council in the League. Harmon continued promoting the benefits of membership to bicycle riders all over the country, helping the L.A.W. to become, once again, a national organization. After the war, the proliferation of automobiles and narrow highways left little room on the roads for bicycles. Bicycling was no longer safe or fun, so the League became inactive again in 1955. Harmon served the organization in every conceivable role as volunteer, office staff, historian, treasurer, executive vice president, and interim executive director (a position she held for four years). She also served as editor of the League's monthly bulletin for more than thirty years, singlehandedly producing and editing the magazine on a green IBM Selectric typewriter. When the League offices moved to Baltimore in 1979, Phyllis retired from her position as editor. The League's then president, Pete Kutschenreuter, said, \\"During her tenure as our editor, neither rain, snow, Saturdays, broken wrist, dog bite, or illness kept her from getting out our Bulletin at press time.\\" For much of the League's history, Harmon has been called \\"the heart and soul of the League\\" as well as \\"the League's Most Valuable Player, a combination of Lance Armstrong, the Energizer Bunny, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, and Winston Churchill, all rolled up into one indomitable spirit.\\" Harmon died in August 2016 at the age of 99.  Advocacy  During her career as an advocate, Harmon held the following positions: * Writer and Editor of the L.A.W. Bulletin. * American Bicyclist Magazine Editor Emeritus * League of American Wheelmen Secretary * League of American Wheelmen Treasurer * League of American Wheelmen Office Administrator * League of American Wheelmen Executive Vice President * League of American Wheelmen Historian * League of American Wheelmen Board of Directors * Director Emeritus on The League of American Bicyclists Board of Directors * Founder of the Wheeling Wheelmen * Founder of the Chicagoland Bicycle Federation (now the Active Transportation Alliance) * Advisory role with the Chicagoland Bicycle Federation, providing advice on how to structure the new organization, publish a newsletter and get the word out about bicycle laws and safety issues. * Illinois Bicycle & Pedestrian Safety Advisory Committee Member  Honors  * In 1979, Harmon was awarded the Dr Paul Dudley White Award, the League of American Wheelmen's top national award, honoring individuals who are an \\"inspiration to others for his or her commitment to the future of bicycling and to significant progress in education, safety, rights, or benefits of bicycling\\". * In 1985, the League of American Wheelmen established the Phyllis Harmon Volunteer of the Year Award to recognize individuals who have made extraordinary contributions to bicycling. * In 2005, she was listed as number 12 in the League of American Bicyclists' Top 25 Change Agents for Cycling, honoring \\"25 people who indelibly changed the face of cycling in America.\\" * In 2006, Harmon was inducted into The Chicagoland Bicycle Federation Hall of Fame. * In 2009, Harmon was inducted into the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame and is currently the oldest living member. * In 2013, Harmon traveled to Wheeling, Illinois for the dedication of the Phyllis Harmon Bicycle & Pedestrian Path, an integral connection between two long-established bike trails.

Yalecrest is commonly referred to as the renowned \\"Harvard-Yale area\\" and many streets are named after Ivy League or major U.S. universities. It is a remarkably visually cohesive area with uniform setbacks, historic houses of the same era with comparable massing and landscaping, as well as streets lined with mature shade trees, and a surprising level of contributing structures that retain their historic integrity. Yalecrest contains 1,487 homes that were built in the early 20th century starting as early as 1912 with the vast majority (74%) built during the period of 1920‚Äì1940. The remaining homes in the easternmost part of the neighborhood were built during the post war boom. Yalecrest has the largest concentration of period revival English Cottages, English Tudors, French Norman and Spanish Colonial homes anywhere in Utah. These houses exhibit a variety of period revival styles with the largest portion being English Tudor and English Cottage. According to the Salt Lake City Planning Department, the architectural variety and concentration of period cottages found in Yalecrest are \\"unrivalled in the state.\\" Examples from Yalecrest are used to illustrate period revival cottages styles in the only statewide architectural style manual. There are 22 subdivisions which were platted and built by the prominent architects and developers of the day responsible for early 20th Century east side Salt Lake City development. . Yalecrest has been on the National Register of Historic Places since November 8, 2007. One home in the neighborhood, the George Albert Smith home at 1302 Yale Avenue, is listed on the National Register since 1993. The first home built in Yalecrest was at 882 South 1400 East in 1912. In those days, Yalecrest was an unsettled area perched against a beautiful rolling hillside that gradually rose in elevation to 4,000 feet above sea level. To the East are panoramic views of the towering Wasatch Mountains, to the West are sweeping vistas that encompass Salt Lake's broad Valley, Utah's West Desert and the Oquirrh Mountains as well as downtown Salt Lake City. A tributary of Red Butte Creek meanders gently through the northwest quadrant creating a shaded gully that has since become a popular park with two mini-amphitheaters. The area also encompasses three churches belonging to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), three commercial buildings, one school and two parks. In its early years and in subsequent periods, Yalecrest has been a haven for the well-to-do along with prominent professionals, business executives, church leaders, writers and those in the arts and sciences Early history The property that is now Yalecrest was distributed by the LDS church authorities by lot for use in raising crops and farming. Dividing the plots for land speculation was discouraged. The earliest identified residents in the Yalecrest area begin to appear in the 1870s. A ten-acre plot belonging to Gutliffe Beck was located near Yalecrest between 1700 and 1800 East. His early 1870s adobe farmstead was located near the intersection of Yalecrest Avenue and 1700 East. The property was later used as a dairy farm. Paul Schettler's farm, situated near the intersection of 1900 East and Herbert Avenue had crops that included silk worms and mulberry orchards. David Lawrence had twenty acres of alfalfa located to the south of the Schettlers. On Sunnyside between 1800 and 1900 East, Jim Carrigan built a house c. 1876 and farmed forty-five acres. A one- legged man named Wheeler lived at what is now 1372 Harvard and got his culinary water from Red Butte Creek. No remnants of these early homes are known to remain. A number of factors contributed to the Yalecrest area development in the early twentieth century. The population of Salt Lake City increased rapidly at the turn of the century, almost doubling from 1900 to 1910. Air pollution from coal-burning furnaces as well as early industry in the valley added to the smoke-filled air of Salt Lake City, particularly in the winter. Properties on the east bench above the steep grade that flattens at 1300 East above the smoky air of the city began to look attractive for residential development. Land developers from Utah and out-of-state sensed economic opportunity in the potential urban growth, began to purchase land on the east bench and early subdivision advertising touted the clean air of the bench, above the smoke of the valley. Transportation options made the Yalecrest area easily accessible to the downtown area. The primary means of transportation in the early part of this era was the streetcar and the line along 1500 East serviced Yalecrest commuters to downtown Salt Lake City. The streetcars serving the Yalecrest area traveled from downtown to 1300 East in front of East High, south along 900 South to 1500 East, then south to Sugar House and the prison.

Both Woolley and Romney were residents of Yalecrest. * Yalecrest Ward - The Art Deco Yalecrest Ward Chapel at 1035 South 1800 East was built in 1936 of exposed reinforced concrete. * Bonneville Ward - The Bonneville Ward which is at the East Side Entrance to Miller Park was built in 1949. Land that was previously Miller Park was used for construction of the Bonneville Ward Chapel and Stake. Its red brick Postwar Colonial Revival style building was designed by Lorenzo Snow Young and constructed by the Jacobsen Construction Company in 1949. Bonneview Drive was originally a private drive owned by the LDS Church to access the property but was later made a public street. Parks * Miller Park - Miller Park follows the course of Red Butte Creek on both sides of its ravine and was originally a 9-acre ravine that extended from 900 South to 1500 East but now stops at Bonneview Drive as a land swap in 1945 gave the southern section of Miller Park to the LDS Church in exchange for property that became Laird Park, located on 1800 East between Laird and Princeton. Miller Park is named for Lee Charles and Minnie Viele Miller that lived at 1607 Yalecrest. After Lee Charles death in 1930 Minnie Miller donated 2 acres of property in his memory along both sides of Red Butte Creek to the city and along with city property and property acquired from the Herrick Construction Company and became known as the Lee Charles Miller Park. * Laird Park - Laird Park is located on 1800 East between Laird and Princeton Avenue was created in 1945. Commercial buildings * Duffin's Grocery Store - Duffin's Grocery Store was built in 1925 at 1604 Princeton and was run by Clarence Duffin in conjunction with William Wood & Sons meat market. Duffin's was the only market within Yalecrest and designed to have the same setback and blend in with the surrounding houses. Duffin's Grocery was renamed Princeton Market before being turned into a hair salon \\"Princeton Hair Fashions\\". This property has now been turned into a personal residence but retains its historic charm. * Currently there are 3 commercial buildings in Yalecrest. At 1700 East and 1300 South is a restaurant called Sea Salt that shares the building with a retail clothing boutique and spa. Another restaurant located near it is \\"Eggs in the City\\". There is a small coffee shop, Java Joe's, located at 1300 East and 900 South. Schools * Uintah Elementary School was constructed in 1915 to support the growing elementary school age population of the East Bench. It was built encircled by vacant land but was soon filled to capacity with the rapid growth of the surrounding residential sections. The school was enlarged in 1927 and in 1995 the original school was torn down and a new one built in its place. Preservation There is no current zoning protection in place for the Yalecrest Neighborhood. National Register status does not prohibit demolitions or out of character remodels. According to the 2007 National Register of Historic Places designation (based on a 2005 survey), 91% of the neighborhood's 1,487 structures have been identified as significantly contributing to the historic district. However, the neighborhood is experiencing a teardown rate of up to 6 houses per year. Starting in 2010 the neighborhood is experiencing escalated rates of teardowns primarily from developers wanting to capitalize on the location and beauty of the district. The teardowns and overscaled rebuilds and additions discourage neighbors and create animosity on the block. According to the Utah Heritage Foundation, Yalecrest has the largest number of demolitions of any area in the State of Utah since the early 2000s. The creation of a Local Historic District would provide zoning that would curb demolitions and out of scale remodels, however there is no current protection in place. In 2013, a non-profit group called Yalecrest (Keep Educating and Encouraging Preservation) was formed to work with residents in addressing the demolitions and out of character remodels that are destroying the historic nature of Yalecrest.

History California Central Railway - Santa Fe 1888 rail map The California Central Railway built and ran a line from Port Ballona (what is now Playa del Rey, Los Angeles) to Redondo Junction, the line opened in September 1887. The line ran 13 miles. Redondo Junction became a major maintenance facility for trains. California Central Railway also ran a line from Redondo Junction to Los Angeles-La Grande Station. The Redondo Beach Railway also connected to Redondo Junction. The Redondo Beach Railway was incorporated in April 1888, Henry E. Huntington controlled and owned much of the Redondo Beach Railway. Redondo Beach Railway line started operation on September 1, 1888. California Central Railway operated on, but did not own, the 11 miles of the Redondo Beach Railway. This line ran from Redondo Beach to Inglewood, California. In 1890, the Hotel Redondo opened, the rail line help make Redondo \\"The Place\\" for Tourists.

The Pacific Surfliner still runs on this line from San Diego to Santa Ana. *On November 7, 1889, California Central Railway was consolidated into Southern California Railway Company. On June 30, 1888, it started operation as a subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. In 1914 Santa Fe built in Redondo Junction a 25-track roundhouse to service trains. The railway turntable was a 120-foot through plate girder design. * The Redondo Junction was sold to Amtrak in January 1977. In May 1999, Amtrak built new train service facility just north of the original 1914 roundhouse. The 1914 roundhouse was demolished in August 2000 to make space for a future servicing area.

After he recovered, he was ordered to serve on the corvette , which was transferred to the Royal Norwegian Navy and was outfitted in Belfast before the ship was put into escort service in the Atlantic convoys. In 1942 Rist also took courses and received training as a commando. In May 1943 he moved to MTB Flotilla in Shetland. Rist was on four trips to occupied Norway, before he later in 1943 was back again in service on Eglantine. From February 1944 Rist was in preparation for Operation Overlord, and in June 1944 he participated in the Normandy landings. Under the alias \\"Otto Borgen\\" Rist was in December 1944 appointed Secretary at the Norwegian legation in Stockholm. From Sweden Rist participated in the Polar Bear expeditions, a series of operations aimed to secure Norwegian ports during an invasion or German withdrawal. Early in 1945 Rist served as Head of Polar Bear 1, where the goal was to protect the port of Narvik. The Unit operated from a Sepalis base in Sweden. During a mission across the border to Norway Rist and other participants were discovered by a German patrol on 13 April 1945 and engaged in a fire-fight. The fight went in Norwegians favour and three Germans were killed. After the fire-fight Rist and his companion made their way back across the border to Sweden. On the basis of this effort Rist was on 20 September 1946 awarded the War Cross \\"for outstanding efforts during the execution of special mission.\\" Postwar Rist was working for the establishment of naval force of the Home Guard (Norway). In 1951 Rist led the nation's first Naval Home Guard courses in Reine, Lofoten.Fra Nord-H√•logaland HV-distrikt 15's historie\\" publisert 1996, redakt√∏rer Petter Agersborg, Bjarne Johnsen, Harald Storkenes, og Roy Fjellgaard He was since then often called the Naval Home Guard father. He was head of the Naval Coast Guard in northern Norway. In March August 1966 he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander for special service in the Navy and in March the following year came the appointment to lieutenant commander. On 19 December 1969 was Rist promoted to Commander. Honours and awards In addition to the *War Cross with sword - received Rist several other Norwegian and British awards. Rist was awarded the Norwegian War Medal, the Medal for Heroic Deeds in silver,'Admiral Horve overrekker ung handelsskoleelev fire milit√¶re utmerkelser', Aftenposten, morgenutgaven 24 May 1946, s. 6 the Defence Medal 1940‚Äì1945 with Rosette, and the Haakon VII 70th Anniversary Medal from Norway as well as the 1939-1945 Star, the Atlantic Star with clasp, and the Defence Medal from Britain.

Recruited from London working men, it sent volunteers to the Second Boer War, saw extensive service on the Western Front during World War I, and defended the United Kingdom as a searchlight regiment during World War II. Origins Machine gun of the 3rd London Rifle Volunteers, c1895 An invasion scare in 1859 led to the creation of the Volunteer Movement in Britain. One of the movement's leaders was the journalist, playwright and poet Alfred Bate Richards, who convened a meeting at St Martin's Hall, Long Acre, London, on 16 April 1859 that led the War Office to authorise the recruitment of Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs). Richards himself enlisted 1000 men to form the 'Workmen's Volunteer Brigade'.Beckett, pp. 19, 61, Appendix VI, pp. 277‚Äì8.Planck, p. 2. Although the unit began holding parades at the City of London's Guildhall in the autumn of 1860,Morning Advertiser, Times, 24 Sep; Volunteer Services Gazette, 29 Sep; Bengal Hurkaru 31 Oct 1860. the first officers' commissions were not issued until 26 April 1861, when the unit was formally adopted as the 3rd City of London RVC. The men were generally less well-off than some other London RVCs recruited from the professions and middle classes, but the unit received some financial support from the City of London and the Livery Companies. It adopted a scarlet uniform with buff facings and brass buttons, at first with a bearskin and red plume, later with a kepi, together with the motto LABOR OMNIA VINCIT (Work conquers everything) derived from Virgil.Becket, Appendix VII.Frederick, pp. 214‚Äì5.Planck, pp. 2‚Äì3.Westlake, p. 161.7th City of London Regiment at Regiments.orgBarnes, Appendix III.Ehrlich. Under the Childers Reforms the RVCs became Volunteer Battalions of Regular Army regiments on 1 July 1881. The 3rd London RVC was designated as the 11th Volunteer Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC) but continued to use its former title and did not adopt the Rifle green uniform and black buttons of the KRRC.Martin, pp. 1, 4‚Äì5. The battalion did not have its own drill hall, and drill parades were held at Regent's Park, the Ditch of the Tower of London and at Gray's Inn Square. Prize-givings and inspections were held in the Guildhall, and the annual inspection was carried out at Horse Guards Parade. Church parades were held at St Bride's Church, Fleet Street. The headquarters was first at 26 Great Tower Street, then 38 New Broad Street, both in the city, and afterwards at 76 Farringdon Road in Clerkenwell, but in 1903 the battalion raised enough money to obtain larger premises at Sun Street, Finsbury Square.Planck, pp. 8‚Äì10. During the Second Boer War the 3rd City of Londons provided a contingent of the City Imperial Volunteers raised at the Guildhall after the events of Black Week, and volunteers from the battalion also served with the KRRC. For this the unit received its first Battle Honour: South Africa 1900‚Äì02.Planck, pp. 8‚Äì9. Territorial Force Under the Haldane Reforms that created the Territorial Force in 1908, the battalion was included in the new all- Territorial London Regiment, taking its place as the 7th (City of London) Battalion. It was assigned to 2nd London Brigade in the 1st London Division.Frederick, pp. 149‚Äì50.James, pp. 113‚Äì6.Planck, p. 11.Martin, p. 6‚Äì7.Barnes, Appendix IV.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 141‚Äì7. Unlike many battalions of the London Regiment the 7th Battalion had no traditional name, but was nicknamed the 'Shiny Seventh' because it wore brass buttons in a brigade whose other battalions all wore black Rifle buttons. World War I =Mobilisation= The battalion had just arrived in camp at Eastbourne for annual training on Sunday 2 August 1914 when news reached them of the mobilisation of the Continental Powers. The battalion immediately entrained for London and the men returned to their homes. Mobilisation came on 5 August. The men were accommodated in Curtain Road and Scrutton Street schools, the transport in Broad Street Goods Yard, and the officers at the Armfields Hotel. A week later, the Commanding Officer, Viscount Hood, asked if the men would volunteer for foreign service, and practically the whole battalion did so, making it eligible to be sent overseas.Planck, p. 12. The men who did not so volunteer, or were unfit, were constituted as a second battalion to which the new recruits were directed. This was named the 2/7th Londons, the service battalion becoming the 1/7th Londons under the command of Col Edward Faux, a long-serving officer of the regiment. In April 1915 a reserve battalion, named 3/7th Londons, was organised to train and supply drafts to the other battalions serving overseas.London Regiment at Long, Long TrailLondon Regiment at Regimental Warpath Planck, pp. 83, 143, 217.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 9‚Äì15. =1/7th Battalion= In the weeks following the outbreak of war the 1/7th was marched to training camps at Bisley, Surrey, Crowborough, Sussex, and finally Watford, Hertfordshire, where it joined the 4th London Brigade in 2nd London Division. 1st London Division had been temporarily broken up as a number of individual London TF battalions had already been sent overseas, and the 2nd London Division was being brought back up to full strength in order to proceed to France as a formation. The 1/7th spent the winter of 1914‚Äì15 at Watford and then entrained for Southampton, disembarking at Le Havre on 18 March 1915.Planck, 12‚Äì7.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 69‚Äì75. Festubert The 2nd London Division, soon afterwards numbered 47th (1/2nd London) Division, went into the line near B√©thune to be instructed in trench warfare by Regular troops, the 1/7th carrying out working parties and suffering its first casualties.Planck, pp. 18‚Äì9.Maude, pp. 12‚Äì7. After holding a section of the line near Festubert in early May, the battalion became the first in the 47th Division to go into action. As the left hand unit of the division it was temporarily attached to the neighbouring 22nd Brigade of 7th Division, which attacked on 16 May during the Battle of Festubert. Elements of the battalion advanced as far as the German support line, but found themselves ahead of their flanking troops and returned to hold the captured German front line. Their casualties that day were 23 killed and 128 wounded.Planck, pp. 21‚Äì6.Maude, pp. 19‚Äì20. Loos The Battle of Loos 1915 British infantry advancing through a gas cloud at Loos, 25 September 1915 After spending the summer holding the line near Loos, the battalion was withdrawn for intensive training for the forthcoming Battle of Loos. This was a carefully rehearsed attack that began on 25 September 1915 following four days of bombardment and the release of a gas cloud. The battalion's first objective in this attack was a mining Spoil tip known as the Double Crassier, then it was to move on to take the German second line about 400 yards further on. The battalion followed the gas and smoke cloud and successfully captured its objectives. It then consolidated the position and beat off a counter-attack. Casualties for the day were heavy, totalling 14 officers and 250 other ranks.Planck, pp. 31‚Äì43.Maude, pp. 26‚Äì31.Cherry, pp. 113‚Äì7. Vimy During the winter of 1915‚Äì16 the 1/7th Londons carried out regular tours of duty in the Loos sector. losing a steady stream of casualties to artillery and mine attacks.Planck, pp. 44‚Äì54.Maude, pp. 37‚Äì47. In March 1916 the 47th Division took over part of the Vimy sector on the west side of the Vimy Ridge. On 21 May 140 Bde (temporarily under the command of Col Faux of the 1/7th) was subjected to a heavy bombardment, and the Germans attacked in the evening. The weight of the attack fell on 1/7th and 1/8th Londons, who were forced back from their front and support lines halfway down the slope. 1/7th made a local counter-attack, but it was too weak to succeed. After a night and day of confusion, the 1/6th and 1/7th Bns pushed forward 250 yards to reoccupy an old French trench which they consolidated and thereby prevented any further enemy advance. They were relieved in the evening of 22 May, having suffered heavy casualties.Planck, pp. 57-71.Maude, pp. 49‚Äì56.Cave, pp. 58‚Äì63. High Wood The 47th Division's attack at High Wood, 15 September 1916 In late July 1916 the 1/7th marched south to begin training to enter the ongoing Somme offensive. The battalion practised on positions marked out by flags, and adopted identification stripes on their arms: A Company blue, B Co green, C Co red and D Co yellow. On 15 September, 47th Division attacked High Wood to cover the left flank of the tank-led attack of the adjacent divisions on Flers. The first objective for 140 Bde was a line clear of High Wood (the Switch Line), the second was the Starfish Line on the forward slope, and then the strong Flers Line. The 1/7th and 1/15th were to open the attack, after which the 1/8th would pass through to capture the Starfish Line and finally the 1/6th would pass through and continue to the Flers Line. The 1/7th advanced rapidly behind a creeping barrage and took over 100 prisoners, but suffered severe casualties in taking the Switch Line and consolidating just in front of it. The battalion was relieved on the evening of 17 September and moved forward to relieve the 1/8th in the Starfish Line, where they were counter-attacked and bombarded for two days. By the time they left the line on 20 September the 'Shiny Seventh' were caked in mud and had suffered over 300 casualties. The regiment was awarded the battle honour Flers- Courcelette.Planck, pp. 75‚Äì82.Maude, pp. 61‚Äì8. Butte de Warlencourt In rest camp the battalion was reinforced by a draft of nearly 200 troops from the East Surrey Regiment and returning wounded men of the 7th. It then returned to the High Wood sector on 5 October for another general attack, this time with little preparation. Thebattalion was to attack through the 1/8th Londons (Post Office Rifles) and seize the objective, a mound known as the Butte de Warlencourt. At first casualties were light, but after some 300 yards the leading waves reached the skyline and were virtually wiped out by machine- gun fire. The survivors dug in as darkness fell, with the nearest supports some 600 yards away. After a day under shellfire the battalion was withdrawn the following night. Casualties had been another 300 officers and men. This action won the regiment the battle honour Le Transloy.Planck, pp. 83‚Äì90.Maude, 71‚Äì3. Ypres The 47th Division transferred to the Ypres Salient, at that time a quiet sector, and the 1/7th received a draft from the 25th (County of London) Cyclist Battalion, who had spent the whole war so far in England and were unusually well trained.Planck, pp. 91‚Äì113.Maude, pp. 79‚Äì94. For several months the battalion did tours of duty in the line in the area of Hill 60 and 'The Spoilbank'. This was part of the line being prepared for the Battle of Messines, and the troops were carefully trained for this set-piece attack. After the explosion of huge British mines on 7 June, the task of 1/7th was to attack from the Spoilbank, take the German front lines and then swing round to capture the 'White Chateau'. The attack broke through with little opposition, but was held up at the White Chateau. The 1/6th Londons then passed through and the two battalions enveloped and captured the position. The captured area was consolidated and held despite shelling and German counter- attacks. Over three days the battalion suffered 64 officers and men killed, 275 wounded and 13 missing.Planck, pp. 114‚Äì7.Maude, pp. 95‚Äì100. On 15 September a 60-man party of the battalion, after special training, made an afternoon attack on a troublesome German strongpoint in front of the 'Clapham Junction' position. This had held up several previous attacks but the 1/7th Londons took it, naming it 'Cryer Farm' after 2/Lt B.N. Cryer who was killed leading the attack. The position was reinforced during the night and held off three counter-attacks before the battalion handed over the sector to Australian troops on 16 September and left the Salient.Planck, pp. 125‚Äì7.Maude, p. 109. Bourlon Wood On 29 November 1917 the 47th Division took over defence of Bourlon Ridge, captured during the recent Battle of Cambrai. The defences were rudimentary, and the Germans attacked the following day, accompanied by a heavy bombardment and ground attack aircraft. 1/7th had been occupying Kangaroo Trench, a support line; that night they moved up through a sunken road into the front line, and attacked the following morning: 'the opposition was not very severe and the attack resulted in fifty- two prisoners and eighteen machine-guns being captured and the line advanced between three and four hundred yards'.Planck, p. 133. However, casualties had once again been heavy, and the line was later abandoned as the division pulled back to a more defensible position.Planck, pp. 130‚Äì7.Maude, pp. 124‚Äì34. In February 1918 a number of British infantry battalions were disbanded because of a manpower crisis. 1/7th Londons was among these. Battalion HQ and 200 men selected from pre-war Territorials and those who had served longest with the battalion were drafted to the 2/7th Battalion (see below). A large draft (14 officers and 375 men from A, B and D Companies) went to reinforce the 1/19th Londons in 141 Bde of 47th Division, and five officers and 140 men of C Company went to the 1/7th Middlesex Regiment in 56th (1st London) Division. The remaining men of the 1/7th were sent to join remnants of nine other battalions to form 6th Entrenching Battalion.Planck, pp.140‚Äì2, 183.Maude, p 145.'Entrenching Battalions', The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 95/5494/1. =2/7th Battalion= The 2/7th Londons formed on 31 August 1914 was rapidly recruited, and marched to Burgess Hill in Sussex on 19 November 1914 to begin training. Uniforms were issued soon afterwards, but rifles remained scarce for some time. Later, Japanese .256-inch rifles were issued, and these remained in use for training until 1916. The battalion made three moves during 1915: first to Crowborough, then to Norwich in April, and finally to Ipswich on 19 June. The 2/7th Bn had been assigned to the 2/2nd London Brigade of 2/1st London Division (later renumbered 174th Bde and 58th Division respectively) and the division concentrated around Ipswich in Spring 1915, forming part of First Army, Central Force (Home Defence). In Spring 1916 it took over coastal defence duties in the area.Planck, pp. 143‚Äì4. The 2/7th Bn remained at Ipswich for 13 months, and during that time sent over 800 NCOs and men to reinforce the 1/7th Bn in France, while training new recruits to replace them. Later the practice stopped, as 58th Division was prepared for overseas service, and 3/7th Bn took over training duties. In July 1916, 58th Division left its coastal defence role and concentrated at Sutton Veny for final training on Salisbury Plain. On 26 January 1917, the battalion entrained at Warminster for Southampton Docks, where it embarked for France, landing at Le Havre the following day.Planck, pp. 145‚Äì9. Bullecourt On 8 February the battalion went into the line for the first time, at Monchy-au-Bois and Ransart, south of Arras. This was considered a quiet sector, and the 2/7th were introduced to trench warfare by the 1/5th and 1/6th Bns South Staffordshire Regiment of 46th (North Midland) Division.Planck, p. 151. On 5 May the battalion began training for a forthcoming attack, the Second Battle of Bullecourt. On the night of 18 May the 2/7th moved up into the second line behind the 2/6th Londons, who were to attack on the 21st. The attack was unsuccessful, and the 2/7th relieved the 2/6th the following night. 'A' Company was sent forward to clear a German trench, but were heavily shelled and subjected to German counter-attacks until 'B' Company advanced across the open to reinforce them. This successful action cost the battalion 120 killed and wounded.Planck, pp. 155‚Äì9. Ypres After a period of trench holding near Arras, the 58th Division moved to the Ypres Salient in late August 1917. In the attack of 20 September (the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge), the 2/7th was the reserve battalion of 174 Bde. After the leading battalions had taken Hubner Trench, the 2/7th followed through to Genoa Farm, where they suffered badly from German shellfire. After dark the 2/7th moved on to reinforce the line captured by the 2/6th, where the shelling was less intense. The following day the men had an unusual opportunity to cause heavy casualties with rifle and Lewis gun fire to Germans attempting to cross in the open to relieve their remaining positions, and then watch as a British barrage fell on German troops massing for counter-attack.Planck, pp. 165‚Äì75. Later in September the weather broke, and during the spells spent holding the front line of flooded craters in the Poelcappelle area the battalion suffered the full horrors of the Battle of Passchendaele.Planck, pp. 176‚Äì81. When the 1/7th Bn was disbanded in February 1918 (see above), its Battalion HQ and a draft of 200 long-service men were transferred to the 2/7th, which thereafter became simply the 7th Battalion. Surplus men of the 2/7th went to the 17th Entrenching Bn. Villers Bretonneux When the German Spring Offensive opened on 21 March 1918, 58th Division was positioned across the River Oise. Although 173 Bde was heavily attacked and forced back by the end of the day, 174 Bde south of the river was not attacked and remained in position until 26 March, when it was withdrawn, By 4 April, 7th Bn was in reserve positions at Bois L'Abbe, just in front of Villers-Bretonneux, the latest German objective. The battalion was not directly involved in the First Battle of Villers-Bretonneux, but on 18 April it was subject to an intense bombardment with Mustard gas shells and suffered heavy casualties, particularly to HQ, and had to be relieved. Again, the 7th Londons were not directly engaged in the Second Battle of Villers- Bretonneux but lost more men to shellfire and gas during the action, in which they witnessed the first tank versus tank action in history.Planck, pp. 186‚Äì91. Amiens For the opening attack of the Battle of Amiens on 8 August 1918, 174 Bde was given the initial objective of capturing Malard Wood. 6th and 7th Londons led the assault, with 8th Bn in support. The attack proceeded well, but all three battalions became mixed up. After reorganization on the first objective, the four companies of 7th Bn went forward and captured the ravine behind, and supplies were brought up by supply tank and dropped by aircraft. 173 Brigade had been unable to take their objective of Chipilly Eidge, so they took over the Malard Wood line to launch a second attack. On 9 August the 7th then made a hastily organised attack with tanks and American troops, which successfully cleared Chipilly Ridge and Gressaire Wood. Casualties had been heavy ‚Äì over two days the 7th lost 300 men ‚Äì but the results were excellent. After the Battle of Amiens, the battalion was reinforced with men from the Staffords and the Lincolns and began to train intensively for mobile warfare.Planck, pp. 197‚Äì202. The 7th Londons went back into action on 26 August, attacking towards Maricourt. The attack was a huge success, but the battalion again suffered heavy casualties from machine-gun and artillery rearguards. The 7th had advanced about 1,000 yards and held 'D' Copse, which enabled the neighbouring Australians to sweep up the valley. The following day the battalion attacked behind a barrage to take Maricourt.Planck, pp. 203‚Äì4. The Londons attacked at √âpehy on 8 September, finding the opposition stronger than expected and receiving many casualties. After a rest, the battalion attacked again in the same area on 18 September, still meeting strong resistance.Planck, pp. 206‚Äì7. After that, it was withdrawn for rest and reorganisation, returning to the line in early October in the Lens sector. Here the enemy had begun to retreat, attacks on 2 and 3 October went well, and thereafter the campaign became a pursuit across the Escaut River. When the Armistice came into effect on 11 November, the battalion was at Beloil in Belgium. The 7th Londons were then billeted at P√©ruwelz until demobilisation was completed in June 1919.Planck, pp. 209‚Äì16. =3/7th Battalion= The 3/7th Battalion was formed at Orpington in April 1915 under the command of Lt-Col Sir Pieter C. van B. Stewart-Bam, a South African soldier and politician who had been in charge of the London Recruiting District for the TF. The role of the 3/7th was to train and despatch drafts to replace casualties in the 1/7th and 2/7th (and later other units) serving overseas. Stewart-Bam used his connections to arrange with the Dominion High Commissioners in London for the battalion to act as a training unit for officer cadets from the Dominions and Colonies. During the war there were often 70 officers training with the Reserve Bn, at one time 37 were from South Africa alone. The battalion sent some drafts to the King's African Rifles serving in the East African Campaign.Planck, pp. 217‚Äì8. The 3/7th began training at Sun Street, then from September 1915 at a brewery at Orpington. In January 1916 the battalion moved to Fovant, where there was a large purpose- built camp on the edge of the Salisbury Plain training area. While quartered here, the men of the sister battalion the 3/6th Londons started a fashion by cutting their regimental badge into the turf of Fovant Down to reveal the white chalk beneath, making it visible from a long distance. A number of other battalions in the camp did likewise, including the 3/7th who cut theirs on nearby Sutton Down. The Fovant badges are now a Scheduled monument, but those on Sutton Down have not yet been restored.Godfrey, p. 81.'Unrestored Badges' at Fovant Badges Society The 3/7th Bn was redesignated 7th Reserve Bn London Regiment on 8 April 1916, and was assigned to the 1st London Reserve Group (later Brigade).TF Training Bdes at Warpath.org It left Fovant in January 1917 and moved to Dartmouth, Devon, and finally to Blackdown in April 1917, where it remained for the rest of the war training replacements and convalescents for service on the Western Front. It was disbanded on 22 August 1919. In total, 8631 men of all ranks passed through the three battalions of the 7th Londons, of whom 88 officers and 1430 other ranks died.Planck, p. 219. Interwar During the war the London Regiment had been disbanded and its battalions affiliated to Regular regiments. This was usually to their pre-1908 regiment, but the 7th was instead assigned to the Middlesex Regiment (Duke of Cambridge's own) (this corrected the anomaly of a brass-buttoned unit being attached to a rifle regiment). However, the battalions retained their titles as London regiments. When the renamed Territorial Army was reformed in 1920‚Äì22, the 8th Londons (Post Office Rifles) were not reconstituted but merged into the 7th, which became the 7th London Regiment (Post Office Rifles).Frederick, p. 217.Planck, p. 221.Martin, p. 16. Unlike some London units, which suffered slow recruitment in the postwar years, such as the 6th (City of London Rifles),Godfrey, p. 258. or the 13th (Kensingtons),Bailey & Hollier, p. 382. recruitment was brisk in the combined 7th, which was the strongest battalion in the reformed 56th (1st London) Infantry Division.Planck, p. 222. In 1935 the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence, particularly for London, was addressed by converting 47th (2nd London) Infantry Division into 1st Anti-Aircraft Division and reorganising a number of London Territorial infantry battalions into searchlight battalions of the Royal Engineers (RE). The 7th Londons became 32nd (7th City of London) Anti-Aircraft Battalion RE (TA) on 15 December 1935 and the Post Office Rifles name was discontinued.Martin, p. 17.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 108, 112‚Äì3.Litchfield p. 170. From now on private soldiers were referred to as Sappers. Despite transfer to the Royal Engineers, they continued to wear their 7th Londons cap badge.Regimental Badges. The battalion was assigned to 28th (Thames and Medway) AA Group with the following organisation, the company locations reflecting a broader recruiting area and the doubling of the size of the unit:Planck, pp. 225‚Äì6.29 AA Brigade War Diary 1939‚Äì40, TNA file WO 166/2250. * HQ at Sun Street, Finsbury Square, later at Napier House, Grove Park, Lewisham * 328th Anti-Aircraft Company at Finsbury Square * 329th Anti- Aircraft Company at Grove Park * 330th Anti-Aircraft Company at Grove Park * 331st Anti-Aircraft Company at Bexleyheath ‚Äì new company formed 1935 As the number of Territorial AA units and formations increased, they were grouped into Anti-Aircraft Command. In April 1939, 331 Company transferred to help form the new 73rd (Kent Fortress) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, RE.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files World War II =Mobilisation= 90 cm 'Projector Anti-Aircraft', displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The battalion was embodied and proceeded to its war stations on the north bank of the River Thames from Shoeburyness to Canvey Island with HQ at Purfleet. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Planck, p. 226.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. In June 1939, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of AA Command was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA gun and searchlight positions. 32 Searchlight Bn began moving in June 1939, with 330 Company, followed by 328 in July and 329 in August, completing a deployment to Laindon, Southend-on-Sea, and adjoining parts of Essex. However, this scheme was altered in August and the equipment placed in readiness at Hadleigh. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371.Planck, pp. 226‚Äì7. 32 Searchlight Bn was deployed with HQ and 329 Company at Framlingham, 328 Company at Bildeston and 330 Company at Saxmundham. The battalion mobilised as part of 29 (East Anglian) AA Brigade, but by the end of September it had come under the command of 41 (London) AA Brigade in 2 AA Division The equipment was modern 90-centimetre searchlights with early pattern sound locators.Planck, p. 228.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378. =Battle of Britain= The first months of the war were quiet, but on the night of 7/8 June 1940 the battalion was the first searchlight unit to bring down an enemy aircraft, the crew of a Heinkel He 115 coastal reconnaissance aircraft being dazzled by a detachment at Rendelsham and crashing nearby. On the night of 18/19 June a strong night air raid crossed the coast at Harwich and flew through the battalion area. Many of the aircraft were illuminated and seven were shot down by Spitfires, one flown by Sqn-Ldr Adolph Malan, even though the day fighters had no other detection equipment.Planck, pp. 228‚Äì30. In July 1940, the battalion was transferred from 41 AA Bde to 6 AA Brigade, which had originally been created to command the AA units in the Norwegian Campaign.Routledge, p. 109.Farndale, p. 27. After the evacuation of British forces from Norway it reformed in 2 AA Division as a light AA brigade in southern East Anglia, commanding widely spaced S/L sites and LAA guns scattered at VPs, mainly Royal Air Force airfields in Essex; the brigade soon afterwards came under 6 AA Division. The battalion's companies were controlled by the Operations Room at RAF Debden.Planck, pp. 230‚Äì3.Farndale, Annex D, p. 258.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396. On 1 August 1940 all the RE searchlight units were transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA), and the battalion became 32nd (7th City of London) Searchlight Regiment, RA (TA) in August 1940; Sappers were retitled Gunners, and Companies became Batteries.Frederick, pp. 858, 862, 865.Planck, p. 231.32 S/L Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45Farndale, Annex M, p. 339. =The Blitz= In September 1940 the main night-bombing campaign against London and the cities of the United Kingdom (The Blitz) began, and cooperation between searchlights and RAF night-fighters as well as AA guns became increasingly important. Anti-Aircraft Command was rapidly increased in size. Existing regiments provided cadres to help train new units: 32 S/L Regiment sent three such cadres to establish new batteries, and between September and November 1940 ran a Regimental Training Centre at Brandeston Hall to provide initial training for 400 new recruits. 32 S/L Regiment sent a cadre of experienced officers and men to 231st S/L Training Rgt at Blandford Camp, where they formed a new 562 S/L Bty from 1914 recruits on 17 April 1941. 562 S/L Battery joined the regiment on 15 July 1941. The new battery completed its training at Brettenham Hall.Planck, pp. 231‚Äì2. The S/L layouts had been based on a spacing of 3500 yards, but due to equipment shortages this had been extended to 6000 yards by September 1940. In November this was changed to clusters of three lights to improve illumination, but this meant that the clusters had to be spaced 10,400 yards apart. The cluster system was an attempt to improve the chances of picking up enemy bombers and keeping them illuminated for engagement by AA guns or Night fighters. Eventually, one light in each cluster was to be equipped with searchlight control (SLC) radar and act as 'master light', but the radar equipment was still in short supply.Routledge, pp. 388-9, 93. =Mid-War= 6 AA Division formation badge. By October 1941 the availability of SLC radar was sufficient to allow AA Command's S/Ls to be 'declustered' into single-light sites spaced at 10,400-yard intervals in 'Indicator Belts' along the coast and 'Killer Belts' at 6000-yard spacing inland to cooperate with the RAF's night fighters.Routledge, pp. 399‚Äì400. In late 1941 the battalion began to receive SLC-equipped 90-cm searchlight projectors to replace sound locators. These required relocation of some sites to obtain best results. Early in 1942 the regiment shifted some of its sites southwards, including parts of Essex, with 328 Battery based at Felixstowe, 330 Battery at Manningtree, from where it covered Shotley Royal Naval Training Establishment (HMS Ganges) and the Harwich Naval Base, and 562 Battery covering Colchester and Chelmsford. These three batteries came under the control of RAF North Weald Operations Room. Regimental HQ also moved to Manningtree. Part of 328 Battery's duties was to provide 'Canopy' for RAF Martlesham Heath, where a cone of searchlights over the airfield assisted homing aircraft. This duty ended when the US Eighth Air Force took over Martlesham Heath. The regiment also provided 'Canopy' for RAF Wattisham in the spring of 1941.Planck, pp. 231‚Äì4. By May 1942, the regiment was still under the command of 6 AA Bde, but 328 and 330 Btys were attached to 27 (Home Counties) AA Bde defending London. In June these two batteries switched to 56th Light AA Bde in 6 AA Division. By October, the whole regiment was under the command of 56 LAA Bde, though 329 Bty was still attached to 6 AA Bde.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82. =Later War= The radar equipment, and larger 150-centimetre searchlights, gave increasingly successful results with Heavy AA guns and in cooperation with the new generation of RAF night fighters. 32 S/L Regiment usually cooperated with 85 Squadron flying Havocs and later Mosquitos from RAF Hunsdon and 29 Sqn and the New Zealand 488 Sqn flying Mosquitos from RAF Bradwell Bay. Low-flying attacks by German fighter-bombers were often engaged by Light AA guns and by the searchlight detachments themselves with twin Vickers machine guns.Planck, pp. 234-7. As the air defence battle was being won, men began to be withdrawn from AA Command to provide manpower for 21st Army Group in the Invasion of Normandy. Many roles such as plotters, drivers and telegraphists in 32 S/L Regiment were taken over by women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS), freeing able-bodied men for other duties, while 562 Battery was wholly disbanded in early 1944.Planck, pp. 236‚Äì8.Routledge, p. 409. From July to August 1944 the regiment was actively engaged in assisting operations against V-1 flying bombs (Operation Diver), many of those crossing the East Anglian coast having been launched from aircraft over the Dutch Coast.Planck, p. 238. After VE Day, 32 S/L Regiment staffed release centres at Oxford and Reading, Berkshire to administer the demobilisation process. Regimental HQ, which had been reduced to a cadre at Derby as a holding unit, was placed in suspended animation in 1946. Postwar When the Territorial Army was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, the regiment reformed as 567 Searchlight Regiment RA (7th City of London) (TA), with its HQ at Shoreditch, forming part of 75 AA Bde. In March 1949 it was redesignated 567 (Mixed) Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight Regiment, RA (TA) ('Mixed' indicating that some of the personnel were drawn from the Women's Royal Army Corps). When AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955, the regiment was merged into 265 Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA, becoming 'P' (7th City of London) Battery.Frederick, p. 1022.564‚Äì591 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.67‚Äì106 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947. Successor units still occupy Grove Park and Bexleyheath drill-halls, as 265 (Home Counties) Air Assault) Bty in 106th (Yeomanry) Regiment Royal Artillery, and 265 (Kent and County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters)) Support Squadron in 71 (City of London) Yeomanry Signal Regiment, Royal Corps of Signals. Both units strive to continue and maintain the traditions and history of their predecessor Regiments. The Regimental and Association standards are displayed along with a Regimental memorial plaques within The Army Reserve Centre, Baring Road, Grove Park, London SE12 0BH. Also Regimental silver for both the 7th and 8th (City of London) Battalions, other items of Regimental Property including the standards for the Temple Bar and St Paul's Association, the Third Regiment of Loyal London Volunteers and a painting of the Duke of Clarence and Avondale presented by King George V. These can be viewed by prior appointment. Old comrades still parade at Grove Park for their remembrance service every year. 265 (Home Counties) Battery, 106th (Yeomanry) Regiment, Royal Artillery History Battle honours The regiment was awarded the following Battle honours (those in bold indicate the honours chosen to appear on the Regimental Colours):Planck, Appendix B, p. 243. South Africa, 1900‚Äì1902 Aubers; Festubert, 1915; Loos; Somme 1916 '18; Flers-Courcellette; Le Transloy; Bullecourt; Messines, 1917; Ypres, 1917; Menin Road; Passchendaele; Cambrai, 1917; Avre; Villers Bretonneux; Amiens; Albert, 1918; Bapaume, 1918; Hindenburg Line; Epehy; Pursuit to Mons; France and Flanders 1915‚Äì18. After the 1922 merger with the Post Office Rifles, that unit's honour Egypt 1882 was added. The RA and RE do not receive battle honours, so none were awarded to the regiment for its service during World War II. Honorary Colonels In 1860, Alfred Bate Richards invited Maj-Gen William Ferguson Beatson of the Bengal Army to be the 3rd London RVC's honorary colonel. Beatson was in London in connection with a court case and had been supported by Richards and the Radicals in a series of high-profile disagreements with the War Office. Beatson took the salute at a parade in the Guildhall on 22 September 1860, but was under orders to return to India and was unable to accept the role permanently. The following served as official Honorary Colonels of the regiment:Planck, Appendix A, p. 243. * Sir William de Bathe, Bt (1861‚Äì68) ‚Äì first CO of 3rd London RVC'Planck, Appendix G, p. 258. * Field Marshal Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala, GCB, GCSI (1868‚Äì90) * Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, KG, KP, ADC (1890‚Äì92) * Colonel R.P.

Regimental memorial plaques within The Army Reserve Centre, Baring Road, Grove Park, London SE12 0BH. Traditions The regiment claimed descent from the Yellow Regiment of London Trained Bands, the Temple Bar and St Paul's Association (1798‚Äì1802) and the Third Regiment of Loyal London Volunteers (1803), but these units had been disbanded long before. In 1914‚Äì18 the regiment adopted the former slow march of the London Trained Bands, My Lady Greensleeves, as its quick march, replacing Austria (to the same tune as Deutschland uber Alles), which had been used until then). The Regimental Colour presented in 1909 repeated the device of the Temple Bar & St Paul's Association (a depiction of the West Front of St Paul's Cathedral).Planck, pp. 1‚Äì2, 219, Appendix B, p. 243. After conversion to Royal Artillery, the regiment in 1941 adopted a shoulder flash in the 7th Londons' colours of scarlet and buff on a black background, superimposed with the gold grenade bearing the number 7 of the regimental badge.Planck, p. 232.

Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 London John Murray 1926 Vol. 1 p.166 Despite his professional eminence, he was guilty of \\"an extraordinary career of crime\\" which stretched over nearly thirty years. When the charges against him were eventually proved, he was removed from the Bench.The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1386-1411 J.S. Roskell, L. Clark, C. Rawcliffe editors 1993 He belonged to a landowning family based at Escalls near Land's End in Cornwall.Foss, Edward The Judges of England London Longmans 1851 Vol.4 p.66 He was a qualified advocate, but also became notorious as a law-breaker. Along with his associates John Trevarthian senior (died 1395), and his son John Trevarthian junior (died 1405) he was for many years one of the principal disturbers of the peace in Cornwall. What was later described as his \\"remarkable career of crime\\" began about 1370.History of Parliament In 1383 he was indicted in Surrey for his role in the murder of Richard Eyre, a fellow Cornishman whose family had a long-standing feud with the Trevarthians.Ball p.166 The following year an arrest warrant on the charge of murder was issued for his apprehension, but was later withdrawn, apparently on the ground that he was not the principal in the murder.History of Parliament The list of serious crimes of which the Trevarthians were accused, and to which Penrose was an accessory, grew to a remarkable length: it included their private war with the Eyre family, which had resulted in the murder of Richard Eyre in 1383, as well as piracy, burglary and treason. In time however the Trevarthian family became both wealthy and outwardly respectable: at the time of his death in 1405 John Trevarthian junior was Sheriff of Cornwall.History of Parliament Despite his appalling criminal record, Penros was sent to Ireland as Lord Chief Justice in 1385. He returned without permission to England the following year and as a result was accused of misconduct.Ball p.166 Again he seems to have escaped serious censure, despite his reputation as \\"a notorious criminal\\". In 1391 he was appointed a justice of the King's Bench Some sources say the Common Pleas, but Foss believed that the King's Bench was more likely- Judges of England p.66 and became justice of South Wales in 1393. He was a trier of petitions in the House of Commons of 1394,Foss p.66 but was eventually removed from the Bench on the ground of his record as a notorious criminal (meanwhile the career of his accomplice John Trevarthian junior was still flourishing).History of Parliament Penros married firstly Joan, daughter of Richard Carnver, who died about 1391, and secondly, in about 1395, Constance, of whom little is known. By Joan he had at least two sons,History of Parliament William and John; John is said to have been an \\"imbecile from birth\\". Penros died in 1411.His date of death is given according to the History of Parliament. Elrington Ball, the great authority on Irish judges at this period, gives a much earlier date of death, but may be confusing his political downfall with his death.

The building is near the Estadio Mario Filho, which is at risk of demolition by the state government of Rio de Janeiro state government. The controversy surrounding maintenance of the village fed popular political movements in the city, and the village is considered symbolic of opposition to the government of S√©rgio Cabral Filho. Maracan√£ Stadium was the main stadium for the 2016 Summer Olympics, and Maracan√£ was the name of one of the four zones of the Olympic Village. Background The building was constructed in 1862 by Dom Lu√≠s Augusto. In 1910 it was donated to the Funda√ß√£o Nacional do √çndio, a state agency which sought to preserve Brazil's indigenous culture. The agency, founded that year, was led by C√¢ndido Rondon. The building was the federal agency's original headquarters. From 1953 to 1977, Darcy Ribeiro converted it into the Indian Museum. The museum was then transferred to Botafogo, and the building was abandoned. In 2006 the site was occupied by a group of about 20 indigenous settlers, who called the area the Maracana Village. The site was purchased by the Rio de Janeiro government in August 2012. To ease exiting Stadium Maracan√£ for the 2014 World Cup, the Old Indian Museum, the Municipal School Athletic Stadium Friendenreich and Celio de Barros would be demolished. The proposed demolitions were controversial. According to the government, the museum demolition was required by FIFA and the property had no historical value. In response, in 2013, three councilors proposed a bill to register the building. Its proposed demolition was criticized, and it was speculated that its purpose was for the construction of a large parking facility. Minister of Culture Marta Suplicy asked Rio de Janeiro governor Luiz Fernando Pez√£o for permission to maintain the building, and in January 2013 the municipal council for the protection of cultural heritage gave its unanimous support. That month, after the Indians obtained an injunction preventing the demolition, the state government agreed not to demolish the building until the local Indians left; the building would be renovated and kept intact. There was no timetable or decision about the building's ultimate fate, and the proposed settlement was rejected by village leaders. On March 22, 2013, the Maracana Village was occupied by the police and the Indians withdrew. Protests by a number of social and political groups followed, and state representative Marcelo Freixo (who was tear gassed) criticized the police action. A Femen activist was arrested when she exposed her breasts in protest.

She \\"rejected both the extremes of nonobjectivity and photographic exactitude,\\" choosing instead to use a range of sources that included photographs, live models, and her own sculpted life studies. Early life and education Born Shirley Fishman in Brooklyn, New York, she attended Abraham Lincoln High School. Her teacher, Leon Friend, arranged for guest lectures by commercial and fine artists. Shirley Fishman had the opportunity to study with three of them: Chaim Gross, Moses Soyer, and Raphael Soyer. Gross influenced her early sculptural work, which features squat figures with thick limbs. While attending Brooklyn College, where she earned her B.A. in 1944, she met Leonard Gorelick (1922‚Äì2011), a fellow student. They married in 1944 and shared an enthusiasm for art and culture. Leonard Gorelick was an orthodontist and later a collector of cylinder seals. He combined his interests by investigating the authenticity of cylinder seals through the use of dental technology, especially electronmicroscopy. Shirley Gorelick earned an M.A. at Teachers College, Columbia University in 1947. That year, she studied for several weeks with Hans Hofmann in Provincetown. For a short time in the late 1950s, she was a student of the painter Betty Holliday and, in the early 1960s, learned printmaking in the Long Island studio of Ruth Leaf. Early work (1945‚Äì1965) By the mid-1960s, Shirley Gorelick had worked in various media, including painting in oils and acrylics, intaglio printmaking, drawing in silverpoint, and sculpting in terracotta, stone, and wood. She initially explored a variety of artistic styles and was influenced by Cubism, Surrealism, Expressionism, and Abstract Expressionism, but became uncomfortable with the modernist distortion of the human figure and began a return to realism. In 1959, her focus turned to expressively rendered female nudes, often seated or reclining, which were painted with loose, fluid brushstrokes that allowed her to liken the body to a landscape. Responding to her first solo exhibition, at the Angeleski Gallery on Madison Avenue in 1961, Stuart Preston commented on the \\"impressive warmth\\" of Gorelick's nudes while noting that \\"form is abstracted and played around with such lavish complexity as almost to defeat its own ends as figure depiction.\\" By 1965, she was reimagining canonical works of art, including Pablo Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) and Giorgione's Concert Champ√™tre by recasting the figures as more lifelike studio models. Her Homage to Picasso I (1965), for example, uses nude models with real volume instead of rendering them in Cubist facets. Realist work (1965‚Äì1995) Between 1967 and 1969, Gorelick created a series on the theme of the Three Graces but represented ordinary, mature, and finally African-American women in place of the traditional, idealized European nudes. This led her to focus on a Black model named Libby Dickerson (1921-1995), who appears alone, doubled, and with her interracial family in a series of paintings and etchings that were completed between 1970 and 1974. Dickerson and her family are portrayed informally and illuminated with by strong light source. When the works were exhibited at SOHO 20 Gallery in 1975, the art critic John Perreault enthusiastically remarked, \\"There is a classical humanism going on here. For her subjects live. They puncture the 'picture plane' with their eyes and their lives. She has invented the palette for black skin, sorely needed.\\" Gorelick's Willy, Billy Joe, and Leroy (1973), a portrayal of three African-American men standing in the artist's studio with The Family II (1973) as a backdrop, was also praised by art critics. As inspiration, Gorelick continued to draw upon earlier artists, including Paul C√©zanne, Paul Gauguin, and Johannes Vermeer, but her realist works synthesized her sources and modern subjects more completely. As the feminist art movement gained momentum, Gorelick was a founding member of Central Hall Artists Gallery (est. 1973), an all-women, artist-run gallery in Port Washington, New York. She also joined SOHO 20 (est. 1973), a women-only and specifically feminist cooperative gallery in New York. Though not one of the founding artist-members of SOHO 20, her tenure with the gallery began in 1974, at the start of the second season. Between 1975 and 1986, Gorelick had six solo exhibitions at SOHO 20 and participated in numerous group shows. Gorelick's next series, Three Sisters (1974‚Äì77), depicts a trio of sibling models who range from seventeen to twenty-one years of age, robed and nude, in a leaf- patterned garden. They are far more individualized than the figures in her works of the early 1960s. Described by one reviewer as a group of \\"flabby teenagers who are ... the products of leisurely, suburban living,\\" Gorelick's unidealized figures were meant to reveal psychological states, with varying degrees of pain, questioning, anger, and confusion communicated by nuances of position, gesture, or facial expression. As described by Lawrence Alloway in 1977, Gorelick's work had taken on \\"a new lyrical undercurrent. This comes through most fully in a large painting of 'Three Sisters', each one of whom appears twice, once nude, once loosely robed. Thus three become a crowd, but the echoes of paired likeness and familial resemblance imply a pattern of kinship. The girls, all posed toward the spectator, stand in a garden, ankle deep in leaves, against an overgrown wall.\\" In 1976, Gorelick painted a nine- foot portrait of Frida Kahlo for The Sister Chapel, a feminist collaboration by thirteen artists which celebrated female role models. Gorelick appropriated a number of elements from Kahlo's own paintings, as well as photographs that were taken of the Mexican painter. By this time, Gorelick's work was recognized for her use of \\"all sources of information,\\" including photos, models, and xeroxes, \\"to get as close to the core of her subjects as possible.\\" In 1977, Gorelick turned to representations of middle-aged couples, either together or individually, as in Gunny and Lee I (1977), The Barnetts (1979‚Äì80), and Dr. Joseph Barnett I (1981). The earlier series depicts Lee Benson (1922-2012), an academic and historian who wrote The Concept of Jacksonian Democracy (published in 1961), and his wife Eugenia, known as Gunny. Gorelick's portraits of the Bensons, including Gunny and Lee II (1979), were described in The New York Times as \\"dynamic visual experiences, made dynamic through well-crafted and provocative compositions. Miss Gorelick especially likes to group two people together, something she does with flair, demonstrating a strong psychological nexus between the two sitters.\\" Her slightly later series on the theme of middle-aged couples, begun in 1980, features Dr. Joseph Barnett (1926-1988) and Dr. Tess Forrest (1922-2009), both psychoanalysts. Gorelick's imperious Tess in a Blue Dress (Dr. Tess Forrest) (1980) shows the sitter in her office with a backdrop of books, \\"catching us with a gaze both shrewd and confident,\\" as one reviewer noted. In the portraits of the Bensons and Barnetts, the figures are over life-size, close to the viewer, and cropped. Gorelick's final series, begun in 1982, is a group of landscape paintings representing the Gorges du Verdon, which she was inspired to paint after a trip to the area. The paintings feature fragmentary glimpses of the vast landscape and \\"juxtapose cool hard granite, lush greenery and calm sky.\\" Works in public collections * Night Flowers (c. 1963-64), Housatonic Museum of Art, Bridgeport, CT * Three Graces I (1967), National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, DC * Self-Portrait in a Fur Hat (1968), Housatonic Museum of Art, Bridgeport, CT * Seated Figure (1973), Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, NY * Three Sisters III (1974), Hillwood Art Museum, Long Island University, C.W.

Produced alongside the Colt Second Model Ring Lever rifle (preceded by the First Model Ring Lever rifle, Samuel Colt's first manufactured firearm), the Model 1839 was the most popular longarm of the Patent Arms period. The Model 1839 Carbine is differentiated from Colt's Ring Lever rifles by the lack of a cocking ring lever and the presence of an external hammer, which, when manually cocked, would rotate the six-shot cylinder to the next position. Approximately 950 Model 1839 Carbines were manufactured, and an additional shotgun variant, the Model 1839 Shotgun, was produced from 1839 to 1841 with approximately 225 manufactured. Though the United States Navy and Texas Navy purchased a number of Model 1839 Carbines, sales suffered due to the gun's high price and quality control issues. Overview A patent of the Colt Model 1839 Carbine The Model 1839 Carbine features a standard round barrel with a browned finish. The other metal parts are blued. Although the 24-inch barrel length is most common, and lengths were produced. The overall length of the 24-inch carbine is and the weight of the firearm is . Unlike Colt Ring Lever rifles, the Model 1839 Carbine features a smoothbore barrel that is chambered in .525 caliber. The six-shot cylinder features an elaborate roll scene including depictions of a naval battle, the Battle of Bunker Hill, and a hunter with lion. The front and rear edges of the cylinder were originally square, though by late production, the rear cylinder edge was rounded. Loading levers affixed to the right side of the frame were not present on early models, becoming standard during mid-production in August 1840. The stock is varnished walnut and the buttplate features a rounded heel. The trigger guard on the Model 1839 Carbine is an oval in shape and features a \\"rearward spur\\" that continues along the bottom of the stock a short distance before curling back forming a small open circle. The Model 1839 is distinguished from the larger Ring Lever rifles by the lack of a ring lever in front of the trigger guard and the presence of an external hammer. Cocking the external hammer back rotates the cylinder to the next position. =Model 1839 Shotgun= The Model 1839 Shotgun is similar in appearance and operation to the Model 1839 Carbine. The shotgun features a or Damascus barrel. The six-shot cylinder is long and features a roll scene which includes depictions of \\"the American eagle, a deer-hunting sequence, and an Indian with bird hunters.\\" The shotgun is chambered in 16 gauge, (.62 caliber) and lacks an attached loading lever. =Refurbished models= These models, which were original Model 1839 Carbines reacquired and refurbished by Colt in 1848, feature unadorned polished cylinders and case hardened furniture. In other aspects, these refurbished models are similarly finished to the original production run Model 1839 Carbine. Forty carbines were refurbished by Colt in this way. Production In 1838, production of the Model 1839 Carbine began in the Patent Arms Manufacturing Company's factory in Paterson, New Jersey. Production lasted until 1841, with a total of about 950 firearms produced (serial numbers 1‚Äì950). Model 1839 Shotguns were manufactured from 1839 to 1841, with between 225 and 262 guns produced (serial numbers 1‚Äì225 or 262). Approximately twenty- five variants of the Model 1839 Carbine were manufactured at some point during Patent Arms' tenure that featured an elongated cylinder. These models were produced to accommodate a larger musket-sized charge of powder. Reception and use Numerous Model 1839 Carbines were sold to several military organizations, though they were never adopted in any widespread manner. The Texas military was a major customer for Colt's new repeating weapons, purchasing several orders of the Model 1839 Carbines. The Texas Army purchased fifty carbines on August 3, 1839 for $55 each and an additional thirty carbines on October 5, 1839. Each order included accessories to the guns, such as ball molds and loading levers. Also in 1839, the Texas Navy ordered 180 of Colt's Model 1839 Carbines. The United States Navy purchased 360 carbines between 1840 and 1841 via four separate orders. These firearms were marked \\"WAT\\" by military inspector Captain William Anderson Thornton. Tests conducted by the Navy demonstrated the delicacy of the carbine after only 160 carbines had been delivered by mid-1841. In 1841, Captain Edwin Vose Sumner conducted field trials with the Colt Model 1839 Carbine and the Jenks Carbine at Carlisle Barracks in Pennsylvania. Sumner's early tests of the two carbines led him to favor the Jenks, which he found to be \\"twelve rounds quicker than the Colt's carbines\\". Ultimately, Sumner found the Colt Model 1839 Carbine to be inadequate for military service. Over time, it was found that the cylinders of the Colt Carbine began to corrode due in part to material issues. This caused small holes to develop between the chambers that enabled chain fires to occur. Despite the Model 1839's improvements in operation over Colt's Ring Lever rifles and high regard by Samuel Colt, the carbine failed to fulfill Colt's expectations. In addition to some of the aforementioned quality control problems, the carbine's high price proved undesirable for many consumers leading to fewer sales than expected. The Model 1839 Carbine most likely saw action with the United States Marine Corps during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. The carbines saw action during Winfield Scott's Mexico City campaign beginning with the landings at Veracruz and continuing inland towards Mexico City.

The framework defines the domain and sub-domains for interoperability research and development in order to identify a set of pieces of knowledge for solving enterprise interoperability problems by removing barriers to interoperability. Existing interoperability frameworks Some existing works on interoperability have been carried out to define interoperability framework or reference models, in particular, the LISI reference model, European Interoperability Framework (EIF), IDEAS interoperability framework, ATHENA interoperability framework, and E-Health Interoperability Framework. These existing approaches constitute the basis for the enterprise interoperability framework. The necessity to elaborate the enterprise interoperability framework has been discussed in. Existing interoperability frameworks do not explicitly address barriers to interoperability, which is a basic assumption of this research; they are not aimed at structuring interoperability knowledge with respect to their ability to remove various barriers. The enterprise Interoperability framework has three basic dimensions: # Interoperability concerns defined the content (or aspect) of interoperation that may take place at various levels of the enterprise. In the domain of Enterprise Interoperability, the following four interoperability concerns are identified: data, service, process, and business. Interoperability concerns: data, service, process, and business # Interoperability barriers: Interoperability barrier is a fundamental concept in defining the interoperability domain. Many interoperability issues are specific to particular application domains. These can be things like support for particular attributes, or particular access control regimes. Nevertheless, general barriers and problems of interoperability can be identified; and most of them being already addressed, Consequently, the objective is to identify common barriers to interoperability. By the term ‚Äòbarrier‚Äô we mean an ‚Äòincompatibility‚Äô or ‚Äòmismatch‚Äô which obstructs the sharing and exchanging of information. Three categories of barriers are identified: conceptual, technological and organisational. # Interoperability approaches represents the different ways in which barriers can be removed (integrated, unified, and federated) Basic Approaches to Develop Interoperability The framework with its three basic dimensions is shown. Enterprise interoperability framework  Use  The Enterprise Interoperability Framework allows to: * Capture and structure interoperability knowledge/solutions in the framework through a barrier-driven approach * Provide support to enterprise interoperability engineers and industry end users to carry out their interoperability projects. The enterprise interoperability framework not only aims at structuring concepts, defining research domain and capturing knowledge, but also at helping industries to solve their interoperability problems. When carrying out an interoperability project involving two particular enterprises, interoperability concerns and interoperability barriers between the two enterprises will be identified first and mapped to this Enterprise Interoperability Framework. Using the framework, existing interoperability degree can be characterised and targeted interoperability degree can be defined as the objective to meet. Then knowledge/solutions associated to the barriers and concerns can be searched in the framework, and solutions found will be proposed to users for possible adaptation and/or combination with other solutions to remove the identified barriers so that the required interoperability can be established.

According to the Business Roundtable letter, a survey of chief financial officers and corporate treasurers \\"underscores the urgent need for the end-user provisions\\" in this bill because \\"eighty-six percent of respondents indicated the fully collateralizing over- the-counter (OTC) derivatives would adversely impact business investment, acquisitions, research and development, and job creation.\\" The letter concluded that the Business Roundtable \\"supports efforts to increase transparency in the derivatives markets and enhance financial stability for the U.S. economy through thoughtful new regulation while avoiding needless costs.\\" The group Americans for Financial Reform opposed the bill, arguing that \\"the legislation would place significant new barriers in the way of effective oversight of commodities and derivatives markets crucial to our economy, barriers not faced by any other regulatory agency.\\" Americans for Financial Reform charged that the bill would give financial industry interests more power over regulators and the ability to delay or prevent the CFTC from acting. The organization also charged that insufficient time was allowed for the public to review the legislation before the House Agriculture Committee voted on it.

Kid606's music is similar to the work of his friend and colleague Lesser, as well as hardcore and IDM acts such as Atari Teenage Riot, Autechre, Mr. Oizo, and Matmos. He is primarily inspired not by his electronic contemporaries, but by his love of the industrial music, death metal, and industrial metal of the 1980s and 1990s, particularly bands like Godflesh and Napalm Death. His music is known for its high tempo breakbeats and liberal use of noise and sampling, as well as its punk aesthetic, uninhibited genre-mixing, and irreverent sense of humor. However, he is equally adept at creating more serious tracks that often reside in the realm of ambient and glitch (\\"Parenthood\\" from Kill Sound Before Sound Kills You and the entirety of P.S.

The battle took place on the ice of the frozen Lake Bysj√∂n in the parish of Eda (Eda socken, V√§rmland) in V√§rmland, Sweden. The battle was part of the Torstenson War (1643-1645), known locally as the Hannibal Feud (Hannibalsfejden) between Sweden and Denmark-Norway. The Danish-Norwegian victory meant the invading army could potentially continue into V√§rmland and Dalsland. Introduction In the autumn 1643 Field Marshal Lennart Torstensson (1603‚Äì1651), by order of the Swedish Council of the Realm, led the Swedish army which was then embroiled in the Thirty Years' War into Danish Jutland, initiating the Torstenson War. To ease the military pressure in Denmark, Hannibal Sehested (1609‚Äì1666), Governor-general of Norway, began preparations for military operations against Sweden along the Norwegian border, from J√§mtland to Gothenburg. These operations, later called the Hannibal Feud, would force Sweden to divert forces from Denmark to defend the border. Carl Olaf B√∏ggild Andersen (1946) Hannibal Sehested: en dansk statsmand (Universitetsforlaget i √Örhus) In January 1644, orders were sent to the governors of the Swedish border counties to establish beacons and frontier guards to defend the border. The county governor of V√§rmland, Colonel Olof Stake (1593‚Äì1664) , was ordered to keep 100 men posted on the border. When the local farmers saw the bonfires lit or heard church bells ringing, they were to gather at predetermined locations. On the road between the Norwegian parish of Vinger in Hedmark (near present-day Kongsvinger) and Karlstad in V√§rmland, the border was fortified by building a redoubt at Morast near present-day Charlottenberg during the winter and spring of 1644. On the Norwegian side of the road corresponding preparations with beacons and redoubts at Magnor and Midtskog in Hedmark. Sehested also pushed for the equipment of a standing Norwegian army, which was formally established in 1641 but whose six regiment were not fully trained. In 1644 the size of the Norwegian army grew, and in November Sehested attacked V√§rmland with 4,480 men and 18 cannon. Preparing for battle The redoubt at Morast was captured quickly on 18 November without losses on either side. The commandant and crew were taken prisoner. The Norwegians remained at Morast until mid-December. The Swedish side took advantage of this time by felling trees across roads, to hinder the approaching soldiers. The winter road over the frozen Lake Bysj√∂n was obstructed by cutting up the ice across the lake between the villages By and Vittensten. The sawn ice was used to build a breastwork, giving the Swedes a strong defensive position. The defense was led by Captain Lorentz Hansson of the N√§rke-V√§rmland Regiment. C.O.Munthe (1901) Hannibalsfejden 1644-1645. Den norske haers blodd√•b (Kristiania: Gr√∏ndahl) On 17 December the Norwegian force left Morast and marched south to Eda church, making camp at Hammar on the north shore of Lake Bysj√∂n. On 19 December Norwegian infantry marched out on the ice while the cavalry attempted to get around both sides of the lake. Skirmishes took place throughout the day both at the felled trees and on the ice. With minor losses on either side, the Norwegians fell back when darkness fell. The battle Map of the area of the parish of Eda circa 1700 Early in the morning on Sunday 22 December, the Norwegian soldiers under the command of Sehestedt marched out on the ice again. The Swedish forces were estimated to be about 4000 infantry and cavalrymen, as well as 5 or 6 cannon. The local farmers were at the opening in the lake ice, with two companies of cavalry and a few hundred Finnish soldiers on their flanks. The left wing was standing at Skogslund on the western shore of the lake, while the right wing was on the eastern shore, where steep cliffs plunged into the water. The Norwegians made repeated attempts to cross the opening with long boards, with no success. Their vulnerable position on the ice caused major Norwegian losses. At sunset, a number of factors made it possible for the Norwegian soldiers to break through. The Swedes were running out of bullets and gunpowder. Some of the defenders cut out the tin buttons of their clothes to use as bullets. Captain Hansson, who commanded the Swedish left wing, took a bullet in the shoulder and couldn't continue in command. The defending farmers became disordered and fled in different directions in the dark. A detachment of the Akershusiske Regiment commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Georg Reichwein (1593‚Äì1667) finally managed to get around and occupy a hill west of the lake, from which they could fire flanking fire at the Swedish barricade. A contemporary account described the sequence of events: \\"The Peasants had to save themselves by fleeing and each went home to his Home.\\" The Swedish cavalry east of the lake could not be used, and retreated southeastward to the parish of Frykerud ( Frykerud socken). The Norwegian soldiers made their night camp at the former Swedish cavalry pickets at By while others made camp at √Ömot (present-day √Ömotfors.) Aftermath Between 30 and 50 Swedes were killed during the battle. On the Norwegian side 60 wounded men were carried back to the Midtskog redoubt, and about 100 are estimated to have been killed due to their exposed position on the ice. The news of the defeat caused alarm in Sweden, and in a letter from Kyrkerud on 24 December, Olof Stake urgently requested reinforcements from Gabriel Oxenstierna, Lord High Steward of Sweden (1587‚Äì1640). Another letter from Berendt Olsson to an accountant Pederson in Karlstad on 23 December reads: \\"I don't know what to do. If help doesn't come soon, Karlstad and the whole country will be lost.\\" Sehested was proud of his victory, his first on the battlefield: > I myself have had the honor, of receiving from the soldiers of Olof Stake > for New Year, two bullets through the cap on my head, although without > injury. Sehested also wrote the way to Karlstad now lay open, and the between this city and Stockholm there were no troops. In Copenhagen, word spread that he already was on his way to Stockholm. In reality, his strength was too small, and he had to reckon with the risk of being cut off from Norway.

Smith Patel was a licensed and board-certified physician in California beginning in 2004. In 2005, she started DOC420, a pioneering practice that recommends medical cannabis (or medical marijuana) as an alternative to pharmaceutical drugs under California Proposition 215 (1996) (or the Compassionate Use Act).. She provided recommendations for marijuana on a fraudulent basis, for which she lost her license to practice medicine.  Early life and education  Patel, an Indian American, was raised along with her younger sister, Mona Patel, in Paramount, California. Patel's passion for Indian classical dance and modelling set the stage for her to win more than 20 talent and dance competition awards. Her modelling career reached a climax in 1994, when she was awarded Model Search India's title of Super Model India, as well as Miss Photogenic. With her newfound Bollywood popularity, Patel became actively involved in the Indian community to raise awareness for charities, giving birth to her philanthropic side. She graduated from Ruben S. Ayala High School in Chino Hills, California in 1994. In 1998, Patel earned a Bachelor of Science in Human Biology from University of California, Irvine. She then entered medical school at Ross University School of Medicine in the island nation of Dominica, where she earned a medical doctorate (M.D.) degree in 2002. Upon earning her M.D., Patel continued her education with post-doctoral training at Riverside County Regional Medical Center, a teaching hospital in Moreno Valley, California. During her residency, Patel also taught physician's-assistant courses as an adjunct faculty member at Riverside City College in Riverside, California.  Career  In 2005, Patel was certified as a licensed family-practice physician by the Medical Board of California. She started a free clinic in Los Angeles, California in 2005, gaining funding by the United States Armed Forces and the government of California. Patel's free clinic offered physical examinations, vaccines, birth control, emergency contraception, STD tests, and health screenings regardless of age, income, race, color, religion, disability, sexual orientation, marital status or health insurance. Patel also provided meals every weekend to underserved communities. = Medical Marijuana Practice = Given the constant controversy around the subject of marijuana, Patel was hesitant to get involved in the medical marijuana revolution. Having witnessed a few of her family-practice patients' success with medical marijuana treatment, she began researching the different uses and benefits of marijuana. After finding that patients often got greater relief from marijuana than from prescription drugs, and reported no side effects, she incorporated medical marijuana into her practice in 2005.Los Angeles Times, November 18, 2009, \\"Prescribing pot in high heels,\\" by Steve Lopez She tells CNN, \\"I strictly follow all of the laws ...\\"CNN \\"Easy to get medical pot in California\\" She has also become known for aggressively defending her patients,Green Acres Magazine, June 2012 often going to court to vindicate patients wrongly accused of crimes and serving as an expert witness. For additional assistance in legal matters, Patel consults with her sister, Mona Patel, an attorney known as \\"Lady Justice.\\"Above the Law December 2013 Patel is currently opening new offices in California, with aspirations to operate nationwide. She urges for reform in states that do not offer medical marijuana as an alternative medicine option. = Additional pursuits = Along with her medical marijuana practice, Patel is active in real estate, start-up investments, and is currently producing a line of cosmetics and clothing derived from hemp. Patel is also author of A Comprehensive Guide to Medical Marijuana,‚ÄúA Comprehensive Guide to Medical Marijuana‚Äù a book that further outlines the history of medical marijuana as well as her turbulent entry and struggles within the industry. = End of medical career = Dr. Patel's license to practice medicine was revoked for negligence and fraud in 2013. She provided recommendations for medical marijuana to undercover investigators on two occasions without performing an adequate evaluation, then lied about it. Initially, the license revocation was suspended and Dr. Patel was place on probation. However, she failed to comply with the terms of her probation by not maintaining an active license and by not practicing medicine for over two years. Her license was permanently revoked in 2020.

It is known as a leaning tower because the top of the tower is displaced from where it would be if the tower were perfectly vertical. Located on Pod KrzywƒÖ Wie≈ºƒÖ street, it is one of the most important landmarks in Toru≈Ñ's Old Town.  History  The Leaning Tower of Toru≈Ñ was built in the 13th century in order to defend the town. It was built of red brick. It started leaning because it was built on loamy ground. In the 18th century it ceased to be used for defensive purposes. The tower was then converted into a women's prison. In the 19th century, it housed a blacksmith's shop and an apartment for a gunsmith. At this time, the Gothic tented roof was replaced by a pitched roof. A souvenir shop and a caf√© used to be located in the tower in the 1970s and 80s, and now it houses the Toru≈Ñ Cultural Department and a caf√©, Krzywa Caffe.  Legends  Some legends are associated with the Leaning Tower of Toru≈Ñ, which are narrated by tour guides to visitors: * The sin of the Teutonic Knight: In the tower, there lived 12 knights of the Order of Teutonic Knights, who were forbidden to meet with women. However, one monk fell in love with the daughter of a rich merchant, and met her in secret, thus breaking the monastic rule of the Order. The residents of the town discovered this and reported them to the commander and the city authorities. Both lovers were fined, the woman was sentenced to 25 lashes, and the knight was ordered to build a tower. However, the tower had to be tilted, in the same way as his conduct had deviated from the monastic rule. To this day, legend has it that those who have sinned are not able to keep their balance under the tower. * Origin of the name of the city: According to another legend, the tower was a friend of the river Wis≈Ça, and loved listening to interesting stories told by the river. With time, the river started getting closer to the tower and eroding its walls, and the tower started leaning. The tower pleaded with the river to not flow so close to it, because it might fall down, but the river said, \\"So fall down, then!\\". The river's cries were heard by wanderers who wondered what was the city with high walls that they could see on the horizon, and they called the city Toru≈Ñ (which means \\"So fall down, then!\\", in Polish).

It covered the basin of Lake Erie, part of Lake Huron, including Saginaw Bay and the lowland, which separates Lake Huron from Lake Erie. It included a part of the Lake Ontario basin and the lowland between Lakes Ontario and Erie. Lake Warren included the Saginaw basin and the Huron-Erie basin. Its outlet was through the Grand River to Lake Chicago. The beach stands at above sea level west of the hinge line, unaffected by the isostatic rebound. It is marginally above the outlet, at . Lake Warren was preceded by a lower stage, which had its outlet through the Mohawk valley. Lake Warren came into existence its waters were raised from Lake Wayne by advancing ice front. The ice both compacted the area where the melt water could be held, raising the water level, while blocking the lower outlet from Lake Wayne.Chapter XIX, Glacial Lake Warren; Frank B.

Beach Summary of prehistoric beaches from the six glacial lakes that preceded the modern Lake Erie.The beach rises to the north of the Grand River outlet at per mile until it reaches near Gladwin. It is also nearly on the point of the \\"Thumb\\" in Huron county north of Bad Axe. The beach is horizontal from Lenox, in St. Clair county, around the west end of Lake Erie, then along the south shore through Ohio to the Pennsylvania line, a distance of . Between there and Batavia, New York, it rises in the next . The beach marks a lake level which lasted a considerable period of time, shorter than either the Arkona or the Lake Whittlesey durations. The delta deposits are not as extensive as Lake Arkona. Its shore deposits vary, where the lakebed was till or gravelly material, a gravelly beach was formed. Where the lakebed was sandy it is a sandy ridge. Lakes Warren and Wayne Map of Lake Warren in the Lake Huron and Lake Erie BasinsThe relatively strong but discontinuous multiple sand and gravel beach ridges occurring as close as 40 feet and as much as 100 feet below the Whittlesey strand line in western New York (between are correlated with Glacial Lake Warren. These ridges occur at the foot of the Allegheny Plateau. They are frequently associated with deltas. The ridges are well developed in a few areas well beyond the Plateau in the Lakes Erie and Ontario lowlands. In many cases, the ridges and deltas are underlain by silts of Lake Whittlesey lakebed.Strand Lines and Chronology of the Glacial Great Lakes in Northwestern New York; Parker E.

The northeast-southwest direction of the eskers north of Disko, Wabash County, and the southeast- northwest trend south of there indicated that the part of the Packerton moraine south of Disko was built by the Erie lobe and the part north of Disko by the Saginaw lobe. An esker, Miami County shows a northeast-southwest alignment, providing evidence that Packerton moraine in Miami County was built by the Erie lobe. A small area in the northwestern was deposited by the Saginaw lobe.The Geology of Miami County, Indiana; William D. Thornbury and Harold L. Deane; Indiana Department of Conservation Geological Survey Bulletin No. 8 ; 1955 It is named the Packerton moraine from the village of Packerton in Kosciusko County. Thirteen kames and eskers complexes are mixed with sand and gravel. The till is, sandier, especially in the part deposited by the Saginaw lobe, than in the lobe passed over some source of sand, whereas the Erie lobe did not. Water-laid or wind-blown sands are found throughout the moraine. The bulk of the sand seems to have been water-deposited, but locally the sand appears to have been reworked by the wind. Few of the sand deposits exhibit dunal forms. Description At its western end, near Delphi in Caroll County, the Packerton moraine is wide. It is on the north side of the Wabash River as far as Logansport, continuing along the north side of the Eel River. In Miami and Wabash Counties the moraine is wider and further from the Eel River, separated by a belt of outwash wide. Its hummocky topography shows numerous kames, eskers and lakes. The maximum altitude exceeds , and local relief exceeds . Only along the Wabash sluiceway is the relief greater. Till and water-laid sands and gravels occur together in rather complex relationships, and a few short eskers are associated with it in the northern part of the county. The largest, in reaches and forms a discontinuous eastwest ridge for about 2 miles. History During the Tazewell subage, the Wabash, Eel, and Mississinewa Rivers and their major tributaries served as sluiceways for the Saginaw or Erie lobes. Outwash that was deposited along the major valleys has not been distinguished from that laid down later during the Cary substage. Tazewell outwash is exposed, however, along such minor sluiceways as Mill, Big and Little Pipe, and Deer Creeks and three southward-f lowing tributaries of the Eel River, none of which served as sluiceways during the Cary substage. The Packerton Moraine in which Shoe Lake is located belongs to the moraines of the Saginaw lobe of late Wisconsin Substage. It has its origin in northern Carroll County, extends northeastward through Cass, Miami, Fulton, Kosciusko, and Whitley Counties, and terminates about the middle of Noble County. Here it joins with the Morainic system of the Erie Lobe. Shoe Lake is two miles southeast of Oswego.

His fresh and authentic reinvention of folksongs brought him prominence. The initial production was favored by theater progressives and opposed by theater purists. Art music blogs rediscovered and praised the musical 30 years after its initial release.  History  La Gatta Cenerentola is a Neapolitan Language, three-act musical adapted by from the sixth fable (Cinderella) of Giambattista Basile's Pentamerone. Its name translates as \\"The Cat Cinderella\\" or \\"Cinderella the Cat\\". It billed itself as a \\"musical fable\\" in three acts, told through villanelle, tarantella, and madrigal in a Neapolitan style. Its author sought to evoke the \\"dreamlike texture\\" of southern Italy's popular culture. De Simone, a composer and scholar, led a resurgence of the folk art tradition and public interest in 1940s folk singer-songwriters. He reinvented folksongs in a fresh yet authentic style in writing La Gatta Cenerentola, which, in turn, brought him prominence. The musical debuted on July 9, 1976, at the Teatro Nuovo in Spoleto, Italy's Festival of Two Worlds, where it included actress Isa Danieli and the folk band Nuova Compagnia Di Canto Popolare. It received its American premiere on October 19, 1985, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater during Italy on Stage in New York City. The two-day run was performed by the visiting troupe Ente Teatro Cronaca of Naples‚Äîthe oldest private theater company in southern Italy‚Äîdirected by De Simone, and produced by the Italian Government with assistance from the America-Italy Society as part of the city's Italian Cultural Month. Its British premiere was at the King's Theatre in the Edinburgh International Festival from August 24‚Äì27, 1988.  Reception and influence  The original production had mixed reception. It was favored by opera progressives and opposed by opera purists. Thirty years after the musical's debut, 20 Jazz Funk Greats wrote that its \\"Secondo Coro delle Lavandaie\\" (Second Chorus of the Washerwomen) had specifically influenced contemporary pieces by both OOIOO (especially Taiga) and 3rd Face's \\"Canto della Liberta\\".

Muslims and their property were attacked by Sinhalese Buddhists in the towns of Aluthgama, Beruwala and Dharga Town in Kalutara District. At least four people were killed and 80 injured. Hundreds were made homeless following attacks on homes, shops, factories, mosques and a nursery. 10,000 people (8,000 Muslims and 2,000 Sinhalese) were displaced by the riots. The riots followed rallies by Bodu Bala Sena (BBS), a hard line Buddhist group. The BBS was widely blamed for inciting the riots but it has denied responsibility. The mainstream media in Sri Lanka censored news about the riots following orders from the Sri Lankan government. Background Aluthgama Since 2012 there have been a number of attacks against Sri Lanka's Muslim minority by the majority Buddhists. Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) has engaged in various anti-Muslim campaigns. On Poson Poya (12 June 2014) Buddhist monk Ayagama Samitha and his driver were allegedly assaulted by Muslims in Dharga Town. A mob from Samitha's temple, together with the priest, stormed Aluthgama Police Station demanding that immediate action be taken. Three Muslims were arrested and remanded until 25 June 2014 by the courts. That evening a tense situation arose in Aluthgama as a group of Sinhalese Buddhists started protesting against the alleged assault. The protest turned violent and the mob started throwing stones at the police and attacking Muslim shops. Government ministers Kumara Welgama and Rohitha Abeygunawardena visited the scene to sort out the situation but Welgama's vehicle was stoned by the mob. The police were forced to use tear gas against the protesters. Three people were arrested over the violence. On 15 June 2014 the BBS staged rallies in Aluthgama, Beruwala and Dharga Town in Kalutara District. Addressing a cheering crowd in Aluthgama, BBS leader Galagoda Aththe Gnanasaara threatened \\"In this country we still have a Sinhala police; we still have a Sinhala army. After today if a single Marakkalaya [Muslim, in context used derogatorily] or some other paraya [alien, outcast, also a derogatory term] touches a single Sinhalese‚Ä¶..it will be their end.\\" Riots After its rally the BBS drove into Dharga Town chanting anti-Muslim slogans. Local residents started throwing stones at the BBS convoy which resulted in violent clashes erupting between the two groups. Eyewitnesses reported Muslim homes and a mosque being stoned. Muslims were pulled off buses and assaulted whilst the Buddhist mob threw Molotov cocktails, burning and looting Muslim shops and homes. Muslim residents were forced to flee from their homes and seek shelter in mosques and community centres. There was rioting in Beruwala as well. Special Task Force personnel were deployed to control the situation. The police imposed an indefinite curfew in Aluthgama at 6:45pm on 15 June 2014 and at 8:00pm in Beruwala. Despite the curfew BBS supporters wielding weapons were seen in the area. Muslim residents stated that the curfew was only for the Muslims, not for the rioters. According to local residents the police did nothing to help them. Some residents accused the police of helping the BBS. Three men who were trying to protect Welipitiya mosque in Dharga Town were shot dead in the early hours of 16 June 2014 by a group travelling in a vehicle. The victims were identified as labourer Mohammed Shiraz (30), shop keeper Mohammed Sahuran (40) and tile layer Mohammed Imran (41). More than 80 people were injured. The injured were taken to several local hospitals. 36 people, including seven who had been shot, were taken to Kalutara Base Hospital while seven others, including a police officer, were taken to Beruwala District Hospital. 10,000 people (8,000 Muslims and 2,000 Sinhalese) displaced by the riots sought shelter in schools, mosques and other community facilities. The curfew was later extended. By 16 June 2014 no arrests had been made in relation to the violence. After the police failed to restore order, around 50 military personnel were deployed in Aluthgama, Beruwala, Dharga Town, Maggona and Welipenna to maintain order. Local schools were closed on 16 June 2014. On the night of 16 June 2014 the riots spread to the Welipenna where a mob of 50-60 men armed with guns, Molotov cocktails and knives destroyed 26 shops and nine houses. Karuppan Sivalingam (58), an unarmed Tamil guard, was hacked to death and a Sinhalese farm worker seriously injured when a mob raided a Muslim owned chicken farm in Henagama near Welipenna. The curfew was temporarily lifted at 8.00am on 17 June 2014 before being re-imposed at 12.00pm. By 17 June 2014 10,000 police and Special Task Force personnel had been deployed in the area. According to the police 41 people had been arrested by 17 June 2014. The number of arrested later rose to 49. By 21 June 2014 58 people had been arrested, 36 of whom were remanded whilst the rest were released on police bail. Journalists covering the riots were also attacked by the mob. Sunday Leader journalist Binoy Suriyaarachchi was held hostage for several hours and his driver Upul was attacked. Sunday Times journalist Sarath Siriwardana was attacked by a mob in Aluthgama on the night of 15 June 2014. An Al Jazeera crew travelling between Mathugama and Aluthgama on 17 June 2014 were attacked by a mob who damaged their vehicle's windscreen. On 17 June 2014 the police obtained court order preventing the BBS from holding a rally in Mawanella. The curfew in Aluthgama and Beruwala was lifted at 8.00am on 18 June 2014. Aftermath A burnt-out house in Aluthgama Damaged vehicle in the aftermath of the riots Property damage in Aluthgama President Mahinda Rajapaksa, accompanied by government minister Mervyn Silva, visited Beruwala on 18 June 2014 to meet victims of the riots and promised an impartial inquiry. According to the president, the government would re-build homes and business destroyed by the riots. The president announced via social media on 21 June 2014 that he would appoint a high-level panel to investigate the riots. At a meeting in Badulla on 21 June 2014 Rajapaksa blamed \\"international forces\\" for a \\"concerted efforts to destabilise the country\\" and ordered a crackdown on hate groups. Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga and various other parliamentary ministers also condemned the attack. Moderate Buddhist monk Watareka Vijitha, who had been critical of the BBS, was abducted and assaulted in the Bandaragama area on 19 June 2014. Vijitha had been forcibly circumcised. The police later stated they would take action against Vijitha for giving false statements, saying that his injuries were self-inflicted. Vijitha was later charged by the police for making false allegations. Vijitha had been threatened by BBS leader Galagoda Aththe Gnanasaara in April 2014. He had gone into hiding following attempted assaults. Muslim businesses in Colombo, Eastern Province and Northern Province staged a hartal on 19 June 2014 as protest against the riots. Contrary to fears there was no violence after Jumma prayers on 20 June 2014. The Muslim owned No-Limit clothing store in Panadura was destroyed by fire in the early hours of 21 June 2014, causing Rs.400 million in damage. Witnesses reported seeing petrol bombs being thrown into the store. Police and Special Task Force personnel were deployed in the area. Schools in the riot affected re-opened on 23 June 2014. Sporadic attacks against Muslim targets continued in the days after the riots. Reaction President Rajapaksa, who was in Bolivia for the Group of 77 summit, issued statements via social media urging restraint and promising an investigation. The government then urged the media not to publish news about the riots which could cause \\"disharmony\\" amongst religious groups in the country. As a result, there was a virtual blackout about the violence in the mainstream media in Sri Lanka. Rajapaksa's United People‚Äôs Freedom Alliance (UPFA) government was divided over the riots. Rauff Hakeem, Minister of Justice and leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, has called for \\"an independent and transparent inquiry\\" into the riots which would bring to justice not just those responsible for the violence but also those allowed or encouraged religious zealotry. Risad Badhiutheen, Minister of Industry and Commerce and leader of the All Ceylon Muslim Congress, accused the BBS of instigating racial tensions and called upon the government to ban the BBS and take legal action against its leader Gnanasara. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Minister of National Languages and Social Integration and leader of the Democratic Left Front has called for BBS leader Gnanasaara and other BBS members to be arrested for instigating racial tensions which led to the riots. However, Champika Ranawaka, Minister of Technology, Research and Atomic Energy and leading member of the Jathika Hela Urumaya, blamed the violence on Muslim extremists and accused the United States of nurturing a Taliban in Sri Lanka. Rajapaksa has criticised ministers who were critical of the government's and police's response. At the 26 regular session of the United Nations Human Rights Council on 20 June 2014 the Sri Lankan government blamed Muslims for the riots. The BBS has denied responsibility for the riots, saying it did not organise the rally in Aluthgama on 15 June 2014. The main opposition United National Party (UNP) condemned the riots and blamed the governing United People‚Äôs Freedom Alliance for instigating the violence. UNP MP Mangala Samaraweera, a vocal critic of the Rajapaksa government, went as far as to name three senior military intelligence officers - General (retd) Kapila Hendawitharana (defence ministry advisor), Colonel Suresh Salley and Deputy Inspector General Chandra Wakishta (deputy chief of the State Intelligence Service) - whom he accused of instigating the violence. The violence was also condemned by religious leaders and civil society groups. Protesters hold placards as they demonstrate against the anti-Muslim violence, 17 June 2014 UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon expressed concern at the communal violence and urged the government to ensure the safety of all Sri Lankans. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay issued a statement on 16 June 2014 expressing alarm at the riots and urging the government to halt the violence and hate speech and bring the perpetrators to book. The European Union delegation in Colombo, with the support of the Norwegian, Swiss and Turkish embassies, issued a statement on 20 June 2014 condemning the violence and urging the government to uphold the rule of law. Organisation of Islamic Co-operation Secretary General Iyad bin Amin Madani expressed serious concern at the violence against Muslims and observed a rising trend of violence by extremists. The US embassy in Colombo also a statement on 16 June 2014 condemning the violence and urging the government to restore order and bring the perpetrators to justice. The following day United States Department of State spokesperson Jen Psaki stated that the US condemned the violence and blamed it on recent \\"inflammatory rhetoric\\". Canada's Ambassador for Religious Freedom Andrew P. W. Bennett issued a statement on 16 June 2014 condemning the communal violence against Muslims and calling for a swift and transparent investigation into the violence. Amnesty International urged the government to take action to end the violence immediately, rein in groups targeting religious minorities, protect Muslims and bring to account those responsible for the violence. Human Rights Watch has urged the government to urgently investigate the violence, and identify and investigative those responsible for the attacks on Muslims. The riots took place in a popular tourist area which prompted some foreign governments to issue travel advisories to their citizens.

It takes its name from the geographical region of the Cilento, much of which is today within the Parco Nazionale del Cilento, Vallo di Diano e Alburni, and is raised in that area, in the Monti Picentini, and throughout the province of Salerno. It is one of three indigenous goat breeds in the Cilento, the others being the Cilentana Grigia and the Cilentana Nera. The Cilentana Fulva is found on lower ground and richer pasture than the Cilentana Nera, and is raised mainly for milk. It appears to derive from inter-breeding of local goats with the Maltese and particularly the Derivata di Siria, with which it shares many characteristics. The Cilentana Fulva is one of the forty-three autochthonous Italian goat breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep- and goat-breeders.

Previously a foundation school administered by Swindon Borough Council, it converted to academy status in August 2011 and is part of the White Horse Federation, a multi-academy trust. The school continues to coordinate with Swindon Borough Council for admissions. The school's catchment area includes Bishopstone, Hinton Parva, Wanborough, Liddington, Coate, Badbury, Chiseldon, Hodson, Bassett Down, Uffcott, Broad Hinton and Winterbourne Bassett. The school offers GCSEs and BTECs as programmes of study for pupils, while students in the sixth form have the option to study from a range of A-levels and further BTECs. Controversy In 2005, in an attempt to aid integration after the 7 July 2005 London bombings, the local council began sending British Asian youth from Swindon (outside the regular catchment area) to the school. Some of this group formed a gang called the \\"Asian Invasion\\", who bullied other pupils. On 11 January 2007, Henry Webster, a 15-year-old singled out for his red hair and large size, stood up to a member of the \\"Asian Invasion\\" and agreed for a one- on-one fight. However, the boy showed up with several others, including adults and Webster suffered injuries including brain damage from a hammer. In February 2008, four people were convicted for the attack. By May, 13 had been convicted. In February 2010, the High Court of Justice ruled in favour of the school when it was sued by Webster and his family. He had claimed that although the attack was outside school hours, it had been caused by the school's lack of action against the \\"Asian Invasion\\". In September that year, a case review was published about the situation at the school, which recommended that all incidents of bullying should record the ethnicity of perpetrators and victims to look for racial motivations.

The Republic of Venda ceased to exist on 27 April 1994 and the Venda Defence Force was amalgamated with six other military forces into the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). (Accessed 1 May 2015)Warrant of the President of the Republic of South Africa for the Institution of the \\"UNITAS MEDAL- UNITAS-MEDALJE\\", Gazette no. 16087 dated 25 November 1994. Institution The Distinguished Service Medal, Silver was instituted by the President of Venda in 1985. It is the middle award of a set of three decorations for merit, along with the Distinguished Service Medal, Gold and the Venda Defence Force Medal. Venda's military decorations and medals were modeled on those of the Republic of South Africa and these three decorations are the approximate equivalents of, respectively, the Southern Cross Decoration and Pro Merito Decoration, the Southern Cross Medal (1975) and Pro Merito Medal (1975), and the Military Merit Medal. Award criteria The medal could be awarded to all ranks for outstanding service and devotion to duty. Order of wear Since the Distinguished Service Medal, Silver was authorised for wear by one of the statutory forces which came to be part of the South African National Defence Force on 27 April 1994, it was accorded a position in the official South African order of precedence on that date.Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 477, no. 27376, Pretoria, 11 March 2005, ;Venda Defence Force until 26 April 1994: Distinguished Service Medal, Gold Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Venda Defence Force Medal *Official VDF order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Distinguished Service Medal, Gold. ** Succeeded by the Venda Defence Force Medal. *Venda official national order of precedence: ** Preceded by the National Force Outstanding Service Medal (SOE). ** Succeeded by the Police Star for Outstanding Service (SOE). ;South African National Defence Force from 27 April 1994: Pro Merito Medal (1967) (PMM) Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Southern Cross Medal (1975) (SM) *Official SANDF order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Pro Merito Medal (1967) (PMM) of the Republic of South Africa. ** Succeeded by the Southern Cross Medal (1975) (SM) of the Republic of South Africa. *Official national order of precedence: ** Preceded by the KwaZulu Police Star for Outstanding Service. ** Succeeded by the Police Star for Outstanding Service (SOE) of the Republic of Venda. The position of the Distinguished Service Medal, Silver in the official order of precedence was revised twice after 1994, to accommodate the inclusion or institution of new decorations and medals, first in April 1996 when decorations and medals were belatedly instituted for the two former non-statutory forces, the Azanian People's Liberation Army and Umkhonto we Sizwe, and again upon the institution of a new set of honours on 27 April 2003, but it remained unchanged on both occasions. The Distinguished Service Medal, Silver is, in effect, Venda's equivalent of the South African Southern Cross Medal (1975) and Pro Merito Medal (1975). It would appear, therefore, as though the position of the Distinguished Service Medal, Silver, instituted in 1985, in the official order of precedence was allocated in error. According to their dates of institution, it should have taken precedence after the Pro Merito Medal (1975) and not after the Pro Merito Medal (1967). Its correct position in the order of wear would therefore be after Bophuthatswana's Defence Force Merit Medal of 1982 and before Ciskei's Sandile Medal of 1988.

Attfield's research focuses on synthesis, structural studies, and property measurements for electronic materials such as transition metal oxides. His research has been funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). Attfield has made significant contributions to the study of the Verwey transition in magnetite, solving its charge ordering properties. Paul Attfield has made distinctive contributions to the experimental understanding of structure in the solid- state, in particular pioneering the use of resonant X-ray scattering to study cation and valence ordering effects and characterising charge-order in strongly correlated systems such as magnetite. He introduced the cation-size variance as a concept to rationalise and predict disorder effects, with a substantial impact on the study and preparation of technologically important materials. He has synthesised and characterised new materials with novel electronic properties, including high-Tc superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, and negative thermal expansion, including new developments in chemical synthesis. =Awards and honours= Attfield was awarded the Meldola Medal and Prize by the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) in 1991; the Corday-Morgan Medal of the RSC in 1998; and the Peter Day Award in 2013.

Intended for an audience of women, it debuted in 1954 as one of NBC's three major non-primetime shows. While the other two shows‚ÄîToday and Tonight‚Äîare still being produced 60 years later, Home was cancelled in 1957. Format Each hour-long show is presented in a series of short segments which discuss topics in a depth typical of a magazine article. A segment may be either entertaining or informational. Topics typically relate to homemaking but may also include civic, cultural, and social issues and interviews with newsmakers.Cassidy 2005, p. 138. Twelve minutes of each broadcast are devoted to the promotion of consumer goods from the show's sponsors; these commercials often take place within the informational segments of the show itself.Stole 1997, p. 145. Instead of imitating the look of an actual house as cooking shows did, Home's producers made it obvious that it was taking place in a modern television studio. The $200,000 revolving set had a kitchen, a workshop, and an area to demonstrate the effects of weather on the sponsors' products.Cassidy 2005, pp. 149‚Äì150. A garden area contained soil samples from each of the 48 U.S. states; an additional sample to represent Washington, D.C., was provided by Vice President Richard Nixon.Stole 1997, pp. 149‚Äì150.  On-air staff  Arlene Francis hosted the program as editor-in-chief with Hugh Downs serving as her announcer and assistant. Music was performed by the Norman Paris Trio and singer Johnny Johnston. The team of editors presenting segments on particular topics included Poppy Cannon (food), Rose Franzblau (family relations and child psychology), Eve Hunter (fashion and beauty), Sydney Smith (interior decorating), Estelle Parsons (special projects), Leona Baumgartner (health), and Will Peigelbeck (gardening and home repairs).Cassidy 2005, p. 137.  History  NBC executive Sylvester \\"Pat\\" Weaver began planning a concept called Shopping in late 1951, intending to attract an audience of upper middle class women. Its content and segmented format were inspired by the success of women's magazines, local cooking shows, and the NBC network's Today show. By aiming for a particular target demographic, the network hoped to attract sponsors from women's magazines who would not be interested in advertising on a show meant for the masses.Stole 1997, pp. 140‚àí142.Cassidy 2005, p. 135. Three talk shows that Weaver created (Today, Home, and Tonight) were intended to complement each other and were referred to as the \\"T-H-T\\" package.Stole 1997, p. 135.Cassidy 2005, p. 133. These programs helped to establish the practice of selling advertising rights to several temporary sponsors. The usual practice at the time involved a single sponsor being responsible for an entire television series.Stole 1997, p. 145. After spending $1 million promoting Home, NBC predicted that 10% of television- equipped U.S. households would watch the program. This rating fell to about 3 by the month after Home's March 1, 1954, premiere. The network responded to these low ratings by adding more entertaining segments.Stole 1997, pp. 148, 150‚Äì151. Although the series was nominated for a 1956 Emmy Award for Best Contribution to Daytime Programming, it continued to have low ratings. That same year it was moved from 11:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., a timeslot with less competition. In that season Home had a rating of 2.5, whereas CBS's 10:00 and 10:30 programs were at 6.5 and 7.5, respectively.Cassidy 2005, p. 154. The 893rd and final episode of Home was broadcast on August 9, 1957.Timberg 2002, pp. 41‚Äì42.

Part 1, Species from Peru, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay. Bulletin of the AMNH; no. 224.\\" (1995). The species can be distinguished from C. tecka by not having a patterned cephalothorax and legs, by possessing less maxillary cuspules and by the absence of pseudopreening combs. It also differs from C. sanjuanina by having few labial cuspules. Description The female of the species has a total length of ; a cephalothorax length of , and a width of . Its labium length is 45% of its width; its sternum width is 66% of the length. Its labium possesses two cuspules, while the maxillae has six cuspules. A serrula is absent. Its cephalothorax is yellowish, with brown mottles on its caput and posterior part of its thorax; the abdomen is yellowish with mottles. Pubescence is very light. Behaviour and distribution The spiders of this species make a small burrow closed with a thin, flaplike door. The door is made from the silk layer lining the interior of the burrow, covered by grains of sand. As the spiders dig their burrow on inclined places (about 45 degrees), the sand falls over it when the flap is closed, covering the burrow fully. The burrows are about in diameter, and deep; its walls consist of a silk tube which prevents the sand from collapsing. It has only been found at its type locality.

The species is remarkable by its male amputating one of its palps before maturation and entering his adult life with one palp only. It adopts exceptional copulatory behaviour: when the male achieves genitalia coupling with his palp, the latter is torn off by the female. The separated gonopod remains attached to the female's epigynum for approximately 4 hours and continues to function independently, serving as a mating plug. While this happens, the female feeds on the male. Emasculation thus synchronizes sexual cannibalism and sperm transfer, lengthening the interval between copulations. This mating behaviour might allow for the continuation of insemination by the dismembered palp.

It takes its name from the geographical region of the Cilento, much of which is today within the Parco Nazionale del Cilento, Vallo di Diano e Alburni, and is raised mainly in that area, but also in the Monti Alburni and the Monti Picentini. It is one of three indigenous goat breeds in the Cilento, the others being the Cilentana Fulva and the Cilentana Nera. The Cilentana Grigia is found on lower ground and richer pasture than the Cilentana Nera, and is raised mainly for milk. The origins of the breed are obscure; it shows the influence of the Maltese and Garganica breeds, and similarities to other Italian grey breeds such as the Ciociara Grigia of Lazio and the Argentata dell'Etna from Sicily. The Cilentana Grigia is one of the forty-three autochthonous Italian goat breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep- and goat-breeders.

He is the former Emir of the Dulaim tribe, a position now held by his brother, Abdulrazzaq Hatem Abd al-Razzaq Ali al- Suleiman al-Assafi al-Dulaimi. Early life Suleiman was born in Baghdad in 1971.Al-Anbar Awakening Vol II: Iraqi Perspectives, p.107 His father, Abdul Razzaq, was the emir of the Dulaim tribe, one of the largest Arab tribes in Iraq. His grandfather, Ali al-Suleiman, led the confederation during the founding of Iraq. Its members are predominantly located in the Al Anbar Governorate.http://www.aawsat.net/2014/06/article55333359 Iraq War Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Suleiman joined the Iraqi insurgency. His own tribe formed the nucleus of the resistance/insurgency against US forces and Shiite government forces in Iraq, due to the bombing of Fallujah and the targeting of Sunnis in Baghdad. However, in 2006 he and his armed tribesmen turned against Al-Qaeda, due to their often indiscriminate use of violence, as well as the fact that Al-Qaeda did not give enough respect to Anbar's sheikhs. Suleiman joined the Sons of Iraq movement, although he looked down on its leader, Sheikh Abdul Sattar Abu Risha, due to the small size of the Abu Risha tribe.Malkasian, Illusions of Victory, p. 162. After leaving the insurgency, Suleiman became an important figure in Anbar. He formed a local police force of 60,000 gunmen from his tribe in Anbar. Suleiman formed a political party, National Front for the Salvation of Iraq, in 2008. It ran as part of the State of Law Coalition of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, but quickly disagreements appeared, after the arrest of 10 men from his tribe in Ar Rutba, by the Karbala police. In response to the incident, Suleiman threaten to declare the State of Anbar. Suleiman formed another party (Baariq Iraq). However, his political party was banned from participating in the elections in 2014. After the withdrawal of US troops, the Shiite government forces started to arrest Dulaimi civilians and killed them in Anbar. Suleiman, his brother Sheikh Abdulrazzaq, and other sheikhs of the tribe set up weekly demonstrations in Ramadi in the Square of Pride and Dignity, for one year, demanding the release of Sunni detainees and the withdrawal of the army from the cities in Anbar. The government responded by killing ali al-Alwani and arresting his brother, Sunni MP Ahmed al-Alwani, from the Dulaim tribe (Albo-alon clan). As a result, the Dulaimis returned to the armed insurgency led by Suleiman. Suleiman formed the Military Council of the tribal rebels in Al-Anbar. He announced in a statement that Sunni territories will not be part of Iraq under Shiite rule. 2013‚Äì14 anti-government offensives Flag of Suleiman's group, the Revolutionary Tribal Council. In 2013 and 2014, Suleiman was the leader of the Anbar Tribes Revolutionary Council, an anti-government militant group active in the ongoing Anbar clashes. Unlike some of the other groups active in anti- government activity, Suleiman's force does not advocate the overthrow of the Iraqi government, but instead is limited in ambition to defending Anbar from what it sees as aggression from the Iraqi central government. Suleiman was involved in the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, and he claimed that ISIL only constitutes 5‚Äì7% of the anti-government forces. He claimed that the majority of fighters are from Iraq's Sunni tribes. Suleiman also claimed that these tribal forces would be able to defeat ISIL, were the Maliki-run Iraqi government to withdraw government forces from north and north-central Iraq. However, Suleiman claimed that tribal forces would not fight ISIL until Maliki was removed from office and Sunnis are given their rights. In early 2015, during the Battle of Ramadi, ISIL overran Suleiman's lands and forced him to retreat to Erbil, in Iraqi Kurdistan.Malkasian, Illusions of Victory, p. 182.

The song, written by Ray Davies, appeared on the band's album, Word of Mouth.

Ray Davies said of this: Release \\"Good Day\\" was first released as a single in Britain (as well as Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden) in August 1984, backed with \\"Too Hot\\" (both songs would appear on Word of Mouth.) A maxi-single, with \\"Don't Forget to Dance\\" added to the two tracks already on the 7 inch single, was also released in the UK. \\"Good Day\\", however, was unsuccessful, as it did not chart in any country. In November of that year, \\"Good Day\\" appeared as the third track on the first side of The Kinks' album, Word of Mouth. Word of Mouth was a modest success in America (hitting #57), but the album did not achieve the Top 20 success that its predecessors State of Confusion, Give the People What They Want, and Low Budget had.

He has consulted for The World Bank, The United Nations, the Carter Center, the United States Agency for International Development, the National Democratic Institute, and the International Republican Institute. Gibson has done influential work on electoral fraud. Gibson graduated with a bachelor's degree from the University of Notre Dame, then joined the Peace Corps, serving in Nepal. Gibson left Nepal for medical reasons, subsequently working as a paralegal and high school teacher before beginning graduate study in political science at Duke University. While working on his doctoral dissertation, Gibson conducted field work in Zambia, Africa where he studied wildlife politics and poaching in national parks. While in Zambia, Gibson encountered a group of election observers led by Jimmy Carter and became involved in work on election monitoring and electoral fraud, eventually leading to Gibson's work in a variety of countries. Gibson received his Ph.D. from Duke, then held several positions at Indiana University. While at I.U., he worked on common pool resources with political economist Elinor Ostrom PhD at her Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis. Ostrom subsequently won the Nobel Prize in Economics with Oliver E. Williamson for her \\"analysis of economic governance, especially the commons\\". In 2001, Gibson joined the Department of Political Science at the University of California, San Diego as a tenured faculty member. Gibson's academic work has mainly concentrated on issues and countries in Africa. He has undertaken extensive studies on the subjects of foreign aid and political accountability. Most recently, he has worked on using technology, specifically cellphones, to minimize electoral fraud in Afghanistan, Uganda, Kenya, and South Africa. Gibson's work, coauthored with Karen Ferree and James Long, helped to point to discrepancies in the controversial results of 2007 Kenyan elections. Gibson conducted an extensive exit poll in the election on behalf of the International Republican Institute and USAID. After the election poll's results were made available by Gibson, Feree, and Long, the results became subject to controversy due to the International Republican Institute's delay in releasing the poll results. The delay and its impact on public perceptions on the validity of the elections received international press.

The series is famous for its western animation-style graphics and convoluted decades-long history of being ported to many platforms and being remade into television and comic book series. The first game in the series is titled Dragon's Lair, originally released for arcades in 1983 by Cinematronics. It uses laserdisc technology, offering greatly superior graphics compared to other video games at the time. The game was ported to several other platforms, but as no home system technology of that era could accommodate the graphical quality of LaserDisc, several abridged versions of the original game were released under different names. The first true sequel, Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp, would only appear in 1991. While its graphics were once again praised, the poor controls and limited interactivity kept it from reaching the popularity of the original. The two main games in the series are considered gaming classics and are constantly re-released for each new generation of consoles. In 2010, they were bundled alongside the unrelated 1984 Bluth Group game Space Ace in the Dragon's Lair Trilogy which was made available across numerous platforms. Forays into other media include a short lived animated series that aired on ABC in 1984 and a comic-book miniseries released in 2003. Plans for a feature-length film have existed since the 1980s and have resurfaced in 2015, when Bluth launched a crowd-funding campaign to secure funds for a Dragon's Lair movie pitch. A Kickstarter campaign was unsuccessful, and a second campaign on Indiegogo reached its target in early 2016. Games * Dragon's Lair is a laserdisc video game published by Cinematronics in 1983. In the game, the protagonist Dirk the Daring is a knight attempting to rescue Princess Daphne from the evil dragon Singe who has locked the princess in the foul wizard Mordroc's castle. It featured animation by ex-Disney animator Don Bluth. Most other games of the era represented the character as a sprite, which consisted of a series of pixels displayed in succession. Due to hardware limitations of the era, artists were greatly restricted in the detail they could achieve using that technique; the resolution, framerate, and number of frames were severely constrained. Dragon's Lair overcame those limitations by tapping into the vast storage potential of the LaserDisc but imposed other limitations on the actual gameplay. The game can freeze as the laserdisc searches for the correct scene to play, and the cabinets are difficult to maintain. It was advertised as the first truly 3D video game and as the meeting point of video games and animated films. The success of the game sparked numerous home ports, sequels, and related games. In the 21st century, it has been repackaged in a number of formats (such as for the iPhone) as a \\"retro\\" or historic game. It is currently one of only three video games (along with Pong and Pac-Man) in storage at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. * Escape from Singe's Castle, also known as Dragon's Lair Part II - Escape From Singe's Castle is a 1987 video game published by Software Projects for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum home computers. Later, Readysoft made the Amiga, Atari ST, and PC versions. The game is sometimes referred to as Dragon's Lair II but is not to be confused with the official arcade sequel Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp. * Dragon's Lair is a 1990 platform game developed by MotiveTime and published by CSG Imagesoft in North America, Elite Systems in Europe and Epic/Sony Records in Japan for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Its plot is identical to that of the original game. * Dragon's Lair: The Legend is a 1991 platform game developed by Elite Systems and published by CSG Imagesoft in North America, Elite Software in Europe and Epic/Sony Records in Japan for the Game Boy. This is actually a port of Elite's 1985 ZX Spectrum game Roller Coaster. * Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp is the first official sequel other than Escape from Singe's Castle. Released in 1991 by Leland Corporation, its story takes place years later. Dirk has married Daphne, and the marriage has produced several children. When Daphne is kidnapped by the evil wizard Mordroc in order to be forced into marriage, Dirk's children are clearly upset by the abduction of their mother, and Dirk must once again save her. Home ports of the game were announced for the Philips CD-i, 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, and Jaguar CD. However, only the CD-i version was actually released, though non-playable demos of the 3DO and Jaguar CD versions appear on those consoles' respective versions of Brain Dead 13. The game was later ported to the Wii as part of the compilation release Dragon's Lair Trilogy. * Dragon's Lair III: The Curse of Mordread was made for Amiga, Atari ST, and PC in 1993, mixing original footage with scenes from Time Warp that were not included in the original PC release due to memory constraints. The game also included a newly produced \\"Blackbeard the Pirate\\" stage that was originally intended to be in the arcade game but was never completed. * Dragon's Lair is a 1993 platform game developed by MotiveTime and published by Data East in North America, Elite Systems in Europe and Konami in Japan for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Its plot is identical to that of the original game. * Dragon's Lair 3D: Return to the Lair was developed in 2002, as a 3D interpretation of the game developed by Dragonstone Software and published by Ubisoft for Microsoft Windows, Xbox, GameCube and the PlayStation 2. It is based on the original Dragon's Lair and follows a similar story as Dirk must enter Mordroc's castle to rescue Princess Daphne from a dragon. Many of the characters and locations from the 1983 original make appearances in the game, along with new puzzles, rooms, and enemies. The game uses cel shading to mimic the distinctive style of the original. Bluth produced two new animated sequences for the opening and ending of the game. It received mixed reviews. In 2005, Digital Leisure created a new Dragon's Lair III which utilizes 3D footage from Dragon's Lair 3D but has a control system like the original arcade games. Dragon's Lair led to the creation of 1984's Space Ace, another game animated by Don Bluth and his crew. Space Ace is a ROM and disc upgrade kit for the Dragon's Lair cabinets, complete with new control panel overlay, side art, and header. Gameplay Players have five controls: up, down, left, right, and attack. Gameplay consists of reacting to on-screen button prompts which trigger pre-drawn success or failure animations, essentially a forerunner of the modern Quick Time Event. A perfect run with no deaths lasts no more than 12 minutes. In total, the game has 22 minutes or 50,000 frames of animated footage, including individual death scenes and game over screens. Characters =Dirk the Daring= Dirk the Daring is the main protagonist of the first game and subsequent franchise. As a knight of the kingdom, Dirk was entrusted with the rescue of Princess Daphne from Mordroc and Singe because all other knights were killed. He becomes heir to the throne upon saving Princess Daphne; following her rescue, Dirk and Daphne are married. In both games, Dirk is voiced by sound editor Dan Molina. Retro Gamer included him on their list of top 50 game characters in the category \\"Top Ten Forces of Good\\" and called him \\"without a doubt, the epitome of the heroic knight\\".Retro Gamer 2, page 37. =Princess Daphne= In the games, Princess Daphne is the beautiful daughter of King Aethelred and an unnamed queen. She serves as the series' damsel in distress, a beautiful maiden coveted by many princes and knights, her heart belongs to the kingdom's champion, Dirk the Daring. Adaptations The game led to the creation of a short-lived television cartoon series, Dragon's Lair by Ruby-Spears Productions, where Dirk the Daring is voiced by Bob Sarlatte and the unseen storyteller that narrates each episode is voiced by Clive Revill. Changes in the TV series include the originally nameless Dragon being given the name Singe (voiced by Arthur Burghardt), Princess Daphne (voiced by Ellen Gerstell) wears a long pink dress, and includes some exclusive characters like Princess Daphne's father King Ethelred (voiced by Fred Travalena), Dirk the Daring's horse Bertram (vocal effects provided by Peter Cullen), Dirk the Daring's squire Timothy (voiced by Michael Mish), and Dirk the Daring's rival Sir Hubert Blunt (voiced by Peter Cullen). Enemies include the Lizard King, the Phantom Knight, the Giddy Goons, and the Mudmen. Thirteen half-hour episodes were produced and aired on the ABC network from September 8, 1984, to April 27, 1985. It was last aired on the USA Cartoon Express between the late '80s and the early '90s. To keep the show in the spirit of the game, before each commercial break the storyteller asks what the viewer would do to solve the problem facing Dirk. After the commercial break, the outcomes of the various choices are shown before Dirk acts on the correct idea (with the occasional exception) to save the day. Don Bluth had no involvement in the TV series. A comic book miniseries based on the game, but incorporating elements from the cartoon series as well, like Dirk's horse Bertram, was released in 2003 by CrossGen, concurrent with a miniseries based on Space Ace. Arcana Studio published the entire comic book series in 2006, as there are three issues that were previously unpublished. =Film= In the 1980s, a film version of Dragon's Lair was planned, with Alan Dean Foster involved in shaping the story. The project fell apart due to low interest from other studios.Cawley, John. Games on TV and The Big Screen In 2015 and 2016, Bluth and Goldman crowdfunded for a 10-minute teaser for an animated feature-length Dragon's Lair prequel film, their first feature film since Titan A.E.. Bluth and Goldman have announced that the film will provide more backstory for Dirk and Daphne and that Daphne will show that she is not a \\"blonde airhead\\". In March 2020, the film was approved by Netflix after one year of negotiations. Ryan Reynolds was in talks for the lead role. Reynolds, Roy Lee, Trevor Engelson, Bluth, Goldman, and former Bluth collaborator John Pomeroy are producers, with Dan and Kevin Hageman as writers.

In the spring of 170 A.D. swarms of German warrior bands attacked Roman provinces along the Danube River. In furtherance of this endeavor, and for mutual protection, the king of the Marcomanni, Ballomar, had formed an alliance with the Quadi tribe. Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius with his son-in-law and chief military adviser Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus crossed the Danube River to drive back the raiders. The Romans and Germans met outside Carnuntum in Upper Pannonia,Now called Petronell-Carnuntum which was the headquarters for the 14th Legion. The Roman army was inexperienced and outmatched, and the ensuing battle was a disaster for the Romans. Although the legions fought hard and bravely, they were no match for the Germanic warriors. 20,000 Romans were killed. Following this victory the Germans besieged Aquileia and sacked Opitergium. Carnuntum was the worst Roman defeat in a century. Historiography There is only one ancient source for the battle and that is LucianLucian of Samosata in his book Alexander·ºàŒªŒ≠ŒæŒ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÇ ·º¢ Œ®ŒµœÖŒ¥œåŒºŒ±ŒΩœÑŒπœÇ which is either a polemic or a witty satire aimed at Alexander of Abonoteichus, depending on the point of view. The description of 20,000 Roman dead might have been dismissed by historians, were it not for the fact that other historical information in that work is supported by independent ancient authors and by epigraphical and numismatic evidence. The chronology of events of the Marcomannic Wars has a number of problems, but scholars now agree that these events took place in the Spring of 170 A.D.

The pall design includes two diagonal white stripes (from the bottom left and top left corners) converging in the circular center to form a horizontal white stripe. Red silhouettes of a Miami Native American head (center left), a French fleur-de-lis (top right), and a British lion (bottom right) grace a navy blue field. A red blockhouse is located at the center of the converging stripes, with the settlement's founding date and city name. History In commemoration of Indiana's centennial festivities in 1916, the Journal Gazette sponsored a contest to design a flag for the city of Fort Wayne. Guy Drewett's original winning design included the current white 'Y' stripes on a blue field, but also included two white stars. Each star was located where the fleur-de-lis and lion are on the current design. Drewett redesigned the flag in 1934 under the guidance of veteran and historian Col. Clyde Dreisbach in 1934. The new design discarded the two white stars (symbolizing Fort Wayne's status as the state's second largest city) for icons specific to its history. This current design was officially adopted by City Council on June 26, 1934. A survey of flag design quality by the North American Vexillological Association ranked Fort Wayne's flag 52nd of 150 American city flags. It earned a score 4.62 out of 10.

Burdick was born in Canajoharie, New York. He married Anna Higley in 1828. In 1834, the Burdicks heard the preaching of missionary Sidney Rigdon and joined the Church of the Latter Day Saints led by Joseph Smith. The Burdicks moved to Kirtland, Ohio to join the main gathering of Latter Day Saints and Burdick was made an elder in the church. In 1836, he was given the responsibility of managing the membership records of the church. On November 7, 1837, Burdick became a high priest and a member of the presiding high council at Kirtland. In 1838, Burdick was one of the twelve high priests selected by Bishop Newel K. Whitney to constitute the first sitting of the Common Council of the Church, which heard charges levied by Sylvester Smith against Joseph Smith. Burdick also taught school and was a justice of the peace in Kirtland. In 1838‚Äì39, after the majority of Latter Day Saints left Kirtland, Burdick remained. He was appointed the church bishop in Kirtland on May 22, 1841. After the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, Burdick followed the leadership of Brigham Young and made plans to follow Young west. Burdick remained in Kanesville, Iowa until 1853, when he led a Mormon pioneer company of over 100 wagons to Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. After arriving in Salt Lake City, most of the company, including Burdick, determined to carry on to the Mormon settlement of San Bernardino, California. In the winter of 1853‚Äì54, Burdick and his family settled at San Gabriel Township, California. In 1855, Burdick was elected as a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors; he served two consecutive one-year terms. Burdick died in Los Angeles of apoplexy. He and his wife were the parents of seven children. Their son Cyrus Burdick was the co-founder of Pomona, California. Burdick's sister was Rebecca Burdick Winters, a Mormon pioneer known for her grave site along the Mormon Trail.

It drains an approximately watershed.\\"Stream report for McAleer Creek\\". King County Water and Land Resources Division. Retrieved 6 September 2014. It is a salmon- bearing stream that also provides habitat to cutthroat trout, as well as watering a series of riparian areas, mostly in Lake Forest Park.\\"A Salmon's Guide to Lake Forest Park\\" . Lake Forest Park Stewardship Foundation. Pages 5-9. December 2006. Accessed 6 September 2014. McAleer Creek has the name of Hugh McAleer, a pioneer landowner. Course McAleer Creek rises on the southeast side of Lake Ballinger and for its whole course runs generally southeast. It first flows through Nile Golf Course in Mountlake Terrace. It enters a culvert under Interstate 5 and emerges into the Lake Forest Park flood control system. It then flows through residential streets and a wooded ravine until it passes under Perkins Way, where it joins Whisper Creek as the latter flows southward. The stream emerges into the woods once again, following Perkins and later 180th Street Northeast, entering another culvert to flow under 178th Street Northeast. It opens once more as it flows into Blue Heron Park, then moving under Bothell Way into a series of weirs and fish ladders. The stream then empties into Lake Washington near the intersection of 168th Street Northeast and Shore Drive. Ecology McAleer Creek supports the habitat of numerous locally important bird and fish species. Birds nesting in the stream's canyon include hawks, kingfishers, and herons, and fish it bears include salmon, trout, and bass. Many segments of the creek's route are shaded, benefiting the fish, but others are open to the sun and subject to overheating. One of McAleer Creek's greatest environmental challenges is erosion and the associated transportation of sediments. Besides the threat turbidity poses to fish, this issue has also caused serious property damage. The most notable incident was a landslide in 1981, when an eroded bluff collapsed into the stream, blocking it until it was cleared by volunteers. Between 1979 and 2004, however, the amount of total suspended solids in the water decreased. The stream has additional issues with low dissolved oxygen levels and high fecal coliform bacterial counts. In 2012, the Washington Department of Ecology cited McAleer Creek as violating its standards for these two water quality measures. The fecal bacteria count is usually elevated by septic system spills and pet waste.

Originally published in Spanish in 2011, the book explores the Colombian drug trade. It won the 2011 Alfaguara Prize. An English translation by Anne McLean was released in 2013 and won the 2014 International Dublin Literary Award. Synopsis The Sound of Things Falling is the story of a law professor named Antonio Yammara, who narrates the novel. Scenes switch between the 1990s Bogot√° (the present), where everything is falling apart as the result of the drug wars, and the past where the drug trade seem interwoven into everyone's lives. The text begins with Yammara giving a brief description of his early life. He began as a professor, who met Aura in one of his classes. She exchanged sexual favors with Antonio in exchange for higher grades in his classes and falls pregnant. Antonio also frequents a local pool hall, in which he meets ex-con Ricardo Laverde. They begin playing pool together and Antonio quickly becomes interested in the man's mysterious past. Although Antonio claims that he and Ricardo are not friends, the nature of their relationship quickly becomes closer and Ricardo begins to confide in Antonio. Upon receiving a mysterious cassette, Ricardo sets out to find a cassette player. He listens to the tape and becomes distraught. He begins walking quickly down the street, with Antonio in close pursuit. As they are drawing near the pool hall, a motorbike descends from the curb and guns them down. Ricardo is killed and Antonio badly injured. After the accident, Antonio becomes fixated upon Ricardo's life and withdraws from all other aspects of existence. His relationship with Aura deteriorates quickly and he becomes scared of the area of the city close to the pool hall. He is contacted by Ricardo's daughter Maya, who knows much of her estranged father's story. Antonio absconds from his home without telling Aura in an attempt to chase this lead. He learns that Ricardo was a pilot who was caught smuggling drugs into the United States and given a 19-year jail sentence. Maya's mother had returned to her native United States when Maya turned 18, and died in a plane crash when attempting to visit Maya and Ricardo after he got out of jail. As the novel progresses, Antonio and Maya's relationship takes a sexual turn. Antonio had not told Maya about his family back in Bogota. As the text ends, Antonio returns home and finds that Aura has left Antonio, along with the baby. V√°squez wrote The Sound of Things Falling to explore how the drug trade affects those not involved in it, but forced to live in areas where drug cartels exercise considerable power. He drew on his own personal experience, \\"remembering for the first time what it was like to grow up during the drug wars\\", for inspiration. While writing he realized \\"I was doing something which hadn't been done before. We had all grown up used to the public side of the drug wars, to the images and killings ... but there wasn't a place to go to think about the private side ... How did it change the way we behaved as fathers and sons and friends and lovers, how did it change our private behavior?\\" Publication El ruido de las cosas al caer was published in Spanish in 2011. It was subsequently translated into English by Anne McLean and published by Riverhead Books in 2013. Reception Writing for The New York Times, Edmund White called The Sound of Things Falling a \\"gripping novel, absorbing right to the end\\". He described it as a \\"brilliant\\" work featuring \\"the bitter poetry of Bogot√° and the hushed intensity of young married love\\" and \\"well imagined, original and rounded\\" characters. Also writing for The New York Times, Dwight Garner remarks \\"V√°squez is an estimable writer. His prose ... is literate and dignified.\\" He said that parts the book \\"quickens beautifully and sweeps us aloft\\" but at other times it is \\"remote, portentous, burped shut\\". He blamed translation for some awkward metaphors and said V√°squez is a talented writer but \\"sometimes seems more interested in poetic generalities than in squirming people.\\" Awards El ruido de las cosas al caer won the 2011 Alfaguara Prize.Juan Gabriel V√°squez gan√≥ el premio Alfaguara de novela In 2014, the English translation of The Sound of Things Falling won the International Dublin Literary Award, at ‚Ç¨100,000 one of the world's richest literary awards. It was nominated for the prize by the Biblioteca Daniel Cos√≠o Villegas, one of 150 libraries across 38 countries that provide the annual nomination list. The judging panel called the novel a \\"consummate literary thriller\\" with \\"a masterly command of layered time periods, spiraling mysteries and a noir palette\\". V√°squez won 75% of the ‚Ç¨100,000 prize, with the other 25% going to McLean. V√°squez said he would use to prize to keep reading and writing books. He is the first South American to win the prize, and The Sound of Things Falling is the second novel after A Heart So White originally written in Spanish to win it.
